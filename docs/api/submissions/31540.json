I haven't started my welding program, and I'm waiting to get more hours at work. I've been there 2 weeks, they're not going to put me on full time right away, but I was promised more hours by the end of the year. My parents know all of this as well\n\nEdit 2: We originally had a deal where I offered 10% of my income, that only changed after my first check went through. Then they wanted $500\n\nFor some context: I make a few hundred dollars a week, I get paid biweekly, and I make roughly $600-800 per month. I have no issue with paying a reasonable amount, but they want to charge $500 monthly for 1 room, and the house isn't massive but there's enough room for me to take over the basement, I'm more worried about my things being stolen.\n\nI talked to my parents after graduation in June, and they brought up the idea of me paying rent, but I quickly shot it down bc of my plans not including a summer job, as well as NY laws that essentially say that in order to rent a living space, it MUST include a bedroom, bathroom, and kitchen, our basement has none of those. My bedroom is technically not one, it used to be a recording studio, and the house is a 3 bed 1 bath. I told them that if they want me to pay to live there, they must renovate the basement and make it an apartment, bc If I'm paying half the mortgage, I should get that much worth of space.\n\nPreviously when talking about me staying at home there was a general \"get some savings and pocket money so you can move out with stability\" A.K.A. no rent. But when my first check went through, that changed, and I was told they were expecting $500 by the end of the month. I reminded them about what I told them months ago, and that I wasn't paying rent without more space, and it being a legal space.\n\nMy dad said I'm being unreasonable, and that I don't need the space, but I responded with \"if I'm going to be treated like a tenant, I'm going to get authorities involved because my space is technically illegal\". He got even more pissed, and I left him in the living room after telling him that we need to either work something out with me getting more space or he needs to dramatically lower his price, and that I wouldn't pay anything until we had that talk.\n\nFast forward to today, I bought about $150 worth of games on Xbox massively on sale, and he yelled at me for spending my money before I paid my rent. We had another argument after I reminded him what I said earlier this week. Now I'm debating if I was right to say anything in the first place.\n\nExtra context: I can't drive myself, I need a parent or guardian in the vehicle, and my extended family is either crazy, lives out of town, or doesn't have room for me.

As long as you have access to the shared kitchen and bathroom, you can be considered a boarder. You don't need to have a private kitchen for rent to be legal. You may have a point if they don't have you in a legal bedroom, but they could get over that by just putting a bed in any other legal bedroom and saying you're renting that with access to the shared space and it's not up to them if you crash in the basement or the bedroom they consider technically yours.", ">Edit: Here is the list of chores I've been doing for years: laundry, cooking, cleaning, and I take care of the exterior of the house.

You're clearly not smart enough to understand what it means to be independent. And why the heck did you have \"plans not to work a summer job\"? You're so lazy. Get off your ass and get a second job. You're selfish and wrong to expect your parents to support you financially when you're an adult and you're blowing tons of money on freaking video games.

They aren\u2019t being unreasonable in asking their adult child who is living there to contribute to the expenses of, checks notes, *living there.* I feel like you are opening up a can of worms threatening them with NY law and pretending like you\u2019re a tenant, not their child still living in their home. You could potentially damage your relationship with them. They have every right to ask for a financial contribution, despite the fact that you\u2019re not a traditional tenant with a lease. Nothing about their request seems unreasonable to me, sorry. A bunch of people I know lived at home with the parents after college (hell, some still do; millennial problems) and paid some form of rent, even though it\u2019s still \u201cliving at home.\u201d The fact of the matter is that they aren\u2019t children in high school anymore, they are adults with jobs who make a contribution to society.

You have a bathroom and a kitchen you just share them and if you have a room to sleep in that\u2019s a bedroom. How do you think landlords get away with shared homes? As long as everyone has their own private room (which you have) it doesn\u2019t matter if they share everything else.

You paid way more for video games than you paid your parents in rent. They are now pissed because of that (understandably), and also because your claims of being unable to work more than 12-15 hours should really say that you're unwilling. \n\nIn the comments you're talking about moving out of state, starting in the trades, etc. If you're unable to navigate paying $500 to your parents you're not going to be able to come close to doing these other things. Your behavior is all you can control, look real critically at that behavior.", "YTA. You sound like an entitled brat.

Also pretty AH to start getting litigious with your family about space. Can you do better elsewhere? If so, move out. And how ever many jobs you do around the house is completely irrelevant. Wherever you live your whole life you will have to do jobs (unless you pay someone else to).\n\nI also think the parents are kind of being AHs for demanding $500 if OP is only making $700-$800. But I do understand that they want to teach responsibility and paying your way. I just think that parents should want to support their child, so charging rent that OP can more easily pay will support them while teaching the lesson about responsibility.", "YTA. \n\nYou rely on them for your existence but can\u2019t pay $125 a week? \n\nMost people are paying $250 for a room in a share house, before food, electricity, water, comfort items, internet etc etc.", "Holy shit not only are YTA but you sound spoiled and whiny to boot too!  Newsflash buddy, basements are bedrooms for some people as long as they can be accommodated as such.  The other bathroom and kitchen don't have to be in the basement for that rule.  They can be shared communal spaces between all occupants.  The townhouse I lived in was my 1 private bedroom and shared bathroom/kitchen/living room/etc.    So unless you're telling me there's no bathroom or kitchen in that house AT ALL, then you're fine.

Grow up buddy.", "INFO: Do you buy groceries, pay electricity, water, etc.? \n\nOverall tho, YTA. \n\nThere's a lot going on in terms of why you're only making $600-800 a month, why you can't drive yourself and need a parent/guardian, and all the other services your parents are providing. \n\nNot great of them to yell, of course, but I can understand their frustration. They don't want to kick you out because you obviously **need** them to function day to day, but they also need contributions for that as you're an adult. they are hoping you feel like you want to contribute and be more responsible, but you offered 10% of $600-800. You offered less than $100 for rent and board and electricity and what else? Food, water, driving you around so gas and car maintenance, etc. too? . You're not just paying for rent, you're clearly paying for more than that. \n\nYou want to be treated like a tenant while not acting like a tenant. Go check out rent and so on elsewhere for something similar. Check how much that costs, what else you'll need to pay, what else you'll have to replace (transport, groceries, etc.). \n\nYou can negotiate, of course, but I'd be pissed if you were offering $60-80 per month and then spent $150 on games. You do not have such disposable income. Who gives a shit they were on discount? You're telling them you don't have money available, fucking lowball them like that, and then spend 2x what you offered for rent on video games? Low earners do not spend 10% of their income on rent (plus you get more than just rent). So yeah, you wanna be a responsible adult, either offer more and negotiate or move out and see how hard it really is out there. You really have no idea how good you have it like that :p\n\nYou clearly aren't capable of taking care of yourself. Or understanding exactly how much is going where. You're not paying half the mortgage. Yes, YTA for how you're behaving.", "Firstly YTA.\n\nSecondly. your demands of a bathroom and kitchen are not valid as an excuse not to pay rent. The basement has been converted into a bedroom BUT it is an ATTACHED basement. Its not a separate entity,  which means you still have unobstructed access to a kitchen/bathroom in the main house. Now if this was a unit separate from the house entirely on the property that had no bathroom/kitchen then yes you'd be right to demand said renovations. However, this is NOT the case, therefore you HAVE NO CASE. You still have full access to a bathroom and kitchen, they are not locking you away etc. \n\nAs for the rent, that' fucking cheap. 500 a month in NYC?  that is BELOW market price.  I can't get a studio for under 1200 in NJ and thats in the bad neighborhoods. Oh btw that doesn't include utilities. AT ALL. So in reality to rent a STUDIO near me its close to 2k, I also need to make 3 times the rent in income, provide income verification forms and the whole 9yrds JUST to apply. Also first and lasts month rent, a security deposit (typically a months rent) admin fees, application fees, pet deposit (plus pet rent) and thats JUST for the apartment! No lights, water, heat etc. \n\nInstead of acting like a bratty child, maybe sit down with them and negotiate a proper rent price, and get a second job. I'm serious. if you are barely making 1k a month that is NOT enough to live on, and I know a welder, that field is one of the hardest fields to make it in. Because you need to be able to follow orders, directions and the like and deal with shitty hands you WILL be given. Fair warning they won't be pretty. Welders work LONG ass hours, 10-16hr shifts depending on the contract. And if you are JUST starting the program let alone your (typically low to no paid) apprenticeship, you really are up the creek without a paddle. \n\nAs for the games. that was irresponsible. I'm all for giving oneself treats, I just did today plus a couple Christmas gifts to friends. But the difference is, I have two jobs and can pay my bills WHILE saving up for the deposits I'mma need to move the fuck out. \n\nYou also need to get your license if possible, or a bus pass, or something to rely less on your parents. They aren't your saviors anymore. time to buckle down, get another job (warehouses pay great and honestly the skills learned are worth it for life lessons and challenges) and start paying rent. I don't care about the chores, because doing laundry typically is your own same for cooking and doing dishes. You are NOT providing enough housework if they want money. \n\nTime to grow up and buckle down to get yourself where you should be.", "INFO : are you contributing in non-financial ways to the household (e.g., doing chores, taking turn to cook dinner, taking care of yard work, etc.)?", "man america is WILD. Out of school, out of the house LOL\n\nthis would never happen in my own country, we actually love our own family and wouldn't charge unless the persona is actually making viable money or is unwilling to make contribution in the houselife\n\ni'd say absolutely NTA, but you should find a middle ground with the people who raised you.

Get off your ass and find another job if needed. Grow the hell up, you're an adult.", "YTA OP.  If you aren't planning on paying your parents any type of rent, then you really need to save up and move.  Can I ask you, are your parents paying for your usage of utilities (electric, gas, water), and are they paying for groceries that you consume? You are no longer a minor child that they are obligated to pay these things for.  In today's economy, it is costing them more to care for you as an adult.  Then there's the fact that due to New York DMV's Learner Permit laws, you are relying on someone over 21 years old (parents or siblings (?)) within your household to ride with you, presumably in their car because you legally can't drive alone as of yet.  Are you contributing to their car insurance (which would go up substantially since you are under 25 years old) and is now listed in NY DMV system as a new driver which insurance companies (including your parent's insurance company) have access to?  Are you paying for their time for riding with you, then having to drive back home, then drive back to pick you up and then letting you drive their car (with them as a passenger) back home?  Are you paying for wear and tear on their vehicle(s)?\n\nNow a grown, responsible person would sit down with their parents and have a logical conversation stating that since you only earn at the most $800.00 a month, you paying them $500.00 a month does not leave you much to save to be able to some day move or purchase your own car.  Make a counter offer of $200.00 a month that will contribute towards the utilities and food that you consume.  And for whatever sake, stop purchasing big tickets items until you can either get your own place or be able to afford to pay them the $500.00 they want in rent.  Because your doing so is like you saying \"Fuck You\" to them.  And all the arguments and threats you are making to your parents can and will come back to bite you in the ass.  They can stop riding with you, thus leaving you stranded or having Uber/Lyft expenses just to get to work or they can just tell you to move.  Your choice dude, have a adult conversation and try to reach a compromise or be prepared for the worse.", "YTA. Move out now. Their house, their rules.

It seems like you've not worked before this recent job, so that is another slight point of concern, most teenagers try to earn money through part time work and then they don't have to be reliant on family. \nCan you confirm what the situation is with the welding school? Do you have the qualifications for it? Is it like an apprenticeship? On the face of it, it sounds like a worthy job and I hope you make a success of it.\nTo people complaining that you should have been working more hours or even full time as soon as you presumably left education, I'd say ignore them.  be working full time, ignore them!  \n\nMy solution to your problem would be as follows, I would propose speaking to your parents and working out some sort of deal with them, I agree that giving them well over half of what you're currently making (if it comes to $800) is pretty crazy. Is there some sort of negotiation you guys could do? Like actually working out what the percentage of \"rent\" would be, plus bills (and taxes) and maybe some money toward food? Are you able to demonstrate to them what you'd do with your salary? Like breaking down what you intend to do your monthly salary and if you're saving, what the money is going toward? You mention you're learning to drive, is the plan to get a car? That presumably will be expensive but will enable you to have a lot more freedom and independence and not be reliant on them. Alternatively when do you plan to move out?  \n\nRegarding being TA, I do think you shouldn't have bought the games, or certainly as many as you did as it comes across as both naive and entitled. I don't think throwing your interpretation of rental laws around the family is the way to go either.

These are all things you need to think about too.\nPresumably you'll need money to move out, so can't you find alternative work so you can get extra money together? It's not unreasonable to work between 30 - 40 hours minimum as an 18 year who's out of school I'm afraid. You're not a child anymore and can't rely on the prospect that you can expect more hours at some point in the future from your current job.\nI don't really understand the room situation, presumably it has been converted into a bedroom? \nI do think you need to take yourself out of all this and think about your situation then sit down with your parents. \nGood luck and I look forward to an update!", "Do it and GTF out of there!

They're very grown adults, if they are too stupid to ask what he was making before agreeing to that then that's on them. It is an offer, which they chose to accept.

OP mentioned the parents agreed to 10% years ago, not recently. \n\nI would agree with you if parents were asking for an unreasonable amount.

You have no inclination to listen only fight.\nYour parents gave you a lowball number because they didn't know what you could afford.
