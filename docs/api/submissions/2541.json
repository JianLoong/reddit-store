You are excluding other family members and friends as well because of the limited number of people you want to have. And you have stated Jose is not her boyfriend anyways, so I think it\u2019s reasonable to exclude him. If she doesn\u2019t want to come because Jose isn\u2019t invited, that\u2019s on her. The codependency there is going to be rough later on if they go on like this.\n\nEdit: typo", "INFO\n\nHas Maria ever stated or hinted that Jose is her boyfriend and how does he feel about going everywhere with her?", "NTA, just be like no way Jose", "I don't understand how it would be different if he were her boyfriend. NAH", "NTA, Maria is old enough to understand that she can\u2019t dictate who people invite to an event they\u2019re organising and paying for. Is there a reason she likes to be with Jose all the time like social anxiety?", "NTA, you're being perfectly reasonable", "NTA, you can have whoever you want at your own party...but why are you having a gender reveal if money is tight?", "NAH\n\nYou can choose whom you wish to invite and an intimate event like a a gender reveal you might prefer to have with a small circle of close family members.\n\nShe might feel uncomfortable with extended family events and feel more secure with her best friend along. You don\u2018t know what\u2018s going on inside of the girl. Maybe they\u2018re really just besties that she loves to have fun with and bring everywhere or their friendship is also important support to her. So she might decide not to go to a gathering without him. \n\nReally, large gatherings, especially with family and relatives can be really scary or annoying to teenagers. I wouldn\u2018t blame her if she felt that way.", "NTA, but it sounds like Maria is very stubborn when it comes to Jose. It also sounds like Maria's family doesn't respect the kinds of boundaries that you're trying to set. Not sure what the solution is. I wish there were a way to reason with Maria, explain that all these extra people, such as Jose AND his two little sisters, really add a lot of expense to a small gathering. They sound like they don't have much money, otherwise I would recommend that you tell Maria sure, she can bring Jose, but they have to have lunch or dinner before they come to the party, because you just won't have enough food for everyone.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Don\u2019t answer every call or call back right away.

Come up with shared boundaries about telling Maria no or even hold an intervention. At the very least his little sisters shouldn\u2019t be coming to anything that\u2019s weird and unless your family events are every day or week there\u2019s no reason for them to come.

Like I get not wanting his siblings there because they have zero connection. Also how long has Maria and Jose been friends for?", "they\u2019ve been friends for like 3 years i believe. the only reason they\u2019ve gotten to dislike him is because of how maria acts when she\u2019s with him. for instance, one time both of my sil and mil went to a concert and sil 2 asked maria if she could take care of her son (11) and maria accepted since she was already going to take care of her siblings (9,8,7) and according to my nephew the 11 y.o. Maria locked them in the house and went next door to jose\u2019s house and just stayed there. we found out about this one time that we took care of our nephew and he had told us that he didn\u2019t like when maria babysat him and told us that story. there\u2019s so many more things like that that have happened so husbands family just started disliking jose. it\u2019s truly not jose\u2019s fault.", "Esh except the kids.

She doesn't have to like it, can try and backtrack, but your decision stands. I would also tell her that if she doesn't want her kids feelings hurt, she should teach her kid to respect other peoples wishes as much as she wants them to respect hers.", "we knew we didn\u2019t want jose there because it\u2019s a small intimate gathering. also for maria to start kinda getting used to some family members setting up boundaries and letting her know when she can or can\u2019t bring jose to a gathering.", "Ah okay yeah, I see it now. Must have misread it before.", ">We\u2019re hosting a small gender reveal with just our family due to money reasons.\n\nA nieces boyfriend and the boyfriends two siblings are not welcome when you're trying to host on a small budget and are already excluding family.", "he doesn\u2019t blame jose, he knows it\u2019s all maria\u2019s doing.", "maria tends to use her depression as an excuse for everything so a lot of family enables the behavior except for husband and BIL. the one who needs to put her foot down is SIL but i\u2019m sure she\u2019s scared of how it\u2019ll affect maria\u2019s mental health.", "not that he has more power, his family is bigger. he\u2019s the youngest of 5 and we only want immediate family. if i were to invite the family i want it would already be over 60 people. my house is too small for that.", "Oh I didn't mean that in a bad way lol. \n\nI completely understand why you wouldn't want him there.", "yeah, and i think that's the bigger issue. if niece just wanted to bring her best friend to everything the family would probably be more well if he was her boyfriend we'd be okay with it so fine.\n\nbut Jose comes with 2 kids to everything. and even if they say just Jose- i imagine the 2 kids still come.", "That doesn\u2019t answer my question. Jose is not her boyfriend. OP said it would be different if he was. I\u2019m wondering why she\u2019s using her husbands family as an excuse for why it would be different.", "you\u2019re good lol just explaining the reasoning to it. i also added about the quincea\u00f1era because my bil already talked to her about jose not being allowed to go and maria just brushed it off.\n\nedit: typo", "i don\u2019t really mind it, if they wanna come to the baby shower and my sil isn\u2019t going to be complaining about having to bring them then fine with me. but my bil and his wife think they shouldn\u2019t have to tolerate having them there if they\u2019re just friends. if they were bf and gf then even if they don\u2019t want the kids there, they\u2019d have to accept it since \u201che\u2019s part of the family\u201d", "I mean you- you. whatever\n\nI guess I don't see the SOs of teenagers as \"part of the family.\" I'd get it if someone had been dating someone for a long period but it sounds like your BIL is saying that if Maria started dating someone a month before her cousin's Quince, the BF would be included cuz they're \"family\" but not Maria's long time best friend who is probably more Maria's family than a short-term BF.\n\nbut again whatever works for your family. it's your family, not mine.", "It's so weird that folks are down voting you. Usually if you don't want it invite someone to something reddit would say your party your rules but now you have to invite a non family member because he is good friends with your family? That's just rude and if she can't go a day without him I guess it's her choice. Not like he is a spouse you're choosing to not invite.", "his family has a weird dynamic, when we were dating he wasn\u2019t taking to his mom and siblings as much due to a misunderstanding. by the time we were engaged he had a better relationship with his mom. we got married in the beginning of the pandemic with just our parents present and when we found out we were expecting he made amends with his siblings. i never went to a family gathering as \u201cthe girlfriend\u201d or \u201cfianc\u00e9e\u201d i started attending as his wife but they\u2019ve never made me feel out of place. i\u2019m sure my bill also wouldn\u2019t allow a bf to attend if they barely started dating.", "i think they\u2019re just mad because i said my husband would go low contact with maria. it got people PISSED.", "I would be pissed if a family member felt the need to bring a friend and his siblings to my family event. Those folks aren't my family. To the point they unfollow me on social media like that is just childish. And being young isn't really an excuse."]}
