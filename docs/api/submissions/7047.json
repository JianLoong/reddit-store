While we were in the pool, a woman came up to me and told me that I needed to stop because I was being unsafe. I told her we were fine, and she can carry on with her own activities. She said that my son might drown in the pool.\n\nI said that he could drown in a pool, a lake or the ocean, just like anyone else, but he's far less likely to because I am teaching him to swim. Since we live in a giant swamp, it's a pretty necessary skill. She went on to say that if I didn't take my son out of the pool I might trigger a panic attack in her, because she has anxiety, and she won't be able to relax until she knows my son is safe. I admit that what I said next was very harsh.\n\nI told her that if she's telling the truth, then she is more dangerous than the pool. If seeing a baby swimming can trigger a medical emergency in her, then it is irresponsible for her to be out in public. If she has an attack, and I need to administer first aid, I won't be fully able to supervise my son, and he will be less safe. I obviously exaggerated a little (I would never leave my child unattended for a stranger's medical emergency), but I was trying to make a point. I told her she was giving me anxiety about her (she wasn't) and should go home so I can feel safe.\n\nThe woman looked like she was going to cry, and I started to feel like I'd responded too harshly. She asked if I was saying people with anxiety shouldn't be able to go out in public. I walked my statement back a bit and said no, but you aren't allowed to inflict your condition on other people. We aren't going to stop living our lives because you are upset. You need to do whatever will make you feel comfortable, up to but not including asking me to stop doing what I'm doing.\n\nShe left at that point. I still had fun with my son in the pool, but I felt bad. I think I may have been too harsh. I'm really sick of society acting like it can tell women what to do just because we have a baby. I may have taken that out on someone struggling with mental illness, which is already a difficult thing to cope with. If I did, I feel terrible.

It\u2019s silly.", "Not swim like an adult or older child can swim, but you can teach them to rescue themselves if they fall in and how to be comfortable in the water and play with you, which are building blocks to the swimming skills you will teach them later. The biggest thing to teach them is to hold their breath if they are submerged in water (this can happen accidentally in a number of scenarios, some of which are harder to prevent than people think) so they don't inhale any.\n\nBlow on their face and then submerge them in the water for a second. Blowing on their face makes them hold their breath, so they won't inhale the water. Don't do this too many times in a row, because it can be stressful, but a few times in one lesson is fine. Eventually they will learn to hold their breath when their face is wet. That way, if your kid falls in some water accidentally, they won't inhale water. Even if you are a foot away from your kid, it will take a second to fish them out of the water, and inhaling water in that second would be bad for them, so it's good for them to have this skill.\n\nWith self rescue, they flip themselves over and grab the wall. Every day (on average) in America children fall in pools and drown silently without ever surfacing or being able to call out for help. By learning to flip over and grab the wall, they will be able to vocalize their distress and alert the nearest adult. Children who are able to demonstrate these skills in a controlled environment might not be able to replicate them in an emergency, so you should still never leave your child alone near a body of water. It is still much better for them to have the skill than not have the skill.", "The sooner you get them in the water, the better. Obviously you supervise them and hold them and everything, but it\u2019s good to get them used to being in water.

I know some people that do private lessons as well but I'm guessing it is more expensive. Usually when they are very little it is more about learning to turn themselves over to float in the event of an emergency than actual swimming. And many places have a parent & child class where you get in the water with them. \n\nMy parents never learned to swim & my dad was terrified of water his whole life. Even had two classmates in hs drown back in the early 60's. First thing they did when I was 4 (I'm old they didn't do swimming lessons any earlier) was get me enrolled. I get having anxiety but it is the smartest thing to give your kids the skills to be safe around water.", "Not recommended until they're about 2, as they can't really understand the skills. It can also make parents more complacent. \n\nHowever, getting in the water with your kid and teaching them some skills is not wrong. As long as you keep it up past 2 when they can actually benefit.", "Yeah there\u2019s an entire technique they use to teach infants how to get comfortable in water. The basics being they learn to float and roll over on their back to breathe. Eventually they learn to roll over and dog paddle to the edge of the pool, rolling over to breathe when they need to on the way.\n\nReally early on it\u2019s just about them learning to hold their breath and get comfortable in the water.\n\nI think it\u2019s an absolutely essential skill to teach kids, my daughter learned it too.", "My kids were swimming like little fish by the time they were 9mo old.

Now did I let them go into an actual pool without either me right there or a flotation device?  NO WAY.  However, it was a pretty stark difference between them and non-early-swimming kiddos when they hit like 4-5 and the other kids were afraid to jump off the side of a pool or get their faces in the water, meanwhile my kids were going off the diving board and easily swimming around with no floaties.  Highly recommend early water/pool exposure.", "Even then, the problem to express would be that the baby was not safe, not her anxiety about it.", "I'm pretty sure the first, but I can't read her mind.

Honestly, if you do have anxiety, you'd be  finding it difficult to actually tell a parent to parent.", "Are you saying you cussed out your grandma for asking you not to do something that was making her anxious when you were 8?", "I think they call that oppositional defiance disorder lol. I know what you mean though", "Thank you for that.  Some of these comments are so out of touch with the entire concept of 'other people'.

Little dude immediately flipped over, surfaced, and kicked to the stairs. I was standing there like !?!?! Hahaha. Definitely gave me anxiety- up until I saw that he could swim.

The AAP *does* recommend swim training starting at 1, but that doesn't mean that bringing a baby under 1 into the pool is a bad thing.  It just means that babies over 1 are more likely to accidentally toddle their way into bodies of water and need to know how to swim.", "I live in a Western European country, and we are strongly advised to get babies used to water, with some precautions of course. \"Before the age of 4 months, it is preferable not to go to the sea or to the swimming pool (risks of infection are great for the child and for the mother too, if she had a caesarean). From the age of 4 months, your baby can join a baby swimming class or go swimming in public. If it is a public pool, it is recommended to wait until 6 months because the water is generally colder than in a private pool and there is a lot of noise. Up to 6 months, your baby can \"swim\" with the help of an adult and is able to hold his breath underwater for a few seconds.\"  \nso it doesn't shock me at all that OP takes her baby to the pool, quite the opposite!"]}
