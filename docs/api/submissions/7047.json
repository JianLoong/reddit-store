She said that my son might drown in the pool.\n\nI said that he could drown in a pool, a lake or the ocean, just like anyone else, but he's far less likely to because I am teaching him to swim. Since we live in a giant swamp, it's a pretty necessary skill. She went on to say that if I didn't take my son out of the pool I might trigger a panic attack in her, because she has anxiety, and she won't be able to relax until she knows my son is safe. I admit that what I said next was very harsh.\n\nI told her that if she's telling the truth, then she is more dangerous than the pool. If seeing a baby swimming can trigger a medical emergency in her, then it is irresponsible for her to be out in public. If she has an attack, and I need to administer first aid, I won't be fully able to supervise my son, and he will be less safe. I obviously exaggerated a little (I would never leave my child unattended for a stranger's medical emergency), but I was trying to make a point. I told her she was giving me anxiety about her (she wasn't) and should go home so I can feel safe.\n\nThe woman looked like she was going to cry, and I started to feel like I'd responded too harshly. She asked if I was saying people with anxiety shouldn't be able to go out in public. I walked my statement back a bit and said no, but you aren't allowed to inflict your condition on other people. We aren't going to stop living our lives because you are upset. You need to do whatever will make you feel comfortable, up to but not including asking me to stop doing what I'm doing.\n\nShe left at that point. I still had fun with my son in the pool, but I felt bad. I think I may have been too harsh. I'm really sick of society acting like it can tell women what to do just because we have a baby. I may have taken that out on someone struggling with mental illness, which is already a difficult thing to cope with. If I did, I feel terrible.
