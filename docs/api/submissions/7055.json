He wasn't a bad guy necessarily: to him, he fulfilled his obligation to raise me to an adult and wanted to cut ties and live his own life because he became a father very young. In the 25 years since he left, he's lived his dream with lots of travel.\n\nI know it shouldn't have affected me as much as it did, since I was an adult, but it devastated my mom and he promised he'd keep in touch with all of us. He never did. Since then, I've only spoken to him 4 or 5 times and I haven't met him. My mom has never spoken to him again. This was all on his end: we tried to no avail.\n\nWhen I had kids of my own, we didn't pretend I didn't have a dad or he passed or anything like that. I was always forthright and told my daughters that he decided not to be a dad anymore and it hurt grandma and me deeply. If my kids had any questions, I told them the truth with how it affected us, but also more menial things like how he was, who he was, and so on. My kids have a generally negative view of him and they came to their own conclusions given all the facts with no hyperbole or sugarcoating.\n\nHe emailed me to talk on the phone last week and he told me he's dying with Stage 4 lung cancer. We talked a bit about him leaving and he said he doesn't regret his decision because his life was \"taken from him\". He said he respects that I turned into a well adjusted adult and he's proud that I've got so far, even without him, but that he doesn't love me and has no intention of seeing me before he goes.\n\nHe did say, however, that he is dividing his assets between a few close friends and wanted to leave $25,000 each to both of my kids. He was a penny pincher but still lived modestly, he only ever worked to maintain, never to grow, so I don't doubt this is a large chunk of his total assets. He said it's only right that they get this money because they're his only grandchildren.\n\nI'm conflicted because accepting this money means, at least how my brain rationalizes it, that I forgive him or that it's okay or healthy to have lived how he did. I don't want my kids to get a lump sum and suddenly have a change of heart about him. I'm thinking of refusing the money on their behalf because it sets a bad example. My wife stands by my decision.\n\nBut WIBTA to my kids for taking this choice from them?

We expected him to change his will so that he would leave his new wife money so she would be taken care of, but he had always had things set up to be a trust and eventually the estate would have grown substantially by the time our kids inherited it from my husband and I (my husband is an only child).

To him, it may be that he thinks it's making up for what he did, but he openly told you he doesn't love you and doesn't regret his choice.

You actually don't have any power here, your father does not not need your permission or agreement to leave anything to your children.   If he leaves the money directly to them and as their guardian you do something that doesn't benefit them, they can sue you when they reach majority.   He can also just leave it in trust for them to claim when they are adults.   So all this posturing about your accepting his money is just that: posturing.\n\nSo what if the money might change your children's view of him?  Have you raised them to be that shallow; that after a lifetime of being told he didn't want to be a grandad, they would suddenly  have a big change of heart and idolize him?\n\nYou can't stop your dad from leaving his money to your kids.   You need to work out the best way to do that for their long-term benefit.  Some people might say it should go into education accounts but that's not necessarily the way to go.   Trust accounts invested well could be better.  If you were already planning to finance their post-secondary education, the solution might be trust accounts that will be under their control at 25.   That would leave the money out of the picture until they were beginning to establish themselves.   Tell him to see a financial planner to figure out the best way to do that.", "YWBTA. That money could end up being hugely beneficial to your kids, and I think you need to let go of this hurt you're carrying around.

But resenting him was not their own decision how you claim here, even if i understand you want to see it like this, it was highly influenced by your opinion about him and your kids seeing how hurt you are bc of him.\n\nIf you decline the offer and your kids find out, there is a big chance they will resent you bc you took away something from them to feed your own resentements. It would also not be right to ask them, they would feel like they have no option to keep it bc you will maybe love them less then. \n\nWhat you should do is take the money and if they are adults give it to them and tell them where its coming from and that they are free to use it or donate it if they don't want it.

The rationale being that, for all that he has done and what he made my birth family go through, and how much he has hurt my mother, I do not want him in my family's life. Ever.

Metaphorically speaking: it would sit quite prominently in your family's life, and is something I would much rather avoid.\n\nOn the other hand, I would consider that the gift of the sum of money to be a matter between my children and my dad.

Then, when the kids start looking at colleges, you can sit them down and tell them there is money for them, left by their grandfather when he passed 3 years ago. This will give you at least 3 years. Alternatively, if you can afford to pay for college yourselves, you could save telling them for when they graduate college or turn 25 or are looking to buy their first house or something similar, and tell them there is a fund for them then. This way, no one loses out, and you get time to deal with your (very understandable) feelings about this.\n\nBest of luck OP, warm hugs from a stranger", "IMO, refusing the money sets a bad example.
