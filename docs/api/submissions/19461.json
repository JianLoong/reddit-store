She was a single mother college educated and previously married supporting herself with no assistance in the 70s when she met my dad. He was an officer in the military. He never made her work. It doesn't require \"nerve\" it's pretty common in the world of people who can afford it and want the best for their kids. Maybe OP actually loves those kids and didn't make her work just because they weren't his biologically. \n\nMy mother joined the workforce after the birth of her third kid by accident. She found something she loved and was good at and pursued it as a career. It was flexible enough that she still had time for us kids. \n\nIt really is okay that people live differently from you. \nWhat's not okay is to set up those expectations with your spouse and then snatch them away. But that's not even what's happening here. She offered. She offered. She offered. He just doesn't like the fact she isn't offering HIS way. All she did was ask him to wait. I don't understand the need to villianize her for being a sahm", "You should be confused because I'm almost positive OP edited the post from its original statement that she was losing the allowance by going to work which makes much more sense AND supports her reasoning for wanting to receive at least one paycheck before committing fully. I will also note that OP has not responded to a single comment in this entire thread. I call bs", "Nope, look at the auto mod comment. It copies the post verbatim before people can comment on it.\n\n\n\nThey're losing some of that money because the kid aged out.", "Yup, I\u2019m with you on the bs. It\u2019s weird and none of it really adds up at all. Especially with the edits you\u2019ve mentioned.", "NTA. She is. She wants you to carry the burden of supporting the whole household while using her own money soley on herself. And shes getting child support? Thats supposed to be for the kids, food, clothes, housing, etc.", "NTA", "ESH.\n\nSorry, you don't walk into an extended blended family and just decide to \"wing it\" with the finances.", "OP said child benefit. If he is in the UK (I assume he is due to the benefits he mentioned and the reference to cost of living crisis), then child benefit is only about 20 pound a week for a first child and about 11 a week for the second child. It doesn't cover much at all.", "At least 13", "All the kids are 13+. Old enough to take care of themselves.", "I am not villanizing her for being a SAHM, I just think it sucks that she is not willing to contibute to the joint family expenses. He WAS making what sounds like enough money, but then things changed when he changed jobs and his kids had to come live with them as well. And I do not know any couples who decide that one of the parents will be a SAHP who think of that as a permanent \"expectation.\" It is usually something that is expected to be a temporary situation while the kids are small and they want to make sure a parent is home with them. So how could that be an expectation that is snatched away? \n\nAs I said, things change, and in op's situation they did change due to \"unforseen circumstances.\" His wife needs to step up and help financially. The way they are living is unsustainable.\n\nI said I can't imagine having the nerve to expect my partner to take on all of the expenses for both me and my son because that just is not what I would have been comfortable doing. I would have felt so vulnerable and dependent, and I just would not have felt safe.", "Carers allowance in the UK is a different thing to child benefit. Carers allowance is what you get if you are caring for a sick, elderly or disabled person so I would assume one of the kids has 'special needs'.", "Might be BS but it hasn\u2019t been edited. If your platform lets you, you can sort the comments by \u201cOld\u201d and see the copy the bot made.", "\ud83d\ude39", "Doesn't matter.  Unless wife can get a job that beats the crap out of minimum wage, she's going to bust her butt trying to help, without much actual income to contribute.", "Where did you see she was unwilling? For goodness sake the woman of her own volition went and found a part time job and said if was because she wanted to contribute. \n\nAnd at no point in the post does OP express and resentment or unwillingness in this arrangement so how is it that his wife \"expect s\" it. Did he not have any agency in the decision? You keep talking about nerve and maybe it's simply that nobody has every given you a real opportunity. If you didn't feel safe taking someone up on that offer then they weren't the person for you. You know what would make you safe in that situation? Having your own funds like OP wife has. \n\nImagine making chump change compared to your partner and then demanding you \"help\" and if it all does go to shit, you haven't saved any money to cover yourself because you've been \"contributing \" but they make more than enough to take care of themselves and your kids while you are out in your ass with barely enough to put a roof over your head IF that. How does \"contributing\" make you safer in that instance. \n\nLike I said AND like OP said she did step up. She got the job. the only thing she DIDN'T do was give her direct deposit the joint account instead of her personal account. So what is everyone's problem with her?\n\nEdit:  and it could be snatched away because if they never talked about it, then it wasn't on the table. Glad your peeps had that convo. Some never do because it's not in the cards for them. It's not all about the kids ages.", "I had been looking where the original would be. Thank you for correcting me.", "Found that out a short while ago. Don't know where I got those thoughts from early this morning", "On a side note, apparently it\u2019s the official Reddit mobile app that won\u2019t let you. Just a minor one of the many reasons people resorted to third parties to get a better experience.", "Do you think sahms do nothing while kids are in school?  There is still housework, grocery shopping, errands, and meals to take care of.  While I was a sahm, I took care of all service needed for our home and cars.  While I certainly had down time, I was busy most days.  Op is in this position because he chose to take a \u201cdream\u201c job that cut his pay drastically.  And now that his income no longer affords their lifestyle, he expects his wife to go back to work with no thanks or regard for her contributions to the family."]}
