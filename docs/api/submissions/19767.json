This has been a long standing tradition. As they got older, they began expressing interest in having guests join us so our father and I implemented a rule that unless you're engaged or married to this person, they aren't allowed to tag along. This rule was implemented while G and H were still in middle and high school. We hated being the boring parents, but it saved us from having to look after someone else's child while on vacation.\n\nThis was never a real hard and fast rule, of course. It was something we said at a time when neither of our children would realistically be getting engaged. Now that they're both over 18, it was kind of silently shifted to any serious romantic partner could join us. We've never brought this up, however, because it hasn't been relevant. We have been introduced to some of H's partners, but none of them have been around for longer than a year. G has never introduced us to anyone.\n\nLast year, my son approached me and asked if his best friend, R (24M), could join us for vacation that year. This was a long time friend of his, one that my husband and I could basically consider a second son at this point. He has stayed over with us more times than I could ever possible keep track of and in the past we had considered allowing him to come along when he and my son were still minors but decided against it as we knew H would also want to bring a friend, and didn't have one we knew well enough to allow. This conversation was a lighthearted one where my son said he knew they weren't engaged, but he was committed to spending his life with R. We agreed he could come, and last year's vacation was a lot of fun despite H's protests.\n\nThis year, things have been contentious. H recently revealed that she's pregnant when we didn't even know she was seeing anyone. We met this man once after this revelation, and during this time we got news that they're now engaged. They have seemingly been together for four months and she's been pregnant for three of those. She asked if he could come on vacation with us this year and we said no.\n\nShe argued that this wasn't fair as R is coming again and he and my son aren't engaged. I explained what I did here about how that rule doesn't really apply anymore, but she wasn't having it. She said we're playing favorites and it wasn't fair, but we've known R since he was young and know nothing about this man.\n\nI would like outside opinions. AITA?\n\nEdit: My husband and I pay for plane tickets, accommodations, and most meals. Any extras (souvenirs, extra experiences, etc.) are covered by the kids and their guests who want them.\n\nEdit: For the lovely AmITheDevil commenters, I have openly acknowledged in the comments of this post that G might be part of the LGBT+ community. I'm not ignoring it, it's just not relevant to our support of him or R's inclusion. Whether or not they are both simply uninterested in relationships and have a platonic bond or they're in a relationship, he is part of our family regardless.

As a parent myself, this would set off all kinds of red flags and I\u2019d let him go on the trip so I could get to know him better and sus out the real situation without alienating my daughter.  This guy could be good for her and their relationship just happened to start out in a big way, or she\u2019s getting herself into a  pretty deep situation.  Either way, she needs you there for her, and money < your relationship with your daughter. How about inviting them over more?  Kill them with kindness. \n  \nYour son met the spirit of the rule and your daughter met the letter.  I get why you want to say no and that your money is yours to do with as you please, but I think you\u2019re being pretty short-sighted here considering what is potentially at risk.", "Yes, YTA. You've moved the goalposts without warning.\n\n It's really hard for you to deny that Helen has a romantic partner when she's pregnant and has introduced her partner to you.

If you had particular reasons for disliking your daughter\u2018s fianc\u00e9, I could understand it, but you haven\u2019t given us (or the sounds of it, your daughter) any rationale beyond an arbitrary decision.

Heck, you let the favorite bring his friend, directly breaking the rule you originally set up.\n\nAnd if you like it or not, that 'stranger' you're refusing to allow come with y'all is most likely going to be around for quite a while.

This rule was made up for a reason, and it seems the rule has become more important than the reason the rule was made for in the first place to a lot of people.\n\nIf R is a very good friend and you know him for years and see him as your second son, I understand you feel more comfortable bringing him than bringing along a guy you didn't know a couple months ago and recently got your daughter pregnant and got engaged to her. They might be engaged, but still. She only knows him for a couple of months. You know him for even less time than that. \n\nAgain, I really am a person who likes to stick to rules.

H has made very very little effort to introduce him to her family. He can not just hop on board like this.

This has been a long standing tradition. As they got older, they began expressing interest in having guests join us so our father and I implemented a rule that unless you're engaged or married to this person, they aren't allowed to tag along. This rule was implemented while G and H were still in middle and high school. We hated being the boring parents, but it saved us from having to look after someone else's child while on vacation. \r  \n\r  \nThis was never a real hard and fast rule, of course. It was something we said at a time when neither of our children would realistically be getting engaged. Now that they're both over 18, it was kind of silently shifted to any serious romantic partner could join us. We've never brought this up, however, because it hasn't been relevant. We have been introduced to some of H's partners, but none of them have been around for longer than a year. G has never introduced us to anyone.\r  \n\r  \nLast year, my son approached me and asked if his best friend, R (24M), could join us for vacation that year. This was a long time friend of his, one that my husband and I could basically consider a second son at this point. He has stayed over with us more times than I could ever possible keep track of and in the past we had considered allowing him to come along when he and my son were still minors but decided against it as we knew H would also want to bring a friend, and didn't have one we knew well enough to allow. This conversation was a lighthearted one where my son said he knew they weren't engaged, but he was committed to spending his life with R. We agreed he could come, and last year's vacation was a lot of fun despite H's protests.\r  \n\r  \nThis year, things have been contentious. H recently revealed that she's pregnant when we didn't even know she was seeing anyone. We met this man once after this revelation, and during this time we got news that they're now engaged. They have seemingly been together for four months and she's been pregnant for three of those. She asked if he could come on vacation with us this year and we said no.\r  \n\r  \nShe argued that this wasn't fair as R is coming again and he and my son aren't engaged. I explained what I did here about how that rule doesn't really apply anymore, but she wasn't having it. She said we're playing favorites and it wasn't fair, but we've known R since he was young and know nothing about this man.\r  \n\r  \nI would like outside opinions. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You are playing favorites, that\u2019s exactly what you\u2019re doing so she\u2019s not wrong. You think this is going to be a fun trip when your pregnant daughter is going to be alone because y\u2019all changed your minds? She will be vocal about this the whole trip so be prepared for that. It\u2019s an asshole move but you\u2019re paying so it\u2019s your decision. Personally, if my parents pulled this shit on me, I wouldn\u2019t go. And I\u2019d be throwing up some distance between us in the future now that they\u2019ve shown how they really feel. Best of luck on this family trip with your sons friend.", "I would honestly implement the rule that they are adults.\nAll future vacations will be paid by them. If not not that grandkids are starting to pop up this could start to become very expensive.", "Soft YTA. I don't disagree with your decision to include R but not H's fiance, because you don't know him. \n\nWhere you messed up is that you did not clearly articulate your real requirement - you don't even care if they are romantic partners. The requirements you actually have, based on your post, are -\n1. Over 18\n2. Someone you know and like\n3. Each kid gets a maximum of 1 guest\n\nThis is all quite reasonable, and you should have stated it up front instead of playing around with \"no ring no bring.\" \n\nIf you had done this, your daughter would know that the way to get her fiance included is by introducing you to him, and facilitating you getting to know him. But she didn't know this, you told her all she needed was a ring, so she went and got it. \n\nHowever, hindsight is 20/20, and since this has already played out, if I were you, I would let the bf come on the vacation, despite my reservations. If he's planning to marry your daughter, you should try to get to know him now, instead of alienating him before they even get married.", "YTA \nNot sure what the big deal is letting him into your vacation. He's already been in your daughter. \n\nIn all seriousness you have obvious favoritism for the boys", "YTA WTF. You changed the rule, and then didn't even bother honoring the old one.

If you are going to change them, change them for everybody, not just your favorite child.\n\nMore than likely, next year your daughter won't go on vacation because she will have a newborn.  **Take this vacation to get to know the guy that is your grandchild's dad**.  What better way to get to know somebody than to take them on vacation?  If he is a slob and a total mooch, well, now you know and you can help your daughter see that.  Or maybe you find out that he is a really great guy and you enjoy spending time with him.\n\nOr you can exclude him, and create a wedge between you and your daughter.  Who knows, maybe that's what you are trying to do.", "I'm gonna say YTA, but not for not bringing this strange man on vacation. You were already the asshole for making fake rules, lying to your kids, and not communicating well about who you were willing to bring on these vacations. You created a confusing set of qualifications, changed them with no notice, and then, after it had already created conflict, said that the rules you had set were never real in the first place. Of course she's pissed! \n\nI don't blame you for wanting to have met this guy before committing to a vacation with him, which is why you should have set *real* rules about who can come based on your *real* expectations and limitations.", "Yta. You stated the rule and aren\u2019t following it for either of them. Your exact words were engaged or married. Your son is neither of those and you bend the rule for him, but your daughter is engaged and pregnant, that means fianc\u00e9 gets to go on vacation.", "YTA.

Plus, if you don\u2019t know the fiancee well, wouldn\u2019t this be a good chance to start bonding?\n\nHe is going to be the father of your grandkid regardless. Isn\u2019t it better to spend some time getting to know him better? \n\nEven if they don\u2019t get married or get divorce, he will forever be the father of your grandkid.

You can't put any effort into getting to know him before y'all leave? \n\n>we knew H would also want to bring a friend, and didn't have one we knew well enough to allow\n\nSince it sounds like y'all don't care to know her friends, don't want to know her fianc\u00e9, I'm sure it won't be long before she decides that you can't know her child.", "YTA. I get not being super comfortable but you can't just inconsistently hold rules like this. You can't just change what the rule is as you'd like.", "NTA. Your kids are adults now so the childhood rules are out the window. It's your money and your family \u2014 who you choose to take on family vacation is strictly up to you. Period.\n\nAs for your specific situation, I think your choices make perfect sense. Your son's friend is already a de facto family member and has demonstrated his ability to add value to your family vacations. Your daughter's brand new boyfriend is a question mark. \nI know I certainly don't want to spend my vacation with someone I barely know and might not like. Sure, it might be a good opportunity to get to know him, but it could also end up a disaster. There's also the issue of setting a dangerous precedent. Do you really want to give this guy the impression that you're Mr. & Mrs. Money Bags (even if you are) and that you're happy to pay his way without him ever demonstrating his worthiness as a partner to your daughter or as even a friend of your family? I think that deserves some thought.", "NTA, the baby daddy can come if he pays.", "NTA, I always just lurk here but your daughter is making 2 back to back terrible decisions and someone needs to wake her up from her daydream sooner rather than later:\n\n1. Having a child with someone she\u2019s only known for a few months. Sure, it\u2019s nice to hope this will work out but all of us know the chances of that happening are slim. Whether they end up getting divorced or just tolerating each other for decades to \u201ckeep the family together\u201d, their kid will most likely be the one who suffers most as a result. \n\n2. Getting married specifically because you\u2019re pregnant. OP is your family particularly religious? Nothing about religion was mentioned which leads me to believe you are not but getting engaged because of a pregnancy is just plain stupid unless you genuinely believe it\u2019s a sin.  The cost of a divorce is huge.\n\nThe fact that H didn\u2019t even tell you she was seeing anyone until she was pregnant tells me the only reason she told you was the pregnancy itself, not the fact the relationship is great or that her fianc\u00e9 means a lot to her.\n\nAND you\u2019re not even saying she can\u2019t go on the family trip you\u2019re only saying Cap\u2019n Cumshot can\u2019t tag along.\n\n26 is far too old to be acting this naive and entitled.

That being said, this could be a great opportunity to get to know the guy. As far as playing favorites goes, to me that\u2019s a non-starter.

The end.", "Null. \n\nYou moved the goal posts one to many times for various reasons and I assume that kids were not involved in the discussion, even when they were young adults. \n\nSince you made an on the fly exception to the rule again I assume without involving the entire family and did not extend another exception, you created an imbalance within the family. That in turn lead to resentment. \n\nBest solution is to hold a family meeting and discuss the situation and come to an understanding about what to do next. \n\nBest of luck to you and the restoration of peace in your family.", "I can see how awkward it would be to go on vacation with someone you don't know well, but you need to step back and understand the real issue - you can be right, or you can torpedo the future relationship with your daughter, son in law, and their child/ren.  \n\nYou should suck it up this year, roll the dice even though you REALLY are obvious in how you don't respect or approve of your daughter's situation and choices.  \n\nYou will pay for this for far longer than this vacation, so if you can afford it, just invite him.  If this doesn't end up lasting, it's just one vacation out of many.  If it does, you want to get on the right footing for a strong long term relationship with your daughter's family that doesn't involve resentment and low contact in the future.\n\nOh, and apologize to your daughter for the obvious favoritism and judginess.

However being an asshole is okay sometimes, You dont want to spend your time on vacation with this man who you barely know, you dont know how that could possibly go, And you have known your sons friend for a long time and know you would get along fine. It makes sense. Its not like your ruining anones life or anything lol, You simply dont want to pay for someone to go on your holiday without knowing how it will go with them coming along.

It would just be nice if at least one person attending knew this man for more than half a year before we spend money on flights and accommodations, allow him on tabs, etc. We would of course like to get to know him better ourselves, but it's most important that our daughter knows him well enough to vouch for his character.", "Would you seriously want your 2nd time meeting someone be on trip?

She seems to take a blind eye and not really seeing what is going on.  Everyone is right.   The daughter's fiance is going to be in their lives for a very long time.  She sees only what she wants to see.  Good luck having relationships with your kids in the future.  I am sure she will explode when she finds out her son's sexual orientation and wreak more havac in the family.", "It sounds like they're platonic, and the son made a joking comment about 'commitment' (to their friendship) in order to see if that would be enough to get him accepted on the vacation.", "R is someone we all know and trust. He and our son have lived together for the past four years, and have been friends for much longer than that. I don't know the intimate details, but I do know there is genuine commitment between them. Whether that is purely platonic because they're two people who don't have any interest in romantic relationships or it's something more that they're just not ready to share, I don't know. Either way, R is a part of our family. (This extends beyond just him to his family also, who we all know well.)\n\nWith our daughter, we're nervous about the fact that she doesn't know him well. If circumstances were different - let's say our daughter lived out of the country, met someone she loved and was with him for a year but we had never met him - I would be okay with him joining us. But four months, in the grand scheme of life, is such a short amount of time to know someone and their flaws. \n\nI can only recall one fallout that we had to mediate (between R and H, actually) but that's the only time we've ever seen R's \"bad side,\" and it was a silly teenage argument. Our daughter's fianc\u00e9 might be kindest person on earth, but how many times has a surprise pregnancy such as this one led to someone's life being entwined with a person someone wishes they never would have associated with in the first place?

Your daughter chooses not to go on the vacation, which sets the stage for her not coming to other family events and slowly exiting your lives, straining your relationship with both her and with your future grandchild. \n\nScenario 4) You tell your daugther, who is already clearly not feeling very comfortable sharing her personal life with you, that you don't want him to come, and she obliges and comes on vacation and leaves her partner alone.

It's totally valid to not want pay for someone you don't even know, in actuality, you're not obligated to pay for anyone but yourself. Anything beyond that is courtesy.

Tell them you'll be covering the accommodations and suppers, but the rest is on them (flight, and extras on location).\n\nHOWEVER, there seems to be other issues at stake here. No one is obligated to inform anyone about developments in their personal lives, but your daughter hopes to have you OFFER to pay for the fiance's flight and such, YOUR DAUGHTER AND HER FIANCE should put in the effort to build that relationship with you first.

My parents are doing decently well for themselves. I WOULDN'T EVEN THINK of expecting my parents to pay for my flight on a vacation anywhere, whether it's a province away, a country away, or let alone a whole continent away. It's not an ego thing, but the fact that my parents have already done so much for my sister and I. If anything, WE should be offering to cover things like the accommodation or paying for the suppers. It'd be quite a conversational battle before giving in and letting my parents pay for a flight.\n\nTo say there is favouritism is just childish and lack of greater understanding. You've offered to pay for the flights of both your children. You also offered to pay for the flight or someone you've known for a long time, who is essentially a family friend.

The only person to feel jealous would be the random practically unknown fiance.\n\nThe daughter needs to grow the fuck up as she's about to be a mom, and if she wants this random baby daddy to be part of the picture, then get him in the goddam picture.

As you noted, H did take issue was this last year but you didn\u2019t discuss the changing rules, and instead assumed she knew.\n\nSecondly, H is about to have a child with this person, you need to accept that and attempt to welcome him into the family.

We are happily married 6 years later, with two beautiful girls absolutely adore their grandparents. I will assure if their initial response had been rejection, like yours, they would not have the same relationship with their grandchildren. Or me. The big picture is more important here.", "YTA. Your original rule was ENGAGED or married. They\u2019re engaged. If that rule no longer applies then by what rule are you working?

He is likely to be a part of your lives in one way or another for the remainder of your years. What better way to welcome him, get to know him and give him a chance, than to include him with a fun family vacation!?\n\nYou may not like your daughter's decisions, but you do have to live with them.

Play this right", "Yta\u2026 don\u2019t be surprised if this decision alienates you from your daughter. How will you feel when she excludes you from her wedding, how will you feel when she excludes you from the birth of your grand baby. Since you are drawing a clear line In the sand of your disdain for her relationship situation you should be prepared for the LONG a term damage to your relationship and consequences it will bring.  At this point in your daughters mind it most likely is not about the vacation any more just your blatant  disrespect and disregard for her life choices.\n\nBest of luck on your future relationship", "YTA.

You\u2019re isolating your daughter, you\u2019re essentially telling her that you don\u2019t trust her and that your son is the clear golden child. Like many other posters have said, you\u2019re changing the rules too late in the game. The way you write about G and R versus your own daughter is very telling. It seems as if you put not just your son but his relationships on a higher pedestal than anything compared to your daughter/ her relationships. You give more regard to your son, then your daughter. Saying things such as  \u2018despite H\u2019s protest, seemingly been together, this man\u2019 \u2014 you didn\u2019t even humanize her fianc\u00e9.

Maybe this is why she is distant in the first place.", "Yes, YTA. Of course you are. So far you've changed the rules TWICE, both times slighting your daughter. You do come across as favoring your son and seemingly punishing your daughter, even though her partner meets the criteria for your original rules.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo your daughter won't come.", "YTA\n\nThis rule is far more suited to minors than to adults.

I was the least loved child and it sucks. Big time.", "YTA, the rule was if they were engaged they could bring their partner. I guess after they are married then you would change the rule again where she has to be married for multiple years.", "I think yes, YTA. You should include the fianc\u00e9. He\u2019s going to be a member of your family, and he\u2019s your daughter\u2019s choice.

I wouldn\u2019t want to spend my vacation (especially one where I\u2019m paying for everyone to be there) with some dude that no one in my family has known for even six months.

OP doesn't know this guy, bringing them on a family vacation is a big ask and not really the best way to get to know them, in my opinion.  They've known R for years, they're comfortable with him. This guy they've met once after finding out their daughter was pregnant and engaged, and they didn't even know she was dating anyone, how ate they supposed to be comfortable sharing accommodations and paying this guy's way?\n\n\nPersonally, in addition to the red flags of knocking up their daughter and getting engaged without even having met her parents, I feel it is another red flag that he hasn't offered to pay his own way with this vacation.  That seems to me like the appropriate, polite thing to do if you are taking a trip with someone, especially someone you don't know well.", "But there is no evidence that this time frame is real. The OP specifically states \"seemingly\" been together for 4mths. \nFor all we know they were friends for ages before hooking up.\n\nFrom the sounds of it this daughter is simply in low contact with her parents. Likely because there is a golden child situation happening.", "Ok, but is OP ok with H just not going?

Your children are adults.  And you're still treating H like a child. \n\nIf what she says is actually true, she is pregnant and engaged now, congratulations! \n\nWhat better way to get acquainted with your future grandbaby's daddy by having him along for the trip? \n\nYou will alienate your daughter and she'll probably end up keeping her kid from you.", "YTA.

You, for all intents and purposes, are ruining and jeopardizing the relationship with a grandchild who isn't even born yet and a future relationship with your son in law because you've decided to ruin the opportunity to know him versus being honestly stubborn in your position. \n\nMy honest and mature response is (1)stop being am asshole, (2) talk to your daughter and simply say \"I refused because initially I didn't know him well and you have to understand I felt disrespected that you couldn't come to me and have a heart to heart talk, (3)invite the man and use it to get to know him and observe him and (4) let your daughter know you'd be honored to have him come along as long as you can also use it to get to know him because you'd really want to know your future son in law. \n\nThere very simple and you honestly managed to FUDGE IT UP! Stop being so egotistical and simply see it from the most objective standpoint possible: he WILL  be family, why start on the wrong foot? Because he \"isn't\" yet? Well your grandchild isn't born yet so guess what, you WILL also ruin that relationship by standing so firm on such an idiotic position for reasons I explained above. \n\nBut hey, people have died on hills far worse so I hope you take it to heart but if not, don't be surprised if it dies come back to bite you.\n\nEdited: typos because of autocorrect.", "YTA 1000x over.", "This is one of those spirit vs letter of the law kind of things.

Not saying it's not a minefield of complicated feelings, but Ive had several FWBs in my life that I felt nothing romantic towards. I would call them friends / platonic relationships, with sex involved. \n\nGoogle says: \n\n> A platonic relationship is\u00a0one with no romantic or sexual features\n\nBut also, somewhat condtradictorily: \n\n> A platonic relationship can involve intimacy, such as sex and cuddling, if romantic feelings (aka passion) are not involved.\n\nThis suggests that it is all quite nuanced and depends on who you ask, but in my experience the term is primarily used to mean the opposite of romantic.", "For someone they *already had a long term relationship with*.
