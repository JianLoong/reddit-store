This has been a long standing tradition. As they got older, they began expressing interest in having guests join us so our father and I implemented a rule that unless you're engaged or married to this person, they aren't allowed to tag along. This rule was implemented while G and H were still in middle and high school. We hated being the boring parents, but it saved us from having to look after someone else's child while on vacation.\n\nThis was never a real hard and fast rule, of course. It was something we said at a time when neither of our children would realistically be getting engaged. Now that they're both over 18, it was kind of silently shifted to any serious romantic partner could join us. We've never brought this up, however, because it hasn't been relevant. We have been introduced to some of H's partners, but none of them have been around for longer than a year. G has never introduced us to anyone.\n\nLast year, my son approached me and asked if his best friend, R (24M), could join us for vacation that year. This was a long time friend of his, one that my husband and I could basically consider a second son at this point. He has stayed over with us more times than I could ever possible keep track of and in the past we had considered allowing him to come along when he and my son were still minors but decided against it as we knew H would also want to bring a friend, and didn't have one we knew well enough to allow. This conversation was a lighthearted one where my son said he knew they weren't engaged, but he was committed to spending his life with R. We agreed he could come, and last year's vacation was a lot of fun despite H's protests.\n\nThis year, things have been contentious. H recently revealed that she's pregnant when we didn't even know she was seeing anyone. We met this man once after this revelation, and during this time we got news that they're now engaged. They have seemingly been together for four months and she's been pregnant for three of those. She asked if he could come on vacation with us this year and we said no.\n\nShe argued that this wasn't fair as R is coming again and he and my son aren't engaged. I explained what I did here about how that rule doesn't really apply anymore, but she wasn't having it. She said we're playing favorites and it wasn't fair, but we've known R since he was young and know nothing about this man.\n\nI would like outside opinions. AITA?\n\nEdit: My husband and I pay for plane tickets, accommodations, and most meals. Any extras (souvenirs, extra experiences, etc.) are covered by the kids and their guests who want them.", "created_utc": 1686855946, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14aae1l/aita_for_playing_favorites_by_paying_for_my_sons/", "score": 174, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As a parent myself, this would set off all kinds of red flags and I\u2019d let him go on the trip so I could get to know him better and sus out the real situation without alienating my daughter.  This guy could be good for her and their relationship just happened to start out in a big way, or she\u2019s getting herself into a  pretty deep situation.  Either way, she needs you there for her, and money < your relationship with your daughter. How about inviting them over more?  Kill them with kindness. \n  \nYour son met the spirit of the rule and your daughter met the letter.  I get why you want to say no and that your money is yours to do with as you please, but I think you\u2019re being pretty short-sighted here considering what is potentially at risk.", "Yes, YTA. You've moved the goalposts without warning.\n\n It's really hard for you to deny that Helen has a romantic partner when she's pregnant and has introduced her partner to you.

If you had particular reasons for disliking your daughter\u2018s fianc\u00e9, I could understand it, but you haven\u2019t given us (or the sounds of it, your daughter) any rationale beyond an arbitrary decision.

Heck, you let the favorite bring his friend, directly breaking the rule you originally set up.\n\nAnd if you like it or not, that 'stranger' you're refusing to allow come with y'all is most likely going to be around for quite a while.

They might be engaged, but still. She only knows him for a couple of months. You know him for even less time than that. \n\nAgain, I really am a person who likes to stick to rules. But we must also remember the reasons why those rules were made in the first place and that things can change over time. Do what makes you feel comfortable.

They are together four months. It\u2019s very likely that they will be in court battling over custody right within two years. Op does not know this man. H has made very very little effort to introduce him to her family. He can not just hop on board like this.

There\u2019s a big difference between a lifelong friend and a bang buddy that knocked up your daughter. She barely knows this guy.

This has been a long standing tradition. As they got older, they began expressing interest in having guests join us so our father and I implemented a rule that unless you're engaged or married to this person, they aren't allowed to tag along. This rule was implemented while G and H were still in middle and high school. We hated being the boring parents, but it saved us from having to look after someone else's child while on vacation. \r  \n\r  \nThis was never a real hard and fast rule, of course. It was something we said at a time when neither of our children would realistically be getting engaged. Now that they're both over 18, it was kind of silently shifted to any serious romantic partner could join us. We've never brought this up, however, because it hasn't been relevant. We have been introduced to some of H's partners, but none of them have been around for longer than a year. G has never introduced us to anyone.\r  \n\r  \nLast year, my son approached me and asked if his best friend, R (24M), could join us for vacation that year. This was a long time friend of his, one that my husband and I could basically consider a second son at this point. He has stayed over with us more times than I could ever possible keep track of and in the past we had considered allowing him to come along when he and my son were still minors but decided against it as we knew H would also want to bring a friend, and didn't have one we knew well enough to allow. This conversation was a lighthearted one where my son said he knew they weren't engaged, but he was committed to spending his life with R. We agreed he could come, and last year's vacation was a lot of fun despite H's protests.\r  \n\r  \nThis year, things have been contentious. H recently revealed that she's pregnant when we didn't even know she was seeing anyone. We met this man once after this revelation, and during this time we got news that they're now engaged. They have seemingly been together for four months and she's been pregnant for three of those. She asked if he could come on vacation with us this year and we said no.\r  \n\r  \nShe argued that this wasn't fair as R is coming again and he and my son aren't engaged. I explained what I did here about how that rule doesn't really apply anymore, but she wasn't having it. She said we're playing favorites and it wasn't fair, but we've known R since he was young and know nothing about this man.\r  \n\r  \nI would like outside opinions. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "I mean. You are playing favorites, that\u2019s exactly what you\u2019re doing so she\u2019s not wrong. You think this is going to be a fun trip when your pregnant daughter is going to be alone because y\u2019all changed your minds? She will be vocal about this the whole trip so be prepared for that. It\u2019s an asshole move but you\u2019re paying so it\u2019s your decision. Personally, if my parents pulled this shit on me, I wouldn\u2019t go. And I\u2019d be throwing up some distance between us in the future now that they\u2019ve shown how they really feel. Best of luck on this family trip with your sons friend.", "I would honestly implement the rule that they are adults.\nAll future vacations will be paid by them. If not not that grandkids are starting to pop up this could start to become very expensive.", "Soft YTA. I don't disagree with your decision to include R but not H's fiance, because you don't know him. \n\nWhere you messed up is that you did not clearly articulate your real requirement - you don't even care if they are romantic partners. The requirements you actually have, based on your post, are -\n1. Over 18\n2. Someone you know and like\n3. Each kid gets a maximum of 1 guest\n\nThis is all quite reasonable, and you should have stated it up front instead of playing around with \"no ring no bring.\" \n\nIf you had done this, your daughter would know that the way to get her fiance included is by introducing you to him, and facilitating you getting to know him. But she didn't know this, you told her all she needed was a ring, so she went and got it. \n\nHowever, hindsight is 20/20, and since this has already played out, if I were you, I would let the bf come on the vacation, despite my reservations. If he's planning to marry your daughter, you should try to get to know him now, instead of alienating him before they even get married.", "YTA \nNot sure what the big deal is letting him into your vacation. He's already been in your daughter. \n\nIn all seriousness you have obvious favoritism for the boys", "YTA WTF. You changed the rule, and then didn't even bother honoring the old one. You don't like her fiance, I get it. Now everybody else gets it, too.", "NTA. they are the adults. and you make the rules. cause you paying. if she feels so entitled to have fiance go. maybe she should pay. step up or shut up.", "YTA. Story time: My Dh and I dated for only 2 weeks before he proposed and we became engaged. I was pregnant with our oldest daughter 10 months after we got together. Now we\u2019ve been together for over 23 years with 3 kids and thank goodness my family and friends welcomed him with open arms and accepted him from day 1.", "YTA - I think all the other AH votes Simms it up nicely, so all I\u2019ll say is don\u2019t be surprised or upset if H decides to show her resentment for your petty rules by implementing rules of her own for her baby in regards to your grandma visits.", "YTA & I can see why you have no clue as to what\u2019s going on in your daughter\u2019s life. Expect to be left out more and more as you do stuff like this.", "Why don\u2019t you invite him to stay for the weekend, you\u2019ll get to know him better and then feel more comfortable with him coming or it\u2019ll be really uncomfortable and obvious to everyone that the vacation won\u2019t work.

It doesn't matter that you don't know this guy like you know your son's friend, but that wasn't a part of the original agreement.  It seems like... well, it doesn't even seem like, it actually happened, that you changed to rules to benefit your son, and now you are changing the rules again to benefit you.\n\nIf you are going to set rules, set rules.  If you are going to change them, change them for everybody, not just your favorite child.\n\nMore than likely, next year your daughter won't go on vacation because she will have a newborn.  **Take this vacation to get to know the guy that is your grandchild's dad**.  What better way to get to know somebody than to take them on vacation?  If he is a slob and a total mooch, well, now you know and you can help your daughter see that.  Or maybe you find out that he is a really great guy and you enjoy spending time with him.\n\nOr you can exclude him, and create a wedge between you and your daughter.  Who knows, maybe that's what you are trying to do.", "I'm gonna say YTA, but not for not bringing this strange man on vacation. You were already the asshole for making fake rules, lying to your kids, and not communicating well about who you were willing to bring on these vacations. You created a confusing set of qualifications, changed them with no notice, and then, after it had already created conflict, said that the rules you had set were never real in the first place. Of course she's pissed! \n\nI don't blame you for wanting to have met this guy before committing to a vacation with him, which is why you should have set *real* rules about who can come based on your *real* expectations and limitations.", "Yta. You stated the rule and aren\u2019t following it for either of them. Your exact words were engaged or married. Your son is neither of those and you bend the rule for him, but your daughter is engaged and pregnant, that means fianc\u00e9 gets to go on vacation.", "YTA. Get to know your future granchilds father.", "YTA Do you even love your daughter?! What you did last year was bad enough!!!! This year you're just beyond unreasonable!!!!\ud83e\udd22", "Yes, YTA. You are playing favorites. You had a rule for a long time, changed it to fit your son\u2019s desires, and denied your daughter who actually fit the rule.

Plus, if you don\u2019t know the fiancee well, wouldn\u2019t this be a good chance to start bonding?\n\nHe is going to be the father of your grandkid regardless. Isn\u2019t it better to spend some time getting to know him better? \n\nEven if they don\u2019t get married or get divorce, he will forever be the father of your grandkid.

This is punishment for your daughter for living her own life without your approval. Keep it up and you\u2019ll never see your grandkid.", "YTA. You're very clearly playing favorites. Your golden son can get around the rules but your daughter is actually engaged. Is the vacation tomorrow morning? You can't put any effort into getting to know him before y'all leave? \n\n>we knew H would also want to bring a friend, and didn't have one we knew well enough to allow\n\nSince it sounds like y'all don't care to know her friends, don't want to know her fianc\u00e9, I'm sure it won't be long before she decides that you can't know her child.", "YTA. I get not being super comfortable but you can't just inconsistently hold rules like this. You can't just change what the rule is as you'd like.", "NTA. Your kids are adults now so the childhood rules are out the window. It's your money and your family \u2014 who you choose to take on family vacation is strictly up to you. Period.\n\nAs for your specific situation, I think your choices make perfect sense. Your son's friend is already a de facto family member and has demonstrated his ability to add value to your family vacations. Your daughter's brand new boyfriend is a question mark. \nI know I certainly don't want to spend my vacation with someone I barely know and might not like. Sure, it might be a good opportunity to get to know him, but it could also end up a disaster. There's also the issue of setting a dangerous precedent. Do you really want to give this guy the impression that you're Mr. & Mrs. Money Bags (even if you are) and that you're happy to pay his way without him ever demonstrating his worthiness as a partner to your daughter or as even a friend of your family? I think that deserves some thought.", "NTA, the baby daddy can come if he pays.", "NTA, I always just lurk here but your daughter is making 2 back to back terrible decisions and someone needs to wake her up from her daydream sooner rather than later:\n\n1. Having a child with someone she\u2019s only known for a few months. Sure, it\u2019s nice to hope this will work out but all of us know the chances of that happening are slim. Whether they end up getting divorced or just tolerating each other for decades to \u201ckeep the family together\u201d, their kid will most likely be the one who suffers most as a result. \n\n2. Getting married specifically because you\u2019re pregnant. OP is your family particularly religious? Nothing about religion was mentioned which leads me to believe you are not but getting engaged because of a pregnancy is just plain stupid unless you genuinely believe it\u2019s a sin.  The cost of a divorce is huge.\n\nThe fact that H didn\u2019t even tell you she was seeing anyone until she was pregnant tells me the only reason she told you was the pregnancy itself, not the fact the relationship is great or that her fianc\u00e9 means a lot to her.\n\nAND you\u2019re not even saying she can\u2019t go on the family trip you\u2019re only saying Cap\u2019n Cumshot can\u2019t tag along.\n\n26 is far too old to be acting this naive and entitled.

That being said, this could be a great opportunity to get to know the guy. As far as playing favorites goes, to me that\u2019s a non-starter. It\u2019s your vacation and your dime - you get to choose who you invite. The end.", "Null. \n\nYou moved the goal posts one to many times for various reasons and I assume that kids were not involved in the discussion, even when they were young adults. \n\nSince you made an on the fly exception to the rule again I assume without involving the entire family and did not extend another exception, you created an imbalance within the family. That in turn lead to resentment. \n\nBest solution is to hold a family meeting and discuss the situation and come to an understanding about what to do next. \n\nBest of luck to you and the restoration of peace in your family.", "I can see how awkward it would be to go on vacation with someone you don't know well, but you need to step back and understand the real issue - you can be right, or you can torpedo the future relationship with your daughter, son in law, and their child/ren.  \n\nYou should suck it up this year, roll the dice even though you REALLY are obvious in how you don't respect or approve of your daughter's situation and choices.  \n\nYou will pay for this for far longer than this vacation, so if you can afford it, just invite him.  If this doesn't end up lasting, it's just one vacation out of many.  If it does, you want to get on the right footing for a strong long term relationship with your daughter's family that doesn't involve resentment and low contact in the future.\n\nOh, and apologize to your daughter for the obvious favoritism and judginess.  You're already in a hole here in terms of your long term ability to be a grandparent, so you really need to grovel at this point.", "I have to be sincere: you're prioritizing the quietness of your vacation over the possibility to get to study closer (probably closer than you'll ever be in life) someone who is going to be your wife's partner and/or ex-partner/co-parent AND your grandchild father.\n\nMy compliments, I supposed to be someone who really considered vacations sacred, but I'm a crap compared to you.\n\nYTA. This is not even playing favorites, this is showing you don't care for a daughter. I really understand where your thing for vacations come from (OP, really, I wouldn't even bring the children at this point! After one year of hard work one has the right to relax) but this is a special situation and involves a girl who got pregnant and engaged SURPRISING you.

That's not fair at all.", "YTA but I agree with your decision. \n\nYou don\u2019t know this man and she didn\u2019t feel the need to let you get to know him while they were dating.\n\nEdit: sometimes you gotta be an asshole, your not a lawyer you didn\u2019t check this thing for loopholes.", "YTA, that man is going to be in your family for ever now, wether or not your they break up.

However being an asshole is okay sometimes, You dont want to spend your time on vacation with this man who you barely know, you dont know how that could possibly go, And you have known your sons friend for a long time and know you would get along fine. It makes sense. Its not like your ruining anones life or anything lol, You simply dont want to pay for someone to go on your holiday without knowing how it will go with them coming along.

He is the father of your grandchild. Getting to know him on a trip might be costly but it takes the pressure off of having to do it formally. \n\nAlso your rules were engaged or married.

They're adults now and as the person footing the bill you have every right to decide who you want to pay for and who you don't. \n\nI do understand why your daughter is miffed, but if they're so serious and her partner wants the time to bond with you, why can't he pay his own way?", "This is a really thoughtful answer. Anyone can play nice for a weekend, but a full vacation will give them real insight into who this guy is. Granted, it could ruin the vacation if he sucks, but better to ruin one vacation than their relationship with their daughter and the father of their grandkids.", "Came here to say something very similar but you said it better.\n\nYTA - See above for why.", "I actually just commented something similar to this.

Or will you move the goal posts again and say they also need to be regular visitors?\n\nI clarified for her that next year he's more than welcome to come with us. It would just be nice if at least one person attending knew this man for more than half a year before we spend money on flights and accommodations, allow him on tabs, etc. We would of course like to get to know him better ourselves, but it's most important that our daughter knows him well enough to vouch for his character.", "Would you seriously want your 2nd time meeting someone be on trip? Personally I wouldn't because I don't know them, don't know their personality.  Why risk ruining your trip?", "It's not really playing favorites because the circumstances are completely different. \n\nThis is a guy the consider their son they known for years  vs a guy they met once and their child known for 4 months. \n\nYes they're breaking their \"rule\".

It seems like OP is prioritizing a nice quiet vacation over a very rare opportunity to meet her grandchild's father. Even if they do split up later, that's not the end of his involvement.", "That is what I was thinking.  It kind of sounds like she is ignoring the fact that her son is probably gay.  She seems to take a blind eye and not really seeing what is going on.  Everyone is right.   The daughter's fiance is going to be in their lives for a very long time.  She sees only what she wants to see.  Good luck having relationships with your kids in the future.  I am sure she will explode when she finds out her son's sexual orientation and wreak more havac in the family.", "It sounds like they're platonic, and the son made a joking comment about 'commitment' (to their friendship) in order to see if that would be enough to get him accepted on the vacation.", "R is someone we all know and trust. He and our son have lived together for the past four years, and have been friends for much longer than that. I don't know the intimate details, but I do know there is genuine commitment between them. Whether that is purely platonic because they're two people who don't have any interest in romantic relationships or it's something more that they're just not ready to share, I don't know. Either way, R is a part of our family. (This extends beyond just him to his family also, who we all know well.)\n\nWith our daughter, we're nervous about the fact that she doesn't know him well. If circumstances were different - let's say our daughter lived out of the country, met someone she loved and was with him for a year but we had never met him - I would be okay with him joining us. But four months, in the grand scheme of life, is such a short amount of time to know someone and their flaws. \n\nI can only recall one fallout that we had to mediate (between R and H, actually) but that's the only time we've ever seen R's \"bad side,\" and it was a silly teenage argument. Our daughter's fianc\u00e9 might be kindest person on earth, but how many times has a surprise pregnancy such as this one led to someone's life being entwined with a person someone wishes they never would have associated with in the first place? Far too often. I would like some time to see if this is a person of sound character first.", "I mean, the son said he's committed to spending the rest of his life with his best friend.

I live in a different country than my parents so every time I brought a partner home to meet/stay/vacation with them, my partners were technically \u201cstrangers\u201d, but I don\u2019t think this term really applies to someone who\u2019s in a romantic and soon to be coparenting relationship with your child.

That means skipping the vacation, going to the hassle of bringing a baby on a long trip, or arranging for care. On a realistic basis, Helen gets locked out of vacation again.", "Like it or not, this man is the father of your grandchild. He will be in your lives in some way for a very long time.  You seem very concerned about his character... to the point where you are willing to damage your relationship with your daughter.

Like maybe on a vacation.\n\n\nBecause here is the thing, she is having a baby with this man. If she doesn't feel supported by you, she is going to have to depend on him more.

You lay the foundation of a warm, familial environment and set the tone for the relationship going forward. \n\nScenario 2) You go on a vacation and find out this guy sucks or they're a terrible couple. You've lost a weekend/week/two weeks of your lives and gotten valuable information that will help you support your daughter and grandchild.

Your daughter chooses not to go on the vacation, which sets the stage for her not coming to other family events and slowly exiting your lives, straining your relationship with both her and with your future grandchild. \n\nScenario 4) You tell your daugther, who is already clearly not feeling very comfortable sharing her personal life with you, that you don't want him to come, and she obliges and comes on vacation and leaves her partner alone.

Their original intention was not to allow \\*anyone\\* else on the trip so they created a bogus rule to make sure that doesn't happen. They created conditions in the rule that they knew the kids wouldn't meet as minors. The kids became adults and they \\*secretly\\* amended the rules in their head all the while keeping the original rule in place. \n\nAll of this is AH behavior regardless of the current situation.

I wouldn't pay for some guy I met once to go on vacation for me.  \n\nAlso, because the rule was a fianc\u00e9e but again, I doubt they think their daughter would get engaged to some guy she met 4 months ago. Like i said, if they met yesterday and got engaged, the daughter shouldn't use that \"rule\" as a way to say well he has to come because we're engaged. \n\nSo to answer no I don't think the parents are assholes.
