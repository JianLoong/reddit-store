We're set to get married in about seven months and have just started sending out invitations. From the very beginning, we agreed that we'd have a child-free wedding because we've heard too many horror stories about kids screaming during the ceremony, running around during the first dance, or just acting inappropriately in general. Because of this we've decided to make it a requirement to be age 15 or over to attend. \n\nSeth comes from a very large family (he has 6 siblings and 17 nieces and nephews), so this rule mostly applies to them. Of the 17, 9 will be under the age of 15 at the time of the wedding. Additionally, some of them are very immature and poorly behaved due to their parents constantly coddling them--they were part of the reason why Seth wanted a childfree wedding in the first place. When we told Seth's siblings about the rule, some of them weren't happy, but they accepted it.\n\nHowever, my sister completely flipped out. For context, my sister has two kids: a son (Henry) who's 16 and a stepdaughter (Valerie) who's 13. She accused me of trying to exclude Valerie from the wedding purposefully because she's not her biological child and insinuated that I didn't invite her because I don't consider Valerie my \"real family.\" Apparently, Valerie is extremely upset that Henry was invited and she wasn't, so she's been locking herself in her room and fighting with my sister and her husband about how she doesn't feel accepted in the family. I told my sister that it was nothing personal and Valerie not being invited had nothing to do with her being a stepchild and it was purely due to her age. My sister didn't listen to me and insisted that I invite Valerie, but I told her that if I made an exception for her, I'd have to make exceptions for Seth's siblings as well which would defeat the purpose of a childfree wedding. \n\nMy sister then tried to argue that in seven months, Valerie will be 14 and 5 months (which is \"basically 15\" according to her) and that she's very mature for her age and won't cause issues. I told her that I agree Valerie almost 100% won't be a problem during the ceremony/reception. However, like I said earlier, if I made an exception for her Seth's siblings would demand exceptions for their own children and we'd cause a lot of rifts in the family. \n\nMy sister finally said that I was being a heartless bridezilla who doesn't consider stepchildren as \"real children\" (even though that is absolutely not true), and that she wouldn't attend at all if Valerie couldn't. I said that it was ultimately her decision and that I'd respect it either way, but my mom is pressuring me to just let Valerie attend and to not cause a fight.

She\u2019s still 14", "NTA \n\nBut 16 and up or 18 or up seems less arbitrary than 15.  These are more milestone ages. \n\nYour sister is creating the drama and your mother is playing into it.   Valerie can stay home.", "NTA. She wasn't singled out. The rule applies for everyone and the others complied.", "NTA. You had to draw the line somewhere and if you start making exceptions for one you will just upset everyone else. This way you ARE treating all kids the same.", "NTA\n\nThe rule was neither made with your side of the family in mind, and you are right about the exception opening the flood gates.\n\nIs it unfortunate? Yeah, but you\u2019re not a bridezilla. You\u2019re making a very smart and reasonable choice and while the outcome is not a nice one, coddled chaos children at the wedding would only make it worse.\n\nIf Valerie\u2019s such an issue you could invite her and your sister to bridal party stuff, you could pass it off as \u201cit\u2019s my sister, and she insisted\u201d, which is something none of your future In Laws can say.\n\nThat way she gets to be included in something, you can take cute pictures in dress fittings, or go out for dinner together.", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s harder for the families with kids that are split, some coming and some not. I\u2019m the youngest and my 3 siblings were invited to a wedding that I wasn\u2019t.  They had a cut off of 16. We were the only family with the split, some going and some not. My parents explained it to me and I we did a sleepover with 2 of my cousins that weren\u2019t invited. \n\nYour sister is dealing with one child not going and one that can attend, one of which is a step child. So she is navigating that. \n\nWhat are the ages of the other kids that aren\u2019t coming. If you changed it 14, would there be others that would make the cut or just your sister\u2019s step daughter?", "\"Hi Valerie. I hear you've been pretty upset lately because you don't get to come to the wedding. I want you to know that it's not because we don't love you... We just have a lot of relatives who are young and we had to decide what the age cut off was going to be in order to be fair to everyone. But just because you aren't coming to the wedding doesn't mean we can't do something fun together... I was wondering if you'd like to [come with me to my dress fitting/help me with the centerpieces/tell me which program design you like better/see pictures of the hairstyles I'm considering/etc]?\"\n\nNTA. But given that she feels like she's being excluded (not terribly surprising given how close she is to the age cut off and given that her family only has her and her brother, so it's not like there's another kid who's not getting to go), it would absolutely be a kind and thoughtful gesture to include her in a part of the excitement some other way", "NTA. Tell your sister her entitlement is not your burden.", "NTA. Your sister is using this situation to try to prove to her step-daughter that she accepts her *so much* she's willing to go to the mat for her and create an ugly rift in her *own* family. She's probably doing it to impress Valerie's daddy too.\n\nLet her. Tell your mother your sister's family dynamics are not your problem and your wedding is not a battleground. Sister can keep her entire family from going and that's on her, but if she badgers you just disinvite her to make it easier.", "Idk. I get not a wanting kids at the wedding but 15 seems like a weird cutoff. Do you really think this 13 year old girl would be disruptive to a wedding?", "NTA. I can't understand why so many people feel so entitled to be the exception to the rule.", "INFO: how many 14 year olds on the husbands side? If there\u2019s close to none, or they\u2019re well behaved, can maybe consider lowering the age to 14 for everyone and just say (lie) that the request came from several parents.\n\nEither way, NAH. Your sister is fighting for her step child, so essentially just being a good step mom. Regardless, your reasoning is sound and no children under 15 means no children under 15. The step daughter has made it clear she feels estranged, but it has less to do with not being invited and more to do with the step brother being invited while she wasn\u2019t. \n\nIf you approach her directly and explain you didn\u2019t mean to make her feel left out, and explain the situation, maybe she\u2019ll be more receptive and maybe sister can let it go. Or if you do want to make the exception because she\u2019s a good kid and the others aren\u2019t, maybe just include her and lie if you\u2019re asked about it. \u201cWhoops, she\u2019s my step niece, thought she was 15!\u201d This way you can avoid punishing her for the behavior of the other runts. So long as Seth\u2019s onboard, of course.", "NTA. You could have been more strategic to avoid this by limiting the age to 18 and over. It was always going to be tough for parents to take some but not all children.", "NTA - Technically your sister is specifically trying to cause you to make an exception because she's her step child which is pointing out that she's her step child. Should you also invite any other step children that are currently 13 since step children should get an exception?\n\nYou didn't exclude her, you excluded all children under 15, with no step children exceptions.", "NTA but it probably would have been a better idea to just not invite anyone\u2019s children, regardless of age", "NTA childfree wedding is your choice therefore people have to abide by it I swear at least once  a day on here I see a  post somoen want a  child free wedding and relatives mak them feel bad you mad  a decision stick to it don't let people ruin your day for there needs over yours", "NTA- the less kids the less money spent. Weddings aren't for kids it for adults to get away from the kids lol.", "NTA. However I think you need to ask yourself if this is really worth it. Your sister clearly thinks that you\u2019re using this rule to exclude Valerie because you don\u2019t consider her a niece. Do you really want to hear about this if the rest of your life because I guarantee that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. Why not just increase the age limit to 18? That way none of the young teens in your family can go.", "Your sister can decide to not let her son attend. It's as easy as that it she's so bothered. \nNTA", "YTA \n15 is an arbitrary age that seems to be directly targeting someone. If you want a child-free wedding, make it 18. If you don\u2019t, then making an arbitrary cut off makes you the AH. \nThat being said, you have the right not to invite anybody, but don\u2019t hide behind the \u201cchild-free\u201d wedding when that is not child-free.", "I am curious how you came up with the number 15. \nAnd how many of the other kids not coming are close to that age?", "Why 15 and not 16 or 18? It feels like you are intentionally trying to include some kids. Your nephew should have been on the no invite list out of respect for the family unit. \n\nNTA because your wedding, your rules. But you brought unnecessary drama to your wedding", "I\u2019m all for your wedding your rules. However, I think having 15 as the minimum age is a bit strange. I mean, I think just saying teenagers and up might be better? I can see how your sister would be hurt to not be able to bring her stepdaughter, and her stepdaughter would feel very left out. Obviously if her stepdaughter was younger I wouldn\u2019t say that, but that fact she\u2019s almost 14 is tough. And I understand that you don\u2019t want to make any exceptions, because that would throw off everything. Maybe reconsider changing to 13+ ?", "NTA- and I would just tell her this.. Hey sis, you ever hear of a strawman argument- that's when one side makes up what the other side is saying and then argues against it. For the last time, Valerie is excluded because of her age along with 9 other of the cousins, nieces and nephews. If that's not sufficient to put your false argument to rest, then the reality is you just don't care you'll say anything to get your way and you just straight up want an exception. Not gonna happen, done discussing this.\n\nETA- and if you don't stop calling me names and giving me grief, I'll pull your invitation too.\n\nEdit2- if you give in on her, then you have to give in on the other 9 or you'll have a shitton of grief over why she gets an exception and we don't.... Tell your mom- stop- we've decided to have a child-free wedding, we'd appreciate your support. YOu know perfectly well that we aren't doing what sister is accusing us of, so please tell her that. I'm not going to reward her for bullying me and I'm not making an exception.", "It\u2019s kind of weird. Invite one or neither. I\u2019d be devastated to be left out at 13 if my whole family was included.", "YTA\n\nYou are choosing guaranteed conflict (not inviting Valerie) over imaginary conflict.\n\nBecause in what scenario would Seth's family be able to accurately tell a 14-year-old from a 15-year-old?

Now both kids can stay at home.", "NTA your sister is right, kid is not even your real family. Just tell her not to come", "NTA - Question: if you lowered the age to 13 or 14, would it make a lot of difference? For example, would it require that you add all of Seth\u2019s poorly behaved nieces and nephews back in? Just curious. Either way, You aren\u2019t required to give in to your sister\u2019s demands. Not her wedding,", "Or she could leave both her kids at home and enjoy a children wedding too!  NTA", "15 is seen as the 'coming of age' a la sweet 16 or bar/bat mitzvah, in several parts of the world. See: Quinceaneras", "True.  Still, 15 is young and moving the age to 16 or 18 eliminates the \u201c almost 15\u201d argument.", "Can you tell your sister it\u2019s that you hate this kid because she\u2019s not blood it\u2019s just her personality ?", "I mean she actually says I\u2019m the post the immature kids are on fianc\u00e9s side and she\u2019s not worried about Valerie. So not sure where you got that from.", "I\u2019m guessing 15 was chosen because the kids that don\u2019t behave on Seth\u2019s side are all under 15 (with one possibly going to be 14 by the wedding) and that maybe he has one or more no niblings that will be 15 by then that he actually wants to attend. That\u2019s what makes the most sense to me anyways", "NTA. \n1: it\u2019s Your wedding. Your rules.\n\n2: you are not singling anyone out.\n\n3: you are in fact treating her Exactly like every other family member.\n\n4: she is absolutely Not acting mature, not at all and certainly not for her age. \n\n5: but by the way your sister is throwing a tantrum herself and insisting that you follow her wants at your wedding, I can see how she\u2019d think locking oneself in a room an sulking is \u2018mature\u2019.", "My response would be to increase the age every time it comes up again", ">and that she wouldn't attend at all if Valerie couldn't\n\nCall her bluff.

No one needs to know her real age unless one of you blabs to create drama.", "Sorry but you should have benched both of them. Neither was acting like a good teammate. An apology given only after it was demanded does not cut at.", "NTA. Make it 18+ so Henry can\u2019t come either; then you\u2019re treating your sister\u2019s children equally.", "Any number you pick will be arbitrary tbf", "Having dealt with freshmen drama as a high school teacher, grades 10 and up is a good line to draw.  I don\u2019t know what it is about the sophomore year, but it seems to be a turning point in maturity.  Kids that were awful in middle school turn into decent human beings their sophomore year.  Not all, of course, but enough for me to feel ninth graders belong in junior high.  A kid who is 15 will either be at the tail end of their freshman year or will be a sophomore.", "While OP hasn't confirm this explicitly, they have confirmed in the comments that there is a particularly difficult 14 year old they don't want at the wedding.", "Sister is feeding the drama to stepdaughter. \n\nSee SD, OP doesn\u2019t love you as much as son because he\u2019s her *real* family. \n\nMom and sister are not making this situation any better by whining to OP because FaMiLy"]}
