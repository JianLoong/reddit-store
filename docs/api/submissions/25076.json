When the ring passed to your mom it becames hers to do with as she likes. When she passed it to you it became yours to do with as you'd agreed to: pass it forward to your mom's surrogate daughter. When you passed it your wife it became hers to do with as she pleases. The only person who gets to make a decisoms about the ring is your wife. If she wants to give it back, she gives it to you. If she wants to give it to the niece, she can. She is not obliged to. None of this is anyone else's business. Everyone was given opportunity to have an opinion before the ring was passed down. Now they can mind their own business.\n\nYour mom kept alive the tradition, and your aunt is being very disrespectful of that. Both women chose their daughters. The ring went to the eldest daughter.

I was heavily raised in my adoptive family\u2019s culture and traditions, I speak the family\u2019s native language (poorly), and no matter what, I will always be my parents\u2019 child and part of the family. \n\nThat\u2019s not necessarily true when it comes to family via marriage.
