Real curious how your wife marrying  you makes her less family than an adopted daughter.", "NTA. The time and place for them to have voiced any disagreement to the ring being given to your wife was YEARS ago. It is ridiculous for her to feel entitled now to take your wife\u2019s wedding ring. \n\nAlso, TECHNICALLY speaking, the ring staying with your wife and then passed to your daughter is the only way it ACTUALLY does \u201cstay in the family\u201d. Your daughter is a blood relation of your grandmother. Your sisters adoptive daughter and her kids later on are not.

Have it engraved with a nice family message. Then you can present it to your aunt for her daughter. 2 family rings to pass down. Usually only one particular branch of the family gets the heirlooms so why not make a nice new tradition?", "NTA. I feel like technically the biological line should have priority. I know it sounds awful, and as a general rule, adopted and steps do not exist in my family, they are all ours and not separated. My husband is an only child, and the family ring was passed down to me when we were married. He has one biological daughter, while I have one daughter, 3 sons. When his daughter became engaged, I gave the ring to her; as she is the rightful heir to it. Husband did not suggest this, or bring it up, I did.", "NTA.
