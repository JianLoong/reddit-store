My parents used me as a third parent for my younger siblings and nothing was ever about me but my birthday was the one day a year that was ever just about me. My 18th birthday was a few weeks and naturally I was excited and my mother did go really overboard with my birthday festivities, including a meal with the large extended family at a very fancy restaurant.My brother, D, (15M) has been dating his girlfriend for (15F) for four months and while she seems nice, she has made no attempt to talk or get to know any of us and there have been certain situations that are making me think she's a bad influence on my brother. So already I didn't exactly like her and my brother being together.\r  \n\r  \nD invited his girlfriend to our extended family meal without asking me. But he didn't tell her it was a fancy dinner so she came in joggers, a revealing crop top, crocs and hair in a messy bun (which I actually felt bad for, the rest of us were all dressed up). He spent his entire time there talking to his girlfriend and completely ignoring our cousin (also 15M) which I found incredibly rude. Our family tried to talk to his girlfriend but she gave rude short answers (which if she was nervous I sort of understand) and kept making mucky looks at my young cousin with autism who was tends to act like an animal.\r  \n\r  \nAfter the food was finished I looked around and couldn't see either of them. I asked where they'd gone and my mum said his girlfriend had to go home but instead of getting picked up at the restaurant they were walking back to ours where she'd get picked up. But we have a ring doorbell and she left two hours after they got back.\r  \n\r  \nFor an unrelated reason, D and I were arguing and it led to me admitting that I was really hurt that he chose to go back home and have 'alone time' with his girlfriend instead of celebrating on one of my most important birthdays in life. I harshly said that I don't like who he's becoming and while I know part of it is because he's a teenage lad, I also think his girlfriend is a bad influence.\r  \n\r  \nMy mum (who doesn't like the girlfriend but for no reason other than she's 'stealing her boy from her') actually told me off for saying that which is why I think I may be TA, especially since D must've told her because I just got back from work and she was in the kitchen giving me mucky looks.", "created_utc": 1688505023, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14qr34e/aita_for_telling_my_brother_i_dont_like_him_or/", "score": 175, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They are both only 15. They're still kids. The girlfriend could be a bad influence on your brother or she might just not be very good in family social situations given her age and inexperience. Your brother is a teenager. He only has one thing on his mind.\n\nI understand how important your 18 birthday was for you, so naturally you would have liked your brother to have made more of an effort. The fact that he chose not to stay longer to help you celebrate is a shame and you were right to make that point to him. If you do have genuine concerns about his girlfriend, you will need to tell him constructively otherwise he will get defensive and it may drive him further away from you and closer to the girlfriend (especially if he confides this to her).", "NTA. My parents stopped doing anything significant for my birthday when I was 7 (that was 1979 fyi) so I understand how you feel. At age 15, I knew enough to differentiate between rudeness and politeness. There shouldn't be any \"cutting of slack\" just because they're 15. You expressed your feelings as an adult should when talking to teens, and your brother reacted badly. Obviously your mother favors him and that should be a clear sign that your family is toxic. You are an adult and your days of parenting your sibling are over. You might have to move out but honestly that seems better than bring around those who cannot prioritize you for one day.", "NTA she sounds insufferable! Happy birthday anyway! Enjoy legal drinking!", ">\"my young cousin with autism who was tends to act like an animal.\"\n\nWhy was this ableist comment relevant??? It sounds like you have a lot of jealousy issues with the gf the same way a mother would (I'm assuming because of the parentification).

He came to your party for a while, then he got to bang his girlfriend. You both should have been happy, but you had to make a scene. \n\nYTA.", "NTA but I think you might be overreacting with the grudge, mainly against your brother. I mean on the list of priorities extended family+siste vs alone (I guess not often happening to have an empty house ) with girlfriend 15yo dude would choose...?", "YTA: Cleary you and your mom both have some issues with the girlfriend, but unlike you, your mom actually wants to see your brother be happy. Even so, every bad thing you mentioned about her, you provided an excuse why it might not be her fault. I get that it was YOUR birthday, but your own description of the scenario makes it seem like you were jealous all attention wasn\u2019t focused on you, and you were also jealous that your brother was happy. Was it rude of them to leave early? Yeah, sure. But it didn\u2019t justify your outburst. \n\nAlso, for what it\u2019s worth, the idea that a birthday party, regardless of the milestone, is \u201cimportant\u201d is ludicrous. 25 years from now, you won\u2019t even remember where you went on your 18th birthday. You will have far more significant birthdays than your 18th birthday between now and then.", "YTA\n\nOP, you come across as extremely immature here. Your brother attended your birthday party, you're not entitled to the rest of his day just because it's your birthday. You don't like his girlfriend because your brother failed to inform her of the dress code at your party, and she \"gave you looks\"? Get over yourself.", "NTA.

Been there, still there. Truly we're stronger than any marine.\n\nSucks that the you didn't get the full worship service for your big day, but you're not actually the third parent of a sibling three whole years younger than you.

Especially when they\u2019re already feeling self-conscious about being underdressed. Meeting a significant other\u2019s family is a particularly intimidating situation (and given OP\u2019s post and mom apparently being upset that someone is stealing her baby boy away, I\u2019m not sure how welcoming they actually are).", "She is interacting with the family though. OP said she answered questions and did speak to the family, did you actually read the post? This girl has done nothing disrespectful, OP is simply jealous of this girl because she feels entitled to her brother's time, and admits that she and her mother don't like this girl because she's spending time with OP's brother. Sounds like this family is enmeshed and doesn't have healthy boundaries.", "Agreed. I\u2019m an introvert who was also painfully socially awkward at 15. I literally had no idea how to socialize with people appropriately, which means I also had no idea that being \u201cquiet\u201d during a social event was considered rude. So any time I was quiet, which was often, was all because I was painfully self conscious, socially awkward, and shy. There was no malice behind it whatsoever.\n\nOP needs to give the kid a break.", "YTA. First of all, did YOU try to get to know his girlfriend better? Do you know anything about her family? Her background? Maybe she is just a shy person especially at 15!!! I feel bad for the girl coming to a fancy place dressed like she was while everyone around is dressed up. I\u2019d feel awkward too and would have definitely left earlier. It was indeed your day and party but you absolutely overreacted and to me you sound too judgmental about your brother\u2019s gf.", "OP only just turned 18, she's barely more than a kid herself. But hey she's the eldest girl so she needs to be the grownup. Misogyny ftw!", "YTA. They attended your party for a decent amount of time. You didn't own them for the entire day; your 18th birthday is really only a big deal to you. \n\n(Curious....if this is \"one of my most important birthdays in life\" for you, how many more super important birthdays are you planning?)  \n\nChecking up on them via camera is creepy on your part, so is your jealousy of his girlfriend. You may not like what you think your brother is becoming, but based on what you wrote  I kinda get why some folks may not like the way you are.\n\n If your cousin with autism tends to \"act like an animal\" as you say, no wonder the cousin was getting weird looks.", "NTA"]}
