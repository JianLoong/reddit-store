At first, I didn't have any issues with her, but things started to change pretty quickly. Every other week, she would throw these loud parties with a bunch of people, mainly in the evening.\n\nNormally, I wouldn't mind people having fun and enjoying themselves, but here's the catch: I work a night job, and the afternoon/evening is the only time I get to sleep. The walls in our building are quite thin, making it incredibly hard for me to sleep while she's hosting these parties.\n\nI tried talking to her about the noise issue multiple times, politely asking her to be quieter. To her credit, she made some effort to lower the volume after my requests, but it barely made any difference. I still couldn't sleep properly, and this went on for the past five months.\n\nI got fed up with her last week after I again asked her to turn it down but she just told me \u201cthat it wasn\u2019t her problem\u201d, this caused me to finally reach my breaking point and I decided to take matters into my own hands and ordered a large speaker, which I then used to blast music at full volume at 3 am. I admit, it was a pretty childish move on my part. I knew it would disturb her sleep, but I honestly felt like it was the only way to get my point across and make her understand what I was going through. She obviously confronted me about this but I simply responded that it \u201cwasn\u2019t my problem\u201d.\n \nNow, I'm left wondering if I was in the wrong here?", "created_utc": 1688631294, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14s2djy/aita_for_blasting_loud_music_at_3am/", "score": 756, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019re also affecting your other neighbors who had nothing to do with this lady. Pretty shitty OP.\n\n\nHave you talked to your landlord?", "YTA.\n\nPeople who sleep during odd hours cannot expect everyone else to be quiet. And according to your post it's not like it happens every day. It's every other week. Your neighbour is right, it's not her problem that you sleep during the day time. Blasting music at 3 AM is however against the rules and she can get you evicted if you continue.\n\nEdit: Just saw one of your post saying she's only noisy from 6-8 PM and after that they leave and go out. You're 100% the asshole here. You cannot expect people to be quiet at all time during normal hours.", "YTA. It\u2019s not her fault that you sleep during most people\u2019s waking hours. As long as she\u2019s within whatever noise limits are in place for your area, she\u2019s good. You meanwhile, are petty. It will be your problem when the police get called when you are being a dick at 3am", "YTA\n\nNoise ordinance laws are a thing and you are breaking them.", "~~ESH/INFO~~ YTA\n\nEdit: updated to YTA, neighbor is hosting people for two hours every other week from 6-8pm. Seems completely reasonable to me.\n\nShe\u2019s maybe an asshole for throwing loud parties every other week in a building with thin walls and neighbors. Kinda need more INFO though, like how late they go. It would be annoying to me but it\u2019s not strictly asshole behavior to host parties regularly, especially if they end at a reasonable time and/or are on weekends. You also admit she made an effort to be quieter.\n\nYou\u2019re an asshole for blasting music until 3am. I get your frustration, but I do think going out to buy a speaker and blasting it full volume when most people sleep is an AH move. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you have to deal with this, especially because it interrupts your sleep. Is the landlord/management company any help? I assume you\u2019ve tried ear plugs?", "Yta. Between \u201cnormal\u201d hours of the work day people are free to play music however loud they want. Quiet time usually begins after 10pm, when the average person is going to sleep/winding down. Shes allowed to play music, blasting music at 3am is not only not allowed in most buildings, but likely illegal where you are and VERY rude to your other neighbors who had nothing to do with your childish dispute. Either get some ear plugs or switch to a shift where you sleep during your buildings quiet hours.", "Yta.   \n\nYou live in an apartment. Do you really think no one else next to you can hear that music also?   So you think it's OK to fuck them all over just to get back at one person?", "If she\u2019s not breaking any rules then honestly not being able to sleep ISN\u2019T her problem. You most certainly are breaking some rules if not the law. You might see this as her disrespecting you but assuming she\u2019s not violating any rules then she is respecting you. By respecting the rules that everyone agreed to when they signed the lease.\n\nEveryone\u2019s commenting about the other people are missing the point. It could literally be only you two and you would still be the AH. Yes it would be nice if she went out of her way to accommodate your situation, but she isn\u2019t. Get over it. Find a solution. Move, change shifts, get a white noise machine, whatever. If i was her i would call the cops every time you\u2019d do this to try to get you fined because you\u2019re clearly in the wrong. YTA.", "YTA and will probably get evicted or fined. All that because she plays music for two hours in the evening, once every two weeks.\n\nAlso I'm confused over your sleeping hours. 3pm will be in the middle of her/average person's sleep, only allowing her 4 hours. For her to be doing the same to you, your sleeping hours would be 3pm - 11pm.", "Former night shift here \n\nYTA\n\nYou need to get some earplug, a fan, or something else to block the sound or find a different place with less neighbors or no wall sharing because the world will. Not. Stop. For your alternative schedule\n\nYou're lucky you didn't get the cops called for blaring music at 3 am. Every single place I've lived (save the one I'm in now because I live outside city limits and have no neighbors to speak of) has had a noise ordinance that goes into effect at 11 pm or thereabouts.", "YTA - it's tricky though. She either learned her lesson, or you guys will have this back and forth until one of you moves out. You gambled, let's hope the odds are in your favour.\n\nEdit: changed my answer to YTA... turns out this girl is \"having parties\" between 6 PM and 8 PM........ get a house. The girl and her friends pregame at her place before going out to the club and you are a straight up hater.", "YTA, I work overnights (8pm to 630am) and would never expect my neighbors to be quiet while I sleep. I'm the one whose working odd hours and my neighbors don't need to accommodate my sleeping schedule (my husband and kids do though). You even said she did lower the noise some and that still wasn't enough for you. I use a fan and a music cozy to help drown out any outside noise, maybe try something like that. You are lucky she didn't call the cops on you at 3am.", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s 3am and there are more people in the goddamn building than her unless it\u2019s a duplex! You are affecting innocent bystanders with your childishness. This is coming from a midnight worker who lived in a mobile home with tons of kids in the neighborhood. Get some fucking ear plugs.", "YATA    It's not her fault you have sleep hours in the legal noise time.", "YTA\n\n\nDon't know your local laws but between 10pm and 6am are quiet hours where I life. So blasting the music alone makes YTA.\n\nBut seeing in one of your comments that you complain about music played between 6pm and 8pm every other week.... So it's neither a daily issue nor for a long time when it happens. And you get passive aggressive over that?\n\nI started my work life in nightshift, so I know how fucked up the sleep schedule can be. But that situation is a you problem.", "YTA, unless you are the only two in the building.  You most likely woke the entire building up AH.", "Get earplugs. YTA for all the reasons already stated.", "YTA- you work nights. Loud hours are during the day. I guarantee you just violated your lease for the noise.\n\nApartments are loud during the day.", "YTA. You know it's childish and you still did it. While not great, making noise during allowed hours is legal...for a reason....you can't expect everyone to work around YOUR life. Also, she DID make an effort and LOWERED the volume...it's not like she was being a b\\*tch about it.\n\nNow YOU blasting music at 3am not only was illegal, but I'm sure disturbed the WHOLE building. You better hope no one complains to the landlord, as you're  the only one who's in the wrong here.", "YTA. You even said that she tried to compromise, in social hours too. What you did wasn\u2019t even childish, it was premeditated and purposely AH behaviour doing it 3am during anti social hours. This is AH on sitcom levels of dumbness. Well done \ud83d\udc4d", "INFO: when you say mainly in the evening, what time are these parties of hers? Like 6pm til 12 midnight or 9pm - 3am, it makes a difference.", "YTA. \n\n\nAlso this is the fake other side of a thread from the other day.", "YTA\n\nCheck the terms and conditions of your lease, it will contain the quite hours. If not the quiet hours from your state/city law applies. \n\nUsually you are allowed to be noisy from 6 or 7am till 10pm. \n\nIf her parties are not during quiet hours, she is fine and you having a different schedule is not her problem. If you blast music at 3am, this is definitly during official quiet hours and she can not only report you to the landlord but also calling the police if you do it again - so yes, this IS your problem. \n\nThats just what comes with working night shift, you are awake when the majority sleeps and vise versa - and since the majority works normal hours, the law most likely will not change. Get used to it and get a pair of noisecancelling headphones or move to an apartment with better isolation or in a retirement estate - these guys are usually very quiet (and its not uncommen for nightshifters to live where only old ppl live for this exact reason).", "INFO: How frequent are her parties? Like everyday or multiple times a week?\n\nAlso keep in mind that beeing louder in the evening is okay to a certain point however blasting music at night enables her to call to police and get you in more trouble.", "Edit: YTA, having two hour parties every other week is not unreasonable and even though she is aware of your sleep schedule she does not intrude that much, while your action was clearly petty and intrusive.", "YTA just start at 7Am instead so at least so you're not breaking any laws", "YatA. Your sleep hours are not typical and the whole world doesn't need to change for you.\nGet yourself headphones or a noise machine or MOVE.\nShe is allowed be live a full life in her home .", "Obviously YTA. 3am is when most people are sleeping. It\u2019s not their fault that you don\u2019t sleep during regular hours. Most places have rules where you can\u2019t play music past a certain time. You\u2019re bothering people who have nothing to do with this situation for petty reasons", "YTA - I might have gone E S H had your neighbor refused right off the bat. But it sounds like she's tried to accommodate several times. \n\nI think you went the passive aggressive route instead of taking the time to sit her down and, I presume, not explaining fully why the noise bothers you but also what you both can do to compromise. But even if you have, it sounds like the walls just may be too thin, unless your neighbor has barely turned it down to also spite you (but you don't seem to make it clear if that's the case).\n\nEither way, this is only going to escalate if you continue this. It's not solving anything. It sucks you have an alternative schedule to others where you need quiet in the evenings, but I'm not sure there's much you can do if the noise is still too much when she's turned it down for you. But the way you're going about it is only going to make your problems worse, not better.", "Ear plugs. YTA. You're in an apartment, sharing a building with strangers. This is the effect of that.", "INFO: Why can't you sleep in the morning instead of afternoon? When I worked nights for 4 years I found that worked best cause it was when most people were working.", "Didn't we have the inverse of this post the other day? I'm sure I read one about someone hosting people in the daytime and a neighbor who worked nights retaliating at 3am...", "YTA. Your sleep schedule is not the rest of the world's problem.

You have the right to ask her to turn it down if the volume is truly excessive, but you can't expect your neighbours tiptoe around and to never have friends over.\n\nDo you have noise cancelling ear plugs that are specifically designed for sleep?\n\nI did extensive research for about 15 sec and see that it would cost between $1,000 and $2500 to soundproof a room. This may be something you will have to consider at one point or seek new accommodation.", "YTA. You work nights but most people don't. She is only noise between 6-8pm which shows she is being considerate of everyone who doesn't work nights in the apartment complex(which vastly outnumber you). \n\nHopefully she files a complaint about you for being noisy during quiet hours.", "YTA Sorry you work weird hours but that\u2019s your choice. Society has a normal set of living hours. No one should be blasting music in an apartment at any hour but you definitely shouldn\u2019t be blasting it at a time where most people are sleeping.", "YTA you go to bed at different times to the vast majority, which means you can\u2019t complain when they make noise in the house when the majority is awake. The noise is from 6pm to 8pm and then they stop. However you blasting music at 3am is not only going to wake your neighbour but is also going to wake up other people in the apartment block. Which isn\u2019t fair. It also can get you evicted. Buy some noise cancelling headphones", "YTA, champ.\n\nHow about everyone else around you?

Nice for you tho", "My account is 8 years old homie, you\u2019re actually on a fast track with -23 in 3 days\n\nAlso wait did someone who doesn\u2019t like people playing music at 7 pm just tell me to get a life \ud83d\ude2d", "That is very unfortunate. Have you considerd working at a prison? They are often in small towns where rural living is just a few minutes away as well as infrastructure to support the prison.", "Sure, and I'm the exact same way when it comes to respecting neighbors and would always try to minimize noise if it were requested because i like to get along with the people i live near. But if i worked nights and people had music on in the day and refused to turn it down, yeah I'd be pissed but i know I'm the odd man out and would just figure something out. Noise cancelling headphones and a box fan, whatever", "So, you can NEVER have people over to your house, even if it\u2019s only 4 hours a month? That is completely unreasonable and the fact you don\u2019t understand that has to be deliberate ignorance.", "That's why I said both parties have an obligation to take measures to be respectful to the neighbors. That's the shittiest part of living in an apartment: you don't get to do all the things you want to do without being an asshole. And knowing your neighbor works night shifts and not just finding another venue for your get-togethers? Shitty. Conversely, knowing your neighbors enjoy bi-weekly get-togethers where there will be some degree of noise and not investing in noise-reduction measures instead of bitching? Also shitty.", "Are you kidding? I was being sarcastic when I said \"oh why didn't I think of that?\" I can't afford a house either. Of course I would rather be in a house than my loud apartment.", "Lol it's at -76 now", "I honestly don't know if I could handle that. I currently have a good job that allows me to support me and my wife while still getting a good amount of time at home, but since I work on boats, I need to be close to the water.", "Yah, I just speak from experience that headphones and fans don't do the job in my apartment.", "I think you can have people over but you don't need to play loud music. OP has specifically asked her. If I was her, I would try to see if any of the other friends coming to the party could host instead, since just numbers wise, they probably don't live next to someone who works graveyard and has requested quiet during the hours they want a party.", ">Figure it out\" is \"honestly\" good advice?\n\nHow about \"get over it\"?", "Fair enough. I apologize", "Do not work at a prison. My wife works with workers' comp clients, and the mental and physical issues that affect prison guards are the stuff of nightmares", "To you, it\u2019s not. To her, it clearly is. Percentage-wise, she\u2019s accommodating him basically 100% of the time. She\u2019s loud for 2 hours out of 336. That\u2019s 0.5%. 1/2 of 1%. And during extremely normal hours for most of the planet. OP is a huge AH and extremely entitled. He needs to get noise-cancelling headphones if this is truly such a problem for him.", "It's not my job to figure out how another person lives, I get he works odd hours but unless he directly requests something of me I'm going to follow normal rules. Blasting music at 3am is not allowed in any apartment complex I've ever been in and I would file a noise complaint immediately as he was obviously being a jerk", "I'm guessing it's an older building then. Things built a little further back (I'm looking at you, 90's) were basically papier mache", "I just thought it was so obvious, sorry", "This is what I've heard.", ">To her, it clearly is\n\nNo, I'm not going to be convinced that loud music is a need at the same level as being able to sleep.", ">unless he directly requests something of me\n\nI mean he did. He asked her to turn it down but it wasn't enough. So he asked again. Still not enough."]}
