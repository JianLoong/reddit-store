At first, I didn't have any issues with her, but things started to change pretty quickly. Every other week, she would throw these loud parties with a bunch of people, mainly in the evening.\n\nNormally, I wouldn't mind people having fun and enjoying themselves, but here's the catch: I work a night job, and the afternoon/evening is the only time I get to sleep. The walls in our building are quite thin, making it incredibly hard for me to sleep while she's hosting these parties.\n\nI tried talking to her about the noise issue multiple times, politely asking her to be quieter. To her credit, she made some effort to lower the volume after my requests, but it barely made any difference. I still couldn't sleep properly, and this went on for the past five months.\n\nI got fed up with her last week after I again asked her to turn it down but she just told me \u201cthat it wasn\u2019t her problem\u201d, this caused me to finally reach my breaking point and I decided to take matters into my own hands and ordered a large speaker, which I then used to blast music at full volume at 3 am. I admit, it was a pretty childish move on my part. I knew it would disturb her sleep, but I honestly felt like it was the only way to get my point across and make her understand what I was going through. She obviously confronted me about this but I simply responded that it \u201cwasn\u2019t my problem\u201d.\n \nNow, I'm left wondering if I was in the wrong here?", "created_utc": 1688631294, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14s2djy/aita_for_blasting_loud_music_at_3am/", "score": 196, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019re also affecting your other neighbors who had nothing to do with this lady. Pretty shitty OP.\n\n\nHave you talked to your landlord?", "YTA.\n\nPeople who sleep during odd hours cannot expect everyone else to be quiet. And according to your post it's not like it happens every day. It's every other week. Your neighbour is right, it's not her problem that you sleep during the day time. Blasting music at 3 AM is however against the rules and she can get you evicted if you continue.\n\nEdit: Just saw one of your post saying she's only noisy from 6-8 PM and after that they leave and go out. You're 100% the asshole here. You cannot expect people to be quiet at all time during normal hours.", "YTA. It\u2019s not her fault that you sleep during most people\u2019s waking hours. As long as she\u2019s within whatever noise limits are in place for your area, she\u2019s good. You meanwhile, are petty. It will be your problem when the police get called when you are being a dick at 3am", "YTA\n\nNoise ordinance laws are a thing and you are breaking them.", "~~ESH/INFO~~ YTA\n\nEdit: updated to YTA, neighbor is hosting people for two hours every other week from 6-8pm. Seems completely reasonable to me.\n\nShe\u2019s maybe an asshole for throwing loud parties every other week in a building with thin walls and neighbors. Kinda need more INFO though, like how late they go. It would be annoying to me but it\u2019s not strictly asshole behavior to host parties regularly, especially if they end at a reasonable time and/or are on weekends. You also admit she made an effort to be quieter.\n\nYou\u2019re an asshole for blasting music until 3am. I get your frustration, but I do think going out to buy a speaker and blasting it full volume when most people sleep is an AH move. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you have to deal with this, especially because it interrupts your sleep. Is the landlord/management company any help? I assume you\u2019ve tried ear plugs?", "Yta. Between \u201cnormal\u201d hours of the work day people are free to play music however loud they want. Quiet time usually begins after 10pm, when the average person is going to sleep/winding down. Shes allowed to play music, blasting music at 3am is not only not allowed in most buildings, but likely illegal where you are and VERY rude to your other neighbors who had nothing to do with your childish dispute. Either get some ear plugs or switch to a shift where you sleep during your buildings quiet hours.", "Yta.   \n\nYou live in an apartment. Do you really think no one else next to you can hear that music also?   So you think it's OK to fuck them all over just to get back at one person?", "If she\u2019s not breaking any rules then honestly not being able to sleep ISN\u2019T her problem. You most certainly are breaking some rules if not the law. You might see this as her disrespecting you but assuming she\u2019s not violating any rules then she is respecting you. By respecting the rules that everyone agreed to when they signed the lease.\n\nEveryone\u2019s commenting about the other people are missing the point. It could literally be only you two and you would still be the AH. Yes it would be nice if she went out of her way to accommodate your situation, but she isn\u2019t. Get over it. Find a solution. Move, change shifts, get a white noise machine, whatever. If i was her i would call the cops every time you\u2019d do this to try to get you fined because you\u2019re clearly in the wrong. YTA.", "YTA and will probably get evicted or fined. All that because she plays music for two hours in the evening, once every two weeks.\n\nAlso I'm confused over your sleeping hours. 3pm will be in the middle of her/average person's sleep, only allowing her 4 hours. For her to be doing the same to you, your sleeping hours would be 3pm - 11pm.", "Former night shift here \n\nYTA\n\nYou need to get some earplug, a fan, or something else to block the sound or find a different place with less neighbors or no wall sharing because the world will. Not. Stop. For your alternative schedule\n\nYou're lucky you didn't get the cops called for blaring music at 3 am. Every single place I've lived (save the one I'm in now because I live outside city limits and have no neighbors to speak of) has had a noise ordinance that goes into effect at 11 pm or thereabouts.", "YTA - it's tricky though. She either learned her lesson, or you guys will have this back and forth until one of you moves out. You gambled, let's hope the odds are in your favour.\n\nEdit: changed my answer to YTA... turns out this girl is \"having parties\" between 6 PM and 8 PM........ get a house. The girl and her friends pregame at her place before going out to the club and you are a straight up hater.", "YTA, I work overnights (8pm to 630am) and would never expect my neighbors to be quiet while I sleep. I'm the one whose working odd hours and my neighbors don't need to accommodate my sleeping schedule (my husband and kids do though). You even said she did lower the noise some and that still wasn't enough for you. I use a fan and a music cozy to help drown out any outside noise, maybe try something like that. You are lucky she didn't call the cops on you at 3am.", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s 3am and there are more people in the goddamn building than her unless it\u2019s a duplex! You are affecting innocent bystanders with your childishness. This is coming from a midnight worker who lived in a mobile home with tons of kids in the neighborhood. Get some fucking ear plugs.", "YATA    It's not her fault you have sleep hours in the legal noise time.", "YTA\n\n\nDon't know your local laws but between 10pm and 6am are quiet hours where I life. So blasting the music alone makes YTA.\n\nBut seeing in one of your comments that you complain about music played between 6pm and 8pm every other week.... So it's neither a daily issue nor for a long time when it happens. And you get passive aggressive over that?\n\nI started my work life in nightshift, so I know how fucked up the sleep schedule can be. But that situation is a you problem.", "YTA, unless you are the only two in the building.  You most likely woke the entire building up AH.", "Get earplugs. YTA for all the reasons already stated.", "YTA- you work nights. Loud hours are during the day. I guarantee you just violated your lease for the noise.\n\nApartments are loud during the day.", "YTA. You know it's childish and you still did it. While not great, making noise during allowed hours is legal...for a reason....you can't expect everyone to work around YOUR life. Also, she DID make an effort and LOWERED the volume...it's not like she was being a b\\*tch about it.\n\nNow YOU blasting music at 3am not only was illegal, but I'm sure disturbed the WHOLE building. You better hope no one complains to the landlord, as you're  the only one who's in the wrong here.", "YTA. You even said that she tried to compromise, in social hours too. What you did wasn\u2019t even childish, it was premeditated and purposely AH behaviour doing it 3am during anti social hours. This is AH on sitcom levels of dumbness. Well done \ud83d\udc4d", "INFO: when you say mainly in the evening, what time are these parties of hers? Like 6pm til 12 midnight or 9pm - 3am, it makes a difference.", "YTA. \n\n\nAlso this is the fake other side of a thread from the other day.", "YTA\n\nCheck the terms and conditions of your lease, it will contain the quite hours. If not the quiet hours from your state/city law applies. \n\nUsually you are allowed to be noisy from 6 or 7am till 10pm. \n\nIf her parties are not during quiet hours, she is fine and you having a different schedule is not her problem. If you blast music at 3am, this is definitly during official quiet hours and she can not only report you to the landlord but also calling the police if you do it again - so yes, this IS your problem. \n\nThats just what comes with working night shift, you are awake when the majority sleeps and vise versa - and since the majority works normal hours, the law most likely will not change. Get used to it and get a pair of noisecancelling headphones or move to an apartment with better isolation or in a retirement estate - these guys are usually very quiet (and its not uncommen for nightshifters to live where only old ppl live for this exact reason).", "INFO: How frequent are her parties? Like everyday or multiple times a week?\n\nAlso keep in mind that beeing louder in the evening is okay to a certain point however blasting music at night enables her to call to police and get you in more trouble.", "Edit: YTA, having two hour parties every other week is not unreasonable and even though she is aware of your sleep schedule she does not intrude that much, while your action was clearly petty and intrusive.", "YTA just start at 7Am instead so at least so you're not breaking any laws", "YatA. Your sleep hours are not typical and the whole world doesn't need to change for you.\nGet yourself headphones or a noise machine or MOVE.\nShe is allowed be live a full life in her home .", "Obviously YTA. 3am is when most people are sleeping. It\u2019s not their fault that you don\u2019t sleep during regular hours. Most places have rules where you can\u2019t play music past a certain time. You\u2019re bothering people who have nothing to do with this situation for petty reasons", "YTA - I might have gone E S H had your neighbor refused right off the bat. But it sounds like she's tried to accommodate several times. \n\nI think you went the passive aggressive route instead of taking the time to sit her down and, I presume, not explaining fully why the noise bothers you but also what you both can do to compromise. But even if you have, it sounds like the walls just may be too thin, unless your neighbor has barely turned it down to also spite you (but you don't seem to make it clear if that's the case).\n\nEither way, this is only going to escalate if you continue this. It's not solving anything. It sucks you have an alternative schedule to others where you need quiet in the evenings, but I'm not sure there's much you can do if the noise is still too much when she's turned it down for you. But the way you're going about it is only going to make your problems worse, not better.", "Ear plugs. YTA. You're in an apartment, sharing a building with strangers. This is the effect of that.", "INFO: Why can't you sleep in the morning instead of afternoon? When I worked nights for 4 years I found that worked best cause it was when most people were working.", "Didn't we have the inverse of this post the other day? I'm sure I read one about someone hosting people in the daytime and a neighbor who worked nights retaliating at 3am...", "YTA. Your sleep schedule is not the rest of the world's problem.

You have the right to ask her to turn it down if the volume is truly excessive, but you can't expect your neighbours tiptoe around and to never have friends over.\n\nDo you have noise cancelling ear plugs that are specifically designed for sleep?\n\nI did extensive research for about 15 sec and see that it would cost between $1,000 and $2500 to soundproof a room. This may be something you will have to consider at one point or seek new accommodation.", "YTA. You work nights but most people don't. She is only noise between 6-8pm which shows she is being considerate of everyone who doesn't work nights in the apartment complex(which vastly outnumber you). \n\nHopefully she files a complaint about you for being noisy during quiet hours.", "YTA Sorry you work weird hours but that\u2019s your choice. Society has a normal set of living hours. No one should be blasting music in an apartment at any hour but you definitely shouldn\u2019t be blasting it at a time where most people are sleeping.", "YTA you go to bed at different times to the vast majority, which means you can\u2019t complain when they make noise in the house when the majority is awake. The noise is from 6pm to 8pm and then they stop. However you blasting music at 3am is not only going to wake your neighbour but is also going to wake up other people in the apartment block. Which isn\u2019t fair. It also can get you evicted. Buy some noise cancelling headphones", "YTA, champ.\n\nHow about everyone else around you?

It's not about \"it's only 6-8\" to me, it's about \"I asked you human to human to help me, and I would do the same for you.\" I understand from these threads popping up every now and then (and from living in a loud apartment building) that my opinion is not commonly shared, but I still have it.", "My wife is the same way, and I would love if people were considerate even though it's \"reasonable\" or \"not against the rules\" to be noisy.", "Nope, it just seems that way cuz I'm the only person that agrees with them.  I'm just another person going through hell because of noise in my apartment building that's \"not against the rules\" but still causes distress.", "Yeah,  I had a roller coaster on this one \n\nTitle: YTA\n\nPost: NTA \n\nComments: YTA", "Of course it matters. Daytime and early evening noise is expected. \n\nThink about it, businesses all follow time rules for noise; there can be noise from a business, road works, maintenance, etc during assigned hours daytime hours, allowing us to plan out live around these hours.\n\nImagine trying to enforce rules that no-one is allowed to make noise during the day. I used to live by a school, you have any idea how noisy that can be?! It disturbed my peace but I don't go round my neighbourhood with a loud speaker as revenge.", "Your lifestyle is not compatible with apartment living.  You need to figure it out.", "Then share your money, money bags", "I mean, I think there's a certain risk to living in apartments to begin with. You don't really have control over what happens in other people's apartments if they're still following the rules in the building. \n\nNeighbor has tried to accommodate; it's not like she refused right off the bat. She's turned down the music, just not enough to satisfy OP. And it sounds like OP hasn't made time to sit and have a discussion with the neighbor on why the noise bothers them and what they can do to compromise. \n\nIt's tricky; had neighbor said \"not my problem\" the first time, I wouldn't think OP is an asshole. But it sounds like the neighbor has tried and OP isn't satisfied that the music is still too loud (and likely the people are also too loud). So the only solution seems to be the neighbor stops throwing parties on the nights OP has to work (which, if it's a weekend, is unlikely to happen).", "Except OP does say that their neighbour has turned down the music before, it's just still too loud for OP. Neighbour is probably sick of OP continuously telling her every other week when she HAS turned the music down. How much lower does OP expect the music to get if she HAS turned it down multiple times? \n\nThe main issue is that we don't know exactly how  loud the music is or what OP constitutes as \"blasting\". Because if other neighbors aren't complaining about it, maybe the issue is that the walls are too thin and any normal volume is still too loud for OP. It's likely that it IS loud since it's a party, but it's not like neighbor has said \"no, not my problem\" off the bat. This is after multiple instances of OP going to ask her to turn it down. \n\nIs it shitty? Sure, but it's either the neighbor has to stop throwing parties because of OP since the party itself is too loud, or OP needs to deal with the fact that they live in an apartment, where total peace and quiet is unlikely (within the rules of the building). Neighbor has tried to accommodate but either OP is being way too picky or neighbor is barely turning the music down to begin with, and we don't have enough info to say which one is correct.", "It sounds like you are not a good candidate for apartment living. If sound is bothersome, rural areas are both affordable and allow you to have whatever controversial opinion you want.", "He clarified that it's once in awhile that she has people over from 6pm to 8pm. She makes an effort to be quiet. It's not like she is having a party or pointing speakers at the wall and blasting music...", "But do you genuinely think that OP isint the asshole? This problem happens once every 2 weeks. I really don\u2019t believe you can be mad at people for them not accommodating to your sleeping schedule??? Especially when over half the building doesn\u2019t follow said schedule.", "It\u2019s unfortunate but OP was rude to another tenant who was following the rules and therefore doing nothing wrong. OP should be upset with building management if that\u2019s the case", "I can also see a school from my back garden. So even with the doors shut I can hear the kids out for playtime etc. \n\nThere can be noise yes. But it shouldn\u2019t disturb anyone else. Regardless of the time.", "neither is a lifestyle where you are disturbing neighbours, ie, by having loud parties.\n\nit cuts both ways. if you want to party, get a detached house.", "Bro, that's really good advice, thank you", ">I mean, I think there's a certain risk to living in apartments to begin with.\n\nWell yah, but do you think everyone *wants\" to live in apartments? For most, it's what they can afford. Of course there are outliers who prefer apartment to house, but for people who hate the noise their apartment neighbors make, I guarantee you they would rather be in a house.", ">Is it shitty? Sure, but it's either the neighbor has to stop throwing parties because of OP since the party itself is too loud,\n\nSounds good. It sucks, but I think living in an apartment, one should be considerate of their neighbors noise needs.", "Believe me, I loathe living in an apartment, and I'm trying to do exactly what you say. It's really really hard to find anything I can afford where I can still commute to my job.", ">It's not like she is having a party\n\nI mean OP calls it a party. I guess you can doubt that, but I'd assume it was, albeit a short one.", "I genuinely think OP is NTA specifically for wanting their neighbor to be quiet. I think they're an asshole for doing the music at 3am. But yes, I think people in apartments should be quiet. I acknowledge that it sucks to watch your noise all the time, but personally I think it sucks less than not being able to have peace. If my neighbor asked me to be quiet because they can't sleep, I would absolutely accommodate them, even if I wanted to be louder, and even if I didn't have to be quiet according to the rules.", "Even if you think it's true in this case, is it actually your moral code that if someone is following rules, they can't possibly be doing something wrong? Like right and wrong has a 1:1 correlation with rules and laws?", "Shit, better ban all construction work then. And children.", "It honestly is, what better advice would you like? Get some earplugs??", "That goes both ways.", "She was considerate. She's turned it down per OP's requests multiple times.", "A 2 hour 'party'from 6pm-8pm twice a month is not a reason to have that kind of reaction.", "She wasn\u2019t doing anything wrong \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f she plays loud music once every 2 weeks that\u2019s within HER rules. So yea, I don\u2019t think she did anything wrong. OP is TA. How unrealistic to expect others to accommodate you EVERYNIGHT when you live a building with set noise hours. Not to mention OP did complain to his landlord. He was trying to get her in trouble for following rules that inconvenienced him.", "It honestly is? \"Figure it out\" is \"honestly\" good advice? Do you think I'm unaware that an apartment isn't the best situation for me? Do you think I don't live in a house instead because I just love the idea of living in an apartment so much?", "Yes. He shouldn't have blasted music at 3am. But her playing music is not a \"noise need.\"", "I disagree. It's considerate to allow someone to sleep. If this doesn't, I consider that inconsiderate.", "I don't think you understand what I was asking. Even if you agree with the rule in this case, you used the argument \"she was following the rules and therefore doing nothing wrong.\" I'm saying that this implies the rules are inherently right, with no examination of their rightness. Is that what you believe?", "Ear plugs\n\nSound proofing\n\nNoise canceling headphones", "I know my reply and the previous one my sound trite but it is the only advice one can offer you. \u201cFiguring it out\u201d is not meant to sound easy, it can be tough and take a lot of time and work but it is your only option besides earplugs", "I\u2019m talking about this specific situation. Why are you bringing up the morality of law. My point is OP was TA and it\u2019s ridiculous to say otherwise. In this case yea I think the rules are gonna determine the \u201cmorality\u201d in this situation. Also you do realize a person can believe that the rules determine the \u201cmorality\u201d in this decision and not all others. It\u2019s not black and white.", "My wife (who is the one with noise issues) has ear plugs and noise cancelling headphones, and a sleep mask wrap that plays music or white noise, and a white noise machine, and still gets woken up when our neighbors make huge bangs with whatever the hell they do up there.\n\nI'm actually not sure what sound proofing we can do against our upstairs neighbors. We lament every day that our landlord decided to increase appeal by removing carpet in favor of laminate hardwood.", "Okay, that makes sense. I was genuinely asking. I personally don't feel that the rules are moral in this situation, because they ignore people who don't slot into traditional work and sleep times."]}
