How can she simultaneously believe that everyone wants to look like her *and* that she needs to lose 100 pounds? That's some serious mental gymnastics.", "Soft ESH, your friend who thinks everyone else is Green with envy needed a wake-up call but this was probably not the kindest way to do it. She definitely sucks for invalidating the friend who is being compared to the cousin. ...", "ESH.  Your friend with the over developed sense of self sounds insufferable BUT calling her out was hurtful.  People who act like this often don't really believe what they say themselves and actually have fragile egos.", "Yup. I worked with a woman like this once. She fretted and ranted about how she couldn't make friends because other women were so envious of her.\n\nTrust me, that isn't why no one wanted to be her friend.", "The odds are that life will give her a wake up call when she is outside of the safety of her friends group.\n\nShe sounds narcissistic enough that she is mislabeling other women actually shying away from her toxicity as jealousy over her beauty.\n\nIf she is hetero and approaches guys with that same warped sense of herself, she is likely to get feedback so blunt she will have much less opportunity to misconstrue its meaning.", "Real friends tell each other the blunt, harsh truths. She needed a reality check. \n\nNTA", "I think your friend may have a mental health condition. I'm saying this as someone with one too, not as an insult. \n\nOne of my close friends, who has been diagnosed with a condition, had behaviour similar to this when I met her in university. There is a lot of stigma associated with it, and I'm not going to name it because I don't want to put an idea into your head that something like this could be diagnosed by a non-professional and based on so little info - but there are some signs here consistent with what my friend has, now recieves treatment for and manages very well. \n\nThe reason I'm saying this is that it might well be the case that she has something going on, and that talking to her like this won't be the wake up call you might expect. \n\nI'd suggest that you have a few options going forward:\n1) if you are concerned about her or want to preserve the friendship, approach her with empathy and explain clearly to her the impact her behaviour has on you, asking her to be mindful of it when she's around you - listen to her about it too, clear the air\n2) if you can't tolerate it, distance yourself from her for a while\n\nSimply \"calling out\" behaviour like you did isn't an issue in itself, and I feel your frustration with her behaviour through your post, so I don't think you're TA or have done anything wrong. \n\nThere's a much better chance she'd understand and take on board what you are saying if you say it clearly and calmly and focusing on the impact it's having on you. \n\nJust to be clear, in not saying that she has any condition or that you should say this to her or speculate on it with people. I am saying that her behaviour is not normal and she might not be able to understand that, especially if presented with a \"wake up call\" in an emotional situation or in front of people or in a way she feels is a personal attack. Learn from my mistakes - I triggered a shame spiral in my friend that ended up having the opposite result than I wanted when I confronted her about behaviour before. It was a bad time. I've spoken about it with my therapist and learned more about her condition since then. She's put in lots of work too, and now we have good times.", "NTA she's clearly very insecure about her appearance and is over compensating but doing it to the point of invalidating everyone else.", "Not the AH.  Just wait until she starts talking about herself that way around some drunk guys at the bar.  I guarantee a major wake up call!", "NTA  This sounds just like a girl who tried to make everyone think I was bullying her in college. People I knew from my dorm started to come up and tell me to stop being weird about S. I legitimately had no clue who S was (I'm a bit of a space case). For months people would ask me if I was okay because I was supposedly so jealous of this person. \n\nEnded up called into the Residence Hall Advisors office about it. I was like \"I legitimately don't know who this is or why she thinks I'm jealous of her. I don't remember ever talking to this person.\"\n\nTurned out she was a lot like your friend. And when one of her floor mates called her out on it she named me specifically as being jealous. I guess we had met at an orientation party. Her story fell apart because the Hall Director was concerned it was a stalking case and she didn't have any of my contact info, nor did I have hers. No third party had ever seen us together and every time she claimed we had hung out I was at sorority events surrounded by people. She was a social pariah for the rest of the year. Not really sure what happened after that because I literally didn't know her.", "NTA oh my goodness, why are you all still friends with this girl???", "She already speaks in the language if Tik Tok therapy, so I don't know if it would be that useful. \n\nThis actually is an interesting question - when people weaponized therapy ideals, how do you reach them outside of that? I'm sure that actual therapists deal with this quite a lot.", "Lol."]}
