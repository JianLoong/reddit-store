She needed a reality check. \n\nNTA", "I think your friend may have a mental health condition. I'm saying this as someone with one too, not as an insult. \n\nOne of my close friends, who has been diagnosed with a condition, had behaviour similar to this when I met her in university. There is a lot of stigma associated with it, and I'm not going to name it because I don't want to put an idea into your head that something like this could be diagnosed by a non-professional and based on so little info - but there are some signs here consistent with what my friend has, now recieves treatment for and manages very well. \n\nThe reason I'm saying this is that it might well be the case that she has something going on, and that talking to her like this won't be the wake up call you might expect. \n\nI'd suggest that you have a few options going forward:\n1) if you are concerned about her or want to preserve the friendship, approach her with empathy and explain clearly to her the impact her behaviour has on you, asking her to be mindful of it when she's around you - listen to her about it too, clear the air\n2) if you can't tolerate it, distance yourself from her for a while\n\nSimply \"calling out\" behaviour like you did isn't an issue in itself, and I feel your frustration with her behaviour through your post, so I don't think you're TA or have done anything wrong. \n\nThere's a much better chance she'd understand and take on board what you are saying if you say it clearly and calmly and focusing on the impact it's having on you. \n\nJust to be clear, in not saying that she has any condition or that you should say this to her or speculate on it with people. I am saying that her behaviour is not normal and she might not be able to understand that, especially if presented with a \"wake up call\" in an emotional situation or in front of people or in a way she feels is a personal attack. Learn from my mistakes - I triggered a shame spiral in my friend that ended up having the opposite result than I wanted when I confronted her about behaviour before. It was a bad time. I've spoken about it with my therapist and learned more about her condition since then. She's put in lots of work too, and now we have good times.", "NTA she's clearly very insecure about her appearance and is over compensating but doing it to the point of invalidating everyone else.", "Not the AH.

For months people would ask me if I was okay because I was supposedly so jealous of this person. \n\nEnded up called into the Residence Hall Advisors office about it. I was like \"I legitimately don't know who this is or why she thinks I'm jealous of her. I don't remember ever talking to this person.\"\n\nTurned out she was a lot like your friend. And when one of her floor mates called her out on it she named me specifically as being jealous. I guess we had met at an orientation party. Her story fell apart because the Hall Director was concerned it was a stalking case and she didn't have any of my contact info, nor did I have hers. No third party had ever seen us together and every time she claimed we had hung out I was at sorority events surrounded by people. She was a social pariah for the rest of the year. Not really sure what happened after that because I literally didn't know her.", "NTA oh my goodness, why are you all still friends with this girl???", "She already speaks in the language if Tik Tok therapy, so I don't know if it would be that useful. \n\nThis actually is an interesting question - when people weaponized therapy ideals, how do you reach them outside of that? I'm sure that actual therapists deal with this quite a lot.", "Lol.", "NTA. Stop hanging out with her. She sounds exhausting.\n\nI knew immediately from the title the ages would be 20 or younger. I tolerated ppl like this in my 20s and it took awhile to learn that those ppl aren't worth the peace of mind they take to be around", "NTA. Your friend has issues. I\u2019m sure she wishes that other women are jealous of her, when in fact she is likely insecure and jealous of others. Sounds like a lot of work that is not reciprocated.", "yep, definitely. Overcompensating much? Lol", "Agreed, I was thinking exactly the same", "I think therapists sometimes frame it as, \"wow, you've done a great job learning the concepts of therapy, but you may be overintellectualizing your experiences, thinking them instead of feeling them. How about we go back to the root of things, like body sensations and emotion words?\"\n\nBecause with the right phrasing, it sounds like they're complimenting the client, while also encouraging the client to drop the vocabulary they're using and work on their shit in a more real way.\n\nEdit: I'm sure sometimes when a therapist says this, they don't have a hidden message! But I've seen two people who were resistant to effective therapy get way more receptive after they got this message, so it seemed to me like a deliberate way to get them to drop their weaponized therapy.", "Same story here. I had only one friend growing up. When I met her again after so many years. She lost weight, she's quite pretty. But she thought everyone is looking at her. I was like embarrassed at first. But I noticed, it's actually her, she looks at men and keep looking till they look back and then she yells \"he is looking at me\". I was super embarrassed many times. Then when she left me,because her bf got to know she was cheating on him and how dare I didn't lie on her behalf and she literally said,\"There is something wrong with you, that's why no guy wants you or look at you. That's why you're single and men only want me.\" I finally said,\"you understand the truth now. Sorry for being so pathetic to be single, now f**k off.\" \ud83d\ude0a\ud83e\udd70 life became peaceful since she left.", "Did it make her uncomfortable?

So for me it was a PTSD response. \n\n(& Yeah I got PTSD in part from how badly I was bullied in school, and honestly thank fuck for therapy and kind people with a lot of patience for my misanthropy at the time because they put me on the path to developing real connections with other humans and healing)\n\nBut, that said, I've seen a lot of narcissistic people and the people who are the absolute *worst* for causing drama say the same, so it's totally valid to take it as a red flag haha.

I'm doing way better than I used to and wasn't fishing for sympathy - more hoping to point out a possible benign explanation for the behaviour because I was totally *that girl* for a lot of my teens and 20s (you know, the one who makes a big show of being antifeminine and preferring to be friends with guys because they're \"less drama\" when being real they absolutely are not?

I felt it was relevant because she wants to undergo an extreme body transformation while also thinking most women are jealous of her body. As for thinking most women probably aren\u2019t jealous of her, I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s a healthy mindset to have. Keep in mind our friend group is all girls and we feel uncomfortable when she implies things like that.. it\u2019s insulting to imply other women are unhappy with themselves and she has something they don\u2019t.\n\nThe weight loss journey has been making her feel more confident but at the same time it\u2019s putting her in a competitive headspace where she thinks others are envious of her.

Which happened to be my weekly meeting for our sorority and a mandatory study time again for the sorority. There was a sign in sheet for both and cameras in the library that showed I was clearly there every week and not with her. \n\nIt was funny when the hall director was like \"well just stay away from her until I can look into this\" and I was like \"I literally do not know how to do that as again I don't know S.\"", "Hahahaha. That's amazing. Luckily you seem pretty chill, so that's good. And yeah the making floor mates crazy also takes away her \"credibility\" so by then they were probably fed up anyway. \nShe probably realized the \"they're jealous of me\" stopped working so she resorted to saying you stalked her.
