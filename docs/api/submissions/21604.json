This is about my oldest daughter. Before the lockdown, my daughter was very athletic, took care of herself, had amazing grades, and all-around cared about herself and her looks. During lockdown that all changed, we all gained weight from just sitting around and doing nothing so I decided that this needed to change so in late 2021 I decided to make healthier (still delicious) meals for my family and encouraged my kids to be more active. This was incredibly easy for my twins because they have so much energy. They would accompany me on my daily walks and they loved playing in our front or backyard.

At the end of 2022, I stopped trying because she's 17, turning 18 this year but now she has been making really rude comments about me. When she sees me working out she will comment rude things about my form and how I looked in my workout clothes. She also makes rude comments when I'm eating because I don't eat huge portions anymore. The rude comments have gotten me to the point that I am happy when she's with her dad so I can do my routine in peace. Yesterday, it was my twin's birthday and I got myself a small piece of cake because the cake my kids chose wasn't my favorite, and my daughter told me \"No matter how little cake I eat, I'll always be big\". I was shocked when she said this and I was upset and at my breaking point so I finally said \"You need to work through your insecurities and start taking care of yourself instead of projecting them on me\". She ended up having a soured attitude all night and in the end called her dad to pick her up which resulted in me getting yelled at by him and called \"a bad mom\".

She feels bad about herself so she is trying to make others feel bad aboth *themselves*.\n\nSomething else may be going on besides being overweight. Being overweight may be a symptom. You / her father should try talking to her and see if something has happened or if she is struggling mentally / emotionally.", "NTA\n\nYou are right. At some point, she has to stop projecting on others.", "I don't think what you said was too harsh or out of line.  I'm more concerned that you never mentioned whether or not she is in any kind of therapy.  Many people still struggled mentally from the pandemic and are having a difficult time \"getting back to normal.\"  I understand she is almost 18, but you can still help her to seek some therapy, especially because you actually see the drastic change in her.  I get you changed everyone's diet, tried to get her to be active, etc., but none of that has helped, so take the time now to find a good therapist for her.  NTA", "NTA. You are right, and you should maybe try to get your daughter in therapy because she seems to be struggling.", "Idk I feel like your daughter is going through something and maybe you haven\u2019t been there for her. Eshhh because we all have a breaking point", "NTA. Your daughter is definitely struggling.", "ESH. I totally get why you snapped, because nobody can take negative comments constantly without eventually snapping.\n\nHowever, you don't mention in your post even attempting to talk with your daughter. It's possible that she's suffering from health conditions--whether physical, mental, or a combination of both--and you're her parent. It sounds like you tried your best to do diet and exercise, but you gave up when the two low hanging fruits of weight loss didn't work.\n\nWhen lockdown started, your daughter would've been at the age where mensuration begins. And that is often when hormonal issues--or other chronic conditions--begin happening. I, for example, got absolutely destroyed by endometritis as a teenager, which disguised my other two chronic pain conditions (a dislocated hip from an untreated sports injury and celiac) because the endometritis symptoms disguised the other two.\n\nYour daughter is being a dick, but that's what teenagers do. It's your responsibility to figure out what is causing her to be so miserable  she's actively lashing out.", "NTA. She's 17, she's at that stage in life where everything sucks especially Mom's. Sorry but she'll grow out of it.", "NTA, if your narrative is accurate.  A lot people lost their routines and healthy habits during the pandemic and never fully got them back.\n\nShe is projecting and that is not fair to you.  If you have left details out... this could go to E-S-H or Y-T-A quite quick.", "Nta", "NTA, but it sounds like your daughter is really struggling. The pandemic was hard on a lot of kiddos and to me it sounds like your daughter really thrived at school and to have that all taken away during such formative years really took a toll. \n\nI would recommend therapy for her and maybe some more one on one time with you and her.", "YTA/ E S H\n\n1) She needs to stop making rude comments about your working out and eating habits.\n\nHOWEVER\n\n2) You do project, even in this post, a judgmental attitude about your daughter's weight. The lockdown was severely mentally damaging to teenagers, sometimes moreso than adults due to the lack of ability to socialize at a key developmental time for socializing. It makes total sense that she would struggle to lose weight after going through something like that. She's also not wrong that there could be many reasons she isn't losing weight that don't involve her not \"taking care of herself.\" As the adult, you do bear more of a responsibility for this than your child because she is a child who needs help processing the traumas of the lockdown and the issues involving her weight. It is harder to lose weight when you're depressed or anxious, not because of willpower but because the body doesn't lose weight as quickly when you've got an excess of stress hormones such as cortisol in your body. You need to get your child therapy rather than judging her about her weight. I do think it's awesome that you've started cooking healthier meals for your family, but there's more to \"taking care of yourself\" than eating right and exercising.", "NTA \n\nYou are absolutely right. She does need to work on herself and stop projecting. Possibly, you need to tell her she isn\u2019t allowed to make comments like that to you anymore. She will be 18 soon\u2026..", "Almost E-S-H but I'm more toward YTA.  You're the mom.  You should be helping her out here more.  Has she been to the doctor to be checked for any issues that might cause weight gain or trouble losing weight?   These type of issues usually develop puberty, especially PCOS and thyroid issues.  Have you tried seeing a nutritionist with her to help her understand how to eat healthier?  \n\nHow has she been impacted because of the twins and her step father?    It seems like we're missing some details here like you and her bio dad are divorced and split custody.  How long has this been?  How does she eat with her father?  How does she feel about all this?\n\nShe sucks for continuing to make rude comments but you didn't say if you did anything to address it.", "ESH. You picked the wrong moment to snap. She has been being an AH to you, but that particular comment sounds like she was expressing hopelessness about her own situation. Society is really hard on women about our weight, and as a teenager who has just gained a lot of weight she is probably feeling a lot of frustration and shame about it. She\u2019s comparing herself to you and being mean about it, which is crappy\u2026 but, teenagers are crappy. Your job is to be the patient and mature one. Don\u2019t accept her rude comments, but don\u2019t lose your temper or say things that put her down. Consider speaking to a nutritionist or her doctor about evidence-based ways to support her health.", "YTA Lockdown was really tough on kids instead of answering back to your child you should have used it as an opportunity to ask her if she\u2019s ok because she obviously isn\u2019t. \n\nThe fact that everyone has gone back to healthy habits and she hasn\u2019t been able to should have been a red flag to you. You said she took care of herself and now she doesn\u2019t do the things she likes that would hint at some sort of low level depression at the very least.\n\nYou have been so self-absorbed you are completely oblivious to the fact your daughter is struggling with mental health. Do you perhaps enjoy being slimmer than her? Does it make you feel younger? Her attitude is screaming PLEASE HELP ME but all you are worried about is if you fit in smaller clothes.", "YTA.  She obviously has been having issues adjusting for a while.  Why on earth haven\u2019t you asked her if she wants to see a therapist?  You are supposed to be the parent here and parents are supposed to help their kids.  Changing meals and exercising worked for you, but that doesn\u2019t mean it will work for her mental health.", "Agree especially #2. Also would add very often people think they are being nonjudgmental and supportive but come across differently to the receiver. Sounds like the daughter feels badly about her self-image: where is this coming from? If it\u2019s not the mom, then is another friend or relative saying something to her?", "ESH. Your daughter is being an absolute pill no doubt about it but it clearly is covering for other issues. You tell her to work on her insecurities but she is 17 - she is going to need help to get there. You should get her a therapist to talk to about her body issues and potential depression based on how you describe her behaviors. Yelling at her to just address it herself is a bit harsh and really difficult at her age if she has never faced mental health challenges before. Your whole family (ex, daughter and you) need to be better about open communication and supporting each other.", "YTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If she\u2019s slipping into a state of abject despair about her health/looks, parent her. You sound like you\u2019ve already written her off.

She needed to set a boundary and while I agree that it would have been preferable for her to start a discussion at a time other than a birthday party, I don't find myself judging harshly.
