This is about my oldest daughter. Before the lockdown, my daughter was very athletic, took care of herself, had amazing grades, and all-around cared about herself and her looks. During lockdown that all changed, we all gained weight from just sitting around and doing nothing so I decided that this needed to change so in late 2021 I decided to make healthier (still delicious) meals for my family and encouraged my kids to be more active. This was incredibly easy for my twins because they have so much energy. They would accompany me on my daily  they loved playing in our front or backyard. By the middle of 2022, my husband, and the twins were back at our pre-lockdown weight and I even was smaller than before. Nothing about my daughter changed and it seemed she got bigger which affected her tremendously. \n\nIn my house, we still have a few unhealthy snacks cause I don't wanna deprive them. At the end of 2022, I stopped trying because she's 17, turning 18 this year but now she has been making really rude comments about me. When she sees me working out she will comment rude things about my form and how I looked in my workout clothes. She also makes rude comments when I'm eating because I don't eat huge portions anymore. The rude comments have gotten me to the point that I am happy when she's with her dad so I can do my routine in peace. Yesterday, it was my twin's birthday and I got myself a small piece of cake because the cake my kids chose wasn't my favorite, and my daughter told me \"No matter how little cake I eat, I'll always be big\". I was shocked when she said this and I was upset and at my breaking point so I finally said \"You need to work through your insecurities and start taking care of yourself instead of projecting them on me\". She ended up having a soured attitude all night and in the end called her dad to pick her up which resulted in me getting yelled at by him and called \"a bad mom\". So REDDIT AITA?\n\nEdit: A lot of people think that I'm just mixing up my daughter's words. What I quoted in my story is exactly what she said. No words were changed. The comment was directed towards me, not herself. Another thing people say is that I care more about losing weight and being smaller than my daughter then her mental health. Am I supposed to be bigger than my daughter just so she feels better? Me losing weight has nothing to do with her but my OWN health. During lockdown, I was considered OBESE. I decided to make a change and now I'm considered a very healthy weight for my age and height.\n\nAnother thing is that my daughter has a therapist. She's had one since lockdown.\n\nANOTHER THING! I'm not an almond mom! I love me some pop tarts or some goldfish. I still eat these things but in moderation. My kids have all their favorite snacks in my house.\n\nAlso, for the people saying I'm fat phobic, I'm not. What parent would want their child to be at an unhealthy weight? My oldest child is 4'11 \"and over 200 pounds. She is considered obesed. It's not healthy growing up weight but being completely unhealthy. I'm allowed to change things around my house so my family is healthy.", "created_utc": 1688756277, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14tfzxd/aita_for_my_daughter_she_needs_to_work_through/", "score": 491, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

At some point, she has to stop projecting on others.", "I don't think what you said was too harsh or out of line.  I'm more concerned that you never mentioned whether or not she is in any kind of therapy.  Many people still struggled mentally from the pandemic and are having a difficult time \"getting back to normal.\"  I understand she is almost 18, but you can still help her to seek some therapy, especially because you actually see the drastic change in her.  I get you changed everyone's diet, tried to get her to be active, etc., but none of that has helped, so take the time now to find a good therapist for her.  NTA", "NTA. You are right, and you should maybe try to get your daughter in therapy because she seems to be struggling.", "Idk I feel like your daughter is going through something and maybe you haven\u2019t been there for her. Eshhh because we all have a breaking point", "NTA. Your daughter is definitely struggling.", "ESH. I totally get why you snapped, because nobody can take negative comments constantly without eventually snapping.\n\nHowever, you don't mention in your post even attempting to talk with your daughter. It's possible that she's suffering from health conditions--whether physical, mental, or a combination of both--and you're her parent. It sounds like you tried your best to do diet and exercise, but you gave up when the two low hanging fruits of weight loss didn't work.\n\nWhen lockdown started, your daughter would've been at the age where mensuration begins. And that is often when hormonal issues--or other chronic conditions--begin happening. I, for example, got absolutely destroyed by endometritis as a teenager, which disguised my other two chronic pain conditions (a dislocated hip from an untreated sports injury and celiac) because the endometritis symptoms disguised the other two.\n\nYour daughter is being a dick, but that's what teenagers do. It's your responsibility to figure out what is causing her to be so miserable  she's actively lashing out.", "NTA. She's 17, she's at that stage in life where everything sucks especially Mom's. Sorry but she'll grow out of it.", "NTA, if your narrative is accurate.  A lot people lost their routines and healthy habits during the pandemic and never fully got them back.\n\nShe is projecting and that is not fair to you.  If you have left details out... this could go to E-S-H or Y-T-A quite quick.", "Nta", "NTA, but it sounds like your daughter is really struggling. The pandemic was hard on a lot of kiddos and to me it sounds like your daughter really thrived at school and to have that all taken away during such formative years really took a toll. \n\nI would recommend therapy for her and maybe some more one on one time with you and her.", "YTA/ E S H\n\n1) She needs to stop making rude comments about your working out and eating habits.\n\nHOWEVER\n\n2) You do project, even in this post, a judgmental attitude about your daughter's weight. The lockdown was severely mentally damaging to teenagers, sometimes moreso than adults due to the lack of ability to socialize at a key developmental time for socializing. It makes total sense that she would struggle to lose weight after going through something like that. She's also not wrong that there could be many reasons she isn't losing weight that don't involve her not \"taking care of herself.\" As the adult, you do bear more of a responsibility for this than your child because she is a child who needs help processing the traumas of the lockdown and the issues involving her weight. It is harder to lose weight when you're depressed or anxious, not because of willpower but because the body doesn't lose weight as quickly when you've got an excess of stress hormones such as cortisol in your body. You need to get your child therapy rather than judging her about her weight. I do think it's awesome that you've started cooking healthier meals for your family, but there's more to \"taking care of yourself\" than eating right and exercising.", "NTA \n\nYou are absolutely right. She does need to work on herself and stop projecting. Possibly, you need to tell her she isn\u2019t allowed to make comments like that to you anymore. She will be 18 soon\u2026..", "Almost E-S-H but I'm more toward YTA.  You're the mom.  You should be helping her out here more.  Has she been to the doctor to be checked for any issues that might cause weight gain or trouble losing weight?   These type of issues usually develop puberty, especially PCOS and thyroid issues.  Have you tried seeing a nutritionist with her to help her understand how to eat healthier?  \n\nHow has she been impacted because of the twins and her step father?    It seems like we're missing some details here like you and her bio dad are divorced and split custody.  How long has this been?  How does she eat with her father?  How does she feel about all this?\n\nShe sucks for continuing to make rude comments but you didn't say if you did anything to address it.", "ESH. You picked the wrong moment to snap. She has been being an AH to you, but that particular comment sounds like she was expressing hopelessness about her own situation. Society is really hard on women about our weight, and as a teenager who has just gained a lot of weight she is probably feeling a lot of frustration and shame about it. She\u2019s comparing herself to you and being mean about it, which is crappy\u2026 but, teenagers are crappy. Your job is to be the patient and mature one. Don\u2019t accept her rude comments, but don\u2019t lose your temper or say things that put her down. Consider speaking to a nutritionist or her doctor about evidence-based ways to support her health.", "YTA Lockdown was really tough on kids instead of answering back to your child you should have used it as an opportunity to ask her if she\u2019s ok because she obviously isn\u2019t. \n\nThe fact that everyone has gone back to healthy habits and she hasn\u2019t been able to should have been a red flag to you. You said she took care of herself and now she doesn\u2019t do the things she likes that would hint at some sort of low level depression at the very least.\n\nYou have been so self-absorbed you are completely oblivious to the fact your daughter is struggling with mental health. Do you perhaps enjoy being slimmer than her? Does it make you feel younger? Her attitude is screaming PLEASE HELP ME but all you are worried about is if you fit in smaller clothes.", "YTA.  She obviously has been having issues adjusting for a while.  Why on earth haven\u2019t you asked her if she wants to see a therapist?  You are supposed to be the parent here and parents are supposed to help their kids.  Changing meals and exercising worked for you, but that doesn\u2019t mean it will work for her mental health.", "Agree especially #2. Also would add very often people think they are being nonjudgmental and supportive but come across differently to the receiver. Sounds like the daughter feels badly about her self-image: where is this coming from? If it\u2019s not the mom, then is another friend or relative saying something to her?", "ESH. Your daughter is being an absolute pill no doubt about it but it clearly is covering for other issues. You tell her to work on her insecurities but she is 17 - she is going to need help to get there. You should get her a therapist to talk to about her body issues and potential depression based on how you describe her behaviors. Yelling at her to just address it herself is a bit harsh and really difficult at her age if she has never faced mental health challenges before. Your whole family (ex, daughter and you) need to be better about open communication and supporting each other.", "YTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This unfortunately happens I experienced a similar situation with a friend of mine I had for years, we aren\u2019t friends anymore apparently me eating healthy and exercising made her feel bad so I wasn\u2019t allowed to talk about the gym when she asked about my day, she made comments about me being privileged I could have so much self control, how all I eat is healthy food and proposed the idea I had an eating disorder\u2026 I was actually recovering from an eating disorder. I suggest you put your daughter into therapy she\u2019s still a kid and she\u2019s dealing with complex issues like body image issues and maybe even depression from them and she probably needs her mum a lot right now.", "I don't understand why you are saying that she was talking about you when she said, \n\n\"No matter how little cake I eat, I'll always be big\"\n\nThat is first person singular.  Seems more like she is crying out for help.", "You say she has a therapist.  That therapist doesn\u2019t seem to be helping.  Have you tried family therapy?\n\nESH, but here\u2019s a suggestion.  Ask your daughter to take a short walk with you.  Not an exercise walk, but a \u201cwalk and talk\u201d.  Two people facing forward have a different conversation than face to face.  Just a short walk, as often as she will commit, maybe to hear one of her favorite songs. Or see the flowers.  Or even to an ice cream place.  Just a walk.  Get in the habit of walking and taking.  See what happens.", "NTA\n\nProlly gunna get burned for this but o-well. Op is human and we make mistakes. Could they have worded it better, yes. Was it harsh? No. Was it blunt? Yes. \n\nIf my kid had been nagging at me for months, I'd lose my temper a bit as well. Daughter is 17, that's old enough to understand feelings and how words can hurt. She's not 5. \n\nQuite frankly, OP chose the most direct way to approach it but in the heat of the moment, how many people could calmly and eloquently perform \"story book mom\" in the face of such rude comments? Kid gotta learn that some people will respond with words and others violence. We love our children and suffer through our kids' worst moments but the world does not have to. The world won't be as kind as mom with her blunt words. The world may or may not have a fist or even a brick to the face. Let's be real here.", "NTA what she said was completely out of line. She has a therapist obviously she needs to talk to them more.", "Don't apologize for teaching kids to eat healthy.  People are ridiculous.", "NTA.", "NTA - have you had her hormones tested? She\u2019s at an age where some health issues kick in that only affect women which a sign is her weight and even the drastic attitude change could be attributed to that. \n\nIt sounds like you\u2019ve given her a lot of resources and offer a space where she can feel safe to exercise and explore those options. Being a mom is hard - especially to a teen who\u2019s going thru it.", "I think it could have been worded better. Perhaps something like:\n\n\"Sweetie, I'm concerned. You keep making negative comments, not only about me but about yourself. To me that's a sign that you feel bad, and that makes me sad. You have your whole life ahead of you and I want to make sure it's a good life. I'd like to think you can talk to me about whatever is bugging you, but we can get you a counsellor if you would prefer. I really think you'd benefit from working through whatever is making you feel bad.\n\nBut there is one thing I do want to address. No matter how bad you may be feeling, it's still not ok to make personal comments about other people, including me. It's unfortunately pretty common that people who feel bad try to make others feel bad as well, but it's still not OK.\n\nEtc.\"", "Also check her hormones. Teenage girls and weight gain can be very tied to hormones which can also affect mood.", "You need to get your child therapy rather than judging her about her weight.", "These type of issues usually develop puberty, especially PCOS and thyroid issues.", "Menstruation begins before 14 A LOT of the time... I know I am only one person, but I started when I was 11 so imo this is a weird take. OP, any info on this?", ">When lockdown started, your daughter would've been at the age where mensuration begins.\n\nThat is quite an assumption. Especially since it's not even true of the average. The first think that comes up when I googled when does menstruation begin\n\n>**Periods usually begin at around the age of 12**. Some girls will start them later, and some earlier \u2013 everyone is different.\n\nOn the NHS website.\n\nAll the rest about actually talking to the daughter yeah", "A 14 year old commencing menstruation these days is extremely late. That was the average thirty years ago, the average age now is something like 11.8", "Honestly why are we telling a 36yo that they have to .... *checks notes * parent? \n\nKid's lashing out because OP probably isn't as kind to her daughter as she's putting it here. \n\nI used to nanny and honestly? I watched this happen multiple times in families where the parents didn't take responsibility for how their language around food increases shame for young women in particular, and turned around and solely blamed those young women for feeling insecure in a home that's stripping them further of their safety. \n\nThis should be YTA because no, no parent should be their child's bully, no matter how the KID, STILL SEVENTEEN, lashes out.", "I agree with everything here, except you are definitely NTA... yet. You might start heading down that road if you don't talk to a professional about how best to handle this. It's definitely time at least for you. It may also be time for your daughter and/or her father to talk to professionals, also.", "Ya I felt a lot of judgement from the mom to daughter. I\u2019m sure if we got the daughters POV it would be eye opening.", "If she needs to stop making rude comments then she is an AH too", "Omg the nutritionist thing. I\u2019m 31 and just saw a nutritionist this year for health issues. She gave me such great info about foods that wasn\u2019t easily accessible online. They\u2019re so awesome. And I can\u2019t believe they don\u2019t teach basic nutrition in schools in a way to make kids understand what is actually healthy and not good for their changing bodies. OUR changing bodies since we keep changing even in adulthood!", "She's 4'11\" and *over 200 lbs*. This is beyond normal changes.", "How can she be an \"almond mom\" if she keeps junk food in the house and eats it herself?", "If you have no curiosity as to why she's feeling this way, she is going to try to act out to get your attention, even if it's negative attention.", "That is a very rational and calm response which we be great. Getting that out calmly and nicely after the kids comment would be very difficult for me to do lol.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth it sounds like the kid has a counselor already", "Agreed! Overweight my entire life, severely depressed as a teenager. Turns out I have pcos and insulin resistance :/", "oh stop that right now. girls and hormones are not an excuse to act like that.", "Daughter has been in therapy since the pandemic.", "the daughter is already in therapy according to OP. sorry to be the one to tell you this, therapy is not a magical fix-all where people magically stop misbehaving.", "Yup. My PCOS started when I was 18.", "Menstruation beings before 14 *on average*. 12 is the average age according to the NHS. So yeah it's a weird take.", "Yeah, mine began at 11 but puberty doesn't end for several years after that. My point is, a lot of chronic conditions really take off when the individual hits puberty. Especially if the kid's issues are related to ovarian cysts, the covid pandemic's lockdown period would coincide with PCOS starting to bother her.", "What part of telling the kid to work on her own insecurities, \u201cstart taking care of yourself instead of protecting them on me\u201d is bullying?", "Oh and I re-read it to be sure but she says unhealthy snacks, we assume it\u2019s junk food but again if it\u2019s an almond mom it\u2019s gunna be something like sugar free cookies or granola.", "We don\u2019t know what she considers junk food. It could be smart pop or something that the majority of people wouldn\u2019t think is junk food.", "They\u2019re talking about health conditions like PCOS, not being sexist", "I started at 10. And even then menstruation is not to blame for her attitude. Nta", "or maybe she's a kid who ate too much because of lockdown and is acting shitty about it. why are we making up stories about her?", "The \"start taking care of yourself-\" part. You can take care of yourself and still be fat.", "But nothing insinuates that OP is an \"almond mom.\"", "this whole comment section is littered with people trying to blame it on her period or hormones. it's so sexist to say she can't just be a kid acting shitty.", "True, but you\u2019re not taking care of yourself if you\u2019re lashing out at those around you.", "I think the way she talks about weight and taking care of yourself does. Saying before her daughter all around cared about herself and her looks but implies that now she doesn\u2019t, just seems to be based on weight. She could be bigger and still care  about herself and her looks. Thinner doesn\u2019t mean better but the way op writes she implies that. The fact she didn\u2019t lose weight and perhaps gained it doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t care about her looks. Do you see my point ? It\u2019s hard to explain the feeling her word choice generates"]}
