Feeding addictions are the canonical example of what economists call \u201cInelastic Demand\u201d, meaning they need to have what they\u2019re addicted to, and if prices go up, they\u2019ll still pay. I mention this because you seem to be thinking about her smoking as something she can quit any time she wants to, and that makes her choices really confusing to you. I think you\u2019d have a much easier time understanding her behavior if you thought of it more like alcohol. You knew her when she drank - could she quit drinking because it wasn\u2019t in the budget?\n\nI think your frustration is valid.

Especially considering you have two dependant children.\n\nSomething I feel like I need to mention is the damage second-hand smoke does to developing children. Children raised in a home with a smoker are at \\~4x likely to become addicted to tabaco themselves. And, which I can attest to through personal experience, growing up in an environment with a lot of carcinogenic airborne particles is linked to a increased chance of developing lung damage or asthma in young children's developing lungs. I know you said that \"I wouldn't make someone quit because i think its unhealthy and bad\", but maybe you should consider it. Smoking isn't just a personal choice when it hurts the people around you.

We've got a partner with congestive heart failure who couldn't come, another relative with  COPD/emphysema, several cancers the probability of which were raised by smoking, and you could see the difference in ageing and health between those who smoked (even if they'd quit) and those who never smoked.

The addiction to nicotine is as powerful as any narcotic. \n\nIt just happens to be legal and to have been acceptable in modern society for a very long time, even if it's becoming less so in recent years.\n\nI don't think that OP should even go in, all guns blazing, pushing for his partner to quit completely.\n\nI've seen that smokers can only quit when they make the decision for themselves when they are ready.\n\nSmoking is often a form of self-medication for many things. It can be a crutch that enables people to function in their daily lives and they don't even realise it because often, they started smoking very young and because so many other people around them also smoke.\n\nFor OP's partner to give up smoking, she doesn't just have to face and withdraw from her addiction, she also has to face up to all the ways she believes it has been helping her get through each day, whether it's helping her get started in the morning, feel calmer, feel less anxious, feel instantly part of the group in a social situation, and so on. \n\nOP can talk to her about finding ways to help her cut back on how much she smokes.\n\nThey can look up local resources for stopping smoking - even if that isn't the current goal, they will find support for managing moments that trigger the urge to spark up, how to manage the need to have something to do with your hands, advice on nicotine replacement patches etc.\n\nI know this is the US so you guys may not have easy access to affordable healthcare but if by any chance you do, there is medical support available for stopping smoking, including meds, not just patches.\n\nA long time ago, when my oldest daughter's dad and I were similarly broke, he switched to rolling his own. It was cheaper just broken down by weight but also, each one he made ended up being smaller anyway so the tobacco lasted even longer and when things got really tight, he could eke it out even further.\n\nThen there's vaping, which is another way to slowly taper off but comes with its own set of traps to fall into, so be wary too.\n\nEven just working together to create a basic tapering plan that's something like:\n\nWeek 1: 20 a day\nWeek 2: 17 a day\nWeek 3: 15 a day\nWeek 4: 12 a day\nand so on.\n\nEach step has to be something that she feels comfortable with. She needs to understand that if she 'breaks the diet' on any one day, it's fine, and there's no shame. She just carries on the next day, sticking to that week's target.\n\nMaybe she might need to start off with two week stretches before stepping down.\n\nOP would need to understand that there will be days when she'll go over the number but that the aim is to bring the trend downwards not to be extremely rigid.\n\nIf they want to try this, they should also be looking at strategies for managing the 'what to do with my hands' now issue and new methods for managing stress and anxiety, and new routines to replacing smoking at her favourite times of the day to smoke.\n\nHopefully, if the plan worked well enough to get down to under 10 a day, from where they are now, then they would have a much better understanding of what works to help her and what doesn't.\n\nBut the last few may well also be the hardest to let go of. So just be prepared for that too.\n\nIt may take a few attempts to let go of them.\n\nShe's not a failure if she can't do it the first time around.", "Idk where you live, but in the meantime definitely look into food pantries/shelves if possible!

I'm not sure it is wise to rely on this person for housing costs.", "I\u2019m not going to be as kind as you have been, OP. Give this woman an ultimatum and give her one now. She either quits smoking and agrees to seek help, or you leave with the kids. \n\nShe is choosing cigarettes over the health and well-being of her children. Her habit is placing them at risk of harm, actual neglect and potential homelessness. \n\nYou are a saint to have put up with this for as long as you have. But it is time to place your children before their mother. It\u2019s a terrible decision but one you need to make. \n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nShe has to cut back or you need to break up. She cannot spend income on addiction that\u2019s needed for food and housing.\n\nShe can switch to a cheaper brand, she can roll her own, she can look into vaping, but this cannot continue.\n\nMy guess is she\u2019s switched from alcohol to smoking. My other guess is that smoking is a mental transition for her. Before a task, or at the end of one, she uses smoking as a way to transition into/away from that mindset. Finding something else to take that time\u2014whether it\u2019s standing outside or chewing gum or listening to a song with headphones\u2014is necessary.", "NTA \n\nBut FYI your math is wrong.  A pack of cigarettes by me is 18$ I'll round down for 15 (easy maths) and I do know they vary by region.\n\n2.5 packs/day assuming 30 days a month that's 75 packs per month   75*15 is 1125/month.  Assuming bi weekly pay that's 575 conservatively.  Again varies by region but your wife ciggs are essentially 75% of your entire rent pamm", "NTA. \n\nShe\u2019s swapped one substance use disorder (alcohol) for another (nicotine). Both of these happen to be legal substances, but she\u2019s got the same relationship to them that a person might have to opioids, crack, etc. She feels she can\u2019t function without them (smoking before caring for the kids) and she\u2019s willing to borrow money and potentially lose your shared home rather than cutting back or stopping. \n\nI work with and care about folks with substance use disorder (alcohol and pills, mostly) and it\u2019s really hard to watch folks struggle with this. I don\u2019t have a great solution for you, but the fact is that she\u2019s risking making your family homeless. I think you need to decide if you want to work with her to cut back on her smoking or if you want to bail out of the relationship. I know it\u2019s more complicated when kids are involved, but she is consistently putting her habit ahead of their needs, so leaving until she sorts herself out might be the best thing for them, too.", "She wanna speedrun lung cancer?", "Is she in AA? If not, she needs it. She is replacing one habit with another, which isn't healthy.\n\nAddiction is a fight she will fight for the rest of her life, but she needs to do it. She needs to realize this smoking habit is just as bad.\n\nI am not sure if you haven't already done it, but I would make an itemized list and show her how much you guys are drowning. You need to make it real for her.\n\nNTA \n\nYou got kids to take care of", "NTA, there\u2019s no difference between alcohol, cigarettes, drugs, overspending, over eating or gambling dude. When it gets this bad she needs to get help. She\u2019s not thinking clearly (insane some would say) and won\u2019t be able to stop this alone. If she\u2019s a recovering alcoholic then this is something her sponsor, assuming she has one, should already be addressing as well.", "NTA, for sure. As someone who quit cigarettes completely last year, I would see if she is willing to try alternatives to cigarettes. \n\nFor me, I ended up moving to Zyn pouches. They are little packets of nicotine salt, no tobacco or anything, and are applied to the gums. They come in different strengths of nicotine content and are cheaper than cigs these days, but that can still be pretty expensive, depending on how much she would go through.\n\nIdk where you reside, but I know in Colorado, you can get a can of zyn pouches (15 pouches in each can) for roughly $5-$6, and that's for a higher nicotine content (6 mg). Usually, if you go to a 7-11 and buy them, they give you a discount for buying 2, I think it is like $1 or 2 off for every 2 cans you buy.  \n\nI will say if you try this, she will miss the burning sensation that smoking gives you. That is the hardest hurdle to go over when switching to ZYNs, IMO, but it is feasible.\n\nKeep in mind, though, I'm not well versed on the side effects myself, but I would imagine that they can negatively affect the gums. \n\nI hope this was helpful, and good luck to you.", "NTA\n\nThis is complicated because cigarettes are literally addicting, plus she has an addictive personality so she's going to latch on to *something*, and you guys live a high stress life, which these help with.\n\nBut, if you don't have the money, you don't have the money.\n\nPlease make sure you are signed up for every program you are eligible for. SNAP, EBT, housing vouchers, the whole shebang, and there is absolutely no shame in going to a food bank.", "Maybe she could start rolling her own? The inconvenience and different taste might help her gradually smoke less. It\u2019s significantly cheaper than buying Camels etc. Good luck!", "Info- you both work and split all bills, or are one of you the breadwinner?", "I feel like rolling your own could also be helpful as the preparation process seems like it could be a little bit soothing and meditative - as she hopefully then starts to step down it might be helpful to use fidget toys to stimulate that same soothing feeling to help with the process.\n\nNot a doctor or a smoker, so I may be completely off base.", "That's an insane amount of cigarettes a day. Maybe I'm sheltered but how can someone smoke that much? That's like 3 an hour (for a 16 hour day) or one every 20 minutes consistently.\n\nHoly shit. That's not even living life, that's living for the next smoke."]}
