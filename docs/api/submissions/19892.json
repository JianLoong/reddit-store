So voicing your opinion is perfectly fair in this scenario as long as you remember that it isn\u2019t as simple as \u201cjust stop smoking.\u201d I wish her the best with recovering.", "NTA, I use to smoke 40 a day and now I mainly vape after quitting for 2 years. If she\u2019s putting cigarettes before food or rent then she needs to see a professional because there is a bigger underlying issue there", "NTA. Yes it\u2019s an addiction but it\u2019s not an excuse. You have every right to be upset with her for how she is spending not just her money but money that\u2019s supposed to help support your children. \n\nWithout professional help it\u2019s only going to get worse. She traded one vice for another. She\u2019s putting her addiction above everything else in her life including her family and basic necessities.", "NTA. She needs to realize get priorities and like you said, feeding the children and being able to get to work are above smoking. \nMaybe challenge her to a single pack a week for starters.\nYou may have to make threats that you can backup otherwise.", "Your partner sounds like an addict. Feeding addictions are the canonical example of what economists call \u201cInelastic Demand\u201d, meaning they need to have what they\u2019re addicted to, and if prices go up, they\u2019ll still pay. I mention this because you seem to be thinking about her smoking as something she can quit any time she wants to, and that makes her choices really confusing to you. I think you\u2019d have a much easier time understanding her behavior if you thought of it more like alcohol. You knew her when she drank - could she quit drinking because it wasn\u2019t in the budget?\n\nI think your frustration is valid. Addicts spending critical family resources to feed their addiction is a story as old as addiction. You\u2019re left with some very hard choices. \n\nI think the way you understand her maybe needs some work. But I think you\u2019re earnest and trying. So NTA.", "NTA. \n\nBut YWBTA if you choose your relationship over your children. She has proven that she does not put them first. It is nice to think that with nagging she will change. She might. Or might not. \n\nFact is that your childrens needs (home, food, transportation) are in danger because you are choosing to depend on the income of someone unreliable. Do not do this. You fail your kids by relying on her for income right now. She is just to untrustworthy for that. She should provide her share but fact is that she does not. And your kids deserve that that that share is picked up. So, pick it up.\n\nI don't know how you are going to do it, but make all changes necessary to be financially independent. Deep clense your budget. Cut out all unnecessary spending on your end. Talk to your boss how your paycheck does not cover your bills. Try to move to cheaper living, or get a roommate. Watch some budgettering youtube channels. Live by the \"there is always a cheaper option somehow\"-motto. Just make the finances work.\n\nYour children deserve a home and food. Don't you dare prioritize anything else.", "My girlfriend was like this when we met.  I got her into vaping, which saved me a bit of money.  Then after the cig cravings subsided a little I was able to help her quit all together.  maybe a similar approach could help you financially?", "NTA for sure. You two need to come up with a plan on how to spend your money and how to divide up expenses. IMHO the best way is by income. If you both earn the same, you both contribute equally to the shared expenses- rent, food, utilities, kids things. Money left over is available for personal things like coffin nails.\n\nIf one earns more, that person contributes more. One earns twice as much , that person pays 2/3 of the shared expenses.\n\nIf she refuses to be responsible, grab the kids and leave.", "NTA smoking is disgusting and expensive but why not vape it's cheaper and can work on reducing nicotine", "NTA - You can\u2019t force her to quit, but you can definitely show her the numbers and ask her to cut back", "NTA\n\nBut\u2026 the problem with an addiction is that people usually use more when they get stressed. And nagging ads stress, so your efforts here likely have a negative effect on what you hope to achieve. \n\nInstead of trying to talk her into quitting, I think it may be more effective to try and talk her into finding help with cutting down (I\u2019m sure you can find free programs online), or trying to talk her into vaping (which is a lot cheaper) instead.", "NTA, she\u2019s wasting your money on absolute garbage that does nothing but harm. Cigarette use kills more per year than covid for the entire pandemic. Priorities!", "Nta. There's a difference between forcing her to stop and cutting down and it's effecting your life.\nI'd give her a portion of the bills, she has to be responsible for paying and I mean put it on her name. And she can bail herself out then. Might shock her rather than you picking up the pieces", "NTA for setting boundary. Are the asshole for thinking you get to \u2018dictate\u2019 as you wrote in title. Move on if you aren\u2019t happy!", "Put a patch on her! Jesus. NTA. I agree with the other poster, her problem is bigger than cigarettes if she will spend rent money on them.\n\nI used to be a committed pack a day smoker.\n\nI'd roll my own before I'd endanger my bill money.\n\nIf you're in a position to lay down any laws, law down that law.

We join assets and I pay the bills.  He gets an allowance for cigs and fast food or whatever else each week.

NTA", "Very much NTA.\n\nEnsuring you have a home, food, and financial stability are pretty much the plain basics to quality of life. Without these things, it's not going to be pretty. Especially considering you have two dependant children.\n\nSomething I feel like I need to mention is the damage second-hand smoke does to developing children. Children raised in a home with a smoker are at \\~4x likely to become addicted to tabaco themselves. And, which I can attest to through personal experience, growing up in an environment with a lot of carcinogenic airborne particles is linked to a increased chance of developing lung damage or asthma in young children's developing lungs. I know you said that \"I wouldn't make someone quit because i think its unhealthy and bad\", but maybe you should consider it. Smoking isn't just a personal choice when it hurts the people around you. Not to mention, of all the ex-smokers in my life, I am yet to meet one that regrets quitting, so your fianc\u00e9 probably isn't going to hate you for trying to help her once she is on the recovery side of this.\n\n(Sources: [https://www.tobaccoinaustralia.org.au/chapter-5-uptake/5-7-the-home-environment](https://www.tobaccoinaustralia.org.au/chapter-5-uptake/5-7-the-home-environment) , [https://www.nationalhealthexecutive.com/articles/children-more-likely-to-smoke-if-their-parents-are-smokers#:\\~:text=Research%20into%20smoking%20influences%20on,if%20their%20main%20caregiver%20smokes.](https://www.nationalhealthexecutive.com/articles/children-more-likely-to-smoke-if-their-parents-are-smokers#:~:text=Research%20into%20smoking%20influences%20on,if%20their%20main%20caregiver%20smokes.)) )\n\nWanting to play a game to help you maintain your happiness? That's not going to increase your risks of cancer in both yourself and those around you, whilst consuming 1/3 of your pay check. 100% NTA. Could nicotine replacement therapy be an option?

This would at least help to stop the financial hemorrhaging...", "NTA, she is an addict. I don\u2019t think being upset with her is going to help. She needs resources and maybe medication.", "This is really bad \u2026 I\u2019d bring it up with her family and friends because she is not listening to you \nTo put smoking before your children and partner is extremely selfish and neglectful\u2026 she definitely has a addictive nature if she did stop smoking she would just get a new addiction\u2026 is there anywhere you can go to get free therapy for her ?? So NTA !!!", "I also agree about vaping. A good selling point is that it can be done inside. Elf bars are the most popular disposable kind.", "ESH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMake a new agreement: She needs to cover half of the rent, and half of other costs. THe rest is hers to decide.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd if you can not reach a compromise there - she needs to work more or spend less - end the relationship.", "NTA. But I might not be the most objective person. Hubby and I just got into an argument about this the other night. I had another pair of shoes delivered to the house, this has made 5 pairs I bought this year including the pair I bought for him. He complained how we aren\u2019t saving money. I told him that each pair cost less than a carton of his cigarettes.", "NTA - Time to file for divorce, take the kids and get out of this house.", "Im trying to move from 2 pack a day to vape may i dm you?", "Absolutely. in addition, she seems to be choosing the habit over the family. Another reason to seek help.", "Totally agree and I think it's worth bearing in mind that at 2.5 packs a day not only is that a huge amount of money upfront but you're looking at an individual who will more likely as not find themselves less able to work in future and facing expensive health costs - even in country's with afforable/free at the point of care healthcare, long term care for disability tends to cost money. \n\nA recent family reunion, where multiple members of the family hit 70 during the pandemic, really drove home to me the devastating impact of smoking, even on the ones who quit years ago. We've got a partner with congestive heart failure who couldn't come, another relative with  COPD/emphysema, several cancers the probability of which were raised by smoking, and you could see the difference in ageing and health between those who smoked (even if they'd quit) and those who never smoked. It was really quite stark and I don't think any of them were ever on a two pack a day habit. \n\nIt may sound cold, but I think it's reasonable to at least question tying yourself to an individual who is sabotaging a secure future in this way.", ">Maybe challenge her to a single pack a week for starters.\n\nI agree with you that this needs to get under control, but you're talking about going from 50 cigarettes a day to 3 cigarettes a day.  She probably won't be able to do that.", "This comment needs to be higher. OP, is it time to consider ending the relationship again? Are there welfare supports available for single parents where you live? It may be easier to live as a single dad than with a woman who isn't being realistic about your finances.", ">I'd give her a portion of the bills, she has to be responsible for paying and I mean put it on her name. \n\nHow does that work? Where I live, you can't unilaterally opt out of being responsible for bills that you're responsible for. You're either contractually (rent, credit cards, etc) or statutorily (utilities, tax, etc) on the hook for them.", "Yeah no worries", "You can't opt out but you can change the name of the person responsible for them like me and my OH split our bills so all the water bills, tax and car are in my name so if I default it's.me.they go to. And he has gas, electric, tax etc which have him as the account holder so they'd be contacting him for default payments.", "That's my point though, you surely can't change the name of the person responsible. You can try to change the point of contact, but ultimately the creditor will go after any and all people associated with the debt."]}
