It's an accident and Andy should have apologized for it since she's the responsible adult when it comes to her baby. That she didn't is a problem. At the same time wearing something like that around a baby is somewhat asking for the baby to pull at it, so it sounds to me like Kayla also screwed up with her choice of earrings (probably didn't even cross her mind, which is quite understandable at her age). Furthermore I doubt the baby had enough strength to cause that damage with a pull, it's more likely Kayla moved her head back at the same time, likely making her to blame for more of the damage than the baby. And honestly the adults should have noticed this issue with her earrings and had her change to safer earrings since there's a baby (since I'm assuming it wasn't a stud), so I have to say that all the adults involved, you included, share some responsibility for what happened. Trying to shove all the blame on Andy and none on Kayla and the rest of you thus doesn't feel entirely correct.\n\nWe also both know that a 19 year old with a baby isn't going to have the money for something like this. So it's no wonder that your sister called you a bitch for even suggesting such a thing, who wouldn't respond like that? \n\nAlso note that most small claim courts don't allow pain and suffering to be added, even trying it in this case makes you husband come off as an asshole in this post. The entire post honestly makes me feel like everybody needs to take a step back and cool their heads before doing anything else.", "YTA - Um... no.\n\nSee, the issue becomes intent. A child that small has no concept and very little control of function. Had there been a temper tantrum and the grab/pull was intentional and meant to harm (even at that age) I would say the blame leans towards Andy for not controlling her child.\n\nBut at 15 months, a happy smiley baby still has exceptionally little hand-eye coordination and even wanting to 'touch' could turn to accidental damage (which it did).\n\ninfo: Who was watching the baby? Was the teenager aware the child was nearby? Was she holding/playing with her? Did she take any precautions to make sure the child could not reach her earrings? (*No, I am NOT pushing blame.* I ask because most of us know to keep dangly and shiny things away from cats and babies because they will see it as a lure and go for it lol).\n\nIf she didn't know to move, I would say it's no one's fault as it was purely accidental - Family was watching the baby, baby didn't know any better, teen didn't know to move so baby couldn't snag an earring. The only intentional AH seems to be the person trying to act like this was a purposeful act and the teen was a total victim. Unless she was asleep and the baby wandered in on her own with no one watching her, and attacked the earring, there are a whole lot of steps between that could have ensured this had not happened.", "NTA\n\nIt was obviously an accident, and you can't hold a 13 month old responsible for breaking things: they don't understand the concept.\n\nThat said, as a parent, you are responsible for the things your child breaks.

Now it was clearly an accident, but as established in PRETTY MUCH EVERY OTHER SIMILAR POST where property is ACCIDENTALLY destroyed, you are not an AH for looking for compensation of some kind. Given the situation you could give Andy a break. Especially if there were contributing factors like big, grabbable hoops or earrings or such. But reddit would vote this, on any normal day, NTA for asking for some compensation from the parent of the child that did the damage. And RL I have seen relationships wrecked over less.", "NTA-  of course she has to pay, it\u2019s her child.  Honestly if she was apologetic and offered to pay some amount like $500, or to pay off $2000 over the next two years, I would say that\u2019s acceptable. But if you\u2019re going to not apologize, block me, and say I shouldn\u2019t expect a dime, well now you owe me $5k.  I went to the best plastic surgeon in the state willing to play ball and I saved all my receipts from gas money, hotels, the procedure, etc. \n\nI would even negotiate with the surgeon that I would pay a little extra for the ear surgery if he does a couple minor mole removals or laser treatments. But the bill will just say I had one procedure done (Because they\u2019re just charging the maximum for the surgery instead of giving me whatever \u201cdiscount\u201d and instead the other things are given \u201cfree\u201d and therefore not billed). Then I\u2019m taking this niece to court and waxing her for the max.", "Ultimate US shit. Here you wouldn\u2019t have to pay for surgery, so no need to sue family to pay for it.

You are responsible for your crotch monster for 18 years, anything they do is your fault if you are the parent. What 15 month old does something like that anyway, don't let it near pets that's for sure. Honestly the insurance company are little goblins too, \"elective surgery\", you have a chunk of your head dangling and bleeding off the side of your face and tell some how elective that is to fix. Andy doesn't get to save up and move out, she has a completely new set of responsibilities she has to deal with now for about two decades and she better start acting like it.", "Does your niece have the money to pay?  I doubt a 19 year old has $2000 laying around. \n\nSo good luck getting anything other than an apology. \n\nAlso, don\u2019t wear earrings like that around a baby", "YTA. Maybe you could get the baby\u2019s future earnings garnished.", "NTA, but you need to talk to insurance and get that cosmetic issue reversed.", "YTA /kinda E S H.\n\nBabies grab things. When I was about your daughter's age, my aunt had a baby and he would constantly pull hair, necklaces, etc. Even at 13 I knew not to wear loose things around small children (not that this is your daughter's fault.) I've also had to go to plastic surgeons over earring issues at that age; it sucks but it's truly not the end of the world.\n\nThis was an accident. Shit happens. Sure, Andy should've shown more concern (which is why everyone kind of sucks here), but demanding a 19-year-old with a 15-month-old baby pay for the medical treatment is crazy. I can't imagine ever doing something like that to my family or friends, heck even a stranger, over an accident like this.", "YTA. Mom should have warned daughter about what jewelry can & can't be worn around babies.", "I mean logically speaking; if a child were to take a glass plate at a store and throw it and break it the parent would be responsible to pay for that. If a teenager does something stupid and breaks a neighbors window - that is on the parents (of course circumstances depending perhaps the teenager can get a job or work off the broken window) but the point is - when you have kids you, as a parent or guardian, are responsible for them and the things they break, damage, or injure. Now that said - you\u2019re thinking of suing a single(?) mother who is living with her mother trying to make ends meet and save up for a place of her own. You said she has saving but it would be a real jerk move to take her savings when you can afford to pay for the surgery yourself. Now, her attitude is disgusting. I can see why your husband is so mad at her for not even caring about your daughter. \n\nPersonally, I\u2019d just pay for the surgery myself and completely cut them out of your life. Stop seeing them. Stop giving them any aid if you do. Stop going to holidays with them. They obviously don\u2019t care about your daughter or you **at all**. If you want to sue them you can, but I don\u2019t know I if you\u2019d get the money anytime soon, if ever, and it will destroy your relationship with them (which, in my opinion, is over anyway).

NTA", "Well bad news is if you take her to court you'll be rejected in your family over a few grand. You'll be that person. No one will trust you and they will see it as how you actively ruined someone's early adulthood. Sister and Niece will tell the rest of the family how you were to cheap to pay for it and then forced them with threats of legal action. It makes sense that they wouldn't reach out and check up on either of you.You basically made a threat to them do X or Y will happen. At that point I imagine your sister and niece are protecting themselves and furious at you. Also kids are not even responsible for breaking stuff in stores anymore. I can't imagine this going overly well in court either. Even if it does you effectively have ruined someone else's life for years. Saving money is hard when you are a single parent. So you effectively have ruined your Nieces early adulthood for several more years. No one will ever take kindly to that fact. You'll end up isolated from your own family. People around you who know about this might kinda phase out as well. If you can do that to family how about a non blood friend? \n\nAlso NTA. I can already see whats gonna happen, but I do think you are justified in asking for reimbursement. I do think you should of asked afterwards tho.", "YTA\n\nNo way a 15 month old ripped out an earring causing that much damage on their own without the help of additional force from the 13 year old. \n\nSo either make the 13 year old pay for half since the 15 month old is not capable of being 100% at fault for the injury, or eat the costs and stop being ridiculous.", "YTA. Legally, sure, you'd probably win the case. The parent is responsible for damages inflicted upon others by their children.\n\nThat does not mean you're not AH, though. You pretty much are. There's no 'kid badly behaved' when you're talking about a literal toddler. Btw, how did the baby even reach the ears?\n\nYou SHOULD be going after your insurance, for insisting that is a cosmetic procedure, not a covered one.

You're willing to implode your relationship with your niece, your sister, and your niece's daughter (and possibly other family members as well) over a surgery that's not even scheduled yet. It sounds like a genuine accident and not some act of malice or neglect.\n \nThe reasonable thing to do would have been to ask her to cover your ER bill after insurance and just accept that shitty accidents happen sometimes and if you choose to do a cosmetic procedure (which does sound reasonable in this situation), pay for it yourself, or have her sign a contract to pay a portion back when she files taxes next year.

Maybe Andy's behavior is bad here also, I dunno, but you didn't include those facts so I'm not including it in my judgment.\n\nThis is an unfortunate accident, and it is probably payable by insurance. I know that insurance turned you down initially, because that is what they do, but polite persistence may pay off here. Or maybe not, but your odds of getting money from the insurance company are much higher than getting money from your 19-year-old niece. \n\nSome folks here seem to think that Andy has to pay for damages caused by her baby. I don't think that is true in most of the US; the law recognizes that small children are not really controllable. What do you think Andy should have done differently? Never put the baby down, even around family? Tell everyone that babies grab things? Hover over the baby for every minute? The law doesn't require that, and, for similar reasons, morality and civility don't either. So even if you sue, I doubt you win; you'd have to prove your niece was 'negligent,' i.e., careless, and, from the facts you give, your daughter more likely bears the blame than your grandniece. I got my ear pierced when my brother was a baby and had a baby's tendency to grab, but I was able to defend myself. You will definitely not get pain and suffering in small claims, and probably not anywhere else, but if you want to blow up this relationship forever you could go ask a lawyer and (I suspect) hear exactly what I am telling you.\n\nI agree that your niece should have shown sympathy for your daughter, but you come across as so combative and unreasonable here that all communications are likely to have dried up.", "YTA Your sister is correct.

Andy should have been more apologetic and sympathetic, but if you all were immediately jumping down his throat, I can see why he took a defensive position.  \n\n\nIf you sue your teenage nibling for the actions of a baby, and try to add \"pain and suffering\" on top of it, you will be an enormous asshole.", "ESH.\n\nYour niece sucks for not being more empathetic to the situation and not checking in.\n\nThe 15 month old is a 15 month old.  9/10 kids that age don't know any better.  \n\nYou suck for being so awful to your sister and your niece about this.  I get your daughter was in pain and plastic surgery is necessary to fix it, but I can tell that you weren't very kind with your reaction to this.  \n\nIt looks like you are coming in as an angry mom (albeit, rightfully so) as if it was some stranger who did this maliciously.  It was a 15 month old who accidentally did it.  Should her mom be responsible?  Yes.  But when it's a 19 year old mom (barely an adult herself) there was likely a different way you could have gone about it.  Instead of demanding the money, sit and talk with her and your sister and work on some sort of arraingement.  \n\nAlso, fight with the insurance, and have your doctor fight for you too.  Doctors are willing to fight for their patients to get insurance to cover things.  I'm 38 and I have gotten shingles multiple times.
