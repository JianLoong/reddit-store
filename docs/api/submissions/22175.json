It can ruin your entire experience and at 5k, not worth it.", "Honestly I'm more just floored at how low this price is ! 5k for up to 10 people ?!? Skipping all the lines and front row seats ?? How ?? Just a normal day at the park with that many people and whatever that new genie thing is that replaced fast passes and a meal and snacks for some probably costs that much alone. Where did you find this amazing deal ?!!? My twin and I need to make this a combined bday gift for our Disney obsessed nibling !!!", "Unless the rules have changed you can absolutely swap people for other people at random times during the day as long as the guide in never responsible for more than 10 people at at time (source was a vip hostess for almost a decade)", "I say YTA for trying to dictate how your bil enjoys his trip. You say you want to ride the rides with him but he obviously doesn\u2019t care about having that experience with you guys. He would rather spend this trip with his girlfriend and he would rather her son get that experience since 1) the kids a kid and would get more out of it and 2) it would probably endear him and the rest of his family (supposedly) to his girlfriend and her family. \n\nI mean what if he just says eff it and all three of them decide to go on their own without you all. Sounds like if you back him into a corner this is probably what he would choose. Like it or not he\u2019s committed to his relationship. He probably wants to get alone time with her which he might not get often because her son is around. Also, what kind of jerk would he look like to his gf and her son leaving them alone in a park to spend time with you guys when they were invited on the trip too? \n\nPlanning a Disney trip is hard enough. Stop being so controlling and you\u2019ll find that everyone will have a better time. The VIP tour is a flat rate for up to 10 so it\u2019s not even like you\u2019re spending extra money for the kid. But if he you don\u2019t let the kid go guarantee you\u2019ll have 9 on the tour instead of ten.", "NAH. You have the right to decide who's in your group. It's also reasonable for an adult to not care about going to Disneyland and to want to give the tickets to a kid who would.", "Whoop! There it is.", "Yep. You don't know this kid   he could be amazing or a brat. Plus what mother fobs her kid off on people she barely knows  that's an alarm right there", "And free babysitting from the people who paid for the trip.", "Thanks for responding, I agree, we've only met his girlfriends son twice and he is 7, so not the easiest age.", "Technically not his family till he puts a ring on it.", "Oh no, sorry it's not including tickets or food, so you buy the tickets and then it's $700 an hour for minimum of 7 hours and then plus tip and all the food costs", "Also you\u2019re absolutely not the AH and I misread that it was the gf son I thought it was your nephews gf but taking on an extra minor so their parents can have a Disney day F that!", "They will be stuck with taking care of the child of someone they don't know. \\\\\n\nNTA.", "But BIL doesn\u2019t need taking care of. If the gf\u2019s son goes instead, who is gonna take care of him?", "You are welcome\u2026 yeah 7 is definitely not the easiest age specially if you going to Disney and kids will want to run or try everywhere.\n\nIt would be unfair to have you basically babysit someone kids that you barely know. \n\nWould say to ask him again about it else, just say it\u2019s fine you would find someone else to take his place.", "Honestly that is still quite reasonable for all you are getting and especially if we can get a bunch of family on board. All of us cousins will have just as much fun as our nibling. With at least 7 of chipping in, spending 1400-1500 per person to celebrate this kiddo and give him a dream day is super doable - he's officially in remission and his immune system has improved enough that he's cleared to be a normal kid and experience being around lots of people for the first time in so many years (without having to wear tons of protective gear ! Front row to the shows AND line skipping ?!? Like I cannot comprehend how much my little bud would love and go crazy for this !\n\nWould it be alright for me to dm you to ask for some of the details on how I could go about purchasing a similar experience?", "Exactly what I was thinking.

Dm me and I'll send you the link!", "And that does sound absolutely amazing and totally worth it \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "NTA , if he\u2019s going to do that tell him that you\u2019ll find the substitute", "NTA", "BIL can refuse the ticket if he wants, but he can't tell you who to give it to.

Just because you purchased a package for ten people doesn't suddenly mean his spot has zero financial value. He's asking you to babysit a kid who doesn't really know you on top of paying for the trip and any incidentals.\n\nIf he doesn't want to come, you can invite someone else or go without him. If you decide to babysit the child so he can have a weekend free with his girlfriend, ask him to pay for the portion of expenses that would cover the spot used by this random child, plus a babysitting fee for the inconvenience. Just because you were willing to cover him for a free trip does not mean you must be willing to cover just anyone for the trip.\n\nNTA\n\nEta: It's interesting that he thinks a 7 year old child who has met you twice is going to feel ok being thrown into your care with a bunch of other people they don't know for however long. That by itself can be very scary for a kid let alone being surrounded by strangers in a loud chaotic strange place. Clearly it's more about getting rid of the kid than who will enjoy the trip more.", "NTA. They can pay a babysitter and go on a date night that way and NOT use your Disneyland trip for that.", "NAH\n\nYou can decline to change the guest list. \nYour bil can decline your invite. \n\nYou just have to accept that your bil won't join and not starting drama over it. He doesn't have to join only bc you invite him and you want to have him there.", "NTA but do you understand that you will need to fill the spot if you do not let the child attend?\n\nIf BIL is willing to pay for two tickets for BIL and the girlfriend, BIL will either pay for the son as well or not go at all and find something fun for the lad that they can afford. You don't know the girlfriend or her son, but BIL does and obviously cares about them both just from your description.", "NTA. If he is refusin to go, good, its his choice.\nYou dont have to stik with someone you dont know ir her child.\nThis is a family trip and his girlfriend or her kid are not family.", "NAH\n\nI don't think anyone is an AH in this situation. Your BIL wasn't interested in this VIP tour with his mom. He'd rather spend the day with his girlfriend, and his girlfriend's son get the VIP treatment. You aren't OK with the girlfriend's son, who you don't know well, to have that experience. That's OK. But it doesn't sound like anyone is throwing a fit or anything. \n\nJust invite someone else instead, since BIL isn't interested.", "OP said in a comment that the child is 7 and they have only met him twice. They're effective strangers. \n\nSounds like a very stressful day for everyone involved except for BIL and his gf.", "Since bil mom also got a spot i think its not unlikely that the plan was mom watching the additional grandkid, though op doesn't mention anything. I'm pretty sure bil wouldn't have suggested this when not at least one adult his stepson is familiar with is there - and since op doesn't know them and mom seems to live near bil, this adult would be grandma.", "Yah, I don't think it's fair for everyone to be calling this guy an asshole for not wanting to go on a VIP Disney tour with just his \"real\" family when he has a step-kid who would probably die for an experience like that. Hell, I'd feel weird going to Disney without my little sister, and she's 17. A little kid doesn't really understand the context of an invite like this, he'd just feel sad and left out.\n\n But the people who paid for a VIP tour also aren't assholes for wanting to spend it with their invited adult guests rather than babysitting a kid they barely know. It's just an awkward situation all around, NAH", "Does your BIL like going on rides? Maybe he gets motion sick as an adult? Maybe he just wants this experience to go to someone who would really enjoy it.", "No one gives a shit", "I also volunteer to help with trip planning! I don't work for Disney but love helping people plan special days :)", "You would be better served by getting a DAS pass (free) if the repercussions of his treatment would make it difficult for him to stand and wait in lines. Please investigate this first, there is a great chance that it would apply to his situation.", "You don\u2019t skip lines per se, you get into the LL. If that wait is 20 min, you wait.", "NTA at all, if you\u2019re paying it\u2019s your choice. I do kinda understand his intentions though. He\u2019s a grown man and probably not that interested in Disney Land but he can see that his partners son would absolutely LOVE it. I can imagine him thinking a swap isn\u2019t a big deal. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s an AH either.", "The whole time I was like weh now you have to babysit the kid while their parents are having their date. Idiiih", "NTA even if you were familiar with this kid, you'd be liable for anything that happens to this kid and have to babysit them during your vacation.\n\nwhy would this mother want to go to disneyland, without their child..", "NTA in a million years! You're forking out 5k not him. I think your BIL is looking at it as free childcare and time away from the kid for the day so him and GF can go around the place childfree. There's a slim chance he genuinely wants the kid to experience something like this as not everyone will ever have the chance to, but with him now refusing to go? Nah you're \ud83d\udcaf in the right here", "Why should you be responsible for a stranger's 7yo you've only met twice? \n\nYou're not his gf's babysitter. This child is not friends with your children. He's a stranger. And you're not obliged to give him the VIP Disney Tour. \n\nNTA", "NTA", "Or maybe BIL just thought the 7 year old child would enjoy the experience more. Not everyone is out there to just use other people, perhaps BIL actually had good intentions.", "Also when I was 7 I would\u2019ve been really uncomfortable if my mom left me with people I barely knew. Wtf?", "My guess is that BIL is pressured into it and GF won't let him go by himself.\n\nNothing wrong with asking, but saying he won't go at all after the no seems weird to me.", "You can't do the same stuff at somewhere like Disney land with a 7 year old, too much is age/height restrictive. You cop this if it's your kid, but no way should you be obligated to do it for someone else's kid, let alone one you've met twice. You're there to have a good time not babysit. Definitely NTA.", "Yeah but common sense lah. 7 year-old is usually a handful (I would know I'm a teacher) Plus they don't even know this kid. Not very bright the brother", "This is not BIL's step kid. It is his girlfriends 7 year old son. OP has only met him two times. \n\nAs a mother, I would NOT be comfortable with my child spending a day with a group of people they do not know. If the BIL was planning to be there, with my child, that would be an entirely different situation. However, BIL is just dropping the kid with his family and leaving. This is NOT okay. My 7 year old would be nervous and scared. They would not want to go. They would be with 9 strangers. Also OP would be responsible for a child they barely know. I would not want that responsibility. Pretty sure OP does not want it either.\n\nI do not see everyone calling BIL an asshole for not wanting to go with his \"real family\". People are upset with BIL for wanting to leave his girlfriends child with people the child barely knows.", "It's not a step-kid since he isn't married. Granted, we don't know how long he's been with his girlfriend, but it seems like not too long since the rest of the family barely knows her and her son.\n\nPlus, amazing experience or not, it's pretty weird for a kid to go with a bunch of adults who are virtually strangers.", "A 7 year old can't go on any of the good rides anyway, meaning OP can't when babysitting", "Oh yeah, OP doesn't know the 7 year old well at all, so it would be weird for everyone. But most likely the BIL just didn't think it through, but it doesn't mean he was thinking anything but the kid would enjoy the VIP experience more.", "NTA.  You made a generous offer to your BIL.  He doesn't want it, he wants you to take responsibility of his GF's son, a 7 year old, that you have met twice.  That's a big no, you don't really know this kid or even your BIL's GF, they just want someone else to look after her kid while they get free babysitting.  You are paying 5K for this tour and want to enjoy it without having to worry about the possibility of someone's kid you don't know throwing a tantrum and ruining it for everyone, invite someone else if BIL doesn't want to go.  I'm sure you have other family members who will appreciate it, or your MIL may have a suggestion of who you could invite.", "Yta. So you honestly think that he's going to just go to all of the events and the parade with you and your husband and ignore his girlfriend and future stepchild at Disney? I would definitely give up my spot for a child because they would enjoy it more and Disney is for kids. You do technically get to decide but if you denied the spot to the kid then I would also refuse the spot so I could spend it with my family. I get that you can only choose ten people but you do realize that you're excluding his family and no good parent would go off on a vacation and ditch their gf and kid?", "nta", "NTA.

You invited him. Not \"fill the spot.\"\n\nYou don't know the child.\n\nWho is supervising the child ? Oh yes. That would be you.", "NTA he wants to tour Disney with the girlfriend while you babysit. Find someone else to go with you.", "Absolutely not the AH.", "NTA\nIt\u2019s really rude to tell someone that paid for you to go, that you are giving your ticket to someone else. Don\u2019t ever invite him anywhere again.", "NTA\n\nKid is going to be upset and possibly ill-behaved without either of his parents with him. Yes, even if it is a VIP Disney pass. Also, babysitting a stranger's kid when you are meant to be enjoying your VIP pass is no fun.\n\nIf one of the invited guests wants to give up a spot, then BiL could babysit the kid as a guest, and the boy could go instead of that other guest. But I can't see anyone willing to give up their spot, and I can't see any good ways of raising the subject.", "NAH. You offered a spot and he declined. No one is in the wrong.", "NTA. You get to decide what to do with your tickets. Just invite someone else", "NTA\n\nEach and every single one of those 10 tickets that you're purchasing are your tickets.\n\nYour BIL was invited, he doesn't accept the invitation to be a guest on your ticket if he doesn't want to join you. However, the fact that he was offered an invitation doesn't mean it's now his ticket to give away as he pleases. It's not his ticket, it's still your ticket. You can invite someone else with it if he declines his invitation.\n\nI would now retract his invitation full stop. I can imaging him changing his mind to go with you then claiming an emergency 12 minutes before you have to leave, but don't worry, gf's son is right here available to go.", "So he wants you all to pay for and watch his girlfriend's son the entire trip so they can go on dates. I'd uninvite him from the entire trip and see if someone else was available. That's top shelf audacity. NTA. A seven year old you barely know! It's $500 for a stranger!", "NTA", "NAH. He can ask and you can say no. I imagine he thought a kid would have more fun on the tour than he would.", "NTA - you invited him and he didn't want to go.  Offer it to somebody else in the family.  I'll go !!!\n\nIts a pricey thing - you should maximize its use.\n\nI'm guessing GF made an issue of it, saying that he was less entitled to go than her son so he wouldn't be able to enjoy it because she will make a thing of it.", "NTA", "[removed]", "NTA - this isn\u2019t about giving the gfs son a special treat.", "I agree with this. I think they definitely want a \u201cbabysitter\u201d for the gf\u2019s child.", "I didn\u2019t know to tag along without at least one guardian who knows them", "AND pay for the privilege on top.", "He didn't really ask for a swap though. A swap would be one adult for another adult. He asked to give the spot to his girlfriend's 7 year old kid. So what he's really asking is for OP to babysit a kid they don't know all day at Disney while he & his girlfriend go around by themselves.", "OMG yes, NAH. I don't understand all these comments calling BIL the A H for making a suggestion.", "He is only 7? Dude, they're trying to pawn him off to you for babysitting.  The BIL can choose to forfeit his place, but can't ask you to pick someone else who is a stranger to you to go with you.\n\nThat being said, can I come tho? I'm a 29yo kid, so I won't cause that much trouble. And I promise to not make unreasonable demands of you. Lol.\n\nNTA.", "That makes it even worse. For some reason, I was picturing a young adult son, or at least, an old enough teenager that could reasonably look after themselves. The fact that it's a 7 year old child, tells me that this is more about your BIL & his gf trying to dump her kid on someone else, so that they can get a kid-free couples holiday, whilst the rest of you will basically have your VIP trip ruined, because you have to babysit this child that you barely even know.\n\nNTA. Stick to your guns. If your BIL insists, either find some other family member to join, or see if you can get some kind of refund or discount for the last remaining unused spot.", "NTA, but I think you might want to read that last sentence again.", "She did, the kid is 7", "I'm sure you have other family members who will appreciate it, or your MIL may have a suggestion of who you could invite.", "Yes, I\u2019d have cried. Many small children would if left with strangers. As if the op wants to spend \u00a35000 to babysit a child she doesn\u2019t know who might end up tearful at being away from his mother.", "You say this but she hasn\u2019t said how old her kids are", "Or he could have done it off his own back to look good to his girlfriend for getting her son this opportunity.", "Why assume he\u2019s pressured? I feel like I\u2019d give up my spot for a kid at Disney without any pressure, so that really might not be it frankly. I also feel like I\u2019d want to be with my partner (granted I\u2019m married but I felt that way long before being officially married).\n\nI get why OP feels as they do, but I also get good instinct to a) think the kid would get more out of that and b) want to be with his GF and let the kid go with them.

It\u2019s not a shock to me that the BIL might genuinely just *want* him to have that experience. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily him trying to pawn off junior and getting free babysitting as much as it is him wanting to include the people he loves in a family outing \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nI\u2019m looking at this the  way I would maybe try to approach it, and this would kind of be a compromise that I would offer. \u201cIt\u2019s not my thing, but GFs kid would really love to do this and if he takes my spot that\u2019s still a reasonable 3 kids to 7 adults.

It's honestly making me cry a bit - he had wanted a Disney trip for his make a wish but got too sick to go and most of the last few years it just hasn't been safe with his compromised immune system even if he had felt ok enough. But getting to take him as a whole family when he's healthy feels awesome. The other option we had was doing Greece since my twin sister, him, and I had the best time breaking out her classics degree and me reading myths very animatedly - so we'll just take him and our cousin sister (his mom) and her partner on  a separate vacation another year :)", "Totally a skip in my mind!

Our family's full of doctors and cancer survivors as well and his mom is a pediatric oncologist so we're being extremely cognizant of his needs and condition not just in terms of how he's doing medically but also checking in with how his mental health and stress levels are. For him the more he can feel things are celebratory outings he can fully participate in as if he hadn't been sick, the happier he is. \n\nI and our family have had really positive experiences with Disney and accommodating for medical and disability needs in the past so we will definitely keep the option open !

Your trip sounds wonderful. If it were my son, and I could give him that opportunity by giving up my spot, it would mean the world to me to be able to do so.

I think it's ok that your brother doesn't want to go, and it's ok you aren't interested in bringing his girlfriend's kid in his place. I don't see why people think brother is TA.

He may not be thinking about how that affects the rest of the group (which I don\u2019t think makes him an AH, just not thinking about all the details) and that also makes you N T A. You\u2019re right to not want a child you don\u2019t know to join the group. From what I understand of these tours you\u2019re all together the whole time, moving very fast, and with little breaks to get from ride to ride. For a kid who, at that age, probably needs a lot of breaks that could be too much. You\u2019re also just fully allowed to not want to bring a child if you didn\u2019t invite them in the first place. They can be difficult (especially if you don\u2019t know them) and not wanting them there because that wasn\u2019t yours plan is reason enough.

You're paying for it, you get to pick.\n\nHe wants to give the experience to the child for whom it would be more magical than him.\n\nHe's fine to be upset that you're being that rigid and choose not to go.\n\nYou're fine to be upset that he's prioritizing his partner and her son over you.", "NTA forget your \u201cwanting to be around family\u201d reason and think of safety you don\u2019t know the girlfriend you don\u2019t know the son but they basically expect you to babysit while they go off on their own", "You didn't offer him a free ticket.  You offered to take him to the park.  Its your vacation that you invited him to participate in.  Quite frankly its pretty rude he attempted the switch.  NTA", "NTA\n\nthey want to dump the kid on you for free babysitting. That\u2019s what this boils down to.", "NTA Does mom or your husband have a friend they could invite to fill BIL's spot?", "NTA.  It is not reasonable to expect you to babysit a stranger.  You know nothing about this kid or the mom.  While it would be a nice gesture to let him come, it's not necessary, & may be a burden.  Also, this kid doesn't know any of you, so maybe he would be uncomfortable too.  Anyway, this is your day that you spent a lot of money for to spend with your family, not to babysit someone elses kid.", "NTA. They want a baby sitter.", "NTA invite someone else that is appreciative of your generosity!", "EFF NO is a complete sentence.", "NAH. He doesn\u2019t want to do it, you can\u2019t make him. You don\u2019t want the kid, he can\u2019t make you. Plans just don\u2019t work. Oh well.", "NTA. He wants a free day away from the kid and is making it seem like he wants to hook up the kid.", "He's more than welcome to decline your invite, but then it's up to you to determine whom gets it instead.\n\nNTA", "NTA and to me it sounds like the girlfriend and her kid are pressuring him", "NTA you are paying and get to say who is invited. Additionally, letting the girlfriend\u2019s son take his place would make you responsible for him? How old is he?", "Nta. I wouldn\u2019t want to be in charge of a kid I don\u2019t know all day.", "NTA - You paid for it, you can invite anyone you want. But why would you invite the BIL and his girlfriend but not her son. Obviously that would not work out. You should have picked two others.", "NTA, for one, if 'meeting up' is an option, why can't BIL arrange to do that with his gf and kid separately? Now for two, it's YOUR trip and YOUR money. If they want a say in who goes on the trip, they can shell out for their own Disneyland Tour, otherwise they can adult up and accept your kind invitation and if not, you can invite someone who will actually be grateful to go.", "NTA you dont know this kid", "NTA and you will be stuck babysitting a kid you don't know, while your BIL and his girlfriend have a lovely date day.", "NTA sounds like brother in law wants a free day at Disney with his girlfriend and you are the babysitter.", "Your money your invitation. This was meant to be family time and not a free vacation for someone who will spend the day elsewhere.\n\nIf your brother doesn\u2019t wish to come that\u2019s fine. You can invite someone else who will appreciate your company.\n\nNTA", "NAH\n\nHe doesn't have to accept your ticket, you don't have to accept the kid in his place. \n\nI think its a little silly to expect him to want to spend the whole day with you guys and not with his girlfriend/her kid.", "NTA!! 1) Yes you are the one paying so yes you decide who gets the invite. 2) Brother and GF are looking for a free babysitter.", "Oh, so you get to be the sitter for a child you don\u2019t know?  NTA.  Perhaps they could spend the day with her son, and you just forgo the other spot?", "INFO: How long has he been with his girlfriend? Are they serious? \n\nNAH - if they've been together a while with no end in sight (especially if they live together) you gotta see how he'd feel bad taking off to Disney for the day and leaving girlfriend/son behind. He probably feels like it'd be more special for the son to have the VIP experience and is sacrificing it to give the kid an amazing time while he still has a nice time. \n\nYou're NTA but it's just a tricky spot, he offered an alternative and you're not okay with it - totally okay but you do have to be okay with him turning it down instead of leaving behind the girlfriend/son.", "NTA.  This is extremely simple.  You invited your brother-in-law specifically.  That's a yes/no question for him to answer.  Does he want to come with you?  Yes or no.  An invite doesn't give the person that is being invited the right to substitute somebody else in their place.  That's not how it works. So, if he doesn't want to go with you guys, the answer is simply no, he's not interested.  He doesn't get to tell you who to take in his place, that's presumptuous and really nervy on his part.  If he's going to complain about the situation, point out that this wouldn't be any different than if he decided to host a family dinner at his home and you suddenly sent random people in your place.", "NTA not only would you not get to spend time with your brother you would be completely saddled with an extra kid that you don\u2019t know, with no help from his mom or your brother. Sounds like your brother gets to spend the whole time child free with his gf while he looks like a hero to his gf\u2019s son. No, you\u2019re paying. You get to decide. Also, him saying he won\u2019t go then? Is he threatening you with a good time, or what? Is there someone else who could go instead?", "NTA. You are paying a lot of money for these tickets, and you have a right to invite who you want to invite. You have no obligation to take someone that you didn't invite.", "NTA.  He's setting you up as a babysitter.  An babysitter who paid $5K for the privilege of doing so.", "NAH. Hear me out, OP. \n\nI think it\u2019s pretty rude to insinuate he should be excited and willing to spend the day with his \u201creal\u201d family - which is the message you\u2019re inadvertently sending - knowing his stepson that he\u2019s actively parenting is going to miss out. \n\nHe\u2019s right to decline the invitation based on that. I can\u2019t think of any parent who would want to attend an event their child isn\u2019t welcome to. Any 7 year old will be hurt over this. \n\nBut also, you\u2019re paying for the event; you decide the guest list. And you\u2019ve decided. He is now bowing out, as is his right. He is choosing to be a good parent, and you can\u2019t hold that against him.", "At first I was going to say you're TA, but after reading more, I'd have to say NTA. Who 'abandons' their 7 yr old son on a trip at Disneyland? That's something you want to enjoy as a FAMILY. I'm guessing he wants to spend quality time as a couple together and doesn't want her son interrupting them so he's pawning him off to you guys.", "I would say NAH as long as BIL isn't being pushy about including his girlfriend's son.\n\nI completely get how your BIL would feel weird taking a VIP Disneyland spot when a 7 y/o kid in his life, who he knows would love it way more than him, doesn't get to go. But of course you have 0 responsibility to provide free child care for a kid you barely know.", "YTA. \n\nMost of these comments assume your brother is dumping this kid on you. But maybe he thinks it would be the trip of a lifetime for the gf\u2019s son. I can\u2019t imagine how excited a seven year old would be to go on a Disney VIP tour, but I can imagine going on that tour as an adult and then telling a seven year old about it.", "Regifting is fine. The issue here is that the regifting would cause someone to need to care for a child they don't know. But in general, if someone gives you a gift you aren't into but that you know someone else would absolutely love, it's totally fine to pass it along so that the gift brings joy.", "It kind of is an ah move to try and make someone else watch your girlfriends kid all day, especially when they didn't even pay for the package and OP barely knows the kid.\n\nIt's completely fine for him not to want to go, but it's not okay to try and pawn your girlfriends kid off on someone else that's practically a stranger and at Disney of all places.", "Not their kid, not a kid they know so not their problem", "Only 10 people can go.", "\u201cHe also wants to get alone time with her which he doesn\u2019t get because her son is around\u201d\n\nYeah that\u2019s kind of the deal when you date someone with a child, it comes with the territory and shoykdbt be thrown in others faces just because others chose differently. it doesn\u2019t mean op who\u2019s only met the child twice needs to spend 7+ hours babysitting a kid they barely know at Disney. \n\nBil can pay a babysitter or something if he wants alone time with his girlfriend.", "Whoa - I had assumed the kid was a teenager or something, at least an age where the kid can more or less handle himself.  \n\nAsking someone else to take a 7 year old they don't know for a day is a big ask.\n\nAlthough I can also see why he would feel weird going to a VIP tour that his gf and her son couldn't go on.\n\nSo no one sucks too much I guess.  I can see why he might not want to go at all now as well - there's not much point if he's not actually going to see you guys at all, so why bother going?", "So BIL is looking for a free babysitter so he can enjoy Disney Land instead of you getting to enjoy it.", "7? Absolutely not. It sounds like they not that interested in the tour and it\u2019s using it to get you guys to babysit the 7 year old while he and his GF get to have their own childfree vacation.", "Not really. If I gift my brother a trip to Hawaii to come with us and he regifts it to a friend because said friend loves Hawaii, I'd be pissed. That gift wasn't meant to any random person, I had my brother in mind.", "I agree. It costs him more money to do it this way than to just go by himself. A babysitter costs less than a trip to california at disney. If he just wanted to get some alone time with his girlfriend there would be a lot cheaper ways to do it.", "Pay $5,000 to babysit all day. What a deal!", "Agree! He probably wants the girlfriend's son, as a child, to have the more 'special' amazing experience - not just pawning off the child. Personally, if I was the brother I'd never leave behind a girlfriend/child to go to Disney without them - especially if the relationship is serious. Sincerely NAH here - it's not their fault there's only 1 spot left but you can't blame the guy for not wanting to have the kid not included.", "Right. So what I don\u2019t get is why not invite him,his GF, and stepson over the cousins?", "Agredd. Not just that. But he did not need to tell the kid about it. The adult was invited. That would obviously make the kid jealous. All they had to say is that he had a family thing. Also who would watch the kid no one really knows?", "Why are you upset about this comment?", "Yes, but once they agree to babysit the child, it is too late to back out if his restrictions do no agree with their plans and interests. \n\nAlso, they would be unable to go on a lot of rides because the child was not tall enough or simply not brave enough. The other guests  might all be a lot older. \n\nImagine if the 7 year old were into bumper cars and everyone else wanted to go on the largest, scariest roller coaster.", "but he offered, they said no and he said he wouldn't go. why is he an ah for not wanting to go alone?\ndef a NAH, not a N T A", "Perhaps he's one of the many grown adults who doesn't view a day a at Disney to be a lovely gift. I agree that he shouldn't have tried to pawn off a 7 year old, but he's NTA for choosing not to go at all", "Or, what he's saying is \"Honestly, the tour isn't that appealing,and I'm not going to enjoy being joined at the hip to 10 other people all day\".\n\nOP is complaining that he won't be on the same ride as her, or sit with them at fireworks and parades. But, maybe the whole VIP package has zero appeal.\n\nSure, minding an extra kid is a pain, but - maybe he's thinking the kid might actually enjoy it, as opposed to him.\n\nLike, why would you invite half a couple if they are both going to be at the park?", "And I would have been jazzed about an awesome day with new people at Disney.", "bot", "bot", "bot", "With four kids I thought at least one of OP\u2019s children was close to 7, which means OP couldn\u2019t anyways, but that was definitely an assumption. \n\nSince I got downvoted so hard I guess everyone is pretty certain the BIL just wants free babysitting, so maybe I\u2019m just naive.", "That's not their nephew. Girlfriend's son isn't family, come on.", "Because she gets to enjoy herself at Disney Land while someone babysits her kid for free.", "I suggested that he might not want to spend a day at Disneyland below, and people downvoted me hard. But some people don\u2019t like Disneyland", "Exactly.", "You don't get to volunteer your spot in a VIP tour that someone else is paying for and gifting you for family to spend time together.", "Ok Buddy. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb", "Yes, I agree with that, and basically said as much in my previous comment..", "Minimizing mental stress and fatigue that comes with remission would honestly probably qualify. Maybe worth a check! But VIP is definitely great. It just comes down to line length unfortunately and on a recent trip we waited 20-30 min multiple times. For the $ it should be truly \u201cfront of line\u201d in my opinion. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll have a great trip either way!", "As far as I can tell he didn\u2019t volunteer it without running it past OP first, the answer was just no. \n\nAnd I maintain that not every adult is gonna be interested in a Disney trip, let alone a VIP tour. If I were BIL I\u2019d be frustrated that I wasn\u2019t asked first. There\u2019s an infinite number of enjoyable ways for a family to spend time together without *anyone* dropping five grand on something that some people straight up wouldn\u2019t appreciate or want to do. \n\nAgain, I\u2019m looking it through my lens (which is all anyone can do without BIL coming in and explaining his side) and I can tell you that I would much rather have a kid or interested adult take my place on the expensive once in a life time experience. I also wouldn\u2019t appreciate the exclusion of my partner and her child - OP doesn\u2019t live in the state and can\u2019t speak to how serious that relationship is hue this could be the equivalent of leaving out a wife and child. \n\nAs I said - it\u2019s a NTA ruling but I\u2019m not going to knee jerk and call the BIL an AH either. A Disney trip as an adult who is not interested is a chore, it\u2019s salt in the wound being told your family can\u2019t come.", "You commented about babysitting.  \u201cYa\u2019ll can babysit though\u201d\n\nIt was \u201cyou can share an unforgettable experience with a child though\u201d", "A child they don't know, and did not come all this way to spend time with.", "I don\u2019t know anyone who\u2019s down with spending $500 a head to share a wonderful experience with a child they barely know.  Actually, I don\u2019t know anyone who would expect me to spend that much to give a child I barely know such an experience.  Maybe his motive was to give this kid that experience.  Maybe.  But he\u2019s also thinking he and his girlfriend can also enjoy a child free day at Disney.  Because asking for just this child to go with the group IS asking for them to babysit.\n\nInstead of accepting his brother\u2019s no, that his brother isn\u2019t down with accepting responsibility for a child he barely knows, he\u2019s refusing to go at all.  That\u2019s what muddles the motives.  That\u2019s what makes him seem entitled.  The BIL is not an ass for asking.  He\u2019s an ass for pitching an adult fit when his request was denied."]}
