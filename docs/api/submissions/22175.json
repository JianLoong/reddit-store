It can ruin your entire experience and at 5k, not worth it.", "Honestly I'm more just floored at how low this price is ! 5k for up to 10 people ?!? Skipping all the lines and front row seats ?? How ?? Just a normal day at the park with that many people and whatever that new genie thing is that replaced fast passes and a meal and snacks for some probably costs that much alone. Where did you find this amazing deal ?!!? My twin and I need to make this a combined bday gift for our Disney obsessed nibling !!!", "Unless the rules have changed you can absolutely swap people for other people at random times during the day as long as the guide in never responsible for more than 10 people at at time (source was a vip hostess for almost a decade)", "I say YTA for trying to dictate how your bil enjoys his trip. You say you want to ride the rides with him but he obviously doesn\u2019t care about having that experience with you guys. He would rather spend this trip with his girlfriend and he would rather her son get that experience since 1) the kids a kid and would get more out of it and 2) it would probably endear him and the rest of his family (supposedly) to his girlfriend and her family. \n\nI mean what if he just says eff it and all three of them decide to go on their own without you all. Sounds like if you back him into a corner this is probably what he would choose. Like it or not he\u2019s committed to his relationship. He probably wants to get alone time with her which he might not get often because her son is around. Also, what kind of jerk would he look like to his gf and her son leaving them alone in a park to spend time with you guys when they were invited on the trip too? \n\nPlanning a Disney trip is hard enough. Stop being so controlling and you\u2019ll find that everyone will have a better time. The VIP tour is a flat rate for up to 10 so it\u2019s not even like you\u2019re spending extra money for the kid. But if he you don\u2019t let the kid go guarantee you\u2019ll have 9 on the tour instead of ten.", "NAH. You have the right to decide who's in your group. It's also reasonable for an adult to not care about going to Disneyland and to want to give the tickets to a kid who would.", "Whoop! There it is.", "Yep. You don't know this kid   he could be amazing or a brat. Plus what mother fobs her kid off on people she barely knows  that's an alarm right there", "And free babysitting from the people who paid for the trip.", "Thanks for responding, I agree, we've only met his girlfriends son twice and he is 7, so not the easiest age.", "Technically not his family till he puts a ring on it.", "Oh no, sorry it's not including tickets or food, so you buy the tickets and then it's $700 an hour for minimum of 7 hours and then plus tip and all the food costs", "Also you\u2019re absolutely not the AH and I misread that it was the gf son I thought it was your nephews gf but taking on an extra minor so their parents can have a Disney day F that!", "They will be stuck with taking care of the child of someone they don't know. \\\\\n\nNTA.", "But BIL doesn\u2019t need taking care of. If the gf\u2019s son goes instead, who is gonna take care of him?", "You are welcome\u2026 yeah 7 is definitely not the easiest age specially if you going to Disney and kids will want to run or try everywhere.\n\nIt would be unfair to have you basically babysit someone kids that you barely know. \n\nWould say to ask him again about it else, just say it\u2019s fine you would find someone else to take his place.", "Honestly that is still quite reasonable for all you are getting and especially if we can get a bunch of family on board. All of us cousins will have just as much fun as our nibling. With at least 7 of chipping in, spending 1400-1500 per person to celebrate this kiddo and give him a dream day is super doable - he's officially in remission and his immune system has improved enough that he's cleared to be a normal kid and experience being around lots of people for the first time in so many years (without having to wear tons of protective gear ! Front row to the shows AND line skipping ?!? Like I cannot comprehend how much my little bud would love and go crazy for this !\n\nWould it be alright for me to dm you to ask for some of the details on how I could go about purchasing a similar experience?", "Exactly what I was thinking.

Dm me and I'll send you the link!", "And that does sound absolutely amazing and totally worth it \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "NTA , if he\u2019s going to do that tell him that you\u2019ll find the substitute", "NTA", "BIL can refuse the ticket if he wants, but he can't tell you who to give it to. NTA.", "NTA- the brother in law is looking to dump the son on you and enjoy a child free day with his girlfriend", "So essentially, he wants you to **pay to babysit** his gf's kid for him so he can go off with his girlfriend separately. Just because you purchased a package for ten people doesn't suddenly mean his spot has zero financial value. He's asking you to babysit a kid who doesn't really know you on top of paying for the trip and any incidentals.\n\nIf he doesn't want to come, you can invite someone else or go without him. If you decide to babysit the child so he can have a weekend free with his girlfriend, ask him to pay for the portion of expenses that would cover the spot used by this random child, plus a babysitting fee for the inconvenience. Just because you were willing to cover him for a free trip does not mean you must be willing to cover just anyone for the trip.\n\nNTA\n\nEta: It's interesting that he thinks a 7 year old child who has met you twice is going to feel ok being thrown into your care with a bunch of other people they don't know for however long. That by itself can be very scary for a kid let alone being surrounded by strangers in a loud chaotic strange place. Clearly it's more about getting rid of the kid than who will enjoy the trip more.", "NTA. They can pay a babysitter and go on a date night that way and NOT use your Disneyland trip for that.", "NAH\n\nYou can decline to change the guest list. \nYour bil can decline your invite. \n\nYou just have to accept that your bil won't join and not starting drama over it. He doesn't have to join only bc you invite him and you want to have him there.", "NTA but do you understand that you will need to fill the spot if you do not let the child attend?\n\nIf BIL is willing to pay for two tickets for BIL and the girlfriend, BIL will either pay for the son as well or not go at all and find something fun for the lad that they can afford. You don't know the girlfriend or her son, but BIL does and obviously cares about them both just from your description.", "NTA. If he is refusin to go, good, its his choice.\nYou dont have to stik with someone you dont know ir her child.\nThis is a family trip and his girlfriend or her kid are not family.", "NAH\n\nI don't think anyone is an AH in this situation. Your BIL wasn't interested in this VIP tour with his mom. He'd rather spend the day with his girlfriend, and his girlfriend's son get the VIP treatment. You aren't OK with the girlfriend's son, who you don't know well, to have that experience. That's OK. But it doesn't sound like anyone is throwing a fit or anything. \n\nJust invite someone else instead, since BIL isn't interested.", "OP said in a comment that the child is 7 and they have only met him twice. They're effective strangers. \n\nSounds like a very stressful day for everyone involved except for BIL and his gf.", "Since bil mom also got a spot i think its not unlikely that the plan was mom watching the additional grandkid, though op doesn't mention anything. I'm pretty sure bil wouldn't have suggested this when not at least one adult his stepson is familiar with is there - and since op doesn't know them and mom seems to live near bil, this adult would be grandma.", "Yah, I don't think it's fair for everyone to be calling this guy an asshole for not wanting to go on a VIP Disney tour with just his \"real\" family when he has a step-kid who would probably die for an experience like that. Hell, I'd feel weird going to Disney without my little sister, and she's 17. A little kid doesn't really understand the context of an invite like this, he'd just feel sad and left out.\n\n But the people who paid for a VIP tour also aren't assholes for wanting to spend it with their invited adult guests rather than babysitting a kid they barely know. It's just an awkward situation all around, NAH", "Does your BIL like going on rides? Maybe he gets motion sick as an adult? Maybe he just wants this experience to go to someone who would really enjoy it.\n\nEdit: To clarify, OP is NTA. BIL might not be trying to be rude, he just might not want to go to spend a whole day at Disneyland", "No one gives a shit", "I also volunteer to help with trip planning! I don't work for Disney but love helping people plan special days :)", "You would be better served by getting a DAS pass (free) if the repercussions of his treatment would make it difficult for him to stand and wait in lines. Please investigate this first, there is a great chance that it would apply to his situation.", "You don\u2019t skip lines per se, you get into the LL. If that wait is 20 min, you wait.", "NTA at all, if you\u2019re paying it\u2019s your choice. I do kinda understand his intentions though. He\u2019s a grown man and probably not that interested in Disney Land but he can see that his partners son would absolutely LOVE it. I can imagine him thinking a swap isn\u2019t a big deal. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s an AH either.", "The whole time I was like weh now you have to babysit the kid while their parents are having their date. Idiiih", "NTA even if you were familiar with this kid, you'd be liable for anything that happens to this kid and have to babysit them during your vacation.\n\nwhy would this mother want to go to disneyland, without their child..", "NTA in a million years! You're forking out 5k not him. I think your BIL is looking at it as free childcare and time away from the kid for the day so him and GF can go around the place childfree. There's a slim chance he genuinely wants the kid to experience something like this as not everyone will ever have the chance to, but with him now refusing to go? Nah you're \ud83d\udcaf in the right here", "Why should you be responsible for a stranger's 7yo you've only met twice? \n\nYou're not his gf's babysitter. This child is not friends with your children. He's a stranger. And you're not obliged to give him the VIP Disney Tour. \n\nNTA", "NTA", "Or maybe BIL just thought the 7 year old child would enjoy the experience more. Not everyone is out there to just use other people, perhaps BIL actually had good intentions.", "Also when I was 7 I would\u2019ve been really uncomfortable if my mom left me with people I barely knew. Wtf?", "My guess is that BIL is pressured into it and GF won't let him go by himself.\n\nNothing wrong with asking, but saying he won't go at all after the no seems weird to me.", "You can't do the same stuff at somewhere like Disney land with a 7 year old, too much is age/height restrictive. You cop this if it's your kid, but no way should you be obligated to do it for someone else's kid, let alone one you've met twice. You're there to have a good time not babysit. Definitely NTA.", "Yeah but common sense lah. 7 year-old is usually a handful (I would know I'm a teacher) Plus they don't even know this kid. Not very bright the brother", "This is not BIL's step kid. It is his girlfriends 7 year old son. OP has only met him two times. \n\nAs a mother, I would NOT be comfortable with my child spending a day with a group of people they do not know. If the BIL was planning to be there, with my child, that would be an entirely different situation. However, BIL is just dropping the kid with his family and leaving. This is NOT okay. My 7 year old would be nervous and scared. They would not want to go. They would be with 9 strangers. Also OP would be responsible for a child they barely know. I would not want that responsibility. Pretty sure OP does not want it either.\n\nI do not see everyone calling BIL an asshole for not wanting to go with his \"real family\". People are upset with BIL for wanting to leave his girlfriends child with people the child barely knows.", "It's not a step-kid since he isn't married. Granted, we don't know how long he's been with his girlfriend, but it seems like not too long since the rest of the family barely knows her and her son.\n\nPlus, amazing experience or not, it's pretty weird for a kid to go with a bunch of adults who are virtually strangers.", "A 7 year old can't go on any of the good rides anyway, meaning OP can't when babysitting", "Oh yeah, OP doesn't know the 7 year old well at all, so it would be weird for everyone. But most likely the BIL just didn't think it through, but it doesn't mean he was thinking anything but the kid would enjoy the VIP experience more.", "NTA.  You made a generous offer to your BIL.  He doesn't want it, he wants you to take responsibility of his GF's son, a 7 year old, that you have met twice.  That's a big no, you don't really know this kid or even your BIL's GF, they just want someone else to look after her kid while they get free babysitting.  You are paying 5K for this tour and want to enjoy it without having to worry about the possibility of someone's kid you don't know throwing a tantrum and ruining it for everyone, invite someone else if BIL doesn't want to go.  I'm sure you have other family members who will appreciate it, or your MIL may have a suggestion of who you could invite.", "Yta. So you honestly think that he's going to just go to all of the events and the parade with you and your husband and ignore his girlfriend and future stepchild at Disney? I would definitely give up my spot for a child because they would enjoy it more and Disney is for kids. You do technically get to decide but if you denied the spot to the kid then I would also refuse the spot so I could spend it with my family. I get that you can only choose ten people but you do realize that you're excluding his family and no good parent would go off on a vacation and ditch their gf and kid?", "nta", "NTA.

You invited him. Not \"fill the spot.\"\n\nYou don't know the child.\n\nWho is supervising the child ? Oh yes. That would be you.", "NTA he wants to tour Disney with the girlfriend while you babysit. Find someone else to go with you.", "Absolutely not the AH.", "NTA\nIt\u2019s really rude to tell someone that paid for you to go, that you are giving your ticket to someone else. Don\u2019t ever invite him anywhere again.", "NTA\n\nKid is going to be upset and possibly ill-behaved without either of his parents with him. Yes, even if it is a VIP Disney pass. Also, babysitting a stranger's kid when you are meant to be enjoying your VIP pass is no fun.\n\nIf one of the invited guests wants to give up a spot, then BiL could babysit the kid as a guest, and the boy could go instead of that other guest. But I can't see anyone willing to give up their spot, and I can't see any good ways of raising the subject.", "NAH. You offered a spot and he declined. No one is in the wrong.", "NTA. You get to decide what to do with your tickets. Just invite someone else", "NTA\n\nEach and every single one of those 10 tickets that you're purchasing are your tickets.\n\nYour BIL was invited, he doesn't accept the invitation to be a guest on your ticket if he doesn't want to join you. However, the fact that he was offered an invitation doesn't mean it's now his ticket to give away as he pleases. It's not his ticket, it's still your ticket. You can invite someone else with it if he declines his invitation.\n\nI would now retract his invitation full stop. I can imaging him changing his mind to go with you then claiming an emergency 12 minutes before you have to leave, but don't worry, gf's son is right here available to go.", "So he wants you all to pay for and watch his girlfriend's son the entire trip so they can go on dates. I'd uninvite him from the entire trip and see if someone else was available. That's top shelf audacity. NTA. A seven year old you barely know! It's $500 for a stranger!", "NTA", "NAH. He can ask and you can say no. I imagine he thought a kid would have more fun on the tour than he would.", "NTA - you invited him and he didn't want to go.  Offer it to somebody else in the family.  I'll go !!!\n\nIts a pricey thing - you should maximize its use.\n\nI'm guessing GF made an issue of it, saying that he was less entitled to go than her son so he wouldn't be able to enjoy it because she will make a thing of it.", "NTA", "[removed]", "NTA - this isn\u2019t about giving the gfs son a special treat.", "I agree with this. I think they definitely want a \u201cbabysitter\u201d for the gf\u2019s child.", "I didn\u2019t know to tag along without at least one guardian who knows them", "AND pay for the privilege on top.", "He didn't really ask for a swap though. A swap would be one adult for another adult. He asked to give the spot to his girlfriend's 7 year old kid. So what he's really asking is for OP to babysit a kid they don't know all day at Disney while he & his girlfriend go around by themselves.", "OMG yes, NAH. I don't understand all these comments calling BIL the A H for making a suggestion.", "He is only 7? Dude, they're trying to pawn him off to you for babysitting.  The BIL can choose to forfeit his place, but can't ask you to pick someone else who is a stranger to you to go with you.\n\nThat being said, can I come tho? I'm a 29yo kid, so I won't cause that much trouble. And I promise to not make unreasonable demands of you. Lol.\n\nNTA.", "That makes it even worse. For some reason, I was picturing a young adult son, or at least, an old enough teenager that could reasonably look after themselves. The fact that it's a 7 year old child, tells me that this is more about your BIL & his gf trying to dump her kid on someone else, so that they can get a kid-free couples holiday, whilst the rest of you will basically have your VIP trip ruined, because you have to babysit this child that you barely even know.\n\nNTA. Stick to your guns. If your BIL insists, either find some other family member to join, or see if you can get some kind of refund or discount for the last remaining unused spot.", "NTA, but I think you might want to read that last sentence again.", "She did, the kid is 7", "I'm sure you have other family members who will appreciate it, or your MIL may have a suggestion of who you could invite.", "Yes, I\u2019d have cried. Many small children would if left with strangers. As if the op wants to spend \u00a35000 to babysit a child she doesn\u2019t know who might end up tearful at being away from his mother.", "You say this but she hasn\u2019t said how old her kids are", "Or he could have done it off his own back to look good to his girlfriend for getting her son this opportunity.", "Why assume he\u2019s pressured? I feel like I\u2019d give up my spot for a kid at Disney without any pressure, so that really might not be it frankly.

He might not be pressured at all, but that doesn\u2019t mean he gets to override the people who paid. (If I were him, though, I\u2019d just politely decline at this point, and stay with my \u201cnuclear\u201d family group if the GF is a serious one.

It\u2019s not a shock to me that the BIL might genuinely just *want* him to have that experience. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily him trying to pawn off junior and getting free babysitting as much as it is him wanting to include the people he loves in a family outing \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nI\u2019m looking at this the  way I would maybe try to approach it, and this would kind of be a compromise that I would offer. \u201cIt\u2019s not my thing, but GFs kid would really love to do this and if he takes my spot that\u2019s still a reasonable 3 kids to 7 adults.

It's honestly making me cry a bit - he had wanted a Disney trip for his make a wish but got too sick to go and most of the last few years it just hasn't been safe with his compromised immune system even if he had felt ok enough. But getting to take him as a whole family when he's healthy feels awesome. The other option we had was doing Greece since my twin sister, him, and I had the best time breaking out her classics degree and me reading myths very animatedly - so we'll just take him and our cousin sister (his mom) and her partner on  a separate vacation another year :)", "Totally a skip in my mind!

For him the more he can feel things are celebratory outings he can fully participate in as if he hadn't been sick, the happier he is. \n\nI and our family have had really positive experiences with Disney and accommodating for medical and disability needs in the past so we will definitely keep the option open !

Your trip sounds wonderful. If it were my son, and I could give him that opportunity by giving up my spot, it would mean the world to me to be able to do so.

He may not be thinking about how that affects the rest of the group (which I don\u2019t think makes him an AH, just not thinking about all the details) and that also makes you N T A. You\u2019re right to not want a child you don\u2019t know to join the group. From what I understand of these tours you\u2019re all together the whole time, moving very fast, and with little breaks to get from ride to ride. For a kid who, at that age, probably needs a lot of breaks that could be too much. You\u2019re also just fully allowed to not want to bring a child if you didn\u2019t invite them in the first place. They can be difficult (especially if you don\u2019t know them) and not wanting them there because that wasn\u2019t yours plan is reason enough.

There\u2019s an infinite number of enjoyable ways for a family to spend time together without *anyone* dropping five grand on something that some people straight up wouldn\u2019t appreciate or want to do. Now he is refusing to attend altogether which leads me to believe he does not actually want to go anyway, which frankly imo is valid. You can\u2019t force people to do things with you by holding a price tag over their head. \n\nAgain, I\u2019m looking it through my lens (which is all anyone can do without BIL coming in and explaining his side) and I can tell you that I would much rather have a kid or interested adult take my place on the expensive once in a life time experience. I also wouldn\u2019t appreciate the exclusion of my partner and her child - OP doesn\u2019t live in the state and can\u2019t speak to how serious that relationship is, so this could be the equivalent of leaving out a wife and child. \n\nAs I said - it\u2019s a NTA ruling from me even considering all of that because it is their money to spend how and on who they want, but I\u2019m not going to knee jerk and call the BIL an AH either.

Actually, I don\u2019t know anyone who would expect me to spend that much to give a child I barely know such an experience.  Maybe his motive was to give this kid that experience.  Maybe.  But he\u2019s also thinking he and his girlfriend can also enjoy a child free day at Disney.  Because asking for just this child to go with the group IS asking for them to babysit.\n\nInstead of accepting his brother\u2019s no, that his brother isn\u2019t down with accepting responsibility for a child he barely knows, he\u2019s refusing to go at all.  That\u2019s what muddles the motives.  That\u2019s what makes him seem entitled.  The BIL is not an ass for asking.

That is very uncool. Stick to your boundaries on this OP and ensure that this is a family event, and not a chance for BIL to leave a kid with you while he goes off and has an adults only day with his GF. If they keep pushing it, then I would either invite a family friend or just leave the spot unused (which would be a shame).", "Lmao so BIL wants you to babysit a child you barely even know so he can enjoy a couples date.

The fact that Gf is so comfortable ditching her child shows her character.\nEdit NTA", "NTA\n\nTo me the HUGE issue is that they are essentially foisting a 7 year old child on you which will enable them to tour Disney child free.\n\nYou will be babysitting a strange child who is probably going to have issues. Disney might be the happiest place on earth but having brought kids numerous times to Disneyland they get tired, hot, cranky and then start acting out because most kids don't handle being tired and physically uncomfortable that well. You would be feeding them and having to deal with any picky eating issues etc.\n\nIf they don't want the experience you are kindly providing then just find someone else to take their place who would be grateful and the three of them can do Disney themselves. \n\nHaving done Disney with kids and just with adults, doing it with a 7 year old is a completely different experience than just with adults. Most adults are not wanting to want on lines for Toon Town or Fantasyland which are necessary with a kid and you do for kids you love because you are essentially at Disney for them. You would also not be able to go on certain rides that have height requirements which are intended for adults and depending on the kid they might be spooked or scared of other more mature rides.", "NTA, you don\u2019t know the kid, and this was for decided guests. Also $5000. Damn. I\u2019ll come with if I pay my share and get you a drink.", "NTA. This is your event and you get to choose your guests.

Asking someone to watch a 7 year old they don't know for a day is asking a big favor.  Asking someone to watch a 7 year old they don't know for a day at Disneyland is a huge favor- even good kids can go crazy at Disneyland.  Asking someone who is spending a massive amount of money to have a great day with family to take a large chunk of time and attention away from that day to do YOU a huge favor when they were trying to do something nice for you is just a dick move.

Of course, I was already used to walking around Cedar Point from 9am until midnight at 7. I also was used to riding next to strangers. Also, I was a few years into elementary school which involved a whole building of strangers.", "That's not really the problem, if he doesn't want to go, he should say so and let op choose someone else.

Once he is told no, that should be it. There should be no need for judgment. If it were me and there were no one else I'd personally invite, I would just take 9.  NTA", "If the BIL is mad at OP for not taking the 7 year old, then he is absolutely the AH. But OP doesn\u2019t specify that in the post, she just says he\u2019s now refusing to go to Disneyland - so I assume he is currently saying that he doesn\u2019t want to go. Maybe it is a little rude to refuse a gift and not spend time with your family, but Disneyland can be overwhelming and exhausting, I don\u2019t blame him for refusing to go.\n\nAgain, OP is still NTA for not wanting to take the kid.\n\nEdit: And if BIL didn\u2019t want to go, I think it\u2019s fine to ask the gf\u2019s son can take his place, as long as he respects when OP says no\u2026 and OP doesn\u2019t specify that he\u2019s not respecting that", ">The overcrowded part is overcome by the VIP package\n\nThat's not the only issue, Disney in itself is shit. The park is terrible and you couldn't pay me to spend the day there.\n\n>Once he is told no, that should be it.\n\nThat was it. OP is the one dragging it on by not accepting the BILs no. He's not an AH for refusing to go as you just stated, OP is for insisting he go.", "Stop, you're being too sensible! /s  \nAnd that was my thought too. If I was BIL I'd feel so shitty enjoying enjoying something like that without my SO and their child.", "why would a child wanna hang out with strangers all day and why would OP watch her brother\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s kid on vacation\u2026. and you missed the motive of the original post, it\u2019s actually \u201cspend time with family that lives in another state\u201d", "NTA. While I get one BIL wants to do is nice, it's not his money or his trip.", "NTA - This is a really simple conversation. The spot on the tour wasn\u2018t for anybody, it was for you. We are spending this amount because we want to have the experience with you. It would be nice if we could include GF and her son, but that is not the case. If you don\u2018t want the spot we will find someone to fill it, but it won\u2018t be GF son, it will be someone else we know that would like to enjoy this. This has nothing to do with your GF or her son. This has everything to do with it being expensive, and us not wanting to deal with someone we don\u2018t know.", "NTA and in some way i feel like your bro in law and his gf are trying to get a free babysitter out of this\u2026even through they\u2019re literally going to the SAME PLACE", "NTA. You and your husband are the ones paying for the trip so it\u2019s up to you two who gets invited not your BIL. Besides you barely know the kid, what if he has an allergy or something that your not aware of or what if he randomly runs off on you (as some 7 year olds tend to do), heck the kid might not even be comfortable going on a trip like that with people he barely knows if his mom can\u2019t be around the whole time. I have a niece and nephew that age and they definitely wouldn\u2019t like it (or worse he will say he is fine until the trip has already started and the full realization that mom won\u2019t be around hits him and then you have a scared possibly crying 7 year old on your hands) granted all kids are different so he might react completely differently but it\u2019s still another possibility. I\u2019m really getting the vibe that your brother in law isn\u2019t considering any of this and just wants to have alone time with his GF by sending her kid to the free VIP trip.", "NTA, read in the comments that he\u2019s 7 years old. Honestly even WITH the brother in law there that\u2019s an awkward situation. A 7 year old knowing none of the people he\u2019s going to be spending long stretches of the day with? Pretty sure he wouldn\u2019t be thrilled.", "Nah. But i kind of understand him. An adult man doesn't like disney that much. And that kid would love it. If i was him i would want to do the same. Making a kid happy. \n\nYou are saying you paid much for that gift. But not everyone likes the same things", "I don't see anything in your story that says BIL is throwing a tantrum about it. He's an adult who isn't that interested in going with you to Disneyland. Thought the kid would like it, so he asked. You said no. End of story.\n\nNAH. Unless he's doing more than you've mentioned. Or unless you're giving him a hard time about it. If you both accept each others' choices, it's fine.

If all you want to do is spend the day hanging out as adults you can do that literally any time and anywhere.", "Thing is, he can ask but if you say no, then he just has to accept it.  But the flip side is he doesn\u2019t have to go. Personally I would hate a day at Disney.", "NTA - your money and your decision. I can understand though that he doesn't want to be separated from his girlfriend. Plus he's putting her son in a really awkward position to be going around without his own mother. If you can't accommodate all of them, then they are free to do their own thing. It's probably better to let them do their thing and meet up when you can than have a big argument over all of this.", "Definitely NTA. You're paying for this VIP treatment and you get to decide who gets the pass not BIL.", "NTA\n\nYour BIL is being way too entitled \n\nHe wants his \"stepchild\" to go, then he must be responsible for EVERYTHING related to that child (Expenses, babysitting, etc.)\n\nThe offer was for HIM and MIL\n\nIf he still refuses to go then find somebody else to go in his pkace", "NTA\n\nYou were not the a****** for not wanting to babysit someone's random 7 year old.

It's a generous offer to your BIL, but unfortunately, everyone is put in an awkward position.  He may feel uncomfortable doing VIP while his girlfriend and her son won't get to.  I do think he would look bad.  I think he's making the right decision by not going.  It also makes sense that since you paid, you don't want this kid you barely know taking the spot.  Then you'd also be responsible for him.  It's definitely best to just accept him not going and find someone else to fill the spot.  Don't hold it against him.", "Going to go against the grain here and say NAH.\n\nIt seems like brother didn't want to go and was offering a suggestion for someone to take his place. He probably figures it would be a pretty cool experience for this kid, because not many people generally get this opportunity. \n\nThat being said, you are paying and don't have to take the kid if you don't want to.\n\nIt doesn't seem like brother is demanding or being rude. It just seems like he might not be into the experience, or doing it without his girlfriend or her kid.\n\nYou offered, can't force him to go.", "Which seems like it's probably fine with BIL. I'm not clear why BIL is the AH. Seems like a NAH situation. \n\nI assume BIL lives in California, since they said they're visiting him.

Not going to Disneyland is his right.", "BIL, GF and kid live in California, and I don't think it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for them.  I think OP is seeing this \"VIP experience\" from her own perspective.\n\nIf my brother were in town, and I didn't feel like going to the area zoo for the day, I'd probably be like, \"No thanks. Billy'd probably have fun if you want to take him along.\" And if they didn't, I'd be fine with it, catch up with them afterwards and just carry on.", "That would be NAH then! If there isn\u2019t an AH.", "For real. Plus living in California, Disneyland is probably not an amazing opportunity for BIL. It totally makes sense that he'd rather just not do the rides.\n\nHim basically saying \"I'm not interested, but if you're up for it I'm sure Joey would love to go,\" is pretty ordinary and understandable. \n\nIf BIL is throwing a fit, that changes things, but it doesn't look like that's the case.", "IDK. Technically, yes. They'd be watching him. But I don't see any reason to think \"free babysitter\" is BIL's motivation. It seems more likely that it's an amazing Disney experience, and he thinks it would be neat for the kid. If he wanted a babysitter it would probably be not much more expensive to hire a babysitter at home and go out with the GF than driving the kid out there, food money, etc. for the day. \n\nIt doesn't sound like BIL is throwing a fit or anything. He isn't really interested as an adult in a Disneyland day (nor would I be). The kid would be, so he asked. Was told no. That's kind of the end of it, unless there's more to the story than we're hearing. \n\nI suppose OP could mean something by \"refusing to go\" beyond BIL saying, \"OK.

I think just knowing him it might cause him more stress (when he was supposed to his make a wish trip he was worried he was \"gaming\" the system and that it wasn't fair ugh poor little guy breaks my heart) while being a vip would make him feel important, but I will have his mom talk to his therapist about it too since they're the best resource ! If I was buying this for myself fully agreed with you though - for the money it should be truly VIP. \n\nGone are the days back when my cousins and I were kids and we would right back in line after riding space mountain just to do it all again! Also no more fast pass kiosks - I cannot read road maps well but give me a trail map or badly drawn unclear NF backroads? I'm golden because of having to plan routes to hit the max rides and kiosks and make all the reservations in time ! It was an organizational feat what with like 9 of us kids and catering to everyone !", "Honestly- I doubt he would know. They have a call with the parent and then need to see the kid for a few seconds for a photo. You could let the cast member know 1:1 that he would be very reluctant to get special treatment - they won\u2019t say anything to him about it! Maybe at least worth having his mom discuss with the cast member to learn the process. I believe he would probably be none the wiser, to be honest.\n\nAgain- VIP is fantastic, but if he qualifies for DAS and he wouldn\u2019t realize the difference (you could even just say you bought a special pass), that $ could be used on other amazing things for his trip.   He will have a blast, I\u2019m sure!", "NTA -  but neither is he.  You are going with your husband, kids, MIL and cousins.  He is an adult.  He might prefer to have an SO there.  I wouldn\u2019t want to go with just my mom if I had a boyfriend.     I would refuse too.  He asked a question and you gave a very reasonable answer.  He is giving you his reasonable response.

If you have your own ticket you can take breaks or even just come for a half day. A lot of locals with passes only do half days in mornings or evenings because Anaheim gets very hot and no one wants to be in the sun all day. \n\nBut somebody who paid for a VIP tour and has multiple kids is probably going to want to make the most of it and so they\u2019d do a full day with very little breaks. BIL might be fine with Disneyland but doesn\u2019t want to commit to that.\n\nI dunno, maybe I\u2019m giving the BIL too much credit and he is actually throwing a fit. If he is, hopefully he gets over it and still meets up with his brother\u2019s family", "All OP said was they invited the brother, and then he asked if he can give his place to the kid. \n\nThe timeline isn\u2019t exactly clear, nor how much the brother committed at first, but I still don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable for him to make up his mind after asking once he\u2019s considered the situation."]}
