It can ruin your entire experience and at 5k, not worth it.", "Honestly I'm more just floored at how low this price is ! 5k for up to 10 people ?!? Skipping all the lines and front row seats ?? How ?? Just a normal day at the park with that many people and whatever that new genie thing is that replaced fast passes and a meal and snacks for some probably costs that much alone. Where did you find this amazing deal ?!!? My twin and I need to make this a combined bday gift for our Disney obsessed nibling !!!", "Unless the rules have changed you can absolutely swap people for other people at random times during the day as long as the guide in never responsible for more than 10 people at at time (source was a vip hostess for almost a decade)", "I say YTA for trying to dictate how your bil enjoys his trip. You say you want to ride the rides with him but he obviously doesn\u2019t care about having that experience with you guys. He would rather spend this trip with his girlfriend and he would rather her son get that experience since 1) the kids a kid and would get more out of it and 2) it would probably endear him and the rest of his family (supposedly) to his girlfriend and her family. \n\nI mean what if he just says eff it and all three of them decide to go on their own without you all. Sounds like if you back him into a corner this is probably what he would choose. Like it or not he\u2019s committed to his relationship. He probably wants to get alone time with her which he might not get often because her son is around. Also, what kind of jerk would he look like to his gf and her son leaving them alone in a park to spend time with you guys when they were invited on the trip too? \n\nPlanning a Disney trip is hard enough. Stop being so controlling and you\u2019ll find that everyone will have a better time. The VIP tour is a flat rate for up to 10 so it\u2019s not even like you\u2019re spending extra money for the kid. But if he you don\u2019t let the kid go guarantee you\u2019ll have 9 on the tour instead of ten.", "NAH. You have the right to decide who's in your group. It's also reasonable for an adult to not care about going to Disneyland and to want to give the tickets to a kid who would.", "Whoop! There it is.", "Yep. You don't know this kid   he could be amazing or a brat. Plus what mother fobs her kid off on people she barely knows  that's an alarm right there", "And free babysitting from the people who paid for the trip.", "Thanks for responding, I agree, we've only met his girlfriends son twice and he is 7, so not the easiest age.", "Technically not his family till he puts a ring on it.", "Oh no, sorry it's not including tickets or food, so you buy the tickets and then it's $700 an hour for minimum of 7 hours and then plus tip and all the food costs", "Also you\u2019re absolutely not the AH and I misread that it was the gf son I thought it was your nephews gf but taking on an extra minor so their parents can have a Disney day F that!", "They will be stuck with taking care of the child of someone they don't know. \\\\\n\nNTA.", "But BIL doesn\u2019t need taking care of. If the gf\u2019s son goes instead, who is gonna take care of him?", "You are welcome\u2026 yeah 7 is definitely not the easiest age specially if you going to Disney and kids will want to run or try everywhere.\n\nIt would be unfair to have you basically babysit someone kids that you barely know. \n\nWould say to ask him again about it else, just say it\u2019s fine you would find someone else to take his place.", "Honestly that is still quite reasonable for all you are getting and especially if we can get a bunch of family on board. All of us cousins will have just as much fun as our nibling. With at least 7 of chipping in, spending 1400-1500 per person to celebrate this kiddo and give him a dream day is super doable - he's officially in remission and his immune system has improved enough that he's cleared to be a normal kid and experience being around lots of people for the first time in so many years (without having to wear tons of protective gear ! Front row to the shows AND line skipping ?!? Like I cannot comprehend how much my little bud would love and go crazy for this !\n\nWould it be alright for me to dm you to ask for some of the details on how I could go about purchasing a similar experience?", "Exactly what I was thinking. I'm not babysitting a stranger's kid at Disney. \n\nNTA.", "Yes of course! Dm me and I'll send you the link!", "And that does sound absolutely amazing and totally worth it \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "NTA , if he\u2019s going to do that tell him that you\u2019ll find the substitute", "NTA", "BIL can refuse the ticket if he wants, but he can't tell you who to give it to. NTA.", "NTA- the brother in law is looking to dump the son on you and enjoy a child free day with his girlfriend", "So essentially, he wants you to **pay to babysit** his gf's kid for him so he can go off with his girlfriend separately. Just because you purchased a package for ten people doesn't suddenly mean his spot has zero financial value. He's asking you to babysit a kid who doesn't really know you on top of paying for the trip and any incidentals.\n\nIf he doesn't want to come, you can invite someone else or go without him. If you decide to babysit the child so he can have a weekend free with his girlfriend, ask him to pay for the portion of expenses that would cover the spot used by this random child, plus a babysitting fee for the inconvenience. Just because you were willing to cover him for a free trip does not mean you must be willing to cover just anyone for the trip.\n\nNTA\n\nEta: It's interesting that he thinks a 7 year old child who has met you twice is going to feel ok being thrown into your care with a bunch of other people they don't know for however long. That by itself can be very scary for a kid let alone being surrounded by strangers in a loud chaotic strange place. Clearly it's more about getting rid of the kid than who will enjoy the trip more.", "NTA. They can pay a babysitter and go on a date night that way and NOT use your Disneyland trip for that.", "NAH\n\nYou can decline to change the guest list. \nYour bil can decline your invite. \n\nYou just have to accept that your bil won't join and not starting drama over it. He doesn't have to join only bc you invite him and you want to have him there.", "NTA but do you understand that you will need to fill the spot if you do not let the child attend?\n\nIf BIL is willing to pay for two tickets for BIL and the girlfriend, BIL will either pay for the son as well or not go at all and find something fun for the lad that they can afford. You don't know the girlfriend or her son, but BIL does and obviously cares about them both just from your description.", "NTA. If he is refusin to go, good, its his choice.\nYou dont have to stik with someone you dont know ir her child.\nThis is a family trip and his girlfriend or her kid are not family.", "NAH\n\nI don't think anyone is an AH in this situation. Your BIL wasn't interested in this VIP tour with his mom. He'd rather spend the day with his girlfriend, and his girlfriend's son get the VIP treatment. You aren't OK with the girlfriend's son, who you don't know well, to have that experience. That's OK. But it doesn't sound like anyone is throwing a fit or anything. \n\nJust invite someone else instead, since BIL isn't interested.", "OP said in a comment that the child is 7 and they have only met him twice. They're effective strangers. \n\nSounds like a very stressful day for everyone involved except for BIL and his gf.", "Since bil mom also got a spot i think its not unlikely that the plan was mom watching the additional grandkid, though op doesn't mention anything. I'm pretty sure bil wouldn't have suggested this when not at least one adult his stepson is familiar with is there - and since op doesn't know them and mom seems to live near bil, this adult would be grandma.", "Yah, I don't think it's fair for everyone to be calling this guy an asshole for not wanting to go on a VIP Disney tour with just his \"real\" family when he has a step-kid who would probably die for an experience like that. Hell, I'd feel weird going to Disney without my little sister, and she's 17. A little kid doesn't really understand the context of an invite like this, he'd just feel sad and left out.\n\n But the people who paid for a VIP tour also aren't assholes for wanting to spend it with their invited adult guests rather than babysitting a kid they barely know. It's just an awkward situation all around, NAH", "Does your BIL like going on rides? Maybe he gets motion sick as an adult? Maybe he just wants this experience to go to someone who would really enjoy it.", "No one gives a shit", "I also volunteer to help with trip planning! I don't work for Disney but love helping people plan special days :)", "You would be better served by getting a DAS pass (free) if the repercussions of his treatment would make it difficult for him to stand and wait in lines. Please investigate this first, there is a great chance that it would apply to his situation.", "You don\u2019t skip lines per se, you get into the LL. If that wait is 20 min, you wait."]}
