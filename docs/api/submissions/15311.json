He got invited to a birthday party the other day and he wore a full 3 piece suit, mind you he\u2019s in the 8th grade and he had just received the 3 piece suit for his own birthday. The party was all boys and they all dressed likes boys in athletic shorts and T-shirt\u2019s, but my kid is in this 3 piece suit. I was nervous about him wearing the get up but he wore that suit with confidence and totally pulled it off. When I picked him up he even said that everyone said he was the best dressed there. My kid also is quieter and really only has a few friends that I know of. He\u2019s not super social, but the way these kids embraced him was heartwarming. I was so glad I didn\u2019t burst his bubble by saying he shouldn\u2019t wear the suit and instead I told him that he looked great. I think you need to let your kid express themselves however they feel. This might be a great chance for him to stand out and make a very memorable moment out of this event. YTA, but you mean well.", "You won\u2019t let your son do a harmless funny joke because you want him to fear the possibility of being laughed at? What a terrible lesson! YTA.\n\nLet him do it.

Then take him out for a fancy dinner and enjoy that tux to the fullest.", "Your kid is trying to define his own personality and image. This is a good thing - don't suppress it.\n\nFirst off, there is no outfit in this world that EVERYONE universally loves, even the alternate you've suggested.\n\nSecond, you're trying to minimize his visibility because YOU think all that extra attention sounds like a bad thing to YOU. But that attention might be exactly the thing he loves. \n\nThird, kids need to start being responsible for their decisions at some point. Maybe he will regret the tux, maybe he'll love it.

Kids compliment them on looking sharp.", "YTA. Get him the tux. Get him a top hat and a cane too if he wants. Take a picture, he may never wear one again. A tux is a mood and a statement, he\u2019ll enjoy his joke and he won\u2019t have to see the other kids till school starts again, why are you worried about one day at the end of the year when he wants to end the year with style. Kids that went all out with their joke outfit never got teased for it, it was the kids who were forced into wearing something their parent wanted that did- because they were miserable and it showed.

If you weren't able to afford the rental, that would be another story, but just telling him not to do it because YOU'RE afraid that he'll get singled out for it kind've shows that he's introverted because you've probably helicoptered him for the last 10 years.

When I was in middle school one of the coolest kids in my grade showed up to the halloween dance year after year with coordinated costumes based on a pun. We all loved it. Another kid showed off his ginger hair by dressing up as a leprechaun. We earned each other's respect by not taking ourselves too seriously.\n\nYour son's right that it will be funny if he shows up in a tux. And I bet other kids will find it funny too. Of course, if you're worried about fees for renting a tux it's a different story, but if money isn't the issue here, then let him express himself! YTA", "Jesus, reading your comments to people is enlightening.\n\nYou speak as if as a kid, you're either charismatic and popular, or a total loser. \"He's not the life of the party and has a few very close friends.\"... Okay? So he sounds absolutely normal- just a kid, who doesn't stand out, and has his own group of friends with their own jokes. So like, most people.\n\nWho cares if people laugh at him when he's in on the joke? His friends will laugh with him, and others may laugh at or with him too. He knows, that's why he wants to wear it. Stop teaching your kid to worry about what other people think of him, especially other 10 year old's. Let your son have fun. And the way you describe him so negatively is so unnecessary- build your son up, stop knocking him down. He's not going to be bullied just because you seem to think everyone else would bully him- news flash, most people (children included) aren't bullies. Maybe you were, but most peoples first instinct at seeing a classmate dress up for fun isn't to mock them when everyone knows its a joke. Maybe he'll think it was a cringe thing to do years later, but 1- he's 10, we all have cringe memories from then, and 2- if the memory's a good one, it doesn't matter.\n\nP.S- telling another parent that their kids friends was probably talking shit about him behind his back is... hoo boy. *Enlightening.*", "A short sleeved dress shirt with a tie???

You say he\u2019s not the life of the party, and has very few friends. This is something that not only would make him incredibly happy, but would also get him *more* friends. This isn\u2019t the 1970s anymore, where you could get made fun of for wearing something slightly out of line. Kids these days respect each other more then you think, and this will make your kid the life of the party. I feel like you\u2019re worrying more about your own image instead of his happiness. All you should care about is making your son happy and letting him experience life for what it is. If he wants to wear a tux, then let him wear a tux.", "YTA. I teach 5th grade. If a kid whose normal clothes are t-shirts and shorts shows up in a tux the last day, people (definitely the kids) will get a huge kick out of it.

Gonna go with NAH because there are legit concerns and the son has every right to ask to be dressed a certain way but that doesn\u2019t mean that his family can afford it. Y\u2019all he is Ten years old, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s prom.

It might go better than you think.", "YTA - your heart\u2019s in the right place and it\u2019s great you care about your son, but clothing\u2019s a big part in how we express ourselves and it\u2019s a big part of many people\u2019s identity. You shouldn\u2019t stop him from wearing clothes to school because you fear he\u2019ll get bullied; especially if you told him that and he still wants to go through with it. Bad experiences are kind of essential for learning how to navigate all sides of human connection, and he\u2019s going to have them eventually one way or another. \n\nEven if he\u2019s telling you it\u2019s a joke, one day it may not be, what then?", "NAH. He just wants to have a bit of fun, and is reacting in a predictable way for a 10 year old boy when denied. Nothing wrong with denying him either, but IMO not for the reason you gave. Obviously, drawing attention to himself is what he wants. Pointing this out to him as a reason for saying no isn't something he'll find convincing. To me, it's more to the point that tuxedo rental is not a trivial expense -- you can expect to pay $100-150 or more -- and we don't indulge a 10 year old's every costly whim.", "Yta, i don\u2019t know if you had a bad experience in school or what but it\u2019s really not as big a deal as you are making it.

He died that day at 17. And everyone at that school remembered him because of that suit he wore and how happy he was. Even the bullies felt sad for him. Let him wear the suit.

Her father only makes her when he feels like it on his weekends so sometimes. So at my house she fights taking baths. Growing up, my mother only gave us 2 baths a week until puberty hit (ours were at 9) and she never explained how that would change and why. So I was like \u201cnope not gonna do it\u201d.

So I wasn\u2019t about letting that happen with my kids and it didn\u2019t. I had started that with my granddaughter until my daughter got pissed at me when I told her she had to follow my rules or leave (she was an adult but just barely.
