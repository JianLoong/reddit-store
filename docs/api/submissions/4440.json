So I think I'm just shocked? There's very specific instructions on what should happen to my uncles' shares if they die before the distribution of the Will and how their children should receive and manage their dad's shares, but because my dad is already dead and my inheritance would be a reality rather than a hypothetical, it feels like my dad was written out of the Will so that I didn't get significantly more than my cousins.

You can't really fight it just accept it and move on.", "I do completely understand why you're upset and I sympathize with you. My father died very young also last year,and im 27, but did outlive his parents. I knew there would be no inheritance for me and I guess I come from a POV that you should never expect inheritance nor count on it because it's their money to spend before their death and do what they will. Your dad wasn't left out, he was passed so there was no leaving out. You and your cousins had a 15% and your uncles happened to now get more of their share 80% share because your father is passed but it's still the same breakdown between the age groups. But also even though your uncles are in their 60s they could have 10 to 20 more years of life left. I get your hung up on how the split went and your feelings are valid but from how it was broken up it does seem fair to me and I reiterate that you shouldn't have had that expectation. I never expected to inherit my fathers portion of his inheritance from his parents that was 100k and i didnt. From what im understanding though, you don't feel supported by your family. Seperate that from the money. If you want support from your family ask for it. I dont know the dynamics of your family but don't let the money stop you from asking for support. I don't think you're an AH, but you had expectations you probably shouldn't have and im sorry that it happened like this.", "Yeah, I don't mean to sound entitled because I know not everyone gets left something in a Will and my granddad did love me.", "The Will isn't something I'm willing to fight, as I said in my main post.

And I do fully understand that and don't think I should be receiving my dad's full share as it would feel rotten for my cousins (and I don't want to hurt my relationship with them). I think I'm just stuck on how it's arranged so that I'm the only one who wouldn't receive their dad's share because my dad was already dead. If my uncles died tomorrow, their kids would get their share and it feels kind of like being punished for having a dad that died young. Which I'm aware it's not a punishment and my granddad adored me and my dad.

You see that there was a fair split that would have gotten you a bigger share. Absolutely true. And totally useless, it only poisons your mind.\n\nWhat you need to focus on is whether the actual split is fair from any perspective (yes, it absolutely is*), and whether you can manage to adopt one of these perspectives as your own.
