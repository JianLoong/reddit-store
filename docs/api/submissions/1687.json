This is some crazy logic from your girlfriend. It's nasty, to me, to use someone else's spoon but cheating. And you have to apologize or she's ghosting you?

I often share food like that with those I'm close to, as well. It's a norm for a lot of peopl;e. Also, even if some might think it's bit gross/unhygienic or whatever (which is perfectly fine view to have, as well), almost no one would call it freaking cheating.\n\nAbsolutely NTA.\n\nThe fact that she stormed off like that abruptly, too.
