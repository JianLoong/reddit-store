My sister offered me a spoonful of her ice cream to try, and I accepted. Then, my girlfriend immediately stormed off the store and called an Uber to get her home. We couldn't follow her because we hadn't paid the bill yet.\n\nLater, she sent me an audio message saying that eating food from another person's spoon is an indirect kiss and, therefore, cheating. She would only agree to talk to me when I am ready to apologize. It has been two days, and she's still ghosting me.\n\nI talked with a few friends about it, half said we did nothing wrong, and the other half said it was gross but not cheating. My parents say I should be the bigger person and apologize for hurting her feelings. AITA?\n\n\nUPDATE:\n\nMy girlfriend called me and explained herself. She's \u201chalf-Korean\u201d (her parents immigrated from South Korea). Like many Redditors commented, they seem to have a concept of \"indirect kiss\" that is non-existent in western cultures.\n\nShe apologized for ghosting me and promised never to do it again (she was crying and seemed sincere). Hence, I will give her another chance. We had a heart-to-heart conversation about our boundaries and things that were hurting us, and we both compromised on a few things. I won't be sharing utensils with other people anymore. I don't think this is a big request, and what was bothering me about our fight was how she handled it.\n\nThanks to everyone who took the time to judge my case.", "created_utc": 1667810737, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yoh30c/aita_for_eating_ice_cream_for_my_sister_spoon/", "score": 958, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I took a drink of my daughter's iced coffee to see if I liked it, and I would dare someone to say something sick like that to me.

She's making you out to be a bad guy, for? what reason? Maybe she's looking for an excuse to fight with you or break up with you? Her reasoning for being angry is off the charts bizarre.

Shame on your parents.", "this can't be real.....", "Omg, that is insane!

That was a HUGE overreaction. I\u2019d call that a red flag, please explain that that\u2019s your SISTER and that\u2019s just a family thing.\n\nAlso, why do people think it\u2019s gross?

This is the type of crazy that only gets worse. You should be so so thankful she isn\u2019t talking to you anymore.", "NTA\n\nRun. She is clearly unstable.", "NTA\n\nLet that fish go bruh.
