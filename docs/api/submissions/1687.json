And who knows what other unhinged crazy things she will come up with. \n\nalthough I do get the other friends sides with the it is gross thing, just because I have a thing about eating after anyone who isn't my husband lol. All because I don't know where their mouths have been lol", "Your girlfriend is whacked.  NTA", "NTA, I would share food with my brothers who I'm fond of and not think for a second that it was indirect smooching.  I've never heard that theory before.  Also her storming off is not a good omen.", "NTA wtf? apparently I've been cheating on every partner I've ever had by \"indirectly kissing\" all my friends and family when i try their food/drinks (and vice versa). this is so weird and the insecurity is a huge red flag. i'd count your blessings and get out now, this is some psycho shit. next she'll be saying you're \"indirectly\" fucking your sister by giving her a hug or some shit.", "Please be fake", "Nta. Your girlfriend is out of her mind.", "Nta That girl is nuts. You can do better!", "NTA Run like the wind bullseye", "NTA\n\nBro what the fuck is that logic?", "NTA. Run.

What a petty thing to get butt hurt about! And sorry, your rents are wrong - it's one thing to unintentionally make someone uncomfortable with something legit and to apologize bc it is wrong, but holy hell sharing a spoon with your sister is NOT along those lines - so no, don't apologize, RUN from this girl.", "NTA.  Her behaviour is too ridiculous for words - what kind of crappy reasoning is that.  Best to drop this one as who knows what other kind of nonsense you are going to have to put up with.", "NTA\n\nThis one is a whole bag of crazy I've never heard before! Siblings,  friends,  children.....I guess I've indirectly kissed them all!! Geez, your gf is a hot mess! My husband and I have a best friend couple we go out to dinner with once a month. My friends husband frequently orders the new beer and almost always gives me a sip to see if I'd like it. My hubby gets a sip too, so I guess it's a 3some kissing with the wife left watching!\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23", "Nta, this is one of those times life is giving you a massive warning flag. \n\nRUN. DON'T WALK, RUN!\n\nthe fact they instantly went to cheating cause you accepted some ice cream off a spoon from your sister is messed up. \n\nYour parents are out of line telling you to apologize, you should ask them, if it starts there with you apologizing for hurting her feelings for doing something harmless, where does it stop?", "Suit yourself. You did nothing wrong. That isn\u2019t cheating. It\u2019s your sister for gods sakes.", "Wow, she's being totally unreasonable. You are NTA and don't apologise! It would just be feeding the crazy. \n\nShe may not be a keeper, OP; if her ideas are that wack is she really someone you want to spend lots more time with?", ">Later, she sent me an audio message saying that eating food from another person's spoon is an indirect kiss and, therefore, cheating.\n\nAs you know, no it is not. A kiss is a kiss, and a spoon is a spoon. They have different names because they are different things.\n\n>She would only agree to talk to me when I am ready to apologize. It has been two days, and she's still ghosting me.\n\nWell that makes it much easier. She chose to stop seeing you. Just send her anything you need to like a sweater she forgot in your closet and move on. \n\nThank goodness you learned about her difficulties with sanity so early on. I shudder to think what could have happened if you'd had children with her before you had ice cream together.", "\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\u23f3\u231b\u26b0\ufe0f", "\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9 NTA", "Sounds like she might be projecting cos she kissed someone else....", "NTA\n\nWhat in the actual fuck is your girlfriend thinking?

Am I not allowed to share ice cream with my 6 year old son then? \n\nYour gf is crazy and I would walk away before she accuses you and your sister of wanting to create an art studio together", "Holy crumb cake, I\u2019ve committed adultery. I\u2019ve cheated on my husband with my sisters, nephew, daughter, granddaughters and bloody hell I\u2019m not sure but does a fork count? because I have been pretty loose with my fork.", "huh\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nalso NTA", "NTA Your GF is insane.", "Might want to kick the parents in the butt too \"are you really encouraging me to apologize to this monkey circus and set me up for always apologising for breathing near a person?

But that doesn't seem to be the case here. OP's hopefully now former GF is just weird or has seen too much porn.", "I agree.  I\u2019m a germaphobe so I could get it if she was a bit mad because sicknesses or something.

Or no?\n\nIf we take turns and not all go at once is that okay? I assume spoons making contact are obviously not okay. \n\nWhat about nachos and other finger foods? Where does the cheating start?
