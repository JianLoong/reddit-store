But for looking down on renters, that\u2019s elitist and gross", "Depends on the level of noise but I'm going with YTA because I know what it's like to live next door to a kid who makes unreasonable amounts of noise.\nYes, let kids be kids and they're going to be noisy when they play outside. I get that and agree it's good for them to burn off energy playing outside, and I'm not asking for silence or even no yelling. But the death metal screaming and shrieking, it's just on another level. It's not normal sounds of kids playing! These kids sit outside and have a competition to see who can scream the loudest. I can't even sit in my own garden anymore and I can hear them from anywhere in the house, even with the windows shut. Summer is unbearable. Sweating inside with the windows shut to keep the unbearable noise out.\nAll it would take would be for a parent to stick their head out and say \"Guys can you tone it down a bit?\" when it gets ridiculously loud. It's what my parents did if we were getting too rowdy as kids. You couldn't have even done that? \nBut parents sometimes don't see their kids from an outside point of view. Love can be blinding (or deafening, in this case!). What is reasonable to you could be horrendous for those around you.", "NTA for having kids play in your yard. They\u2019re children, of course they\u2019re going to be loud and play. Especially on a weekend.\n\nBut slight YTA for telling her that she\u2019s just a renter and is going to be evicted etc.\n\nYou can think that to yourself yeah, but to say it to her face is a bad move on your part.", "ESH. It\u2019s the weekend and kids are expected to play, but your view on renters is vile. And I say this as a homeowner.", "You said what I wanted to say. Renters are people too. They\u2019re not beneath property owners.", "Currently dealing with this bullshit and constantly being shot down with \"let kids be kids!\". I get it, kids can be loud when they play outside. I'm not asking them to be silent and a degree of noise is expected. But this kid next door to me is on another level.\nI'm talking death metal type screaming. We share a wall and it usually starts around 8am. Wakes me up every fucking day. Then he and his little friends go outside to the trampoline and continue yelling and death metal screaming. Genuinely, one of their games is to see who can shriek the highest and loudest. I can't sit in my own garden in nice weather and even inside, I can hear it wherever I am in the house. If I want any quiet I have to leave my own home! The noise is not normal kids playing noise.\nThe parents don't seem to notice/care how bad it is and never tell them to tone it down. I wonder how it isn't pissing them off too but I guess parents are just hard-wired not to be as affected by their own child's behaviour! Either that or they leave the house while the kids are \"playing\" in their garden!", "My brain broke trying to understand your writing.", "Aren\u2019t you a renter?"]}
