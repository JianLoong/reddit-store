That is a whole other matter.", "Attitude towards renters sucks, but as long as noise wasn't during noise ordinance hours, you're NTA for allowing the kids to keep playing", "Hello\u2764\ufe0f Would you like to be my text buddy and someone I can talk to, $500 twice a week you don\u2019t have to pay any fee before you get your allowance and I don\u2019t need any of your bank info\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70?", "NTA", "NTA for kids playing but YTA for being demeaning to renters.", "Where on earth did she even hint at classism or socioeconomic status? You can\u2019t just make up a narrative in your head and base your opinion on that.", "Couldn\u2019t agree more! I\u2019ve been renting for 7 years in the exact same apartment\u2026 It\u2019s a condo, not a box OP.", "That comment doesn't make them an asshole \nSincerely, a renter", "You have to possess the mental capacity of a stepped on worm to not know this is satire/sarcasm/a joke. Even without context it is very very VERY obviously poking fun. Why is everyone on this site such a mental black hole?", "You don\u2019t say someone is \u201cjust\u201d a renter who isn\u2019t really part of the neighborhood if you don\u2019t have some element of classism going on.", "It's literally in the judgement bots precis. Are you saying the bot is telling lies?", "And some property owners are below renters. Like those who live on the first floor of a multiplex", "I wish i could upvote this twice", "And backyard pools in Toronto in March/April being an actual possibility makes your intellectual capacity about the same.", "I suppose it could be interpreted that way but I don\u2019t really see it. If someone I had never seen before came up to my front door and started demanding I change things about my lifestyle to accomodate them as a (assumingly new as never seen before) renter I would also be confused as to why they think they own the street without properly living in it first. I guess you could call it classism but it could also just be called the reality of the situation. Just my opinion tho. Thank you for taking the time to explain.", "Dude the neighbour came over and started berating them\u2026. Like fuck I\u2019m going to entertain any of their requests, he was also backed up by another neighbour, how is it not a red flag this psycho came across the road to yell about kids playing ON THE FUCKING WEEKEND but it\u2019s a red flag that someone isn\u2019t going to listen to someone screaming and demanding like a child. Your opinion is ridiculous and completely one sided. Get off the internet and get some perspective. Jesus Christ.", "> judgement bots precis\n\n...what?", "Try a dictionary.", "I don't understand why neighbors won't come over to deal with problems. Yelling isn't helpful, but talking to someone in a reasonable tone seems, well, reasonable. \n\nKids need to learn how to live in their society. And parents need to model how to do that. I can remember my dad talking to the neighbors over serious things and everyone got along well enough. I've done the same with my neighbors and it seems to have worked out. Renter or owner, everyone should get the chance to be heard. \n\nBut there's always that one person who's wrapped way too tightly. For me it's my upstairs neighbor. Fortunately she rents out her apartment. Yay!", "NTA about the kids but a major, snotty AH about the renters comment.", "You had me until the end.\n\nYTA for your shitty ass elitist attitude. Having more than other people/owning property does not make you better than them! Glad you don't live in my neighborhood! You should be ashamed of yourself.", "NTA. I have sensory issues with kids screaming because I'm ND and you know what that is not? Any kid's fucking problem. They're just being kids.", "NTA, they were playing during the day. The woman had no business coming over, let alone yelling at you when you answered the door.", "NTA better to out this person in their place now else she will keep coming anytime you make any noise...and likely to everyone else in the area too.", "I actually HAD the police called on my little girls and I for playing in OUR backyard because the girls were laughing too loud.  They are really young little girls and I have actually videotaped them running, playing and laughing for when they are gone.  If you have little girls you know how they giggle at the silliest stuff....   The police actually laughed and went over to talk to the 'debbie downer' next door about letting kids be kids.  If it was 6 am or 11 pm it'd be different, but 10 am????  NTAH", "ESH. The neighbor is over stepping but YTA for your damn attitude", "Noise ordinances are set for specific times, like between 10pm and 8am, During the day she has no say!", "We rented a house when we first moved and there was construction going on next door. They used to park in our driveway and block us in and they'd start construction at 6am instead of town mandated 7. Any time we complained to them, they'd tell us the owner (who didn't even live in the US) told them it was okay. So it was okay to block our cars in so we couldn't leave for work. Yeah. Awesome. Never want to rent again. It sucked being treated like that.", "you stop after being the one who has to mow it", "Apparently some people here don\u2019t know how sound works.

I still want a backyard again.", "All of that is irrelevant.", "dont get me wrong i enjoyed it as i was doing it but sometimes when your doing you just get annoyed.", "sure", "You are not wrong. But it has nothing to do with a renters investment in a neighborhood.", "Im sure it not everywhere, just going by my experience.   \nRenters dont invest their own money into the property generally. The people renting the homes tend to want to put the least amount of money they can into the home as well. So they start to get run down vs homeowners who actually live in their home."]}
