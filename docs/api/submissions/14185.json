I asked where she lived since I\u2019ve never seen her before. Turns out she lived in the condo literally across the street from my backyard. It was the weekend and kids are literally playing everywhere here since there\u2019s a public park less than 500 yards away. I told her that kids are just playing and I\u2019m not going do anything about it. She threatens to call the cops and I tell her to go for it, my neighbour besides me came up and also backed me up.

I might have called the police on her and told her to not trespass on my property again though. I've had ah neighbors like this before. Luckily she's a renter, so potentially short term. Maybe you could give her landlord a call as well.", "I was with you until you got to \"just a renter with no permanent place in the neighborhood\" hahaha. So her opinion on the noise level of shrieking children does not count? It makes me question whether it was really just this one time that your children were being disruptive for her to lose it like that. \n\nESH.", "NTA.
