Kids are loud and annoying,  be a good neighbour and keep them quiet ffs.", "I agree with a lot of people here that it doesn\u2019t seem like you were TA until you thought less of her place in the neighborhood because she was a renter. You know renters can spend long periods of time in a neighborhood right? And that it is still their home area too regardless of how long they stay there? ESH.", "NTA - weekend noise is normal. Birthday parties don\u2019t happen every weekend either. Unless the noise is truly out of control, your neighbour can chill.\n\nYTA for your comment about renters tho. She lives there too whether she owns her property or not, and in fact, she PAYS to live there just as any owner would with a mortgage. She\u2019s just as entitled as anyone to be upset about her quality of living being affected. \n\nThis is coming from someone who owns a condo facing neighbours with a backyard. Don\u2019t know if they OWN their property, but I expect common decency among neighbours irrespective of them being owners or tenants.", "NTA", "NTA. I'm glad the kids had fun.", "Jesus Christ. YTA for your dumb entitlement. Who cares If she\u2019s \u201cjust a renter\u201d she pays to live there.\n\nYou\u2019re also an AH for NOT SUPERVISING SEVERAL CHILDREN THAT YOU CAN \u201cBARLEY HEAR\u201d WHEN A POOL IS INVOLVED!!! how many children have to drown before y\u2019all get it.", "NTA for letting your kids play on a Saturday afternoon.  \n\n\nFor saying \"just a renter and has no permanent place in this neighborhood\" you are definitely an AH. This is going to be hard to believe I know, but renters are people too and should actually be treated the same as homeowners. Crazy, right? Welcome to 2023!", "Op seems to just have a thing against women in general based on his comments on other posts", "NTA for letting kids be kids during the day, but you are an AH for talking about renters not having a permanent place in the neighborhood or like they don't have a say in the happenings of their community. By saying she has no permanent place, implies you think home owners own the neighborhood. You don't . You own your little piece of the neighborhood. I've rented my house for nine years, and I'm very much a part of my community!", "YTA for your view on renters. Some people have been completely ousted from any chance of home ownership. They don't deserve to be treated like transients.", "YTA. Renters have rights too.", "NTA. She rents. She can just move.", "NTA. Even if the kids WERE LOUD, it doesn't matter. They're kids and frankly, if I have to chose between 3 hours of traffic noise or 3 hours of kids noise, I prefer the latter.  But then, they were having fun for less than an hour and she came \"screaming\"???? Wish her a nice life, shut the door and ignore her.", "ESH. Renters have as much right to peace as homeowners. You don't own the streets either. However, her reaction to kids playing and making noise during the day is probably out of line. As long as it's not over a certain DBS, the cops won't do anything anyway. They may ask you to quiet down, but they won't arrest someone for just making noise under a certain level.", "More info: were kids screaming in the pool? I\u2019m a parent and loud fun was always allowed, screaming was not. Screaming is for emergencies only. Blood or bears were the only excuse for screaming. (We lived rurally). \n\nAlso your view on renters is not cool.", "YTA!! Have your rugrats under control! Nothing gives you OR your kids the right to disturb others, regardless of them being renters or owners. Noone cares that the kids were \u201cjust playing\u201d! Wtf \u2026. So my dog shits on your porch and I\u2019m like \u201cchill it\u2019s just poo, you don\u2019t own my dog\u201d", "I want to say NTA, but damn, what do you have against renters?", "I was with you until your last sentence.  Why would a person paying rent to have the rights to live on a property have fewer rights than an owner?  \n\n\nESH-kids playing during the day and not breaking noise ordinances are something that should be tolerated, and your attitude of 'I am a mighty owner, you are a lowly renter, you are less than me' is BS.", "YTA for not supervising the kids while they were in the pool. Drowning is silent.", "YTA for the horrible things you said to your neighbor, the classist views you hold, and changing your post to makes yourself look like less of an asshole. You suck, dude. Just let the kids play. You owning a home in a housing crisis doesn't make you better than literally anybody.", "Well you aren't TA for your position on not stopping kids playing. I think you were perfectly right, and your neighbor was being unreasonable (and possibly deranged).\n\nHowever, \"She's just a renter and has no permanent place in this neighborhood...\" sounds a little... well... \n\nWhat did you mean by that when you said it?", "ESH", "NTA. She's completely out of line. What a miserable person.\n\nMaybe take a moment to re-evaluate your derision for renters, though?", "Come here to ask if they\u2019re the AH over kids being loud.  Gets dragged because they\u2019re an AH in virtually every other metric than the question they asked about.\n\nPerfection.", "NTA for not stopping the kids from being loud outdoors, but YTA for shaming someone for renting. Not everyone is fortunate enough to be able to own their own home. Get over yourself", "YTA I hope people read the summary so they see what you actually said about renters before you edited your post because so many people were calling you a classist AH.", "ESH. Excuse me, but what the hell do you have against renters? Have you seen the price of houses these days? Some people stay in their rented homes for longer than their neighbors own the homes next to them. I was with you until the end, but your attitude is so unbelievably classist and judgmental I\u2019m floored. It makes me think your kids likely were being rude and too loud (yes, they can be too loud, even outside.)", "ESH It seems unreasonable to get upset about rare kid playing sounds when you live closely to other people. Also, the idea that a \"renter\" should be less annoyed by the sounds because they're not \"invested in the community\" is ridiculous. I don't think house ownership status should have even been a consideration in this sort of issue because it's literally NOT about community investment AT ALL", "ESH, her for screaming at you, you for demeaning her and doing nothing. You could easily have had a word with the kids and ask them to keep it down a bit, just to be a good neighbour, as it is obviously disturbing her. Yes, she shouldn't have shouted at you, but people don't tend to do that without good reason. You say you could barely hear the kids, but it's well known that parents become immune to the noise their children make, they only hear things that are different or out of the ordinary.", "Gah you were so close. \n\n>she was just a renter\n\nYou complete snob. \n\nNo judgment because I can\u2019t be impartial towards a snob", "I too saw old comments under his profile and he's really an AH across the board. Referred to a mom pushing her kid in a stroller as a \"fat mom.\" He's an AH with poor grammar, which, as most of us know, is unsurprising.", "Bump this for OP hiding the edit", "I 100% agree with your statement\n\nHowever I think Op is just a big ol troll. All of their previous posts show them living in the Toronto area (southern Ontario in Canada) and NO ONE in southern Ontario has their pool opened yet.

And Toronto is SOOOOOOOoooOooo much better than Saskatoon. We have so many bars and cute stores in downtown. I love my 500 sqft condo. Also we have diversity which is the most important*", ">she's just a renter and he's no permanent place in this neighborhood\n\nFuck OP", "Reading through their comment history, they have a couple of other demeaning views. And are almost obsessively anti-car?", "I mean, it's a asshole view but it's not part of the situation that we are asked to judge here.", "I believe the reason they point out \"Just a renter\" is that they are not invested in the area and may be gone within months. I've lived in the same house for decades and yes I do view renters as not equal neighbors vs ones that have been around as long as I have.  Has nothing to do with social economic status, it has to do with longevity and investment in the neighborhood.  \n\n\nMost problems we have had in my area have been renters who destroy yards, have aggressive shitty dogs, etc.", "Socioeconomic status doesn\u2019t even have to come into it\u2026.a lot of people rent because their jobs are temporary.   A lot of professionals work contracts that are for a set amount of time (6 months, 1 year), and choose to rent a nice place for the duration of their contract.", "This was my concern!! Let the kids play, but kids in a pool need to be supervised. If OP can \"barely hear them\" from where they are, that's dangerous.", "maybe the noise level is the reason why the tenants apparently change so much?", "I live down the street from an elementary school, and you can hear them yell and play from my backyard. I cant imagine the level of noise constantly happening next door!", "I used to live in a apartment complex right next to the pool. I had to buy earplugs because I worked nights and kids would be so fucking loud, like screaming right outside my window.", "Just curious my dude, why would someone choose to rent vs owning if they had the money to own? Aside from old age what would be the logical reason?", "Perhaps you should live in the country or the woods somewhere? Kids area allowed to play, and even allowed to make noise.", "OP's a D and his comments on his profile are gross.", "Is there any way to see edits on Reddit?", "Hey guess just because you own your house doesn't mean you own the street or have a permanent place in the neighborhood! What a jerk you are.", "Honestly I know this is going to be an unpopular opinion, but - and it depends entirely on how unreasonable the noise level was - the neighbor can't be wrong here.", "Oh come on.

In that time the units around me have been bought and sold multiple times.

Of my top 3 worst neighbors, 2 were owners.", "I\u2019m not a renter now, but I was for a decade.  I still treat everyone on my street as equal citizens of the block.", "The funniest part about your comment is you are a renter yourself. Did your manager tow your truck and put up those posts because you as a renter thought it was ok to park a truck in the backyard of your shared apartment?", "Rip your karma", "Lol, maybe!
