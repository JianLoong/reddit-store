I tip rather generously as a rule on the rare occasions I go out, but I'm not ever going to ever try to make up for other people's actions that I have no control over. \n\n\nInstead,  I've actually got up from my table, hunted down managers or the head person in charge to TELL them how their servers are being treated by customers.  That's the ONLY way to enact actual change. Servers can only say so much, but when another customer comes to their side, it has far more of an impact.\n\n\n\nA good manager will find ways to relocate guests when necessary through diner attrition OR if a table is as poorly behaved as that family was.... kicking them out so someone else can be seated.  That's why notifying management is critical. There's far more power & options at hand than regular serving staff.", "NTA, and it is quite possible that the servers were happy to have a table of one to ease their stress on a busy night. If they reserved four tops for three or more people, they would have told you that.", "NTA. You didn't pick the table yourself as the restaurant picked it for you. Just because you dine alone doesn't mean you aren't worthy to dine in-house. Go you! Lots of people are too afraid to dine alone. Keep doing you!", "NTA. Believe me, that woman would be mad and an asshole regardless. You did NOTHING wrong, and I hope the food was wonderful", "Was that woman related to Crazy Steve?!\n\nNTA", "NTA, for sure.", "NTA", "NTA. She was just entitled. Don\u2019t give her another thought- she isn\u2019t worth the energy!", "Would have been the last time she mouthed off...I have no problem putting people in their place..", "NTA. You're allowed to exist as a single person. Just because public things like restaurants may not be designed for solo experiences doesn't mean you should avoid those things. People suck. I'm sorry you had that experience.", "I didn\u2019t even have to read all of it. The host sat you there. It\u2019s not a bus or a subway. This older woman is unspeakably crass and you\u2019re at no fault whatsoever. End of story.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu are fine, they were the AHs.", "Nta. I feel like, no explanation necessary on my part.", "NTA. Even if you hadn\u2019t asked for the smallest table they had, you\u2019d still not be an ass.", "NTA - And the manager should have come over, not the hostess.", "NTA \n\nYou asked for the smallest table and got it. \n\nThey asked for the first available and got that. They could have waited longer but they chose not to. \n\nYou did nothing wrong. I hope other than the rude comments and getting assaulted it was a lovely meal.", "NTA.", "You should have been.  I would have poked the bear just to annoy them.", "Nta and please don't let this put you off going for dinner alone", "NTA. I think you were fine. I tend to overthink things, and when I am dining alone in a similar situation I over tip to help out the server that would normally be receiving tips for two meals for my table. (I don't over tip dining at the bar or in a sparsely occupied restaurant - just my standard 20%+.)", "NTA. It's not like you sat there for hours. You literally had your meal and left.You also asked for a smaller table/bar and they didn't have that. Not your fault. The lady and her family were out of line and downright rude.", "NTA!! I'm sure any server would much rather wait on you, then some uppity family. I'm sure you tipped well, and the family's tip was probably as good as their manners. I can also say (from personal experience) that whomever would not allow them to take the chair, was definitely doing so because of their attitude. Yes it is a hazard, but you let things slide when people are kind. Blatantly telling her no was definitely her way of saying fuck off.", "NTA. When a spit wad hit me in the neck, I would have called the manager over and told them about this aggressive act.  Quite possibly the family would have been asked to leave as they were already causing somewhat of a scene.  You deserved to eat in peace.", "NTA\n\nI do have social anxiety I would have for sure cried, and then never gone out to eat by myself ever again. Hope you continue to enjoy yourself and not let stupid people ruin your day.", "NTA. Nope,Nope,Nope. You have every right to go out to a restaurant and enjoy a nice meal. That person was completely rude and entitled. I'm glad the resturant staff shut her down.", "Nope. You are allowed to be in a space. She\u2019s the entitled AH here. NTA.", "NTA. Single people are allowed to enjoy restaurants too. It\u2019s ridiculous to expect single diners to get their food to go. You should have told that db to F off\u2026the spitball with the straw wrapper would have been enough for me to show them what FAFO means", "NTA. If the restaurant sees it as a problem, they can either do bar seating or get some smaller tables. This woman's entitlement is not your problem.", "NTA", "NTA. You tried to get into a smaller table and there weren't any. You did your part. Those people were being rude and entitled. In other countries other single people or a couple would be allowed to sit at the table with you. It's the restaurants job to sit people where they want them.", "NTA the restaurant sat you at the table, it\u2019s not your fault. And that woman is an AH who isn\u2019t used to not getting her way", "NTA.  Single diners are fine.   You have a right to exist.  If the restaurant has a problem they\u2019ll seat you at the bar etc.  \n\nI don\u2019t think restaurants like dramatic a h like that other table either.  Demanding and probably tip poorly.  I\u2019m sure they much prefer a quiet polite regular customer.", "Clearly nta, you are allowed to eat alone at a restaurant. You were seated there. You did nothing wrong. The rude family did everything wrong. They are TA", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would very much have enjoyed ruining her dinner. Selfish in her world apparently only applies to her and her family not other people.", "NTA, you payed for the seats", "The entire problem could have been avoided by better management on the part of the restaurant.  The family being nasty to you were jackasses though.\n\nWhat restaurant does not have seating for couples?\n\nWhat restaurant can\u2019t move an unused chair for extra seating IF the extra chair won\u2019t hinder traffic.\n\nWhy did the hostess seat a family of five at a table for four instead of telling them to wait? \n\nWhy did that family covet your table for four when they were seated at a booth for four.", "nta", "NTA You decided to eat out by yourself. She s acting like you caused World War 3", "I used to get off work at noon on Fridays. As a working mom, I loved bringing a book to a casual restaurant and reading peacefully while I ate. The only problems that happened would be when Bertha and Elmer would be seated near me and start talking to me: \"Aren't you lonely eating alone? Would you like to sit with us? Please join us! I don't think I can eat, watching you sit there all alone.\" \n\nNo matter how many times I would insist I was happy reading my book, they would persist until I would finally snap on them and disengage, and they would sit there, looking hurt and offended. Hey, people, NO means NO. Seriously.", "I vote for this move.", "If the manager didn't kick her out for continuing to harass me after the server/host warned her to stop, I sure wouldn't want to be there anymore. I certainly wouldn't be interested in giving the place more cash to let some horrible woman hassle me for having the audacity to eat at a restaurant.", "I mean it was a Culver's tho... A family of 4 would have gotten up and given you their table and sat on the floor if they had seen that you needed a place to sit \ud83d\ude02 #midwestnice"]}
