It\u2019s never an issue for me since I am usually sat at bars or at a table for two. recently I wanted to go to a new place that had opened in the area. I went alone and but the hostess lead me to a table for four. I asked if they had smaller tables or a bar to sit at since I didn\u2019t want to take up a spot for larger groups. She said this was their smallest table and they don\u2019t do bar seating. The restaurant wasn\u2019t super busy, but definitely picking up as it was dinner time. \n\nWhile I was waiting on my food the attendance picked up big time and there were people sitting outside waiting. I noticed at the host stand an older woman, man, 2 younger adults and a kid were crowded around and the woman pointed directly at me. I tried to ignore it since my food was about to come out. \n\nWhile I was eating the group from earlier were sat in a booth not far from me. The lady who pointed at me made a loud comment about how selfish young people can be. How some people are so entitled they take things from others without a care. Then I felt something hit my neck, it was a wadded up straw wrapper. I turned to look where it came from and noticed everyone at that table was glaring at me, except the kid who was oblivious. I wouldn\u2019t say I have social anxiety but I am non confrontational so I went back to my food. Then the unthinkable happened. The lady came over and asked for one of the chairs at my table saying they squeezed 5 into a booth and just wanted a chair for the kid. Before I could get an answer out since I was chewing a server walked by \u201coh no ma\u2019am we can\u2019t have the chairs moved around. Safety with the walkways.\u201d \n\n\u201cWell why does one person need 3 extra chairs? I have a kid suffering and his parents horribly uncomfortable because you sat one guy at a table when you could\u2019ve just given his food to go!\u201dthe server told her she needed to sit back down but she kept ranting \u201coh I\u2019d love to sit comfortably at a table too big for me! It must be so nice knowing I\u2019m ruining another families dinner!\u201d At this point the hostess interjected and the server left. The hostess tried to shoo her back to her table but the lady kept demanding an extra chair. \u201cMa\u2019am you told us to sit you in the first table that opened. The manager and I told you it would be a squeeze and you still wanted it. Either you take this table or you can leave.\u201d The lady finally grumbled her way back to sitting and I finished my meal, paid, and got the hell out. \n\nShe was definitely unhinged, but I\u2019m stuck wondering if I\u2019m the asshole here for taking up a space meant for more people.", "created_utc": 1674920002, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10nhrhx/aita_for_taking_up_space_at_a_restaurant/", "score": 36, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The hostess knew you were alone and sat you at a 4-top because they don't have 2s or bar seating. They can't reasonably turn you away for being alone or force you to have takeout. The family squeezed into a booth was in the wrong before throwing the wadded up straw wrapper at you.", "No NTA - you asked for a smaller space and did your due diligence to try to accommodate others, if the restaurant couldn't seat you somewhere smaller, that's on them.

I've worked in many customer service jobs, and in restaurants as a hostess and busser, and I'm glad those workers were able to help you out. \nBut also look at their actions, it was automatic in them to correct this lady. They didn't hum and haw about it. You could've been alone or on a date, and she'd have still gotten the same reaction from employees. You literally did not a single thing wrong. \n\nI go out to eat all the time alone, and I've never experienced something like this, so I hope that the experience doesn't stop you from going out. It's one of my simple pleasures to stop in, eat at my own pace in silence, pay and get out.  People generally don't care. The ones that do, well customer service also taught me that I have no idea what someone is going through at home. You did not cause her to blow up, something else did.", "NTA. You are good. If the restaurant's smallest table is a 4-top, then that's the smallest spot they have for fewer than 4 people. The hostess seated you there - where else were you to sit? You are allowed to eat out alone, and I don't mean take out. I'm actually impressed about the server not allowing the chair at the end of the booth - she's right as far as safety and walkways. The server and the hostess handled this very well. My only issue is with the straw paper - I AM confrontational, and someone at that table would have been wearing at least a glass of water in retaliation ;).", "NTA, she\u2019s the one everyone was wishing would leave, not you.", "NTA. That lady was super unhinged. She should have gotten kicked out for harassing you. It\u2019s not your fault that they didn\u2019t have smaller tables and you were seated first. There\u2019s nothing wrong with going out to eat alone.", "NTA. You sat where they seated you. You didn\u2019t demand the larger table. She was the AH", "HUGE NTA This person asked for the next available table. They made assumptions about you being entitled because of your age, all the while, behaving like a creep, permitting spitballs to be spewed from her table. I wish management would have tossed her out. You paid for your meal, were courteous and did nothing wrong.", "NTA *at all* and please don\u2019t let this deter you from eating out alone. It\u2019s one of my favorite pasttimes. \n\nThat other table had issues. If the server sat *them* why didn\u2019t they deduce that the server sat *you* too? What idiots.", "NTA\n\nThey sat you there. It's the restaurant that is taking the loss here. This lady is clueless if she thinks you magically \"took something from her\".\n\nSounds like she graduated with a degree in Karenology.", "Why would you be the problem? You were sitting where you were seated. Definitely NTA.", "NTA. You asked for the smaller table and restaurant didn't have any. And the Old lady & her family are the AH and they were the one acting like idiots and are a Major AH for disturbing you during your dinner.", "NTA\n\nThat lady and family seem like AHs in general, that kind of rudeness and entitlement isn't a one off.\n\nYou did nothing wrong, the restaurant chose to seat you, so they saw nothing wrong with it either.", "Obvious NTA. Don't let people like this get into your head", "NTA - If you were a table of two and a four top, they would have said the same thing. You are a customer, no more than they are.... and you have better manners.", "NTA - you\u2019re a paying customer. You, as a party of one, get to take up a whole table just like any other party would get a whole table. \n \nWhat, people are supposed to only get take out and eat alone at home like hermits if it\u2019s just them? No. \n \nEating a nice meal in a restaurant by yourself is enjoyable. It\u2019s normal. It\u2019s fun to do that sometimes and that woman was so incredibly weird and strange about it. Makes no sense. \n \nI\u2019d have spread out like I was in a lounge chair and stared her right in her face as I sipped my drink. \n \nAlso I hope that restaurant comped your dessert or something for the trouble. Not that it was their fault, other than they should have intervened more adamantly if one of their customers was being harassed.", "NTA. People travel alone for business and other reasons, and they need to eat, too.", "NTA", "NTA at all", "NTA", "NTA, and (for anyone who has not worked food service) I can ASSURE you that sitting 5 people at a typical 4 top square table ALSO would have been very uncomfortable and potentially cause aisle-way clearance safety issues.  \n\nThe restaurant may not have authorized that, they likely permitted the booth situation if it was a small child and everyone could be seated within the confines of the booth.  Of course, this assessment is situational, based on the size of the tables/ chairs/ spacing, but very likely assuming typical restaurant configurations.", "NTA. At all.", "Absolutely NTA, you did everything you could to be considerate to others (which btw is more than most people would do), don't let entitled people make you second guess yourself, you had just as much right to be there as anyone else and providing appropriate seating is the restraunts problem", "NTA. Im the first place that woman was incredibly rude and entitled. In the second, if there was a problem, it\u2019s the restaurant\u2019s responsibility to sort it out.", "You are not the asshole.", "NTA.  The hostess put you at the table.  Servers and hostess tried to rein in this insanity.  She probably acts this entitled everywhere she goes\n\nKeep going out and enjoying yourself.", "NTA. That\u2019s where you were seated. Had you demanded a large table all to yourself you would be TA. \n\nThe hostess explained the situation loudly enough for you to hear it for a reason. \n\nOld lady needs to turn her \u201centitlement\u201d speech back on herself.", "NTA. I can't think of a reason you'd think you were an a-hole here! You asked for a small table and you were told this was the smallest they had. She got the table she asked for. However, the restaurant should have bounced these people as soon as that straw wrapper hit you. That's assault. And yeah, this lady was totally unhinged.", "NTA at all. It\u2019s the restaurant\u2019s responsibility to accommodate different sized groups if they want to offer service, and the lady was absolutely ridiculous for blaming you for eating out - why didn\u2019t her family get their food to go? \n\nI do hope you gave the waitstaff a generous tip, though.
