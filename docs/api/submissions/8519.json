I tip rather generously as a rule on the rare occasions I go out, but I'm not ever going to ever try to make up for other people's actions that I have no control over. \n\n\nInstead,  I've actually got up from my table, hunted down managers or the head person in charge to TELL them how their servers are being treated by customers.  That's the ONLY way to enact actual change. Servers can only say so much, but when another customer comes to their side, it has far more of an impact.\n\n\n\nA good manager will find ways to relocate guests when necessary through diner attrition OR if a table is as poorly behaved as that family was.... kicking them out so someone else can be seated.  That's why notifying management is critical.
