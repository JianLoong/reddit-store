It was a rough set up. Your grandfather no doubt did his best as he saw it but just wasn't up to the task. As a result you ended up being relied on far too much without any appreciation which destroyed the whole set up.\n\nHe probably feels very bitter because he feels he tried his best. You need to put him straight every time he goes down that road because if you don't he will convince himself that he was in the right. You must tell him why he expected too much and why you left.

Sounds like a massive amount of sexism if they weren't asked to even wash a dish. I only ask out of concern for your younger sister - it's likely she's going to be stuck caring for a newborn and three adult men who won't help her with anything. I'd keep an eye on her situation and see about transferring her care to you (if that's possible and you are able/want to) if she gets the same treatment as you.\n\nI would also say, gently, that Granddad has been taking advantage of you financially. There is no way your car insurance should have been that much, and making you pay for everything when he was getting a carer's allowance for you is just unacceptable. He's been pocketing the money and working you harder and harder.\n\nAbsolutely NTA, you've done amazingly to get out.", "NTA.

You are a 'disappointment'.\n\nThe disappointing thing about you  is that you found your feet and you used them to run like hell away from this abuse.\n\nNTA. Never go back. You say you're told every time you speak to your grandfather that you're a disappointment and he'll never forgive your betrayal. You therefore have nothing to lose. Stop speaking to him, and block his number. If he persuades other people to harass you, block them as well.\n\nYou're strong, and tough, and brave.

The heck with them. They're your past now.", "NTA!!!!!!! You made the right decision.", "  NTA. Your grandad is disappointed because he lost you as cook & cleaner\\~not b/c you did anything wrong.\n\n  You are doing great!! You work, you bought your own car, and you have a great work ethic.

You are expected to do what seems like ALL the chores, work full time, pay car insurance, and pay rent.\n\nDoes anyone do anything for that household? Why couldn't either of your two  brothers do any cooking or cleaning?  Being pregnant doesn't mean you no longer have to do chores.\n\nI am glad you moved out.

Please stay away and do not let him abuse you anymore.", "i'm not sure about Aus, but is it possible to just go to the police and ask them for a temporary escort to your grandfather's property to claim your items as being held? i know over here sometimes they'll do that and just... be there to make sure you have access and aren't (excessively) harassed while grabbing your gear.", "I can promise you that life will only get better from here on.
