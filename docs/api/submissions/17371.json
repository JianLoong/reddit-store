You have had so much responsibility to deal with and are only 19. Sounds like you hardly had a childhood. Not sure why your other siblings can\u2019t handle cooking and cleaning, as well. Or even your grandfather, who was supposed to take care of you\u2014I mean, he could at least feed you as a minor. You are not betraying him. You deserve to enjoy life as others your age do. I really wish you the best.", "NTA however working from 6am to 6pm just to get by is not sustainable. You need to pick a career that will sustain you without having to work 12 hr days. You are a bit all over the place with the certificates you are getting. You need to go to your local community college and inquire about their programs and pick something that will allow you to pay your bills, invest for retirement and not work 12 hr days", "NTA. \n\nMy family fucked with me the same way. \n\nLike no I'm not your fucking slave", "NTA and please block your grandpa and go NC with him.", "Wow, NTA and I'm sorry this happen to you!\n\nI need you to read this carefully:  Your grandfather was financially abusing you.\n\nThe work you put in around the house would easily total more than whatever imaginary figure of \"rent\" he wants from you. It was HIS JOB to provide you with cooked meals and a clean house for shelter. He had the audacity to try and pawn his responsibility off on you. I'd suggest going 100% no contact. Block him on everything. He can stew in his bitterness alone.\n\nNo matter what he tries to tell you, he will always be the one who was in the wrong.\n\nSis, never look back.", "NTA!!!!", "NTA and please, in the name of all that's holy and a few things that aren't, go NC with these people. It may sound harsh but your mental health will thank you.", "It\u2019s been nice for your granddad to have a live-in slave. Congrats for getting out. He sounds toxic, sexist and abusive. Your NTA.", "He's a constant disappointment and I wouldn't forgive him for betraying you that way. Sorry you've been treated so horribly. NTA", "NTA.  They were taking advantage of you. They are just mad that they don't have a maid and cook.  CONGRATULATIONS for setting and keeping a boundary.. Move out your stuff slowly and get it out before they destroy or sell it.", "NTA", "NTA\nIf you have space to take all your stuff back or can afford a storage unit/Uhaul rental, you should get everything out and let that be the end of it. He isn't worth it. Depending on how you got your first car, whose name it was under, etc, you can go after him for lying and overcharging you for insurance and taking your car without splitting the worth of the car with you in cash.", "Family are the people you CHOOSE to surround yourself with.  \n\nHe's a relative, not family. \n\nGet your stuff and cut contact.", "He had an unpaid slave. You did the right thing getting out.\n\nNTA\n\nFamilies can be toxic.", "NTA I'm glad you got out of that situation everything is gonna be better!", "The solution may be to not speak to him, unless he's gatekeeping the rest of the family", "He bought the car for me but it was never in my name because insurance was cheaper for it to be in his name, they\u2019ve refused to give me back my birth certificate he quite literally said \u201cI paid for it so that makes it mine\u201d", "Yeah I know, I\u2019m looking for a fulltime job that pays more and doesn\u2019t have insane hours, my certificates are from high school I did hospitality and business for my senior years and beauty therapy is my own hobby and that\u2019s why I did business aswell, I want to become a makeup artist and have my own salon, the certificate in disability is because of the job I\u2019m in now, I work with disabled kids", "In Australia you finish school when your around 17-18", "wrong sub", "No what I meant is I was paying over $2000 a year for my car, now I\u2019m paying almost $1000 a year and I own a brand new 2018 sport car over my 2002 car, it\u2019s not normal to be paying over $2000 on insurance here especially for the car I had", "That's really fucked up. That said, you should be able to apply for a new one. Do you at least have your Social security card? That's the one I'd personally be more worried about.", "Ah, I was just wondering how you squeezed school in there as well. Still NTA.", "Not sure if it's the same where you are, but in Ontario, Canada, kinship placements get basically no money.", "This is awful and please don\u2019t feel bad or doubt yourself.", "Still, most lawyers will give you a free consultation. Centrelink or such might be able to give you resources. Anglicare and the Salvos have all sorts of programs. Honestly, just start making some enquiries, you never know", "I don\u2019t think here in Australia social security cards are a thing, never heard of them before nor do I know anyone that has one", "So many people just reenact their trauma/parenting with their own kids. It\u2019s sad.", "Thats super close though.", "There's no allocation for the kids??\n\nHere in Belgium, every kid gets a monthly budget, even if they're part of the cliche 2 parent, dual income household with white picket fence and golden retriever. IIRC the amount varies, but there's a minimum it can't go under. \nAnd that's entirely separate from things like reduced school fees etc. \n\nSo kin placements would get that money at least.", "Just adding my two cents as someone living in Australia. So, several years ago my bestie fled an abusive relationship. She took her 3 kids and basically only the clothes on their backs. The police advised her to find out when he wouldn't be home, and escorted her while she \"broke in\". They couldn't offer any other assistance", "Yeah I\u2019ve been in contact with them, just been waiting for a caseworker to get in touch with me", "Yeah, we have the Child Tax benefit, which works out to like $500-$5,000 per year depending on the family's income. I would imagine kinship placements would be able to collect that money. Standard foster care, however, covers the cost of having the child(ren) in your home; food clothes etc, even up to legal fees in certain cases. \n\nThe only kinship I have personally seen that has gotten financial help from the Society (our children's services in my area) was a very particular case with a lot of reasons to financially assist. And the financial 'help' didn't actually help much at all.", "Good! You should ask them to go with you to pick up your stuff!", "NTA. A betrayal to put yourself first.  Uh huh. He just mad you had enough balls to leave.", "NTA. Stop talking to these people who used you   Only go forward, never go back.", "I think you're a \"rock star\"! \u2728\nYou've obviously had a difficult life, and my goodness you're working your way out of it! Seems like you've done a lot for the family, and although I don't normally see an issue with paying some rent (as in a small amount of your paycheck) and doing some chores as an older teenager, having to buy your own food, and basically running the household is ridiculous. As is him saying your a disappointment! You're not You are a rock star \u2728 and don't you forget it! NTA", ">when I was 15 I got my first job and was made to have to pay for everything myself including my own food.\n\nThis right here makes you NTA. You were a servant. He's mad because he lost his servant. That's it. I'm glad you're doing well now.", "NTA.  Are you in an area where you can have the police/sheriff go with you to collect your belongings? Get out what you can and then go LC/NC.", "So he didn't just exploit you for labour, you also lined his pockets, while he pocketed all the money that was supposed to go for your care. Basically he got paid, then you also paid for the same thing, and then he got you to be his maid for free.  \nI have no clue whether it is possible to sue him, but I'd mention all of this to whoever you talk to at the children's care services, because this is not ok. (I am not a lawyer so I have no clue whether you could sue or not, but you might want to ask around.)", "Hey OP I\u2019m Aussie. We do not have social security cards, don\u2019t worry. You don\u2019t even need the original birth certificate, you can get a copy from births deaths & marriages. What will be tricky is identification to get it potentially. Do you have your own Medicare card? You need one. You have a license, so with that and a few other points of ID ie student id (assuming you e been doing tafe etc you may have an active one), statements from your utilities/bank, bank card etc counts towards it.", "My apologies. I sometimes forget not everyone on here is from the US. Glad to hear it's not something you need to worry about.", "I\u2019ve been using photos of my birth certificate with everything so far, I do have a madicare card and license and whatnot though I will have to look into getting a copy or a new one", "NTA\n\nGet our stuff and never deal with him again. Just because you are related to someone by blood does not make them family. It also doesn't mean they have your best interest at heart.", "NTA \n\nSo your grandfather and brother made you do all the *womans work* at 15 because you\u2019re the woman. And 2 jobs. \n\nPlease enjoy living with your partner and having a nicer life.", "NTA. You\u2019re not a disappointment at all - it takes great strength to stand up for yourself as you did especially when family is involved. Your solution is mature and rational and your grandpa should be proud that you\u2019re able to look out for yourself and don\u2019t let other people take advantage of you anymore.", "NTA have you ever ready cinderella? he's only upset becasue he lost his slave. you had to pay him? when the state did as well? I'd suggested calling CPS and reporting that to see what they think", "NTA.\n\nYou were being taken advantage of, and probably emotionally and financially abused. Your manipulative family is not worth keeping in touch with; they only want to get you back under their control.\n\nI'm glad you have your bf and his family to support you. Good luck OP. You are doing so well.", "NTA. I'm glad you were able to get away from there with no problems.", "NTA - get your things and cut contact. They are leeches, not family. Your family is the people who show you love and care, not treat you like a slave", "Cut him off and cut your losses on the possessions. You'll be happier long term.", "NTA - the only reason you\u2019re a disappointment\u2019 is because you\u2019re not doing what they want. \n\nBe you, reach for the stars, dream big and go hard. \n\nThis is your life and no one else\u2019s to live. You\u2019re the only one that has to live it everyday, no one else. \n\nFamily or not, people should be happy for the accomplishments and achievements you have. If they are disappointed in you growing, finding yourself, moving on in the world and becoming an adult, do you really want those vibes in your life? If it was a friend, would you keep them around only to be knocked back down every time?", "NTA, this situation sounds super abusive.  I am glad you are out and I hope there is a way for you to get your stuff... involve the police, even.", "NTA and\nI know I'm just some random stranger on Reddit but I'm proud of you. It's hard, it might get harder but you got this! Yes I know coming from having so little possessions are important but they are just things. I had to teach myself that. It would be awesome if you can get your stuff but at least you are not being taken advantage of and are safe. Maybe he'll come around maybe not.
