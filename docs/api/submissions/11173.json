I saw how bad it could be on someone and never wanted to be the cause of that. I'll try to portray the incident as best I can. I was visiting my parents and went into town to run a few errands. In town, I was approached by a man I didn't recognize. He was initially friendly and greeted me with, \"Hey, are you [my name]?\"\n\nMe: \"Yeah, I am. Do we know each other?\"\n\nDrew: \"I'm Drew Smith. We used to go to school together. \"\n\nDespite him saying otherwise, I couldn't recall anyone by that name. I responded, \"Hey, I'm really sorry, man, but I don't think I recognize you at all.\" \n\nI then started chuckling a bit out of embarrassment since I didn't know how else to react. I guess Drew didn't like that very much since his whole demeanor changed pretty quickly.\n\nHe then asked me much more coldly, \"Ohh, then I guess you also don't remember how you used to treat me like shit when we were kids, huh?\" \n\nThat completely caught me off guard, and I couldn't respond with anything besides a confused, \"What?\" \nDrew then started going off on me, claiming that I would purposefully exclude him when we were kids. I had convinced others to do the same and that teachers had to forcefully assign him during group projects because no one would willingly accept him. That no one would play with him during recess or after school, so he had no friends growing up, and it was all my fault. I was utterly shocked and denied it, stating I had never done that because I hadn't. \nThis just made him madder, and he started accusing more loudly, saying things like \"Yes, you fucking did!\" and \"Why don't you just fucking admit it already and just apologize?\" \nBy this point, we were getting people's attention, and I was afraid someone would call the cops. I decided to leave, but felt like I needed to get a jab in and said, \"Look, man, I'm sorry school was so shitty for you, but if you were anything like you are now, you probably deserved it.\" \nIn hindsight, I really should have just walked away, but I was getting angry myself, and it felt good at the moment. Drew started yelling after me even louder, but luckily he didn't try to follow me. When I got to my parents' home, I told them what had happened. They were surprised about the whole exchange too, and couldn't recall any friend of mine named Drew either. My mom then started teasing me a bit, saying I've always been pretty reserved, and if I was ever a dick to someone, they probably had it coming. Despite the reassurance, I can't help but feel kinda guilty about the whole exchange. Drew was absolutely convinced that I was his childhood bully for some reason, despite me not remembering him at all. Seeing how worked up about it he got, should I have just pretended to apologize or something? It seemed to me like it would have at least avoided that whole fiasco, even if I'm sure I had nothing to do with it. Was I the asshole in how I handled the situation?\n\nEdit: I was asked by some users to include that Drew never mentioned the school we went to together, just that we were classmates. Also that he only got my middle name right, not first or last. I haven't gone by my middle name since I was 6 or 7.\n\nEdit2: Another user, u/PreviousComedian4263 brought up kindergarten in an offhand way and it made me realize I do know Drew. We met in kindergarten where we initially started off as friends. I was also friends with a girl by the name of Alex. She also happened to be Drew's cousin. Like a few months into the year he started being a total shithead towards her, such as pulling her hair or trying to touch her to annoy her. I stopped being friends with him almost immediately and had nothing to do with him. The teacher tried to get me to be friends with him again, but I played up a language barrier between us to make her think I didn't understand her. She eventually dropped it. Other kids started doing the same because Drew starting throwing massive screaming tantrums whenever he didn't get his way. Eventually, no one wanted to be friends with him anymore and he was pulled from the class. That's why he only got my middle name right, because I started going by a new name the next year. I can't believe this all started over something I did as a 5 year old.\n\nEdit: Hey, thanks a lot everyone for the judgments. It gave me a lot to think about. Ultimately I think I'm going to agree with the ESH comments. Drew shouldn't have yelled at me like that, but I could have easily handled it way better than I did. Especially as I had the chance to make a clean break but instead chose to get my hands bloody with my last comment. There's no right circumstance to ever say someone deserves to be bullied. I apologize to anyone I may have offended with my last comment or what it could be taken to imply. I think I'm gonna sleep on it a little further, not really sure how to feel about the memories the whole thing brought up.", "created_utc": 1677634420, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11eqg3e/aita_for_not_apologizing_to_the_person_i_used_to/", "score": 3894, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The last comment was petty but again, it wasn\u2019t unprovoked.\n\nThe other thing is reading your comments if you really don\u2019t remember him in the slightest and all he could give you was your common middle name?

But if someone is claiming to have been ostracized by not only OP's friend group but by the *entire school* there might be something wrong.

You're grown adults now. Even IF his story were 100% true and even IF it were definitely about you, that doesn't excuse walking up to someone in public and going on a tirade, screaming at them, swearing at them and demanding apologies for something they've already said they don't remember. He had so many other options -- confront you calmly, ignore you, give you a nasty glare, ask you to go out and talk sometime, etc. He chose to verbally attack you in public. That would put anyone on the defensive, and I think spouting off something rude in response is understandable in the heat of the moment. It might not be ideal or the most kind way to respond, but I think it's more than understandable and not worth an A H judgement.\n\nI also think there's probably a lot more to his story. You may have been a part of his frustrations, even if you don't remember or even if you didn't know it/didn't mean to be. But for that many kids to conspire to never play with him or work with him ever, for years (such that he never had friends growing up), I highly doubt only you were involved (again, if it all). Most schools are way too clique-ish for one kid to have that kind of pull; even the most popular bullies have an opposite faction who can't stand them and wouldn't follow their lead. If every group hated this kid, that's even sadder for him, but that isn't your sole responsibility, even if you did exclude him at some point.\n\nLastly, I don't think a fake apology serves anyone.

Its a Dutch phrase, that normally wouldnt really be bad but my bullies turned it into a personalised insult towards me....\nAnd he said: I heard other people call you that and since its not an ordinary curse word or anything I didnt think there was anything wrong with me calling you that.

And that is the part that really fucked me up. But I have let go of that anger now because we were just kids, and I now have my own kids and I do not want to repeat the cycle of trauma with them. My father had a terrible temper as well as bouts of severe anxiety and depression when I was a kid. My mom also has pretty bad anxiety.

Am open with them about my issues and I work really hard to explain my feelings instead of yelling and am teach them to do the same. And I teach my son it is ok to be sad and happy and other emotions besides angry. \n\nBetween bullying, toxic masculinity, and my upbringing I had been robbed of being able to express anything but love, fear, and anger. In our house we make sure everyone feels safe to share and experience their full range of emotions as long as they do so peacefully. So when my son shouts and says he is angry, we often ask if he is actually sad, and that is usually what is going on when you get right down to it. I do feel bad for the guy that accosted you; he has a lot of work to do and it sounds like he hasn\u2019t started.

Drew sounds to me like he is going through something difficult in his life if he can be so angry with you over something that happened so long ago. I was bullied in secondary school (US high school equivalent) and it changed my personality and outlook, I never understood what I had done to make my friends turn on me and leave me friendless when I most needed friends, and years later these girls all added me on Facebook. I was in a good place when I accepted them and figured it was all in the past, but then another girl from our class wanted to organise a reunion. At the time I was going through a breakup and my outlook just changed and I realised I had no reason to want to be around people that had made my life hell at the time, so I removed them as facebook \"friends\" and declined the invitation. I was 13/14 when the bullying happened. I'm not in a bad place now, but I realise I still want nothing to do with those girls. They didn't add anything to my life and I rarely ever think about them except in moments where I'm feeling low anyway and wondering why I'm not always the happy go lucky person I once was. I can't even remember the face of my 5 year old best friend let alone anyone else, so he must have been seriously affected by what happened. That said I can't blame you for not remembering whatever happened or for your reaction to what was a very confusing situation. But if you did bully him, even many years ago, then I give you the ah title too. I read what you wrote about what happened when you were 5, and I imagine he remembers things very differently - the mind is a funny thing and we tend to justify things to ourselves and even distort memories over time. And apart from this he sounds like he needs professional help, yelling at someone you have not seen for years about something that happened when you were kids is both an ah move and very abnormal.", "[removed]", "I knew a girl in college who was a pathological liar who pitted people against each other, was super manipulative, caused drama on purpose just to watch the fireworks, and had an explosive temper.

I tried to be friends with her but she caused so many problems and lied about absolutely everything I could just never trust anything she said and she caused chaos abd hurt in everyone's lives. I eventually told her that because of her behavior I couldn't be friends with her. She then cyber stalked me for 8 straight years, alternating in between begging me to like her and telling me I'm a POS for not liking her. She ended up getting hooked on drugs and running over someone with her car and going to jail which she also somehow blamed on me even though I hadn't responded to her in years at this point. She accused me of bullying her, because I set a reasonable boundary with her.
