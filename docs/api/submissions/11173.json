Op is in ESH territory because of his comment but just because Drew felt he was being actively excluded, doesn't mean he was!\n\nIt could be that he was a shy kid who once tried to reach out to OP. Op might not have been in the mood to socialise and rejected the overtures. Maybe from that point in Drew's mind, all his isolation was OP being an evil mastermind.

After a dozen or so invites I started to feel like I was being a pest and figured he would engage with us if he was free.
