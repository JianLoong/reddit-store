{"id": 24222, "submission_id": "15ly0oz", "title": "AITA for screaming in church to avoid going against my will?", "selftext": "I (17F) recently found myself in a bit of a situation with my parents regarding attending church. So, some context: my family is pretty religious, and they've always wanted me to attend church with them. However, I've never really been into it and feel like I should have a choice in participating in religious activities.\n\nLast Sunday, my parents were adamant about me going to church again, even though I've expressed my discomfort with it numerous times before. I had reached a breaking point, and I felt like I needed to make a stand for my own autonomy. In a fit of frustration and defiance, I decided to let out a loud screech right in the middle of the church service.\n\nIt was honestly a spur-of-the-moment decision, and I didn't expect it to lead to such an outcome. My screech caused quite a scene, and my parents were mortified. People turned to look at us, and I could sense the embarrassment radiating from my parents. Long story short, we were asked to leave the church premises, and my mom was really upset with me. She called me a \"drama queen\" and hasn't really talked to me since then.\n\nHowever, here's where I think I might not be the asshole: despite the embarrassment and consequences, my behavior actually worked. My parents are so embarrassed by what happened that they've decided I won't have to go to church anymore. They're concerned about the negative attention and what people might think, so they've essentially banned me from attending church with them.\n\nOn one hand, I feel like my actions were justified in a way because they led to me finally having a say in this matter. On the other hand, I can't shake the feeling that I may have gone too far and caused unnecessary embarrassment for my parents.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA for screaming at the top of my lungs in the middle of church to avoid going against my will, even though it led to me not having to go to church anymore?", "created_utc": 1691537083, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ly0oz/aita_for_screaming_in_church_to_avoid_going/", "score": 123, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

At 17 OP should be allowed to opt out of religious services that they do not subscribe to.", "At 16 my parents weren\u2019t even allowed to see my medical records anymore without my permission. It didn\u2019t matter that I was a minor, because I was at an age where my medical records were considered mine, unless it was something absolutely dire. You will not find a judge who will force a 17-year-old to go to a religious service especially not in the US if that\u2019s where she is.", "Am I missing something here? I said they shouldn't have forced her to go to church? Describing a parent making a \"child\" do something they don't want to do, regardless if your 5 or 17, as disrespectful or immature wouldn't be my choice of words. But yeah, throwing a tantrum at 17 in a church by yelling in the middle of service, that's more along the lines of what I would describe as disrespectful and immature behavior.", "Yeah but the whole church wasn\u2019t her parents. \n\nINFO: OP is the church like, wildly homophobic or otherwise super shitty? Or just boring and unpleasant? If it\u2019s actively bad, NTA. If it\u2019s not your cup of tea, then ESH", "Both of those comments have nothing to do with OP  disrupting other people\u2019s time. I\u2019m sure you have a problem with OPs parents forcing their religion on others (as do I), so why are you doing too?", "Exactly!  I agree this is one snapshot, and as with all posts there\u2019s naturally context missing, but read like OP was a 12 year old not a borderline adult", "She\u2019s 17, she could just sit in her room and not go. I dont see any scenario where screeching in public as a 17 year old is a reasonable course of action unless there is an emergency.", "Was she physically picked up and dragged to church? She could absolutely have changed her parents' behavior by just not going. If they'd punish her for that, they'll punish her for this.", "She could have farted and blamed the Dad really loudly. Who doesn't laugh at a fart?", "She could have simply just not left to go to church? Ignore her parents and just sit in place at home. Sure she might get grounded or something but they can\u2019t physically force her to leave, even if she is 17 and still a minor. Would they just physically drag her into church should she decide to just not move? From them being embarrassed about her screaming, I think they would be more embarrassed if they had to drag her across the ground into the car then across the ground of the parking lot into the church and across the floor of the church to sit in the pews.", "Its a safe space for me to molest little kids - the priest most likely", "this is the 99% of time you shouldn\u2019t make a scene.\nAlso how does bringing one\u2019s children to church make one a religious idiot? You are aware the parents can do whatever they want to their children within the confines of the law as long as they are under 18 right?", "i love reddit. Remind me which group does the most humanitarian/volunteer work? You probably make a lot of posts to this subreddit since youre such an insincere asshole.", "Too many people legitimately believe this..", "Yeah, that other redditor sounds like the same kind of parent OP has. \u201cMy way or the highway!\u201d Lol", "Found one of the children struggling with thoughts of being unloved! \ud83e\udd23", "I think there are judges in a few states, including Texas and Arkansas, who would.", "I would have just frowned the whole time and rolled my eyes. Not making noise to disrupt the sermon but at the same time my attitude and facial expressions would embarrass my parents to not let me attend anymore.", "Yes, it does. Disrupting a bunch of sickos who condone child molestation doesn\u2019t upset me. Why does it upset you?", "Sounds like an excellent way to build up resentment.", "That's how parents end up hardly ever seeing their children. Because they're idiots who treat their children like objects that they can lug around where they want\n \nYou shouldn't breed", "You are getting way too butthurt over someone asking about whether they were TA over something\u2026 on the internet. \n\nUnfortunately humanitarian and volunteer work isn\u2019t enough to make up for how hateful you are. THAT won\u2019t get you into the \u201cHeaven\u201d you hope for. Giving love in one hand does not cancel out shitting in the other and throwing it at people. Sorry to break it to you.", "haha no way I was actually right about you making a lot of posts here.", "cant believe you would defend a 17 yo girl making a scene at a family outing because of her perceived \u201cindependence\u201d. See how far that gets her if her parents were non religious and kicked her out the second she pulled any crap like this. Now I see why reddit is called a liberal cesspool, you guys sure do love making more homeless drug addicts", "The Red Cross. But I can tell you which one is going bankrupt from all the child abuse cases against them.", "It\u2019s more like \u201cmy way or the live in the dirt way\u201d but I don\u2019t disagree with it for the record.", "okay. Define \u201cHateful\u201d and also\nFind the equivalent of throwing shit at people that Christians are guilty of. Reminder; intolerance isnt a sign of hate.", "Funnily enough most of the homeless drug addicts I\u2019ve met are also creepily and forcibly religious. Probably because when hope was lost, they needed something to hold onto and turned to religion. And what religion do we spoonfeed people in America? Christianity. \n\nKeep being an AH to people and you\u2019ll find out in due time where you\u2019ll go after you die.", "So your logic is she\u2019s the asshole because her parents in response could\u2019ve been terrible people and kicked her out of the house and making her a drug addict  ? Strange train of thought there\u2026.", "Intolerance is fine. You\u2019re allowed to not tolerate something. \n\nIt becomes hate when you start spreading and trying to apply your beliefs and intolerances to everyone. \n\nI\u2019m done having an internet argument with someone who thinks going out of their way to be rude to people, especially teens, is their ticket to \u201cHeaven\u201d.", ">Reminder; intolerance isnt a sign of hate.\n\nGoodness, that sounds exactly like someone full of hatred would say when they don't want to think of themselves as such, doesn't it?", "shes the asshole because shes a little screecher who makes a scene because she thinks she has independence, and as a result ruined her relationship with her family. In no situation is what she did a victory for anyone. Even if she didn\u2019t like it the best course of action would be to do the opposite of what she did. She\u2019s lucky her parents actually care about her", "also how would the parents have involvement in making her a drug addict just by kicking her out? Thats a strange train of thought if ive ever seen one", "Wait im sorry\u2026 you didnt define hate. Probably because your idea of hate isn\u2019t based on its definition.", "no its just an objective fact. Has nothing to do with personal opinion. Your pfp is a weird pony, post physique or gtfo", "You\u2019re doing an awful lot of projecting here. Nothing suggests her relationship with her family is ruined lmao, and no functional and reasonable adult would let a scene at a church service ruin their relationship with their child. \n\nIt was clearly a victory for her. She no longer has to go to church against her will. She no longer has to be subjected to a religion she isn\u2019t into.", "Wow, your kids really don\u2019t talk to you anymore eh. Can\u2019t blame them honestly", "You\u2019re the one that brought up homeless drug addicts unprompted \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Funny way to say, \u201cI\u2019m wrong and know it, but I\u2019m being stubborn, so I\u2019ll just argue semantics.\u201d \nGG.", "Not really. Indifference isn't a sign of hatred, it's a neutral state. Whereas intolerance is a specific rejection of something, it has a drive behind it. What else would drive conscious intolerance?\n\nI can see why you'd think cartoon ponies are weird, they're open and colourful and full of love.", "Lol it\u2019s funny how this person devolved from \u201call my charity work\u201d to \u201cshe\u2019s a little screecher and is lucky her parents don\u2019t let her die a homeless adict!\u201d Really fast, but sure, keep telling us how magnanimous you are", "its not useless semantics it\u2019s important to the argument. You\u2019re describing evangelization as hate and I don\u2019t see the connection you think you\u2019re making. If you would stop being a sophist and answer instead of attacking me and then trying to run away i\u2019m sure you would see that you are the one whos wrong and it knows it.", "Not to mention this \"charity\" work is in the name of their church or religion and is pretty much always used to convert people or push their religion. No respect for people that need to do good stuff under the banner of their religion rather than just because it's the right thing to do."]}
