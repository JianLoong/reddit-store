I\u2019m ftm (female to male) transgender and have not medically transitioned in any way. But socially I have. But anyways I decided to wear a nice pair of brown pants with a white button down, collared shirt and a brown tie to match the pants. I didn\u2019t think the white shirt was an issue because my father and one of my brothers were also wearing the same white shirt that I was. And when we got to the wedding, so we\u2019re many of the other men there. But when my cousin, the bride, saw me she was super angry. She told me I had to change my shirt, put something over it, or leave. I went back to the car and put on my jacket but ended up having to take it off because her wedding was held in Arizona where it\u2019s still pretty warm out. She noticed I took off the jacket and came up to me angry again saying how I was \u201ctaking her special day away from her.\u201d But she hadn\u2019t asked any of the other men to change or cover up their white shirts and so I pointed her out on it and she got even angrier and had called for the venue\u2019s security to escort me out. I hate to throw the word transphobic around but I almost do feel like she was being a big transphobic because she specifically only asked me, the only trans man there, to change or cover my white shirt. She didn\u2019t ask any other man wearing a white shirt.

A. Shirt. It is literally not that deep. If a white button down is enough to \"take her special day away from her\" then her wedding sounds like a terrible time.", "The big no-no for anyone who is not the bride is wearing a white *dress.* You were not wearing a dress. NTA, and frankly if you hadn't been wearing a white shirt, she would have tried to find another way to kick you out because this is clearly transphobia.", "NTA. I hope her memories of that day are forever ruined. She did it all to herself.", "Even if you were dressed in feminine attire, wearing a white blouse with a dark skirt,  it wouldn't have been inappropriate. The prohibition on wearing white at a wedding is against wearing a *white (or other very pale pastel) dress or pantsuit* because that's viewed as an attempt to upstage the bride by wearing a wedding dress or formal pantsuit. A white blouse or shirt with dark pants or skirts in no way resembles bridal attire. \n\nNTA", "NTA. She is definitely transphobic. Even in traditionally male style dress, she still saw you as a woman wearing white at her wedding. \ud83d\ude44 I imagine she scapegoated you, funneling all her wedding day anxieties on to you. What a B and what a terrible time to experience with family, being embarrassed like that. Where were you family members during this and why didn\u2019t they intervene?", "NTA- A white shirt with nice slacks is basic wedding attire for men. Many of the men at my wedding were wearing white shirts. It was a July wedding and the AC at the venue was not powerful enough to keep the men from removing their jackets at the reception. \n\nIt sounds like the bride just wanted to be hateful.", "NTA. The rule about white is specifically about not upstaging the bride, so don't wear anything that could possibly read as bridal. As more weddings become less traditionally formal, this has extended to not wearing any kind of white dress or all-white jump or pantsuit. \n\nThere has never been a ban on white button down shirts for either gender, especially not when paired with non-white pants and/or neckwear.\n\nYour cousin is bigoted. Pure and simple. Block, ignore, and move on.", "NTA. And on the chance your gift to her was a check, call the bank and cancel it.", "NTA. \n\nFor fucks sake, even if you *weren't* a dude and were 110% female... It's a dress shirt! 99% of them are white. It's not a white dress, it's not an all white outfit, it's not trying to be a thing. Your cousin is nuts. \n\n-signed, a woman who can't really remember what any guests wore to her own wedding, and who owns several white dress shirts", "Apparently she mistook your outfit shirt for a shirtdress with long leggings and a tie. I see the confusion. /s\n\nNTA obviously. \n\nThe only attention that was grabbed was her crappy/transphobic manners grabbing attention from decent manners.", "NTA - that is terrible behaviour and almost certainly transphobia.\n\nAND ALSO - who is mistaking someone a brown suit for the bride? Especially a man?!", "NTA. If it\u2019s come to demanding that guys can\u2019t wear white dress shirts, I don\u2019t know what is happening anymore. And because you were literally wearing the same as other people there, it was clearly about YOU wearing a white shirt.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s because you\u2019re trans, and maybe it\u2019s because of some other vendetta, but from this it seems clear that her problem was with you specifically and not about what you were wearing.", "INFO: was your white shirt see-through in any way? Cause if you haven\u2019t medically transitioned and you weren\u2019t wearing anything that covered your chest like an undershirt, a bra or a binder, a see through shirt could draw people\u2019s attention away from her \u201cspecial day\u201d in a different sort of way, and it could also explain why she was fine with you just putting a jacket on. \n\nNo matter what, NTA, but I\u2019m curious to know if this could be the case?", "NTA- The brides an asshole and a bigot. I get that it's her day but that's not an excuse to be transphobic. She's an awful human being.", "This was just posted days ago", "INFO: Was it after Labor Day?", "the fact she got angrier after being confronted with the fact she singled you, the only trans person there, out tells you all you need to know. don't bother maintaining a relationship with her or anyone who stands by/justifies her behavior. i'm sorry to say it but deep down she doesn't view you as a \"\"real man\"\" and that's why she acted that way. from one trans man to another, you're absolutely NTA and to hell with transphobes.", "Nta. I never understood how someone's \"special day\" turned into an excuse to be a transphobic AH", "Your nice white shirt was clearly nicer than her tacky dress so own it.", "ESH - I don\u2019t think it\u2019s transphobia to be honest. If you haven\u2019t medically transitioned in any way, as you said, then despite the fact that you identify as male, you appeared at the wedding as a female, and it\u2019s a major fashion faux pas to wear white to a wedding. I completely agree that  you are in the same position as the other men and I don\u2019t mean to undermine your masculinity, however, simply put, if you physically appear female, I can see where the bride is coming from.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I swear this is an insane reaction to anything. Maybe if you wore completely white (shirt, pants, shoes, jacket, and tie) there might be something there but a white shirt is very common at weddings as they tend to be a good safe formal option for guys.", "haha wtf?  NTA, I've rarely seen any dressed up men not wearing white shirts unless it was casual dress shirt situation, and weddings rarely are that.  \n\n\nI am very sorry, that definitely sounds like she had a problem with you and dealt with it by being indirectly horrible and transphobic.  Maybe as your haven't physically transitioned your \\*non flat\\* chest mentally translates to her that you are still seen by her as a woman who is dressed in bridal colors of WHITE and she can't wrap her head around how that's not what was happening, you were dressed like all other male attendees, and weren't trying to show up the bride in some fancy white near wedding dress.   I'm sorry she was so uncomfortable with things for whatever reasons that she had to make a scene.", "NTA. She is showing that she doesn't view or respect you as a man. I'm so sorry. She's TA all fucking day.", "Any man who lives in Arizona needs a good lightweight jacket, to wear on occasions that are on the dressy side, and which are held in Arizona. \n\nYour sister was being completely irrational, and I hope it was just the wedding stress and not bigotry.  But do look for a good, lightweight, linen jacket, that's something you'll be able to wear for years.", "It\u2019s definitely fishy. Why wouldn\u2019t she tell the others? It just sounds like she only targeted you out rather than the others. Cause if wearing white was the problem. She would\u2019ve talked to the others.", "Well, at first I wanted to say \"don't wear white to a wedding\" but if other men were and that was fine... then I dont think you were the asshole.", " NTA I wear white shirts to many weddings", "??? This is pretty clear-cut transphobia NTA", "Brides are very opinionated on what they want at their wedding and storm about everything.", "Your cousin is TA", "What did your family say or do about it?", "NTA, obviously. Just wanted to say sorry you were singled out from other men like that.", "But it\u2019s MY DAY and it\u2019s not a wedding without micromanaging the guests!! Lol nta", "Maybe you, still with a woman\u2019s body, looked better in that white shirt/pants than she did in her gown and she is that insecure?", "A NTA and B she had you escorted out? Friend, family, or foe she\u2019s got to go\u2026 indefinitely", "NTA\n\nPart of me struggles to believe this is real because I can't imagine a person being so aggressive over this? Super weird behavior. I don't think you did anything wrong, personally. I do wish I could hear her side of the story because I'm curious, but she just didn't say it.", "Absolutely NTA, she\u2019s just transphobic...", "If a man can wear a white shirt and they normally take off their jackets during receptions to be comfortable then there is no reason why an FTM or a woman can't wear a white shirt as well with a skirt or slacks. The only thing not sold white should be the dresses / gowns.  Seriously it is too much now.", "She\u2019s the one who ruined her wedding\u2026not OP.  Yelling and calling security is what caused a scene.  I\u2019m sure no one else even noticed.   This wearing white thing has become bonkers and ridiculous.  Even if OP had been a woman in a white shirt and dark pants it shouldn\u2019t  have been an issue.", "Yeeez how mad has the world gone now?\n\nAgreed. Some people are just coco especially some brides.", "I would say no white pantsuits either as some brides wear those, but pretty much just no white traditionally \"feminine\" type clothing.\n\nThat all aside, as OP is a man and wore traditionally male clothing, I am right there with you. This was absolutely transphobic. Most men in western weddings tend to wear white shirts. OP was dressed pretty much like one would expect, and did nothing wrong.", "This is exactly what I\u2019m wondering\u2026 If there\u2019s been no physical transition yet and he\u2019s choosing to dress like a man does that mean no bra? A thin white shirt with no bra over a physically feminine pair of breasts would not be cool at a wedding. If he\u2019s bound up or very flat chested then obviously ok. But I can\u2019t help but think that wasn\u2019t the case."]}
