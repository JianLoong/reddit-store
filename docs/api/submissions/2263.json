Whatever amount of that vibe leaks into real life, she has to try to quash.", "This is a totally separate thing, but I do find it a little sad that connecting on STEM topics seems *so* important when it comes to your nephew and niece. That\u2019s your passion but it\u2019s not Miley\u2019s! Connecting with Miley would be about her interests, not your desire to recruit more girls into STEM. Many of the non-STEM women I know struggle with being treated as \u201clesser\u201d for not joining the STEM track.\n\nOn the second point: I of course only have a short Reddit post to go off of, so I can\u2019t know. Maybe Miley really is a spoiled golden child who cares only about the ipad, in which case, keep on keeping on! \n\nBut giving Miley the benefit of the doubt, I could imagine she is sad you called Noah your \u201cfavorite nephew\u201d because she can tell how much affection you have for him in that funny \u201cjoke\u201d. And \u201cfavorite\u201d just brings up feelings of comparison.

If Miley has ever sensed that OP prefers Noah, she might not be able to perfectly express *why* it feels unfair. But she\u2019s going to instinctively feel the difference between the way OP treats Noah and herself. \n\nAnd the way OP describes Miley in this post, I can\u2019t help but get the sense she thinks less of Miley than Noah. It\u2019s not, \u201cMiley is a wonderful, interesting kid, I just don\u2019t know what to talk about with her, because we have very different hobbies!\u201d \n\nRather, I hear, \u201cI don\u2019t really care to hang out with her\u201d and \u201cNoah got into an Ivy and I\u2019m SO proud of him.

You've put the same amount of effort into *trying to* bond with both, and Noah has very obviously returned that effort much more than Miley has.

Only Noah is OP's nephew. Miley is her niece.", "It\u2019s an abbreviation for Science Tech Engineering and Math.

It is not like you are saying You don't like your nice or have no relationship with her, every single relationship is different.", "NTA and I don\u2019t understand the people saying your the AH because you don\u2019t try to spend more time with Miley or stuff like that. She has tried but Miley isn\u2019t interested there isn\u2019t much more to it. She also has contributed large amounts of money to Miley 1500$ to give for a bday party is very very generous not many aunts/uncles would even consider doing that. Also, I would not expect my aunts or uncles to gift me extra things or expect large gifts if I don\u2019t do things with them or share interests compared to others but that\u2019s not even the problem, as OP is getting them equal gifts value wise. My sister for example babysits for my cousin and she is their favorite by far, but I have never done it for them as I wasn\u2019t available or lived close at the time and if they had tickets for a game or wanted to take her out for something special, I\u2019m not entitled to that as well I haven\u2019t built that relationship with them or put in nearly as much time", "Info: Have you tried bonding with Miley over any of her interests or just yours?", "Seems like the brother might not have told the daughter where some of the money came from", "And to add to this, Miley could ask op to do stuff with her too. Sometimes we just click better with different family members", "Have you ever tried to take any interest in her drawing? I don't mean buying her stuff for it. I mean actually engaging with her about stuff she likes.\n\nI don't think you did anything wrong by giving your nephew the gift, but based on your own words, you seem to write her off because she doesn't share your interests. It wouldn't surprise me if she has picked up on that and it makes her disinterested in spending time with you if she feels like it is a neverending sales pitch for your own interests and that she is somehow lesser for not liking the same things. Because it seems like you have no interest in engaging with her if it is not about stuff you like, and well, that's not a great way to foster a relationship with anyone because it conveys she has no value without an interest in STEM. You don't have to have a common interest with someone or throw money at them to engage someone about their hobbies.", "It's a two-way street.  Noah has really connected with OP, where Miley hasn't.  OP and Noah connect on a level that probably no other niece or nephew is going to connect.  Is it really about the money?  Or is it that OP is really a mentor to Noah, and that will never happen with Miley.", "NTA. Complainers gotta complain. Stupid stuff, and you explained the situation nicely.", "NTA.\n\nI can see (even if it makes no sense) how the niece is bitter but what's the matter with the brother lmao and you've not been unfair at all, you don't have to spend penny for penny on each relative. You seem like a great aunt to both of them.", "You're not the parent, you have no obligation to treat them equally. Unless you're deliberately ignoring your niece.\n\nI suspect a great reason they're complaining is because of the financial advantages they think Noah has over the sister for being the favorite. Again, they are not your kids, you're under no legal compulsion to treat them like parents treat them. Sure, it's great if you treat them equally, but the niece is not being mistreated. \n\nHowever, consider that Noah might suffer backlash from the sister and dad. \n\nNTA.", "This is so true.  It's a big deal when they are your own kids, but with an aunt or uncle it's really about who you connect with.", "He\u2019s the only nephew. He\u2019s the favorite and the least favorite nephew.\n\nIt\u2019s not that deep.", "So Miley has to go live with her as well?  Someone whose dream gift is a specific and costly eye shadow palette would be bored in my household in ten minutes. Miley and her dad have some nerve.", "Miley and her dad seem to think there is. I note Miley seems to be missing a mum, so maybe that's what this is all about.", "I'm a little at a loss as to WHY it is so important for OP to spend time with Miley if she doesn't find Miley, well, interesting. Aunt and uncles are not parents, and we can't be best friends with everyone. This insistence seems more than a little neurotic to me.", "It's not about the money. It's about the time, effort and attention.\n\nWhy does she deserve less time? What has she done to attract the opprobrium and derision of her aunt, other than  to have interests that are not sufficiently intellectual for her aunt? \n\nI'm an old geezer in my sixties but I would be happy to devote as much time as needed to whatever dull pastime or interest such a close loved one has in order to make them feel loved, wanted and cared for.\n\nOf course I'd be happier doing something that interested me but if a niece (or nephew) wanted to spend two hours looking at/for eye shadow, I would happily give of my time. It's the loving and human thing to do\n\nWhy do otherwise?", "Life is like that. Parents have to be---but often aren't---equal opportunity and even handed. When and how have these lines demanding equality from aunts and uncles been drawn?  That's not my life experience at all. And I think it's stupid and short-sighted to try to insist on it."]}
