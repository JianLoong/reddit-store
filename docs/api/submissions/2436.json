When we got back to the car I realized my 4 year old daughter was hiding something behind her back. It was a small chocolate. She stole it. I explained to her that what she was did was not right. She was stealing. I explained to her that she can get in a lot of trouble for stealing and that it was not acceptable. I told her that anything she gets from a store needs to paid paid for by mommy or daddy before leaving the store. She seemed pretty spooked, she never really knew the concept of stealing before this since my wife and I never brought it up. She seemed to feel really bad and I got that she understood that what she did shouldn\u2019t be done again. \n\nWe got into our car and waited for my wife. When she got to the car, I told her what happened. She told me that I should bring our daughter back into the store to pay for the chocolate as part of learning an important lesson. I said okay. \n\nWhen I got into the store with my daughter, there was a very long lineup to pay. So I had her put the chocolate back on the shelf and we went back to the car. I mentioned to the clerk that my daughter didn\u2019t pay for the chocolate and we were putting it back. The clerk didn\u2019t seem to care, and we left back to the car. \n\nWhen I got back to my wife and told her I just had our daughter put the chocolate back, she said that was unacceptable and we should have waited in line to pay for the chocolate. She said we are teaching our daughter a bad lesson and not paying for it. I said I disagreed, our daughter understood that what she did was wrong and we should just move on. My wife kept protesting but I said no, we\u2019re going home. And I turned on the car and drove away. \n\nMy wife is still mad, she says I\u2019m an asshole for undermining her and not teaching our daughter a lesson. I disagree and didn\u2019t think we needed to wait in line for so long over a 99 cent piece of chocolate. Our daughter felt really bad and I know she learned her lesson already.

If your daughter steal something, then you have to pay for it and get to keep it ? \n\nThe right thing was to go back and give it back. NTA", "NTA. Unless your daughter was going to be the one paying for it, I don't see how buying the chocolate was going to ensure somehow the lesson was learned.", "I disagree with your wife. In her scenario, the girl gets to keep the chocolate she stole. She's not the one paying for it, she just learns that if she steals, she gets to keep it. Putting it back rights the wrong better than keeping it, even if paid for.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "NTA. You would have been the one to pay for the chocolate, so the lesson would have been, \u201cif I steal something, my parent is gonna buy it for me when I get caught\u201d.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter is 4 for cripes sake. The concept of money is not developmentally appropriate yet. \n\nYour wife sounds a little harsh and a little too fixated on you punishing her. There could be a weird jealousy issue where you wife thinks you like the daughter more than her. \n\nThis is your wife's issue, but you may be part of the cause. Otherwise, this could grow into a more dramatic dynamic of 'daddy's girl' vs 'disciplinarian mommy'.\n\nYou and your wife need to get on the same page about discipline and be a united front.", "NTA\n\nThe grocery store was okay with you returning the item, and your daugther learned that she can't grab whatever thing she sees in the store without paying.", "The lesson was taught and from your daughters reaction, she probably did learn it.\n\nHowever you could have gone to the customer service desk and explained what happened to them and what you're trying to teach her. A good CS person would have helped drive it home, told her it was a good thing she came back and that all is forgiven.\n\nNTA", "NTA - You\u2019re both wrong. Your daughter stole. 4 years old is old enough to face full legal consequences for her actions.\n\nI think the store should have garnished her future wages based on the cost of the chocolate, inflation, and a reasonable 22% APR", "Nah. Different ways of dealing with an issue. Addressing it was the big deal and you did.", "NAH-Ok, yes, daughter goes back in, apologizes to cashier herself, the chocolate is paid for and then thrown away. The store cannot have items removed from the store and put back on the shelf for legal reasons. Daughter does not get the chocolate, learns lesson, store is compensated.", "Info\n\nIf she doesn\u2019t know the concept of stealing why was she hiding it behind her back?", "Are we disregarding the fact that the daughter hid it behind her back? That right there shows that she knew she did something wrong to begin with.", "You actually believe your daughter didn\u2019t know she was stealing and it\u2019s wrong? You said she was hiding it behind her back so she knew she was doing something wrong.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGiving it back was a fine solution. And: IF you wife thought a different solution would have been better, she could have gone in with your daughter herself.", "NTA, but you two better get aligned on parenting styles.", "NTA.\n\nYou dealt with it in real time and your kid seems to understand the lesson.   I'd have had her put it back too.  She's 4.  Getting a candy for as a reward for stealing doesn't really sit right with me.\n\nI'm not sure how you're undermining anything on your wife's side.  She's probably undermining you by arguing with you about it in front of the kid.", "I feel like I've missed an important part where the wife is suggesting they just pay and let the daughter keep the chocolate based on the comments here. \n\nIf my kid stole something I would absolutely make them pay for the item at the checkouts but they wouldn't get to take it home, it would be left there as part of the punishment/lesson. I wouldn't let them put it back on the shelf and sneak off like that absolved it all.", "NTA, the important thing is that she was caught, told about stealing, and put it back.\n\nWhen I was little, I remember doing almost the same thing. I wanted a whistle-pop, but knew my mom wouldn't buy it, so I just took one and kept it in my hand. As we left, my mom asked to hold my hand to walk out of the store, and she saw it. She was upset and made me go put it back. It hadn't occurred to me that stealing was a thing, just that I wanted it and knew my mom wouldn't agree.\n\nNever did that again, though.", "NTA your wife probably wanted to eat the chocolate. After all, in her mind, it would have been 'wrong' for your daughter to get a treat after she basically stole it and was caught.", "NTA and honestly I feel this is teaching the better lesson. Buying her something she tried to steal is just rewarding bad behavior.", "NTA, I think if anything she was undermining your parenting. Probably a better lesson to put it back anyways", "NTA \n\nIn your wife\u2019s version, your daughter still gets to keep the chocolate as if she did something worth getting chocolate for. Which she obviously did not. \n\nSecondly, you\u2019d be wasting everyone\u2019s time in the store, especially the cashier who honestly probably couldn\u2019t give a fuck less if you guys walked out with $100 worth of candy bars without paying.", "Expected this to go down differently. You should have immediately gone back into the store as soon as you realized she took the candy, I do agree with your wife there, but even if you didn\u2019t pay for it you did Inform the cashier and returned it to the shelf so no harm no foul. That is actually better because child does not deserve to get the candy after stealing, even accidentally. NTA", "NTA- You don't need to beat a dead horse to get the point across. And if she was THAT concerned about it, why didn't she just take your 4yo back in and humiliate her herself.", "NTA. What matters is your daughter grasping that items must be paid for before they're removed from the store. If putting the unpaid for item back teaches her that you can't just take them, then the result is as desired. There's no need to involve others in the situation. If she continues to do it, then yes, you need to increase the emphasis on why it's wrong. But for a first time offense, what you did was fine.", "NTA. You returned the chocolate and explained to her that it was wrong, and according to you, she felt extremely bad and learned her lesson. Having multiple consequences as a 4 year old seems a bit harsh. You had the conversation, brought her back to the store and made her put it back. She already was likely embarrassed enough based on that. Having her wait in line and pay for it seems like overkill for a 4 year old who did not understand the concept of stealing.", "NTA. The acceptable options were to pay or put it back.", "NTA - but I did something simliar at the same age. I don't remember what my parents said to me but I remember how I felt having to interact with the clerk when they brought me back...\n\nParents give many lectures/lessons in our lifetime and they tend to blend together, but I still recall the interaction with the clerk 40 years later.", "NTA. You returned the item, unpaid but unopened. The clerk did not care.", "You identified your daughter\u2019s theft, but made no attempt to rectify it with the store until your wife told you to. Then, once forced, you sneakily returned it to the shelf without an apology.\n\nYou\u2019ve now taught your daughter to:\n* hem and haw over doing the right thing\n* only do the right thing after you\u2019re caught\n* that *she* gets to decide what the okay consequences are not the person who was wronged\n* that apologizing to those she negatively affects is not necessary if it would further inconvenience her\n\nYTA", "NTA. If you had paid for it, who would have enjoyed the chocolates? Cuz I kiiiinda feel like teaching your kid that stealing is bad and making them go back in and pay might just end up with kids trying to pocket stuff randomly just to show you in the car so you'll go pay and they still get that thing lol. Like \"hey dad can you buy me this lollipop?\" \"not today\" *puts in pocket* *gets in car* \"hey dad I have this lollipop\" lol. Kids are very smart and catch on to this kinda thing. Obviously i doubt it would work everytime cuz eventually you'd see what they were doing but still. Putting it back is probably the better life lesson.", "NTA.  You tried to teach her it was wrong but your wife disagrees with your method \n\nHowever, i think you are mistaken that your daughter didnt know it was wrong.  She would not have hidden the candy behind her back unless she thought she was doing something wrong.\n\nI think if your daughter does this again, you can try your wife's method of teaching in her it is wrong, since if she does it again,  your method of teaching was ineffective, \n\nI also would not have stood in a long line to pay for it.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t buy my child something they stole or didn\u2019t ask me if they could have. I\u2019d also get the child to go back in and put it back and tell her maybe next time if you ask nicely we can buy the chocolate.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter stole something from a store. You and she returned it to its rightful place. \n\nI think she learned 2 lessons here: \n\n1. Not paying for something in the stores is stealing.\n\n2. Taking anything, without permission, is also stealing.", "Nta...BUT you did a disservice to your daughter by not having her confess to what she did in the store.....my brother's gf had a 5 finger discount policy she tried to pass on to her daughter.  When I learned this mess I actively put a stop to it....I know it ended when her dad took her out and found she had stolen some gum from a store(4 yrs old and her mom taught her how to move real fast back then). Let's just say how her dad handled the situation didn't make some stranger's happy but considering all the talks we had and explaining we did....he'd rather do jail time then allow his baby girl to steal....she's 7 now and hasn't ever found any more 5 finger discounts.", "NTA - there's a difference between undermining and having a disagreement about how to handle something that just came up.", "NTA both ways would teach her the lesson, now your daughter knows not to steal or at least to give back what you stole. As long as you addressed it and she understood that\u2019s what matters", "NTA. Paying for it wouldnt have made the lesson much more valuable. Your wife should have taken your daughter in herself if it was that important to her!", "NTA for the chocolate which is what you asked about.  \n\nI do think Y T A for you and your wife arguing about this in front of a 4 year old and probably making her feel worse. Then you just up and tell her what you are going to do.  You and your wife need to learn conflict resolution skills.", "NTA. She's 4 years old and you clearly explained to her what the lesson was and even returned the item and informed a member of the staff. I don't understand why your wife is blowing this out of proportion and if it's so important to her I guess she could return to the store and give them 99 cents even though you already returned the item it just seems like a really silly thing to blow up on your partner about when they've already addressed the issue. I'd say she needs to take a few deep breaths and move on I think you did a fine job as a father.", "I mean if that's how she's going to spin it then she is undermining you in front of your daughter as well.   \n\n\nYour way was acceptable. She hopefully learned her lesson, the candy has been returned. Had you paid then she got a treat as well so could be argued that that's not a great lesson as well.   \n\n\nNTA", "NAH, you will always have your disagreements being two different people raising children. You will each have your own way, she was undermining you more since you were the parent teaching her the lesson at the time.\n\nAlso, I think putting the candy back is a better lesson anyways. You do naughty things, you shouldn't get a treat for it. Plus, sounds like she understands the buying process already without buying the candy.\n\n(edit: oops forgot to add that I picked NAH because I do think that you should have taken your daughter back in immediately and not wait for your wife to tell you to. So, you both were a little wrong IMO).", "NTA. I did that once when I was very young, and my mom didn't discover it for a few blocks. She made me walk with her back to the store to put it back, which was bad enough for me, but the reason the lesson really stuck with me was that she told the clerk. Something about telling an 'authority figure' really drove the point home that I should never steal. It's been decades and I still remember being marched down the store aisle (and I've never stolen since).", "NTA. It sounds like your daughter learned her lesson before you even went back into the store, and you returned it without harm. No reason to drag out a punishment/lesson unnecessarily if the message already got through.", "NAH.  You cannot pay for something you don't know you have; your daughter hid the chocolate, so how could you know?\n\n In the best possible world, you would have easily brought your daughter and the chocolate to an older (hopefully experienced parent) cashier who could have talked to your daughter and expressed the importance of truthfulness and honesty (meaning, not stealing).\n\nOkay, that didn't happen - but you did bring the girl back and she replaced the chocolate in its original place.  I hope she took away the importance of not stealing.\n\nNot perfect, but not bad at all.", "NTA. Wouldn't it be a terrible lesson to buy the candy and let your daughter have it? That's kind of like telling her that even if she messes up someone will bail her out. I think your decision of putting it back and not giving her the chocolate was much better in terms of a \"lesson\".", "NAH? Overall I agree with your wife. You should wait to buy the chocolate, but then instead of feeding it to your daughter give it to the food donation bin. And then have her do chores to pay it off. I think that would have shown the message best. So I think your wife's solution overall was better but that more importantly as a couple you need to work together in these situations. Come to a solution and stick to it as to not undermine each other. Ideally you would have waited in line and called her to ask if you want to return the chocolate instead and teach your daughter the lesson some other way.\n\nSo i say NAH because I think neither of you were \"assholes\" but that you could still apologize for inadvertently undermining your wife and then you two can have a discussion about how to be thoughtful and make decisions together next time.", "YTA. But aside from the whole fact that the store cannot legally sell food items that has left the store, your daughter 100% knew she was stealing. \n\nShe Hid the item. If she didn\u2019t know she\u2019d done wrong then she\u2019d have zero reason to hide it.", "YTA. You said it yourself, you should not take something from a store without paying because that is stealing. You changed the rules because you were inconvenienced by a long line.\n\nEven though the chocolate was put back, you should have kept to the plan you agreed upon and set the example.", "NTA.  What you did was fine, you talked to your kid, let her know what she did wasnt acceptable,  and made her put it back, waiting a long time in line is just a waste of time.  Wife is making a bigger deal of this than it needs to be", "You don\u2019t wait in the check-out, you go to customer service and explain the situation, then pay for it.", "NTA, if she felt so strongly about her specific approach, she should've walked her back in. Putting it back is also a fine lesson", "NTA. If the goal is to teach your daughter a lesson in only taking what you pay for, you did just that. Sounds like you both had the same idea just went about it in a different way. (In fact your way is probably even more impactful because she\u2019s not getting the candy at all)\n\nI also think your wife should respect your decisions as a parent. Undermining \u201cher authority\u201d? Yikes. Does she not view you as an equal parent?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Not as bad when it's a small piece of candy, but what if she gets caught, especially when its something bigger?", "This is pretty much exactly what my wife said", "What? They mean after they found out. Not a difficult concept lol", "Thank you! Didn\u2019t want to make a big deal out of it.", "That\u2019s where the lineup was lol", "Cause clearly they're the Trunchbull.", "I got that reference!", "You're not wrong, but I would just be scared it would encourage the kid to continue stealing because she ends up getting the thing she steals.", "Along the same lines, isn\u2019t it back also showing her correct behavior????", ".... why would you pay for something you're not keeping?", "A thought to consider: you think your daughter didn\u2019t understand that her behavior was wrong. However, she was hiding it from you, so she knew she had done something to conceal. She is less innocent than you think.", "Buying it would have required \"admitting fault\" to the store. Putting it back was as sneaky as taking it.", "Please see my point about the person who is wronged deciding what is right.\n\nYes, a candy bar that\u2019s not opened and not smushed could *probably* be sold as new, but OP and his daughter are not in a position to make that assertion. Product/food safety laws vary wildly and only someone from the store can make that assessment.\n\nIt\u2019s not about waiting in line to pay, it\u2019s about waiting in line to bring the theft to the clerk\u2019s attention and having them inspect the merchandise and decide what to do. That might include a further wait for a manager.\n\nDad skipped the line because it was inconvenient to do the right thing. She was watching.", "The problem here is that they went back to the store with the intention of paying for a stolen item, but when they saw the big line father decided to give it back. So the lesson here is: let's rectify your mistake only of it is not an inconvenience.", "Your wife and a redditor can both be wrong. NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't sneak the item back in. Both your daughter and the clerk saw you tell the clerk what happened and they both saw you put it back. That taught your daughter that if she steals something, there is no way she'll get to keep it. Buying it for your daughter would have taught her that if she steals something, she'll get to keep it, if somebody else buys it for her.\n\nYou did the right thing, OP.", "Well, hopefully now you\u2019ll understand that you have to be the best role model you can be if you want her to turn out right. She\u2019s old enough to speak, but she\u2019s not old enough to reason. Showing means a lot more than saying.", "Yes and they brought their daughter back to replace the stolen item", "Yeah, then I would\u2019ve waited.", "Because MOST places, any food that has left the building can NO longer be resold so it would have to be wasted and the store would loose money", "The idea is you pay for the item and then TAKE it away from the child. Then telling them they don't get to hurt the store but they also aren't getting candy because of the bad decision they made.", "But he told the clerk that his daughter stole it and he brought it back.\nLike how did he sneakily bring it back into the store", "Not true for sealed food, you silly little goose", "I\u2019ve worked in the food industry for multiple years and I can tell you in at least my country that\u2019s not the case. ANY consumable food once left the premises if returned is trashed.", "even sealed stuff can be tampered with, candy bars like Hershey's are easy to open and re-close", "Ok, then why is OP to blame for that and not the store clerk for not caring? You work in the food industry so you know; why is OP as a civilian\u2019s responsibility to know this and not the store\u2019s workers to say \u201chey you actually can\u2019t put that back, pay for it?\u201d", "If it\u2019s still wrapped and sealed, it isn\u2019t consumable", "Why in the world are you being downvoted? This is correct.", "in most countries those will be returned to the shelf if still closed.", "It\u2019s not because you can\u2019t know for sure it\u2019s not been tampered with"]}
