He asked if I was hungry, and truthfully I was, so I said yes, but I'm too tired to cook.\n\nMy son offered to make me something to eat. I thanked him and told him to ask my husband to watch him in the kitchen, because he's too young to use kitchen appliances on his own. He came back with my stepson (13) saying that my husband was busy and asked if his stepbrother could supervise him instead. I said okay. My stepson asked if I was sick, and I said I was just rundown but would be okay.\n\nThey made me some veggies and rice (I'm unsure how much each kid did), and I thought all was well.  I felt much better after eating and was able to clean the kitchen. That night my husband asked me why I asked his son to make me something to eat. I said I didn't, he was just watching my son. My husband said my stepson ended up doing almost everything for him, because he was worried he would get hurt, and my stepson was in the middle of a school assignment when my son interrupted him.\n\nI said I didn't know that he was busy. He didn't tell me that. He didn't have to help my son when he asked. My husband said my son told my stepson I was sick, and that's why he stopped his assignments, and then he didn't want to be rude. I ended up snapping at him that maybe he should have come out to check on me himself when my son went to ask him for help.\n\nHe said that has nothing to do with the situation and \"my kid isn't your servant.\" I was so pissed and told him to fuck off and not talk to me the rest of the weekend. I made pancakes for breakfast (my husband hates pancakes) for myself and the boys, but he just made himself an omelet and didn't say anything. The thing is, my stepson must have said something to him or he wouldn't have even known they cooked for me. So my stepson must honestly feel wronged.\n\nAm I crazy?

Or, well - you made an error, but being wrong does not make you an AH. It means you made a mistake, and should learn from it.\n\nYour stepson is trying to be kind, respectful and considerate to you. That's why he dropped what he was doing to help. But part of being a parent is making sure that when you throw additional responsibilities onto them last minute, you are considerate of how they impacts what they are doing, and you didn't do that. Regardless of being pregnant, you're still the mom/stepmom, so that's still your failure because you're still the one with the authority and command. That becomes more and more important to do and be actively considering as the kids get older; easy enough to just assume at 7 (because 7yo's have pretty simple lives mostly dictated by mom anyway), but absolutely necessary to make sure to talk about and check at 13.\n\nLike; you're the boss of the house. Imagine if your work boss comes to you at noon and says \"I need you to write this report by the end of the day, I need to present it to the committee and board at 6 this evening\".       \nThat's sure something you're able to do. That's sure something the boss is allowed to *tell* you to do. It doesn't mean its not inconvenient, and it means that you're going to have to take a shorter lunch and cancel the coffee-break catch-up you'd had planned since a week ago, and it means the work you were going to do today needs to be squeezed into tomorrow's workday even though tomorrow was packed. And when the boss then doesn't thank you for stepping up and being willing to go above-and-beyond, you start to feel pretty crummy about it.\n\nThat's why the boss needs to make sure if they're asking you to do something, they actively consider how it impacts the person they ask. That its important and doesn't interrupt whatever else needs to get done same day too much. That's what it seems like didn't happen here this time.\n\nAnd if that's what your husband has a concern over, and wants to make sure is done next time - that's a very fair thing for him to raise. Beyond that, it seems like a conversation where both parties came out of the gate defensive and so wasn't as conductive as it should have been.", "ESH-not crazy and not wrong. I wouldn\u2019t bring it up again, but I would also not be passive aggressively making pancakes for breakfast knowing your husband doesn\u2019t like them. \n\nYou and hubby both need to apologize for your behavior. You for the pancakes. Him for saying you treat his son like a servant. \n\nMy vote would have been NTA if it hadn\u2019t been for the pancakes situation.

Then, remind him that it\u2019s okay to tell him when he\u2019s busy (\u201cI won\u2019t be mad if you\u2019re too busy with things like schoolwork, your schooling comes first, and I will be happy you can be honest with me!\u201d)\n\nAs for your husband\u2026 dunno, maybe he should read some of these comments about him. Sounds like he has some lessons in kindness to learn from your stepson!", "I think you maybe you should talk to your stepson and cut out the middleman.  Tell him that you really appreciate what he did, but you didn't intend to pull him away from his studies and you're sorry.  Let him know that if it happens again, to check with you and let you know if he's really busy with something and it will be fully okay if he can't help out.  Reiterate that you appreciate what he did, but you don't want to cause him to miss any important work or lose focus. \n\nYou're NTA. You didn't know what was going on.  Your husband is an AH for so very many reasons.   I don't know how you can have a calm conversation with him about this when he doesn't appear to be listening to you and is definitely drawing familial lines in the sand with yours, mine and ours kid wise.   That's a problem.  \n\nGood luck.", "NTA but stepson should\u2019ve communicated he was busy.  But I get stepson is still young and maybe you will be more aware that it\u2019s hard for stepson to be frank with you. \n\nYour Hubby went way overboard, \u201cservant\u201d?  Damn", "You\u2019re having a baby with a man who says HIS kid isn\u2019t your servant when you\u2019re very pregnant and exhausted and your son asked for help? Your husband wouldn\u2019t lift a finger and just blamed you? Wtf. NTA", "You're only mistake is having a baby with your husband. The man is phlegm.", "NTA- your stepson lives with you, and you usually make the meals?? Your husband is a big AH for even suggesting that you are treating his son as a servant.\nStepson sounds like a good kid. I sure wouldn\u2019t worry about what your stepson said. It could be that he just mentioned it, because it was a good thing he did. Or maybe AH why he was still working on his homework, or where he was. Just because he mentioned it doesn\u2019t mean in a bad way.", "Info; how did it come up that your stepson had an assignment and your husband was upset ? \n\nHe wasn't there to begin with so he had no idea what was going on right ?", "YTA your stepson sounds like a good kid and you took advantage. He had schoolwork. And the way you responded to your husband makes you a HUGE asshole. Being pregnant is not an excuse.", "Op is NTA!! But I would pull the step son aside and say how much u appreciate him doing that for you x", "Sorry you have the spawn ofa selfish sick in you", "NTA\n\nI don't think your stepson felt wronged. He could have just been relaying his morning to his dad. A 7yo also doesn't have the right vocabulary for what you were going through so \"Mom feels sick\" seems appropriate as a reason from him.", "NTA and this whole \u201cmy son your son\u201d is not going to make a blended family function. Not at all. And from the info you have given, I would say it\u2019s definitely on the husbands shoulders", "Tired because 37 weeks pregnant is equal to sick. It\u2019s not sick, because pregnancy is not an illness. But it is the same as sick, because it\u2019s a huge impact on the body, the likes of which most men will not experience until old age or actual illness hits them. Why wouldn\u2019t it be seen as exactly the same? \n\n\u201cOne of my internal organs is filled with a growth that weighs 8lb. The growth is also affecting my bio-regulators and caused all my muscles and ligaments to loosen, so all my physical activity like standing and walking is more difficult and painful. I\u2019ve been at work all day and, given all of those massive, negative, physiological changes I don\u2019t feel well enough to cook dinner.\u201d That\u2019s \u2018sick\u2019, right??? There are cancers that are less painful and debilitating, for fucks sake. If that description was a cancer, everyone would have far more empathy\u2026 but why, if the lived experience is the same?\n\nWhy is this man criticising his partner for feeling like shit and needing help when she is growing his offspring? Why is he not the one helping her?\n\nWhere the fuck are people getting these garbage bin men from?", "Uiiii ly", "While I agree with you the first sentence irks me the f out. You are at least two people when having sex. And unless it is rape you are equally responsible for the outcome. Also further more a woman\u2019s body a woman\u2019s choice. Making the man responsible for the pregnancy sounds like we are living in the 1950s.", "Yeah, we cook together all the time. I just don't let him do it by himself yet. He has the skills, but I don't want him alone with knives and burners.", "This - but it\u2019s not just 8 pounds of baby there\u2019s also amniotic fluid and placenta.", "Your stepson is a credit to his mother and you. It\u2019s unfortunate that his Dad is such an arsehole but hopefully the women in his life will be able to raise him to be a better man.", "oh yes\nlet\u2019s focus on that and not that the woman this man is having a baby with was tired and hungry.", "\u201cDramatically waiting\u201d you\u2019re ridiculous. She was existing in a private place (her couch, in her house), and expressed her physical pain to another person who happened to come along and ask. That person saw her and had a genuine, human, compassionate response to assist her. That person is 7, so did the best help he could and got his parent, who also happens to be this woman\u2019s life partner.\n\nThat man was cruel to her, and left her to suffer. He let his two little boys be better people than him and support her, then berated her for it when she is pregnant with his child. Why wouldn\u2019t he just cook dinner? What\u2019s wrong with him? What could be more important than feeding his pregnant wife and his own children?\n\nIf you think she\u2019s the A here then I hope no other human has, or will ever have, the misfortune of hitching their wagon to your cart. Clearly you are not well-built for interpersonal relationships.", "Or maybe she was just lying down and her son had happened to ask as is what happens in most loving families. Sorry you clearly have not experienced that. I didn\u2019t get to either but I\u2019ve seen it up close enough that I still understand what it is and don\u2019t project my issues onto others.", "I guess you do you. I went more along the route of just not cooking period, because I was just too sick/tired. Regardless, I hope he shapes up soon.", "Oh believe me I know - me, my shitty pelvic girdle, and the crutches I bowled about on for the last 6+2=bloody 8 weeks of my pregnancy! \n\nI was going for a tumour metaphor, for the bottom-dwellers who seem to think growing a human is broadly equivalent to forming a large poo.", "All I can picture is Tiffany Pollard aka New York waiting on the bed with her sunglasses on and her lips pursed \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "I understand. And I\u2019m sure my initial response is not a good one but the guy was mad essentially because his teen son did what he should have done for his pregnant wife, and that\u2019s quite unfortunate.", "Agree", "My guess is dad is ashamed that his sons(?) stepped up and he did not  ... at least, I hope he is..."]}
