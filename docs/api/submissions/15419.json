He asked if I was hungry, and truthfully I was, so I said yes, but I'm too tired to cook.\n\nMy son offered to make me something to eat. I thanked him and told him to ask my husband to watch him in the kitchen, because he's too young to use kitchen appliances on his own. He came back with my stepson (13) saying that my husband was busy and asked if his stepbrother could supervise him instead. I said okay. My stepson asked if I was sick, and I said I was just rundown but would be okay.\n\nThey made me some veggies and rice (I'm unsure how much each kid did), and I thought all was well.  I felt much better after eating and was able to clean the kitchen. That night my husband asked me why I asked his son to make me something to eat. I said I didn't, he was just watching my son. My husband said my stepson ended up doing almost everything for him, because he was worried he would get hurt, and my stepson was in the middle of a school assignment when my son interrupted him.\n\nI said I didn't know that he was busy. He didn't tell me that. He didn't have to help my son when he asked. My husband said my son told my stepson I was sick, and that's why he stopped his assignments, and then he didn't want to be rude. I ended up snapping at him that maybe he should have come out to check on me himself when my son went to ask him for help.\n\nHe said that has nothing to do with the situation and \"my kid isn't your servant.\" I was so pissed and told him to fuck off and not talk to me the rest of the weekend. I made pancakes for breakfast (my husband hates pancakes) for myself and the boys, but he just made himself an omelet and didn't say anything. The thing is, my stepson must have said something to him or he wouldn't have even known they cooked for me. So my stepson must honestly feel wronged.\n\nAm I crazy?

Everyone has a responsibility. One time or rare occurrence of cooking isn\u2019t a problem.\n\nNow if you had him cook everyday that would be an issue.

Or, well - you made an error, but being wrong does not make you an AH. It means you made a mistake, and should learn from it.\n\nYour stepson is trying to be kind, respectful and considerate to you. That's why he dropped what he was doing to help. But part of being a parent is making sure that when you throw additional responsibilities onto them last minute, you are considerate of how they impacts what they are doing, and you didn't do that. Regardless of being pregnant, you're still the mom/stepmom, so that's still your failure because you're still the one with the authority and command. That becomes more and more important to do and be actively considering as the kids get older; easy enough to just assume at 7 (because 7yo's have pretty simple lives mostly dictated by mom anyway), but absolutely necessary to make sure to talk about and check at 13.\n\nLike; you're the boss of the house. Imagine if your work boss comes to you at noon and says \"I need you to write this report by the end of the day, I need to present it to the committee and board at 6 this evening\".       \nThat's sure something you're able to do. That's sure something the boss is allowed to *tell* you to do. It doesn't mean its not inconvenient, and it means that you're going to have to take a shorter lunch and cancel the coffee-break catch-up you'd had planned since a week ago, and it means the work you were going to do today needs to be squeezed into tomorrow's workday even though tomorrow was packed. And when the boss then doesn't thank you for stepping up and being willing to go above-and-beyond, you start to feel pretty crummy about it.\n\nThat's why the boss needs to make sure if they're asking you to do something, they actively consider how it impacts the person they ask. That its important and doesn't interrupt whatever else needs to get done same day too much. That's what it seems like didn't happen here this time.\n\nAnd if that's what your husband has a concern over, and wants to make sure is done next time - that's a very fair thing for him to raise. Beyond that, it seems like a conversation where both parties came out of the gate defensive and so wasn't as conductive as it should have been.", "ESH-not crazy and not wrong. I wouldn\u2019t bring it up again, but I would also not be passive aggressively making pancakes for breakfast knowing your husband doesn\u2019t like them. \n\nYou and hubby both need to apologize for your behavior. You for the pancakes. Him for saying you treat his son like a servant. \n\nMy vote would have been NTA if it hadn\u2019t been for the pancakes situation.

Are your really unsure what you should do?\n\n1. You have two wonderful young men who care about you and are willing to put themselves to trouble to help you feel better.\n2. You should take the time to tell them both how much you appreciated the way the cared for you that day.\n3. Your stepson also cares so much for his little stepbrother that he did a lot to make sure little SB was safe in the kitchen.\n4. You should give your SS an extra thank you for that and also tell him you understand he had a big assignment due at the time. Tell him you hope his work didn't suffer because he was helping out. Ask him to please let you know what he needs, so you can make sure he has the support he needs, too.\n5. If those were the only men in your life, I'd say you have a pretty great blended family. Unfortunately, your husband is part of the mix. He brings the notion of a happy family to a grinding halt.\n6. He is not a good husband: \"He said that has nothing to do with the situation.\" EXCUSE ME?!? Who exactly got you pregnant? Who committed to loving, caring about, and supporting you (I'm talking about in those intangible ways that life partners do.)? But he was too busy to see how you were doing or to care for you when you weren't well.\n7. He is neither a great dad or stepdad. He didn't care a bit about you or his stepson who was trying to take care of you. He has no interest in how all of you connect as a family. \"my kid isn't your servant.\" If you were treating your stepson as a servant, your husband could be applauded for protecting him; BUT that wasn't what was going on.\n\nMore likely, I'd say, your husband couldn't be bothered to care about anybody but himself. The two young men's actions showed what an a$$ he is, so now he wants to paint you as the bad guy that put his kid in a tough spot.\n\nI gotta' wonder what about your husband made you want to marry him.", "NTA - what a lovely 13 year old he clearly cares about you \ud83d\udc90", "Dad's pissed because he feels guilty that HE let his son and stepson cook for his pregnant wife. It was clearly his responsibility to not only check on her health,  but help her be healthy and nourished. He let this happen,  not you. NTA", "Im heartbroken this is the person op decided to procreate with\u2026. Poor woman. Prob a reason she had a step son, the other mother wised up and left the deadbeat.", "The husband is an AH imo for suggesting she is using his kid as a servant", ">Who lets a 13 year old cook? \n\nA 13 yo should absolutely be able to cook simple meals.", "My 3-year-old (under constant supervision) makes pasta, scrambled eggs, quesadillas, toaster waffles, guacamole\u2026 you get the point. \n\nJust because a lot of parents don\u2019t teach their kids to cook, doesn\u2019t mean kids aren\u2019t capable. \n\nOP did the exact right thing in making sure her son was being watched, but it\u2019s totally reasonable for a 7 year old to make rice and some veg.", "This is an extremely unhinged comment. Please seek therapy.", "I agree with everything about this comment except for the bit about pregnancy not being an illness. Pregnancy is the most dangerous physical condition most people with uteruses will ever go through. \u201cPregnancy is not an illness\u201d is the argument a bunch of anti-abortion doctors just made to an anti-abortion judge in an attempt to cut off access to medication abortion to millions of American women. If \u201can externally inflicted medical condition you can die of or be permanently disabled by\u201d is not an illness, I don\u2019t really know what is.\n\nNTA, though!", "I've got an early memory of my mom being sick, just like bad cold/flu. I was about old enough to see over the bed, and it made little me worry! Can't imagine it's much better at 7, and at 7 they really aren't going to understand pregnancy (other than the basics) so all they know is mom isn't feeling well and more worrying to them not acting/doing things like normal.", "dunno why your husband is so butthurt his son did a nice thing for somebody else. especially considering he\u2019s the one who failed to be there in the first place. the kid deserves praise after that, not an argument and a tense atmosphere. that\u2019ll just teach him not to do it again. op, please make sure he knows what he did was a really kind thing to do!", "Guess we found hubby's account, lol.", "\u2026How would he be handling every meal if he was working full time without a wife? How were you able to work full time while pregnant and handling the meals?\n\nMen are no less capable than women when it comes to being able to feed their families.", "Would you have been ok with that or would you have made him feel guilty? Would your son also blame him? He might feel obligated to help and feel uncomfortable saying no. The burden is on the adults to solve the problem not these kids. You know your husband has a conference call but you still expect him to watch over your son? You and your husband should have better communication about the responsibilities around the house.", "Did you read the first five words?", "Of course, how could we forget the sighing and the fan?  lol", "NTA- just maybe ask if he was busy doing Hw. He may have said something because he was worried about you and not feeling wronged for helping. But make sure you tell the kids that your really appreciated them taking care of you because you coming to the end of you pregnancy you can get tired easier.", "You are doing an amazing job as a mother, step mother and wife. You\u2019re pregnant and still doing as much as you can while your husband does nothing to help when you need him. Keep the kids, ditch the husband. Congratulations on the new baby, I hope everything goes smoothly with the delivery. \n\nNTA", "JFC NTA but your husband sure is. Both your kids should be able to handle minor things in the kitchen and you are very pregnant and need some help. Your husband is lazy and terrible.", "Why are you with this jerk? The stepson is 13 asking to help you out is not out of line. Heck, 13 year old should be practicing life skills like cooking anyway. Your husband doesn\u2019t check on you and claim his son helping his pregnant step mom out is being a servant.\n\nI feel bad for you.", "Gotta love how he immediately deflected any responsibility and put it all back on her, making her feel like she used his son as a servant. Did he wipe his hands clean on your nightgown after that crap throw.", "NTA and I'm honestly confused as to whole division of my kid your kid. Like, step parents are parents. I don't know how long you two have been together, but your husband shouldn't be mad that your stepson helped you out. Makes me wonder if he'd be there for your son if anything happened or if he'd just be like,  \"Not my kid, where's OP?\"", "NTA. Husband is gaslighting you. \n\nShow stepson how appreciated he is. Son as well.", "Exactly. \n\nHave. A. Conversation. With. The. Stepson!!!!!\n\nSo difficult", "When I was pregnant (let\u2019s just say a few decades ago) it was classified as a disease. That\u2019s the military health system for you.  Actually I think it was classified as such into the 2000s in both military and civilian systems.", "Thank him for what he did -one extra time. NTA and kick your husband s ass for being a huge ah. Is your Mil a nice person? If so mention it to her how your husband couldn't be bothered to even check on you when you were unwell never mind making you something to eat and that he blew up at you that the kids prepared you meal (explainin what he said you were using his son as a servant) . I hope she rips him a new one", "I did? Try reading my comment again so you see what I\u2019m criticizing", "My guess is her stepson probably told his father he wouldn\u2019t have had to stop in the middle of his assignment to cook dinner if he had stepped up in the first place.", "no yeah i wasnt excusing him at all. I dont think he actually \"feels guilt\" in the normal sense either. More like implying he did something wrong leads to him being upset. He only actually feels the Upset part and chooses to take that out on whoever's easiest to abuse instead of, you know, thinking.", "when i say \"unconsciously guilty,\" it's more like, merely implying that he did something wrong is blasphemy, which includes finding a solution to a problem.\n\nAs an example, my own stepdad left the toaster on and filled the whole house up with smoke. He just turned the smoke detectors off and sat back down while I was running around the house opening up windows so I could breathe. He screamed at me to close all the windows even tho the house was still full of smoke and the weather was fine. I know my stepdad('s psyche) well enough to know that I hit some insecurity somehow by fucking opening up windows. The problem wasnt the smoke in the house, it was How He Felt and his one brain cell decided I was the cause of that (and not himself bc that would require reflection and discomfort). Feeling guilt by technicality in that implying he did something wrong makes him upset, and expressing that \"upset\" feeling in the stupidest way possible. I doubt he consciously processes that he feels insecure at all.\n\nA really weird mix of zero emotional intelligence and extreme sensitivity. He'll snap over literally any kind of perceived slight. Got jealous of the dog getting attention from my mom kinda guy. My own brother used to do this kinda shit and I've seen other people do it too, but for whatever reason especially older men.\n\nAgain, it's just a possibility and OP's story reminds me of my own experiences with insecure old men."]}
