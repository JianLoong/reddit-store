I am three weeks from my due date, but my maternity leave doesn't start for another week. I came come and sat down on the couch and didn't want to get up for any reason. My son (7) asked me to play with him, but I said I didn't have any energy. He asked if I was hungry, and truthfully I was, so I said yes, but I'm too tired to cook.\n\nMy son offered to make me something to eat. I thanked him and told him to ask my husband to watch him in the kitchen, because he's too young to use kitchen appliances on his own. He came back with my stepson (13) saying that my husband was busy and asked if his stepbrother could supervise him instead. I said okay. My stepson asked if I was sick, and I said I was just rundown but would be okay.\n\nThey made me some veggies and rice (I'm unsure how much each kid did), and I thought all was well.  I felt much better after eating and was able to clean the kitchen. That night my husband asked me why I asked his son to make me something to eat. I said I didn't, he was just watching my son. My husband said my stepson ended up doing almost everything for him, because he was worried he would get hurt, and my stepson was in the middle of a school assignment when my son interrupted him.\n\nI said I didn't know that he was busy. He didn't tell me that. He didn't have to help my son when he asked. My husband said my son told my stepson I was sick, and that's why he stopped his assignments, and then he didn't want to be rude. I ended up snapping at him that maybe he should have come out to check on me himself when my son went to ask him for help.\n\nHe said that has nothing to do with the situation and \"my kid isn't your servant.\" I was so pissed and told him to fuck off and not talk to me the rest of the weekend. I made pancakes for breakfast (my husband hates pancakes) for myself and the boys, but he just made himself an omelet and didn't say anything. The thing is, my stepson must have said something to him or he wouldn't have even known they cooked for me. So my stepson must honestly feel wronged.\n\nAm I crazy?

It sounds like your husband is the one that took that information and made a big deal out of it.", "NTA. Talk to your stepson, don't let the resentment build or the narrative be controlled by somebody else. Explain the situation and let him know he is okay to speak up if he's busy. Your husband is TA here, he should have stepped up, especially if your son was telling him you were sick.", "wait... didn't your son ask your husband first? \n\nNTA - Your stepson is sweet.", "NTA  Talk to your stepson. Tell him you're sorry your son interrupted his project and how much you appreciated what he did for you last night. Then,  tell him  in the future that if he's just too busy,  he should  know he can feel comfortable with saying \"no\" to your son when he makes a request like that. Or he should come talk to you,  since it wasn't your intent to interrupt him or have him prepare you food,  although you do appreciate what he did for you.", "NTA. Sounds like your husband is.", "NTA, and make all the pancakes you like. But make sure to thank your stepson. Your husband can make his own omelet.", "Your husband seems to be a major problem.  More than likely, he asked his son if he completed his assignment, and his son advised what happened. Your husband is the AH for not checking up on you. He comes off with red flags in my mind as I suspect that there are other situations like this.\n\nIn addition, you were lying down, so you had no way of knowing. \n\nNTA.", "No you\u2019re not crazy but your husband is. And an asshole too. Sweet merciful crap, you\u2019re about to give birth and your 7yo has more compassion AND common bloody sense than his grown-ass stepdad. Ffs your husband doesn\u2019t even have time to help the child who\u2019s doing the adult, caring, responsible thing?! You are definitely NTA, except possibly to yourself, for marrying this petty, small man", "Nta. His problem is his son helped out? Wtf? \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "NTA, just a misunderstanding/ miscommunication. I\u2019m sure that a quick chat with your stepson would clear it up and he would understand. Let him know you appreciate what he did for you and your son. \n\nYour husband on the other hand, he is TA.", "NTA, but have a talk with your stepson telling him you appreciate what he did. Your husband is the asshole here.", "NTA.  At this point in your pregnancy your husband should be on high alert for anything unusual and he should know this after having at least this one kid.  When the 7 year old asked him about cooking he should have taken 2 seconds to see what was up and then would have been more on top of the whole thing.  He needs to be more involved, and more empathetic.  You should both apologize to your stepson together, however.  It\u2019s important for the boys to know you 2 are a team and for your stepson to know you are thinking about him.", "NTA your stepson is a good kid and I agree merits some positive reinforcement from you to know he can use his advanced maturity to teach his own father, and your son is similarly a good kid for being that responsible in the face of wanting to make sure you eat. \n\nYour husband should have stepped up.", "NTA, but wow, It sounds like that game where you whisper  a word to one person, and they keep whispering to the next person,  untill it sounds nothing mine what you said. \n\nIf your husband is so concerned,  why didnt he get you something to eat. \n\nAlso, maybe talk to your stepson, letting him know you appreciate what he did, but also that if he was busy with school, he could've told you, in stead of doing it anyway and then talk to his dad afterwards.", "NAH\n\nThis is called a family. Everyone has a responsibility. One time or rare occurrence of cooking isn\u2019t a problem.\n\nNow if you had him cook everyday that would be an issue. Also, if your husband has something to say then where the heck was he?", "Info: did you actually ask you stepson if he was okay watching your son in the first place?", "Nta,but your husband is,your stepson on the other hand is an absolute sweetheart.", "NAH. Or, well - you made an error, but being wrong does not make you an AH. It means you made a mistake, and should learn from it.\n\nYour stepson is trying to be kind, respectful and considerate to you. That's why he dropped what he was doing to help. But part of being a parent is making sure that when you throw additional responsibilities onto them last minute, you are considerate of how they impacts what they are doing, and you didn't do that. Regardless of being pregnant, you're still the mom/stepmom, so that's still your failure because you're still the one with the authority and command. That becomes more and more important to do and be actively considering as the kids get older; easy enough to just assume at 7 (because 7yo's have pretty simple lives mostly dictated by mom anyway), but absolutely necessary to make sure to talk about and check at 13.\n\nLike; you're the boss of the house. Imagine if your work boss comes to you at noon and says \"I need you to write this report by the end of the day, I need to present it to the committee and board at 6 this evening\".       \nThat's sure something you're able to do. That's sure something the boss is allowed to *tell* you to do. It doesn't mean its not inconvenient, and it means that you're going to have to take a shorter lunch and cancel the coffee-break catch-up you'd had planned since a week ago, and it means the work you were going to do today needs to be squeezed into tomorrow's workday even though tomorrow was packed. And when the boss then doesn't thank you for stepping up and being willing to go above-and-beyond, you start to feel pretty crummy about it.\n\nThat's why the boss needs to make sure if they're asking you to do something, they actively consider how it impacts the person they ask. That its important and doesn't interrupt whatever else needs to get done same day too much. That's what it seems like didn't happen here this time.\n\nAnd if that's what your husband has a concern over, and wants to make sure is done next time - that's a very fair thing for him to raise. Beyond that, it seems like a conversation where both parties came out of the gate defensive and so wasn't as conductive as it should have been.", "ESH-not crazy and not wrong. I wouldn\u2019t bring it up again, but I would also not be passive aggressively making pancakes for breakfast knowing your husband doesn\u2019t like them. \n\nYou and hubby both need to apologize for your behavior. You for the pancakes. Him for saying you treat his son like a servant. \n\nMy vote would have been NTA if it hadn\u2019t been for the pancakes situation. That\u2019s the only place where YTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
