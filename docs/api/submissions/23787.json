That's too loud for a restaurant.\n\nYou're dining in a restaurant. You need to moderate your voices - the people at the next table don't want to hear your conversation, and they don't want to be continually disturbed by the happy shrieks of your baby either.\n\nYou're not the asshole for making your baby happy. You're the asshole for making too much noise in a restaurant.\n\nYTA", "YTA. Because when you were informed you were bothering other people (who were also paying to enjoy a nice dinner) your response was essentially \u201cfuck them.\u201d There\u2019s something to be said for basic manners.", "YTA. \n\nYou\u2019re one of those people lol", "YTA. Let me preface this by saying that there is nothing wrong with your child's joy and you sound like a fantastic parent. \n\nBUT in your post you mentioned both laughing and happy yelling. Those are not the same thing. A quiet giggle? Sure, no problem. But yelling? No. Just because it's happy, doesn't take away the fact that it's yelling. Imagine if you were just trying to enjoy a quiet dinner with your family and group of rowdy drunken people kept yelling and laughing at the table next to yours. Happy doesn't mean it's not still annoying.", "INFO: what were you doing to make him laugh?", "How can you not see that your screaming baby was preventing the other people in the restaurant from having a good time? No one wants to be around a baby that's being loud like yours was. \n\nYTA", "YTA. You deliberately provoked your kiddo into making loud noises in a place where people go to relax and enjoy conversation. There's nothing wrong with your kid laughing, but there's a time and a place for it. If you'd been doing this in a public park, that would be fine, but you were in a mid-tier restaurant, and you continued after people told you it was a problem. If you'd toned it down a notch after they asked, you would have been fine.", "YTA.    Yelling due to happiness or otherwise is not appropriate for ANY restaurant.    And you were doing it on purpose, even after someone asked you to knock it off.", "YTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Well at dinner I was making him laugh.  He'd throw in some happy yelling.  Maybe got a touch loud  \n>  \n>I'm like he's laughing thats all.\n\nBut laughing wasn't \"all.\" He was *yelling*. Loudly. Loudly enough to be annoying to other diners. And you kept on with it, instead of trying to quiet him down and keep him quietly happy.\n\nThere's a time and a place for loud happy yelling. A restaurant isn't it.", "YTA. Self awareness is a thing. To you it's the most beautiful sound in the world. To everyone else it's a shriek that gets louder and louder.", "I swear to god, parents lose all sense of how their children and themselves are perceived externally.\n\nIt doesn't matter whether the baby was screaming cause he's happy or he's sad. No one cares, really. Decibels are decibels. It was a distraction and sensory disturbance to other patrons in the restaurant. \n\nIt's one thing if you're somewhere you have to be, like in a doctor's waiting room. Dining out is a choice to passively socialize broadly and a certain social contract is in place.", "YTA. There is time and place for making your baby laugh and yell like that, and that wasn't it.", "YTA. \n\nYou love your kid and think he's adorable but other people were there to enjoy a meal. You were deliberately attention seeking and probably wanted everyone to notice your wonderful baby, and were willing to give a \"fuck you\" to other paying patrons when asked to tone it down.\n\nHow tiresome. \n\nHope you left a really big tip for the extra inconvenience you placed on the staff too - having to move customers to a new table and deal with the complaints.", "YTA, there is a difference between a baby crying in a restaurant on its own, and you encouraging your baby to be loud by laughing. Have some curtesy for other people when out in public. This is some entitled BS on your part.", "YTA the world doesn't revolve around you and your family. Will you be the parent that ignores their child's screaming out in public as well? Do that crap in your own home not out in public where, believe it or not, other people exist.", "YTA. Wanna be loud, go to a playground or maccies", "YTA - There's a time & place for everything. I could get if you tried to make the baby laugh if he was already screaming/crying, but you stated in another comment that you made him laugh out of the blue by tickling him. And then when the laughing was annoying the other eaters they asked you to stop. Had you stopped there then things probably would've been ok, but you continued the laughing anyway to just annoy everyone around you.", "Yta. I take my kids to restaurants all the time. I had to train them to do this. Babies- diners or family friendly restaurants only. If you want to try something not like that you have to be respectful of other people. Going early is always good and asking to be sit away from people is better. Getting your kid shrieking with laughter is why you are an asshole. Next time you guys do this Pick a family restaurant.", "YTA. You were imposing your kid on other people and when asked to quiet it, you doubled down.  I adore making babies laugh but I'm also an adult and cognizant of people around me.", "YTA. There is a time and a place for everything. \n\nIf you were sitting on an outdoor patio and someone at the next table starting playing tug of war with their dogs and getting them worked up and barking, would you complain about them because they are making happy noises? I don't think so!\n\nWhile it is great that you enjoy your children/pets, you don't get them worked up next to others who are trying to enjoy a quiet, pleasant meal.", "Yta- high pitched baby laughs can be equal to a jumbo jet.", "YTA. \n\nConstantly making your child laugh for the sake of laughing in a restaurant is rude. I personally would find it cute. For a bit.\n\nMy wife and I have had to get our dinners to go because of an inconsolable child. It\u2019s just what we deal with as parents. \n\nLet\u2019s play a game. You\u2019re out with your wife for a big anniversary. It\u2019s supposed to be a romantic night out with just the two of you. Once at the restaurant a group of 4 people get seated next to you. You find out that they are celebrating a windfall business deal because of how loud they are being. They cheer, and toast to their success. Getting louder as they drink. Would you find it endearing and be happy for them? Possibly. Would it be annoying? Probably. Would you go home thinking they were assholes for ruining your romantic night? Most likely.", "INFO: Were you making him laugh to stop him from crying? Or was the laughing (and \"happy\" yelling) avoidable, excess noise in a public setting? If the alternative is crying, I'll take the laughing & yells lol. If he wasn't crying tho....I don't think I'd love that \"happy\" yelling", "YTA. Look, I hate the whole 'never take babies in public' thing, because babies need to exist in the world to help socialize them. But the caveat is that when you're somewhere where people expect volume to be modulated and the baby gets too loud (whether that's from laughing or crying, if we're dealing with screaming it's too loud), you *have* to take the baby outside. You keep saying 'happy yelling' like it's different from 'upset yelling.' I'm sure it's different to you and your wife, because you're excited to hear him be happy, but to your table neighbors? It's just a loud, piercing noise, and it's rude.", "YTA this is why I don\u2019t go out to eat and just order in if I\u2019m not cooking. People like you who have no consideration for those around you.", ">Him laughing is an issue?\n\nYep. YTA", "YTA. Yes, a happy baby is better than an angry baby, but you still have to be aware of the people around you. Shrieking laughing adults at dinner are not pleasant to be around either.", "Was he yelling or laughing?", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
