Those are not the same thing. A quiet giggle? Sure, no problem. But yelling? No. Just because it's happy, doesn't take away the fact that it's yelling.

Happy doesn't mean it's not still annoying.", "INFO: what were you doing to make him laugh?", "How can you not see that your screaming baby was preventing the other people in the restaurant from having a good time?

You deliberately provoked your kiddo into making loud noises in a place where people go to relax and enjoy conversation.

No one cares, really. Decibels are decibels.

There is time and place for making your baby laugh and yell like that, and that wasn't it.", "YTA. \n\nYou love your kid and think he's adorable but other people were there to enjoy a meal. You were deliberately attention seeking and probably wanted everyone to notice your wonderful baby, and were willing to give a \"fuck you\" to other paying patrons when asked to tone it down.\n\nHow tiresome. \n\nHope you left a really big tip for the extra inconvenience you placed on the staff too - having to move customers to a new table and deal with the complaints.", "YTA, there is a difference between a baby crying in a restaurant on its own, and you encouraging your baby to be loud by laughing.

I could get if you tried to make the baby laugh if he was already screaming/crying, but you stated in another comment that you made him laugh out of the blue by tickling him.

Had you stopped there then things probably would've been ok, but you continued the laughing anyway to just annoy everyone around you.", "Yta. I take my kids to restaurants all the time. I had to train them to do this. Babies- diners or family friendly restaurants only. If you want to try something not like that you have to be respectful of other people.

Once at the restaurant a group of 4 people get seated next to you. You find out that they are celebrating a windfall business deal because of how loud they are being. They cheer, and toast to their success. Getting louder as they drink. Would you find it endearing and be happy for them? Possibly. Would it be annoying? Probably. Would you go home thinking they were assholes for ruining your romantic night? Most likely.", "INFO: Were you making him laugh to stop him from crying? Or was the laughing (and \"happy\" yelling) avoidable, excess noise in a public setting? If the alternative is crying, I'll take the laughing & yells lol. If he wasn't crying tho....I don't think I'd love that \"happy\" yelling", "YTA. Look, I hate the whole 'never take babies in public' thing, because babies need to exist in the world to help socialize them. But the caveat is that when you're somewhere where people expect volume to be modulated and the baby gets too loud (whether that's from laughing or crying, if we're dealing with screaming it's too loud), you *have* to take the baby outside. You keep saying 'happy yelling' like it's different from 'upset yelling.' I'm sure it's different to you and your wife, because you're excited to hear him be happy, but to your table neighbors? It's just a loud, piercing noise, and it's rude.", "YTA this is why I don\u2019t go out to eat and just order in if I\u2019m not cooking.
