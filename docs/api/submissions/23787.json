Those are not the same thing. A quiet giggle? Sure, no problem. But yelling? No. Just because it's happy, doesn't take away the fact that it's yelling.

Happy doesn't mean it's not still annoying.", "INFO: what were you doing to make him laugh?", "How can you not see that your screaming baby was preventing the other people in the restaurant from having a good time?

You deliberately provoked your kiddo into making loud noises in a place where people go to relax and enjoy conversation.

No one cares, really. Decibels are decibels.

There is time and place for making your baby laugh and yell like that, and that wasn't it.", "YTA. \n\nYou love your kid and think he's adorable but other people were there to enjoy a meal. You were deliberately attention seeking and probably wanted everyone to notice your wonderful baby, and were willing to give a \"fuck you\" to other paying patrons when asked to tone it down.\n\nHow tiresome. \n\nHope you left a really big tip for the extra inconvenience you placed on the staff too - having to move customers to a new table and deal with the complaints.", "YTA, there is a difference between a baby crying in a restaurant on its own, and you encouraging your baby to be loud by laughing.

I could get if you tried to make the baby laugh if he was already screaming/crying, but you stated in another comment that you made him laugh out of the blue by tickling him.

Had you stopped there then things probably would've been ok, but you continued the laughing anyway to just annoy everyone around you.", "Yta. I take my kids to restaurants all the time. I had to train them to do this. Babies- diners or family friendly restaurants only. If you want to try something not like that you have to be respectful of other people.

Once at the restaurant a group of 4 people get seated next to you. You find out that they are celebrating a windfall business deal because of how loud they are being. They cheer, and toast to their success. Getting louder as they drink. Would you find it endearing and be happy for them? Possibly. Would it be annoying? Probably. Would you go home thinking they were assholes for ruining your romantic night? Most likely.", "INFO: Were you making him laugh to stop him from crying? Or was the laughing (and \"happy\" yelling) avoidable, excess noise in a public setting? If the alternative is crying, I'll take the laughing & yells lol. If he wasn't crying tho....I don't think I'd love that \"happy\" yelling", "YTA. Look, I hate the whole 'never take babies in public' thing, because babies need to exist in the world to help socialize them. But the caveat is that when you're somewhere where people expect volume to be modulated and the baby gets too loud (whether that's from laughing or crying, if we're dealing with screaming it's too loud), you *have* to take the baby outside. You keep saying 'happy yelling' like it's different from 'upset yelling.' I'm sure it's different to you and your wife, because you're excited to hear him be happy, but to your table neighbors? It's just a loud, piercing noise, and it's rude.", "YTA this is why I don\u2019t go out to eat and just order in if I\u2019m not cooking.

Most people love the sound of him laughing because it's adorable, but I'm not gonna tell someone who's ears are bleeding that the kid isn't a problem.", "Thank you!!!", "Look at the offended shitty parents giving you the nasty award lol", "Beautifully stated!", "I love my baby. He's relatively well-behaved. I love making him laugh-shriek (it's shockingly easy to do). I would never, under any circumstances, make him laugh-shriek in public.

You take them to those places.", "I don't even like kids, and I'm baffled at all the Y-T-As. I'd much rather hear a happy, laughing baby than a crying one whose family just ignores them.\n\nIf someone went up to adults who were enjoying a birthday celebration in a restaurant and told them they were being too loud (and they can definitely be very loud), most people would call that person uptight and a party-pooper. Do people really expect kiddo to sit silently for the duration of a birthday dinner?", "How are parents who insist that their children be allowed to be disruptive not also being individualistic/anti-social?

My family and I were at a very nice restaurant 2 nights ago. The family next to us were a large party who were drinking. Not drunk but on their way and they were LOUD.

Babies have as much right to be in the restaurant as everyone else. I\u2019m not even a parent but I can see how everyone is trying to isolate parents as if they are not even allowed to dine in a restaurant? Would you ask parents of kids with mental disability to also stay at home cuz it causes you minor inconvenience? How about grow some patience and stop expecting the world to cater and bow down to you? How about understand that the babies brain hasn\u2019t been developed yet and have some understanding towards another human experiencing life? How about stop being so selfish for once? Not everything is about you! It\u2019s not even like it was going on for hours, it was 10 minutes! Go sit at home and don\u2019t dine in a restaurant if babies bothers you so much, how about that?

But never once have I had someone give me stink eye or tell me I\u2019m being too loud. Babies get loud and they can\u2019t regulate it. It seems basic human decency is slipping now, since folks expect parents to be shut ins and a baby should never leave the house unless they\u2019re asleep. For what it\u2019s worth though, if my daughter was shrieking in joy at a restaurant and someone make a negative comment about it I\u2019d tell them to fuck right off.

I\u2019m visiting Sweden right now and I am amazed at how children are allowed to just fucking exist here. Who the fuck has an issue with a baby laughing?

I\u2019ll make my child laugh whenever I damn well please!", "Can\u2019t believe I had to scroll this far to see a reasonable opinion.

When they cried in a restaurant, they got whisked to the door.  When I played with them, we got as far as delighted chuckles, not screams. Once they got into the rambunctious age, we stopped going to mid-tier restaurants for awhile.  Why? Because I realized that our family wasn't the only one in the restaurant.  \n\nBabies are not entitled to a mid-level restaurant *if they are disrupting the restaurant*.  Flying on an airplane or walking through a public park or an aquarium or even the right kind of museum is \"babies existing in public\".

It was 5:30 on a Wednesday and it wasn't like the kid was crying. I also have a kid, parents are allowed to bring their kids out with them in public, it's not a crime. It sucks to feel like you have to live like a hermit while you have a baby for fear of other people's opinions of what your kid does in public.\n\nI also knew as soon as I read this that the people of Reddit would not be kind. Redditors seem to hate babies, idk what it is.", "THANK you. I have huge issues with loud sounds, and frankly I could listen to that baby laughing all day.

A baby laughing that hard at anything? Come on, I can't help but love it. That kid has no idea how to control his joy, has no inkling that joy is something that *should* ever be controlled, so he's just fucking ***happy*** and going to make sure everyone knows it.\n\nSo, no, I wouldn't be bothered by it.\n\nBut I'm not everyone.\n\nSome people feel differently, and they are bothered by this, and some for good reason, and the reasons can get dark.

He says they *asked* him to stop and keep it down. And his response was to discount how they felt and keep at it for 3 to 5 minutes. That's where the problem comes in.\n\nWould I have stopped making my kid laugh? No. But I'd have taken him off somewhere that I wouldn't knowingly bother other people. That's where this becomes a problem. Maybe not full on \"ASSHOLE\" level, but it's not a great look.", "OP said it was nicer than a Chilis but not quite white table cloth nice.
