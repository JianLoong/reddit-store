To you, it feels like enforcing consequences, but to the people seeing your post, it looks immature, petty, and possibly even a little toxic. People have a sort of unspoken consent process in their interactions; we start with small talk, and if both parties engage, that\u2019s consenting to the small talk; someone then ventures to a slightly more personal topic, and if the other reciprocates, that\u2019s consent to the slightly more intimate level of conversation \u2014 and so on and so forth. It\u2019s why we feel awkward or uncomfortable seeing highly-personal posts on social media, or when a stranger approaches us to launch into a story of all their traumas; we haven\u2019t consented to that intimate an exchange, so our boundaries feel violated. Those boundaries *should* be knocked down for some topics (it\u2019s valuable to introduce discomfort if it\u2019s addressing racism, ableism, homophobia, etc), but when it\u2019s done to share family drama, it just looks unhealthy. It may get you a couple people validating your feelings, but it leads even more people to question your sense of boundaries.\n\nNext time, choose consequences that actually address the behavior \u2014 eg, a police report or small claims court. Don\u2019t rely on people on social media to create the consequences (shaming) for you.", "NAH.
