For starters Kate lives with me rent free and bill free. She used to live with her mother full time but her mom kicked her out at 18. I don\u2019t blame her mother though. Kate was absolutely terrible in her teenager years. She was rude, disrespectful and would steal,smoke, skip class,etc. Kate barely finished high school and was put in a continuation school. Since this though Kate is doing a lot better, she didn\u2019t want to go to college but she works at a fast food restaurant and is saving up for her own apartment. \n\nAlexa on the other hand is the opposite, she\u2019s amazing in school, works, volunteers  and still has time to do sports and clubs. I\u2019m extremely proud of her and feel as if she puts too much pressure on herself. Me and my girlfriend decided to surprise her on a vacation. Alexa has always wanted to go there and it wasn\u2019t as pricey as we expected. We planned this in early October.\n\nI told Kate about the vacation and asked if she wanted to come, but she would have to pay her own ticket.She said yes and would give me the money before Halloween. Well she never gave me the money even after being reminded, so I booked the trip November 1 for the 18-21 of November. I told my daughter this Sunday at dinner and she was very excited, Kate then said \u201c you\u2019ll have to cancel and hope they refund. I work those days.\u201d I told her she wasn\u2019t coming since she didn\u2019t pay. She was confused and thought I was paying for her. I told her that she was an adult who worked and lived  free, why would I pay. She got upset and said because I\u2019m her daughter and that I was paying for Alexa so why not her. An argument then happened which resulted in Alexa and Kate crying and Kate saying she hated me.\n\n Kate has been ignoring us until we apologize and pay her ticket, which I won\u2019t. Well yesterday Alexa sent me a link to a video on tick Tock where it shows Kate crying and explaining the situation, but she lied about a lot of things in the videos and made Alexa and I look like bad guys. The video got a lot of attention and support. She even opened up a go fund me where she received close to 500 dollars. I showed my girlfriend and we were both livid, Alexa was also very upset about the comments which fueled my anger. When she came home a huge argument broke out and I basically kicked her out for the week. \n\nShe\u2019s been posting on social media platforms talking about me, my daughter and girlfriend. My daughter even got some nasty messages on her social media. My girlfriend told me I\u2019m right on this but my daughter told me to just pay for her ticket. I want to know if I\u2019m doing the right decision, so help.", "created_utc": 1668145698, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ys2i5a/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_for_my_daughters_plane/", "score": 1312, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're rewarding her discipline with a holiday, to further entrench the value of a strong worth ethic.

Maybe you can reward her with a holiday once she has achieved what she has set out to accomplish by buying her apartment.\n\nOr not.

I'd be pretty upset too if I felt like my parents were totally favoring my younger sibling.\n\nAlso, while sure, 23 is an adult, it's hardly some unusual event for a 23 year old to still be living at home while they save up for their own place. It's nice that you're letting her live there rent-free, but she's not some random tenant, she's a part of your family, and probably (and I would say rightfully) feels incredibly hurt that you're all going on vacation without her.\n\nYou're obviously within your rights to say she has to pay her own way, and her reaction is immature, but you might want to look in the mirror a little bit as to why her reaction is what it is.", "ESH. With Kate, she is being manipulative enough said  as other comments have gone into better description. \n\nAnd with you, OP these behaviours don\u2019t just appear out of the woodworks. It\u2019s hard for me not to see this as favouritism. And telling her she needs to pay isn\u2019t clear beyond stating an expectation. Does she have much financial literacy? To juggle saving for her own place and to save of trip, that seems like a lot. \n\nWith you, have you been to family therapy? I highly suggest you do.

If Alexa is saying you should pay for Kate, then Alexa is not little miss perfect you make her out to be...especially if she is causing drama over it.  You and your girlfriend decide to surprise the \"good\" daughter with a vacation.  OK, nothing wrong with that, at first glance.  However, did anybody ever do the same for Kate?  I'm not talking about since she turned 18.  I'm talking about, ever...at any time in her life?\n\nIf the youngest child gets a free vacation on dad, but the older child never got a free vacation from anybody, then that...sucks for the older child.

Both of your daughters sound like people to be proud of.\n\nI don't know what caused the trouble for Kate when she was a teenager, but I do know that getting kicked out by her mother had to have been pretty painful.

Sorry.", "YTA. You sound like a really awful and manipulative father. Alexa probably \u201cputs too much pressure\u201d on herself because she watched you and their mother treat Kate like shit.

So, she misunderstood who was paying and you just silently booked the tickets without any word to her? No, \"Hey I'm booking the vacation Sunday. How are you on saving up your money?\" That's sneaky and quite frankly sounds calculating. 2. You are celebrating one kid by leaving out another. You don't choose travel as a family activity unless you really don't want the family member making sh*t wages at a fast food restaurant to attend. Again, calculating and sneaky. 3.

OP has also mentioned in the comments that they did stuff like this for Kate in the past as well, so this doesn't seem to be some special treatment just for Alexa either.\n\nTreating siblings fairly doesn't mean that they always have to get the exact same thing, it just means that they should get the same amount of love, attention and support. OP *is* treating Kate as an equal - his other daughter was gifted a trip and she was still invited and (as an adult) asked to pay her own way. OP has done similar things for Kate in the past. I don't see how any of this is unfair.\n\nI am an older sibling myself and sometimes my younger sibling gets things I didn't have at their age or is allowed to do things I wasn't or gets to go on a trip that I'm not part of. That's normal. I genuinely wouldn't be mad in the scenario OP describes either for the reasons I outlined above. What isn't normal though is throwing an enormous tantrum about something like this at 23.\n\nNTA in my opinion.", "This made me laugh. I reminded her multiple times. I actually told her right before I booked. She strictly chose NOT TO PAY. Probably should have made that clear. She earns $15 an hour, she doesn\u2019t pay anything, not even her phone bill.

She seems to have problems planning ahead for one. Problems going through school as well.\n\nMaybe OP should evaluate if his older daughter received all the support *she* needs to succeed in life.

Whether or not your daughter was a problem child is really irrelevant to this situation. She was *a child*. \n\nYour daughter sucks for taking it to social media and not paying when she agreed to pay, but I\u2019m inclined to believe there\u2019s more to this story based on the way you worded your post and comments alone. There is a reason your daughter feels this way. There is a reason she was exhibiting these symptoms of rebellion and attention-seeking behavior in her formative years. It\u2019s concerning to me that you\u2019d rather get judged on whether or not you\u2019re an asshole instead of getting to the bottom of why your daughter thinks you are one.

Not saying it wasn't her fault or she is innocent, but I am saying that you have to let it go at some point.

Nature and nurture are both things. My oldest is obsessed with sports. There is no one in her life that likes sports.

Protect yourself and your minor child. Kick her out and let her figure it out. Silent treatment to get her way is emotional abuse.", "I\u2019m going to disagree with the masses on this one. One of the first unwritten rules of parenting is you never show favoritism\u2014 unless you want it to come around and bite you in the ass later in life.\n\nSure, she\u2019s an adult. Sure, she lives rent-free, and allegedly has no bills (I don\u2019t buy that assessment, though). But who set up that system in the first place? You, or her? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s reasonable to come back later and upend the expectations and understanding of a system you yourself had a hand in creating. \n\nThat being said, teaching your child a sense of responsibility, particularly when it comes to finances, is important. But the way you went about it, by leaving to fester what clearly seemed to be a misunderstanding on her part in regards to your travel arrangement/offer, until nearly the date of travel, rather than making sure she understood that she has to pay for it LONG BEFORE it was nearly time to tell Alexa, especially when she began to give any suspicions that she wasn\u2019t going to give you any payments, might not have been the best course of action if the goal was to have her along, yet still help make her accountable for her own travel arrangements.\n\nI note at the beginning of your post you state, \u201cKATE (emphasis added) was absolutely terrible in her teenage years\u2026\u201d Stop right there. \n\nDid you ever stop to think \u201cwhy\u201d she was so \u201cterrible?\u201d When children of any age in their formative years exhibit destructive behaviors, including substance abuse, an adverse change in the type of friends with whom they associate, stealing to support a habit, and certainly skipping class, it\u2019s usually a manifestation of the inner turmoil or complex emotions they do not know how to process on their own, particularly in cases of traumatic elements of their environments. From the sound of it, since \u201cshe used to live with her mother,\u201d perhaps she acted out during high school because she was dealing with your separation with her mom (assuming you are her biological parent), or perhaps she was being bullied at school and felt she had no one to turn to, or perhaps she felt neither of her parents loved her enough to stay together (I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s factually the case, but those are certainly common feelings teenagers dealing with the emotional instability a divorce can cause).\n\nKids are not born as \u201cproblem children;\u201d They learn it from their environments, and it\u2019s easy to pin it all on them, but if a parent does not fully investigate the roots of these destructive behaviors, and make good faith efforts to address, if not remedy them, then the parent is jointly liable, in my mind, for those self-same behaviors. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.\n\nI think a better approach would have been to have her sign a contract, detailing the schedule and expectations of payments, since in its basic form, that\u2019s what your arrangement was (e.g. the \u2018offer\u2019 of her getting to go on vacation with you, if she provides the \u2018consideration,\u2019 in the form of monetary installment payments). Though it might seem excessive to some, having seen many of these types of familial misunderstandings and disagreements, if it\u2019s all spelled out in writing, and she agrees to the terms via her signature, any misunderstandings can be quickly remedied by referring her to what she signed, negating feelings of her need to trash talk her family and seek help on Go Fund Me\u2026 even if you secretly have no intent to enforce the contract.\n\n(Incidentally, unless she misrepresented a material fact with the intent of deceiving those donating money to her cause, she technically may not have defrauded anyone, depending on what she actually said in her posts\u2026 none of us know, as we weren\u2019t privy to them\u2026and, of course, your state\u2019s fraud laws; so filing charges against her or referring her case to the District Attorney probably wouldn\u2019t be the best option, if you\u2019re just trying to teach her responsibility/accountability.)\n\nBut ultimately, the vacation is/was supposed to be about Alexa, and if she is close enough with Kate that she wanted her to come, it might have been a good idea just to foot the bill for Alexa\u2019s sake, and work out the details with Kate after the trip\u2026 even if you never see a dime in repayment. \n\n(My personal belief/approach is that when it comes to friends and family, any lent money, or negotiations are just gifts to them in my mind, meaning I don\u2019t expect it back\u2026 but obviously, if they take advantage of my generosity or kindness, I just don\u2019t get involved with them financially going forward).\n\nSorry, I have a bad habit of turning these posts into essays, so my apologies lol.\n\nBecause of the format of this forum, I unfortunately have to opine you are the asshole in this case. Though, I personally think the two of you probably just don\u2019t relate to each other on some level, so you two exhibit your frustrations with each other in conflicting ways\u2014 hers probably being a little more extreme, due to her (as I like to say) \u201cyouthful indiscretions.\u201d\n\nI hope Alexa had a great time, and things work out between you and Kate.

Why, because she's somehow more accomplished than your older daughter?? That's how you make it seem.

I doubt that she makes enough money at her fast food job in order to pay for a ticket for a family vacation! A family vacation that *YOU* invited her on!  Most people are living paycheck to paycheck! Not only that, but *you know* that she's working here butt off to save money in order to move out of your house! In order to live on her own like any responsible adult! And yet, you threw it in her face that she gets to live their rent free, as if everything she's doing to better her situation just means absolutely nothing to you! That's just not okay, imo. \n\nDon't be surprised when she moves out finally and goes full No Contact with all of you! I won't blame her either.

Anyways, I got medication for it and have been using it. I do what my parents ask whenever they ask, help them out whenever they need it, cook once a week for everyone etc. I'm not exactly a copy of Kate, but something similar does happen to me.\n\nBack to that gacha game; my dad has been warning me about spending money on that game. Because it's halting my savings, he wants me to stop spending on it entirely. Since I enjoy it so much, I ignored it, and he kept telling me about it. It's not an unhealthy amount and I don't take stuff out of my savings for it, but it still bothers him. Because of this, he told me to pay for the medicine myself as well as the majority of groceries I ask for for my mom to pick up when she does them. (I go myself on Saturdays but she goes to different stores than I do which have different things I need). I agreed because its only normal. I paid for it all, I'm not bothered by it.\n\nRecently they've also been talking about going to a trip to Indonesia and have everything planned out except when the trip will be. They asked me to come for free. I checked it out and because its such a hectic schedule, I told them it would be bad because I'd grow extremely tired. Note that Indonesia is our country of origin so it holds significant meaning to us. My mom offered a different vacation and gave Disney land Paris as option. I refused because I'm more into rollercoasters than she is and its still too expensive. She offered to pay for it, but since I have a full time job now I want to pitch in. If I wanted to go to Indonesia, I would have paid most of my ticket. If I wanted to go to Disney land Paris, I would have paid most of my ticket.\n\nI'm not the best daughter in the world.

Sometimes it's simply what you have at the time to offer and not disparity or victimizing or anything more than simply - 7 years is a pretty big gap and circumstances CHANGE.

They still to this day give support (unasked for) and always view their children as individual that need different things but they just don\u2019t seem to focus on one kid.  And they don\u2019t announce a huge present/gift in front of their other kids and leave them high and dry, or in the dark. (In the post it read as they had one conversation about the trip).\n\nI said I think Kate\u2019s action suck but seriously I get why she\u2019s upset with her father.  Should she have gone on TikTok and lie.  Nope.  Should she had made herself a victim no.  She\u2019s definitely an A H for those actions.  \n\nAnd I get it Alexa deserves something for her achievements.  Yes but the way it was done in front of Kate was not right.  Also the way OP writes the post seems like he doesn\u2019t really like Kate and she should be kissing his butt for letting her live there.  I this he is the AH as well.

Ten years ago ADHD etc were viewed differently. It's been known for a long time that ADHD presents very differently in girls than in boys, and it wouldn't be surprising for it to simply have been overlooked, if that's Kate's problem.  Looking into this (and any other NT possibilities) would be a mercy for both OP and Kate.

I asked why is it different. If its different because Kate's an adult, I accept that. But, OP did not answer and so, this is an assumption. (Not an unreasonable assumption.

Again and sincerely, \"THANKS.\"", "The thing is that she's not 16 trying to figure herself out. She's an adult that have a job and think that she can do whatever she wants without consequences. Yes, parents always have to care about their children, but that doesn't mean that they have to suffer everything that their children thrown at them, she wasn't a good daughter, and clearly is not a good person, we can know this because she not only wants to other people solve her problems, but without any hesitation make others believe that she's a victim and doesn't care if strangers on the internet start to bullying her family. Yes, the parents have to care about their children, but with this type of daughter, love and care is not gonna change anything.", "She can use her gofundme money for an apartment \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Kate is committing a crime with that gofundme.

Her mom put her out for a reason and it seems the reason still exists. And now because she doesn't get her way she is lying to get money off of strangers and slandering not only the one parent who has helped her but a minor child?  Hmmmm kick her out OR press charges against her?? I'd just kick her out...believe me, she'll get charges pressed against her eventually because she's a user, and when users can't use then they start doing illegal things to get by coz God help em, they never want to do anything the correct way.

I wouldn't let a stranger stay in my house that behaved this way and I for sure wouldn't allow someone I'd provided for stay in my house and treat their sister or myself this way.  Kate needs to start learning hard lessons! OR like I said before, press charges, she'll have a place to stay then...or evict her, of course then the courts would have to be told why & that in itself could cause Kate legal issues...Kicking her out at least prevents her getting involved in the legal system.  I love how someone want to defend the user bum and make everyone else continue to suffer. NOT AT MY HOUSE", "Op hasn't said anything that indicates that it was fraudulent at all.

The one without evaluation/diagnosis is 'counseling'.\n\nAt no point has OP \"written her off\". You're reaching.

But my parents have never treated me differently after I got past all of that, while you still seem to hold onto it as an excuse to favour Alexa. \n\nYou seem disinclined to acknowledge that there is any favouritism at all, even though multiple people have told you that your whole post reeks of it: calling Alex \u2018your daughter\u2019 multiple times while referring to Kate only by name, as though she isn\u2019t your daughter too. While this doesn\u2019t excuse Kate\u2019s actions of lying on social media, you aren\u2019t all that innocent in this, either.\n\nBut hey, you\u2019ll probably just ignore this comment like you\u2019ve ignored every other calling you out.", "I was only replying to your second comment where you asked if she is supposed to pay her own way.

Maybe he's being overly negative since he's pissed off about the situation, but if this is indicative of his usual behaviour he's an asshole.\n\nI agree that Kate definitely acted in a shitty and manipulative way. The way OP handled it was pretty passive aggressive to. He waited until he and his other daughter were celebrating in order to inform her that she's not going. Of course he knew this would upset her and cause a fight. Kate and OP's relationship just seems so dysfunctional and the whole situation is just from them being shitty to each other.", "She doesn't pay for anything though, so she can spend everything she earns on whatever she wants!", "It blows my mind that people apparently think that adult children are entitled to live rent free indefinitely, regardless of their behaviour.", "tough", "She was still going with the gofundme when OP wrote this.

If someone had just started to spread lies about me on social media, I wouldn't have many nice things to say about them either.\n\nI just want to add though that OP didn't just wait, he did remind her about the money and everything. She was well aware, she just ignored it. I don't know what else he should have done.\n\nI do agree that their relationship seems dysfunctional though, and I wonder why she thinks her behavior is appropriate in any way. However, I don't like playing armchair psychologist and there is probably much more context we can't possibly guess from one post, so based just on this post and the information we got from it and the comments, I'll stick to saying OP is NTA in this specific situation.
