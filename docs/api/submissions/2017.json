For starters Kate lives with me rent free and bill free. She used to live with her mother full time but her mom kicked her out at 18. I don\u2019t blame her mother though. Kate was absolutely terrible in her teenager years. She was rude, disrespectful and would steal,smoke, skip class,etc. Kate barely finished high school and was put in a continuation school. Since this though Kate is doing a lot better, she didn\u2019t want to go to college but she works at a fast food restaurant and is saving up for her own apartment. \n\nAlexa on the other hand is the opposite, she\u2019s amazing in school, works, volunteers  and still has time to do sports and clubs. I\u2019m extremely proud of her and feel as if she puts too much pressure on herself. Me and my girlfriend decided to surprise her on a vacation. Alexa has always wanted to go there and it wasn\u2019t as pricey as we expected. We planned this in early October.\n\nI told Kate about the vacation and asked if she wanted to come, but she would have to pay her own ticket.She said yes and would give me the money before Halloween. Well she never gave me the money even after being reminded, so I booked the trip November 1 for the 18-21 of November. I told my daughter this Sunday at dinner and she was very excited, Kate then said \u201c you\u2019ll have to cancel and hope they refund. I work those days.\u201d I told her she wasn\u2019t coming since she didn\u2019t pay. She was confused and thought I was paying for her. I told her that she was an adult who worked and lived  free, why would I pay. She got upset and said because I\u2019m her daughter and that I was paying for Alexa so why not her. An argument then happened which resulted in Alexa and Kate crying and Kate saying she hated me.\n\n Kate has been ignoring us until we apologize and pay her ticket, which I won\u2019t. Well yesterday Alexa sent me a link to a video on tick Tock where it shows Kate crying and explaining the situation, but she lied about a lot of things in the videos and made Alexa and I look like bad guys. The video got a lot of attention and support. She even opened up a go fund me where she received close to 500 dollars. I showed my girlfriend and we were both livid, Alexa was also very upset about the comments which fueled my anger. When she came home a huge argument broke out and I basically kicked her out for the week. \n\nShe\u2019s been posting on social media platforms talking about me, my daughter and girlfriend. My daughter even got some nasty messages on her social media. My girlfriend told me I\u2019m right on this but my daughter told me to just pay for her ticket. I want to know if I\u2019m doing the right decision, so help.", "created_utc": 1668145698, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ys2i5a/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_for_my_daughters_plane/", "score": 72, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're rewarding her discipline with a holiday, to further entrench the value of a strong worth ethic.

Maybe you can reward her with a holiday once she has achieved what she has set out to accomplish by buying her apartment.\n\nOr not.

I'd be pretty upset too if I felt like my parents were totally favoring my younger sibling.\n\nAlso, while sure, 23 is an adult, it's hardly some unusual event for a 23 year old to still be living at home while they save up for their own place. It's nice that you're letting her live there rent-free, but she's not some random tenant, she's a part of your family, and probably (and I would say rightfully) feels incredibly hurt that you're all going on vacation without her.\n\nYou're obviously within your rights to say she has to pay her own way, and her reaction is immature, but you might want to look in the mirror a little bit as to why her reaction is what it is.", "ESH. With Kate, she is being manipulative enough said  as other comments have gone into better description. \n\nAnd with you, OP these behaviours don\u2019t just appear out of the woodworks. It\u2019s hard for me not to see this as favouritism. And telling her she needs to pay isn\u2019t clear beyond stating an expectation. Does she have much financial literacy? To juggle saving for her own place and to save of trip, that seems like a lot. \n\nWith you, have you been to family therapy? I highly suggest you do.

You and your girlfriend decide to surprise the \"good\" daughter with a vacation.  OK, nothing wrong with that, at first glance.  However, did anybody ever do the same for Kate?  I'm not talking about since she turned 18.  I'm talking about, ever...at any time in her life?\n\nIf the youngest child gets a free vacation on dad, but the older child never got a free vacation from anybody, then that...sucks for the older child.

So, she misunderstood who was paying and you just silently booked the tickets without any word to her? No, \"Hey I'm booking the vacation Sunday.

You don't choose travel as a family activity unless you really don't want the family member making sh*t wages at a fast food restaurant to attend. Again, calculating and sneaky. 3.

She didn\u2019t need to run to social media and lie, it\u2019s sad and she ruined a good thing for her sister.", "No favoritism, I\u2019ve done things like this for Kate too. I was very involved, me and Kates mom are from Mexico. I am specifically doing this for Alexa because I feel like she deserves it for all she\u2019s done, I\u2019m proud of them both just for different things.", "Not to mention Alexa is a minor\u2026 makes sense her ticket is being paid.", "What more does she need to learn? Sounds like neither parent really wanted her growing up and OP clearly favored (and still does) her half sister over her.", "I know. I don\u2019t get her.", "She's living rent free and working, yes she's saving up for an apartment but I highly doubt all the money she's not paying towards rent and food is going towards the apartment", "I\u2019m just curious what the GFM is even for.. it\u2019s a quick way to get caught up on fraud charges if she\u2019s lying about where the funds would go.", "Alexa\u2019s mother is dead", "Even if OP looks down on Kate for being a former problem child, how does that change the fact Kate initially agreed to pay for her own ticket?", "Also why is this celebration set up in a way that makes it hard for Kate to celebrate her sister alexa?", "Yeah. Sort of felt like Kate was acting out because neither parent wanted her.", "The other daughter is an adult living rent and bill free. Equity is different from equality", "She's treated differently because she has made different choices all along.  She's 7 years older, living rent free with her dad and wants to go on a vacation that was specifically planned to provide some relaxation for her minor sister.   She was told to save money and didn't bother to do that or even let her dad know when she would be free.", "You\u2019re right, her mom doesn\u2019t want her in her life because Kate was very emotionally and physically abusive to her. I love both my daughters and want them both in my life. Kate is an adult who can pay. I treat them both differently because they are different.", "One of his children is a minor for whom he is legally responsible.  One of his children is an employed adult who lives rent and bill free in his home.  Do you understand the difference?", "I'm not sure I understand why a 23-year old, living for free with her parent would think she should automatically be included in a vacation that she was told would not be free for her.", "One is an adult though? She's living there rent free and bill free.", "I don't think this is about playing favourites, but about the fact that a) this is explicitly a gift for one of them and b) one of them is 16 and in school while the other is 23 and earns her own money. OP has also mentioned in the comments that they did stuff like this for Kate in the past as well, so this doesn't seem to be some special treatment just for Alexa either.\n\nTreating siblings fairly doesn't mean that they always have to get the exact same thing, it just means that they should get the same amount of love, attention and support. OP *is* treating Kate as an equal - his other daughter was gifted a trip and she was still invited and (as an adult) asked to pay her own way. OP has done similar things for Kate in the past. I don't see how any of this is unfair.\n\nI am an older sibling myself and sometimes my younger sibling gets things I didn't have at their age or is allowed to do things I wasn't or gets to go on a trip that I'm not part of. That's normal. I genuinely wouldn't be mad in the scenario OP describes either for the reasons I outlined above. What isn't normal though is throwing an enormous tantrum about something like this at 23.\n\nNTA in my opinion.", "This made me laugh. I reminded her multiple times. I actually told her right before I booked. She strictly chose NOT TO PAY. Probably should have made that clear. She earns $15 an hour, she doesn\u2019t pay anything, not even her phone bill. I expect her to have about $200-400 saved up. I don\u2019t have any secret agenda against my own daughter. I encourage her to do better, I even want her to see therapists and receive help even though she is a lot better. she\u2019s her own worse enemy which hurts me.", "Nope, my girlfriend is paying a portion of the whole trip.", "I\u2019ve taken her on trips before. Alexa doesn\u2019t have her mother here with us today. My girlfriend has no blood connection to either of my girls. My girlfriend paid her share, I only wanted her to pay the ticket.", "Are you paying for your girlfriend or is she paying her own way?", "Did you take Kate on her dream vacation when she was younger?", "Well she's supposedly been saving to get her own apartment, so why wouldn't she have given him the money when he told he she would have to pay for her ticket?", "wouldnt she have been able to request off? either way i think you should sit down with kate and talk about her upbringing because you clearly favor your other daughter and that behavior is not helping kate at all. like money aside she IS your daughter and you should be taking steps to help her get through whatever she needs to get through and be a stronger support system", "You not getting her sounds more like a feature than a bug. Have you ever tried to \u201cget her?\u201d You mentioned you\u2019ve encouraged her to go to therapy. If you\u2019re truly as proud of your daughter  Kate as you say you are, show her by going to therapy with her. If she\u2019s acting out, you have to take responsibility for your part in her behavior. She\u2019s 23 now;  if she\u2019s felt unseen or disrespected by her parents from the jump then I\u2019m sure the behavior she exhibited as a teen/exhibits now started waaaaaaaay way before then. Look in the mirror my dude.", "how is it hard for kate to celebrate alexa? /gen", "Then maybe you need to take an objective step back and think how Kate feels. Rejected by her parents to a degree, clearly not the favourite, clearly acted out as a teen, what did you to help her?", "That's one way to see it. The other way is that she has some difficulties. She seems to have problems planning ahead for one. Problems going through school as well.\n\nMaybe OP should evaluate if his older daughter received all the support *she* needs to succeed in life. OP shouldn't be too quick to attribute her failings to character flaws when it could as well be special needs.", "OP should have just offered to pay for her. She was invited so this seems like it was meant to be a family celebration. It would be shitty if she was left out just because she can't afford it.", "Sorry to say this but what started the Abusive behavior? Remember that you both were responsible for raising a blank slate and turning them into a member of society but if she learned to retaliate based on being verbally and physically abused, well then you often get this type of situation. Of course, that's not the full story.", "Thank you. I feel like people are just glazing over the fact that she's living rent and bill free.", "Obviously Kate seems irresponsible for her age and is lucky to have somewhere to live rent free, but there is still some clear favoritism going on. This sounds like it's supposed to be a family vacation since his girlfriend is coming too. He should just pay for both of them instead of trying to teach some stupid lesson. She's likely working some shitty minimum wage job and I'm sure she's not super pleased about her living situation either. Why not just treat everyone so no one is excluded?", "I highly doubt the non favorite child and \u201cthe opposite\u201d of \u201camazing\u201d Alexa was ever taken on her dream holiday when she was younger. He literally says he treats them differently in the comments.", "Don\u2019t listen to this nonsense. My brother was/is the same way, and at 28 has still failed to launch because he has absolutely never been held accountable. Having a job is enough in my parents eyes, even if he pays for none of his living expenses. Blows his money gambling and watching sports.\n\nThis should be a huge wake up call for her. Tough love in early 20s to avoid it in late 20s/30s.", "I feel really sorry for your daughter. It seems like all of the adults in her life failed her. I hope one they you can look at your daughter with kinder eyes and be honest enough to own up for the role you played and didn\u2019t play as her father.", "> I reminded her multiple times. I actually told her right before I booked. \n\nThat definitely should have been in the OP.", "Didn't you also say she's also saving up for her own apartment. Working a 15/hr job even full time makes it hard to save up for anything. Do you expect her to use the money she saved up to get her own place to pay for the vacation? One month wouldn't be enough to save for both a 200-400 vacation with a 15/hr job..", "That\u2019s honestly not relevant at all", "I strongly suspect that Kate is the type of person to actively look for a hair in her soup and is not above putting that hair there herself. Feeding of drama.", "Not OP", "She definitely has problems planning.  She was with her mom until she was 18.  It might be good for the OP to sit down with her and talk about some achievable goal and a plan.", "He told her from the beginning that she would have to pay her own way.  At no point did she come back and say that she was having trouble coming up with money, nor did she ask for dates to request time off from work.   There was no effort at all on her own part.", "There are cockoo chicks who murder their siblings moments after hatching. \n\nEvery now and then a rotten human is born instead of raised. They exist.", "Depending on where they live, some places that\u2019s the average for pay for not having any degrees. Also, she pays no rent. She probably pays for food and gas and maintenance for her car if she even has one and the rest is open for other things. If she doesn\u2019t have a vehicle and OP or his gf is the ones always cooking, what really is she spending her money on that she can\u2019t pay for a plane ticket or have even a bit of money saved up for?", "She\u2019s been working for 4 years and doesn\u2019t pay bills. She has money, a lot of it. Still don\u2019t expect her to pay anything. She can live with me until she\u2019s 40, I don\u2019t care. If she wants to move out, that\u2019s her decision. The vacation is optional. My girlfriend was invited and paid half of the hotel, her ticket and fees. Alexa is also a minor and 16. I don\u2019t expect my daughters to pay, especially when it\u2019s a gift.", "What do you mean? I work part time $8 for 19 hours a week and get roughly $300 biweekly. If she warns $15 as a full time employee and somehow makes less than me, she needs better hours imo\n\n(Also OP NTA, I recognize Kate\u2019s behavior cuz I would do it to my mom and it was tough love that set me straight)", "If he is paying for his girlfriend to go (who I am assuming is an adult) it would be hypocritical not to pay for his daughter using the excuse that she is an adult. Is his girlfriend also an underage overachiever that gets a paid vacation?", "Sorry didn't pay attention to names. But that's my thought too. Kate is reacting based on how her parents have treated her, they in turn react to that and it's just a vicious, hurtful cycle.", "Obviously Kate didn't act perfectly in this situation but this whole fiasco could have been avoided so easily. He could even offer to pay for the vacation and have her pay him back in installments. That way she gets to go and he gets to teach her some financial responsibility. I really think OP should have just paid for her, but I think that would be a fair compromise. \n\nThere are a hundred different ways this situation could have been handled better and that's what makes OP the asshole."]}
