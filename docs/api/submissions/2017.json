For starters Kate lives with me rent free and bill free. She used to live with her mother full time but her mom kicked her out at 18. I don\u2019t blame her mother though. Kate was absolutely terrible in her teenager years. She was rude, disrespectful and would steal,smoke, skip class,etc. Kate barely finished high school and was put in a continuation school. Since this though Kate is doing a lot better, she didn\u2019t want to go to college but she works at a fast food restaurant and is saving up for her own apartment. \n\nAlexa on the other hand is the opposite, she\u2019s amazing in school, works, volunteers  and still has time to do sports and clubs. I\u2019m extremely proud of her and feel as if she puts too much pressure on herself. Me and my girlfriend decided to surprise her on a vacation. Alexa has always wanted to go there and it wasn\u2019t as pricey as we expected. We planned this in early October.\n\nI told Kate about the vacation and asked if she wanted to come, but she would have to pay her own ticket.She said yes and would give me the money before Halloween. Well she never gave me the money even after being reminded, so I booked the trip November 1 for the 18-21 of November. I told my daughter this Sunday at dinner and she was very excited, Kate then said \u201c you\u2019ll have to cancel and hope they refund. I work those days.\u201d I told her she wasn\u2019t coming since she didn\u2019t pay. She was confused and thought I was paying for her. I told her that she was an adult who worked and lived  free, why would I pay. She got upset and said because I\u2019m her daughter and that I was paying for Alexa so why not her. An argument then happened which resulted in Alexa and Kate crying and Kate saying she hated me.\n\n Kate has been ignoring us until we apologize and pay her ticket, which I won\u2019t. Well yesterday Alexa sent me a link to a video on tick Tock where it shows Kate crying and explaining the situation, but she lied about a lot of things in the videos and made Alexa and I look like bad guys. The video got a lot of attention and support. She even opened up a go fund me where she received close to 500 dollars. I showed my girlfriend and we were both livid, Alexa was also very upset about the comments which fueled my anger. When she came home a huge argument broke out and I basically kicked her out for the week. \n\nShe\u2019s been posting on social media platforms talking about me, my daughter and girlfriend. My daughter even got some nasty messages on her social media. My girlfriend told me I\u2019m right on this but my daughter told me to just pay for her ticket. I want to know if I\u2019m doing the right decision, so help.", "created_utc": 1668145698, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ys2i5a/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_for_my_daughters_plane/", "score": 507, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're rewarding her discipline with a holiday, to further entrench the value of a strong worth ethic.

Maybe you can reward her with a holiday once she has achieved what she has set out to accomplish by buying her apartment.\n\nOr not.

She should've taken this as a learning experience. \n\nThat said, if she's not yet in therapy, she should be. Whatever caused her to act out in the first place is still there.

I'd be pretty upset too if I felt like my parents were totally favoring my younger sibling.\n\nAlso, while sure, 23 is an adult, it's hardly some unusual event for a 23 year old to still be living at home while they save up for their own place. It's nice that you're letting her live there rent-free, but she's not some random tenant, she's a part of your family, and probably (and I would say rightfully) feels incredibly hurt that you're all going on vacation without her.\n\nYou're obviously within your rights to say she has to pay her own way, and her reaction is immature, but you might want to look in the mirror a little bit as to why her reaction is what it is.", "ESH. With Kate, she is being manipulative enough said  as other comments have gone into better description. \n\nAnd with you, OP these behaviours don\u2019t just appear out of the woodworks. It\u2019s hard for me not to see this as favouritism. And telling her she needs to pay isn\u2019t clear beyond stating an expectation. Does she have much financial literacy? To juggle saving for her own place and to save of trip, that seems like a lot. \n\nWith you, have you been to family therapy? I highly suggest you do.

If Alexa is saying you should pay for Kate, then Alexa is not little miss perfect you make her out to be...especially if she is causing drama over it.  You and your girlfriend decide to surprise the \"good\" daughter with a vacation.  OK, nothing wrong with that, at first glance.  However, did anybody ever do the same for Kate?  I'm not talking about since she turned 18.  I'm talking about, ever...at any time in her life?\n\nIf the youngest child gets a free vacation on dad, but the older child never got a free vacation from anybody, then that...sucks for the older child.

Both of your daughters sound like people to be proud of.\n\nI don't know what caused the trouble for Kate when she was a teenager, but I do know that getting kicked out by her mother had to have been pretty painful.

So, she misunderstood who was paying and you just silently booked the tickets without any word to her? No, \"Hey I'm booking the vacation Sunday. How are you on saving up your money?\" That's sneaky and quite frankly sounds calculating. 2. You are celebrating one kid by leaving out another. You don't choose travel as a family activity unless you really don't want the family member making sh*t wages at a fast food restaurant to attend. Again, calculating and sneaky. 3.

OP has also mentioned in the comments that they did stuff like this for Kate in the past as well, so this doesn't seem to be some special treatment just for Alexa either.\n\nTreating siblings fairly doesn't mean that they always have to get the exact same thing, it just means that they should get the same amount of love, attention and support. OP *is* treating Kate as an equal - his other daughter was gifted a trip and she was still invited and (as an adult) asked to pay her own way. OP has done similar things for Kate in the past. I don't see how any of this is unfair.\n\nI am an older sibling myself and sometimes my younger sibling gets things I didn't have at their age or is allowed to do things I wasn't or gets to go on a trip that I'm not part of. That's normal. I genuinely wouldn't be mad in the scenario OP describes either for the reasons I outlined above. What isn't normal though is throwing an enormous tantrum about something like this at 23.\n\nNTA in my opinion.", "This made me laugh. I reminded her multiple times. I actually told her right before I booked. She strictly chose NOT TO PAY. Probably should have made that clear. She earns $15 an hour, she doesn\u2019t pay anything, not even her phone bill.

She seems to have problems planning ahead for one. Problems going through school as well.\n\nMaybe OP should evaluate if his older daughter received all the support *she* needs to succeed in life.

Whether or not your daughter was a problem child is really irrelevant to this situation. She was *a child*. \n\nYour daughter sucks for taking it to social media and not paying when she agreed to pay, but I\u2019m inclined to believe there\u2019s more to this story based on the way you worded your post and comments alone. There is a reason your daughter feels this way. There is a reason she was exhibiting these symptoms of rebellion and attention-seeking behavior in her formative years. It\u2019s concerning to me that you\u2019d rather get judged on whether or not you\u2019re an asshole instead of getting to the bottom of why your daughter thinks you are one.

Not saying it wasn't her fault or she is innocent, but I am saying that you have to let it go at some point.

He doesn't seem to think to highly of her, but he has nothing but nice things to say about his youngest. \n\nHe's framing this as a gift for Alexa but it is a family vacation. They could come up with some sort of compromise so she doesn't feel excluded. Do you think if you weren't able to pay for a vacation your mum would just say \"you can't pay so you can't go\"? It sounds like OP just excluded her when she didn't pay without having any conversation about why she hadn't paid him yet.\n\nI am making some assumptions and with these things it's hard to get the whole picture, but I think OP handled this pretty poorly. Kate definitely isn't innocent in this situation either so I'm probably going to change my vote to ESH.", "Yes, but OP knows that she has some social problems. This won\u2019t have been the first misunderstanding between them. Yes, he technically did all he had to do, but as she is his daughter and he already knows she struggles getting things right, it would not have hurt him to sit down with her the day before buying the tickets and go over it one more time with her. \n\nI\u2019m not saying she isn\u2019t a handful of work, I\u2019m just saying that clearer communication was needed here and he is the one who seems to have the ability to make that happen. If he chooses to.", "Did Kate get the same gifts when she was 16?", "What? Not everything is a mental illness. There absolutely ARE lazy people out there who have no mental illnesses. Women included.", "Lazy is a feature of lazy people, I know it's Reddit's favourite pastime but don't go diagnosing people on the internet.", "Its incredibly frustrating when people on this sub want every character flaw to also be a diagnosed disability.", "She's not a child, she's an adult.", "and yet one child is not a problem, the problem child also lived with her mother when she was the most problematic.... so good luck with your theory", "I found the other person though thanks to you. I can\u2019t believe someone thinks it\u2019s right to cancel one kids reward cause the other is acting out though", "No its not.\n\nShitty behaviour shouldn't be punished.\n\nHowever if Kate got her shit together (sounds like she's working on it) I would say that in the future her dad should do something similar to celebrate her achievements.", "But that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening? Op is rewarding the child that is doing the good thing, and has made no indication that he would reward them unequally if the older daughter stated to achieve things as well.", "This trip is because Alexa has done well and worked hard. What did Kate go to make him proud? \n\nNo participation or \u201cwe\u2019re all winners\u201d medals here. \n\nThat\u2019s not favouritism that\u2019s Kate picking a fight because she\u2019s feeling like she\u2019s entitled to a free holiday for no effort.", "Yeah, it doesn\u2019t sound like Kate ever did anything in high school to \u201cearn\u201d anything like this", "An adult couple relationship does not equal kids, adult or adolescent. The two things have nothing to do with each other and should not be held to the same standards.", "They live together- they may just have joint finances\u2026", "As a parent, that\u2019s a pretty childish route to take.", "See my other comment, why not have another celebration involving the both of them (like a dinner) and then just have Alexa\u2019s vacation be for her. \n\nI think OP set this up in a way to confirm his bias towards Kate", "You kinda did when you told op that he was responsible for raising a blank slate. Nature and nurture are both things. My oldest is obsessed with sports. There is no one in her life that likes sports. Neither I nor her father raised a blank state that turned into a sports loving child. Different people are different. There\u2019s a certain amount a parent can do, but there\u2019s limits. And it\u2019s harder when it\u2019s a coparenting situation like ops.", "It\u2019s not a birthday present? My other example was parents that reward their children for their report cards. That doesn\u2019t happen equally when one child gets Fs and one gets As. Because they didn\u2019t achieve equally. This is her reward for hard work. Other daughter needs to also put in the work. Now in the future when the oldest daughter does hopefully achieve something, like moving out maybe or some kind of more than bare minimum effort and he refused to reward her as well I would see it differently. But if you don\u2019t put in the work you don\u2019t get the reward for doing the work. At least not for free anyways", "I feel like OP would be far more willing to compromise if Kate was acting less entitled and manipulative. I mean, she agreed to the terms of paying for the trip originally, then pretended that she thought OP was gonna pay and then took it to social media and spread lies about the family. It's not like she calmly sat OP down and discussed her financial situation with them, she went about this in a really shitty and manipulative way. If she had just said \"hey, I can't afford this trip but I'd really like to go with you guys, can I pay you back later?\", I'm pretty sure this post wouldn't have happened.\n\nBut she didn't. She went about this in the shittiest possible way, and if I was OP, I wouldn't be willing to compromise either. Especially since I'd be surprised if this kind of bevaviour was a one-off - from OPs comment, it sounds like it is a pattern.", "There\u2019s really only so much you can do for someone before you\u2019re enabling them. My personal motto is that I only help those that help themselves or the incapable. I\u2019ll do anything for a baby, if someone is trying and struggling I\u2019ll do whatever Im capable of go help them. However, if someone wants to put in zero effort but expect me to do it all for them, they\u2019re gonna get that same zero effor back.", "Hmm, no. I did buy her a brand new car when she turned 17 and took her on a daddy/daughter vacation when she graduated high school. I did buy her concert tickets though!", "It is said siblings don't have the same parents. There will be differences in the age and experience of the parents when they are born, the different experience of being an only child or only ever known older siblings and that's before you get to any nuances of undiagnosed issues or favouritism!", "Well, yes. That is sort of the point. The problem child lived with her mother. Where was dad? How much was he in her life? Maybe Kate is having a hard time seeing Alexa get all the attention she never got. We just don\u2019t know these things. \n\nIt\u2019s too easy to just assume this kid is horrible. We don\u2019t have enough facts to really know what\u2019s going on.", ">and yet one child is not a problem,\n\nOh no! I've never seen that before! How will I ever manage this spicy curveball you've thrown me?\n\nOh well... anyways...", "Yeah that\u2019s completely wild and would make no sense??? Let\u2019s have them both hate dad instead of just the one lol", "I am not an expert in parenting. I just wanted to point out that rewarding your children based on those kind of  achivements is a slippery slope kind if in my opinion because it is never fair. It cant be. Kate was going through super different things and a break up. It must not even be that serious. On if your children just may habe Trouble with the learning Environment in school and will super easy feel like a failure and wronged. However: I dont have a solution for that. But very pricy and high value rewards just makes it worse in my eyes.", "OP is saying that this is a gift for Alexa. If he is also paying for his girlfriend that's not the case. Under those circumstances I would consider this a family vacation. Paying for one family member while refusing to pay for another makes him a hypocrite regardless of what their relationship is.", "That's probably the case, but if she is getting a free vacation OP is a huge hypocrite. I just think it's shitty to exclude your daughter from a family vacation over money.", "Everyone is born a blank slate but I also stated that \"Of course, that's not the full story\". People develop likes and interests as they absorb more and more of the world.", "You've been very financially supportive, but how emotionally supportive were you when she was a troubled teen? Sometimes parents throw money while remaining emotionally disconnected to a kid who is desperately lashing, willing to take negative attention, because it's the only kind of attention they feel they can get or deserve. Her relationship with her mom is obviously strained at best, so I wondered how connected she did, or didn't, feel with her dad.", "So a dream vacation if your amazing Alexa and a concert ticket if your the \u201copposite\u201d of \u201camazing\u201d Alexa. It\u2019s not about the presents but making a difference emphasizes what you breath from every sentence in your post: You look down on Kate and think Alexa is a gift from heaven. Kate knows this and giving Alexa a vacation she never got and she isn\u2019t welcomed at (unless she pays for the ticket with a minimum wage job) only proofs her feelings that you like her more are justified. This is way more than just a flight ticket.", "You mean the child that he raised is not a monster, and the child he didnt raise   in his home is a monster.. how could I possibly deal with your return.  SO either the mother was the problem or the loss of the nuclear family is to blame.\n\nReddit always making excuses for assholes. A child can become a problem all by themselves.", "No. You do different things to a partner than to a child. You have other agreements with a partner than with a child.", "Turns out I was wrong-girlfriend is paying for herself. Some reasoning by op, girlfriend and daughter are both adults with their own personal money so they need to pay for their selves.", "You very very heavily blamed op for his saunters behavior though. By age 23 everyone i know is living an adult life in their own homes, some with their own families paying their bills being grown ass adults. Just because the older daughter seems to be stuck in the nest doesn\u2019t make her behavior ops fault. She is still an adult, and will never grow unless she takes accountable for herself.", "I agree with you. Seems like Kate didn\u2019t get enough support and attention from her parents.", "You trying so hard to make Kate seem like this black sheep when in reality she\u2019s just a shit person. She Was a spoiled, violent, disrespectful teen and as an adult she hasn\u2019t changed much. Now she\u2019s lying on the internet committing fraud to get money. She earns $15/hr, been working for 4 years, has no bills or rent to pay, like is it that hard to expect a 23y/o (who virtually has no responsibility) to have $200-$400 saved up? Yeah it\u2019s for her own crib, but my god dropping $200-$400 is not going to set her that far back. This is a reward for Alexa because she works her ass off in school, and typically good behavior gets rewarded. Kate barely finished school, was skipping, smoking, etc. and she still got a trip to freaking Tulum! How many ppl Yk gets a paid trip to Tulum even though they barely finished school? Her own mother went NC with her, She just the bad guy in all this", "Maybe Kate never ask for a dream vacation? Maybe she only ask for concert tickets, new car, new phones etc. \n\nAs OP stated Kate was a nightmare when she was a teenager. She skip school, etc. Would you reward her with that kind of behaviour?", "All arseholes were children once, at a certain point we all have to take responsibility for ourselves", "Well at least he isn't a hypocrite"]}
