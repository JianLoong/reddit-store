For starters Kate lives with me rent free and bill free. She used to live with her mother full time but her mom kicked her out at 18. I don\u2019t blame her mother though. Kate was absolutely terrible in her teenager years. She was rude, disrespectful and would steal,smoke, skip class,etc. Kate barely finished high school and was put in a continuation school. Since this though Kate is doing a lot better, she didn\u2019t want to go to college but she works at a fast food restaurant and is saving up for her own apartment. \n\nAlexa on the other hand is the opposite, she\u2019s amazing in school, works, volunteers  and still has time to do sports and clubs. I\u2019m extremely proud of her and feel as if she puts too much pressure on herself. Me and my girlfriend decided to surprise her on a vacation. Alexa has always wanted to go there and it wasn\u2019t as pricey as we expected. We planned this in early October.\n\nI told Kate about the vacation and asked if she wanted to come, but she would have to pay her own ticket.She said yes and would give me the money before Halloween. Well she never gave me the money even after being reminded, so I booked the trip November 1 for the 18-21 of November. I told my daughter this Sunday at dinner and she was very excited, Kate then said \u201c you\u2019ll have to cancel and hope they refund. I work those days.\u201d I told her she wasn\u2019t coming since she didn\u2019t pay. She was confused and thought I was paying for her. I told her that she was an adult who worked and lived  free, why would I pay. She got upset and said because I\u2019m her daughter and that I was paying for Alexa so why not her. An argument then happened which resulted in Alexa and Kate crying and Kate saying she hated me.\n\n Kate has been ignoring us until we apologize and pay her ticket, which I won\u2019t. Well yesterday Alexa sent me a link to a video on tick Tock where it shows Kate crying and explaining the situation, but she lied about a lot of things in the videos and made Alexa and I look like bad guys. The video got a lot of attention and support. She even opened up a go fund me where she received close to 500 dollars. I showed my girlfriend and we were both livid, Alexa was also very upset about the comments which fueled my anger. When she came home a huge argument broke out and I basically kicked her out for the week. \n\nShe\u2019s been posting on social media platforms talking about me, my daughter and girlfriend. My daughter even got some nasty messages on her social media. My girlfriend told me I\u2019m right on this but my daughter told me to just pay for her ticket.

Rather, you should treat them equitably. \n\nEquality means each daughter is given the same resources or opportunities, without taking into account the individual needs of each daughter. Equity recognises that each daughter has different circumstances and allocates the exact resources and opportunities needed to reach an equal outcome.\n\n[This](https://static.diffen.com/uploadz/3/37/Equality-equity-justice-lores.png) picture concisely illustrates the difference.\n\n**Reminder of the rewards of perseverance and skill**\n\nI presume that your goal is to teach your daughters the importance of hard work.\n\nAlexa has *earned* the holiday. She has put in the work to pursue her ambitions, and manifest her dreams into fruition. So you're rewarding her discipline with a holiday, to further entrench the value of a strong worth ethic. \n\nKate, on the other hand, despite being the older sister, has yet to demonstrate her understanding of the importance of discipline. Maybe you can reward her with a holiday once she has achieved what she has set out to accomplish (i.e. purchasing her apartment).\n\n**The carrot, and the stick**\n\nSome children thrive chasing a dangled carrot, while others need to be chased with a stick. Given how entitled, manipulative, and ungrateful Kate is behaving, maybe what Kate needs in this stage of her life is some tough love. \n\n**Reasons for judgment**\n\nThe circumstances that led you to rewarding Alexa with a holiday does not exist with Kate. She hasn't done what Alexa has, and therefore should not be awarded as Alexa is.\n\nOn the contrary, putting aside her past, Kate has responded to this situation by:\n\n* failing to come up with the money for her ticket by Halloween as previously agreed;\n* being self-centred enough to impose her individual schedule on everyone else;\n* manufacturing a falsified version of events, and publishing it online to defame you; and\n* using deception to manipulate donors into contributing to her holiday fund.\n\nAmidst all of that is a 23 year old adult who still lives at home, and does not pay rent. \n\nWhat exactly has Kate done that is worthy of a reward?", "NTA-, but I thought she had to work that weekend anyway.", "NTA for this situation......but....\n\nIm sorry..she's 23 not 13.

She needs a major dose of reality that you failed to deliver when she was in her actual teen years.\n\nY--ta for failing her as a parent and continuing to do so....\n\nHowever  you're not the ahole in this situation which is what you came on here to be judged for.

She should've taken this as a learning experience. \n\nThat said, if she's not yet in therapy, she should be. Whatever caused her to act out in the first place is still there. It would be kind for you to pay for that if you live in the US, since I doubt her insurance (if she even has it) would cover that.", "NTA.  Kate is being ungrateful about the fact that you've allowed her to live rent free in your house all these years. She's being manipulative and telling lies.

Mentioning about how Kate was \"absolutely terrible\" as a child even though you admit she's doing way better now, while you're \"extremely proud\" of Alexa when that's not really relevant to the story is a pretty big tell. I'd be pretty upset too if I felt like my parents were totally favoring my younger sibling.\n\nAlso, while sure, 23 is an adult, it's hardly some unusual event for a 23 year old to still be living at home while they save up for their own place. It's nice that you're letting her live there rent-free, but she's not some random tenant, she's a part of your family, and probably (and I would say rightfully) feels incredibly hurt that you're all going on vacation without her.\n\nYou're obviously within your rights to say she has to pay her own way, and her reaction is immature, but you might want to look in the mirror a little bit as to why her reaction is what it is.", "ESH. With Kate, she is being manipulative enough said  as other comments have gone into better description. \n\nAnd with you, OP these behaviours don\u2019t just appear out of the woodworks. It\u2019s hard for me not to see this as favouritism. And telling her she needs to pay isn\u2019t clear beyond stating an expectation. Does she have much financial literacy? To juggle saving for her own place and to save of trip, that seems like a lot. \n\nWith you, have you been to family therapy? I highly suggest you do.

If Alexa is saying you should pay for Kate, then Alexa is not little miss perfect you make her out to be...especially if she is causing drama over it.  You and your girlfriend decide to surprise the \"good\" daughter with a vacation.  OK, nothing wrong with that, at first glance.  However, did anybody ever do the same for Kate?  I'm not talking about since she turned 18.  I'm talking about, ever...at any time in her life?\n\nIf the youngest child gets a free vacation on dad, but the older child never got a free vacation from anybody, then that...sucks for the older child.

Sorry.", "YTA. You sound like a really awful and manipulative father. Alexa probably \u201cputs too much pressure\u201d on herself because she watched you and their mother treat Kate like shit.

So, she misunderstood who was paying and you just silently booked the tickets without any word to her? No, \"Hey I'm booking the vacation Sunday. How are you on saving up your money?\" That's sneaky and quite frankly sounds calculating. 2. You are celebrating one kid by leaving out another. You don't choose travel as a family activity unless you really don't want the family member making sh*t wages at a fast food restaurant to attend. Again, calculating and sneaky. 3.

One of the first unwritten rules of parenting is you never show favoritism\u2014 unless you want it to come around and bite you in the ass later in life.\n\nSure, she\u2019s an adult. Sure, she lives rent-free, and allegedly has no bills (I don\u2019t buy that assessment, though). But who set up that system in the first place? You, or her? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s reasonable to come back later and upend the expectations and understanding of a system you yourself had a hand in creating. \n\nThat being said, teaching your child a sense of responsibility, particularly when it comes to finances, is important. But the way you went about it, by leaving to fester what clearly seemed to be a misunderstanding on her part in regards to your travel arrangement/offer, until nearly the date of travel, rather than making sure she understood that she has to pay for it LONG BEFORE it was nearly time to tell Alexa, especially when she began to give any suspicions that she wasn\u2019t going to give you any payments, might not have been the best course of action if the goal was to have her along, yet still help make her accountable for her own travel arrangements.\n\nI note at the beginning of your post you state, \u201cKATE (emphasis added) was absolutely terrible in her teenage years\u2026\u201d Stop right there. \n\nDid you ever stop to think \u201cwhy\u201d she was so \u201cterrible?\u201d When children of any age in their formative years exhibit destructive behaviors, including substance abuse, an adverse change in the type of friends with whom they associate, stealing to support a habit, and certainly skipping class, it\u2019s usually a manifestation of the inner turmoil or complex emotions they do not know how to process on their own, particularly in cases of traumatic elements of their environments. From the sound of it, since \u201cshe used to live with her mother,\u201d perhaps she acted out during high school because she was dealing with your separation with her mom (assuming you are her biological parent), or perhaps she was being bullied at school and felt she had no one to turn to, or perhaps she felt neither of her parents loved her enough to stay together (I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s factually the case, but those are certainly common feelings teenagers dealing with the emotional instability a divorce can cause).\n\nKids are not born as \u201cproblem children;\u201d They learn it from their environments, and it\u2019s easy to pin it all on them, but if a parent does not fully investigate the roots of these destructive behaviors, and make good faith efforts to address, if not remedy them, then the parent is jointly liable, in my mind, for those self-same behaviors. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.\n\nI think a better approach would have been to have her sign a contract, detailing the schedule and expectations of payments, since in its basic form, that\u2019s what your arrangement was (e.g. the \u2018offer\u2019 of her getting to go on vacation with you, if she provides the \u2018consideration,\u2019 in the form of monetary installment payments). Though it might seem excessive to some, having seen many of these types of familial misunderstandings and disagreements, if it\u2019s all spelled out in writing, and she agrees to the terms via her signature, any misunderstandings can be quickly remedied by referring her to what she signed, negating feelings of her need to trash talk her family and seek help on Go Fund Me\u2026 even if you secretly have no intent to enforce the contract.\n\n(Incidentally, unless she misrepresented a material fact with the intent of deceiving those donating money to her cause, she technically may not have defrauded anyone, depending on what she actually said in her posts\u2026 none of us know, as we weren\u2019t privy to them\u2026and, of course, your state\u2019s fraud laws; so filing charges against her or referring her case to the District Attorney probably wouldn\u2019t be the best option, if you\u2019re just trying to teach her responsibility/accountability.)\n\nBut ultimately, the vacation is/was supposed to be about Alexa, and if she is close enough with Kate that she wanted her to come, it might have been a good idea just to foot the bill for Alexa\u2019s sake, and work out the details with Kate after the trip\u2026 even if you never see a dime in repayment. \n\n(My personal belief/approach is that when it comes to friends and family, any lent money, or negotiations are just gifts to them in my mind, meaning I don\u2019t expect it back\u2026 but obviously, if they take advantage of my generosity or kindness, I just don\u2019t get involved with them financially going forward).\n\nSorry, I have a bad habit of turning these posts into essays, so my apologies lol.\n\nBecause of the format of this forum, I unfortunately have to opine you are the asshole in this case. Though, I personally think the two of you probably just don\u2019t relate to each other on some level, so you two exhibit your frustrations with each other in conflicting ways\u2014 hers probably being a little more extreme, due to her (as I like to say) \u201cyouthful indiscretions.\u201d\n\nI hope Alexa had a great time, and things work out between you and Kate.

Anyways, I got medication for it and have been using it. I do what my parents ask whenever they ask, help them out whenever they need it, cook once a week for everyone etc. I'm not exactly a copy of Kate, but something similar does happen to me.\n\nBack to that gacha game; my dad has been warning me about spending money on that game. Because it's halting my savings, he wants me to stop spending on it entirely. Since I enjoy it so much, I ignored it, and he kept telling me about it. It's not an unhealthy amount and I don't take stuff out of my savings for it, but it still bothers him. Because of this, he told me to pay for the medicine myself as well as the majority of groceries I ask for for my mom to pick up when she does them. (I go myself on Saturdays but she goes to different stores than I do which have different things I need). I agreed because its only normal. I paid for it all, I'm not bothered by it.\n\nRecently they've also been talking about going to a trip to Indonesia and have everything planned out except when the trip will be. They asked me to come for free. I checked it out and because its such a hectic schedule, I told them it would be bad because I'd grow extremely tired. Note that Indonesia is our country of origin so it holds significant meaning to us. My mom offered a different vacation and gave Disney land Paris as option. I refused because I'm more into rollercoasters than she is and its still too expensive. She offered to pay for it, but since I have a full time job now I want to pitch in. If I wanted to go to Indonesia, I would have paid most of my ticket. If I wanted to go to Disney land Paris, I would have paid most of my ticket.\n\nI'm not the best daughter in the world.

Why I told you my stories is because I do think I'm sensible and compared it to Kate.

Sometimes it's simply what you have at the time to offer and not disparity or victimizing or anything more than simply - 7 years is a pretty big gap and circumstances CHANGE.

They should be able to stomp on you and you should love and hug them and give in or your a horrible parent and made them that way!\" is disgusting. If there was no DNA involved, it would be cut and dry. As an adult - you should be mature enough to treat your family BETTER than your internet sympathy donator's.

Kate's reaction is likely because she has felt \"less than\" her younger sister. You paying for one daughter's trip but not the other daughter is, frankly, always going to come off to Kate badly. \n\nYes, I understand that she is an official adult who you let live in your home rent free, and while that is kind of you, it was a choice you made. You shouldn't have agreed to it if it meant you would hold it over her head. \n\nPlus, did you pay for Kate to go on a trip when she was 16. No? Because she wasn't your perfect child. Yes, was Kate a troubled teen? sure, but troubled teens deserve love and attention from their parents too. For example, you could have taken her on a vacation when she finished continuing school to celebrate. \n\nRegardless, my point being that her age does not matter to her in this situation. All she is seeing and feeling is you picking or \"favoring\" one daughter over another, so of course that is going to suck and it's going to hurt. In your shoes, I would have planned better with Kate. Perhaps you could have agreed to pay half of the trip for her and she'd have to pay the other half. Or maybe you could have just sat her down and explained everything, really explained because, like I said, she is absolutely going to feel unwanted by you. It's just the nature of the situation no matter how \"fair\" you think you are being. Plus, being the only family member not going on a family trip, also sucks. \n\nThat said, Kate is a giant asshole for the way she handled it.

All family goes or we dont, we are a family. We are together. Theres no black sheep here. And you dont get excluded over skipping school and teenage nonsense. There are other more appropriate punishments.\n\nThis is doing nothing but building resentment between all of you and it will also put resentment between the sisters. You are pitting the eldest against the youngest by your actions. \n\nThe eldest needed therapy and help in high school... did you get her that? What support did you offer her? \nAnd kicking a child out, 18 or not, is a great way to destroy whatever confidence and stability she had left. Her mother broke her trust and clearly had no parenting skills.  \nYou all divorced...when was that exactly? \n\nSo far, you all suck as parents to the oldest child. \n\nThen comes the youngest, and probably learning from her sisters mistakes, chose  a different path. Now she gets showered with affection, praise, and vacations. \n\nYou should be proud of the eldest too. She has turned things around, and is working what is probably a dead end job. Her mountain is much higher to climb but she has been trying.  Did you ever get her that therapy? Sounds like she still needs it. \nAnd where were you when she lived with her mother? Was mom the only one making decision? Because she made bad ones.\n\nThe eldest deserves praise too, I think you've just mentally cast her aside and decided she wasn't worthy of this trip. Total black sheep vibes. \n\nI didn't see that she was arrested, had a baby, did so many drugs she went to rehab.  You said steal, smoke and skip class.  Ok, and?!?! You described like half of my graduating class. \n\nI think you need to get into a counseling and learn how to bring a family together instead of splitting them up. \n\nYTA", "I like tough love but this was savage.

What happened in Kate\u2019s life that made her that way? Was it the divorce? Other parenting issues? Because she\u2019s several years older than her sister, she may have been deeply impacted whereas her sister may have been young enough to cope more easily. If not that, was there anything else that she went through? The reason I bring this up is because if you\u2019re paying one siblings way it can be hurtful to the other sibling who never got that. And maybe she didn\u2019t ever deserve a vacation when she was younger, but maybe she experienced things that negatively impacted her to cause her to behave differently. Teens do not just act out for no reason. And comparing yourself to your siblings sucks and makes you feel unloved. \n\nOP I get that on the surface it all makes sense but I just wonder if there\u2019s more depth to this.

She might not notice it directly, but she certainly feels she is being treated unfairly. Just like you, she seeks for validation of her behavior online.\n\nDo yourself a favor and split this situation up into two parts: the trip and your decision not to pay for her, and her online campaign to badmouth you.\n\nAs for the first, you're completely in your rights to make her pay for it, but that neither empathizes with her situation, or improves her situation. Why does she expect you to pay for it? You'll have to ask yourself if this is a hill you want to die on, because it _will_ damage your relationship with your daughter. If this _is_ a hill you want to die on, you should ask yourself why. In that case there is more going on than just this, and perhaps you should talk to Kate about this.\n\nAs for the second part, she is clearly and obviously wrong to air your dirty laundry online. She should be made aware of the harassment that ensues, and take responsibility for it. This would be a more appropriate hill to die on, because that kind of response to a setback within a familial relationship is unacceptable.", "NTA\n\nI think it\u2019s high time that Kate starts to pay you a reasonable rent.

Perhaps she is mature enough now that she can control impulsive behavior better, but not mature enough yet to consistently make the more mature decisions. People who have emotional disabilities or traumas can be emotionally developmentally stunted until they receive proper treatment. So she may be an adult, but act like a teenager because her mental health was not properly addressed. \n\n\nSet her up for success by helping her get treatment now.

Emotionally immature parents create emotionally immature children/adults.", "I purposely go out of my way to avoid this song as it remains \u2018stuck\u2019 in my head for literal weeks on a loop. Never would I have expected to find it here, thanks. *eye twitch* \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "I'm thinking Alexa puts pressure on herself for a reason, she's seen what will happen to her if she slips up and stops being the perfect daughter.", "Thought this reply was in reference to the three comments I've made about the Pina Colada song in the last week. You can have that one instead?"]}
