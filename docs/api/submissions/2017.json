For starters Kate lives with me rent free and bill free. She used to live with her mother full time but her mom kicked her out at 18. I don\u2019t blame her mother though. Kate was absolutely terrible in her teenager years. She was rude, disrespectful and would steal,smoke, skip class,etc. Kate barely finished high school and was put in a continuation school. Since this though Kate is doing a lot better, she didn\u2019t want to go to college but she works at a fast food restaurant and is saving up for her own apartment. \n\nAlexa on the other hand is the opposite, she\u2019s amazing in school, works, volunteers  and still has time to do sports and clubs. I\u2019m extremely proud of her and feel as if she puts too much pressure on herself. Me and my girlfriend decided to surprise her on a vacation. Alexa has always wanted to go there and it wasn\u2019t as pricey as we expected. We planned this in early October.\n\nI told Kate about the vacation and asked if she wanted to come, but she would have to pay her own ticket.She said yes and would give me the money before Halloween. Well she never gave me the money even after being reminded, so I booked the trip November 1 for the 18-21 of November. I told my daughter this Sunday at dinner and she was very excited, Kate then said \u201c you\u2019ll have to cancel and hope they refund. I work those days.\u201d I told her she wasn\u2019t coming since she didn\u2019t pay. She was confused and thought I was paying for her. I told her that she was an adult who worked and lived  free, why would I pay. She got upset and said because I\u2019m her daughter and that I was paying for Alexa so why not her. An argument then happened which resulted in Alexa and Kate crying and Kate saying she hated me.\n\n Kate has been ignoring us until we apologize and pay her ticket, which I won\u2019t. Well yesterday Alexa sent me a link to a video on tick Tock where it shows Kate crying and explaining the situation, but she lied about a lot of things in the videos and made Alexa and I look like bad guys. The video got a lot of attention and support. She even opened up a go fund me where she received close to 500 dollars. I showed my girlfriend and we were both livid, Alexa was also very upset about the comments which fueled my anger. When she came home a huge argument broke out and I basically kicked her out for the week. \n\nShe\u2019s been posting on social media platforms talking about me, my daughter and girlfriend. My daughter even got some nasty messages on her social media. My girlfriend told me I\u2019m right on this but my daughter told me to just pay for her ticket.

Rather, you should treat them equitably. \n\nEquality means each daughter is given the same resources or opportunities, without taking into account the individual needs of each daughter. Equity recognises that each daughter has different circumstances and allocates the exact resources and opportunities needed to reach an equal outcome.\n\n[This](https://static.diffen.com/uploadz/3/37/Equality-equity-justice-lores.png) picture concisely illustrates the difference.\n\n**Reminder of the rewards of perseverance and skill**\n\nI presume that your goal is to teach your daughters the importance of hard work.\n\nAlexa has *earned* the holiday. She has put in the work to pursue her ambitions, and manifest her dreams into fruition. So you're rewarding her discipline with a holiday, to further entrench the value of a strong worth ethic. \n\nKate, on the other hand, despite being the older sister, has yet to demonstrate her understanding of the importance of discipline. Maybe you can reward her with a holiday once she has achieved what she has set out to accomplish (i.e. purchasing her apartment).\n\n**The carrot, and the stick**\n\nSome children thrive chasing a dangled carrot, while others need to be chased with a stick. Given how entitled, manipulative, and ungrateful Kate is behaving, maybe what Kate needs in this stage of her life is some tough love. \n\n**Reasons for judgment**\n\nThe circumstances that led you to rewarding Alexa with a holiday does not exist with Kate. She hasn't done what Alexa has, and therefore should not be awarded as Alexa is.\n\nOn the contrary, putting aside her past, Kate has responded to this situation by:\n\n* failing to come up with the money for her ticket by Halloween as previously agreed;\n* being self-centred enough to impose her individual schedule on everyone else;\n* manufacturing a falsified version of events, and publishing it online to defame you; and\n* using deception to manipulate donors into contributing to her holiday fund.\n\nAmidst all of that is a 23 year old adult who still lives at home, and does not pay rent. \n\nWhat exactly has Kate done that is worthy of a reward?", "NTA-, but I thought she had to work that weekend anyway.", "NTA for this situation......but....\n\nIm sorry..she's 23 not 13. At some point she needs to grow the fuck up and move on. She wants to live and keep acting like a hurt 13 year old. Fighting online and lying to get money on a GoFundMe?!? .... Don't let her back home. She needs a major dose of reality that you failed to deliver when she was in her actual teen years.\n\nY--ta for failing her as a parent and continuing to do so....\n\nHowever  you're not the ahole in this situation which is what you came on here to be judged for.

You already messed up once...don't commit the same mistake again.", "I see how you write 'my daughter' when you talk about Alexa and 'Kate' when you talk about Kate.

She should've taken this as a learning experience. \n\nThat said, if she's not yet in therapy, she should be. Whatever caused her to act out in the first place is still there. It would be kind for you to pay for that if you live in the US, since I doubt her insurance (if she ever has it) would cover that.", "NTA.  Kate is being ungrateful about the fact that you've allowed her to live rent free in your house all these years. She's being manipulative and telling lies.

I get that you wanna teach the eldest about responsibility and that the youngest deserves a break. What I don't understand is the favoritism towards the youngest.

Kate\u2019s surprise also makes me suspect you didn\u2019t communicate clearly about your expectations.\n\nHow Kate responded is wrong but I can understand how she\u2019d feel hurt by her father\u2019s very open disappointment in her.", "Kinda think this is ESH. Her reaction is pretty bad, but it kinda seems like you're stacking the deck against her for past behavior a bit when they're both your daughters. Mentioning about how Kate was \"absolutely terrible\" as a child even though you admit she's doing way better now, while you're \"extremely proud\" of Alexa when that's not really relevant to the story is a pretty big tell. I'd be pretty upset too if I felt like my parents were totally favoring my younger sibling.\n\nAlso, while sure, 23 is an adult, it's hardly some unusual event for a 23 year old to still be living at home while they save up for their own place. It's nice that you're letting her live there rent-free, but she's not some random tenant, she's a part of your family, and probably (and I would say rightfully) feels incredibly hurt that you're all going on vacation without her.\n\nYou're obviously within your rights to say she has to pay her own way, and her reaction is immature, but you might want to look in the mirror a little bit as to why her reaction is what it is.", "ESH. With Kate, she is being manipulative enough said  as other comments have gone into better description. \n\nAnd with you, OP these behaviours don\u2019t just appear out of the woodworks. It\u2019s hard for me not to see this as favouritism. And telling her she needs to pay isn\u2019t clear beyond stating an expectation. Does she have much financial literacy? To juggle saving for her own place and to save of trip, that seems like a lot. \n\nWith you, have you been to family therapy? I highly suggest you do. Your one daughter is more set up for life then the other and I wonder why that is and what you have contributed to this dynamic.

If Alexa is saying you should pay for Kate, then Alexa is not little miss perfect you make her out to be...especially if she is causing drama over it.  You and your girlfriend decide to surprise the \"good\" daughter with a vacation.  OK, nothing wrong with that, at first glance.  However, did anybody ever do the same for Kate?  I'm not talking about since she turned 18.  I'm talking about, ever...at any time in her life?\n\nIf the youngest child gets a free vacation on dad, but the older child never got a free vacation from anybody, then that...sucks for the older child.

Just because one is doing well in academics doesn't mean that she is more deserving than the one who didn't. Both of your daughters sound like people to be proud of.\n\nI don't know what caused the trouble for Kate when she was a teenager, but I do know that getting kicked out by her mother had to have been pretty painful.

If Alexa had a birthday or graduation or something special coming to her, then at least I could appreciate why you think Kate should pay to go too?\n\nI can't really make sense of this? Sorry.", "YTA. You sound like a really awful and manipulative father. Alexa probably \u201cputs too much pressure\u201d on herself because she watched you and their mother treat Kate like shit.

In all seriousness, consider refunding your tickets and use that money for family therapy. I feel for both of your kids.", "Your playing favorites with your daughters. It's completely unfair to pay for one daughters vacation while ignoring the other one.

So, she misunderstood who was paying and you just silently booked the tickets without any word to her? No, \"Hey I'm booking the vacation Sunday. How are you on saving up your money?\" That's sneaky and quite frankly sounds calculating. 2. You are celebrating one kid by leaving out another. You don't choose travel as a family activity unless you really don't want the family member making sh*t wages at a fast food restaurant to attend. Again, calculating and sneaky. 3. When you behave poorly, as you have, you don't get to get angry at the other persons narrative.

One of the first unwritten rules of parenting is you never show favoritism\u2014 unless you want it to come around and bite you in the ass later in life.\n\nSure, she\u2019s an adult. Sure, she lives rent-free, and allegedly has no bills (I don\u2019t buy that assessment, though). But who set up that system in the first place? You, or her? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s reasonable to come back later and upend the expectations and understanding of a system you yourself had a hand in creating. \n\nThat being said, teaching your child a sense of responsibility, particularly when it comes to finances, is important. But the way you went about it, by leaving to fester what clearly seemed to be a misunderstanding on her part in regards to your travel arrangement/offer, until nearly the date of travel, rather than making sure she understood that she has to pay for it LONG BEFORE it was nearly time to tell Alexa, especially when she began to give any suspicions that she wasn\u2019t going to give you any payments, might not have been the best course of action if the goal was to have her along, yet still help make her accountable for her own travel arrangements.\n\nI note at the beginning of your post you state, \u201cKATE (emphasis added) was absolutely terrible in her teenage years\u2026\u201d Stop right there. \n\nDid you ever stop to think \u201cwhy\u201d she was so \u201cterrible?\u201d When children of any age in their formative years exhibit destructive behaviors, including substance abuse, an adverse change in the type of friends with whom they associate, stealing to support a habit, and certainly skipping class, it\u2019s usually a manifestation of the inner turmoil or complex emotions they do not know how to process on their own, particularly in cases of traumatic elements of their environments. From the sound of it, since \u201cshe used to live with her mother,\u201d perhaps she acted out during high school because she was dealing with your separation with her mom (assuming you are her biological parent), or perhaps she was being bullied at school and felt she had no one to turn to, or perhaps she felt neither of her parents loved her enough to stay together (I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s factually the case, but those are certainly common feelings teenagers dealing with the emotional instability a divorce can cause).\n\nKids are not born as \u201cproblem children;\u201d They learn it from their environments, and it\u2019s easy to pin it all on them, but if a parent does not fully investigate the roots of these destructive behaviors, and make good faith efforts to address, if not remedy them, then the parent is jointly liable, in my mind, for those self-same behaviors. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.\n\nI think a better approach would have been to have her sign a contract, detailing the schedule and expectations of payments, since in its basic form, that\u2019s what your arrangement was (e.g. the \u2018offer\u2019 of her getting to go on vacation with you, if she provides the \u2018consideration,\u2019 in the form of monetary installment payments). Though it might seem excessive to some, having seen many of these types of familial misunderstandings and disagreements, if it\u2019s all spelled out in writing, and she agrees to the terms via her signature, any misunderstandings can be quickly remedied by referring her to what she signed, negating feelings of her need to trash talk her family and seek help on Go Fund Me\u2026 even if you secretly have no intent to enforce the contract.\n\n(Incidentally, unless she misrepresented a material fact with the intent of deceiving those donating money to her cause, she technically may not have defrauded anyone, depending on what she actually said in her posts\u2026 none of us know, as we weren\u2019t privy to them\u2026and, of course, your state\u2019s fraud laws; so filing charges against her or referring her case to the District Attorney probably wouldn\u2019t be the best option, if you\u2019re just trying to teach her responsibility/accountability.)\n\nBut ultimately, the vacation is/was supposed to be about Alexa, and if she is close enough with Kate that she wanted her to come, it might have been a good idea just to foot the bill for Alexa\u2019s sake, and work out the details with Kate after the trip\u2026 even if you never see a dime in repayment. \n\n(My personal belief/approach is that when it comes to friends and family, any lent money, or negotiations are just gifts to them in my mind, meaning I don\u2019t expect it back\u2026 but obviously, if they take advantage of my generosity or kindness, I just don\u2019t get involved with them financially going forward).\n\nSorry, I have a bad habit of turning these posts into essays, so my apologies lol.\n\nBecause of the format of this forum, I unfortunately have to opine you are the asshole in this case. Though, I personally think the two of you probably just don\u2019t relate to each other on some level, so you two exhibit your frustrations with each other in conflicting ways\u2014 hers probably being a little more extreme, due to her (as I like to say) \u201cyouthful indiscretions.\u201d\n\nI hope Alexa had a great time, and things work out between you and Kate.

Anyways, I got medication for it and have been using it. I do what my parents ask whenever they ask, help them out whenever they need it, cook once a week for everyone etc. I'm not exactly a copy of Kate, but something similar does happen to me.\n\nBack to that gacha game; my dad has been warning me about spending money on that game. Because it's halting my savings, he wants me to stop spending on it entirely. Since I enjoy it so much, I ignored it, and he kept telling me about it. It's not an unhealthy amount and I don't take stuff out of my savings for it, but it still bothers him. Because of this, he told me to pay for the medicine myself as well as the majority of groceries I ask for for my mom to pick up when she does them. (I go myself on Saturdays but she goes to different stores than I do which have different things I need). I agreed because its only normal. I paid for it all, I'm not bothered by it.\n\nRecently they've also been talking about going to a trip to Indonesia and have everything planned out except when the trip will be. They asked me to come for free. I checked it out and because its such a hectic schedule, I told them it would be bad because I'd grow extremely tired. Note that Indonesia is our country of origin so it holds significant meaning to us. My mom offered a different vacation and gave Disney land Paris as option. I refused because I'm more into rollercoasters than she is and its still too expensive. She offered to pay for it, but since I have a full time job now I want to pitch in. If I wanted to go to Indonesia, I would have paid most of my ticket. If I wanted to go to Disney land Paris, I would have paid most of my ticket.\n\nI'm not the best daughter in the world.

Sometimes it's simply what you have at the time to offer and not disparity or victimizing or anything more than simply - 7 years is a pretty big gap and circumstances CHANGE.

Their youngest is clearly the oldest mentally.", "Given the price of rent, in many places a single income from fast food work isn't enough for an apartment even in a bad neighborhood.\n\nAlso whether their is public transit.  I was able to afford rent on a pretty shitty salary by taking the bus to work and not owning a car.  \n\nI don't know anyone that works fast food that doesn't live with their parents or a spouse.  I know thats anecdotal, but still.", "Do you know how hard it can be to rent? First you\u2019ve got to find somewhere in budget, then check it\u2019s actually inhabitable (and depending on budget, good luck with finding one that is\u2026), then you\u2019ve got to pay a deposit, usually a month\u2019s rent, you might need references and/or a guarantor (which it sounds like neither of the parents are willing to do), then you\u2019ve probably got to get a credit check, then you\u2019ve got to sign contracts, then you\u2019ve got to wait until you can actually move in. That\u2019s gonna take *at least* a week, but likely longer given Kate works in fast food so she probably doesn\u2019t have a huge budget to work with.  It\u2019s not like you can just waltz in to an agency and say \u201chello I\u2019d like a house please\u201d and be sorted within the hour. As for moving in with her mum, do you mean the ones that\u2019s already kicked her out once? What are the chances that her mum lets her stay, and if she will, what are the chances Kate wants to? I wouldn\u2019t want to go back to a parent that had already demonstrated how little they care. \n\nHow is it a punishment? Maybe because they\u2019ve had an argument, and OP has decided that his solution is to tell his daughter - who lives with him - that she\u2019s no longer welcome in his house. That sounds like a punishment to me. It\u2019s not \u201cstopping her free ride\u201d, OP could do that by asking her to pay a few hundred a month in rent, or for her own food. But instead he\u2019s decided to kick her out, because for some reason Americans seem to think that\u2019s a sane and normal approach to one\u2019s family.", "Because she is thrown out without notice. So of course she'll be homeless. Do you know how much it takes to find an affordable appartement? Let alone on fast food server wage. And it's even harder to so when you don't have place to sleep and clean yourself.", "No it's not ok", "Still kind of a dick move.", "She\u2019ll be homeless for *at least* a week while she sorts out somewhere to live. What the fuck is she meant to do during that time. \n\nIn my opinion, any parent that voluntarily makes their child homeless is both a bad parent and a bad person, end of.", "kicking someone on such short notice seem cruel considering there is many people who work full time and still can't afford housing in America", "So, what I'm wondering about is this. OP mentions that Kate was a difficult teenager, and it seems like he and Kate's mom are no longer together. How well did Kate handle them splitting up/getting a divorce, and how well did they handle it?", "There\u2019s a difference between properly evicting someone as consequences of their actions, and making someone immediately homeless for a week as a way to shock them into line. This very much looks like the latter, which is cruel and heavy-handed. And I agree with a comment that suggests the younger daughter\u2019s angelic ways may be partly because she sees how things go for the sister that acts up. Parenting by causing fear of homelessness is terrible.\n\nMeanwhile originally OP should have told Kate separately that he was going ahead and booking the trip without her, not just talking about it in front of her as if she didn\u2019t exist.", "And the minimum wage in other places is still 7something.", "Then read the post, I don\u2019t understand how you can comment on sth without reading it??", "I know right? Her first reaction was \u201cope, gotta cancel that because I can\u2019t go\u201d", "If one child is so much older, and a divorce occurred, and we don't know what reason caused the divorce (did someone cheat, was there abuse), and Alexis didn't experience the split in the same way, you *simply can not compare these two.*", "How about reward Kate for getting through her bad years and getting a job?", "The fact that she is turning her life around with a job and saving up money to move out is something to be proud of imo.", "He\u2019s acting like a fair parent. if he was really holding resentment towards his daughter, she wouldn\u2019t be living there rent free. Also this is a snapshot of their lives, it\u2019s unfair to say that he\u2019s favouring one child. On top of that she threw her family under the bus, and because of her videos her minor sister is getting insulted online and that\u2019s not okay.", "*is just a yellow lemon tree*", "*is just another whiny brat*", "This is true. Though the specific laws vary, generally you can't legally just kick someone out, unless it's a dangerous situation and the police are involved, basically warranting arrest. \n\nThe person doesn't need to pay rent either, for it to be the case. If you live in a place and can prove permanent residence, you're legally entitled to receive notice of eviction, first. Even if you're an adult child living in your parents' home. It's a legal right.", "It's all dependant on the city they live in.  Plus, the landlord also lives in the home and the ADULT is harassing and causing harm to the minor child online.  Pretty good grounds to file a restraining order, which will remove the adult child from the home immediately and legally.  \n\nOlder daughter doesn't want to be homeless,  she had better learn to not bite the hand that feeds her, literally.  Her stupid little scam for a free vacation got her an amazing prize.", ">if the parents had done their jobs properly they wouldn\u2019t be in this situation to start with\n\nWell how did the 16 year old turn out so different. Sometimes people just suck and are born with entitlement.", "I'm with you. The fact that Kate is rude and disrespectful is likely tied to the fact she grew up in toxic household. Her parents didn't divorce because they were getting along well.  \n\nThat she was kicked out of a house for a week during an argument sounds like the family acts from emotions rather than sense.   \n\nKate bears some responsibility now that she is an adult. But her parents also bear it as well.", "I know how to rent an apartment, like the majority of adults of her age.\n\n What you described is renting a decent apartment in a decent area from a decent agency. If she can't afford it - too bad.\nAs I told, the are low income areas, slumlords, there are \"roommate search\" ads, boarding houses, hostels, her friends who can rent her a room. No one will ask her for a credit check, deposit or grantors there.\n\nAnd why would OP ask her for rent? He doesn't want her to live in his house and it is consequences of her actions. She is going all nuclear on him and her teen sister. She lies, disrespects, makes the living environment hostile, painting both of them as monsters online, lets her friends to harass her little sister, making a he kid cry. Wtf OP would want to put up with it and let her live in his house even with rent? And why would Kate want to live with such terrible people? Those friends who sent her sister nasty messages could take Kate in, they seem to be very caring, understanding and supporting people, right?\n\nIt is like you giving a free ride to work to your coworker everyday. And instead of thanking you or being neutral, your coworker yells, creates drama, talks shit about you and your child online, makes your child cry.\n\n Would anyone with good boundaries ask him for gas money and keep driving him, or would they tell him to find another ride?\n\nHer mom kicked her out because she doesn't want to deal with her, her dad kicked her out because he doesn't want to deal with her.. Maybe there is something she is doing to get into the situation and she needs to change how she treats people then?", "Is not the best job, but is was her decision, it was a consequence of her actions, is cruel if the daughter is trying to study, or find a decent job, or just trying to be and adult. She wasn't have good decision in her live, her dad give her a second chance, but she used and decided to hurt them by make strangers bully them on the internet. \nPoor 23 years daughter that gets kick out of the house after being the responsible of a bunch of strangers bully and saying horrible things to her teenage sister for no reason. The internet is not a so good place, there a are too many times that just because someone says they are the victims, the other part not only star to being cyber bullying, but they start to get fisical, they go to their house and even can attack them. Probably the people on the internet are telling them that they are a piece of shit for not taking her to the vacation and that they should be embarrassed and kill themselves (not joking, for strangers in the internet is so easy and common say that to other people). Poor 23 daughter that gets kick out of the house after putting in danger her family. \nThis situation is not about \"she makes a mistake and because of that were gonna punish her kicking out of the house\" is about \" because of her she's making my other daughter life a hell and putting ourselves in danger of strangers so we're gonna kick her out because she doesn't deserve that we have to pay everything for her to live this type of life\". Just because is their daughter that doesn't mean that she can live like she's a teenager for the rest of her life and expect that her parents pay everything for her. Is not being cruel, is the consequences of her actions.", "Maybe you should read the comment moron. I didn't see the tiktok I read this. Like I said nothing op has said indicates Kate defrauded anyone. If her followers decide to give her money they can do so for any reason even if it's only to spite this guy. Everyone saying report her go fund me is just being pissy. Again maybe you shouldn't comment on something you failed to read", "You don't have to assume a 23 year old of a horrible person to expect them to pay into a trip they expect to go on.", "I agree with that. It's bad parenting, or at least it can be, depending on how exactly it's handled.\n\nEspecially in cases of kids that have undiagnosed ADHD, quite common in females. They see their siblings being rewarded and they themselves try but struggle with executive function and feel worthless, eventually they stop trying to please the parents.", "I\u2019m turning my head up and down\u2026", "I\u2019d argue the parents bear the bulk of the responsibility.

She doesn't have the money for an apartment, she wasn't given any kind of warning. What if she doesn't have a friend who can take her in? Is she just supposed to sleep on the street for a week and be grateful her dad and his girlfriend let her back in?\n\nOP doesn't mention where she goes. That's very telling. \n\nAlso the way he talks about both his daughters squicks me out. 'Kate was a *rude* teen who did teen things, like be disrespectful! And skip class! And smoke!' Nowhere does OP mention that he tried to help her at that point in her life, when she was obviously struggling. No, he can't blame her mother for getting rid of that brat the moment she could because she's just so *bad*\n\nMeanwhile he uses words like 'amazing! Works and volunteers! Is in clubs! He feels she puts too much pressure on herself (probably because she saw her sister get treated like shit because she was struggling and realized that she needed to push push push in order to not be ruined) and so deserves a vacation!'\n\nI'm very disturbed by this post. Kate feeling the need to lie is a symptom of a bigger problem that started when she was in school. She needs help. Yes she's an adult who works in fast food. That doesn't mean she's fine. That doesn't mean she's not jealous of her younger sister who gets all sorts of praise while she got left behind. She got into an argument, then lied on social media and her dad's idea of a punishment is to boot her out the door with no warning and not a single mention of where she's going to go.", "*Turning, turning, turning, turning around...*", "It really does seem like Kate was struggling as a teen and may have needed help/support to assist her in working through whatever issues were fueling her behavior. \n\nI would have paid for the tickets of both daughters to go on a nice family trip and create loving memories with both my children, despite one of them being 23 and having a job in fast food industry. \n\nI also don\u2019t like the way OP discusses his two children. Yeah one may have been classically easier to raise..but they\u2019re both yours and need your love and support.", "Also notice OP refers to Alexa as My Daughter, and only refers to Kate by her name and status as a sibling, not as his child in the same loving way.", "Exactly this! I\u2019m getting strong golden child/scapegoat vibes. And what are all the other things Kate talked about in the TikTok video? She might have lied, but she might just be giving her perspective. The way OP talks about Kate in contrast to calling Alexa \u2018my daughter\u2019, I think there are blinkers on and there\u2019s a lot missing.", "My guess is her bad behaviour started during her parents separation and rather than helping her cope they punished her for misbehaving.", "She didn't get \"let behind\". Read OP's comments.", "You're talking about this adult like she's twelve.  Even twelve year olds behave better than this.  At least if she was twelve, she could be excused a bit.", "She gas money for a hotel. She works and pays no bills."]}
