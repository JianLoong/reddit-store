Which I have done for the 3+ years we have had them (even when 9 months pregnant in the summer).\n\nTonight, I came home from an urgent care appointment for myself around the time when my kids would normally all be going to bed.

There was poop on the floor of the nursery and on the floor of the room the big kids share.\n\nThe baby was crying because he was hungry. Bedtime needed to be started.

Or is this something a good partner would have done without throwing some 3 year old agreement in my face when our lives have changed significantly (a third baby) since it was made?\n\nEDITING TO ADD: I love my dogs. I work from home and take care of them all day, letting them in and out, giving good boy/girl treats, going for walks, picking up after them, getting them to their annual appointments, grooming appointments, dosing heartworm and flea medicine timely, and giving them pets/snuggles quite regularly.

He couldn\u2019t even hold and comfort your infant while you cleaned the dog poo???\n\nNTA but lady, you have a serious husband problem here. What a terrible father you\u2019ve decided to raise children with.", "Dogs and poop-doodies aside, your husband was the one home with the kids when the accidents happened. As a responsible *parent* he should have cleaned up the mess to ensure the safety and health of his children while you were gone. NTA.", "NTA - this isnt a situation where you\u2019re asking him to help with a dog he didnt want, this is about not having literal dog shit all over his kids rooms. Him leaving it there for you is disgusting and he is an AH for that.", "Wow, just wow. I came in here thinking: if you wanted the dogs, you should look after them yourself, but these are definitely different circumstances. Your husband is not very supportive, doing things just wrong, so you have to do it yourself. How does he put the kids to sleep without teeth brushing and pjs? Does he just take them into their room and close the door? Pfff, he sounds like hard work. Anyway, he could have helped out this once, so you are NTA!", "NTA. Yes in the normal course of events this would be your job but shit happens\u2026 literally. His inability to help on this issue suggests a troubling inflexibility. \n\nAlso why is blowing off basic bedtime stuff like PJs, reading and brushing teeth? That\u2019s really lame.", "NTA - but not sure why you keep having babies with a man incapable of doing his share of the work (childcare), who isn't able to support you when you are sick and nursing, and who isn't able to take one for the team - just once - while you hold the rest of it together.  \n\nHe sounds insufferable, to be honest.  I couldn't handle being partnered with someone that lazy and selfish.", "NTA why couldn't he hsndle the baby while you cleaned? He's a bit of a jerk for not helping his life partner out in a time like this.", "Nta \nYes this is something a normal partner would do. \n\nYou had a hungry baby, didn't feel well, and 2 other kids to get to bed (because for some reason he can't manage that \ud83d\ude11) \nHe could clean up after the dog.", "I think he should have taken one for the team and helped you, but with all those animals and kids, it sounds like maybe it's a little much for you guys to manage?", "NTA you cleaning up the dog poop applies as a general rule. Sick dog having an accident (or two) in the house is a completely different situation from the norm. He should have been taking care of the kids while you were gone and that includes cleaning up any sick dog messes that happen in the house. Him leaving the kids exposed to dog poop that was soaking into carpets is inexcusable. He\u2019s doubly in the wrong here because he not only left a hazard sitting on carpets, but he wouldn\u2019t clean it up while you needed to nurse the baby, which obviously isn\u2019t something that he\u2019s physically capable of doing. He agreed to having the dogs which means that sometimes in emergencies he will have to help clean up after them, especially when they get sick, and just pointing at the agreement made before you got the dogs isn\u2019t reasonable. \nAlso, why isn\u2019t he changing his fair share of diapers either? He\u2019s phoning in bedtime prep too. This is also before I get to him insisting that his wife clean up after the dogs in the yard up until delivery in heat levels that are dangerous even for people who aren\u2019t heavily pregnant. If you had to do all the yard cleanup immediately postpartum I\u2019m even more horrified than I was at first. \nWe have some pet care agreements in our house too. After our last dog passed away things were a bit hectic. The kids swore that they would take care of a new puppy and we\u2019ve held them to that, same thing with yet another dumped kitten that we took in and kept. That doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019ve held the kids to that promise constantly, no matter the circumstances. When one kid had surgery they got a break, obviously, and siblings or parents filled in while they recovered. When a child had a sinus infection they got a break from pet care while they recovered too, etc. General agreements about pet care shouldn\u2019t be treated like insurance company paperwork where the first goal is to weasel out of anything you can justify not doing. You\u2019re a family not people in a business contract and he should be helping out when there\u2019s a need, and you shouldn\u2019t even have to ask when you\u2019re sick and the baby needs you.", "NTA sometimes life has curveballs, like being sick, and a good partner would be supportive and want to help you out as a favor when that happens. You aren't asking him to permanently take over care for the dogs wtf.", "NTA\n\nWe had the same deal in my family.  I usually don\u2019t have to pick it up, but I\u2019m not going to be a jerk about it.", "NTA. Even if your husband didn\u2019t want dogs, you guys have them now and they\u2019re part of the household. If nothing else, him cleaning it up this time under these circumstances would be the loving, supportive thing to do. Everyone sleeping in your room is not a reasonable solution.", "NTA. Cleaning up the poop in this instance would be part of taking care of his children. When you made the agreement you didn\u2019t think to add a \"but what if I\u2019m sick and the dogs are sick and they poop in the nursery\" clause. As long as you\u2019re doing the poop clean up 99% of the time,then yes, cleaning the poop would have been the decent thing to do.", "NTA, obviously. I saw where you said you have occasionally helped him with his pets, he could have returned the favor. Even if you never helped him, that is a totally selfish person for not helping you out in your situation!", "NTA but you have bigger problems than a dogs dodgy tummy. \n\nYour husband is not a team player infact he is rather neglectful if after parenting for 6 years he still can't complete their bedtime routine and basic hygiene requirements like teeth brushing. \n\nWhat planet does he live on that he can't just pick up the slack when his wife is unwell? \nI feel sorry for you it sounds like you have 4 children plus 2 dogs.", "Info\n\nDo you portion out care for the kids too? If not, you two need to communicate better rules to abide by with the care of the kids. Like for real, yall stick to a rule about what he won't do concerning dogs, but nothing about what he should do to help with all the kids? You are setting yourselves up for failure here.", "NTA. This was just one exception, and the father of your children was more concerned about proving a point than about you and the kids.", "NTA it's not the dogs that are the problem here, it's your husbands absolute unwillingness to look after your children properly or help you while you're sick. It doesn't really matter that he said he'd never help with them and 'that's the deal', you're married, you have three kids, and sometimes people get sick, he should be willing to compromise occasionally, especially in extenuating circumstances", "NTA. You\u2019re sick and still doing everything? What exactly does your husband do? He skips pajamas during bedtime? that\u2019s a pretty standard part of bedtime. \n\nIf dog poop makes him ill, has he ever changed one of your children\u2019s diapers. It sounds like you have 4 children cause this guy certainly isn\u2019t an adult.", "I thought my vote would be yta but after reading definitely NTA!", "NTA and is it possible to get a picture of the good girl and good boy?", "NTA\n\nIf my partner was sick and overrun with children i would clean the dog doo doo. You guys are supposed to be a team. However it seems in general that he seriously needs to pick up the slack.", "Your husband sounds useless, you're NTA but he needs to step up with the kids.", "NTA for asking for help.\n\nHowever, you are the AH to yourself and your children for staying with someone who does not help take care of and raise HIS OWN CHILDREN.", "NTA. Doesn\u2019t sound like a very nice guy", "NTA.", "NTA. I loathe the people saying E S H. Even if you DONT think the husband is a bullshit fleshsack, what the hell did OP do wrong????", "OMG what a baby he is!  This is something that just couldn't be done since you were at Urgent Care, that took all of less than 15 minutes, he needed this hill to die on to make himself look like a petulant child?  I'm sorry but there's a reason why men aren't physically able to carry and birth children, because it's guys like this that can't handle dog poop because \"it makes him sick\" and it begs the question if he can even handle any of the children's poop.", "NTA\n\nIf your husband can take care of all his pets, then he can be competent enough to take care of his own kids properly. \n\nHe is practicing weaponized incompetence. He knows all the things the kids need at bedtime. He just chooses not to so you will take over. He is an asshole. If he took care of the kids, you would have time to pick up poop and feed the baby. \n\nI do all the care for our dogs because I want them. My husband would prefer no pets but he knows that will never happen. But when I can't do something because I'm sick or something, he helps out without complaining. Because adults take care of each other. \n\nYou have a husband problem and he doesn't respect you.", "NTA.\n\nIt's clear you're not trying to pawn this responsibility off on him regularly or anything like that. This was just a shitty situation (pun-intended) in which you needed help because it was a bad night. He cared more about making a point about not wanting the dogs than about showing up for you in that moment.\n\nI wouldn't worry too much about what a good partner would do in that situation.  A good partner would absolutely have been willing to put their personal disgust aside to help their spouse with an urgent problem instead of being petty about it, but they'd also be capable of putting their own damn kids to bed by themselves. You don't have one of those.  \n\nYou're probably going to want to set the bar much lower. Maybe just set the goal of getting him to act like a person who actually cares about you first... because anyone who did care about you would've helped you in that situation.", "Nta", "YTA - dogs are a BIG commitment and it sounds like you got the dogs when you had a 3 year old and a 1 year old. You knew specifically that he did not want them / thinks cleaning up dog poop is gross. \n\nWhy are the dogs even pooping in the house? Are they not getting walked? It sounds like you bit off more than you could chew. \n\nAlso, question, I would guess he is taking care of the pets he wanted (fish, snakes, lizards) since you did not mention - is that right?", "Nta\n\nSounds to me the problem is he's not helping out enough so you are overwhelmed. So you should ask is my husband TA for skipping time with kids (yes) not cleaning dog poo which you agreed he shouldn't do.", "NTA because of the weaponized incompetence of your husband. If he can\u2019t take care of the kids when you\u2019re busy, he can\u2019t expect you to follow through with your commitment to be the sole dog carer, because the kids\u2019 needs will sometimes take priority over picking up poop. He presumably made some implicit/explicit agreements as well, like being able to take care of his own children.", "I'd have to go with NAH. Your husband was up front with unwillingness to clean up the messes. Perhaps it is a gag reflex issue or he really just does not want to do it. I think he gets to make that call. Sure - it would be super nice if he would help out. I don't see him as obligated to. I don't think you were wrong to ask.", "ESH. He never wanted to the dogs, a sinus infection is bad but I feel like you can still clean the poop with it. That was the arrangement you guys made.\n\nHowever I feel like he should be more supportive. He should have fed the baby, get the kids to sleep properly and do the rest of the stuff. So all you had to do was clean the poop.", "YTA, you wanted the dogs.   Welcome to life with dogs.  Maybe you will actually think it through next time", "YTA I think\u2026 he didn\u2019t want the dogs and you said you would always do it.

You made the agreement, that's all that matters on that one. Choosing to have more kids doesn't change the agreement.", "ESH.  \n\nYour husband was super clear he's never dealing with dog poop.  Sucks that you had to while overwhelmed, but it's literally what you signed up for over his objections to getting the dog.  Your idea that it's \"a three year old agreement\" is trash -- dogs are a much longer than 3 year commitment and you knew that going in.  You signed up for him not dealing with dog poop from these dogs ever.\n\nThat being said, the fact that he can't get the 6 and 4 year old around for bed and skips *toothbrushing* and *pajamas* is a serious problem.  A very, very serious problem.  Both parents should be fully capable of doing bedtime, and in this instance he should've taken care of that while you handled the poop.  Have the two of you talked about bedtime routine and agreed about what it should look like?  Outside of the dogs, does he generally pull his weight?  It feels like he might not be, and that's definitely a valid thing to need him to fix.", "YTA for pressuring him into having dogs he doesn\u2019t want in the first place.", "YTA. Hand him the baby and take care of your dogs.", "ESH. You made a deal and aren't bed ridden it's a  sinus infection. Husband could have scooped the poop but that wasn't the deal.

You shouldn\u2019t have gotten dogs.", "ESH, they're your dogs, and his solution of having the kids sleep in your room sounds reasonable given the literal shitshow in their room. \n\nBut OMG, sorry your spouse picked the night you were sick (urgent-care level sinus infection; possibly he's never had this kind of whole-head-and-face pain?) and nursing a six-month-old (at 43 years old...hats off!) to stand firm on his boundaries about poop cleanup. \n\np.s. for everyone's sake, please find a way to hold him accountable for pj's and tooth-brushing.", "ESH... I was on the fence for a bit but I think you both are to blame. 1.) He sucks for not helping out his spouse. 2.) You suck because its is all good until the worst case scenario happens and then you asked for help. \n\nIMO it's kinda like when my parents got us a cat when we were younger (I have two golden retrievers now) but they made us promise to clean up after her... Etc. And one night the cat puked all over the carpet and my parents were like... Well you promised to clean up after her.\n\nSo IMO you are kinda in the same spot. Now that being said my wife has been sick and we have a 9 week old puppy so I'm doing double dog duty at the moment and I believe a spouse should help out. \n\nBut if you say it's your job then it's your job at the best and worst case scenario. So ESH", "YTA \n\nHe doesn\u2019t want to pick up after dogs! He was pretty clear.", "ESH. And just a hint: it's not about the poop. You've got marital issues.", "YTA.  You agreed when you got them that you would look after them as he didn't want them, so it's your responsibility to clean up after them.

I took full care of them. always.  He asked me about getting a horse for his daughter to enjoy when she came out to our rural hime.  I told him he was n=more than welcome to buy and care fir a horse, that  would not be involved in any part of dealing with a horse. I know nothing about horses.    We did not get a horse.

Those are life skills for healthy teeth and common practice to change out of normal day wear before bed. Proper hygiene and nighttime routine to prepare for bed.\n\nIf you are breast feeding, pump milk and place breast milk in a bottle for him to feed the baby.\n\nIf he\u2019s so adamant about not cleaning up the poop, then there\u2019s definitely other things he can do for bedtime routine while you clean the poop.\n\nThis could have been handled so much better.", "ESH. You shouldn't have got pets under this arrangement - it always sounds like a good compromise, but it never works in the long term because there are always moments like this, where the pet partner has an unexpected need for help (is ill/snowed under with work/etc.) and the non-pet partner has to choose to either cave and negate their agreement, or stand on their principles and be a bad partner.\n\nThat said, there's a second issue here, which is that your partner is not parenting properly, meaning that you are unable to split jobs and hand the kids to him whilst you take care of the dog emergency. The baby should have been fed while you were at the doctor's, not getting more and more distressed. Your husband should be able to put the kids to bed *properly* without your supervision - toothbrushing and PJs are not optional extras, and neither are books if the kids need them to go to sleep - and this time in particular, he should have got the toothbrushing and PJs sorted  before you got home, knowing that you were sick and would need to clean up the doggy accident. \n\nFurthermore, while I accept that he shouldn't have to clean up dog poop, he *should* be invested in getting his children's rooms clean enough to sleep in, rather than focused on making you experience the consequences of your actions. At bare minimum, once you'd got the majority of the muck gone, he should be able to go fetch your pet enzyme spray (I do hope you have some - amazing stuff!) and give the carpet a good saturation.\n\nThirdly, the dogs shouldn't be wandering through the kids' room and the nursery during the day when no-one's around. You've just found out why. Close the doors. Get a childlock if necessary. You don't need accidents where the kids are sleeping/playing.", "This one is hard. I would say NTA because that was a lot right there and husband should have helped in some way.

He was clear about it when you got the dogs. So I think you kind of are YTA for that tiny bit in this whole mess.\n\nHowever, your husband could have held the baby, and managed the kids, and started dinner, and all that while you cleaned that up yeah? You sound like a single parent. If you're going to be mad about something, be mad about that.

If I made that agreement with my spouse, i would not help with the dog in that instance either. But that agreement would never work.

My wife does a better job with all things kid related, (I still can manage alone when she travels), but I do most house related things like lawn care, fixing stuff, trash, recycling, and projects, building kids furniture, etc. so if he contributes meaningfully elsewhere than it might not be fair to sandwich together his shortcomings in the child care area designed to make him look bad with your story about dog poop.", "nta.

Yet keep in mind that if you want to renegotiate his boundaries that means the other side is open to renegotiations too, and since he never wanted the dogs, they just proofed to be really gross in pooping all over the nursery, and you've just shown him you won't respect his boundaries regarding the dogs if it's a major inconvenience for you to do so, he might as well decide he's not up for it anymore and wants to rehome them.", "I don't understand what you're asking.
