My brother is really angry at me over what I said. TL;DR my brother is having a last minute destination wedding and I called him selfish and inconsiderate for it.\n\nYesterday one of my brothers announced he had gotten engaged the night before. Apparently it was spur of them moment and not planned ahead of time. That's what he said. I was happy for them and it was a happy event. But then it came out they were having a destination wedding. Yesterday morning, before they told anyone about their engagement they booked a river cruise on the Rhine river. An 8 day cruise from Switzerland to the Netherlands. The wedding will be somewhere along the way. The cruise starts tomorrow, they flew to Switzerland today and are staying in a hotel tonight and will fly back the day after the cruise ends after a one night stay in a hotel in the Netherlands after the cruise. So a 10 day trip in total.\n\nNot only did they not give advanced notice of the fact that they are having a destination wedding, they did not give any information on the river cruise they are going on. I had to do some Googling to find out what cruise company and prices and itinerary. It turns out the cruise that's leaving tomorrow has sold out already. They didn't give any info on their flights or what hotels they are staying at in Switzerland or the Netherlands.\n\nI get that the engagement was spur of the moment but they only gave 12 hours of notice about the wedding. Besides the fact they didn't give anyone information about the cruise or hotels or anything. People have kids, jobs and other commitments and can't just drop everything on less then a days notice to take an 8 day trip. Not everyone has the money or passports ready without notice. Also the cruise company they are using doesn't allow passengers under 18 for any reason and there are no exceptions. I have 3 kids and my wife and I can't just leave them for 8 days. Lots of our family, her family and their friends have kids and it's inconsiderate to exclude them or expect parents to leave their kids somehow for over a week. It's also inconsiderate to trap your guests on a cruise while you are busy on your honeymoon just because you got married on a cruise.\n\nThe result is that no one is going to their wedding. None from her side or any of their friends. They are going alone. My brother got really angry at me when I told him his last minute destination wedding was selfish and inconsiderate. But it's the truth. Destination weddings are usually somewhat selfish but by not giving anyone notice it's really selfish. I don't even know how they managed to throw together a whole wedding on such short notice. But no one is going because it is so last minute. Still my brother is really angry at me over what I said.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Everyone was happy for us and they saw plenty of pictures afterwards. \n\nOP, what makes you think that you or anyone else was invited?

Maybe, though \u2014 just maybe \u2014 with Elvis.", "My cats have read your comment.  Felix the Fearless has promised to sing the \"Song of My People\" at 4:57 a.m.  Late enough that I won't make it back to sleep before the alarm goes off, early enough that I won't just get up and go into the office.  Jade House-Panther (yes, she hyphenates), has promised to hunt my ankles at the earliest possible opportunity.  Please excuse me.  I must go get the Neosporin, band-aids, and ear plugs ready.", "Can confirm. I'm the cat.", "Glad you enjoyed it!", "Okay but then you would just saying \u201cHey we\u2019re going on a cruise for 8 days, peace.\u201d If it is an actual elopement why mention it in advance? Why would OP\u2019s brother be upset that he was called selfish when he doesn\u2019t even want these people at his wedding? Sounds to me like a very entitled brother, but that\u2019s just my interpretation based on my reading.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m reading as if there was an invitation extended and OP just didn\u2019t mention it. If there wasn\u2019t, then obviously that changes things but it\u2019s still pretty stupid to tell your family \u201chey we\u2019re going to get married\u201d if you have no intention of them joining. Like the entire purpose of eloping is to do it in secret and tell people after the fact.", "My deepest and most sincere apologies.  My cats share your outrage.", "YTA. I guess you didn\u2019t get the hint. They are eloping, they don\u2019t want you, your wife, kids, other family members and friends at the wedding. That\u2019s why they dropped this last minute. \n\nI think it\u2019s incredibly selfish to assume that a wedding has to cater to the guests needs and wants.", "INFO: did they... *want* you there? Did they ever say that? Have you ever had any indication that they want anyone else at all at their wedding? Because that sounds like an elopement, not a destination wedding.", "YTA \n\nYou have all this time to reply to random and niche comments but ignore the main questions asked.\n\n1. Were you even invited or was it just an announcement? \n2. Do you know what the term eloping means or even considered that's what your brother is doing?\n3. You live in his home yet are judging his actions for an event that you aren't financially, emotionally, or physically requested to be involved with? Why?", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 Are you serious???\n\n\nCLUE: You weren't invited!", "Buddy. You aren\u2019t invited. Nobody is invited. They eloped on a European river cruise. YTA, and frankly too dumb to even have a driver\u2019s license.", "Sorry I missed the part where you were invited. If you\u2019re not invited, this post is delusional.", "YTA and very dumb. They eloped and didn\u2019t want you there", "Were you even invited?\n\nSounds like you assumed you were.\n\nYTA.", "\u201cThe result is that no one is going to their wedding.\u201d My brother in Christ, that was their plan from the start. YTA. And a dense one", "YTA \n\nThis isn\u2019t a destination wedding. They\u2019re eloping. I get you not wanting to miss your brother\u2019s wedding, but this isn\u2019t about you \u2014 it\u2019s about them.", "There\u2019s a difference between eloping and a destination wedding. YTA", "Uh, you weren't invited. They eloped, and you weren't invited. YTA", "They are eloping", "YTA, they didnt want you there. They didnt want anyone there. It was NOT a \u201cspur of the moment\u201d decision if the cruise was magically sold out the day before the cruise. Its been sold out for a while. They want to celebrate their love with each other, where it is about THEM! Free of drama and opinions of others. It\u2019s a wonder more people don\u2019t do it this way.", "YTA it\u2019s an elopement and you aren\u2019t invited. You literally said in the comments that you and your family live in his basement and he wanted to let you know he would be gone for 10 days", "YTA\u2026 based on how entitled you\u2019re acting about your brothers wedding, it\u2019s no wonder they ELOPED, instead of having a wedding. \n\nNo part of this story makes it sound like you were ever considered or invited (which is totally understandable and their wedding is in no way shape or form about you). My guess is that you would make their wedding planning a living nightmare since you seem to need attention when when it\u2019s not about you", "YTA. You are confused- your brother would have been the ass if he expected other people to be able to attend his destination wedding on 12 hours of notice. But he did not. What he did was ANNOUNCE his elopement. He did not invite ANYONE or expect or want ANYONE to join them. You called them selfish for having the wedding they wanted. You misunderstanding of this situation has caused your brother pain on what is supposed to be one of the happiest days of his life. You need to apologize.   \n\n\nFor the future-  \nNot all weddings have guests. \n\nIf you are invited to a wedding you will be supplied with all of the information. You will not need to google or investigate the date, time, or place.  \n\n\nCouples getting married are allowed to do what is best for them , not their family or friends.   \n\n\nIf you hear tell of a wedding that you can't go to or aren't invited to, say \"Congratulations!\"", "YTA. Since they didn\u2019t give any information, they didn\u2019t want a wedding, they wanted to elope. Sounds absolutely beautiful, I don\u2019t blame them at all. That will be magical!!!! This has nothing to do with you OP, they\u2019re not being selfish at all. It\u2019s their relationship and wedding plan not yours.", "**At no point did OP say the words \u201cinvite\u201d or \u201cinvitation\u201d in the entire rant**", "They eloped with a heads up to the family.", "YTA They are basically eloping, while giving their family notice & spreading their joy. Nowhere did I see that anyone was invited along. Personally, it would break my heart to miss my siblings or my child's wedding, so I get that you are sad... however, they gotta do what is right for them. They gave 12 hours' notice because you were not invited! No accommodations needed to be made.", "YTA. Read between the lines, my dude. Your brother and his fiance eloped. They don't expect you to be there, and they don't need your shitty judgment. In fact, your judgment is probably the reason they are eloping in the first place.", "If they wanted you there you would have been invited.", "Why is he selfish? He never demanded for you guys to go. A wedding is for the couple so if their choice is to get elope on a cruise then what\u2019s wrong with it? It\u2019s not like he\u2019s getting angry you guys can\u2019t go.

You because you were not invited (they are  e l o p i n g) and them because as soon as you got mad they should have clarified that, oh hey, no, we\u2019re eloping and nobody is invited.", "YTA but ESH - For a lot of family and friends an elopement is tough to swallow. Your brother and his wife suck because they apparently didn\u2019t call it an elopement. Unless they specifically excluded only you and your wife/kids, they could have said they decided to get married just the two of them. I assume they have their reasons for wanting that. \nYou suck because you\u2019re making this about you when it clearly isn\u2019t. \nI don\u2019t agree with all the plain y.t.a. votes because many people enjoy being at a loved one\u2019s significant life event and feel disappointed when excluded. The way you worded your question is an a.h. move though because you lie about it being a destination wedding.", "NTA\n\nCompletely correct.", "Nta the way you reacted to this last minute news feels completely normal in this kind of situation. And as you stated not everyone can drop priorities last minute to come to this spontaneous event.", "Yeah the entire time reading this I was thinking it sounded more like they didn't invite anyone on purpose. \n\nWorth adding that in the comments OP adds that his brother said he had to tell him, because OP and his family live in his brother's basement and didn't want to just disappear for 10 dats.", "My own twin sister decided last minute to get married. She lives on the other side of the country! \nI don\u2019t even think I was technically invited. Haha! \nShe knew I couldn\u2019t afford to go. \n\nI sent her a bunch of beautiful skin care etc to use when she was getting ready for her big day! We video called during the wedding. \nIt was so lovely. She was so happy to be marrying the love of her life! \nI was absolutely thrilled for them.", "He didn't use the word elopement, but you also were invited, so I don't know why you're upset?", "i thought the same thing. maybe they just invited them to be polite bc they thought might be wrong not to but really planned to go alone lmao", "Their mistake was telling them before the event rather than after when they are already married!", "The husband and I are looking into one.  The kids are older and can stay with grandparents for a week or so, and it's time.  Plus, the idea of being on a ship for a week with someone's jerk kids makes me want to jump overboard", "Yesss! Read the room dude lol. He nor anyone on either side was invited. I could understand if maybe she told her friends and they were going or something but they are clearly eloping not family needed. YTA and not very good at understanding subtly.", "You're not invited lol yta", "Yta. Throw them a party when they get back if you Want to celebrate", "Nta especially if he expects anyone being able to come. Did they plan it that way so people would have to miss it?", "Hi there\n\nI\u2019m a bride about be wed in a destination wedding next month overseas. Weddings these days have turned into huge money making stress balls that are entirely all about the family and not the couple to be. My fianc\u00e9 and I have said no to any family and friends joining for two main reasons;\n\n1) Inviting and expecting people to fork out money for a destination wedding is incredibly selfish. We realise our friends and family are all at different stages of their lives financially, and did not want to place added pressure on them to be there. \n\n2) This joyous day is all about us completely. No making sure everyone\u2019s enjoying themselves/ getting along. No stress. No fights. Just whatever my husband and I want to do. It\u2019s a day to celebrate us and no one else. \n\nThere is nothing to stop you and your family putting on a big celebration get together for everyone to mark this wonderful occasion. Be happy for them!", "NAH. It\u2019s ok for them to be selfish and do the wedding that way, it\u2019s their day & it\u2019s about them, but they can\u2019t actually expect anyone to attend.", "Yeah exactly this! You weren't invited.", "Not in Europe, you have to be \u2018resident\u2019 in that country for a certain number of days before the ceremony"]}
