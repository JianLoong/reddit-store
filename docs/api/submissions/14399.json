My brother is really angry at me over what I said. TL;DR my brother is having a last minute destination wedding and I called him selfish and inconsiderate for it.\n\nYesterday one of my brothers announced he had gotten engaged the night before. Apparently it was spur of them moment and not planned ahead of time. That's what he said. I was happy for them and it was a happy event. But then it came out they were having a destination wedding. Yesterday morning, before they told anyone about their engagement they booked a river cruise on the Rhine river. An 8 day cruise from Switzerland to the Netherlands. The wedding will be somewhere along the way. The cruise starts tomorrow, they flew to Switzerland today and are staying in a hotel tonight and will fly back the day after the cruise ends after a one night stay in a hotel in the Netherlands after the cruise. So a 10 day trip in total.\n\nNot only did they not give advanced notice of the fact that they are having a destination wedding, they did not give any information on the river cruise they are going on. I had to do some Googling to find out what cruise company and prices and itinerary. It turns out the cruise that's leaving tomorrow has sold out already. They didn't give any info on their flights or what hotels they are staying at in Switzerland or the Netherlands.\n\nI get that the engagement was spur of the moment but they only gave 12 hours of notice about the wedding. Besides the fact they didn't give anyone information about the cruise or hotels or anything. People have kids, jobs and other commitments and can't just drop everything on less then a days notice to take an 8 day trip. Not everyone has the money or passports ready without notice. Also the cruise company they are using doesn't allow passengers under 18 for any reason and there are no exceptions. I have 3 kids and my wife and I can't just leave them for 8 days. Lots of our family, her family and their friends have kids and it's inconsiderate to exclude them or expect parents to leave their kids somehow for over a week. It's also inconsiderate to trap your guests on a cruise while you are busy on your honeymoon just because you got married on a cruise.\n\nThe result is that no one is going to their wedding. None from her side or any of their friends. They are going alone. My brother got really angry at me when I told him his last minute destination wedding was selfish and inconsiderate. But it's the truth. Destination weddings are usually somewhat selfish but by not giving anyone notice it's really selfish. I don't even know how they managed to throw together a whole wedding on such short notice. But no one is going because it is so last minute. Still my brother is really angry at me over what I said.", "created_utc": 1681073635, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12gvf1h/aita_for_calling_my_brother_selfish_over_his_last/", "score": 111, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They intend to elope with some advanced warning to their families. Not everyone wants or needs a big to-do. I have anxiety disorder and could not handle it. Since cruises like this tend to book up early, I'm willing to bet they planned this trip for awhile and after deciding to get married chose to do it while traveling.\n\nApologize to your brother and offer to help plan a family celebration after they return.", "Yta, based on your title,  I thought that they invited everyone, including you!  Apparently,  that is not the case, and this is none of your business. \n\nThe fact that you called and complained and then came here to complain makes it very clear that you have some real trouble understanding a lot of things.

They are going alone. Sounds like they wanted it that way. If they wanted you at the wedding, they would have planned it differently.

I didn't read anywhere that your brother wanted you  to go.\nSounds to me like they hatched a pretty genius plan to keep you all from attending.\nYTA for thinking that they can't be selfish for THEIR wedding.", "YTA\n\nI wouldn't call what your brother and his girlfriend/partner a \"destination wedding\".

I think it's pretty obvious they aren't inviting you or anyone else to their wedding.  I would imagine, too, that it wasn't as sudden as you've been told since the cruise was already booked up.

Good for them.\n\nYTA OP", "Exactly. It certainly sounds like they didn't want anyone to attend their wedding.", "I don't think thats her fault.  The brother didn't call it an \"elopement\" so that left her confused.", "Plus, him telling OP that they got engaged *two days ago* and then are marrying *today* is quite the hard clue that they're eloping XD", "Yeah considering the brother didn\u2019t even tell them the cruise line, I\u2019m failure confident OP wasn\u2019t actually invited to this wedding \ud83d\ude02", "Most people wanna see their sibling get married", "They wouldn\u2019t give anyone travel information and OP had to find it themselves.

A elopement during a lovely cruise would be perfect", "It doesn\u2019t sound like brother expected people to show up.

I wish people like you would stop assuming everyone on reddit lives in America.", "You don\u2019t have to coordinate with the US embassy.  As long as the country in which they get married recognizes the marriage as legally valid, the US will as well.  The cruise line probably has designated staff to help people planning destinations weddings figure out the legal requirements, and probably have specific parts of the voyage when they recommend getting married due to the ease of the country\u2019s marriage laws.", "?\n\nWe're not American and English isn't my first language.

I was like OP they eloped and you were not wanted at the event, so idk why you are upset", "Well, his brother told him that his wedding choices were selfish and inconsiderate.
