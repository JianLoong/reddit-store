We're originally from X country but moved to Y about three years ago. Despite my boyfriend having a bit of a nasty temper, he treated me well overall. We met in college, and during a challenging time, I supported him financially and tutored him for free. After college, I helped him land a great job. When I got a job in Y country three years ago, I assisted him in finding a job there and even covered his flight tickets. I've even met his parents a few times, and they seemed like nice people.\n\nFast forward to six months ago, a random girl (27F) contacted me on Facebook, introducing herself as my boyfriend's girlfriend. She's in X country, planning a online surprise birthday party for him. Apparently, he told her I was his close friend, so she wanted to invite me too. Here's where the part that I might be the AH begins. I continued the conversation with her like everything was alright so that I would gather as much info from her as possible. She and my boyfriend had been dating for eight years (5.5 years overlapping with my relationship), and they had set the date for their wedding in six months. \n\nI felt blindsidedI, livid and was utterly depressed so I confronted my boyfriend about this, and he didn't even bother to hide the truth. He said he had no choice but to be loyal to her because she's the one he met first, and everything was planned for the wedding. I asked him what would become of me, and why he did this to me but all he said was that these things happen, he would continue his relationship with me even after his marriage and that I should suck it up since he was apparantly doing this as a favor to me.\n\nSo I spent the next few days pretending like everything was okay (we didnt meet in person so it was easier to just pretend). Meanwhile, I documented pictures/screenshoted chats of everything we did durinh our 5.5 year relationship and made them into a folder. Then, I contacted his other girlfriend and sent her all the proof. She initially thought I was lying but after going through the evidence contacted me again to apologize. She also providied proof of their relationship. To our disgust, we discovered he had given us the exact same things for birthdays, anniversaries, etc., with identical pick up lines, identical messages on some days. Prior to moving to Y country there has even been days when he had spent the morning with her and the afternoon with me and vise versa.\n\nAnyway she broke of the wedding and my now ex-boyfriend is demanding that reimburse him for all of the money he had spent on the wedding planning (approximately USD 6000) because I ruined both his wedding and life. I have refused to pay him and also cut off all contact with him but he reaches out using new numbers sends messages demanding compensation", "created_utc": 1702380503, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18gjtbm/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_for_wedding_costs_my/", "score": 1297, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
