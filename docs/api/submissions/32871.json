{"id": 32871, "submission_id": "18gjtbm", "title": "AITA for refusing to pay for wedding costs my ex-boyfriend incurred for his planned wedding", "selftext": "I (27F) have been in a relationship with my boyfriend (now ex-boyfriend) (27M) for 5.5 years. We're originally from X country but moved to Y about three years ago. Despite my boyfriend having a bit of a nasty temper, he treated me well overall. We met in college, and during a challenging time, I supported him financially and tutored him for free. After college, I helped him land a great job. When I got a job in Y country three years ago, I assisted him in finding a job there and even covered his flight tickets. I've even met his parents a few times, and they seemed like nice people.\n\nFast forward to six months ago, a random girl (27F) contacted me on Facebook, introducing herself as my boyfriend's girlfriend. She's in X country, planning a online surprise birthday party for him. Apparently, he told her I was his close friend, so she wanted to invite me too. Here's where the part that I might be the AH begins. I continued the conversation with her like everything was alright so that I would gather as much info from her as possible. She and my boyfriend had been dating for eight years (5.5 years overlapping with my relationship), and they had set the date for their wedding in six months. \n\nI felt blindsidedI, livid and was utterly depressed so I confronted my boyfriend about this, and he didn't even bother to hide the truth. He said he had no choice but to be loyal to her because she's the one he met first, and everything was planned for the wedding. I asked him what would become of me, and why he did this to me but all he said was that these things happen, he would continue his relationship with me even after his marriage and that I should suck it up since he was apparantly doing this as a favor to me.\n\nSo I spent the next few days pretending like everything was okay (we didnt meet in person so it was easier to just pretend). Meanwhile, I documented pictures/screenshoted chats of everything we did durinh our 5.5 year relationship and made them into a folder. Then, I contacted his other girlfriend and sent her all the proof. She initially thought I was lying but after going through the evidence contacted me again to apologize. She also providied proof of their relationship. To our disgust, we discovered he had given us the exact same things for birthdays, anniversaries, etc., with identical pick up lines, identical messages on some days. Prior to moving to Y country there has even been days when he had spent the morning with her and the afternoon with me and vise versa.\n\nAnyway she broke of the wedding and my now ex-boyfriend is demanding that reimburse him for all of the money he had spent on the wedding planning (approximately USD 6000) because I ruined both his wedding and life. I have refused to pay him and also cut off all contact with him but he reaches out using new numbers sends messages demanding compensation", "created_utc": 1702380503, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18gjtbm/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_for_wedding_costs_my/", "score": 142, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't know what he was thinking about, having a wife and a side-girlfriend, but if he told his future wife about you openly he should have thought that you can communicate and connect the dots. Not the sharpest tool in the shed. He ruined his own life, but also hers and yours.", "NTA. So he wants to be reimbursed for his wasted wedding planning does he? Hah! I could say a few choice things about that, but that would end up getting me banned. I think you should send him a bill for everything you have given him over the years and sue him for breach of promise. Let's see how he likes them apples!", "NTA.\n\nAt first, hearing about everything you did for him, I was going to say that he sounds like a leech, but *wow*. I was not expecting the double life.\n\nThis is completely his fault and his responsibility. It's his mess to clean up. You don't owe him anything, except maybe a firm boot in the ass.", "\r  \nNTA - Your ex-boyfriend's betrayal and deceit are unacceptable, and you're not responsible for the consequences of his actions, including the costs he incurred for his planned wedding.", "Nta he's reaping the consequences of his behavior.", "Well, well, well, if it isn't the consequences of his own actions. NTA. I commend you for being cold blooded enough to gather the evidence before letting the other woman know.", "NTA\n\nGet back to taking notes, but this time take your collection of proof of harassment from this ex to your local courthouse and let the police know he is stalking you and why. Hopefully your financials are secure and you've put on alerts with your credit reporting companies and bank. Maybe complete lack of response or acknowledgement will convince him to leave you alone.", "NTA at all. I'm so sorry to hear you were treated this way. Both you and the other woman deserve better. His money deserves to be lost. Don't pay him back a cent and let him lay in the bed he made", "Definitely NTA, fuck him.", "This guy really thinks highly of himself, doesn't he? \n\nNTA, of course.", "This is 100% on him. Money is the least of his problems. Obviously, don\u2019t give him a cent.", "Lol, NTA\n\nDude tried to have his cake and eat it too and now he\u2019s stuck with the bill \n\nKeep copies of all the messages he sends, but keep blocking him", "NTA! lol to even think YTA here, you\u2019re too nice. Neither of you owe that cheating AH a thing! He played you both and he got caught. Good riddance and good on you for playing the situation so cool.", "NTA - he\u2019s delusional. Don\u2019t give him a cent. She would\u2019ve found out eventually and a divorce is more expensive than a wedding. You SAVED him money!", "NTA and you should demand to be paid back for every (insert appropriate monetary unit) you\u2019ve given to him during this fake relationship. Let\u2019s see who pays first!", "NTA...he's actually getting off lightly. I hope better times are ahead for you.", "NTA, he ruined his own life, this is actually insane.", "NTA tell him to compensate you for everything youve paid for and done for him", "Sign of a narcissist!  NTA. Cut contact and tell him you will sue for harassment if it continues. Then follow through if necessary. He didn\u2019t ruin your life, he has set you free. And you are wiser for the rest of your life. Be glad you found out now and not more years down the road. My your beautiful life blossom without this dead weight!", "NTA\nYou just dodged a bullet. Plus saved the other girlfriend a lifetime of misery. Don't respond. Just keep blocking him. \n\nHe'll move on. Maybe he has other women on the string already.", "So funny that he says he owes loyalty to her because he met her first, yet he still wanted to be with you after his marriage. Funny idea of loyalty!\n\nYou didn't ruin his wedding and his life, he did this all on his own. You and the other ex should get together and celebrate. You are both well rid of this jerk. Maybe you could wear your look alike gifts when you go out together.", "After all you did for him and he wants to act like he's the prize!? Yeah, ef that dude. NTA.", "Lol absolutely NTA", "NTA, you are not in any way wrong. You saved yourself and another woman from a cheating asshat. I hope you both have great lives and who cares what happens to Mr Chancer, absolutely nobody. Good luck and congratulations on freeing yourself from some worthless prat.", "Hahahaha, some people... smh\n\nNTA, just ignore him.", "NTA.  Stand your ground.  He did this to himself and you owe him nothing.  If anything he owes you for your financial support while in college, plane tickets, and anything else you bought for him while he was in a relationship with you under false pretences.", "He played the stupid game and won his stupid prize. NTA. You owe him nothing.", "You didn\u2019t ruin his wedding or his life. HE did.\n\n\nI\u2019m sorry this happened but also\u2026. It is a blessing in disguise for both of you.

Not a chance.", "IDK how you can type that out and still have to ask AITA at the end. You\u2019re so far away from the AH that you can\u2019t even see the AH any more. I am sorry you got messed around like that. Keep all your evidence. Tally up everything you spent. Just in case he tries some legal shit. But other than that just block and ignore and try and move on", "NTA. And don\u2019t think you are the AH for pretending to be okay for few days. It was a shock to and you wanted time to process.\n\nAnd I would do cheers for breaking off this asshole\u2019s marriage. Otherwise he would have gotten away easily without any repercussions.", "Change your number", "I'm truly curious. Did his family meet both women and not say anything? She mentioned meeting his family and he's been dating other gf for much longer. Anyway, if this is a true story NTA", "WHAT!!!! \n\nOh but to have even a slither of his audacity\n\nNTA, he\u2019s either delusional or has sustained a brain injury that has made him think that this is ok to even ask. I won\u2019t even mention the effective stalking afterwards. He needs a stark jolt of reality, perhaps via a blunt police phone call reminding him where the line between friendly and harassment sits.", "You know you're NTA.", "NTA.. he sounds unhinged\u2026 be careful.", "NTA.\n\nAlso not your problem. It\u2019s all his. If he didn\u2019t want to ruin his wedding, he shouldn\u2019t have cheated and if he was going to cheat - be a lot smarter about it.", "NTA\n\nHis actions have led to those consequences so you owe him nothing.\n\nthe next time he contacts you through a new number tell him you've got an appointment with a lawyer and will be contacting the police to get a restraining order for him, the threat of legal ramifications should stop the bawbag trying to contact you with his dumbass demands.", "LOL,  pretty sure you know you are not the A, and should not give him a dime.  And I would threaten to go after him for harassment if he keeps contacting  you.", "NTA. The only response that he is owed is \u201c these things happen \u201c.", "Clearly NTA? This reads like a movie script.", "I love your sweet revenge.  Let him go cry himself a river. NTA!  He\u2019s TA!\n\nNext: keep documentation of his contacting you.  If he is harassing you, you have a case.  You also have a case for fraud if you could show that you spent money and resources on him.", "Not only do not pay him put together all the things you paid for and take him to court for reimbursement.

Give him a list of everything you have paid for over the years and ask when he's going to pay you back - he won't!\nBest to chalk this up to experience, block every number he uses to contact you. Lock down your credit to be on the safe side and remember tomorrow is the first day of the rest of your life.", "I cannot believe the nerve of him saying that their relationship can still continue the same way after he and this other girl got married. I mean how do you even remotely think that is fine?", "This \ud83d\udcaf", "Adding to this you can tell him you will deduct it from the money he owes you \n\nNTA", "NTA", "Op says she's met his parents, and they seemed nice. \n\nSince the ex fiancee was the longer relationship, I'm guessing parents have met fiancee too.\n\nThe morals seem to be lacking somehow. I wonder why they didn't bring it up? But considering how much op helped their son, I'm guessing they didn't want to upset the gravy train. \ud83e\udd14"]}
