The sibling understands but still sees why my partner is upset. My partner has been giving me the silent treatment since New Years. This isn\u2019t how I wanted to start off the New Year. I feel terrible about the mistake and have apologized, but I'm not sure if I'm the asshole in this situation.\n\nEdit: for context, me and my partner have been together for a couple months. The twins decided to show up wearing matching outfits, and we all took it a little too far with drinks. I don\u2019t even remember doing it but my partner woke up the next day with texts on their phone saying that me and their twin kissed. I don\u2019t remember doing it but there was a video and we were on the side kissing. I asked the twin about it and they don\u2019t remember it either.

You thought it was your partner, you're not the AH. \n\nHis twin brother is the AH. Drunk or not he knew you're his brother's gf, he could have told you his name. He kissed you and yall cant blame alcohol for this. \n\nYour bf is right to be mad. It was an accident on your part (unless you're lying and knew it was his brother) the brother is totally at fault here", "If it's a genuine mistake NTA.", "NTA.  Your gf is being obtuse.  You didn't know who you were kissing, but her sibling sure as hell did.", "NTA, what's the reasoning behind going with the sale outfit being twins? That's almost asking for awkward situations like this. The twin is an AH.\n And don't drink that much.", "NTA, and honestly, I think you were set up by some combination of your partner and their twin. \n\n\nIf they chose to wear the same outfit, then part of their \u2018fun\u2019 would be confusing people throughout the night, especially once the drinks got flowing. I know too many twins to know that they go out if their way to *not* wear matching clothes if at all possible, because they want some level of individuality, unless there\u2019s an outside structure - tuxes at a formal, for example, or any kind of uniform - or they\u2019re doing it on purpose with the intent to screw with people. \n\n\nAnd while you were intensely making our with his twin, where was your boyfriend during that time?  Either it was a huge party where people can get separated in a crowd, or it was intentional that he was not nearby when it happened. \n\n\nFor that matter, why were people taking video of, what should have looked like from outside, you making out with your boyfriend on NYE? That\u2019s weird, people don\u2019t randomly do that, *unless* person who took the video *knew* it was the twin and not your partner. \n\n\nYou mistaking one twin for the other, that\u2019s pretty understandable; the other twin not recognizing he\u2019s making out with his brother\u2019s girlfriend? Even really drunk, that\u2019s very hard to believe, and this coming from someone who once go so wasted, he was unsure how someone had ended up in his bed with him (I found out later she snuck into my room after I\u2019d passed out, when everyone thought she\u2019d left). He either did it on purpose - because he likely has similar tastes in partners as his brother - or in the heat of the moment and drunken haze, he just didn\u2019t care and went with it, and knew he could blame it on you messing up.\n\n\nPutting the twin in the best light possible, the fact that he claims to not remember it at all, if he\u2019s telling the truth, that\u2019s really suspicious, especially since you don\u2019t either; it sounds like someone spiked *both* your drinks, if the twin is telling the truth. \n\n\nAt least one if the twins is an AH, and it could well be both.", "Did the twin not know she was kissing the wrong man? Did she stop the kiss? How did you learn/realize it wasn't your partner?", "Oops. Lol\n\nYou feel bad about it. You had no idea because they look just alike. But I can totally understand her sister\u2019s feelings because that doesn\u2019t look good for you because you were caught making out with her sister.\n\nNTA. Her sister is for not saying a dang thing and just going along with it.", "why are so many ppl using he ans she and assuming that kind of stuff when we dont know any genders....... a little confused here\n\nnta, i mean u don't even remember doing it. they were dressed the exact same. if they're identical-identical while wearing matching outfits then yeah it'd be hard to tell them apart, even more so while drunk. i get why the partner is upset but at the same time you thought you were kissing them - drunk goggles are weird", "NAH - if it was truly an innocent mistake, then NTA.  Although it's a little hard to believe unless they wore the same outfit.  Your partner has a right to be upset that you kissed their sibling, but I don't think they should hold it over you.  IF it was really a mistake.", "Why did the sibling not stop the kiss? We\u2019re they wearing the same thing and have the same haircut?

If the false twin didn't even react at once, he will confess his undying love to you, and then he will kitnap you, and then you will start to love him, and you both end in a camper on a California beach.

ESH, i guess\n\ni guess if you haven't been together for that long AND they were identically dressed AND everyone was drinking i can see how this would happen... but do they also have the same hair? ik identical twins typically look very very similar in childhood but they typically fill out differently, make different choices about their hair and are easier to tell apart once adults. was this your first time meeting the twin?\n\nif the answer to those questions are \"no\" then i can understand more why your partner is still upset, since it's less understandable that you made the mistake honestly. especially with how weird people get about dating twins.\n\ni think the real problem here is that your partner's brother was just... okay with kissing you? like why did he go with it, knowing you're his brothers GF? what??\n\nyour partner should just quit with the silent treatment and simply break up with you since it's an immature response and he seems like he won't be able to get over this, which i get", "One of the few times EVER that discrete visible matching tattoos would be a good thing!", "NTA. There\u2019s a couple reasons I think it was planned. 1. They showed up wearing the same outfit. 2. The twin didn\u2019t correct you (drunk or not you know who your brother\u2019s girlfriend is) 3. Why was your partner not around for you to kiss at midnight? Maybe also our kissing someone else and left the twin with you so you wouldn\u2019t notice and just didn\u2019t expect his brother to kiss you", "NTA. But I have a relevant story!\n\nWhen my mother was in high school she had a crush on a boy from another school that she'd seen around. He was from another country and had an accent, and he was also very tall, so he stood out. She asked him on a date to a party and he said he'd go.\n\nUnbeknownst to her, this boy had asked another girl to another party the same night, and when she finally got back to him with a yes - apparently, she was very much in demand - he wanted to get out of the date with my mother.\n\n**Really** unbeknownst to my mother, he had a twin brother who he persuaded to replace him on the date. She had no idea she was with the twin of the boy she'd asked out until the end of the night, but by then she'd had a good enough time that she didn't care.\n\nSo that's how my mother met her first husband, my sister's father, and his twin brother got together with the woman he's still married to more than 55 years later.", "NAH.\n\nSounds like the perfect setup for a comedy movie.  If nothing else, sounds like it was a great party.
