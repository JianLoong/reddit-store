The walmart drivers get paid ok for what they do, but the gig drivers expect a tip, and it isn't fair to you that walmart does this.", "NTAH, we here in North American (I\u2019m in Canada) need to collectively stand up to this. A tip is for a job well done, for going above and beyond the call of duty, and recognition the said person did so. And furthermore, I\u2019m not tipping at a fast food joints, eateries that don\u2019t bring my food to my table/wait on me or any other nonconventional type services were tipping was never a thing (43m).", "NTA people in America need to stop tipping for everything and anything", "NTA. Exactly as you said. There's no tipping of FexEx, UPS, USPS or Amazon for anything that you (or the shipper) pays a set SHIPPING cost for. That's why there's a shipping cost - to cover the expense of the delivery process. Walmart pays their employees to do a job and - unlike our current restaurant industry - there is no reduction of pay based on expected tips. Any tipping is just a double dip for the employee, and should only be *if you want to*.", "i've never heard of this, but if it's truly being marketed as \"tip-free delivery\" then NTA. they have to be paying their delivery people enough to bridge the gap from what they'd be paid running for something like uber eats or whatever. tips are only compulsory in america with restaurant servers and things because many only make $2.13/hour.\n\nbut if it's just free delivery, that isn't the same thing as tip free and you should tip.", "NTA. Would it be a nice thing to do? Sure. Do I think you are an AH for not doing it? No. You are paying for a service. It was advertised as tip-free. That is 100% on Walmart. If they want their employees tipped, they should either not advertise the opposite or tip them out themselves.", "Well, wait.  Walmart + InHome is tip free.  Apparently.  \n\nI haven't seen anything about Walmart + being tip free, but I'm up to be proven wrong.", "Nta", "NTA. The deliverance fee should cover the drivers wages.", "I feel too European to understand this. Can't the company just pay the driver decent wages, so customers don't have to? This tipping culture looks insane to me.", "You need to upgrade your account to Walmart deliveries where no tip is asked. They use 3rd party drivers for the lower subscription. So yes you should tip.", "NTA, people seem to have forgotten that tipping is a reward, not an obligation", "I will say this... I buy from Sam's Club and have my order delivered. Sam's charges me $8, and I tip the driver $12. Why? Because I don't drive there, spend an hour or so, drive home, etc. Not to mention, $8 in gas. My order is never less than $200. \n\nI simply place my order for a Sunday morning delivery. Wake up, start making breakfast, eat, clean up, and then my groceries arrive. Put everything away, and move on with my day.\n\nFor me, it's worth the few $.", "What Fresh Shell said. Tipping is a reward, even for servers. If a server never comes back to check on their guests after dropping our food off at the table, should they receive a tip? Tipping is not compulsory. A person is not \"owed\" a tip for showing up to their job, no matter what their job is.", "Dude I had the same subscription. You\u2019re paying for \u201cfree\u201d delivery, you still should tip", "I think there's some confusion there. There wouldn't be an advertisement of \"tip free delivery\" and then the option to tip. And it certainly wouldn't be automatically adding a tip if it were tip free delivery. Also, every delivery service like that relies on tips for their delivery drivers to make any kind of wage whatsoever. I get that everything these days asks for a tip, but it isn't like tipping a robot, because there's a human being on the other end. YTA.", "Yta. One because the driver did not mess up your order. That was the order picker at the store. And honeslty if you're to lazy to do pick up or do your own shopping, you should tip your driver for thr wear and tear on their vehicle. \n\nIf you don't like tipping culture maybe move somewhere it's not a thing.", "you're the reason services like this will be cancelled in the future because walmart won't be able to find anyone to drive for them and those people who have serious disabilities and use them and tip well won't have anyone to deliver their groceries because you refuse to spend and extra $8-$10 and tip your drivers.", "Walmart is the real asshole, but this service is not advertised as \"Tip Free\". \n\nNine times out of ten, they're using Door Dash to deliver. The dashers need tips. \n\nUntil we all make a living wage in America, if you see a tip box, tip. \n\nI have this service. I tip every time.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

FYI Amazon grocery delivery isn\u2019t tip free\u2026.", "agree. Just enabling a broken system that benefits owners and capitalism in general. If someone pays for a delivery service advertised as no tipping they have absolutely zero obligation to tip, not should they be socially guilted into feeling like they should. Sure it\u2019s a nice thing to do, and if you can afford it and felt the service warranted it, yes by all means do so but in this example where zero tipping was stated not a chance is OP obligated. NTA", "Yeah it's dumb and it's getting out of hand", "> There's no tipping of FexEx, UPS, USPS or Amazon\n\n*Yet*", "Would you feel differently if it was a service like Instacart where the delivery person does the actual shopping at the store and delivery?", "The starting wage for WM+ drivers where I live is $17/hr & up so they definitely shouldn\u2019t be tipped like servers or baristas making at or below minimum wage. \n\n\nI always tipped when ordering something heavy or awkward, like the biggest bag of dog food or multiple laundry detergents but not for a regular order. I actually dropped WM+ because it\u2019s a lot of work to not tip & sometimes the app would add a tip even after I removed it.", "It works great for American greed. Wealthy companies severely underpay employees and when customers refuse to make up the difference in tips, they are supposedly the villains for not paying even more.", "Yeah I honestly don\u2019t mind tipping for grocery orders\u2026 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s much different than restaurant delivery except it\u2019s probably more of a PIA considering it\u2019s a lot more stuff to carry.", "Incorrect. I received an extra bag of groceries that I didn't order and was missing one that I did order, which means the driver swapped one of my bags for someone else's. It was his fault, not Walmart's. And I'm not \"too lazy to do my own shopping.\" I do my shopping myself online by selecting my items and checking out. The $110 is what I pay for delivery. Walmart is responsible for paying the delivery driver's wages. Should I receive a tip for being a scientist? That's my job, so I deserve to be tipped for working.", "Why in the hell should I pay someone making $17 and hour $8-$10 for delivering groceries to me? On top of the fees I pay to belong to this membership? I wouldn't use that much in gas if I went to the store to pick it up. I am not going to pay someone MORE than what I make an hour to deliver groceries. So, I won't be using any of these memberships. I will just go get the stuff myself. Maybe WalMart should stop this service and higher more cashiers :)", "Where I live, their starting hourly rate is slightly higher than the starting rate for Amazon delivery drivers so they shouldn\u2019t get tips. It should work exactly like prime.", "My city has lots of postal workers being prosecuted for theft & for throwing away mail lately, so they\u2019re actually tipping themselves.", "Don\u2019t listen to this troll. Tipping in the US has become so ridiculous. I moved away almost 10 years ago and live somewhere where we rarely tip for anything. I have never tipped the grocery delivery driver (whether they outsource it or not) as I paid for it with my order or met a minimum. They are paid to deliver to my door and that is their job. I am not tipped to do my job as a Finance manager.", "That's not how that works. The picker messed up. I know because I used to deliever for walmart. And you are lazy or you would do it yourself. No one asked you to be a scientist but you are asking people for a service you can do yourself.", "In that case, it's okay not to top. People can tip if they want, but shouldn't be forced to. How much do the drivers get paid per hour before tips?", "You used to have a job because people like OP choose to pay for service they'd rather not do. Now you're calling her lazy for basically being the reason you had a job. \n\nYou are not lazy if you choose to maximize your free time and pay for someone else to do it. OP's time is worth money, and they save valuable time but not doing a simple task someone else can do it. \n\nI personally don't do delivery, but I do order pickup and my thinking is the same. Someone else picks my groceries, and I just show up the parking lot and take them home. \n\nThey have a job, and I save about an hour a week. Win win for both sides.", "This is kind of beside the point. People can do a majority of services businesses provide. It doesn't make them lazy to take advantage of a provided service.", "We all solicit services we \"could\" do ourselves. I CAN change my own oil, am I lazy for going to to a mechanic to do it? I'm sure I could figure out how to reshingle my own roof if I needed to, but I'm not going to do that either - I'm going to hire someone. I grow my own tomatoes but not my own wheat. Am I lazy for that? There is nothing wrong with making a calculation that paying for a service is worth more to you in time/money/effort than doing it yourself. That is literally the basis of the ENTIRE economy. \n\nThat said, I think we all have some responsibility to make sure that if we are paying for a task to be done, it involves as little taking advantage of workers as possible in this capitalist nightmare. So OP should find out more about how the service they're subscribed to works and if it relies on customers tipping to pay drivers adequately, they should either start tipping or switch to a service that does pay drivers well.", "Somewhere between $15 to $18 I would presume. Tipping is supposed to only be for waiters and waitresses who are paid $2.40 an hour. The tips are to make up for the other part of their wages. People paid minimum wage or more aren't supposed to be tipped."]}
