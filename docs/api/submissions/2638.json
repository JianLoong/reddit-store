I've been divorced twice and I'm engaged again.  Shit happens,  I went into them with God intentions but was way too young (19 pregnant and scared,  21 newly single,  scared,  much older guy). I didn't ask for help for my second wedding because,  duh, I already did the big wedding.  We did the courthouse and then literally got a 6 foot sub from subway and had a party at our house.  Any wedding after the first doesn't need to be a spectacle.  For this one (been engaged two years,  no rush) I doubt we will do anything other than courthouse if we ever get there.  I mean,  I call him my husband,  we live together and share finances.  There's no rush.  If we add adults in our mid and late 30s want a party,  we pay for it.  No one is entitled to have anyone pay for their own party.  Because that's what weddings have become.  Big parties.  Her mom can throw more money at her.  Or maybe she should suggest a very long engagement.  Some people just love the idea of marriage,  but not the work it takes.

The comment was a bit mean, but after shelling out $20K on failed marriages, you're entirely entitled to it. Has she considered that marriage isn't right for her? There is nothing wrong with acknowledging that something so common and glorified just isn't for everyone.", "NTA\n\nA bit harsh on the 'next one' remark. You could've handled that better imo. \n\nHence, time for her to put on her big girl pants and pay for her own wedding. You've given her $$$$$ the last 2 weddings. That ought to be enough.", "NTA.

She is a grown woman who has gone to the well too many times.", "YTA\n\nIt was uncalled for. you could have said no, without snark. Congrats on your 33, maybe she's looking for that connection you have with your partner in all the wrong places? I'm sure she doesn't love the fact that she's had so many failed marriages.", "NTA because you should not be expected to pay for a wedding at all. She is over 30 now and should pay for her own wedding. It\u2019s not like you won\u2019t show up. BUT a bit YTA for marriage is not that hard comment", "NTA. Your reply was brutal, but when you cheat during your second marriage and get pregnant, maybe it's time to scale down on wedding number 4.\n\nHere is an idea: give her some money as a loan and tell her that she does not have to pay it back if the marriage lasts at least 5 years.", "NTA - was your comment callous? A bit, but that doesn't make it untrue.\n\n$20k over three weddings is fine.\n\nShe can pay her own way now.", "NTA. In my opinion people should pay for their own weddings. You gave her a lot and helped her with two weddings, which is very generous. She needs to act her age.", "YTA for what you said. You don\u2019t have to pay for anything, but that wasn\u2019t a very character building way to say it.", "NTA. That was a brilliant response.", "NTA for not giving her the money. The dig about her next marriage was unkind... but it was really funny, so NTA there too, especially since at least one marriage ended due to her cheating.", "YTA for your comment more than not helping her. \n\nI wouldnt give money either. And if she presses for why explain that you didnt plan for this to be a recurring expense and you cant afford to keep doing this for her. \n\nJust dont be a jerk abt it and youre golden.", "Nah, after the first one she's on her own.\n\nNTA", "ESH. It\u2019s pretty trashy to have a third wedding. The fact that you\u2019re even discussing it is tacky.", "NTA - you\u2019ve already paid for two weddings and she\u2019s now a grown up with kids of her own.

NTA.", "NTA... seems to be so normal to pay for childrens wedding in other countrys. On all weddings i was invited the coup\u00f6e payed by themselves. Its a nice thing when parents pay a little bit, or offer to pay for the food, or the dress or an other little part of the wedding... cant understand why parents should pay a big price...", "NTA and at age 32 she can pay for her own party. About your attitude towards her relationships, whether this one is the love of her life or the next-in-line divorce, she can still pay for her own party.", "NTA.. you were being generous with #2 lol", "NTA \n\nMy cousin is on her 3rd husband and she\u2019s constantly cracking jokes about getting to Elizabeth Taylor levels.       \n\nYour daughter needs to lighten up about the weddings, but take marriage more seriously.", "NTA.

Marriage is supposed to be a life long commitment do her a favour and put your foot down tell her if she stays and lives with her partner for 5 years and shows you a healthy relationship you will help her. You should not have to shell out money every time she changes her mind. She very obviously has commitment issues and she\u2019s dragging lots of ppl into her problems and crying when she is told the truth albeit a harsh truth but at least your not lying.", "Your daughter's marriage success seems to be in direct proportion to the amount you contribute to her weddings, where 1 year = 5K.

Thank me later.", "NTA - tell her your saving money for a 5 year anniversary present, if she ever gets that far", "NTA why should getting married mean she gets a lump sum of money. \n\nIT is not your responsibility to pay for a 32 child's third marriage.

Seems like $5k per year is how much she needs to stay married.", "I am crying \ud83e\udd23\n\nNTA, as long as you do in fact pay for the next one.

In the wise words of Eminem\u2026you only get one shot (with mommy and daddy\u2019s money) \n\nBut seriously, you may have been better off just saying NO.

She's had THREE weddings.  If she wants to keep getting married then she can fund the party.

She's the one who made a joke out of it first.", "I agree with you that you shouldn't pay for this wedding. She's an adult and a wedding isn't a right, it's a privilege. If she cannot afford it herself, she should either elope or have a courthouse wedding or lower her budget so she can pay herself. I don't blame you for your comment either.

I just think that is ridiculous and I'd be saying the same probably. There's no reason she can't have a stable marriage if she wanted to.
