What is wrong with you?", "NTA, you bought the house, maintained it, insured it, and paid taxes on it. You have been more than generous in letting your siblings use it for almost 20 years.

Nonconsensual sex or rape? Fighting? House parties affecting other properties and damaging yours?  Smoking or cooking and set the place on fire?  \n\nI would change the locks, install cameras, and not even allow college students in without their parents (your sibs) in attendance at all times.  This is not the \u2018family cabin\u2019.  You *own* this property; you carry the legal and moral responsibility for its proper use.  Your siblings should not enable anyone, including their children, to access your property without their own supervision and your permission.  \n\nYOU are the one who can be bankrupted when your cabin\u2019s homeowners\u2019 insurance does not cover a huge judgment and you have to personally pay the difference.\n\nAnd, currently, you are aware those kids are on your property and you have passively permitted it, thereby accepting legal responsibility.  I\u2019ve seen how this can end for the well-meaning property owners, even when dealing with close family members, much less random teenagers.  People just believe getting sued into oblivion \u2018could never happen to them.\u2019 Consider legal advice to add structure to your agreement with your siblings (legal waivers, access restrictions, prior notification and consent, etc.)  It might be uncomfortable but it is good property ownership.  Good luck, OP.", "NTA let the school kids use their parents house unsupervised and see if they like it. High school kids don\u2019t care unless it\u2019s their place or their room.

And teens shouldn\u2019t have free for all access to it. You paid for it. You can make it a rule that a responsible adult has to be present 24/7 if kids are going to be there.

Anyone who breaks this agreement gets penalized, based on severity & number of occurrences. \nExample: First strike, no cabin for a month.\nSecond strike, no cabin usage for six month.\nThird strike, no cabin for a year.\nFinal strike, banned for life. \n\nObviously you get to choose how you judge it since you own it.\nAlso swap out all the locks, get ones you can remotely use and give out temporary electronic pass keys.
