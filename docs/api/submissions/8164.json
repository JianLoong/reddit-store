You own the place, so since they cant follow the rules, they don't get to use it anymore.", "NTA. Your promise to your mother was that your siblings can use the place, not their offspring.", "NTA.. if you own it, it\u2019s your choice. If they can\u2019t leave it as they found in (meaning clean) then they have lost privileges.. they don\u2019t have the right to use the cabin. It\u2019s a privilege.", "NTA. Change the locks and retain the only set of keys. Have people ask you again so that they respect that you were at the property owner.", "NTA. The request from your mom was to let your siblings use the cabin occasionally.  They have used it more than occasionally over 17 years and now the privilege has been abused. Change the locks and change the policy. 17 years of you maintaining the place and paying the taxes is more than enough.", "NTA\n\nChange the locks anyway. If you can do an electronic/keypad one, install that. If you have to go with tradtional keys. \n\nPut a ring camera or some sort of camera that you can see if it\u2019s being used without permission.\n\n\nIf you don\u2019t already, make sure that your siblings ask and get permission prior to using the cabin. \nMake sure they know, that they need to be there, not ask for it and their kids use it. \n\nYou have been letting your siblings use the cabin, just because you promised doesn\u2019t mean you need to continue if they aren\u2019t respectful to you and the cabin.", "NTA. If they are using it, they have a responsibility to keep it clean. And they are not fulfilling their obligations.", "NTA - You did not buy it for it to be destroyed and disrespected. You set a clear boundary. They should pay for your time and materials fixing the 'horrible' mess before using it again. Best to you.", "NTA but youre also not too bright. You should never have let kids be there without an adult. you need to make sure your siblings are watching the kids.", "Fair enough but don\u2019t punish all the siblings only the ones who let their kids use it.  Also, if you can install a ring doorbell so you can see who is coming and going that would be good.", "A friend of mine has a family condo on the beach in Florida\n\nThey let friends use the condo from time to time for free.  However, they contracted a cleaning service that comes in after the condo is used and whomever uses the condo is required to cover the cost of cleaning\n\nIf you are a neat person, you end up spending 150-200 bucks...which for a week in a condo on the beach is next to nothing.\n\nThis is what you should do\n\nFind someone in the area that cleans cabins or homes...contract them\n\nAnd institute a new rule\n\nIf their kids or friends use the place, they have to sign a contract stating they will pay whatever it costs to clean the cabin afterwards\n\nSo 1) Change the locks\n\n2) find a cleaning company \n\n3) inform the family of the new cleaning contract rule and let them know that whomever uses the cabin is responsible for any and all cleaning costs and repair.  And that refusal to pay these fees will result in everyone in the family being banned from using the cabin\n\nBasically if one person screws it up, everyone loses out\n\nNTA", "NTA.  This is probably the most valuable thing you own.  If they can\u2019t respect that, they can\u2019t use it anymore.\n\nYou have honored the agreement for 17 years.  That\u2019s enough time.

They can spend the two hours cleaning or pay for a service, at minimum.", "NTA\n\nThey not only broke the rule of  Siblings only, but their kids trashed the place.\n\nYou own this home.  This isn't shared, communal property.", "NTA\n\nThe cabin does belong to you, and how it is treated matters. Honor your agreement with your mom. Tell the siblings you expect the family cabin to be treated with the respect the family cabin deserves. Or no family cabin.", "It's YOUR cabin.  Change the locks anyway.  NTA", "NTA, you own the cabin, even with the promise you made your mother, you are allowed to set the rules on how it is being used. Your siblings allowing their high school aged kids use the cabin to have parties in places you in both financial and legal jeopardy. Yes change the locks, hopefully you can use the electronic ones and if possible also install some type of alarm system.", "Have you sent them photos of the cabin after the kids use it?

I wish I could get electronic locks like a hotel", "I have a friend who just installed a lock with a numeric key code. I\u2019m guessing that is perhaps reprogrammable on the phone", "So get them then? The electronic locks are a great idea and there's a bunch of different ones that can fit ur price range", "Yale Doorman!", "Smart locks are handy for this sort of thing. With many of them you can add visitor passcodes that expire after a programmed period of time, so if someone wants the cabin for the weekend, you can use the app to issue a passcode that is functional Friday morning and is automatically deleted Sunday night. If someone forgets something and needs back inside for a moment after the code expires, you can give them a one-time code that allows them in to grab what they left behind but prevents multiple passes. The locks fail secure in case of power loss and can be bypassed with a physical key if needed.", "NTA.  Most important statement, \"I bought the family cabin\". It was nice of you to agree to let the sibs have use of the place.  It's yours and you set the ground rules for use.  If they can't respect your property than lock it up.", "NTA. The agreement was that your **siblings** could use it. No mention of their kids, or their kids' friends. Therefore you are within your rights to insist that one of your siblings be present and responsible when their kids/kids' friends are using the place.", "NTA You had rules, they didnt follow them. If they complain too much, renig on the sibling deal.", "NTA change the locks and install some security cameras.  If anyone shows up that isn't supposed to be there, call the police.", "NTA it\u2019s your home you paid for and the subs and their kids aren\u2019t pitching in anything but aggravation..don\u2019t give any more chances change your locks and let them know the free vacation place has closed. And you may want to install cameras just in case one of the kids decides to vandalize the place because they can\u2019t trash it anymore.", "NTA - You handled this perfectly. It's perfectly fair to not want groups of high school kids ransacking your cabin. If they had taken care of the place and been respectful I'm sure this would have never been a problem, but they fucked around and found out. \n\nEven still allowing your siblings to use it is very gracious of you, since they basically showed disrespect by allowing their children to leave things a mess. Personally, I'd change the locks and let everyone know they ruined it for themselves.", "NTA - You really do need to change the locks though, you will be liable for something that happens to one of these high school aged kids.", "Change the locks anyway. Your family is protesting that you're selfish. They will keep letting the teens use it. It is your cabin. YOU set the conditions for it's use.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  If the kids can't be respectful of the cabin, then it's reasonable to ban them from using it.  I would change the locks.  There are also some wi-fi enabled locks that can be reset remotely.  Not sure if OP has Internet at the cabin but if he does, this might work.", "How far away is the cabin?  Is there a reason why they cannot pick up a key from you whenever they are going to use it?  That way, you at least know who is in it and can say \"No\" to anyone under a certain age.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.  the promise was that sibs can use it occasionally.  enforce that.  just your sibs. no their children or grandchildren, no nephews, no cousins, no in-laws, no friends, no coworkers, just the sibs.  if that don\u00b4t suit them, then they can take their vacations elsewhere", "NTA\n\nI'd change the locks now no matter what.  Have one with a code you can change.  And are there cameras?\n\nDo they know their kids leave it a mess?  Have they seen pictures?  They can explain to their kids why they can no longer stay there.\n\nEdit: based on your further comments, it sounds like the kids are using it as a \"flop/party house\".  You've got to put a stop to that immediately.\n\nPlus...liability if there's an injury or death of one of the kids or their nitwit friends.  You don't need that.", "I inherited the \"old family place\" I pay all the bills, upkeep etc.. It's 2 miles inland from a provincial beach .\n \nGot tired of \"Cleanergirl the kids/we wanna go to the beach and hotels are expensive.\n\nNew locks and security. Everyone is treated as a trespasser now. Sad but it's my house", "Absolutely nta.  That kind of agreement is not binding anyway.  Good for you for letting siblings use it, but honestly rethink the entire deal.", "Nta. I moved to the mountains and every family member decided it was their right to visit me on holidays and vacations. No one contributed to food or other expenses or maintenence. So after a few years I just started  saying no when someone \"told\" me they were coming. No one was offering to host me on my vacations or holidays. Very seldom hear from family now.  So obvious they only cared about having a free place to stay.  I don't regret my decision. You should not either.", "Funny you should mention this. I went out there to check the best way for security cameras to be mounted. In the driveway was one of my sibs car, I went up and was opening the door of the house and inside was one of my sibs kid with their significant other. They had been busy, well you know\u2026\u201dmoving furniture\u201d", "According to OP the families had their own sets of keys so they can access it whenever they want. \n\nOP def needs to change the locks.", "You can buy battery powered keyless entry that also has a key to use when batteries die. You can give each person their own code and can access the codes later to see who is using it. They are around 60-100 depending on where you live.", "Get a smart lock if you can afford it! You can set a code that allows them access for x days. Also, invest in a camera to see the entrance, at the very least, so if they just give the code out to their kids, you can warn them, then deny them access.", "I agree. If they can't leave it nice, then no one gets to use it. Plain and simple. I have a friend with a small beach condo. Who allows family and friends to use it, but they must clean it and wash the sheets and towels before they leave. Not a huge chore, but some have failed to do that, and well, they don't get to use it anymore.", "It might not be a bad idea just to change the locks and get the cameras setup (make sure to surround the place and not just the front). Then if family wants to use it, they can tell you and you can make sure it\u2019s open for them/a spare is available for use."]}
