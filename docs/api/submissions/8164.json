The sibs started letting their children use the place without telling me and the kids leave it messy and break stuff. I told my sibs that their kids could no longer use it and threatened to change the locks if they couldn\u2019t abide by this request.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You own the place, so since they cant follow the rules, they don't get to use it anymore.", "NTA. Your promise to your mother was that your siblings can use the place, not their offspring.", "NTA.. if you own it, it\u2019s your choice. If they can\u2019t leave it as they found in (meaning clean) then they have lost privileges.. they don\u2019t have the right to use the cabin. It\u2019s a privilege.", "NTA. Change the locks and retain the only set of keys. Have people ask you again so that they respect that you were at the property owner.", "NTA. The request from your mom was to let your siblings use the cabin occasionally.  They have used it more than occasionally over 17 years and now the privilege has been abused. Change the locks and change the policy. 17 years of you maintaining the place and paying the taxes is more than enough.", "NTA\n\nChange the locks anyway. If you can do an electronic/keypad one, install that. If you have to go with tradtional keys. \n\nPut a ring camera or some sort of camera that you can see if it\u2019s being used without permission.\n\n\nIf you don\u2019t already, make sure that your siblings ask and get permission prior to using the cabin. \nMake sure they know, that they need to be there, not ask for it and their kids use it. \n\nYou have been letting your siblings use the cabin, just because you promised doesn\u2019t mean you need to continue if they aren\u2019t respectful to you and the cabin.", "NTA. If they are using it, they have a responsibility to keep it clean. And they are not fulfilling their obligations.", "NTA - You did not buy it for it to be destroyed and disrespected. You set a clear boundary. They should pay for your time and materials fixing the 'horrible' mess before using it again. Best to you.", "NTA but youre also not too bright. You should never have let kids be there without an adult. you need to make sure your siblings are watching the kids.", "Fair enough but don\u2019t punish all the siblings only the ones who let their kids use it.  Also, if you can install a ring doorbell so you can see who is coming and going that would be good.", "A friend of mine has a family condo on the beach in Florida\n\nThey let friends use the condo from time to time for free.  However, they contracted a cleaning service that comes in after the condo is used and whomever uses the condo is required to cover the cost of cleaning\n\nIf you are a neat person, you end up spending 150-200 bucks...which for a week in a condo on the beach is next to nothing.\n\nThis is what you should do\n\nFind someone in the area that cleans cabins or homes...contract them\n\nAnd institute a new rule\n\nIf their kids or friends use the place, they have to sign a contract stating they will pay whatever it costs to clean the cabin afterwards\n\nSo 1) Change the locks\n\n2) find a cleaning company \n\n3) inform the family of the new cleaning contract rule and let them know that whomever uses the cabin is responsible for any and all cleaning costs and repair.  And that refusal to pay these fees will result in everyone in the family being banned from using the cabin\n\nBasically if one person screws it up, everyone loses out\n\nNTA", "NTA.  This is probably the most valuable thing you own.  If they can\u2019t respect that, they can\u2019t use it anymore.\n\nYou have honored the agreement for 17 years.  That\u2019s enough time.

I\u2019m guessing that is perhaps reprogrammable on the phone", "So get them then? The electronic locks are a great idea and there's a bunch of different ones that can fit ur price range", "Yale Doorman!", "Smart locks are handy for this sort of thing. With many of them you can add visitor passcodes that expire after a programmed period of time, so if someone wants the cabin for the weekend, you can use the app to issue a passcode that is functional Friday morning and is automatically deleted Sunday night. If someone forgets something and needs back inside for a moment after the code expires, you can give them a one-time code that allows them in to grab what they left behind but prevents multiple passes. The locks fail secure in case of power loss and can be bypassed with a physical key if needed."]}
