The worst part about this is that I\u2019m Jewish and he does this only when I\u2019m in the room. \n\nThis is the fourth time I\u2019ve seen him do this and each time I get into an argument with him because I say that it\u2019s insensitive. He says that it\u2019s just a \u201cjoke\u201d and I need to \u201cchill out.\u201d I don\u2019t really consider myself sensitive but I have boundaries yk? Each time he does this he always says he\u2019ll \u201cstop\u201d and that he\u2019s \u201ctrying to become a better person,\u201d yet he doesn\u2019t stop? \n\nAnd to add insult to injury, he\u2019s also says really racist, homophobic, and xenophobic things in general. He is a bisexual immigrant, yet all he does is make fun of black people, gay people, and immigrants of other places, saying that they\u2019re \u201clazy\u201d and \u201cshould be deported,\u201d even though he doesn\u2019t even have a green card? \n\nI occasionally confront him for saying stuff like this and he always ends up being the one mad at me. I then feel bad and end up saying I\u2019m sorry even though I\u2019m not. This time around, I called him out a final time and told him I will not stand for his shit anymore and to not talk to me again because why do I have to remind him so much to stop being a Nazi? He, as usual, got mad at me in return, saying that he\u2019s tired as well of me getting mad at him for saying the things he says and that I should be a good friend and acknowledge his \u201cflaws.\u201d\n\nNow the people in our friend group are saying I overreacted and that it\u2019s just him trying to make jokes so I should get over it. My friends are also saying to just put up with him until graduation in a couple months to not mess up the friend group, but we\u2019re going to the same college in the fall and I don\u2019t want him to get the idea that we\u2019re friends. What do I do? AITA?\n\nEDIT:\nI\u2019ve tried to get him out of my life multiple times, but I go to a really small school (120 people all grade levels) and he inserts himself into every friend group. Every time I make a new friend or hang out with someone else, I find out he\u2019s in their group chat, he\u2019s invited to their events, or he hangs out with them.
