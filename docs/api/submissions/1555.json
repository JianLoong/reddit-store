Two of the three sister's have had baby showers for their pregnancies. The youngest is not a mom yet. But they seem to have a theme they use for all the showers. Which is this family history/genealogy thing thing where the decorations are family trees and you get these nursery decorations. My husband said they did the same for his brother's wives when they were expecting. He knows that is not the kind of theme I would be comfortable with and had asked them to not do the same thing, telling them something fresh would be nice for a change. They agreed initially but then said they had a great idea to make it perfect for us.\n\nBut the whole theme is a very difficult thing for me.\n\nI was an affair baby. My mom didn't want me. She left me with my dad and his wife, who didn't want me either but did keep me. I spent 8 years in a house with two adults and two other kids who saw me as a painful reminder of what my dad had done, and who hated me for it. Then my dad and his wife died and I was placed in foster care while my half siblings went to live with grandparents. I was bounced around. Aged out of foster care. Decided to track down my mom hoping what I was told was wrong, but it wasn't and was still very true for her. I reached out to my siblings to see if they had changed how they felt about me, but they hadn't. So I was alone with no family and no family history that I could talk about. I knew my parents names and the names of my dad's wife and kids. That was it. And not one of those people loved or wanted me.\n\nSo the theme upsets me because I have nothing to contribute. My son will have a lot of unknowns about medical history because nobody ever wanted to give me any of that. There's no happy photos or cute stories about a grandma or an aunt to share with him. There is on my husband's side.\n\nDespite knowing all this, two of the sisters are still insisting the theme is going ahead because it's what this family does.\n\nI really don't want to be surrounded by that, and the sadness it brings me. I told them how uncomfortable it made me but they dismissed it. My husband's mom and his youngest sister are trying to get them to change it but...\n\nWIBTA if I don't go? I had suggested that maybe it would be better if they have a party for themselves and leave me out of it but they said they have gone to a lot of effort and I would be rude if I don't show up.", "created_utc": 1667668413, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yn01fw/wibta_if_i_dont_attend_the_baby_shower_my/", "score": 143, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As others have said, please have your husband intervene and firmly insist that if they don't change the theme they can celebrate on their own because what they are doing is willfully insensitive and unkind.

You know this theme makes me sad and uncomfortable. You've been asked to do something different. If you chose to use the family tree theme then I will not come to the shower.", "NTA and you\u2019re not the one being rude. The sister and mother are being very insensitive and hurtful. I can\u2019t imagine being so horribly forceful. They\u2019re awful and I would tell them how hurtful they are.  \u201cLet\u2019s throw a party that we know will upset the person we\u2019re supposed to be throwing it for. \u201c SMH You don\u2019t need their approval to disengage from this.", "NTA. You told them how you feel about the theme and why. For them to continue is just plain awful.", "So very much NTA!! They are being incredibly selfish and self centered. You don't have to be trauma informed to know that that experience is traumatic, just empathy.\n\nSide note: i hope you've been getting help with all the feelings and experiences you've had growing up. That's  lot for any child. Having a child of your own will allow you a lot of great experiences and hopefully opportunities to heal and there's the potential for some triggers to come up. New ones too. I'm assuming this is your first child and I'm going to go there and suggest you find a therapist who specializes in family trauma. I have CPTSD from a severely abusive childhood and children of my own. You can have a shitty childhood and be a fantastic mother. Also it's a good idea with these in laws pushing against those memories in such an awful way. I see the potential for this to come up in different ways and their continued lack of empathy. \n\nDo you have family you picked for yourself in the form of friends? Plan a shower with them instead. Hell, I'd plan you one if that were possible.\n\nDO NOT GO TO THEIR PARTY. That will be triggering. Your baby is going to feel your stress. I don't care what they say, the guilt trip, etc. As someone who has worked hard through their trauma there are boundaries you need to hold fast to in order to self protect. This is absolutely one of them. I know if I were in a similar situation my therapist and friends would be saying the exact same thing. Don't let anyone convince you the exposure will be good for you (making an assumption on not knowing your therapeutic history. If you have a therapist you trust and they think it would be good for you, then don't listen to me) exposure therapy has the potential to cause more harm and new trauma if not done right. It is done in small, incremental steps and with a therapist. Period.\n\nIn the end, babies feel stress in the womb. If that would be stressful for you, it's stressful for baby. And they care about the baby, right? \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude0e", "NTA- you keep asking for them to u Deirdra d and they just keep dismissing you. It\u2019s cruel and heartless. I would not be going at all. \n\nIf you go I feel you will just be causing yourself grief and mental trauma. Let them have there little party, you won\u2019t be there suffering for their sake.", "NTA. Baby showers are excruciating anyway, you're not missing anything..", "NTA. A baby shower is for the mum and dad and the new baby. If any one of those is uncomfortable with an aspect it should be changed. I wouldn\u2019t go. They aren\u2019t listening so won\u2019t listen anyway", "NTA.\nI'm so sorry for you that your SIL's are so insensitive about your feelings.\n\nYou have every right to not go to the shower.", "NTA. Who are they throwing the shower for? Themselves that\u2019s who. \n\nIf you mattered more than just the incubator for the baby then they would listen to and respect your wants and feelings.", "What\u2019s rude is throwing someone a baby shower and purposefully using a theme the person doesn\u2019t want.   \n\nNTA.", "NTA Text them and say thanks but you have already voiced your concern about the party and how it will make you uncomfortable.  If they choose to continue then you will not attend. And it\u2019s rude of them to force you to do something that you\u2019re not comfortable with when it\u2019s your pregnancy.", "NTA. Has your husband told them how painful it is for you (although by now, they should know), he should also remind them that the baby shower is not too make them happy but to make you happy and feel supported. If they said that they have already done a lot, then they can keep for the little sister. If they keep insisting then your husband will just have to say that both of you won't be attending.", "NTA and make it very clear that you and hubs will not be attending because they made you uncomfortable and did not listen to your requests.", "NTA AT ALL. This is YOUR baby, not theirs, and if this makes you uncomfortable they should respect it. Talk to your husband about it, what does he think about you feeling uncomfortable? \n\nAlso, traditions are not always good, and this one seems pretty nice, but it doesn't work for you, and that's okay. It does seem awkward to make a baby shower and the baby not being there. \ud83d\ude05\nYou should talk about it with your husband and your husband's mom about not going bc is a really hard topic for you, they should be respectful about it.", "NTA and they are bogus AF for not caring about your feelings. This is extremely hurtful and douchey on their part.  Both you and your husband have told them this and they're chosing to ignore it. I would make it very clear to them and anybody asks as to why you aren't.", "NTA Thank you for wanting to have a baby shower but since my feelings are dismissed I have to decline as the torture of family genealogy themed party would be very detrimental to my health and there for my child\u2019s.", "NTA. Another post of selfish people not giving two shits about who they hurt as long as they get their way. I'm so sorry OP. I don't blame you one bit for not wanting to go.", "NTA. \n\nThey\u2019re being very insensitive.", "NTA- don\u2019t go. Even if they don\u2019t know your history, you\u2019ve told them you\u2019re uncomfortable with it and that should be enough. If this baby shower isn\u2019t FOR YOU, then there\u2019s no reason you need to be there. And if it was for you, they would care about your feelings and comfort. They\u2019re being jerks.", "NTA- this is very insensitive on their part", "You and especially your husband need to lay down the law here. Either they get it and change the theme from this family tree thing or you don\u2019t participate. Your hubby needs to make it clear to his family that he\u2019s 100% on your side about this.", "NTA for cancelling the baby shower. His sisters are being ahs", "NTA don't go. Don't use the decorations. These women are awful, and his mom is too spineless to over rule them. Tell him not to go either. This is cruel.", "NTA  Showers are not supposed to be thrown by relatives in the first place.  Let them have their party without you, and see if any of your friends will host a shower for you, minus the hurtful theme.", "NTA,\n\nTell them if they do this, you are literally going to cry through the whole thing.  They will not like that, and it\u2019ll make them look awful.", "NTA they\u2019re only thinking about themselves and trying to feed their egos of \u201cthey threw you a party\u201d and who cares about your feelings. Terrible. I wouldn\u2019t go, if they need an explanation just print out what you wrote here and send it to them since they didn\u2019t understand it when you spoke to them about it.\n\nP.S. congratulations \ud83c\udf89 on your baby \ud83d\udc9d", "You do have something to contribute, think of your family tree as you being a seedling that is growing and getting stronger and now you're creating branches that are strong and part of a bigger picture .", "[deleted]", "NTA.

Congratulations and I hope your family create happiness and peace.", "\\^\\^\\^Please OP do this\\^\\^\\^ with your husband by your side to ensure they understand that you are a unified team and if you are not going neither is he. They are the most thoughtless inconsiderate asses I have heard of in a bit and they will continue to shit all over your wishes if you allow them to do so at this time. Fuck that and fuck them! You just go make a wonderful life with you and your husband.", "OP has said what she posted here is the same amount of history they know about. She doesn't owe them any further explanation and hubs has already discussed it with them. MIL and one SIL have realized it was wrong. The other two SIL'S are doubling down. OP should not go and the family needs to defend her against the two SIL'S and shut them down. Imo hubs, mil and sil should all say they aren't going if they don't go with a theme of OP's chosing and then I would put friends in charge, maybe mil and good sil. Not those two.", "I'm really confused as to why the husband isn't putting a stop to this; he can't just suggest they use a new theme, he has to go and say \"STOP DOING THIS, **my wife and I** don't want this theme, and it's a party for US and OUR kid, so stop\". Hell, forgo the whole thing at this point, but the husband needs to step it up, OP is hella stressed about this, she needs way more support.", "The husband is on the wife's side....", "Op you need to grow a back bone fast. You\u2019re about to become a mom. You have to fight for you and for your baby now. Are you going to let them dictate every party even your sons? Because this is technically a party for your son and they\u2019re already completely disregarding what you want. Think about that.", "NTA - I'm no expert on etiquette but I'm pretty sure Emily Post would frown on any host that knowingly chooses a theme that causes the guest of honor pain.  And sticks to that plan after multiple people have protested.\n\n\nThese two are having a shower for themselves and for their own reasons.  Cancel the it entirely. Let the other invitees know it's canceled and be honest (feel free to use my etiquette reference above if you want) if anyone asks why. Otherwise, you're giving these two dumbasses something to hold against you in the future.  They will act like victims and defend their actions by saying something like they were only trying to do something nice but you couldn't bother to show up and you're so difficult or dramatic or whatever\n\nHave a smaller one with MIL, the smart sister and other people who actually like you.  You might be related, but these sisters are not your family or your friends and they don't deserve the chance to pretend they are.  \n\nGet down off that fence and walk away without looking back.

Ignore them.", "I completely agree with katsmeow and jennabear.\n\nAm writing to encourage you not to be afraid of making anyone uncomfortable.  \n\nThe sisters will walk all over you going forward if you don't get this handled right away. \n\nIt sounds to me that one or two (tops) of the sisters are the leaders, and are pushing for their theme (btw, I just bemoan when \"family tradition\" does not accommodate the needs of others.  But I digress.)\n\nYour husband has got to be behind you 100 on this.  And he or both of you would be well served by taking the lead sister aside in a private conversation,  look her in the eye, and let her know VERY CLEARLY AND SUCCINCTLY that the \"tradition\" hurts your feelings, and you will not attend the shower if it is themed that way.  Ask her to change it.  \n\nShe will, like you say, accuse you of causing them to lose money et cet.  Remind her, you have given her plenty of advance notice, and failure to change will be her price of her clinging to her \"tradition.\"\n\nYou have got to stand up the bully.  I'm sorry, it sucks.
