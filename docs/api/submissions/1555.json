Two of the three sister's have had baby showers for their pregnancies. The youngest is not a mom yet. But they seem to have a theme they use for all the showers. Which is this family history/genealogy thing thing where the decorations are family trees and you get these nursery decorations. My husband said they did the same for his brother's wives when they were expecting. He knows that is not the kind of theme I would be comfortable with and had asked them to not do the same thing, telling them something fresh would be nice for a change. They agreed initially but then said they had a great idea to make it perfect for us.\n\nBut the whole theme is a very difficult thing for me.\n\nI was an affair baby. My mom didn't want me. She left me with my dad and his wife, who didn't want me either but did keep me. I spent 8 years in a house with two adults and two other kids who saw me as a painful reminder of what my dad had done, and who hated me for it. Then my dad and his wife died and I was placed in foster care while my half siblings went to live with grandparents. I was bounced around. Aged out of foster care. Decided to track down my mom hoping what I was told was wrong, but it wasn't and was still very true for her. I reached out to my siblings to see if they had changed how they felt about me, but they hadn't. So I was alone with no family and no family history that I could talk about. I knew my parents names and the names of my dad's wife and kids. That was it. And not one of those people loved or wanted me.\n\nSo the theme upsets me because I have nothing to contribute. My son will have a lot of unknowns about medical history because nobody ever wanted to give me any of that. There's no happy photos or cute stories about a grandma or an aunt to share with him. There is on my husband's side.\n\nDespite knowing all this, two of the sisters are still insisting the theme is going ahead because it's what this family does.\n\nI really don't want to be surrounded by that, and the sadness it brings me. I told them how uncomfortable it made me but they dismissed it. My husband's mom and his youngest sister are trying to get them to change it but...\n\nWIBTA if I don't go? I had suggested that maybe it would be better if they have a party for themselves and leave me out of it but they said they have gone to a lot of effort and I would be rude if I don't show up.", "created_utc": 1667668413, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yn01fw/wibta_if_i_dont_attend_the_baby_shower_my/", "score": 1822, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As others have said, please have your husband intervene and firmly insist that if they don't change the theme they can celebrate on their own because what they are doing is willfully insensitive and unkind.

You don't have to be trauma informed to know that that experience is traumatic, just empathy.\n\nSide note: i hope you've been getting help with all the feelings and experiences you've had growing up. That's  lot for any child. Having a child of your own will allow you a lot of great experiences and hopefully opportunities to heal and there's the potential for some triggers to come up. New ones too. I'm assuming this is your first child and I'm going to go there and suggest you find a therapist who specializes in family trauma. I have CPTSD from a severely abusive childhood and children of my own. You can have a shitty childhood and be a fantastic mother. Also it's a good idea with these in laws pushing against those memories in such an awful way. I see the potential for this to come up in different ways and their continued lack of empathy. \n\nDo you have family you picked for yourself in the form of friends? Plan a shower with them instead. Hell, I'd plan you one if that were possible.\n\nDO NOT GO TO THEIR PARTY. That will be triggering. Your baby is going to feel your stress. I don't care what they say, the guilt trip, etc. As someone who has worked hard through their trauma there are boundaries you need to hold fast to in order to self protect. This is absolutely one of them. I know if I were in a similar situation my therapist and friends would be saying the exact same thing. Don't let anyone convince you the exposure will be good for you (making an assumption on not knowing your therapeutic history. If you have a therapist you trust and they think it would be good for you, then don't listen to me) exposure therapy has the potential to cause more harm and new trauma if not done right. It is done in small, incremental steps and with a therapist. Period.\n\nIn the end, babies feel stress in the womb. If that would be stressful for you, it's stressful for baby.
