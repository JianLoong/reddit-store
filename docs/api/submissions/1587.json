We've been together for just over 20 years, married for 16, and have 2 children, 14 and 10. \n\nNever once in the 20 years we've been together was anything like this discussed, agreed upon, or done. Never did either of us said this kind of thing was okay to do, and I don't know where she got that idea from. \n\nA couple days ago, my wife came up to me and talked about a \"trip\" she's going on. I already knew this trip was happening, it's been planned for a while. She's basically staying in a hotel with one of her girl friends for a week. \n\nBut now all of a sudden she said that her friend bought tickets to a male strip show. Which was never discussed prior and was suddenly put on my just the other day. \n\nShe said her friend bought her and my wife both tickets to go to a bar and watch a male strip show together. She didn't come to me asking if it was alright, she just said \"we bought the tickets and we're going.\" \n\nShe was laughing and acting like everything was just fine. Even though I've never indicated I'm comfortable with that kind of thing. \n\nI personally think it's a super inappropriate thing for a married woman to do, especially without asking prior to buying tickets. \n\nWell long story short I yelled at her and told her I wasn't okay with it. I told her it was inappropriate and she couldn't go. She got super upset with me and said that I'm being controlling and I should \"let her have fun.\" \n\nHer (almost) exact words were \"wow, I thought you'd find it funny but now you're freaking out. It's not like I'm having sex with someone else. I'm an adult I can do what I want.\" \n\nToday I told her I don't want her going on the trip with that friend at all, and if she does she needs to cancel the tickets and promise me she won't go to the bar. But she refused to promise anything and yelled at me for being \"a jerk\" in front of our kids. \n\nAITA for telling her not to go and getting mad?\n\nEdit: thanks for the input so far. I agree yelling was an overreaction. It's just not something I'm comfortable with in our relationship, but I shouldn't get that mad and I should just explain myself calmly. I realize I was wrong for that.", "created_utc": 1667702756, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ynel9u/aita_for_not_letting_my_wife_go_out_with_her/", "score": 1049, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Then she should have been able to express her thoughts/feelings on the issue. Then you could each state your boundaries based on your feelings. \n\nYou are allowed to state that, to you, attending the show would cross a boundary and that it would be a dealbreaker for you.

That's part of being married. \n\nWhen you promise to be with someone for the rest of your life, it comes along with a lot of emotional responsibilities. You are SUPPOSED to care if something is making your partner uncomfortable. There should be no reason a married, momogamous person needs to go to a strip show no matter the genders. Go to a concert ffs.\n\nEdit: soft yta for yelling, I understand this is very frustrating but we can communicate like adults", "NTA OP.

But you should talk to her calmly, apologize for yelling, explain that you are not comfortable with this and ask, not tell, her to please value your opinion on this matter. Hopefully not upsetting you is more important than seeing some strippers.", "Why the fuck are y'all giving him shit for having boundaries as that doesn't make him insecure or mean he doesn't trust her.

She's not your property or child. She can decide what she wants to do and where she wants to go. Even if it may risk the marriage. \n\nYou both need to work on your communication skills. Yelling doesn't get points across it just gets loud. You both need to sit down and talk.", "ESH. Your yelling was childish and very immature communication for someone who has been with someone for 20 years, it is controlling and abusive to say she can't go at all. Saying that, your boundary about her not going to see male strippers is fair, it's just the way you communicated that was not. She is an adult who can do what she wants, you can't stop her.

She is absolutely right that you're being controlling and that she can do what she wants.  \n\n\nHere's where she has some blame: yes, comfort level about these things should be discussed. And telling her it's something you're uncomfortable with is entirely fair. Telling her what she is and is not allowed to do with that information is not.", "YTA. She should've brought it up with you to see if you were ok with it, that would've been the better thing for sure.

Ew.", "Ask her how she would feel about you going to the strip club with your friends, especially without her.

Your feelings are valid and worthy of a discussion, your reaction wasn\u2019t. \nAlso, forbidding a spouse(especially a woman) from doing anything is a sure way to make sure they damn well do it, even if they didn\u2019t care much before.", "ESH- you can\u2019t yell or force someone to not do something but you can set boundaries.

You have to apologize to your wife and kids. And your kids should see you apologize to your wife. Show them how to be better people.", "Info: Why are you uncomfortable with her going?\n\nThere's no nudity. It's men in speedo-like things dancing. Is she not allowed to go to the beach or a pool because that makes you uncomfortable?", "YTA\n\nYour wife doesn't need your permission or your blessing to do anything. I sense some real insecurities with you if you think her going to a strip show is a huge issue.", "ESH. You're kinda the AH for allowing YOUR insecurities to control the way she lives her life. I can see how your feelings are valid, but that doesn't make it right to try and control a grown adult. You start controlling her, she'll eventually try to find a loop hole around things, worsening the trust foundation.\n\nHere's the thing, if she wanted to cheat on you, she wouldn't have told you she was going to that bar, she would have just gone. Here's the other thing that makes her an AH. Kinda. She probably already had that planned with her friend but told you last minute cause she was scared you'd act this way. Knowing you'd act bothered, she still tells her friend yes. Bigger question here is.. Where is her change coming from? Who is this friend of hers? Something is going on with your wife for her to go against the current after so many years.\n\nI get you are trying to prevent your wife from possibly destroying the family, but everyone is right. Yelling is not the way. Her insulting you in front of the kids is not the way. Ya'll have a trust problem to fix.", "YTA\n\nI do agree you should have a discussion with your wife about what your boundaries are. I actually had this with my partner at the outset of our relationship. I'm okay with him going to gentlemen's clubs and even getting lap dances as long as he's respectful of the performers and does not engage in any form of sexual activity with them. But if you have other less permissive boundaries that's okay ... AS LONG AS YOUR WIFE AGREES TO THEM. See, the problem here is she IS an adult and while I do believe this is a conversation you should have had twenty years ago it sounds like her idea of fidelity towards you is not the same as what you want to see and you two really need to resolve it.\n\nThe part where you're definitely an asshole is twofold. 1) You yelled at her and 2) you tried to make her cancel her trip just because her friend got tickets to a strip show. That is controlling behaviour. This is your wife. You ostensibly love and trust her. You have two children with her. You can resolve this conflict in a respectful way.\n\nI advise you to \"let\" her go on this trip and accept that she may decide to go to the strip show. When she gets back have an adult conversation about what your boundaries are and what hers are. This escalated real fast so you might want to have a marriage counsellor there to make sure you both approach this in a way that doesn't do more damage.\n\nLastly, male strippers tend to be pretty cringe. You have nothing to worry about.", "First of all, unlike female strip clubs, there is no nudity in these shows.  The guys usually have Speedo\u2019s or thongs on which is something you can easily see at a public beach.\n\nSecond, you yelled at your wife and then forbid her to go?  What is she 12 or something?  Learn to have an adult conversation.\n\nLast, all you did is throw up a wall in your marriage by your attitude and reaction.  Think she is going to be honest with you the next time she plans something you may vaguely even feel uncomfortable with.  Especially if you make her cancel this one.\n\nNow, personally I would never stay married to someone as controlling as you, but since she still is, I can guarantee that you will never know what she\u2019s really doing when she goes out with the girls, since you have such tender sensibilities and want to keep her under your thumb.", "YTA - you should have had an adult conversation with your ADULT wife about how you felt instead of trying to put restrictions on her like she is your child. You\u2019ve handled this terribly. Also, you need to figure out why this is making you feel so strongly. Male strip shows are very different than female strip clubs. They are usually funny, more of a theme show.", "ESH. \n\nYou should not overreact, and it's a little bit controlling to *tell* her what to do or not do, instead of having a conversation with her about your feelings and why you feel the way you do. \n\nShe should respect your feelings and that you're not comfortable with her going to a strip club. For all those saying \"YTA\", I would guess they wouldn't be saying that as much if the genders were switched around.\n\nIf you truly want to be petty (and I do not recommend this, it's not healthy for your relationship), you could tell your wife, fine, you and a couple bros are going to get drunk and go to a strip club as well. Don't do this if you care about your relationship though.", "Do you trust your wife?  Is there good communication?  You've been together for 20 yrs so there must be trust and communication.  Being blindsided with...what!?.....strippers, but why, why are you going to \"THAT\".  I don't think your the AH for being mad or upset but YTA for yelling and telling her she can't go.  She's a responsible married adult.  Treat her as such.", "YTA - for not trusting your wife and trying to control her. Male strippers are entirely different from female strippers, it\u2019s actually more entertaining to watch the audience. Back in the \u201890\u2019s I took my mother in law to see the Chippendales, and I waved a $5 over her head so that the dancer would come over to her. He never touched her, just gyrated and winked at her, and took his tip. The look on her face was priceless! \n\nSo, after 20 years together you think she\u2019ll cheat on you with a guy half her age, who probably already has a girlfriend or wife or sugar mama? Your boundaries are prudish and you need to lighten up. It\u2019s 2022, not 1950.", "NTA - The people saying yta would say the opposite if the roles were reversed.

Does she know your boundaries? We are all allowed to have boundaries, that doesn't make you controlling. It's not fair to hold someone accountable for mistakes they didn't even know they were making though. Anyways, I'm sure a lot of people would be saying the opposite if it was a man at a strip club with his friends.", "NTA, you set your boundaries and your wife of 2 decades isn't respecting them. Had this been the other way around and you did that to your wife, everyone would be coming here to say that you're the asshole for not respecting your wife's boundaries. It's not acceptable in this sub for men to have boundaries for themselves because of the mob mentality here. Your wife could literally go fuck some other guy and people would still say that you're the asshole. This entire sub is pathetic.", "YTA. Frankly, this is outrageous. How else do you control her? Is she allowed to choose her own clothing? Her own friends? She wanted to do something and your response was to yell at her. Not cool, and your edits here don\u2019t necessarily make you look any better.", "YTA \n\nYour wife is an adult. There is no telling her what to do. Now you can say you don\u2019t want her to go, you can say it makes you uncomfortable, but you don\u2019t own her, you don\u2019t get to tell her she can\u2019t. Period. \n\nThe fact that she thought it was NBD and that you\u2019d think it would be funny shows that the vibe of your relationship was one that made her think it was okay.

Anytime there\u2019s a post like this where the situation is flipped and the woman is upset with her man for going to a strip club, redditors flock to NTA. This is simply is a reasonable boundary. She should respect that you aren\u2019t comfortable with this, even if you have been together for 20 years. \n\nYeah, you definitely shouldn\u2019t have yelled. Addressing the situation calmly would have been the right thing to do but boy is your wife acting inconsiderate.", "I don\u2019t think anyone of you is an asshole. \n\nAnyone who wants to maintain a healthy relationship should respect their partners boundaries. \nI (f27) would be totally fine with my husband (m32) going to a strip club.

If it was the other way around I would want him to respect me, right? \n\nI do however think it is important that everyone talk about their boundaries in a nice and respectful way.

We've been together for just over 20 years, married for 16, and have 2 children, 14 and 10. \n\nNever once in the 20 years we've been together was anything like this discussed, agreed upon, or done. Never did either of us said this kind of thing was okay to do, and I don't know where she got that idea from. \n\nA couple days ago, my wife came up to me and talked about a \"trip\" she's going on. I already knew this trip was happening, it's been planned for a while. She's basically staying in a hotel with one of her girl friends for a week. \n\nBut now all of a sudden she said that her friend bought tickets to a male strip show. Which was never discussed prior and was suddenly put on my just the other day. \n\nShe said her friend bought her and my wife both tickets to go to a bar and watch a male strip show together. She didn't come to me asking if it was alright, she just said \"we bought the tickets and we're going.\" \n\nShe was laughing and acting like everything was just fine. Even though I've never indicated I'm comfortable with that kind of thing. \n\nI personally think it's a super inappropriate thing for a married woman to do, especially without asking prior to buying tickets. \n\nWell long story short I yelled at her and told her I wasn't okay with it. I told her it was inappropriate and she couldn't go. She got super upset with me and said that I'm being controlling and I should \"let her have fun.\" \n\nHer (almost) exact words were \"wow, I thought you'd find it funny but now you're freaking out. It's not like I'm having sex with someone else. I'm an adult I can do what I want.\" \n\nToday I told her I don't want her going on the trip with that friend at all, and if she does she needs to cancel the tickets and promise me she won't go to the bar. But she refused to promise anything and yelled at me for being \"a jerk\" in front of our kids. \n\nAITA for telling her not to go and getting mad?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She should have talked to you first but you handled it REALLY badly. You also shot yourself in the foot because she will absolutely go now. \n\nI have been in a situation where a spouse did something I wasn\u2019t comfortable with (nothing similar to this: he posted his opinion in a way I found personally offensive). I went to him and said, \u201cCould you take this down? I know this opinion is important to you but the way you shared it is hurtful to me.\u201d\n\nHe honestly hadn\u2019t seen it from my perspective. Once he did, he took it down immediately. At no point did I forbid him from posting it. At no point did I yell. I just expressed my feelings and shared why I felt that way. \n\nPeople screw up in marriages. They do things that are thoughtless. They do things that are hurtful without realizing it. Your wife straight up told you she thought you would find it funny.

She shouldn't be entirely disregarding how uncomfortable this makes you.\n\nBut the right way to discuss boundaries in a relationship between two mature people isn't just yelling \"You're not allowed to do X.\" It's establishing expectations for how the other person will respond, and then sticking to it with your actions. e.g. \"If you go to a strip club, I would consider it the same as cheating, and expect an apology/pursue a divorce/[insert appropriate & considered reaction].\"\n\nAgain, ideally it's a conversation for long before such a trip is planned, but it's probably still a good way to set expectations and commit *yourself* to a response you think is fair, not just a knee-jerk \"no you can't\".", "Gentle YTA\nYelling is not ok, trying to forbid your adult wife from doing something is not ok.

This may or may not apply to your marriage, so disregard if you like.  It's temping to create a mirror or an equal image and say well, if she wouldn't be comfortable with me going to strip clubs, why would I be comfortable with her going to this show?  To some extent, sure, fair enough.  But let's face it, in this year of our lord 2022, sexual relationships still don't hold equal power by and large.  Women are still raised to be the ones to turn down sex.  They're raised to be afraid of it to some extent. Maybe not literally afraid, but afraid in terms of bearing the burden of the consequences.  They're (we're) raised to know that men will push and we have to say no because we will bear the consequences if we don't say no (whether social, physical or otherwise). We're raised to guard our safety when walking at night, to be careful of who hands us a drink at a bar, to have a friend know where we are at all times etc.  We live in a world where we have to be disgusted by dick pics because they aren't given with respect and reverence, but in the spirit of malice and control.\n\nIt's often not until later in life that women can really feel comfortable and in control of our sexuality.  It's possible that for your wife, being able to go to a show like that is totally liberating and - again, hear me out - will translate into more intimacy and ability to be free with you in the context of your intimate relationship.\n\nAgain, I know, downvotes, but women have a reflexively negative reaction to a dick pic or the like.  What if they had equal power and were able to celebrate that? What if that would make your relationship more amazing and electric? What if your wife is feeling more confident and comfortable and wants to have her marriage grow in great ways along with her growth? What if maybe you just talked to her about what she's getting out of it and why she wants to go and trusted her?\n\nI think the falsity of the mirror (the \"well she wouldn't want me going to strip clubs\" mirror) is that for men, gong to strip clubs (often) reinforces their power over women, or at least celebrates their power to freely have access to women.  For women, the experience may be different.  Maybe just think a bit and talk to her before reflexively shutting this down?

The former is focussing more on entertainment, the latter is about being personally sexual.", "Yeah I\u2019m a little astounded by the comments. I\u2019m a woman and not particularly comfortable with my husband going to a strip club. Before he ever went he asked me first how I\u2019d feel.

Like you\u2019ve been married 20 years grow up", "This is sounding like insecurity on your part. \n\nI\u2019m gonna note that women often laugh hysterically when attending male strip shows with their girlfriends \u2014 check out some footage of a Chippendale gig. They clap and scream, but she isn\u2019t attending this to cop some strange. It\u2019s a fun night out.  \n\nWhat is the issue here? My partner went to a strip club for a friend\u2019s bachelor party. I\u2019ve also been to one with him before \u2014 the strippers aren\u2019t going to *fuck* him, so what is the cause I would have for concern? He finds them hot? Okay\u2026.and? \n\nThis is clearly my own relationship guideline, but I don\u2019t really understand why some couples try to control attraction and act like it\u2019s taboo. How your partner *acts* in these situations is the key thing here, that\u2019s trust. Keeping them on a leash and away from people they find might attractive because it \u201cprevents cheating\u201d isn\u2019t the answer \u2014 that\u2019s not trust, it\u2019s control. \n\nI guess I need some INFO. What is the concern about her attending a strip club? I need more than \u201cit\u2019s inappropriate.\u201d Why is it inappropriate? Are you guys conservative? Is it a religious thing? Is she not supposed to find men attractive anymore?", "YTA. She is correct, you speak like you own her. Even in your own written details you come across like an overbearing father instead of a husband. My boyfriend and I have been together for a year and have worked this issue out and communicated better than you and your wife. After 20 years I\u2019d think you\u2019d be stable enough in your relationship to let her go out with a friend, I was wrong.\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve scrolled for a good amount of time. Your comments and replies are gross. Your inability to respond to anyone except the people backing you up shows you don\u2019t care about communicating with your wife, you care about controlling her and being backed up by other men. Especially you egging on the situation by replying to people suggesting that you start another fight with her with \u201cI will say/do that, thank you.\u201d Or \u201cYeah we\u2019ll see how she likes it.\u201d She should\u2019ve left you years ago.", "YTA she does not need \"permission\". You are controlling because you decided she must obey your orders. She told you, so it is not like she is hiding something she knows you would disagree with.  You are more than fair if you talk about how you are uncomfortable with it but really it is your insecurity that is a problem. Your wife has had men hit on her before and going to a strip show does not mean she is wanting an affair. So you are not mad she is around men you are made she is wanting to look at buff men showing their junk. You are worried she might now want someone hotter than you. If you trust your wife then this is not a big thing.", "Not \u201cletting\u201d your wife go? She should have \u201casked permission\u201d first? YTA.", "You're wrong about a lot more here. Totally YTA.", "YTA", "YTA", "INFO: How small is your penis?", "INFO - just to be clear, you yelled at her about this in front of the kids?", "YTA - Not for disliking your wife going to a strip club BUT for demanding she not go or cancel the trip. \n\nShe is NOT your child. You do not get to tell her she cannot do an adult activity that doesn't break your marriage vows. Yelling at her is also disrespectful and mean when she had no way of knowing in advance how you felt about this.\n\nI have been married 22 years myself. If my husband yelled at me and demanded I cancel a show or trip I was looking forward to with my friend? \n\nI would absolutely still go and refuse to back down, just to prove I was not his property and he does not get to make controlling demands. It would absolutely become my hill to die on, and I tend to be somewhat submissive to him normally. \n\nI would never make a demand like this of him like you did of your wife either. I would feel uncomfortable with my spouse going to a strip club as well but if a friend took him while he was going out of town I would understand and just ask him not to do anything that would affect our marriage. \n\nYou need to apologize for disrespecting your wife's autonomy as a grown woman. You need to have a real conversation without any demands or judgement. And you need to back off and let her do this in order to make your partner happy because at this point it is the only way to redeem yourself and your actions.", "YTA. You have been with her for 20+ years and you think she would act inappropriately around semi or full naked men.. like all of a sudden, she would throw away her marriage over some random scantly clad dude. You have issues m8, not her, this is your issue and you really need to look inward and figure this crap out. Looking at a naked male form is not a threat to your marriage, however your behavior definitely is. You don\u2019t trust her, and you need to figure out where that\u2019s coming from.", "YTA, but you already know that.", "Y\u2019all suck; especially those of y\u2019all excusing women going to strip shows while saying it\u2019s different for men.

People are allowed to have boundaries. Love how you\u2019re called insecure and controlling if you don\u2019t want another person literally dry humping and shoving their genitalia and breasts/pecs in your SO\u2019s face.

ESH.", "Also Strip clubs for straight men are about getting off, and for women they are about laughing.  Completely different atmosphere, I've been to both.  Not sure why, but women mostly find male strippers funny, even if they are hot, women don't get their rocks off at the strip joints.  Men do when watching women, I don't know what goes on at gay or lesbian strip clubs.", "If the genders were reversed and it was the husband wanting to go to a strip club with his friends, would you support that too?\n\nI feel like sometimes people give women a pass for the same acts that they shit on men for doing.

Now suddenly its on the table AND he is in the wrong for being upset his wife wants a BASICALLY naked man to grope and rub up against his wife??? yikes man.", "I agree. This could be solved with proper communication. Male strip shows like this are basically burlesque. She should've told him about what it entails and he shouldnt have yelled when he didn't even know what it was. \n\nAlso why the fuck haven't they discussed their boundaries yet", "They are literally a clown show, the roles and performances are classic clown but the costumes are different.", "Shouldn't matter if it's considered \"funny\" if your partner is uncomfortable with you should refrain from doing it. He shouldn't have yelled, but she should respect his wishes. \n\nIf she goes then he should have the right to visit a female strip club.", "I agree with you. Personally strip clubs don\u2019t bother me either way. But saying it would different if he was doing it is bs.", "The reason the replies are gender biased is that gender matters.\n\nPower imbalance and gendered biases in our society mean that often changing the genders in a given situation actually changes the entire situation.

And your fedora too, you don\u2019t need that here.", "What was the \u2018especially a woman part for\u2019 may i ask? No spouse should forbid another from doing anything, boundaries should be discussed for sure, gender has literally nothing to do with it unless OP is viewing it as he\u2019s the man of the house type thing which isn\u2019t what seems to be happening.", "How is she supposed to read minds when he hasn\u2019t communicated his \u2018boundaries\u2019 and the first time he did was to sulk then yell at her like she\u2019s a child?\n\nMale strip club is a show.

Full nudity or not, these shows are still sexually suggestive.", "We say YTA because instead of saying \u201cI don\u2019t feel comfortable with that\u201d he immediately jumped to yelling at her and telling her she can\u2019t go on the trip at all. If you want someone to have a discussion with you, yelling isn\u2019t the way to go. She\u2019s not inconsiderate. I\u2019ve been to a male strip show and it\u2019s VERY different from normal strip clubs. I thought I was signing up for magic mike. And that isn\u2019t what I got.", "Thank you. You summed up my thoughts exactly. \n\nOP YTA", "While OP definitely should have handled his situation better (and even he recognises that) why is a person's comfort not relevant if they are in a relationship with someone else.

I've been married 10 years and we've never discussed whether the other could go to a strip show. If the opportunity came up we'd discuss it then but realistically it's unlikely given our social life and living rurally. It wouldn't even cross my mind to ask if I was in a similar situation to OPs wife, I would have just told my husband. The difference here is that a male strip show (like Magic Mike) is quite different than a strip club where women are stripping and providing private lap dances. While I trust my husband it is still a different environment. Maybe OP doesn't realise this? One is a bit of fun,mainly a laugh,the other can be quite seedy.", "Where I live there\u2019s no male strip clubs. I haven\u2019t been to a strip club since I was 19. Me n my wife have never brought it up because it\u2019s never been there to discuss.", "If it never comes up, why would you discuss it?

I don't see why this would be something that's brought up considering it's sort of a single thing to do anyway.

Neither have interest in going by themselves and are never invited by someone else. For some people, it would only be relevant to discuss when it came up. That's where OP really dropped the ball, because he said he never communicated he was comfortable with it, but he clearly never communicated he was uncomfortable with it either. That was the time to have the conversation about it, and instead he acted like she should've just read his mind and known how he felt about it. \n\nThat being said, the fact that he has a huge issue with it is something that he should've already told her at some point. Obviously if you care about something this strongly then it should be communicated. The burden to bring it up is on the person who has the problem with it. Why should she just assume by default that he has a problem with it if he's never brought it up? That was super unfair.

Also, why did they have to yell at each other in front of the kids?", "\"Honey, I'm taking a week off to go to a strip club for one night\" \n\nyeah, totally not suspicious...", "What's to talk about? He said he didn't want her doing that and she said \"too bad\". She's going to do something that makes him uncomfortable, and there's nothing he can do about it. Of course he'll be upset, it's major disrespectful. What's he supposed to do, pretend he's okay with it when he's not?", "I wouldn't jump to leaving her just yet. That's too drastic too soon.  How about some communication first and go from there.", "But a female strip club isn\u2019t the same as a male strip show.  They\u2019re different genres of entertainment.", "probably not. If she yelled and him and forbade him i was say she is the ahole. I think she certainly made a mistake but i don\u2019t think she\u2019s being an ahole.", "Is this some sort of assumption that this is all a sexist double standard? Cos I don\u2019t give a shit if my husband goes to a strip club.", "I feel like if they've been together for 20 years, she should already know that he would not like the idea of dicks swinging in her face lmaooooo\n\nEdit: Also, when would this even come up? Normally people don't frequent strip clubs so idk if i would have even thought to talk about this", "What are you going on about? They don't support anything but normal talking and not yelling\n\nStop this gender bullshit, it has nothing to do if OP is a woman or a man. Yelling isn't ok, have a normal talk like an damn adult", "YTA because you can't order your wife around & tell her she *can't* go on her trip or if she does she *can't* go to the show like she's your child. Yelling at all was completely wrong. Can you be uncomfortable? Yes. However, you can't use it to force her into doing what you want. You're being controlling instead of communicating & trusting the person you married. You speak as if she's your child & not your wife, too. She doesn't need your permission to see a strip show. Also, if it's like the Thunder Down Under for example it's not the type of show you're imagining. After all of this time you either trust her or you don't. As of right now you're acting like a suspicious husband & a father telling his teen that she can't go to the prom. Apologize & actually have a conversation without yelling or demanding while remembering she's not someone you can order around.", "Calling male strip shows burlesques is demeaning tbh\u2026 and some are indeed very sexual", "It depends on the state, but if it\u2019s in a bar that doesn\u2019t regularly have strip shows, it\u2019s unlikely to be fully nude. For example, in Las Vegas, strip clubs can either be full nude or sell alcohol but not both.\n\nMy guess is that it\u2019s probably more of a male burlesque show than a strip club. The dancers will dance and strip down to thongs, there will be lots of flexing of muscles and gyrating and the women will laugh and cheer and jokingly fan themselves over the hot guys. It\u2019s sexy but not sexual.", "He most certainly has a \u2018right\u2019 to go\u2014a partner is in no place to tell their partner that they\u2019re forbidden to do something.

It\u2019s a club where people get undressed, and op\u2019s boundaries are as much valid as if the genders were changed.", "Congratulations, you\u2019re sexist! But at least you\u2019re aware of it, I guess?", "FWIW, I think you are NTA. My husband and I always check in with each other to make sure something is ok. Even for totally mundane stuff, like \u201chey I have this opportunity to work next Thursday, is that ok?\u2019 or \u2018my friends want to get together for a bbq next weekend, do we have anything else planned\u2019. So we always \u201cask permission\u201d.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s disrespectful to do so, in fact I think it\u2019s respectful to ask your partner\u2019s feelings, even when it comes to things like purchases. \n\nWomen on here are saying that your wife doesn\u2019t need to ask you permission, what if you went out and bought an expensive car without your wife\u2019s knowledge, what if you stayed overnight a female co-workers house, these are potentially things you may have never discussed with your spouse because these are common sense things to discuss with your partner before hand, but your wife didn\u2019t discuss if you would be comfortable, she just went ahead and said she was doing it. I have never told my husband that he can\u2019t touch a half naked woman, but according to everyone here that\u2019s perfectly ok if he does because \u201che\u2019s a grown ass man and doesn\u2019t need to ask permission\u201d and I in the 20 years that we\u2019ve been married, I\u2019ve never outright set that boundary. For those that are saying that it\u2019s not compatible, well if it\u2019s the type of male strip club I\u2019ve been to they literally take your hand and put it on their body. I haven\u2019t gone to a male strip club in over 20 years, but when I went 3 different dancers propositioned me to meet up with them after. Should you have not yelled, sure, should she have come to you saying this is what we\u2019re thinking of doing, the strip club has on stage dancers only, are you comfortable with that? Absolutely. If she had treated you with respect, you may have responded more respectfully. Also, I\u2019m not saying these things because I\u2019m a prude, my husband has been to strip clubs for bachelor parties and he goes away on guy\u2019s trips, but he would never plan a trip and then, after planning it, say I\u2019m going to a strip club. He would definitely ask if I\u2019m ok first and he would definitely be man enough to tell his friends he\u2019s not participating, rather than insisting he has to go because his friends are. \n\nI think it\u2019s hysterical because all the women here saying she doesn\u2019t have to ask permission, you know their husbands ask them permission for everything and that\u2019s perfectly acceptable.", "I\u2019m so confused at all the comments saying male strip shows are more like Burlesque. There\u2019s a show that tours in Canada and its SO different from female strippers but in the complete opposite way. \n\nFemale strippers usually have strict no touching policies and you will get kicked out if you touch them. They give lap dances but it\u2019s usually almost like they\u2019re floating over top of you not dry humping you. \n\nMale strippers, though? At the ones I\u2019ve been to they will literally pick you up, throw you around, and dry hump the fuck outta you. I had one who picked me up, laid me down on a table, and grinded on me so intensely I could feel his dick piercing. No woman there considered it a \u201cfunny show\u201d, they were all basically drooling on the floor and paid like $20 to take pictures with these guys.\n\nIn my opinion (as a 22 yr old woman in a relationship) male strippers are completely inappropriate for someone in a relationship to attend. \n\n*not saying it\u2019s right to yell at or tell his wife what to do, but I think there\u2019s valid reasons to \u201cfeel so strongly\u201d.", "Don\u2019t listen to him. It is not a good idea.", "You should include this in the post because it seems like you started yelling at her as soon as she said she is going to the club with her friends.", "sure, and i\u2019m sure they have too. Sounds like it\u2019s their first strip show deal thingy together though and it just hasn\u2019t come up.", "I got to chat with a few of the guys from the clubs I went to, and I liked them a great deal. They are talented, professional dancers, as you say. One guy after chatting with me got up and performed a quick classical ballet piece because I had asked about his background. He was really good and I made sure to tell him so. The club was just his side job. I enjoyed his quick performance way more than the dance he did while working.", "Hate 2 break it to ya, but you don\u2019t have to ask your spouse for permission to do things! She was upfront and honest about it and it seems like she had no reason to think it was going to be a big deal. She didn\u2019t hide it from him", "no. depends on the club.", "People aren\u2019t grinding and dry humping your partner at the beach though and those things happen at male strip shows so hardly the same.  I was standing talking to a friend at the end of the show when a dancer came up behind me, bent me over and motorboated my butt cheeks as I was wearing a dress.  It was my first show and it will definitely be my last.", "How should he have known she was going to the strip show before she said she was? Do you write a list of items you\u2019re uncomfortable with like:\nDon\u2019t hold hands with opposite sex\nDon\u2019t kiss the opposite sex\nDon\u2019t sleep in the same bed as the opposite sex\n\nMate \ud83d\ude02", "This is one of the most ridiculous posts I\u2019ve ever read.

Something is missing in their marriage and they have poor communication skills and/or an unreceptive partner.", "you make it sound like OP is an ahole for having different boundaries than you. He\u2019s the ahole for yelling at her and trying to control her outright instead of have a talk.", "Male strip shows are different from a female strip club. There's no groping happening because they stay on the stage.", "I, as a woman, would absolutely tell the wife the same thing. If the person is that insecure, that is on them. To try to demand a person not only does not participate in and event with their friends, but then cancel the entire trip, is insane.", "depends on the club.", "That's a strip club and strippers. When someone says \"strip show\" I take that to be a stage show like Magic Mike or Hot Guns etc", "She clearly never asked HOW HE FELT about that type of thing and just assumed he would be fine with it. You dont ask for permission to do something you do however ask if they are fine with you doing said thing.

I told her it was inappropriate and she couldn't go\u201d sounds like \u2018he was reasonable about it\u2019 to you?\n\nThat was his \\*first\\* reaction while his wife was telling him about this funny/entertaining thing she was going to do.", "Won\u2019t be able to get a lap dance?

Prospective partners *love* knowing what page we are on (literally and figuratively)", "That is true! I thought OP said, \"Strip club\" and not strip show but I double checked and see he put strip show. In that case it's wildly different.

You don't buy tickets to a strip club, you pay the entry fee at the door if you show up.\n\nOP clearly only heard strip and then lost his shit. He's clearly said he has no idea about any of it, but instead of asking for details, he treated his wife like a kid and forbid her from doing anything and then said she had to cancel the trip.

People like you are the problem", "Ok then what\u2019s the problem with a strip club if it isn\u2019t insecurity or some weird moral high ground against stripping? The fact that it\u2019s a strip club is the problem for him. So I\u2019m curious as to why he\u2019d be uncomfortable with it if it\u2019s not insecurity. If she said \u201cme and my friend got a reservation at a hot spring\u201d which might include men in tiny bathing suits enjoying it as well - would he be upset? Probably not. If she said \u201cwe got tickets to musical\u201d which might include shirtless men - would he be upset? Also probably not. If she said \u201cwe\u2019re going to a gay bar for a drag show!\u201d Would he be upset (maybe if he was Homophobic) but probably not! \nIt\u2019s the men stripping that\u2019s an issue.

Maybe he is uncomfortable about the actions performed by those male strippers against his partner. But your totally right he is just insecure about another man potentially grinding against his wife", "Yeah depending on the night, who's there, if a particular dj is playing. Not all strip clubs though but the popular ones you have to. And surprisingly messy shit only happens at the popular ones. Complete opposite of female strip clubs", "Interesting \ud83e\udd23"]}
