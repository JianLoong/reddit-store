We've been together for just over 20 years, married for 16, and have 2 children, 14 and 10. \n\nNever once in the 20 years we've been together was anything like this discussed, agreed upon, or done. Never did either of us said this kind of thing was okay to do, and I don't know where she got that idea from. \n\nA couple days ago, my wife came up to me and talked about a \"trip\" she's going on. I already knew this trip was happening, it's been planned for a while. She's basically staying in a hotel with one of her girl friends for a week. \n\nBut now all of a sudden she said that her friend bought tickets to a male strip show. Which was never discussed prior and was suddenly put on my just the other day. \n\nShe said her friend bought her and my wife both tickets to go to a bar and watch a male strip show together. She didn't come to me asking if it was alright, she just said \"we bought the tickets and we're going.\" \n\nShe was laughing and acting like everything was just fine. Even though I've never indicated I'm comfortable with that kind of thing. \n\nI personally think it's a super inappropriate thing for a married woman to do, especially without asking prior to buying tickets. \n\nWell long story short I yelled at her and told her I wasn't okay with it. I told her it was inappropriate and she couldn't go. She got super upset with me and said that I'm being controlling and I should \"let her have fun.\" \n\nHer (almost) exact words were \"wow, I thought you'd find it funny but now you're freaking out. It's not like I'm having sex with someone else. I'm an adult I can do what I want.\" \n\nToday I told her I don't want her going on the trip with that friend at all, and if she does she needs to cancel the tickets and promise me she won't go to the bar. But she refused to promise anything and yelled at me for being \"a jerk\" in front of our kids. \n\nAITA for telling her not to go and getting mad?\n\nEdit: thanks for the input so far. I agree yelling was an overreaction. It's just not something I'm comfortable with in our relationship, but I shouldn't get that mad and I should just explain myself calmly. I realize I was wrong for that.", "created_utc": 1667702756, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ynel9u/aita_for_not_letting_my_wife_go_out_with_her/", "score": 194, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Then she should have been able to express her thoughts/feelings on the issue. Then you could each state your boundaries based on your feelings. \n\nYou are allowed to state that, to you, attending the show would cross a boundary and that it would be a dealbreaker for you.

That's part of being married. \n\nWhen you promise to be with someone for the rest of your life, it comes along with a lot of emotional responsibilities. You are SUPPOSED to care if something is making your partner uncomfortable. There should be no reason a married, momogamous person needs to go to a strip show no matter the genders. Go to a concert ffs.\n\nEdit: soft yta for yelling, I understand this is very frustrating but we can communicate like adults", "NTA OP.

You yelling certainly didn't help your case here.\n\nFor the record I'm on your side of the fence here, I think it's inappropriate. But you should talk to her calmly, apologize for yelling, explain that you are not comfortable with this and ask, not tell, her to please value your opinion on this matter. Hopefully not upsetting you is more important than seeing some strippers.", "Why the fuck are y'all giving him shit for having boundaries as that doesn't make him insecure or mean he doesn't trust her.

She's not your property or child. She can decide what she wants to do and where she wants to go. Even if it may risk the marriage. \n\nYou both need to work on your communication skills. Yelling doesn't get points across it just gets loud. You both need to sit down and talk.", "ESH. Your yelling was childish and very immature communication for someone who has been with someone for 20 years, it is controlling and abusive to say she can't go at all. Saying that, your boundary about her not going to see male strippers is fair, it's just the way you communicated that was not. She is an adult who can do what she wants, you can't stop her.

She is absolutely right that you're being controlling and that she can do what she wants.  \n\n\nHere's where she has some blame: yes, comfort level about these things should be discussed. And telling her it's something you're uncomfortable with is entirely fair. Telling her what she is and is not allowed to do with that information is not.", "YTA. She should've brought it up with you to see if you were ok with it, that would've been the better thing for sure.

That makes you the AH here.", "YTA. \u201cLetting?!\u201d Like you control her? Like you give her permission to do things? Ew.", "Ask her how she would feel about you going to the strip club with your friends, especially without her.

Your feelings are valid and worthy of a discussion, your reaction wasn\u2019t. \nAlso, forbidding a spouse(especially a woman) from doing anything is a sure way to make sure they damn well do it, even if they didn\u2019t care much before.", "ESH- you can\u2019t yell or force someone to not do something but you can set boundaries.

You have to apologize to your wife and kids. And your kids should see you apologize to your wife. Show them how to be better people.", "Info: Why are you uncomfortable with her going?\n\nThere's no nudity. It's men in speedo-like things dancing. Is she not allowed to go to the beach or a pool because that makes you uncomfortable?", "YTA\n\nYour wife doesn't need your permission or your blessing to do anything. I sense some real insecurities with you if you think her going to a strip show is a huge issue.", "ESH. You're kinda the AH for allowing YOUR insecurities to control the way she lives her life. I can see how your feelings are valid, but that doesn't make it right to try and control a grown adult. You start controlling her, she'll eventually try to find a loop hole around things, worsening the trust foundation.\n\nHere's the thing, if she wanted to cheat on you, she wouldn't have told you she was going to that bar, she would have just gone. Here's the other thing that makes her an AH. Kinda. She probably already had that planned with her friend but told you last minute cause she was scared you'd act this way. Knowing you'd act bothered, she still tells her friend yes. Bigger question here is.. Where is her change coming from? Who is this friend of hers? Something is going on with your wife for her to go against the current after so many years.\n\nI get you are trying to prevent your wife from possibly destroying the family, but everyone is right. Yelling is not the way. Her insulting you in front of the kids is not the way. Ya'll have a trust problem to fix.", "YTA\n\nI do agree you should have a discussion with your wife about what your boundaries are. I actually had this with my partner at the outset of our relationship. I'm okay with him going to gentlemen's clubs and even getting lap dances as long as he's respectful of the performers and does not engage in any form of sexual activity with them. But if you have other less permissive boundaries that's okay ... AS LONG AS YOUR WIFE AGREES TO THEM. See, the problem here is she IS an adult and while I do believe this is a conversation you should have had twenty years ago it sounds like her idea of fidelity towards you is not the same as what you want to see and you two really need to resolve it.\n\nThe part where you're definitely an asshole is twofold. 1) You yelled at her and 2) you tried to make her cancel her trip just because her friend got tickets to a strip show. That is controlling behaviour. This is your wife. You ostensibly love and trust her. You have two children with her. You can resolve this conflict in a respectful way.\n\nI advise you to \"let\" her go on this trip and accept that she may decide to go to the strip show. When she gets back have an adult conversation about what your boundaries are and what hers are. This escalated real fast so you might want to have a marriage counsellor there to make sure you both approach this in a way that doesn't do more damage.\n\nLastly, male strippers tend to be pretty cringe. You have nothing to worry about.", "First of all, unlike female strip clubs, there is no nudity in these shows.  The guys usually have Speedo\u2019s or thongs on which is something you can easily see at a public beach.\n\nSecond, you yelled at your wife and then forbid her to go?  What is she 12 or something?  Learn to have an adult conversation.\n\nLast, all you did is throw up a wall in your marriage by your attitude and reaction.  Think she is going to be honest with you the next time she plans something you may vaguely even feel uncomfortable with.  Especially if you make her cancel this one.\n\nNow, personally I would never stay married to someone as controlling as you, but since she still is, I can guarantee that you will never know what she\u2019s really doing when she goes out with the girls, since you have such tender sensibilities and want to keep her under your thumb.", "YTA - you should have had an adult conversation with your ADULT wife about how you felt instead of trying to put restrictions on her like she is your child. You\u2019ve handled this terribly. Also, you need to figure out why this is making you feel so strongly. Male strip shows are very different than female strip clubs. They are usually funny, more of a theme show.", "ESH. \n\nYou should not overreact, and it's a little bit controlling to *tell* her what to do or not do, instead of having a conversation with her about your feelings and why you feel the way you do. \n\nShe should respect your feelings and that you're not comfortable with her going to a strip club. For all those saying \"YTA\", I would guess they wouldn't be saying that as much if the genders were switched around.\n\nIf you truly want to be petty (and I do not recommend this, it's not healthy for your relationship), you could tell your wife, fine, you and a couple bros are going to get drunk and go to a strip club as well. Don't do this if you care about your relationship though.", "Do you trust your wife?  Is there good communication?  You've been together for 20 yrs so there must be trust and communication.  Being blindsided with...what!?.....strippers, but why, why are you going to \"THAT\".  I don't think your the AH for being mad or upset but YTA for yelling and telling her she can't go.  She's a responsible married adult.  Treat her as such.", "YTA - for not trusting your wife and trying to control her. Male strippers are entirely different from female strippers, it\u2019s actually more entertaining to watch the audience. Back in the \u201890\u2019s I took my mother in law to see the Chippendales, and I waved a $5 over her head so that the dancer would come over to her. He never touched her, just gyrated and winked at her, and took his tip. The look on her face was priceless! \n\nSo, after 20 years together you think she\u2019ll cheat on you with a guy half her age, who probably already has a girlfriend or wife or sugar mama? Your boundaries are prudish and you need to lighten up. It\u2019s 2022, not 1950.", "NTA - The people saying yta would say the opposite if the roles were reversed.

Does she know your boundaries? We are all allowed to have boundaries, that doesn't make you controlling. It's not fair to hold someone accountable for mistakes they didn't even know they were making though. Anyways, I'm sure a lot of people would be saying the opposite if it was a man at a strip club with his friends.", "NTA, you set your boundaries and your wife of 2 decades isn't respecting them. Had this been the other way around and you did that to your wife, everyone would be coming here to say that you're the asshole for not respecting your wife's boundaries. It's not acceptable in this sub for men to have boundaries for themselves because of the mob mentality here. Your wife could literally go fuck some other guy and people would still say that you're the asshole. This entire sub is pathetic.", "YTA. Frankly, this is outrageous. How else do you control her? Is she allowed to choose her own clothing? Her own friends? She wanted to do something and your response was to yell at her. Not cool, and your edits here don\u2019t necessarily make you look any better.", "YTA \n\nYour wife is an adult. There is no telling her what to do. Now you can say you don\u2019t want her to go, you can say it makes you uncomfortable, but you don\u2019t own her, you don\u2019t get to tell her she can\u2019t. Period. \n\nThe fact that she thought it was NBD and that you\u2019d think it would be funny shows that the vibe of your relationship was one that made her think it was okay.

Anytime there\u2019s a post like this where the situation is flipped and the woman is upset with her man for going to a strip club, redditors flock to NTA. This is simply is a reasonable boundary. She should respect that you aren\u2019t comfortable with this, even if you have been together for 20 years. \n\nYeah, you definitely shouldn\u2019t have yelled. Addressing the situation calmly would have been the right thing to do but boy is your wife acting inconsiderate.", "I don\u2019t think anyone of you is an asshole. \n\nAnyone who wants to maintain a healthy relationship should respect their partners boundaries. \nI (f27) would be totally fine with my husband (m32) going to a strip club.

If it was the other way around I would want him to respect me, right? \n\nI do however think it is important that everyone talk about their boundaries in a nice and respectful way.

We've been together for just over 20 years, married for 16, and have 2 children, 14 and 10. \n\nNever once in the 20 years we've been together was anything like this discussed, agreed upon, or done. Never did either of us said this kind of thing was okay to do, and I don't know where she got that idea from. \n\nA couple days ago, my wife came up to me and talked about a \"trip\" she's going on. I already knew this trip was happening, it's been planned for a while. She's basically staying in a hotel with one of her girl friends for a week. \n\nBut now all of a sudden she said that her friend bought tickets to a male strip show. Which was never discussed prior and was suddenly put on my just the other day. \n\nShe said her friend bought her and my wife both tickets to go to a bar and watch a male strip show together. She didn't come to me asking if it was alright, she just said \"we bought the tickets and we're going.\" \n\nShe was laughing and acting like everything was just fine. Even though I've never indicated I'm comfortable with that kind of thing. \n\nI personally think it's a super inappropriate thing for a married woman to do, especially without asking prior to buying tickets. \n\nWell long story short I yelled at her and told her I wasn't okay with it. I told her it was inappropriate and she couldn't go. She got super upset with me and said that I'm being controlling and I should \"let her have fun.\" \n\nHer (almost) exact words were \"wow, I thought you'd find it funny but now you're freaking out. It's not like I'm having sex with someone else. I'm an adult I can do what I want.\" \n\nToday I told her I don't want her going on the trip with that friend at all, and if she does she needs to cancel the tickets and promise me she won't go to the bar. But she refused to promise anything and yelled at me for being \"a jerk\" in front of our kids. \n\nAITA for telling her not to go and getting mad?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She should have talked to you first but you handled it REALLY badly. You also shot yourself in the foot because she will absolutely go now. \n\nI have been in a situation where a spouse did something I wasn\u2019t comfortable with (nothing similar to this: he posted his opinion in a way I found personally offensive). I went to him and said, \u201cCould you take this down? I know this opinion is important to you but the way you shared it is hurtful to me.\u201d\n\nHe honestly hadn\u2019t seen it from my perspective. Once he did, he took it down immediately. At no point did I forbid him from posting it. At no point did I yell. I just expressed my feelings and shared why I felt that way. \n\nPeople screw up in marriages. They do things that are thoughtless. They do things that are hurtful without realizing it. Your wife straight up told you she thought you would find it funny.

She shouldn't be entirely disregarding how uncomfortable this makes you.\n\nBut the right way to discuss boundaries in a relationship between two mature people isn't just yelling \"You're not allowed to do X.\" It's establishing expectations for how the other person will respond, and then sticking to it with your actions. e.g. \"If you go to a strip club, I would consider it the same as cheating, and expect an apology/pursue a divorce/[insert appropriate & considered reaction].\"\n\nAgain, ideally it's a conversation for long before such a trip is planned, but it's probably still a good way to set expectations and commit *yourself* to a response you think is fair, not just a knee-jerk \"no you can't\".", "Gentle YTA\nYelling is not ok, trying to forbid your adult wife from doing something is not ok.

This may or may not apply to your marriage, so disregard if you like.  It's temping to create a mirror or an equal image and say well, if she wouldn't be comfortable with me going to strip clubs, why would I be comfortable with her going to this show?  To some extent, sure, fair enough.  But let's face it, in this year of our lord 2022, sexual relationships still don't hold equal power by and large.  Women are still raised to be the ones to turn down sex.  They're raised to be afraid of it to some extent. Maybe not literally afraid, but afraid in terms of bearing the burden of the consequences.  They're (we're) raised to know that men will push and we have to say no because we will bear the consequences if we don't say no (whether social, physical or otherwise). We're raised to guard our safety when walking at night, to be careful of who hands us a drink at a bar, to have a friend know where we are at all times etc.  We live in a world where we have to be disgusted by dick pics because they aren't given with respect and reverence, but in the spirit of malice and control.\n\nIt's often not until later in life that women can really feel comfortable and in control of our sexuality.  It's possible that for your wife, being able to go to a show like that is totally liberating and - again, hear me out - will translate into more intimacy and ability to be free with you in the context of your intimate relationship.\n\nAgain, I know, downvotes, but women have a reflexively negative reaction to a dick pic or the like.  What if they had equal power and were able to celebrate that? What if that would make your relationship more amazing and electric? What if your wife is feeling more confident and comfortable and wants to have her marriage grow in great ways along with her growth? What if maybe you just talked to her about what she's getting out of it and why she wants to go and trusted her?\n\nI think the falsity of the mirror (the \"well she wouldn't want me going to strip clubs\" mirror) is that for men, gong to strip clubs (often) reinforces their power over women, or at least celebrates their power to freely have access to women.  For women, the experience may be different.  Maybe just think a bit and talk to her before reflexively shutting this down?

Equality in a relationship means veto power\nEdit : I'd like to add that any big event should be fully okay with both parties.

However, I do think a lot of people are overlooking that these shows (the male ones), are not generally held in strip clubs, they are held at mainstream venues as entertainment and humour, not just sex. So for me it would be more akin to OP going to see say Dita vin Teese perform burlesque, than going to a random strip club which is designed to try and get patrons but private dances. The former is focussing more on entertainment, the latter is about being personally sexual.", "Yeah I\u2019m a little astounded by the comments. I\u2019m a woman and not particularly comfortable with my husband going to a strip club. Before he ever went he asked me first how I\u2019d feel.

Now some people are making good points that these male strip shows are usually not the same as female, but I still think it\u2019s the right thing to do to check in with your partner before going. If you want to get uppity and call it \u201cpermission\u201d you can but it just seems like the basic of respecting your partner.
