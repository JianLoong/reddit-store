My daughter is 3 and is taller than some 5 years olds. I\u2019d be kinder to the children while holding the boundary, but agree the mom should have been paying attention. Just a reminder that us parents of 3/4 year olds gave birth right before/after Covid and it\u2019s stressful figuring out the social aspect of everything when they were sheltered for so long.", "NTA You didn't yell at him, you told him to play nice and it's rude to just take things out of other people's hands. If he got shook it's because he gets away with it and it's the first time someone said something to him. As for the mother, it's probably the first time someone corrected her child and she didn't like it. Thing is, if her child continues doing it, more people will be teaching him for her.", "NTA.  That kid is at the age where he needs to learn how to play nice, especially with younger children.  If you didn\u2019t say anything then nothing would be done to correct the behavior.  It sounds like his mom doesn\u2019t care though, which is a shame.", "NTA, you asked the child not to take things from your child. The other parent should have been more focused on their child so that they could have corrected him instead of you. \n\nAlso, are the play areas separated by age because if it is then the 4 year shouldn't be in the same area as the 17-month-old.", "NTA. It takes a village.

Her child was rude to your child and she wasn't doing anything to correct the situation.", "NTA. The other parent is not teaching their child appropriate behaviour. If they didn\u2019t want you talking to their child, they should have been more involved and guiding better behaviour.

You didn't yell at the mom, but you stood up for your kid and demonstrated good adult behavior.

I know it's your first kid but they're gonna need to build strength so letting them try and fix this themselves or at least get upset and start learning how to regulate those emotions is important. \n\nCoddled children become nightmare adults. Step back a little. Your kid will thank you.", "NTA parents are supposed to supervise their children there.

OP is NTA - parents are supposed to look out for their children", "YTA for the part where you said to the mom \u201cteach your son it\u2019s rude to snatch from others.\u201d That was uncalled for. You can enlist the other parents\u2019 help in gently correcting the other child (in fact it\u2019s desirable to do so) but you went nuclear and implied she was a bad parent with your very first words to her. That\u2019s rude and uncharitable.\n\nWhen you have a 4 yo you\u2019ll realize they need a lot of very repetitive instructing, teaching, and guidance on how to play nicely. You took what could have been a pleasant opportunity for collaborative instruction for this misbehaving 4 yo and turned it mean.", "NTA. If it wasn't his designated play area, he shouldn't be there.", "NTA you did a good job mom. If that boys mom was doing her job she would have stopped him mid throw, apologized and taken him to the appropriate age area.

It takes a village to properly raise children. Now that it\u2019s somewhat frowned upon, kids are jerks.", "YTA. Overprotective is not a good thing. You should be teaching your own child how to deal with these kind of situations. Depending on how much he is speaking you could tell him to say \"that's mine\", \"mine\" or \"no\". Simply saying 'oh he was using that ball' would have been way better too.", "NTA. Now you know why he's in the baby area though, he's differently not trust worthy enough to be in the bigger kids area alone. This is just plain old bad parenting, if you don't want another parent doing the parenting do it yourself.", "YTA- not for redirecting the behavior of the child, but how you talked to the mother and the fact you seem proud of \u201ctelling a little kid off\u201d what is that?! \n\nGet a grip, the kid is 4 which is so little. The child is still learning how to play appropriately and in a play place with lots of stimulation. \n\nFor you to call the toddler rude is ridiculous, and to tell the mom that \u201cyou will not tolerate it\u201d will not get you far in parenthood life. Once your child is at the age to make friends, if you continue with that attitude, your poor child will get excluded from play dates, birthday parties, etc because no mom/parent group will want to deal with you.", "YTA. Justified to not want another kid to be taking toys from your son, but your language was off. You don\u2019t need to \u201ctell a child off\u201d when that kid is 4 years old and has done it once before - just ask them politely and explain why. If the kid keeps doing it, then start being more strict.\n\nAsk yourself how you would feel if an adult treated your kid this way.\n\nEdit: I have a small 2 year old and have been in this situation with him and older kids a few times. Every time other than once when I\u2019ve asked nicely and explained in an age appropriate way, the kid has stopped. The one time it didn\u2019t work - that kid was a jackass with a useless parent.", "YTA. no need to make a stink about it. her kid is 4, not 14, and is also learning.  ALSO let kids play and learn social skills without hovering? Unless someone will get hurt, then it is fine to intervene.", "YTA\n\nYou don\u2019t \u201ctell off\u201d a 4 year old. Unless it\u2019s an immediate danger to your child you go to the parent and tell them what just happened and you\u2019d appreciate it if they told their child not to snatch toys from yours and throw them. \n\n\u201cTelling off\u201d or yelling at someone else\u2019s small child is not the way to handle this. A stranger yelling at the 4 year old can cause trauma to the kid just as much as the other kid snatching toys from yours. \n\nAlways go to the parent first for things like this and don\u2019t yell or talk down to the parent either. We all want to protect our kids , yes I\u2019m a father , but there are proper ways to go about it rather than yelling at someone else\u2019s child. \n\nWhen my daughter was small we had similar issues but always spoke to the parents and 9/10 there were no more issues. If it gets to be really bad then just leave vs staying & chancing more to happen. It\u2019s not ideal but if you want to protect your child then it\u2019s worth it to just leave. \n\nThere are better ways to protect your child than to yell at small kids and treat their parents like children themselves. If this small issue really gets to you then you have a rude awakening as a parent in the years to come because kids are cruel. The older they are the more cruel they can be. And believe it or not parents don\u2019t always know their kids are being cruel unless someone tells them of their behavior", "[deleted]", "YTA \n\nYou really yelled at a 4 yr old because he grabbed your sons ball?  Get over yourself. That kid is 4 and wanted to play with your son. Now you ruined that poor kids day.  I bet your son didn't even care that the other kid grabbed the ball but yet there you were, ready to yell at any kid that got close to your son. Smh.", "YTA instead of teaching this kid not to do that and reach an understanding, you just yelled at him. Now he just has a bad experience and how is that helpful for anyone? \nI do agree that that kid was being a poop, but kids don\u2019t have a good understanding of what the concept of \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d is.
