I would recommend the two of you go for marriage counseling.  And individual counseling for your wife.  It sounds like maybe there's something more going on with her but hard to say.

When I didn\u2019t have a job I did all the housework (and we shared the yard work) when I worked part time when our kid started school I still did most but hubby helped out on my work days with dishes and cooking. Now days I\u2019m working full time, the same number of hours as him, and chores are 50/50. I think you need to encourage your wife to get a job.

Shot in the dark, but if this is out of character for her, I suspect that having to do a few chores is not actually the reason she's upset. Maybe she is feeling insecure for not having a job... I don't know, but it doesn't justify her taking it out on you. You're doing more to support her than she is for you.", "Looking after a cat is stressing her out? Let\u2019s be serious.

It would be a good idea to get her into her doctor to talk about the possibility. When you're depressed and overwhelmed, it feels like everything is too much. Three years of figuring out her life and what she wants is a long time. She may be feeling guilty or useless and life may be unsatisfying for her, and she may be looking for some kind of validation.

The same way journalists will say \"18 year old man broke into...\" Versus \"Teen caught in legal battle with accuser\" and that said teen is 18. It paints different pictures subconsciously, that many folks ignore.\n\nThe way people describe and judge situations with men and women sometimes can be for the most part unbiased (all of us have bias whether we like it or not, so you can't remove it all), however I've seen many situations where gender plays a role in how men and women are treated in this sub. Very easy to say the phrase men are trash. Anyone say women are trash and they'd be eviscerated, it's such a foreign phrase, so unnatural and that in itself is testament to how gender influences perceptions and judgements. Gender shouldn't, but it does, to close your eyes and go lalalala is to ignore a problem that should be fixed, tackle it head on.\n\nI see men are often punched down on in this sub, but just as similarly I see women punched down on, on basically every other sub bc male users dominate Reddit stats.\n\nI've also seen two AITA specific born ideologies that impact male posters more than women:\n- the term \"babysitting\" being ripped to shreds and while people are all caught up in a semantics dumpster fire, they should rather just ask clarifying questions such as, what role do you take in your child's life and then judge on the actions of a person rather than how they speak. That's such a silly nominal thing to be mad about, semantics. Might as well get mad at the entire slave dominated Caribbean who all speak different versions of English and demonize us for not following language to a T\n- the sheer attacks men get when describing chores they do. I have seen people go rabid towards men asking exactly how much they make, how they're day is divided, how much chores they do, how often they do it, how bills are divided etc and while at first it seems like a great way to figure out who does what to add context, that same energy is often not applied to women. I'm glad to see it is on this post, I think we got a decent breakdown of what OPs wife does, but literally no one's asked what % of work she does, how often she does it etc. I mean majority of us are all in agreement and probably shock at OPs generous life, siding with OP. \n\n**And to your point OP is a doormat, bc based on how you describe OPs behavior as being a loving husband sure, it implies less than that isn't a loving husband. AND if OP did less than what he was currently doing, would he still be a living husband if he worked 8hr days instead of 12, or if he asked her to budget when buying things? Is he still a loving husband? Oh should be, and if being less than what OP is doing is being a loving husband than him doing extra and being treated horribly is being a doormat.

I know because I've done literally all of this between waking the 9yo up at 7am and taking her out to the bus at 7:45, with time to spare. The only reason it sometimes takes my husband longer than 30 minutes to make dinner depends on what hes making, but while hes cooking, he will also run laundry, load the dishwasher, let the dog in and out, tidy the kitchen, and more. Hell, my husband and i can work together and get the entire main floor of the house \"there are people coming over and it needs to look nice\" clean in only slightly more than an hour, and that includes sweeping and mopping the floors. Unless you're absolutely trashing the house every single day or going months at a time without cleaning, 30 minutes a day is more than enough for two people home all day long without kids.

Even still I can make a very good pesto pasta in like 15 minutes. I don't count waiting for the water to boil as actual work. The rest of the chores are very basic. I have more than one cat, it takes like 5 minutes to clean their litter and replace their food/water bowls. Also, they live in an apartment which is similar to my living situation. You don't need to clean the place everyday. That's not living in filth. And when you do need to clean, it takes no time at all.

My point being that you can accomplish a lot in 30 minutes if your house isn't an absolute shit show. The relevance is, I have 2 kids and I can accomplish at minimum a dozen things in 30 minutes in the way of house chores, before I also go to work. \n\nThe relevance is, no more than 30 minutes is usually needed because we pick up here and there as we go instead of leaving things sit, ie we take our dishes to the kitchen instead of leaving them in the livingroom or putting dorty clothes in a basket as we take them off instead of just throwinf them on the floor, which isnt a \"chore\" its being responsible. That way when its time to do the chore itself, such as washing the dishes - they are already in the kitchen to be washed or loaded into the dishwasher, which saves time because then you dont have to go around gathering them up. Same with laundry.\n\nThis woman has no job and can do whatever she wants in an apartment with no kids and she's complaining about a list of chores that it would take me maybe 20 minutes if it was just me and my husband and no kids.\n\nFFS when I had to live with my mom after my divorce from my first husband and it was me doing 90% of the cleaning in a house of EIGHT PEOPLE, three cats, and a dog, it still took me maybe only an hour and a half to do the basic every-other-day cleaning, which was on top working, going to college online, and having a 3yo. If we were having an event and I was \"deep cleaning\" the entire downstairs, it took maybe 3ish hours to do the livingroom, both bathrooms, the kitchen, dining room, and laundry. \n\nThe relevance is, in a house with 2 kids and a dog, in a single 24 hour day that I'm not working, I bet I can do, and actually do, more than this woman does in a week as far as house work goes.\n\nThe relevance is you don't actually need to clean every single fn day, if you already just keep your home clean to begin with...", "Well laundry takes longer cuz it needs the machine to do it but actually loading it is quick.

Not sure if you\u2019re just humblebragging.", "Dishes after cooking aren\u2019t quick.\n\nMeal prep definitely isn\u2019t quick. \n\nLaundry needs to be organized into piles, hanged out to dry if you don\u2019t have a dryer, ironed and folded. That is a lot more work than just putting it in and out of the washer, and this is how I know someone does your laundry for you.\n\nAnd you do realize that there are MANY tasks that you don\u2019t do every day, right?
