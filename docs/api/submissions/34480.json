Very easy to say the phrase men are trash. Anyone say women are trash and they'd be eviscerated, it's such a foreign phrase, so unnatural and that in itself is testament to how gender influences perceptions and judgements.

I have seen people go rabid towards men asking exactly how much they make, how they're day is divided, how much chores they do, how often they do it, how bills are divided etc and while at first it seems like a great way to figure out who does what to add context, that same energy is often not applied to women.

Is he still a loving husband? Oh should be, and if being less than what OP is doing is being a loving husband than him doing extra and being treated horribly is being a doormat.

I know because I've done literally all of this between waking the 9yo up at 7am and taking her out to the bus at 7:45, with time to spare. The only reason it sometimes takes my husband longer than 30 minutes to make dinner depends on what hes making, but while hes cooking, he will also run laundry, load the dishwasher, let the dog in and out, tidy the kitchen, and more. Hell, my husband and i can work together and get the entire main floor of the house \"there are people coming over and it needs to look nice\" clean in only slightly more than an hour, and that includes sweeping and mopping the floors.

The relevance is, I have 2 kids and I can accomplish at minimum a dozen things in 30 minutes in the way of house chores, before I also go to work. \n\nThe relevance is, no more than 30 minutes is usually needed because we pick up here and there as we go instead of leaving things sit, ie we take our dishes to the kitchen instead of leaving them in the livingroom or putting dorty clothes in a basket as we take them off instead of just throwinf them on the floor, which isnt a \"chore\" its being responsible.

You haven\u2019t delineated money either which is pretty good of you tbh. It does sound like she has a whole lot of freedom for what *may* be a pretty low price. It does sound like the rules of engagement, so to speak, changed when she left law school and a conversation needed to happen about what the two of you expect from one another, fairness etc. \n\n\nI really don\u2019t want to devalue the effort involved in domestic labour and with posts like these I think everyone (poster and commenters) need to be very thoughtful about how we talk about it. Society in general find it work enough to play cleaners to clean our homes, we pay extra to eat out when our meals are cooked for us (or arrive pre cooked), we pay when we take our clothes to a laundromat- more when it\u2019s a person washing them for us rather than a coin op. We know that if we tried to pay SAH wives and mothers for the labour they do in equivalent salaries for the combined roles it would be a 6 figure job. \n\nThe two of you need to sit down and work out what is fair. I don\u2019t know from your post just how thoroughly, often or deeply she cleans, if she keeps a running schedule of what is due for deep cleaning, and if she\u2019s truly managing a household. It may really not be much when chalked up to your 12h shifts but you two need to agree on what is balanced and what isn\u2019t. It may be that neither of you quite knows just how much the other contributes. I don\u2019t believe relationships are strictly transactional but they do need to be mutually supportive and for some reason she doesn\u2019t feel that way. It might be an overstatement or overreaction on her part or it may be that she doesn\u2019t understand how taxing your job is I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s a conversation you need to have", "Calling this fake. New profile, no replies", "Pick me! \ud83d\udd90\ufe0f I\u2019ll be OP\u2019s wife! Sounds like a *dream.*", "It sounds like she may have some mental health issues to resolve and get help.  It is so hard to be productive and find a path when you are mentally unwell.  She may need help getting help.", "This right here. This is the best response.\n\nNo kids, no home ownership, and no fucking job and she has the gall to bitch about cleaning up around an apartment? That\u2019s not a partner, that\u2019s a parasite.", "I don\u2019t think your an asshole like if one my girl friends said this to us about her husband we would all look at her crazy. We would say that\u2019s a useless ass man and she needs to do better. \n\nThere is no fucking way you dropped out of college and haven\u2019t done a single thing in 3 years, except get married.", "You\u2019re definitely not the ah. 3 years of whining and crying with no job about doing dishes and feeding the cat? I\u2019d only give her that 3rd option, forget the first two", "This a million times over. OP NTA, but she is seriously leeching off you. What would you say to a friend who has this relationship? Sorry, but this isn't a companion for life.", "Right? QUICKLY divorce so the alimony is short.", "Agreed", "Yeah, OP needs to wake up. He's not getting anything out of this relationship. If she left, he could feed the cat and wash his own dishes. And she doesn't even APPRECIATE her position. Like, OP, end things. One day you're going to look back and regret this wasted time.", "Yeah, OP needs to wake up. He's not getting anything out of this relationship.

Late 20s means probably less than five, but definitely less than ten. The average age for marriage in America is between 25 and 30. IIRC if you've been married less than twenty you can only get alimony for 50% of the time you were married. So if you were married ten years, you can only get alimony for five. I believe they also take how long she's been out of the workforce and her capability for rejoining it into consideration. If they've been married for less than five years she is almost certainly guaranteed to get denied alimony.", "I would like to know this as well. 3+ years on someone else's dime definitely seems like more than enough time to \"find\" yourself. Few people are ever afforded such a luxury. I suspect that over this long time the inequality in the relationship - which tilts strongly in her favor already - has just become a new normal for her, to where she takes it for granted and no longer sees it.", "This! I bet a lot of the problem arises bc OP works from home. So from inside wife's head, it feels like he's \"around\" as much as she is, but doing less than the modest amount she probably has to do to keep an child-free apartment tidy and take care of a cat. But this perspective is only possible because she isn't actually \"there\" for the 12hrs of WORK the OP is doing daily on the computer to bring in an actual income.\r  \n\r  \nI love the cleaning service idea too. I mean, it sounds like money isn't much a problem for OP... after all, he already can afford to support two adults. (And if the money is an issue, then just deduct it from wife's allowance.) Problem solved! Now neither of you has to clean the place.

I agree that it seems there's an underlying issue though", "Worse.
