He was in poor health for the past few years so it didn't exactly come as a surprise but still sad nonetheless.  He and I used to be very close when I was growing up, he was my hero.  It was because of my admiration for him that I was blind to a lot of his faults and it wasn't until I was in my mid 20s that I realized how much of a flawed human being he truly was.  His stubbornness to see his own flaws and address how they impacted those around him led to our relationship becoming more and more strained as the years went on.\n\nAs the oldest of 3 siblings, I was asked to give the eulogy at his funeral.  I agreed, but told my family that I would not be giving a sugar-coated speech and that I would address his character in totality.  None of my siblings nor my mother voiced any disapproval at this.  \n\nMy father was a successful businessman and was married to my mother for 49 years.  He raised 3 children, all of whom have gone on to have successful careers, marriage, and children.  He was also an extremely capable DIYer and with the help of myself and my younger brother, remodeled a lakefront cabin to become my parents' dream retirement home.  I included all of this in my eulogy, in fact, I led with it.  \n\nBut, I also addressed his many flaws.  He was a self-admitted highly-functioning alcoholic.  His health problems later in life were a direct result of his years of drinking.  It also impacted his relationship with myself and my siblings as he refused to address his drinking problems and resulted in all of us reducing contact with him over the years because we did not want to expose our own children to his drinking.  \n\nI used a lot of levity when addressing my father's flaws and made sure to drive home the good aspects of his life as well as the bad.  But I didn't want to give a pandering speech that overlooked the aspects of my father's life that caused conflict and pain with those close to him.  No one in the room when I was giving the speech was unaware of my dad's failings, so it wasn't like I was giving new, shocking information of the deceased.  \n\nAt our family Xmas this year, I got a lot of flack from relatives about the speech I gave because I \"made my dad look bad.\"  I was told I was a horrible son and that I tarnished the memory of my father for a lot of people.  My dad's 2 sisters were the most vocal about this and they definitely had some strong words for me.\n\nThankfully, my mom and siblings (whose opinions I care about more than others) were supportive and glad that I spoke about my father as the unique and flawed person he was.  But the words of other relatives who I care about still stung and left me wondering if I overstepped by eulogizing my father the way I did.", "created_utc": 1672338142, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zyc9jh/aita_for_giving_an_honest_eulogy_at_my_fathers/", "score": 265, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He did a terrific job and he included the whole person, flaws, good moments, etc. He even snuck in a veiled reference to how much my father criticized his oldest daughter (moi), which I enjoyed.\n\nDid your relatives want authenticity or did they want bullshit?

Funeral attendees don't want to hear the truth. \"Don't speak ill of the dead.\"\n\nMy mother was abusive.

It seems more like a difference of opinion.", "NTA.  It does not sound like you gave the kind of eulogy that is making the viral social media rounds these days.  It sounds like, as you said, you discussed all the good, but did not give a \"pandering speech\" that tried to ignore or rewrite history.

A few comedians have brought to light this idea of glorifying flawed people upon their death. The truth of the matter is that we are complicated beings. With so many factors in the variables it can be just anyone thing or combination of things. Complicated nonetheless. We need to normalize honesty at a funeral. The idea of what should and shouldn\u2019t be said- is a slap in the face to those who endured pain at the hands of the deceased.", "NTA\n\nA friend recently talked about a cousin's funeral.  The cousin had left his wife and two young children for another woman who he soon married.  At his funeral, one of the man's stepdaughters got up and gave a magnificent eulogy.  She talked about all the wonderful things he had done for her growing up and how he had stepped in to be the father figure that had been missing in her life.  The problem was, sitting right there in the front row, were his two now adult children who didn't have a dad in their life because he had left them to be a father to the young woman who was speaking.  My friend said that her second cousins really struggled through the service because it was so hard to hear that he loved and cared for his stepchildren in a way he never did his own.\n\nPeople have different perspectives given their closeness to the person.  Your relationship with your father was very different from the relationship your aunts had with him.  You got to see his flaws up close and personal, and I imagine those flaws (his alcoholism) had some real negative consequences on your life.  Simply focusing on the that which is glowingly positive is not honest, and, in the example I provided above, can create further hurt.  Your mom and your siblings approved of your message and that is all that matters.", "NTA- who are they (his sisters) to tell you what your truth is?", "YTA. A eulogy is not time to trash somebody.

You don't have to sugar coat or lie about someone but you could have chose to just State facts, they were a father to this person and Uncle to this person and share a fond memory from your childhood.  \n\nFor your own healing you could have written in a journal about his alcoholism or spoken in front of an audience of just your immediate family if it helps you in your healing", "NTA.  Given that you included the positives and used humor, I don\u2019t see anything wrong with being real about the person.  Since  your mother and siblings approved, it sounds like it was not overly harsh or unrealistically negative.  People who want to have a fake angelic image of perfection will be bothered by it.  Those people are most likely part of the problem in a family with alcoholism, but they are entitled to their opinion.", "NTA, I always am very suspicious of eulogies that are all sunshine and light. No one is without faults. We would all do better to remember that and not deny/omit them. Improve and change? Sure. But it always grinds my gears when people are placed up on a pedestal (especially famous/historical figures). You never know who might be helped by hearing about someone else that also had flaws and fucked up sometimes. You're a good son and a good person.", "NTA. If people don't want others to speak ill of the dead, the dead should have acted better when they were alive. I sense that you still love your father, and honestly, I feel like it would have been a disservice to paint him as a man that he wasn't.", "NTA,  no one is perfect. I seriously don't get why eulogies are supposed to make it sound like they were. They were real people who will be missed for different reasons by different people based on their personal experiences.  My siblings and I have had many conversations about how we remember our parents so differently.  (Big age gaps between the siblings so our parents really were different people with different life experiences for us.)", "YTA. The OP\u2019s father\u2019s relatives are right, the OP was a horrible son.", "info- what extactly did you say? how did you do it? did you said \u2018despite his flaws. he was good. blah blah\u2019 of \u2018he was an alchoolic, ect\u2019", "YTA. He is dead, why shit on him?", "YTA", "\u201chis stubbornness to see his own faults\u201d seems to be a trait he passed on to you.\nWhy the need to call him out during his funeral? A funeral is for the living and those in attendance knew his faults but wanted to think the best and why not? It\u2019s not court. You don\u2019t have to tell the whole truth.", "NTA. My dad gave a very similar eulogy for my grandfather, acknowledging his accomplishments and flaws.", "[removed]", "Was looking for this comment! Loved the series, really should reread it.", "This is so on point. When my mother died, her former coworkers (doctors and nurses) were effusive in her praise, all about how wonderful she was with patients. As her children, this was not the experience we had. She was verbally abusive, mentally abusive, and financially abusive - all three of us have self esteem problems from years of this abuse. It was all I could do to grind my teeth and bite my lip and keep quiet. It wasn't that we didn't love her, but we saw the entire woman, flaws and all. Everyone else say only half a portrait.", "Very sensible, I agree with this.", "\u201cI am here as a fellow human to acknowledge that Lester has, you know, passed on.\u201d", "Agree.  If someone wants a sugar-coated eulogy at their funeral, then they should live that way.", "OP didnt trash him though. OP gave an honest speech about who his father really was, emphasising the good, but not glossing over the bad. Honestly, as it should be. Sounds like a good eulogy.", "Speak for yourself.  OP is NTA.", "What is airing grievances about telling people were like. He told them it would not be sugar coated. They are upset that they didn't get the traditional eulogy. The one that is my friend/relative is fantastic and everyone loved him/her.", "I disagree. If the OP is an alcoholic or abusive, and has a strained relationship with their children, then maybe you would have a point. I see no harm in being 100% honest about who a person was. That includes their flaws. My husband's grandmother was a pill! She did everything she could to rob the spotlight. She also often said some truly horrible things to people for no reason at all. We ALL got our fair dose of her, but none more so than my wonderful MIL. She's a Saint that took excellent care of her mother even when her mother was down right wretched. It was not a shock when grandmother's attitude was mentioned. We all giggled because we all KNEW exactly who she was. That's not to say that she didn't have some good traits. She did. We were all simply glad that MIL was honest about grandmother and how she could be. It was too big of a thing to try to simply sweep it aside like it wasn't part of who she was.", "Exactly. And the end of the day we\u2019re all human beings and as from dust we come and to dust we return. We deserve a good welcome and send off in this world. Our loved ones deserve to remember us kindly. OP should have refused the speech if this was their intent.", "Ive \"attended\" probably 500 funerals through my job as a  organ player. \n\nThe unborn, the centenarians, the social butterflies, the lonesomes, the healthy, the ill, the drawn out deaths, the sudden ones, the abused and the well loved ones, those who did good and those who did evil.\n\nI most certainly can hear the truth behind all those words that have been spoken,  and it really rubs me the wrong way when things are concealed. Like the mother and wife, whose peak achievement seemed to be baking cookies - and whose death likely was hastened by the abuse she suffered at her husbands hands, or the severely disabled young man whose funeral was only attended by the workers of his institution.\n\nIn my opinion, the truth is better than whitewashing, even at a funeral. If we only share the socially acceptable,  we continue to gaslight anyone, who has the brains to see the whole picture.\nMy sons lost their father 2 years ago, and there were 7 parties all interested in being part of the funeral (I chose one hymn, and kept away otherwise), and what made its way into the eulogy was a jumbled mess of everyones good intentions and perceptions of  him. Not the truth, not something his (very young) children could take forward, just a caleidoscopic image of positive snippets.\n\nWhat use was that? None. Good for nobody. A truthfull story highlighting the positive would have been comforting, and reminded everybody, that there is beauty in everything.\n\nI, too, was brought up to say only good about the dead, but that is only good for the dead, and they dont care anymore.", "Funerals are a time to share memories and the life that was lived. Full stop. Your social pressures might\u2019ve told you it\u2019s a celebration of life but that\u2019s ur view. People are crying and everybody\u2019s mourning their own loss. Speaking honestly of YOUR individual loss is all that can be done. All honesty is valid. And all humans are flawed, accepting and relishing in their life despite their flaws is as good as it gets in this life. Funerals are for grief don\u2019t invalidate others grief.", "u/Ibecciun8678 stole this partial comment from: /u/lestatisalive \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zyc9jh/aita_for_giving_an_honest_eulogy_at_my_fathers/j25273r/\n\nBot Reported.", "Best thing Willa will ever write. \ud83d\ude09", "I\u2019d love to write my own eulogy for the newspaper. It would be a hoot. And truthful.", "Can i just say you organ players on gods, how tf you handle all those pedals and keys holy fuck", "It doesn\u2019t have to be a celebration but at the end of the day dignity of all our lives deserve to be honoured. OP would not accept an invite to speak at his birthday and say this so why is it acceptable at his funeral. Funerals are an occasion to celebrate and commemorate life. If you don\u2019t want to. You don\u2019t attend."]}
