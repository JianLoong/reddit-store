He was in poor health for the past few years so it didn't exactly come as a surprise but still sad nonetheless.  He and I used to be very close when I was growing up, he was my hero.  It was because of my admiration for him that I was blind to a lot of his faults and it wasn't until I was in my mid 20s that I realized how much of a flawed human being he truly was.  His stubbornness to see his own flaws and address how they impacted those around him led to our relationship becoming more and more strained as the years went on.\n\nAs the oldest of 3 siblings, I was asked to give the eulogy at his funeral.  I agreed, but told my family that I would not be giving a sugar-coated speech and that I would address his character in totality.  None of my siblings nor my mother voiced any disapproval at this.  \n\nMy father was a successful businessman and was married to my mother for 49 years.  He raised 3 children, all of whom have gone on to have successful careers, marriage, and children.  He was also an extremely capable DIYer and with the help of myself and my younger brother, remodeled a lakefront cabin to become my parents' dream retirement home.  I included all of this in my eulogy, in fact, I led with it.  \n\nBut, I also addressed his many flaws.  He was a self-admitted highly-functioning alcoholic.  His health problems later in life were a direct result of his years of drinking.  It also impacted his relationship with myself and my siblings as he refused to address his drinking problems and resulted in all of us reducing contact with him over the years because we did not want to expose our own children to his drinking.  \n\nI used a lot of levity when addressing my father's flaws and made sure to drive home the good aspects of his life as well as the bad.  But I didn't want to give a pandering speech that overlooked the aspects of my father's life that caused conflict and pain with those close to him.  No one in the room when I was giving the speech was unaware of my dad's failings, so it wasn't like I was giving new, shocking information of the deceased.  \n\nAt our family Xmas this year, I got a lot of flack from relatives about the speech I gave because I \"made my dad look bad.\"  I was told I was a horrible son and that I tarnished the memory of my father for a lot of people.  My dad's 2 sisters were the most vocal about this and they definitely had some strong words for me.\n\nThankfully, my mom and siblings (whose opinions I care about more than others) were supportive and glad that I spoke about my father as the unique and flawed person he was.  But the words of other relatives who I care about still stung and left me wondering if I overstepped by eulogizing my father the way I did.", "created_utc": 1672338142, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zyc9jh/aita_for_giving_an_honest_eulogy_at_my_fathers/", "score": 1141, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He did a terrific job and he included the whole person, flaws, good moments, etc. He even snuck in a veiled reference to how much my father criticized his oldest daughter (moi), which I enjoyed.\n\nDid your relatives want authenticity or did they want bullshit?

Funeral attendees don't want to hear the truth. \"Don't speak ill of the dead.\"\n\nMy mother was abusive. When she died, we (her children, dad had already passed) decided not to have a funeral for that reason. We did NOT want to listen to someone talk about her as if she were mother of the century or how much she loved her kids. \nInstead, we opted for an invitation only graveside service.

It seems more like a difference of opinion.", "NTA.  It does not sound like you gave the kind of eulogy that is making the viral social media rounds these days.  It sounds like, as you said, you discussed all the good, but did not give a \"pandering speech\" that tried to ignore or rewrite history.

A few comedians have brought to light this idea of glorifying flawed people upon their death. The truth of the matter is that we are complicated beings. With so many factors in the variables it can be just anyone thing or combination of things. Complicated nonetheless. We need to normalize honesty at a funeral. The idea of what should and shouldn\u2019t be said- is a slap in the face to those who endured pain at the hands of the deceased.", "NTA\n\nA friend recently talked about a cousin's funeral.  The cousin had left his wife and two young children for another woman who he soon married.  At his funeral, one of the man's stepdaughters got up and gave a magnificent eulogy.  She talked about all the wonderful things he had done for her growing up and how he had stepped in to be the father figure that had been missing in her life.  The problem was, sitting right there in the front row, were his two now adult children who didn't have a dad in their life because he had left them to be a father to the young woman who was speaking.  My friend said that her second cousins really struggled through the service because it was so hard to hear that he loved and cared for his stepchildren in a way he never did his own.\n\nPeople have different perspectives given their closeness to the person.  Your relationship with your father was very different from the relationship your aunts had with him.  You got to see his flaws up close and personal, and I imagine those flaws (his alcoholism) had some real negative consequences on your life.  Simply focusing on the that which is glowingly positive is not honest, and, in the example I provided above, can create further hurt.

You did alright, you told it how it was and if people can't accept it then they need to deal with it and their own problems.", "NTA.\n\nSometimes it's good to get these things out into the open, and apparently your close family agrees. Personally I don't quite understand the expected idolization of the deceased; they were whole persons, not just their best parts. It's possible to have real love for flawed people.", "NTA no one even spoke at my FIL\u2019s funeral bc no one liked the man. That speaks volumes.", "YTA\n\nWould you want people taking an inventory of your flaws at your funeral? \n\nIf everyone there was aware of it, why did you feel the need to bring up his alcoholism? \n\nOther people are the A-H too, for having this stupid tradition surrounding having the oldest serve in certain positions of honor, responsibility or power. They should have picked the one who would have given the most loving and caring eulogy. \n\nI hope one day you get the eulogy you deserve.", "NTA - I am so sorry for your loss, and for the reaction to your eulogy. You write with intelligence and sensitivity, painting a full picture of an interesting and flawed human. I have no doubt that your eulogy was just as well and sensitively written, a belief supported by your mum and siblings\u2019 reactions to it. Some people feel that at a funeral you don\u2019t speak ill of the dead, and I drew criticism for some of the ways I spoke about my mum at her funeral. Personally, I feel like a funeral is for the living - to remember the person who passed, to hear reflections on them, and to share our memories and stories. If you can\u2019t give a full picture and speak your truth about your dad there, when you are giving his eulogy and with the support of his wife and other children, when can you. \n\nNTA *hugs* you sound like a good person to me.", "NTA, speaker for the dead.", "YTA. A funeral is for the living. The purpose is to bring peace and cloure for the dead's loved ones. \n\nIt's not the place to express grievances. You say nice things to make everyone present feel more at peace", "NTA. The dead don\u2019t care. If there\u2019s no afterlife, they don\u2019t care. If they\u2019re in Heaven, they don\u2019t care because they\u2019re in Heaven. If they\u2019re in Hell, they don\u2019t care because they\u2019re in Hell.

Addressing those flaws along with his qualities allowed everyone who heard your eulogy to also come to terms with their complicated feelings upon his passing. You did a service. Please do not feel bad. It was your eulogy to give, and you did not overstep. You also did not \"make him look bad\". Everyone in the room also knew who he was, so you weren't telling them something they didn't already know.\n\nIt's such a difficult task, and one that is easier to criticize than it is to craft. I could not manage to write even my mother's obituary when she passed. Feel proud that you have given a fitting tribute to your father, as only you could do.", "NTA, no one is perfect. I have been to many, many funerals in my life. Some of the best funeral eulogies I have listened to was real on the good and bad of life. Some of the not so good was for people who were not in real life at all like the eulogy presented. One case in point was for my friends estranged dad, his aunt the deceased sister gave the eulogy and she went way overboard of what a wonderful father he was and how much he loved his kids and thought about them every day. When all of us in attendance knew he left them all when they were toddlers and barely kept contact with any of them until the last couple years of his life. It made a mockery of the family and the survived", "NTA.  You spoke your truth from your heart.  Ignore the haters.

Your honesty was needed", "YTA. That\u2019s not the time or place to vent your feelings about your father. This speech was solely for you, it was a selfish display that marred your father on a day that\u2019s supposed to be about remembering the good of someone. It\u2019s a day to celebrate their life. It\u2019s not a day for you to address your issues. You made your family uncomfortable and you made it about you.", "I don't know if I'd call you an A/H. This is the reason I'm not attending my mother's funeral next year. She wasn't just flawed; she was vicious and abusive. She gave me childhood PTSD. I wouldn't be able to attend without letting my true feelings slip out. But I don't think there's anything wrong with telling the truth, as long as it's balanced. You might have considered the other relatives' feelings before being so honest, though. So....no judgment at this time.", "ESH - Alcoholic dads often had an alcoholic parent themselves.  You shook a hornet's nest that might have involved a lot of serious pain to a lot of people.  On the other hand, it might have been long overdue that these relatives needed a wake up call.  If your motive was to sow discord and hatred that will eventually work against you.  If your motive was to break through denial and create the beginning of healing that will eventually work in your favor.  Either way, the old farts are going to have to get over it.  When they are all dead and gone I bet some of their children will say they admired what you did (even if your words were not carefully chosen enough.)", "NTA\n\nThe thing is that funerals are for the living. You make it more about yourself. To a degree it's like you're finally getting even by exposing them without their interruption  Everyone had their own experiences with the deceased. A eulogy given by one person won't always speak for the whole room. The only way you'd been an ass is if you wanted to stir shit hoping it would hit someone else in the room other than the deceased.

Your aunts\u2019 and other secondary relations\u2019 opinions aren\u2019t relevant as they didn\u2019t live with him for half a century.

Sounds to me like you did just fine by your father, his primary family, and yourself.", "NTA\n \nIt sounds like you gave a eulogy to be proud of, honestly.  My guess is that he may have been honored that despite his flaws you still described him as accomplished and having been your hero.  That means his positives were tremendous and he raised you well enough to reduce contact so your kids wouldn\u2019t suffer from any of his negatives.  Your aunts have no reason to croticize you.", "NAH.  \nYour speech was truthful, and I respect you for not sugar-coating it. Not to mention you got approval from the people closest to him, so thats good.  \n\n\nI can also understand people not wanting to hear about the major flaws at that time period, which is also understandable.

I mean I get gossiping among relatives but at least have the decency to understand how the family in question feels before acting on it in anyway", "Going to have to go with YTA. Although your father was flawed , his eulogy should focus on the positive in his life. Calling out his alcoholism and other flaws was low. All of us are flawed. I understand that it affected all of your lives but if it was your eulogy would you want the same? Someone up there detailing all of your human flaws? I would not. Your relatives have a very valid point. Water under the bridge. You can\u2019t take it back.", "When I die, I would want my survivors to tell the truth about me. I want each person to remember me as I was to them, because any other memory is fake and would be the same as not remembering me at all. NTA.", "YTA for pissing on your father's grave. If pointing out his faults was that important to you, you shouldn't have given the eulogy. Eulogies are traditionally to highlight the positive things the decedent had done with his life. It would have been different if you had talked about his faults first then ended on a positive note rather than start with the good and conclude with everything that made him a dick. Your post reads like you shit all over him at his funeral because you didn't have the guts to stand up to him when he was alive.", "YTA, a eulogy isn't the time to complain about or insult the deceased!", "NTA, told the truth\u2026.it\u2019s what people needed to hear, not honey-dripping crap", "NTA.

They can hardly walk.  Alcohol consumes them.  Hard to watch this person that taught me to hunt and fish drink himself into a hollow shell of the person he used to be.  I don't blame you.  You have an overview of the whole person.  We are not without faults.  The good and the bad encompass ones life.", "NTA.\n\nMy dad and his sister did a honest eulogy of his mom a few months ago, and it was very emotional and beautiful. My grandpa loved it. I think grandma must have been happy as well. So, job well-done! You did what was right by you, and it seems your mom and siblings! Ultimately, this was the way to honor him that was meaningful to you, and what's best than a meaningful speech?", "NTA - being dead doesn't make you a saint. You didn't hurt your mom or siblings, everyone else can sit and spin.", "NTA just because a person is dead does not mean they were saints when they were alive. You just gave a accurate description of he was when he was alive and didn\u2019t lie. You gave both the pros and cons of his deeds while trying to be considerate as you could be.", "NTA Your grief, your relationship, your right to mourn however you like. I hope that you were tactful though. At my uncle\u2019s funeral, we referred to him as being \u201ca difficult person, someone with whom we lost touch over the years due to his foibles\u201d and \u201cwe mourn his passing because we like to remember his good characteristics whilst acknowledging the more difficult aspects to him\u201d.", "YTA - funerals are not for the living. You\u2019ve had a lifetime to hash out these issues, and another lifetime to discuss these flaws with the rest of your family outside of the funeral. Using this funeral as a platform to vocalise all your supposed discontents with your father is inappropriate, immature, and selfish. This funeral isn\u2019t for you specifically - it\u2019s to celebrate and mourn a life. I\u2019ve had many relatives of mine with less than savoury lifestyles who have died young due to these issues but no one used their funerals as an excuse to punch down on a dead person despite any hurts committed. With all the love in the world, as I know it\u2019s a very difficult time, in the kindest way possible, get over yourself.", "YTA. Funerals are for the living but it\u2019s safe to say that people were there because they loved him, they didn\u2019t want to hear you air your grievances, that\u2019s what therapy is for.

You knew it would be upsetting for other loved ones or you wouldn't have asked.", "Yeah, YTA.  Eulogies should be short and sweet, and given by someone who isn't going to include a list of the deceased's faults.  Guessing your speech made a lot of people uncomfortable, and funerals are sad enough without making them uncomfortable, too.", "As a fellow child of a highly functioning alcoholic, I very much identified with how you felt about your dad.; it mirrors much of my experience. My father passed when I was 22, and our relationship was complex.\n\nThat said, I don't believe you did the right thing. I'm not rendering a judgement, but I don't think a eulogy is the time to explore your deeper feelings about the deceased. Amongst your immediate family, over dinner, at a wake, wherever. But not in front of a crowd of people who may or may not have known your father well. However you meant it, the comments on his drinking overshadowed everything else, and I don't think it was the place to express those thoughts. I'm sorry for your loss.", "I mean, did you actually really accomplish anything? I get that parents are flawed individuals and we only realize it once we get older. But by all accounts, everything you have achieved is because of this man that you chose to speak ill of at his funeral. I get that he hurt you, but at the end of the day, I don\u2019t think you accomplished anything other than shit talking someone who couldn\u2019t respond or defend themselves. People are flawed. Learn to get over it and move past things. I\u2019m sure if you have kids who will realize that about you as well eventually. YTA.", "I agree. When my mom died, the eulogy was kind, but no family members shied away from telling the stories involving her insanity and alcoholism amongst themselves. She was abusive, and I think I would have gone crazy if people were only allowed to say good things about her. It made me deeply uncomfortable to fake sadness to others (mostly non family members) who sobbed to me about her death when I was only relieved. It took me months to even think of a good memory about her, and I don\u2019t know what I would have done if I had to give a eulogy for her. I\u2019m sure some people would be upset and angry to hear me say how much I disliked my mom, but those are the same people that only saw the charming facade she put on for them. \n\nI think OP did the best they could with the eulogy, and if their mom and siblings felt the eulogy was reasonable, then it probably was reasonable. Those who disagreed likely weren\u2019t as exposed to the negative aspects of that person or maybe were in denial about them, but OP had every right to speak to their own experience.", "This! At my father\u2019s memorial service, many of his colleagues spoke,  and I felt like I had no idea who the person was they were speaking about.

NTA!", "I agree with this, and also grief may be making them more sensitive in the immediate aftermath then they will be when the dust settles. Most people need distance from the death to be objective. I have a feeling in the future they will see your speech as a true memorial to a complete and complex human being. NTA and I think I would just give it time.", "I agree with all of this. Additionally, the eulogist's motivation counts, too. If you're getting up there to unleash a lot of resentment as a sort of catharsis, then you should probably not accept the charge of giving the eulogy and save your comments for your therapist. First and foremost, funerals are for the living, and that's what should always be remembered.", "Who cares if they want to say something nice, let them.  Everyone grieves in their own way.  You could have just cancelled the service if you wanted to police everyone's comments.", "Thank you for that gem.", "Isnt the aftermath of his death the literal most useless time to address issues, though? He can't rehabilitate; hes dead. The time to speak up was 20 years ago, to his face. Shittalking a dead person is shitty on the basic premise they're not around to defend themselves or use it to self-reflect, only totally and permanently.\n\nSeriously, how is there any good in talking smack of someone *dead*? They're dead; what's done is done. They're not changing their ways; they're not apologizing.  That's like the ultimate time to exercise radical acceptance and focus on the silver lining.", "Doesnt sound like he did when he was alive.", "Everyone that knew my mom (neighbors, former co-workers, church family, hospital nursery where she volunteered) thought they knew her. And they did. But not as well as her children.  And the family pressured each child to speak.  No one else was requested to speak. And the family knew what would be said.  Let this be a warning to neglectful, mean, judgmental, abusive parents.  There will be a day when the people who fell for your act will learn the truth. Be nice to your kids. It is not that hard. NTA.", "People in the audience who drink too much could definitely benefit from hearing how drinking mangled the deceased's relationship with those closest to him.

We are not supposed to acknowledge or talk about the crappy parts of life, becasue it helps abusive behavior to hide in those shadows, and abuse victims are undermined. I am not talking about one specific nicety or abuse- I think they are all intertwined.\n\nNot to say that \"radical honesty\" is appropriate- we can be kind and acknowledge the negatives in life- as the OP did. The aunts are pissed because they have spent decades in denial and covering up what is, in all likelihood intergenerational addiction and abusive behavior associated with it.  By being truthful (even in a kind way), the Op was destroying all their hard built coping mechanism around their denial.  But it was a truth that needed to be said. To stop the cycle. If nothing else.", "No kidding. If anyone's gotten a \"Perfect Person Award,\" I'd love to see it. I know I don't have one.", "Doesn\u2019t even sound like OP bitched about their dad.

Going to therapy and \"digging up the past of a dead woman\" (some things she did to me would get me banned from the site for mentioning). The only people not pissed about it are her sisters who she cut contact with for trying to rescue me via CPS and failed, and my godparents who didn't fight hard at all and didn't realize how bad it actually was.", "They didn't have to act like she wasnt an abuser. The problem is they contrived the situation so that all shes painted as was as their abuser, even though there were people who had a different, positive experience with her.  \n\nThe woman was more than their shitty mother cause she was more than a mother, period. She was a family member otherwise, a church-goer, a neighbor, a customer, a friend etc.\n\nThey didn't go for balanced or authentic, they censored it to not allow any positivity. That's what strikes me as messed up.", "Exactly anyone who ever disagrees is a bot or crazy."]}
