I think your neighbor doesn't realize that you like having them because it's a collection that you've built. Maybe you could suggest she uses that $100 to get him a binder and a bunch of card packs, so he can have the fun of building a collection of his own.", "NTA. Not only they are your cards and you have the right not to sell them.\n\nThey also have a personal value to you, it's perfectly reasonable to not want to sell them.", "Nta. Your mom sounds annoying. She has no business telling you what to do with personal stuff.", "NTA. If you don't want to sell, you don't have to sell. They are your cards and you can do whatever you want with them. The nerve of your neighbour to ask more than once, though.\n\nAlso, just for the record, I know many adults who still have their Pok\u00e9mon cards. All good.", "NTA.  Offer to go get a binder and some cards for the neighbor kid with that $100.  Hide your cards.  My first suspicion was that your mom put the neighbor up to it.  No way a neighbor should randomly be so pushy about that.  That's too weird.", "NTA\n\nShe can go to the store and buy $100 in pokemon right now and leave you alone.\n\n\".

Make sure to hide your collection from your mom.", "NTA and keep your cards kept away somewhere only you know.", "NTA, but I\u2019d recommend keeping your cards somewhere where your mom can\u2019t find them, cause she could decide to sell them without you knowing.", "NTA NTA NTA. As a fellow adult (32M) Pokemon fan (and geek in general) I find your neighbor and your mother very disrespectful.  \nI don't collect the cards. I have some from when I was a kid, but I never cared much for the TCG. However, I can understand why some people do.   \nI don't know how big your collection is, but even a small collection will run you more than $100. Not to mention the presumably sentimental value. If your neighbor wants to buy her grandson $100 worth of Pokemon cards, she can go to a store and buy some. If where you live is anything like where I live, she wouldn't even need to drive 10 minutes to find a store that sells them. And since they kid doesn't have any yet, she can't buy the wrong kind.", "Nta, tell her to use those 100$ to buy new cads for their kid", "Grandma doesn\u2019t understand the value of collecting, which is the anticipation and appreciation of each acquisition. The kid isn\u2019t going to stay engaged of a whole collection is just handed to him.", "NTA go buy $50 of starter decks and profit", "NTA. You're under no obligation to sell something of yours just because somebody else wants it.\n\nIf you're willing to talk to her still/want to keep up the relationship, maybe offer to help her find some starter decks and packs so he can start his own collection?", "NTA, and (this is just me providing my example and not in any way encouraging or discouraging the desire to have children) as a someone in their 30s about to have a child, I am so glad that I kept my pokemon cards.  Pokemon was and still is a big part of my life, and I am so glad that I never sold them or threw them out, I can't wait to show my kids someday.  My point is that those are yours, and you don't ever have to give away something that you care about because someone \"thinks that you're done with them\".", "NTA.  Seriously, what is it with people that they see something you have that they want, and they expect you to give it to them.  THE KID IS SIX.  If she feels Pokemon is that important, why can't she just go out and buy cards for him herself.  She's looking for the easy way out, and if it means guilting you, she apparently has no problem playing that card \\[lol\\].", "NTA and you should secure them so your Mom doesn\u2019t decide to sell them for you", "NTA.  You are under no obligation to sell just because somebody wants to buy (as I tell the real estate people every time they call asking to buy our house.)", "Aback.  Taken aback.  NTA anyways :)", "NTA. Just because someone wants something of yours doesn\u2019t mean you have to sell it to them.", "NTA - Why doesn't he take that $100 and go buy the grandson some brand new pokemon cards of his own? Then he and you could play together and trade cards.   It's absurd for anyone to think that the kid is entitled to your possessions.", "NTA. It\u2019s okay to enjoy Pok\u00e9mon cards as an adult. It\u2019s okay that your collection is meaningful to you. \n\nShe didn\u2019t need to ask you multiple times. She should have stopped after you said no the first time. \n\nAlso, I agree with what some others have said - hide your cards! It sounds like the people around you don\u2019t respect your collection. I can see this turning into a scenario where your mom sells your cards because *she* didn\u2019t think it would be a big deal.", "NTA I would just do a quick price for each card on tcgplayer or somet and show her how much the true value is. Even if they aren\u2019t rare old cards still have value.", "NTA. Pokemon cards increase in value if they are kept well. Also they\u2019re yours and you still enjoy them. Besides a large part of the fun of the hobby is the mystery of the box. Which cards will you get???", "No OP, you are NTA.\n\n1. It\u2019s your choice to sell them or not. So what if you\u2019re an adult? \n2. Her asking MULTIPLE TIMES after you told her no is out of line. She\u2019s just trying to pressure you into selling them. And why can\u2019t she just buy new Pok\u00e9mon cards from an official vendor?\n\nYou can like anything, regardless of your age and the target demographic of the thing. That lady has zero understanding of emotional value and she\u2019s trying to make you feel bad about it for her own personal gain. \n\nEnjoy your Pokemon cards, and don\u2019t feel self conscious about being \u201ctoo old\u201d for them. That\u2019s complete bs.", "NTA\n\nThey\u2019re your cards. Your neighbour can buy her grandson his own set of cards. To be honest, I find your neighbour quite disrespectful for pushing the issue and not taking no for an answer.", "NTA\n\nThose are collectibles and you'll want them in ten or twenty years. Even just to look at and feel nostalgia lol. Some may even gain value, you never know how the market will go.", "NTA - your cards, your choice to sell them or not.\n\nEdit - hide the cards from your mom because she might decide to sell them for you!!!!", ">She says I don\u2019t need them because I am an adult and he is a kid.\n\nNTA.

I still have teddy bears from my childhood. \nNo one NEEDS collections,  they just have them to enjoy\n\nNTA", "NTA. As some others have recommended, I would get them valued and hide them. You say you might not have rare cards, but if you have been collecting a while I'd hazard you have more than $100 worth - and that's not touching on sentimental value.", "NTA.

Especially if you kept them in good condition.\n\nI would make a spreadsheet of all your cards, their condition and average-low cost of each card. If she starts pushing give her the true average cost. If she says no and that you are greedy give her the low cost along with a copy of the spreadsheet.

NTA", "Not that I disagree with what you're saying, but the pokemon tcg market is pretty ridiculously predictable at this point.\nDue to the boom in value old cards had, people started hoarding cards, keeping them in sleeves, acrylic cases, etc.\n\nAt this point, average cards have little to no value regardless of their printed rarity, and cards with gengar, charizard, or popular trainers on them are pretty pricy.\nThe exceptions to this are current meta cards that will likely fall in value once rotated out of standard play.\n\nAnyway, thank you for coming to my TED Talk", "Yup.  I had a box full of rated, rare comics.  Kind of a small part of my retirement plan.  Last I checked they were worth twice what I earned in a year.  They were in storage at mothers place while I was finding my feet.  It took me a while.  About 10 years before I had my own place.  I went to show fetch them and she told me she moved them into the old garage.  When I finally found a box of comics, rats had made a nest inside the box.  When I checked they had all been removed from their covers with drawings in them and pages damaged/missing.  She had given them to my baby cousin, his parents returned them when they were all fucked and in their way.\n\nThat turned into a longer rant than I intended.  I guess I still harbour some resentment towards all that.", "meh. Anything not rare sells for about 1 cent. Market value of 90% of rare cards is under 1 dollar. OP likely has more rares than she thinks so her collection is probably over $100.\n\nBut surely after collecting so long OP has duplicates of common cards or knows where to off-load them at, which would be a perfect place for neighbor to go buy up a ton of cards a 6 year old would love for way less than $100.", "Damn I didn\u2019t even consider that\u2026 shady af."]}
