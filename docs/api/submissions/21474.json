Your brother committed himself, and ONLY himself to child care, and now he's unwilling to fulfill HIS obligation.

You were nice to cover the funeral knowing you don't have a good relationship with your father, and you didn't even get to receive the personal stuff.\n\nIn no way shape or form do you still have to interact with those people, even your brother is an AH to you. You've done too much good, and you've received nothing.", "Oh good grief. Just say no. And you might remind him that you paid the funeral expenses. \nWhat has he done?  This is not your family. He just doesn\u2019t want to be inconvenienced.", "NTA.  I'm not clear on why your brother thinks you are responsible for caring for this child.  To be clear, I also think that if you were to take her for a long weekend, it would end up being for the entire two weeks.  I think your brother is desperate and is saying anything he can to get you to do this.  But this is not your family.  You don't know this child, her mother clearly wants no relationship with you and she doesn't want her daughter to have one either.    You don't owe anyone anything in this situation.

Please.", "NTA - not your circus, not your monkeys.\n\n Bro sounds exhausting. Let him sort his own problems out and stop being guilt tripped by these people.", "NTA - the amount of manipulation used by this family is stunning. You need to walk away.", "NTA but run and block the whole lot otherwise you will be forever stuck in this poisonous mire.", "This isn't an aita - you need to cut these awful people out of your life", "NTA, you have been more than generous.

You paid for burial arrangements but not out of the goodness of your heart, because if it was you wouldn't care if you ever got a thank you, not to mention anything else.

I took it for exactly what it said, that you'd tried to get help from him and he wouldn't help you like he help your brother, which is exactly what I would've expected him to do. Family issue like the ones you described here are way more common than they should be, and they're always sad. I'm sure I'm many, many years older than you so of course my opinions are based on my own experiences. I tend to be a very realistic person with sprinkles of optimism (that's what my 21 year old daughter calls me) because unless they give me the heebie jeebies I do believe in giving everyone the benefit of the doubt. Also I disagree with a lot of people who think people can't change; I've seen really bad people change and stay changed. My issue with people like your father is that when they continually act the same way, or worse, over the years then they don't want to change and it's up to us to figure it out and stop being surprised when they do exactly what we expect them to do. I'm not sure if you did, but when we stop expecting anything from people like him we remove a lot of malice from our hearts. I'm actually unhappy with your brother still being okay with him during his rotten treatment of you but that's another subject. When it comes to family, I've always expected nothing except for them to be who they are. If I put myself out there and get nothing in return, even if they keep mistreating me if totally fine because I've trained my emotions accordingly over the years. They don't even have the power to hurt my feelings ( not all my family are like this, just a few of them LOL). It fills my heart to br able to help when I can and that's why I do it and no other reason. Because you gave me the impression that after you cut him off you actually asked dear old dad for help I told you that was a mistake and gave him the upper hand, and I meant that but looks like you didn't do that. Now, my last sentence or two about you having a decision to make stands, and that decision is solely up to you...good luck!"]}
