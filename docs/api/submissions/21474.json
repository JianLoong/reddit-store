He was abusive and left the family when I was 10 - Until he passed, I\u2019ve seen him maybe 5 times in total. Each time was very difficult and eventually, I broke contact.\n\nMy brother, however, ADORED that man. He was very keen on keeping contact. He moved to the same city and visited him all the time and when our father started a new family and had another daughter, my brother was there every single weekend - the last 14 years. He was part of the family.. they also supported him financially - whilst I often juggled three jobs at once in order to survive. I wouldn\u2019t get a call. - not even for my birthday. And when I ever asked for aid, they basically shut the door in front of my face. \n\nWhen our father passed away, I lived abroad. I was only informed by my brother. When no one could come up spontaneously with the money for the funeral, I covered it. No one ever said, thank you. All belongings of my father, went to his new wife and daughter. They agreed that we could have some personal stuff, but only if it was not of value. My brother offered to put a few pieces aside for me, since I couldn\u2019t come due to Covid restrictions. I haven\u2019t received those things until today. And as soon as the funeral was over the wife blocked me on every medium. Even on her daughters phone. My brother said she was afraid that I was after her money. \n\nNow, 2 two years later - the mum has some medical issues, so the daughter is supposed to stay at my brother place for 8 weeks. But he\u2019s overwhelmed with it and so he wanted to send her to ME. I told him that she could come for a long weekend, to see how it goes. But that I felt uncomfortable with it, because after all, I don\u2019t know this child. But he insisted she should come for 2 weeks because him and his girlfriend would be in desperate need of holidays. When I told him no, he got angry.  He said \u201coh - so you would claim our father\u2019s inheritance (the pieces I never received) but then dip when responsibilities come your way?\u201d\nHe said I\u2019m still part of the family, and that means that I should also take care of them. That I should be grateful for having him as a brother. Because he\u2019s taking care of a child, basically also for ME. He said he never expect me to be someone to turn down a child in need and if the stressful phase would affect his relationship negatively, he would blame me for it. Ever since he ignores me.\n\nAITA for not wanting to be involved here ?\n\nEdit: having this thread out for bit, reading all the messages - first made me cry (because I\u2019ve never received so much reassurance) and then it made me pissed because reading the story over and over again showed me why I got away from that family and why I should keep it that way. I am in therapy and I am healing, this is why I set boundaries for the first time now - and maybe it\u2019s normal that they go crazy about it. Because they benefited from me being a push over in the past. And these pushover tendencies are still there - otherwise I wouldn\u2019t be here, asking for reassurance. But I\u2019m getting there.. slowly. This is my first post on Reddit - I didn\u2019t expect it to turn out to be such a supportive and helpful experience.

I took it for exactly what it said, that you'd tried to get help from him and he wouldn't help you like he help your brother, which is exactly what I would've expected him to do. Family issue like the ones you described here are way more common than they should be, and they're always sad. I'm sure I'm many, many years older than you so of course my opinions are based on my own experiences. I tend to be a very realistic person with sprinkles of optimism (that's what my 21 year old daughter calls me) because unless they give me the heebie jeebies I do believe in giving everyone the benefit of the doubt. Also I disagree with a lot of people who think people can't change; I've seen really bad people change and stay changed. My issue with people like your father is that when they continually act the same way, or worse, over the years then they don't want to change and it's up to us to figure it out and stop being surprised when they do exactly what we expect them to do. I'm not sure if you did, but when we stop expecting anything from people like him we remove a lot of malice from our hearts. I'm actually unhappy with your brother still being okay with him during his rotten treatment of you but that's another subject. When it comes to family, I've always expected nothing except for them to be who they are. If I put myself out there and get nothing in return, even if they keep mistreating me if totally fine because I've trained my emotions accordingly over the years. They don't even have the power to hurt my feelings ( not all my family are like this, just a few of them LOL). It fills my heart to br able to help when I can and that's why I do it and no other reason. Because you gave me the impression that after you cut him off you actually asked dear old dad for help I told you that was a mistake and gave him the upper hand, and I meant that but looks like you didn't do that. Now, my last sentence or two about you having a decision to make stands, and that decision is solely up to you...good luck!", "Okay - having this thread out for bit, reading all the messages - first made me cry (because I\u2019ve never received so much reassurance) and then it made me pissed because reading the story over and over again showed me why I got away from that family and why I should keep it that way. I am in therapy and I am healing, this is why I set boundaries for the first time now - and maybe it\u2019s normal that they go crazy about it. Because they benefited from me being a push over in the past. \nAnd these pushover tendencies are still there - otherwise I wouldn\u2019t be here, asking for reassurance. But I\u2019m getting there.. slowly.\n\nThis is my first post on Reddit - I didn\u2019t expect it to turn out to be such a supportive and helpful experience. Thank you so much everyone.", "Let's recap:\nThere were valuable pieces in the house but nobody thought about selling to pay the funeral.\nThen the wife blocked you instead of thanking. It is just a chance that blocking you she also prevented you from getting aware of her real financial state (example: if she went on vacation after the funeral).\nYour brother knows all of it and elaborated on her behalf instead of confronting her.\nYour brother also did not chip in for the funeral even though he knows your relationship with your dad.\n\nNTA and block all these scammers.\n\nEDIT: read in the comments your dad left a fortune and neither the wife nor your brother thought about repaying you for the funeral? And calling photos \"inheritance\"??? OP, I know the feeling, it's enough joy when you're able to set boundaries. But in the real world they are probably scamming you and it may be useful to talk with a lawyer", "What the actual fuck?! For 14 years, you were treated like trash and turn their heads away while you asked for their help financially or otherwise. When your father died, you paid for the funeral. Your reward: nit a simple 'thank you' for it and his widow blocking you on every social media because she was scared of you because of his money? Then your brother gets piss off at you for not taking care of a you don't even know. Fuck that.\nTell him to not only keep the kid that only know it related to you by blood, but to keep the 'inheritance', keep the money that the wife was scared you'd take, and to keep his ass out of everything that involves you because you're not part of his family.\n\nYou are not the asshole. Your father, his wife and your brother and his gaslighting are the assholes. I would cut him out of your life, but it's ultimately your decision. Don't let your brother push you around and be safe.", "NTA. I would remind your brother that the child's mother has blocked all methods of you contacting her or her daughter. She (mom) would not want you to have access to this child. You can't take her even if the mom suddenly reopens communication, because you realize it is only re-established for their gain.", "NTA. After her money? The money she could not use to bury HER HUSBAND??\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEveryone in this family is horrible and crazy except for you. They all seem to like to play happy families until it is time to take responsibility for something (like a funeral or a child). I pity the girl, but do not even take her in for a weekend. Cut all these people off. They just want to treat you as less and use you. There are 'families' like that. Yours is one of them sadly.\n\nYour brother is a giant hypocrite. He is criticizing you for not stepping up and his ass cannot make it past 8 weeks with the kid without a 2 week vacation.", "Nta.. DO NOT TAKE THAT CHILD. 1. She does not know you and it would be very awkward/traumatic for everyone involved, especailly for 2 weeks. 2. You don't owe them anything, you already paid for the funeral of the man who basically abandoned you. 3. Cut contact with the whole lot of them. Throw the whole trash family out. Do not let them make you feel bad. You are just treating them the way you have been treated by them. You have already done enough. Sorry for the kid, but not YOUR kid, not YOUR problem. You helped out before and they sh!t on you. You take care of you!", "NTA. You earned your part of the \"inheritance\" when you paid for the funeral of a man that shut the door in your face numerous times. His wife blocked you because she didn't want to give you any of his money. What money? They couldn't even pay for a funeral. Tell your brother that you have done more than enough for them, and they need to figure it out. They only consider you as family when they need something. Continue working on yourself. You deserve peace and happiness.", "Forgetting everything else you have written, does that child have a relationship with you? If the answers is no, then you should not be caring for her at all. \n\nNTA", "NTA. In both the US and the UK Funeral costs come out of the estate and can be claimed back from it before any inheritance is paid out. So if he had anything to give to his wife, then she has stolen the cost from you. If it was a lot and you need the money, you may want to consider using legal means to recover it. And you owe no favours to someone who treated you like shit and then stole from you. People don't have the right to treat you badly because you share some chromosomes.", "Dude I wouldn\u2019t even take the child for a weekend. Especially not after that clown blew up on you like that.\n\nI\u2019d tell him \u201cSorry bro. I don\u2019t like you enough to be doing you any favors. Figure it out, yourself, bucko.\u201d\n\nAbsolutely NTA. Sounds to me like you oughta start blocking people, since they seem so eager to use you then throw you away when it suits them.", "NTA but dude, that\u2019s your half sister and a 10 year old. Consider not making her suffer for your fathers sins. She didn\u2019t do any of that. I\u2019d say be open to getting to know her in case she turns out ok, but this is some good advice here.

I wouldn\u2019t even have paid for the funeral.", "Nta. They only want you around when it benefits them and you deserve better.", "NTA. Your brother clearly takes after your AH of a dad. None of this is the fault of the kid but as you\u2019re literally blocked on all methods of communication by her mother, I would say you absolutely should not touch her with a bargepole. Dad, brother and new wife made this situation, those of them who are still alive can deal with it on their own. Block them all right back and get on with your own life.", "NTA AT ALL! They don't get to pick and choose when you're \"family\" and when you're not. You shouldn't have paid for the funeral, but at least it gave you a clear picture of who these people are. Taking your money, then blocking you because they were afraid you'd go after their money - seriously?! \n\nPlease, please do yourself a favor and block the whole lot. Your brother included. He knows how your father treated you, yet he chose him over you. He also chose his stepmother and half sister over you. Let him deal with his choices. You deserve much better, but you'll never get it as long as you keep taking crap from AHs.", "NTA you paying your father's funeral was more than enough. You don't need to be guilt tripped and you don't need to cover anymore costs to them. The wife choose to exclude you for fear of you coming after your money. That means a big fat no to looking after her child unless she pays you for your child or the funeral costs.", "NTA. I read your edit so I see you are beginning to understand the situation. So I'm posting for support because your entire family are AHs.\n\nReturn the favor, block them and live your best life without these leeches in it.", "NTA. I literally laughed out loud when I read the part about \"she was afraid that I was after her money\", what money? Why didn't she used it to pay for the funeral instead of having you do it?", "NTA  Delete these people from your life.  They don't care about you.  They only contact you when they want something. Go NC you also don't need them trying to guilt trip you.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBlock their numbers. And: Don'T take the kid. The kid would likely be yours to raise for the nex 15+ years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGo no contact with ALL of those AHs.", "NTA.  Stop letting them take advantage.  Do not send any more money, ever. Do not take this child in; you will end up with her permanently.  They have plenty of money for a 2-week holiday but none for the funeral?  Cut all contact with your brother; he\u2019s a user.\n\nYou deserve better; give it to yourself.", "NTA.  I would ask him what inheritance since you didn't receive anything.  Ask if it was mistakenly filtered to his bank account.", "NTA\n\nDo not engage with any of them anymore. It's already crazy enough you paid for the funeral and now you are supposed to take care of a kid you have never even seen? \n\nPlease go no contact with all these people as they are just there to take advantage of you.", "NTA\n\nI would tell your brother that they choose to only need you or want you around when it\u2019s convenient for them.

Your Brother certainly is though. You don't owe anything to any of them.", "NTA\n\nThe only people who get upset with boundaries are the ones why they were made in the first place. \n\nDitch the family. You've done enough.

Your brother wants to take advantage and pawn her off to you.", "NTA and I really cannot understand why your brother seems to think you should he grateful to have him in your life (he does not sound great and you do) I really think they are benefiting more than you are.   Plz stop doing things for them plz think about going NC.  Family are not about doing things and getting things out of people it is about love and mutual respect.   \n\nYour father was abusive & toxic, this behavior is learned and it sounds like your brother, his wife has learned the same.  She blocked when you have done nothing that she was accusing you of.   She must have know that your father abandoned you, maybe he did not make child support payments, and she knew who knows the thing is these are in the past and it sounds like you are moving forward. Therefore move forward cut the contact you do not know the wife, you do not know this poor little girl, it sounds like you are just learning about your brother. \n\nI bet he is not going to tell his step mother that her child is coming to you and this also can cause problems. \n\nIf she wants you to be involved in this little girl life she can unblock you and ask how you are?

You owe them exactly nothing, and if the daughter comes, I guarantee it will turn into them taking advantage of you again. Please have nothing more to do with them. You deserve people in your life who treat you with love and kindness. I think no contact should be kept for very rare circumstances and this is one of those times. You paid for your fathers funeral despite his cruelty and they didn\u2019t even give you a few little keepsakes?
