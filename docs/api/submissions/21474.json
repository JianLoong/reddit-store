He was abusive and left the family when I was 10 - Until he passed, I\u2019ve seen him maybe 5 times in total. Each time was very difficult and eventually, I broke contact.\n\nMy brother, however, ADORED that man. He was very keen on keeping contact. He moved to the same city and visited him all the time and when our father started a new family and had another daughter, my brother was there every single weekend - the last 14 years. He was part of the family.. they also supported him financially - whilst I often juggled three jobs at once in order to survive. I wouldn\u2019t get a call. - not even for my birthday. And when I ever asked for aid, they basically shut the door in front of my face. \n\nWhen our father passed away, I lived abroad. I was only informed by my brother. When no one could come up spontaneously with the money for the funeral, I covered it. No one ever said, thank you. All belongings of my father, went to his new wife and daughter. They agreed that we could have some personal stuff, but only if it was not of value. My brother offered to put a few pieces aside for me, since I couldn\u2019t come due to Covid restrictions. I haven\u2019t received those things until today. And as soon as the funeral was over the wife blocked me on every medium. Even on her daughters phone. My brother said she was afraid that I was after her money. \n\nNow, 2 two years later - the mum has some medical issues, so the daughter is supposed to stay at my brother place for 8 weeks. But he\u2019s overwhelmed with it and so he wanted to send her to ME. I told him that she could come for a long weekend, to see how it goes. But that I felt uncomfortable with it, because after all, I don\u2019t know this child. But he insisted she should come for 2 weeks because him and his girlfriend would be in desperate need of holidays. When I told him no, he got angry.  He said \u201coh - so you would claim our father\u2019s inheritance (the pieces I never received) but then dip when responsibilities come your way?\u201d\nHe said I\u2019m still part of the family, and that means that I should also take care of them. That I should be grateful for having him as a brother. Because he\u2019s taking care of a child, basically also for ME. He said he never expect me to be someone to turn down a child in need and if the stressful phase would affect his relationship negatively, he would blame me for it. Ever since he ignores me.\n\nAITA for not wanting to be involved here ?\n\nEdit: having this thread out for bit, reading all the messages - first made me cry (because I\u2019ve never received so much reassurance) and then it made me pissed because reading the story over and over again showed me why I got away from that family and why I should keep it that way. I am in therapy and I am healing, this is why I set boundaries for the first time now - and maybe it\u2019s normal that they go crazy about it. Because they benefited from me being a push over in the past. And these pushover tendencies are still there - otherwise I wouldn\u2019t be here, asking for reassurance. But I\u2019m getting there.. slowly. This is my first post on Reddit - I didn\u2019t expect it to turn out to be such a supportive and helpful experience.

To be clear, I also think that if you were to take her for a long weekend, it would end up being for the entire two weeks.  I think your brother is desperate and is saying anything he can to get you to do this.  But this is not your family.

I took it for exactly what it said, that you'd tried to get help from him and he wouldn't help you like he help your brother, which is exactly what I would've expected him to do. Family issue like the ones you described here are way more common than they should be, and they're always sad. I'm sure I'm many, many years older than you so of course my opinions are based on my own experiences. I tend to be a very realistic person with sprinkles of optimism (that's what my 21 year old daughter calls me) because unless they give me the heebie jeebies I do believe in giving everyone the benefit of the doubt. Also I disagree with a lot of people who think people can't change; I've seen really bad people change and stay changed. My issue with people like your father is that when they continually act the same way, or worse, over the years then they don't want to change and it's up to us to figure it out and stop being surprised when they do exactly what we expect them to do. I'm not sure if you did, but when we stop expecting anything from people like him we remove a lot of malice from our hearts. I'm actually unhappy with your brother still being okay with him during his rotten treatment of you but that's another subject. When it comes to family, I've always expected nothing except for them to be who they are. If I put myself out there and get nothing in return, even if they keep mistreating me if totally fine because I've trained my emotions accordingly over the years. They don't even have the power to hurt my feelings ( not all my family are like this, just a few of them LOL). It fills my heart to br able to help when I can and that's why I do it and no other reason. Because you gave me the impression that after you cut him off you actually asked dear old dad for help I told you that was a mistake and gave him the upper hand, and I meant that but looks like you didn't do that.
