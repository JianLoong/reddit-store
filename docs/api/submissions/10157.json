F1 said that since Pride Month was coming up (and since 3/4th of this friend group was LGBT) we should attend the local Pride event. It happens every year and the community gets together for some barbecue and greetings. My religion (not specified here bc I don\u2019t want to receive hate) doesn\u2019t support LGBT, but hey, love the sinner hate the sin. So I sucked it up and said sure because I wanted to support my three friends.\n\nI wanted to surprise them, so I spent about fifty dollars online for some Pride stickers and a Progress Pride blanket they could wrap themselves in when they got cold. They arrived a week later and I hid them in my closet for the right moment. F2 dropped by later that day to strike up some friendly conversation, which somehow steered towards my religion and LGBT. I tried to be as nice as possible, but F2 still ended the chat on a bad note because she thought I was inherently homophobic bc of my religion.\n\nNgl, I felt pretty darn bummed after that. F2 must have blabbed to F1 and F3 about the talk we had because all three of them talked to me less and less. At this point I didn\u2019t want to force myself to participate in the Pride event with them bc I didn\u2019t want to go in the first place, I agreed only to make them happy. I told them that I would be dropping them off and picking them up and that\u2019s it. They thought I was doing this because I was \u201chomophobic and transphobic.\u201d The religion talk I had with F2 a while ago probably worsened the relationship too.\n\nThe day of the Pride event came and I didn\u2019t even want to meet up with F1, 2, and 3. They had been making passive aggressive jokes at me for about a week and a half now. I dropped off all the Pride goodies I bought for them and some money for an Uber at F1\u2019s door.

All you had to say was \"that's not really my scene\" and stick to that.\n\nBut the bigger issue is that you are homophobic. Your religion is homophobic, and you believe what your religion tells you. \"Loving the sinner but hating the sin\" is total BS. If we are going to talk about religion, EVERYBODY sins! What makes your sin ok, and their sin bad? Aren't all sins bad? Why hate people just because they sin differently from you?\n\nNow, I don't believe that homosexuality is a sin.

It would've been a very uncomfortable ride with them. \n\nTheir logic is flawed, and most people will come for you because religious beliefs are a hard topic. People in power that belong to the same religion as you have persecuted the LGBT community for decades now, so I wouldn't blame them for all that. The \"love the sinner hate the sin\" thing is a bit odd, maybe not the way I'd phrase it, but I kinda get what you're trying to say.  \n\nHave a conversation with them three and tell then how you really feel about them.

OP maybe doesn't understand how their religion makes their \"friends\" feel unsafe and yet again without interaction OP might never get it.\n\nOP might be inherently homophobic, but how else do you deal with it unless it's through exposure?

The \u201csin, is sex - often the physical communication of love. When you \u201chate the sin,\u201d you are saying you think your friends need to be alone in life. No romantic partners. No sex. For the rest of their lives. So they can be \u201cpure\u201d for you. \n\nYour religion has taught you bigotry and you are living up to their example.", "If you \u201cdon\u2019t agree\u201d with the way people are born and then living their lives in a way that makes them happy, you cannot truly be their friend. No matter how nice you are to them and how many gifts you buy them, you are \u201cdisagreeing\u201d with something that\u2019s in the core of who they are.", "I can disagree with someone's economic or environmental or parenting choices and still be friends with them. But if you are disagreeing with who they are at their core, then you can't have a real friendship. I wouldn't want to be friends with someone who thinks that there is something inherently wrong with the way I exist.", "Being loved \u201cdespite\u201d something core about yourself doesn\u2019t really feel like love. I don\u2019t even talk to my parents for \u201ctolerating\u201d me, I wouldn\u2019t keep a friend, either.", "You need to spend some time thinking about that phrase. The fact that you could use it means to me, and everyone else around you that you do not respect LGBT people as much as a straight people.\n\nYou don't see it now, because you keep arguing that your disrespect is not real, but we all see it.", "There's no real way to phrase \"I think what you are doing is wrong and sinful, even though it hurts no one; but I still want to be friends,\" and not have your friends feel badly about hearing that.", "That phrase suggests that every thing they are is a \"sin\", and \"sin\" is \"evil\". You can't \"love the sinner, hate the sin\" when the \"sin\" is a fundamental part of who they are and cannot change. It's saying they are evil for just plain existing. That is the material point. Like saying it's a sin to be Black, that would inherently make me a sinner (evil) and there's nothing I could do to change it. Imagine someone you call \"friend\" saying something about you that you can't change is evil, and religion doesn't count.", "You owe them an apology.", "My dude. You don\u2019t need religion to want to leave the world a better place. Not a purpose in life.", "I respect your point, but I really dont change my religion. It is too painful to throw everything away. I think I just need to get some more understanding friends, so instead of only me understanding them they would understand me", "I\u2019m basing my judgment off of everything you have written here. You blatantly admitted in a comment to looking down on your friends because you are homophobic. You may think that they couldn\u2019t tell, but obviously they could and decided they didn\u2019t want to be around someone that tried to buy their friendship while actively judging and hating who they are as people. You need to do some serious thinking about your beliefs, or you will continue to have this issue your entire life.", "All good", "I did not think anything was wrong with them! If I did I would not have tried so hard to be friends. You must be describing Christianity! I am not christian! my religion is different", "So in your mind, someone has to love EVERY SINGLE THING about you or you toss them aside? Can't have a single criticism about you? you must love your sycophants, I mean friends.", "After reading what others said, I do not think so. Looking back, they had never been kind to me to begin with. I was only doing my best to please them and they used me for an emotional trashcan. I had to comfort them when they were down and buy them gifts all the time. But they never comforted me or bought me anything.", "Oh, so you don\u2019t want to change your religion because it\u2019s part of your identity, but you have no problem being part of a religion that tells people how they should live their life and that they will go to hell if they don\u2019t subscribe to their beliefs. Funny", "This is the first thing you've said I agree with. Find some friends that share your archaic views, not people who will be actively hurt and offended when you tell them your religion is more important to you than their literal feelings or lives", "Gay people are not obligated to accept or understand your homophobic religion. If you are set in being part of a homophobic religion, then you can say goodbye to ever having gay friends.", "Why did you ask this subreddit at all if you were just going to believe that you are in the right regardless? Everyone here is telling you that you\u2019re an AH but you obviously aren\u2019t taking any of it in. You don\u2019t even think you need to apologize, which proves you\u2019re not actually listening to anyone here. If this is how you act all the time, then your friends may be better off without you. Good luck in life, you\u2019re going to need it.", "Please write word for word where I said that! English is not my first language so true meaning must been lost through translation. I never look down on any of my friends!"]}
