I felt I was justified at the time, but since my family hates conflict, I am wondering if I may be TA.\n\nBG: I (24f) moved out of home for school at 18 and have been living abroad on my own ever since, cooking my own food. I don't believe I am a picky eater, but I do avoid certain foods (most meat, mayo, vinegar). If I am invited somewhere and I don't like the food or some of the ingredients I will smile and eat anyways, but I avoid those foods if I can choose. My mother knows about it, so when she cooks, she usually will set aside a small portion for me before adding mayo or vinegar.\n\nOne of the side dishes of yesterday's meal was a potato salad typical of my region. Basically potato puree with small pieces of veggies and seafood mixed in mayo. Mayo is a key element of the recipe, which is why I never order that dish, but my mother usually sets aside a portion before adding the mayo. Usually, she will set aside a big portion so that other people feel welcome to eat the alternative, no mayo version if they want (dinners here are always potluck style), but this time she forgot and I arrived at the kitchen on time to set aside a small part that had no mayo yet, not more than three or four spoons. So when we served dinner, I just took the plate for myself. We have eaten with everyone invited yesterday countless times and I can't remember any time any of them ate the no-mayo version. I ate the same main as everyone else.\n\nOne of the family friends noticed my plate was different. She asked me if I didn't think the potato salad was great? I agreed. Then why did my plate look different, and why hadn't I been served from the same dish as the others? I told her mine had no mayo. Did I have any intolerance? No ma'am, I just don't like mayo. But potato salad without mayo is just potato puree! Maybe, ma'am, I enjoy potato puree.\n\nAt this time she started insisting I try the real recipe and see how good it is. I told her I grew up with it, I knew it was good and I was happy everyone enjoyed it, I just preferred my version. I admit I was a bit short, I didn't see my meal choice warranted so much attention. My family hates conflict and was trying to steer the conversation somewhere else, but this person went on a rant about how young people are entitled and unappreciative of their traditions. I looked her dead in the eye and said I did not think I was the entitled one here since I had not gone to her own home to tell her how to eat her own food.\n\nComplete silence.\n\nShe was visibly annoyed but let my mother change the topic. I believe I was on my right to tell her she was out of line, but my poor grandpa looked dismayed at the tension, and it probably would have been easier if I had taken a small portion with mayo and politely agreed.

The potato salad is prepared beforehand and left in the fridge to serve cold, so my no-mayo portion was in a small dish in the fridge too. When we took all the dishes to the main table, I placed the big potato salad in the middle and then the small one next to my plate, and then we called everyone to the table. The other guests either assumed I had served myself already or realized and did not care. I was surprised anyone commented at all.\n\nI admit I am trying to change my approach to discussions and just stop engaging with people in conflict while setting firm boundaries. I recognize I could have ignored it earlier and will try to keep that in mind for future conflicts.", "Around my mother's age, so in her 50s. It's not uncommon for people of that age to make that kind of comment in my culture, although my mother will not and I was raised to not get in anyone's business. I don't appreciate it and find it nosy, but I know it's cultural, and made me think I should have let it slide to keep the peace.", "That\u2019s not even relevant tbh", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

In our family, there was frequent discussion about people's food preferences and differences thereof.\n\nBut no one was ever put down for any of it. Dad just was majorly into food and loved to talk about it.\n\nNTA", "Knowing that she\u2019s made similar comments about your food and preferences in the past makes her the AH 100 times more. She was looking for an argument.", "NTA, double NTA seeing this added info.\n\nShe has had an issue with how you eat for a while now, so this isn't a one time conflict. All your choices, as described, seem like healthy ones and she probably takes great offense to that.\n\nYou did nothing wrong. She asked, you answered, then she went off. So you spoke the truth and put her back in her place.", "I'm sorry you met my mom, OP. NTA. And you gave a GREAT response.", "I suspect that some meat eaters who get mad at people who don't eat meat feel guilty about eating meat and don't even realize it. They see your choices as being a rebuke to them.", "It took me almost 50 years to figure that out. You\u2019re way ahead of the game lol. But I try not to engage discussions about things that I am in complete control over or that are in the past. Neither of those is ever productive. People are free to express their opinions and you\u2019re free to not respond to them\u263a\ufe0f", "Probably because *most* enjoy it? Idk, mayo is particularly weird because of how visually and texturally unappealing it is. And unhealthy lol.\n\nPeople seem to have this weird notion that everyone needs to like all of the same things they do. Just because they enjoy it everyone else needs to as well or else we're \"missing out.\" You wouldn't believe the utter meltdowns I've seen people have when they find out I won't eat BBQ sauce.", "I love mayo but get that it's weird and unhealthy. Totally understand why others hate it.", "What's hilarious is like I'm the kind of person that will dip my fries in mayo, but I absolutely hate potato salad, pasta salad, and mayo on bread. At no point has this ever actually been a point of contention with people in my life. People get weirded out by my fries and mayo, and I don't know how people live with mustard on their hot dogs. To start an argument over something so inconsequential? So weird haha", "Aoli is just fancy mayo to me. Mayo with pizzazz.", "Petty yes, but hopefully it\u2019d point out how ridiculous it is to chastise someone about their food preferences \ud83e\udd23", "Sometimes you just can\u2019t win. Sounds like it was that kind of situation. Some people are just rude. You will not change a rude person\u2019s behavior or perspective by being more rude. Just confirms you\u2019re an ah for them. \n\nYou\u2019re definitely NTA but it\u2019s never fun to when other family gets upset. It would bother me if I was involved in a conversation that unintentionally disrupted dinner. I always go with not participating in other people\u2019s nonsense. Let them talk until their blue in the face, keep stuffing food in your mouth, then get up & walk away.\n\nBTW \u2014 I don\u2019t think your response was rude but since you were are at a dinner hosted by your mother in her home it would be a better idea to follow her lead with this particular annoying guest. The more you engage with a rude person, the longer they keep speaking.", "It is for me. \n\nIf this is grandpa\u2019s elderly friend then perhaps the response was part of the problem. While it appears this guest was clearly out of line... Sometimes keeping your mouth closed is the best solution.", "As if you were not eating barbecue sauce at them.", "I know right? My theory is if you want to eat something that I don't want to eat. Congratulations! There's more for you. If I want to eat something that you don't want to eat, congratulations! I'll get that out of your way. I guess I can sort of understand if you had spent a lot of time preparing something and it wasn't appreciated but condiments typically come out of a bottle in your fridge.", "That applies to the guest, too. Mind your business about what/how others eat. I don't see how you can tell OP sometimes it's best to stay quiet when the one who should've shut up was the guest. It doesn't matter how old she is or what Era she's from, respect is standard and the bare minimum.", "If someone was berating me for deciding to eat food how I liked it in my own house, I don\u2019t care if they were 2 or 200 years old, I\u2019d shut them down because they\u2019re out of line. \u201cKeeping your mouth closed\u201d clearly didn\u2019t stop this woman because she went on a whole rant after multiple attempts to change the conversation.", "Ah yes, where politely declining certain foods and condiments is the equivalent of dumping it directly on their heads"]}
