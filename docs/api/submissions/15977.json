I felt I was justified at the time, but since my family hates conflict, I am wondering if I may be TA.\n\nBG: I (24f) moved out of home for school at 18 and have been living abroad on my own ever since, cooking my own food. I don't believe I am a picky eater, but I do avoid certain foods (most meat, mayo, vinegar). If I am invited somewhere and I don't like the food or some of the ingredients I will smile and eat anyways, but I avoid those foods if I can choose. My mother knows about it, so when she cooks, she usually will set aside a small portion for me before adding mayo or vinegar.\n\nOne of the side dishes of yesterday's meal was a potato salad typical of my region. Basically potato puree with small pieces of veggies and seafood mixed in mayo. Mayo is a key element of the recipe, which is why I never order that dish, but my mother usually sets aside a portion before adding the mayo. Usually, she will set aside a big portion so that other people feel welcome to eat the alternative, no mayo version if they want (dinners here are always potluck style), but this time she forgot and I arrived at the kitchen on time to set aside a small part that had no mayo yet, not more than three or four spoons. So when we served dinner, I just took the plate for myself. We have eaten with everyone invited yesterday countless times and I can't remember any time any of them ate the no-mayo version. I ate the same main as everyone else.\n\nOne of the family friends noticed my plate was different. She asked me if I didn't think the potato salad was great? I agreed. Then why did my plate look different, and why hadn't I been served from the same dish as the others? I told her mine had no mayo. Did I have any intolerance? No ma'am, I just don't like mayo. But potato salad without mayo is just potato puree! Maybe, ma'am, I enjoy potato puree.\n\nAt this time she started insisting I try the real recipe and see how good it is. I told her I grew up with it, I knew it was good and I was happy everyone enjoyed it, I just preferred my version. I admit I was a bit short, I didn't see my meal choice warranted so much attention. My family hates conflict and was trying to steer the conversation somewhere else, but this person went on a rant about how young people are entitled and unappreciative of their traditions. I looked her dead in the eye and said I did not think I was the entitled one here since I had not gone to her own home to tell her how to eat her own food.\n\nComplete silence.\n\nShe was visibly annoyed but let my mother change the topic. I believe I was on my right to tell her she was out of line, but my poor grandpa looked dismayed at the tension, and it probably would have been easier if I had taken a small portion with mayo and politely agreed.

Therefore, they start claiming \"well you haven't tried it my way yet\" When that doesn't work they take it as a personal attack. Now, they've forgotten all about the food.

That chocolate stout tastes like a chocolate cake (no, it doesn't), or this blueberry beer is totally sweet and not bitter and hoppy at all (it has barely any sweetness, and is definitely bitter and hoppy).
