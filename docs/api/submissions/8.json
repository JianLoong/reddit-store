This was your grandson and you\u2019re acknowledged his existence. He\u2019s the AH.", "NTA. You naturally assumed that something this important was already communicated to Amelia, and mentioned it in passing. The fact that Jason hid his role as an absentee father from her is a major red flag, and I am sure that Amelia is incredibly thankful.", "NTA. Going against the grain, but telling his wife about your grandchild is your right.

You clearly did not set out with any malicious intent or to break any confidences. You didn't know that the death of your first grandchild and what happened to his mother was meant to be a secret, and it sounds like it never occurred to you (understandably) that your son would have kept such a significant aspect of his life from his wife, his life partner and the mother of his soon-to-be-born child. While we caution against assumptions, this was not an unfair one to make, and you clearly had only well-meaning intentions when you mentioned this to her. She is your family now as well, and you were sharing another part of the family story . . . sharing the memory of one grandchild with the mother of what will be your next grandchild, and doing so with what seems like genuine love in your heart. \n\nAnd I'd say N-A-H, because Jason is entitled to struggle with such a painful part of his past, EXCEPT . . . he berated you not for being the one to tell her, but because he insisted that Amelia DOESN'T NEED TO KNOW because it \"happened 9 years ago\". I'm not sure if he's in denial or is coldly indifferent, but neither is healthy. And while it's true that he deserves some leeway to grieve in his own way, his wife and the mother of his child ABSOLUTELY HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW HOW HE HANDLED THE ACCIDENT THAT CAUSED THE DEATH OF HIS LAST CHILD AND PERMANENT DISABILITY OF HIS MOTHER. After all, in a worst case scenario that could be how he handles an accident happening to her and her child someday . . . she deserves to know and understand that side of him.

Your son is being an ass here, he needs to face up to who he was, what he did and didn't do and the ultimate outcome. Ignoring it doesn't make him a better person, one who has learned to do better and not repeat his mistakes. He should at least honor the memory of his child. As a wife, I wouldn't even be mad if he sent flowers anonymously to Jenna each year on child's birthday, even if she is mentally impaired. It just shows decency towards the person who has gone through unbelievable tragedy, of which he was a part.", "NTA. It's sounds like you had genuinely no idea that DIL wasn't aware. He's overreacted, which I sincerely hope is simply a reaction to something really upsetting. But, like you, I have no idea how your son could not have mentioned this to his wife... loosing a kid is an awful thing to have happened, and you've kept your grandchild's memory alive, when dad won't.", "NTA - people need to give family fair warning when they are living lies. Of course your first grandson will half come up in conversation, and of course you would talk about him.", "I say NTA because you had no idea she didn\u2019t know.

Had they been at the start of their relationship, sure give him a chance to share but after married for 2 years? Wow.", "NTA...\n\n But your son clearly has many unresolved emotions and issues regarding this horrific loss. He is taking it out on you right now but he really needs to talk to someone as these emotions will likely only amplify with a new baby. \n It is good that she now knows so she can be supportive when the baby arrives, but she should not be pressuring him to visit the mother or the grave he obviously is not ready for that.", "NTA. I wonder how it never came up sooner? Telling her the truth only makes you an AH to the person it inconvenienced: your Son. Now he has to face the mistakes of his past, and a version of himself that isn\u2019t very flattering. Those are all issues he needs to work through and move past. He wanted to ignore the past and pretend that never happened and you spoiled that for him. I think now he might have to deal with and hopefully grow from the experiences.", "Nta. And don\u2019t listen to a lot of these posts. Your son was a deadbeat dad, is showing some concerning behaviors to his pregnant wife (straight up lying about his past), and you are a major part that involves all sides of this story. Too many people are saying it\u2019s not your story to tell, when you have just as much right as your kid to do so. You were at least a mother, a grandmother, a de facto mother in law, and a literal mother in law to every single person involved in this drama. You cared for or loved at least a majority of the people mentioned here, yet you have no right to remind the world of your lost relative? Even if you were doing it to prove some point against your son, that wouldn\u2019t make you an asshole. Plenty of young men have kids and don\u2019t all but leave them to the wolves, and then go on to act like they\u2019re outstanding people. If he actually cared about his first child, he should be happy someone is honoring his existence and should definitely not be trying to hide it from the person he\u2019s literally having a kid with.", "NTA.

Your mention that he \u201cwasn\u2019t much of a father\u201d was irrelevant and unnecessary, and it seems you may harbor some related resentment toward him.

You didn\u2019t call to warn him that you\u2019d dropped a fucking bomb into his life.  That\u2019s a pure AH move!  \n\nI\u2019m sure your son has plenty of regrets from that time.  I\u2019m sure he would do things differently.  I get that you disapprove of his actions then, how much time he spent with his son, how he treated the mother of his child, you intimate as much in your letter.  But\u2026 you took it upon yourself to tell your son\u2019s partner about his past - a painful and tragic piece of it - from your POV, not his.  And before he was ready to share it.

If I was in this situation and found out my fianc\u00e9 had a son I would be heartbroken/disappointed and quite angry that I wasn\u2019t told about him. I think it\u2019s disgusting that he had the nerve to be annoyed at you for sharing this information and feels that his new wife didn\u2019t need to know.

I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever lost one of your children, but I know you did lose a grandson and while grief is grief and all is valid. It\u2019s not the same thing. The feelings you feel and sadness maybe similar to his but they are not the same and vice versa the reverse is true. I don\u2019t know if he meant what he said or not but what I do know is that when people are grieving and something happens that reminds them of that pain and grief, they made lash out or leave it in cause a lot of pain to those around them.\n\nI don\u2019t exactly agree with Jason\u2019s calling up and cursing I I know that he may be gone through it but it\u2019s really not an excuse to be mean. Yes, being triggered can be horrible but sometimes when we\u2019re triggered, we can do horribly asshole things.\n\nI really hope you two can have a sit down and actually talk to one another and listen.

Even a young one is painful. In on the same hand it is incredibly painful to lose a grandson. Please try to be as patient as you can with yourself and with your son.\n\nEdit: I think sometimes we say things and things slip out, and there may have been a better way to end the conversation after talking about the first baby since the wife didn\u2019t know.

You did this intentionally and maliciously.", "ESH. Your chosen language *heavily* implies that you already knew she didn't know.", "This may be an unpopular opinion, but I think I have to go YTA without more details given.\n\nI don't necessarily think that your son is a jerk for not telling his wife previously. And while I do understand it is technically still a lie by omission, I do have a sliding scale for those. And that scale involves how the lie by omission impacts the people currently. The sad truths are that Jenna and he are no longer together and have not been for some time, that she is in pallative care, and that your grandson is deceased. None of the outcomes of those things change by basis of him telling his new wife about his previous relationship. Thus, there was nothing to be gained as well by you telling her. It only adds insult to injury and dregs up old emotions that he may have already processed over the 9 years after everything happened.\n\nI also am giving you this judgement because you have chosen to completely vilify your own son while giving zero context as to the situation for why he and Jenna broke up and he had little to no contact with the kid. I don't feel as if it is extremely common for people to break up that early, especially if there is a child involved, and even more so when the parent is encouraging the relationship. Thus...was it a toxic one? Because, while I'm not trying to slander Jenna, there is a definite bias where if someone is disabled, ailing, or extremely young or old people seem to think they are saints. But toxic people can have freak accidents that leave them disabled, just as much as anyone else. If you can come with some more details I'll gladly edit my comment, but until then I have to give your son the benefit of the doubt since you've obviously swayed the writing in your favor.\n\nEdit: And I know some people rationalize that the wife should've known about everything because it might be an example of how he treats her if something happened. However, it's not an apples to apples comparison. By OP's own admission he was already not with Jenna before the accident, so technically she was no longer his full responsibility. Yes, it would've been nice if he'd visit her, assuming they didn't break up for nefarious reasons. But I'm not going to use that same rationale to judge him for not suddenly putting his life on hold to take care of someone he wasn't in a relationship with anymore.", "YTA - the only reason you used the term \"technically\" is that you knew that she did not know. It's not your place to inject yourself into their marriage.", "This is a tough one because you have every right to talk about the death of your grandson. BUT, you can't tell us you didn't know that she didn't know. It would have come up already in conversation if he told her. It's very hard to believe you thought she knew when you've never once talked about it before, including the plants in the yard. The way you phrased it \"this is technically his second child\" seems like you knew she wasn't aware. Let's say you really didn't know, you should have said \"I'm so sorry, please talk to my son,  I feel horrible for letting that slip, I thought you knew.\" YTA.", "YTA. If you had to tell her that technically you thus is his second child at that moment you knew she didn\u2019t know. At that point you end the conversation.

You could have stayed silent when you found her declaration odd, asked your son later in private what he had shared with Amelia and expressed your concerns to him/  As soon as you said \u201ctechnically\u201d you hit detonate..This seems like a form of punishment for your assessment of his parenting.  Having lost a child, let me tell you it\u2019s nobody\u2019s fricking business who I tell or how I deal with that loss.  Tell your therapist, tell your husband, tell your best friend about your loss and your grief as a grandparent.

They can feel that way but again it is not their past, not their loss so they don\u2019t get to be offended that their partner did not willingly share his trauma.  What does it accomplish?  Would they have loved their partner less or not married him because because he had lost a child?  It\u2019s not even about trust.

Definitely dont forget the baby, but at least when she found out that she will be a grandma a second time she could have at the very least gave her son the \"another baby?!\" look and discussed her feelings. The way you are writting it it sounds like OP is hurt as if her first grabd child died yesterday. But the way OP wrote it is letting me know her son may have not necesserally processed it either. Sometimes AH is a strong term but I dont believe ESH either. More like the entire pregnancy was a lot of days where they coupd have discussed this because at the end of the day her decision has gravely impacted her relationship with her son and possibly her new grandson if her son choses to go no contact. Would be extreme but kids do stay away from parents who do not communicate sometimes. I like you point of view though.", "I can see that interpretation, but that's not what I read underlying.", "Yes, that too!", "It's not necessarily about what OP thought of her son back then.

I don't believe for one minute the mother never asked her son if he told his wife about the dead child. IOW mom knew the DIL didn't know.", "It's a form of fraud not to disclose this information to your spouse before you get married.

There are stories in this post from father who were in similar situations, and some of them have said they couldn\u2019t talk about it until after their first child was born because of how painful it was. The wife married the son for who he is now. This tragic part of his past shouldn\u2019t define him as a father, but OP seems bound and determined it does.", "OP is an unreliable narrator.

The county clerk asks you and your spouse several yes or no questions while you are getting your paperwork notorized, which makes the marriage legal.
