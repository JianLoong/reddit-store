{"id": 8, "submission_id": "yinf25", "title": "AITA for ditching the wedding my parents paid for and getting eloped when my sister announced her pregnancy?", "selftext": "The more I think about it, the more I feel bad about it and the more I feel like an arsehole. \nMy whole life my mother has compared me to my older sister. She would always put her on a pedestal and praise her. I could literally never win with my mother, nothing was ever good enough. I was constantly criticized for everything. When I got engaged things changed. My mother was excited and wanted to be involved. My partner and I wanted to elope but my parents said they'll pay for a small wedding as they paid for my sister's. I finally had the attention I craved from my mother. Even if she was judging me for every single thing. My sister would make snarky comments. I knew she wasn't used to not being the centre of attention when it came to our mother.\n\nOn my mehndi night, while I was getting my mehndi done my sister said she had an announcement. She announced that after years of infertility she was pregnant. Everyone was super happy and started congratulating her. It was like my mother forgot about me. The rest of the evening she neglected me and my sister loved all the attention she was receiving. I get that it\u2019s exciting, she is finally pregnant after how long with the first grandchild, but this was calculated, she purposely did this at my event. \n\nOnce everyone had left I contacted my partner to tell him what happened and how upset I was. He understood why I was upset and suggested we go with our original plan, and get Islamically eloped. I knew my sister would pull something else at the wedding and my mother hadn't messaged me once. I was tempted but was worried about my parents spending so much money and things being non-refundable so I called my dad. My dad understood how I felt and said to go for it. Luckily we had a day break in between my mehndi and the Nikah. My dad contacted the Imam and the next day my partner and I went with my dad, my uncle, my partner's brother and uncle to the Mosque. We did our Nikah then went out to eat. It was honestly perfect except my mother started calling me so I blocked her. My partner and I booked a flight to Sydney and left. Once we got there that is when I unblocked my mother and told everyone on Insta. \n\nMy and my husband's phones have been blowing up with calls and messages from everyone calling me immature and a brat for doing what I did and disrespecting my mother. My mother's messages are all about me embarrassing her and everyone gossiping. And all the money she spent and booked on stuff for me. I feel like an arsehole because I wasted that money, even though my dad said it was okay and they can still celebrate just without us. I feel bad for my husband, everyone is talking about how he married an immature brat. I can't fully enjoy this spontaneous trip even though my partner and my dad have told me I should block everyone and enjoy my holiday. Maybe I overreacted? AITA?\n\n\nEDIT: Thank you everyone for the your kind words and congratulations \ud83e\udd0e \nYou guys have helped me put things into perspective. Everyone talking about my dad and cherishing him, don\u2019t worry I do! I have the best Abbu! He understood  how I felt and helped me have the wedding I really wanted. \nI have been enjoying my time with my new husband in Sydney, the weather has been kind to us. Don\u2019t know what the weather is like back home in Auckland but I hope it\u2019s raining \ud83e\udd2d", "created_utc": 1667246978, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yinf25/aita_for_ditching_the_wedding_my_parents_paid_for/", "score": 2476, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Listen to your dad and husband. They\u2019re the beacon you need now. Forget the buzz and drama from other parties and enjoy your time away. \n\nWhen getting back, just give short responses, if any. Try not to explain or defend. It just sucks energy. Those who understand what happened will not nag.

Do you have anything other than your sister's word to confirm she's actually pregnant?", "NTA. The favoritism to your sister is pretty blatant if you dad ENCOURAGES you to blow off the wedding. You did what was right for you and your partner, that is all that matters!", "NTA\n\nYou had the full support of your father so that tells me he knows very well how your mother is and that she favors your sister over you. \n\nWhat you need to do is actually tell your mom how she is. It probably won't change, but it may ease some of how you feel.", "NTA. Listen to your dad, he is right. Your mum is just upset she couldnt parade your pregnant sister around the wedding.", "Your dad gave you the green light and protected you from further problems. He clearly doesn't care about the money.  Your sister is clearly your mother's golden child. \n\nMy only concern is the wedding guests. Were there people who loved you and wanted to celebrate your marriage? If there was no one else, you're clearly N T A. But if you abandoned the wedding and only told friends through Instagram... then you let your mom and sister win. And you hurt the people who love you.", " NTA. Your husband agreed and Dad supported\u2026 based off your comment I can assume you\u2019re maybe Indian/Pakistani or close\u2026having Dads approval is HUGE. That\u2019s all you need. \n\nAnd immature brat? Use the same exact terms to describe your sister and how it was immature of her to announce it then.

I also think your fathers approval is additional proof to you that you're NTA. \n\nAs long as you're happy, and you are happy with how your wedding went, then that's all that matters. I agree with your dad lol just block them for awhile/ go low contact and enjoy your married life", "Oh huns, nta you stated it, your mother had her favorite, your sister could\u2019ve chosen another time to announce her pregnancy yet she did it during your event . Your mom is jus hurt because she was finally given a reality check about her favoritism and missed on a beautiful experience. You had said that they keep on talking down to you and criticizing you why keep allowing that? Enjoy uour honeymoon and the time with your husband that truly loves you and support you, who cares what others have to feel ? Do you and be happy!

I love it when people say that people message them, calling them immature. Like texting someone to tell them that is mature behaviour! \n\nYour mum needs to know that this was a consequence of her and your sisters actions. Tell her that she knows full well your day would've been turned into your sister's day somehow so you finally had an occasion that she couldn't ruin. Your wedding, your rules.", "NTA - you ended up with the wedding that you actually wanted, and you had your father's blessing to do so.  Make a cutesy announcement on social that you and your husband are turning off all electronics to enjoy Australia, and then do it.  Don't look at your phones, don't look at texts or answer calls, focus on each other and enjoy your time there together.", "NTA. If your mother was going to easily turn your back on you on your big day just like that then I think that says a lot. The rest of the day and ceremonies following would have focoused more on your sister than you and I think that is pretty selfish. I don\u2019t know your culture or what is deemed appropriate but I would consider cutting them off. Who knows how they will treat you, your husband, and perhaps your future children.

NTA", "NTA.", ">My dad understood how I felt and said to go for it.\n\nNTA. Dad sounds great.\n\nWhen people elope, sometimes family gets upset. Your mom still loves you. And, she learned a hard lesson about her favoritism. She's probably upset with herself, and projecting, needs someone to blame. Your marriage is about you. Not your mother. She was included, until she disrespected you.\n\nIf you're really worried about the money, start putting some aside, and eventually pay her back.", "NTA, clearly.  Let's just bear one critical thing in mind: you live a traditional Muslim life and both the head of your family (your father) and your Imam approved of your choice.  From what I understand about Islam there would've been no hesitation to tell you no if they disagreed with your choice so you're obviously in the clear here.", "Oh! Your dad \ud83e\udd70\u2764\ufe0f\nCherish him. Cherish our husband. Live  your life and leave this stress in Australia.

Your dad didn't tell his own wife about it, that says it all about what he think of your mum. Listen to your husband and dad. If anyone comment just say that it was done with the blessing of your dad, and was both yours and husband wishes. Your dad will just have to put people straight on the matter of money and tell your mum the reason why she missed the wedding.", "Nta.  I hope you have a happy life.", "NTA!  Your mother is TA!", "NTA, I know it\u2019s hard but don\u2019t let the guilt in. Your mom and sister has shown you who they are and how they will treat/abuse you. Why would you want to have wedding for them, when they are just going to ruin it. You have a right to be happy and free from their petty bullshit. Your dad sounds like a stand up guy, and he said it was ok, just remind yourself of that, and of the happiness you felt when you got married. Chances are that they would have ruined the wedding had you not eloped. \n\nYour mom has some nerve on her talking about embarrassing her. How sad for her, but no thought to the emotional trauma she\u2019s continued to cause you through your whole life. But she was embarrassed! Oh no. Don\u2019t feel sorry  for her. This is the result of her own actions.", "NTA - I think you need to demonstrate some resolve here. You made a decision on what was best for you based on all of the available information you had at the time. So, don\u2019t look back now. It doesn\u2019t matter if your mom is upset. You\u2019ve been upset at her throughout your life. She\u2019ll get over it. Stay strong, enjoy your honeymoon, and don\u2019t let anyone make you feel bad about your decision. You had your reasons for doing what you did. Don\u2019t second guess yourself\u2026especially not because your mom got mad. Even now, she\u2019s not concerned about your feelings (like why you even wanted to skip your wedding in the first place). She\u2019s only concerned with how it looks to other people. If she doesn\u2019t care about how you feel, it\u2019s okay to not care about how she feels. Any time someone calls you in an immature brat, just tell them that you\u2019re sorry they feel that way and keep it moving.", "NTA. Your dad gave you the OK because he knew your mother would react this way and knew he would be hearing it after your elopement. Enjoy yourself.", "NTA enjoy your new husband and beautiful life to come \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA\nAnd congratulations", "NTA\n\nTell anyone who is criticizing you to take it up with your dad and the Imam.", "Nta. Sis is a ah and so is mum", "NTA The fact you talked to your dad first, he okayed it, and was included was huge. Your mom was only paying attention to you because of the wedding. The moment you stopped being a way for her to look good, she turned on you again. I'm sorry you have to deal with that", "NTA - I love they way you handled it. Your dad sounds pretty awesome too. Your mom and sister can have each other. Enjoy your life.", "NTA enjoy your time with your new Husband and block the flying monkeys they throw at you until they find someone else to bother. You handled it all very well and it's very telling how your Father had your back. What you did wasn't bratty in the slightest but, rather mature considering it all. Your wedding is your special day. Now your Mom and sister can stew in the mess they created.", "NTA. Stop trying to get your mother\u2019s approval, which is why you are feeling guilty. She is not worthy.", "NTA\u2014 I wish you a happy marriage! Go NC with your sister and mom but keep your dad :) he is the true MVP.\n\nI would have legit told my mother to just make it a baby shower and blocked her again lol", "NTA- good for you and kudos to your husband and especially your dad. Let everyone else\u2019s opinions go.", "Your mother disrespected you, so, fair is fair. NTA", "NTA... your dad is right. Best results come from you having a great time. \nWhen mom asks, you can tell her you got the wedding you had wanted and your sister got what she wanted. Everyone is happy. I am glad your dad is there for you. Focus on the marriage, the wedding is the easy part!", "NTA!! I\u2019m proud of you for doing what you wanted in the first place. Honestly, just go offline and enjoy your trip. She made the wedding all about her in the first place so why not let it all about her in the end as well\ud83d\ude2c. Put some hard boundaries down please, I can\u2019t imagine what she\u2019s gonna be like when or if you have kids as well. Would she favour one set of grand children over the other too?", "NTA. Your dad and husband are amazing people", "NTA\n\nHonestly your Dad actively facilitated this because he understood what was happening.\n\nYour mother doesn't deserve your love or respect, in fact when all these people annoy you block them after responding with this - My mother has two daughters, she often forgets this.  All my life I have been compared unfavourably with my older sibling and I have had enough.  I was married with my father's blessing and I have nothing to explain to the woman who has never been able to embrace being a mother to me.", "Your now husband backs your up.

Your mother highly favors your sister, and your sister was fully able to hijack a night that was supposed to be about your wedding. If she had cared about your wedding happening, she shouldn't have major sister a priority. Why go through with a wedding entirely just for one person who doesn't like you?

Your sister sounds pretty terrible but clearly your mom taught her that she\u2019s most important so god forbid you get a special day where it\u2019s all about you. I think what she did was definitely intentional and if she were a decent person she\u2019d apologize, I think you should enjoy your honeymoon with your husband. You\u2019re definitely not a brat and I\u2019m sorry the people who love and care about you fail to acknowledge that!", "Nta", "nta. you're dad completely understood and told you to go for it.\n\nhonestly it sounds like if you had stuck with the one that you're mom wanted it wouldn't have been \"your\" wedding.\n\nmy husband and I got married at the courthouse, pulled a couple random witnesses and honestly it was the best thing we ever did.", "Since your dad said go for it, be free of guilt.

If your mum chooses to be this way there isn\u2019t anything you can do about it but at least you have your dad. I would just be honest online and say your sisters announcement was a deliberate and spiteful attempt to have the attention and now she can have it.

You do not have to justify your choice to protect yourself, not to the people that enable the ones that hurt you.  You didn't do wrong here.

She would always put her on a pedestal and praise her. I could literally never win with my mother, nothing was ever good enough. I was constantly criticized for everything. When I got engaged things changed. My mother was excited and wanted to be involved. My partner and I wanted to elope but my parents said they'll pay for a small wedding as they paid for my sister's. I finally had the attention I craved from my mother. Even if she was judging me for every single thing. My sister would make snarky comments. I knew she wasn't used to not being the centre of attention when it came to our mother.\n\nOn my mehndi night, while I was getting my mehndi done my sister said she had an announcement. She announced that after years of infertility she was pregnant. Everyone was super happy and started congratulating her. It was like my mother forgot me. The rest of the evening she neglected me and my sister bathed in the attention she was receiving. I get that it\u2019s exciting, she is finally pregnant after how long with the first grandchild, but this was calculated, she purposely did this at my event. \n\nOnce everyone had left I contacted my partner to tell him what happened and how upset I was. He understood why I was upset and suggested we go with our original plan, and get Islamically eloped. I knew my sister would pull something else at the wedding and my mother hadn't messaged me once. I was tempted but was worried about my parents spending so much money and things being non-refundable so I called my dad. My dad understood how I felt and said to go for it. Luckily we had a day break in between my mehndi and the Nikah. My dad contacted the Imam and the next day my partner and I went with my dad, my uncle, my partner's brother and uncle to the Mosque. We did our Nikah then went out to eat. It was honestly perfect except my mother started calling me so I blocked her. My partner and I booked a flight to Sydney and left. Once we got there that is when I unblocked my mother and told everyone on Insta. \n\nMy and my husband's phones have been blowing up with calls and messages from everyone calling me immature and a brat for doing what I did and disrespecting my mother. My mother's messages are all about me embarrassing her and everyone gossiping. And all the money she spent and booked on stuff for me. I feel like an arsehole because I wasted that money, even though my dad said it was okay and they can still celebrate just without us. I feel bad for my husband, everyone is talking about how he married an immature brat. I can't fully enjoy this spontaneous trip even though my partner and my dad have told me I should block everyone and enjoy my holiday. Maybe I overreacted? AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

(I base this on the fact that that's what every single holiday gathering has been about.)", "100% agree!", "Hopefully she's not the kind of near clinically in-need of support and attention to wait for OP to come back and be celebrating and say she lost it. Faking a pregnancy would eventually have to come to an end at some point, and honestly after hearing some mess in this forum, I don't put anything past anyone anymore", "My sister in law did that when we finally got pregnant, through IVF, after years of infertility.  She announced on Christmas morning that she was 6 weeks pregnant with her second child and then the next day said she had a miscarriage overnight.  It was all a load of crap.  She just wanted to be the center of attention and was worried that my husband and I would get the attention instead of her.  Ironically, I HATE having attention on me.", "This was my first thought. Sister seems extremely spoiled and made snarky comments about OP throughout the wedding planning. I wouldn\u2019t put it past her to fake a pregnancy to have the attention on her and not OP.", "That's the first thing that I thought. \"Was she really pregnant?!\"", "While that's fun and cathartic in the short term, it's not a good strategy.  When my mum died, a few years after my dad so she was the last parental link for us, I could've unloaded on my siblings - would've been a hoot to make a stink at the funeral! - to let them know exactly how I felt about them after all the years of BS I endured with them.  Instead, I didn't say anything to any of them, and have not in the last almost ten years.  Let them think what they want: the titters will die out in a day or two, and if I don't provide fresh yeast for the conversation, it'll stay that way.", "Right? How hard would it have been to wait until OP was on the honeymoon?", "So sorry for your loss. Thank you for your kind words. And yes, my dad is fantastic!", "It wasn't on the wedding.  A mehndi is a pre wedding celebration.", "So true about the seagulls. They're fierce!\n\nYou should see the Scottish seagulls, twice the size and just as intent on those chips. Thugs! But we loved them.", "It bothers me that Circulay Quay should rhyme but doesn\u2019t", "NTA op.  lol! StJudesDespair - my husband and I were enjoying some hot chips at CQ once and occasionally throwing a piece to the gulls.  Once decided the good pickings were got by hovering over my left shoulder.  Another one decided to join him and I'll swear till the day I die that the first bird chacked at him to \"piss off!\"", "Makes sense!", "Eh, sis will just say she suffered a miscarriage or something. But you're absolutely right. None of that really matters in the present situation.", "That's my thought too.", "Ah, I was thinking what sis could have done to one-up OP on her wedding day, AFTER already anouncing a pregnancy before?? \n\n I think OP dodged a HUGE bullet by eloping...", "The major difference is that OP is losing other family aside from mom and sister by letting them set the narrative. At least if OP clears everything up, she can see which family members need cutting off because they support her mom even after knowing the truth.", "It was still my night. I don't want to sound selfish, but the attention was meant to be on me- the bride", "Wedding events. It\u2019s still an event where it\u2019s expected that the attention be on the couple. It\u2019s not as though the sister would\u2019ve had to wait months to announce. \n\nIt\u2019s the same as how it would be inappropriate to announce a pregnancy at your siblings wedding shower or bachelor/ette. It\u2019s an event that has a focal person and it\u2019s not appropriate to try and take that focus away.", "Yes but pretty much all the rest of the run up to the wedding and at the wedding the attention would all be on sister and her pregnancy things like oh you must be so excited you must of thought you'd never have a baby the first grandchild how exciting. OP'S wedding an afterthought. Sister back in the spotlight.", "Those Scottish seagulls are HUGE, they were bigger than the stray cat. I don\u2019t think I blinked once while eating my excellent chips. I was worried I may loose a finger with my chip. Now I\u2019m safely home I tell everyone that those seagulls are impressive.", "Gah! It really really shouldn't, because it's Circula***r*** Quay, and I just had a finger stutter! But, yes, I do pronounce it incorrectly in my head every time, because otherwise I'll use the wrong spelling - I had a *lot* of unimpressed things to say as a kid when I learned that Key West and Key Largo were spelled like that, but our Quays had to be all fancy and weird about their spelling.", "I bet the wedding was a miscarriage announcement in disguise.", "Sweetie, that\u2019s not selfish at all. It\u2019s your wedding. The people who aren\u2019t you/ your spouse who tried to make it about them are the ones who are selfish. I\u2019m glad your dad and your husband are so supportive. As for your mother and the wedding crashing entourage, they embarrassed themselves and it\u2019s their fault (not yours) that there\u2019s now gossip", "And the best thing is that it isn't even circular!", "NTA I'm so thankful you have a wonderful husband and a supportive father. Congratulations!", "GIRL, CONGRATULATIONS!! Even according to Islam, your simple wedding has far more barakah than the extravagant thing your mum planned. You won!", "NTA\n\nwelcome to Australia", "You'll feel better after blocking them all. Maybe not at first, but soon. \n\nThere's more than enough other people in the world, and a few of them are decent.\n\nYou got a good dad.\n\nNTA", "You\u2019re dad is an absolute legend. NTA. Sending good blessings for a long and happy marriage. Now enjoy your time in Australia!", "Ook one hand I think you should have communicated with your mother, and invited her to the eloping (though potentially banking your sister)\n\nOn the other hand the fact that your dad supported you says you probably have good cause\n\nIm going for NTA", "NTA. Your mom is more interested in money and her reputation than your wellbeing. You can think of the money she wasted as an asshole tax for treating you this way all these years. I would go LC or even NC with your sister. Enjoy your holiday.", "> I get that it\u2019s exciting, she is finally pregnant after how long with the first grandchild, but this was calculated, she purposely did this at my event.\n\nA cynical person might wonder if the announcement is genuine. Wait for tales of woe about a miscarriage after the wedding.", " NTA, your mum and sister are horrible. Btw weather has been amazing last two days", "NTA. That said, the polite thing would be to refund her the money lost in fees, as you were on board with the idea originally.", "Then maybe you should also reconsider your relationship with your mum who is very toxic. But I agree with others that no matter what happens next, you need therapy to help you. It becomes quite empowering once you realise that you don't need your parents approval and that you are your own person with your own family unit (husband).", "Well....let's say you just flew in to attend a wedding, booked a hotel etc and it was cancelled and you didn't even hear it from the couple...I bet you would be kind of mad about it too...\n\nNot saying she should have had the wedding, of course not. But at least have the decency the cancel it with a personal text.", "LMFAO when you said Auckland I literally facepalmed.  \n\n\rI'm probably the only one, but when you said you booked a flight to Sydney I thought you left like India or Bangladesh to put some real distance hahaha. \r\n\nI was imagining your Mom spamming you with messages over night from South Asia and you waking up and being like \\*delete\\* and enjoying the sun rise instead.\n\n\rAnyway congrats!", "With this timming? Not to be callous but she's obviously lying; later she would have a \"miscarriage\" and blame it on stress for OP not being supportive enough...", "The bin chickens and bush turkeys are also very bold!", "What was the family's reaction? Cause I can imagine anyone buying it..."]}
