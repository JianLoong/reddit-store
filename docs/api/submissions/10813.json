His behaviour hasnt changed - the method of *funding* his behaviour has. \n\nThat is what has triggered your disapproval, and rightly so.

Again, its not something they can control 'until' they made aware it is happening and only if they truly want to help themselves. \n\nWhen we get to a point in our relationships where we are focusing more on *being right* rather  than *making things right*, we will only go in circles.

ADHD.  Ask me how I know, lol.  \n\n\nShared finances in this situation will bring you nothing but heartache.  He is definitely not acting in a good way that will work for your relationship.  I seriously think you might need to re-assess how important this relationship is to you, because this behavior is not likely to change anytime soon, and will be a LOT of work to address as a couple.  \n\n\nBut why ESH?  I think going and selling his stuff behind his back is a dick move.  Is it fair what he did?  No.  But I think it's escalating the situation in an unhealthy way and creating MORE conflict by just jumping right to 'I'm selling your stuff without permission' instead of trying to find a plan together and a way forward that works for both of you, without acting in the heat of the moment.  By sitting down, and discussing things and setting a plan, you can avoid the drastic consequences and upset of someone feeling like you're violating their stuff and their choices without their consent.  Does he deserve it?  Doesn't matter; it's not a healthy way forward on your part, either, no matter how upset you are about the spent money.  \n\n\nIf it were me?  I'd definitely be disentangling the relationship to the point where we each had complete control over our own finances and then finding some agreement that works for both of us.  If there are shared bills, everybody contributes a pre-decided amount to a 'pool' where bills are paid from.  If ANYBODY is using any of that money for anything but shared bills, that arrangement is over, and I'd seriously look at separating at least that part of your lives.  (And if I were you, I'd insist to be the one to manage that, since he's already grossly mismanaged your shared funds and pre-decided agreement, it seems.)  If you still love this person despite these things and can find a way through it, it might be more ideal to set up a relationship plan where this can't be a problem -- ie, you deal entirely with your own finances; nothing you do or he does affects your stability and vice-versa.  (Living apart, even, if it comes to that.)  \n\n\nFrom there, if you still want to be together, and find ways to make it work, you can, but from a place of finding ways to love each other in healthy ways where boundaries already keep things stable, instead of trying to fix big conflicts that are already causing rifts and aren't likely to be repaired unless they're severely overhauled.  \n\n\nInteresting thought -- someone once said to me 'The hardest traits to forgive someone for are the traits that attracted you in the first place'.  While his behaviors of having many hobbies and jumping from one to another might have been appealing in the beginning, now that it's an actual problem for your relationship, it's really hard to forgive and work through.", "NTA.
