I'm like this too", "That is AWESOME!", "Don\u2019t add him to the account or give him the card, account number or password. \n\nIf your husband is this irresponsible, whether you leave or stay you need to learn to be more independent. There shouldn\u2019t be anything about your lives you can\u2019t handle yourself. If you don\u2019t work, you should think about looking, or setting up training/education to give you marketable skills.", "Yeah, ADHD would explain the short term interest in his various hobbies. It doesn't explain or excuse his smashing her phones and controlling her computer and phone use.", "This sounds like ADHD\u2026 I used to be like him and I remember once suddenly just buying a MacBook, and ended bored with it after a week. It sounds like he has really bad impulses, which I used to have, buying things without thinking and moving from hobby to another. My money situation was bad!! (ADHD tax)\nLuckily I broke down during the pandemic lockdown and sought help\u2026 turns out I have ADHD and started to take meds. While I still go from hobby to hobby, my meds are a game changer for helping with impulses, especially with shopping! I can proudly say now I can go into a store and NOT buy anything AND I can THINK before buying!!", "Read the part about how he puts screen limits on her phone and would smash a phone she brought home without his keylogger on it", "Idk but it makes me wanna go Grey Gardens, wait for a card in 5 years, and smile seeing that they found another person to take care of them like the infant they are. Id be happy - and be happy without having to take care of someone that I thought was going to be a partner. \n\nInstead they expect one partner to shoulder all the weight. \n\nOP is still managing but under his thumb like a prisoner. It\u2019s the other side of a very scary coin.", "> Internet time use was something my husband also controlled, he blocked certain sites, used screen time and hid my phones, not to mention that he always had to be in the same room while using it! Kind of like a parent control their kids devices. He always used the excuse of him paying for my phone so he controlled it against me. If I dare bought a new a phone and he found out he would smash it immediately. I was lucky enough to find my phone once he was gone.\n\nWTH OP... This is monstrously abusive!\n\nGet in contact with the police and start building a file... You don't have to press charges or something, but you *do* have to build a paper trail! \n\nAlso...

But also: use the internet more for your own good!", "You're in an abusive relationship.  he doesn't have to hit you for it to be abuse.  He's isolating and controlling you.

There are many partners out there who will treat you properly.", "Ok you\u2019re being abused. That is controlling and abusive. You\u2019re his wife, not child.", "Woah.  At first I was thinking of your husband as just some kind of irresponsible, impulsive goofball.  But no, this guy is an abusive, controlling monster!!  I would never treat my wife like this!!  You need to get away from this man asap!!!", "Um, I'm sorry, but what the fuck?", "Wait, what? He SMASHED your phone?! Oh my God! He's abusive! And why the heck was he controlling your Internet use? Blowing money you saved on hobbies and a boat was bad enough. But what you're describing here is even worse. Keep an eye on your credit in case he tries to open new cards or apply for loans in your name. Do not get back together with him.

Does anyone learn *and* get bored of crochet (as per one of her examples) in 2 weeks? Is he some boating, crocheting savant, and \nshe is only good \"at finances\" when she's selling things online...but making a bank deposit makes her go all floofy?", "Nta. \nI am so glad you're leaving. This asshole of a man is so abusive. He gives you the essential of a child lock on everything and the moment you fight back he destroys your shit or yells at you? \nAlso, does he let you have friends?

You need your own savings account. Do not put him on it. He does not sound responsible.", "The immaturity level in this marriage is off the charts. The husband picks up and abandons hobbies the same way a toddler does toys (actuallyworse, because toddlers have favourite toys), and the wife thinks this is adorable and keeps the mementos of these failed attempts to aquire a personality, so that they can reminisce about the memories later. \"Darling, look, I found the racquet you bought and then only used for three weeks, doesn't that bring back memories?\". They keep their emergency fund in a jar. He squanders their savings on frivolities and she preens herself on loving how \"not boring\" her husband is.\nOP, your husband isn't changing hobbies, he is unwilling or unable to commit to something and has zero impulse control. You loving that about him was a sign of your own  immaturity. You are now growing up. Congratulations.", "Info: who\u2019s money was in the jar? Because if you are working there\u2019s zero reason you shouldn\u2019t have access to your own money.

That would scare me to death.", "The short attention span, financial irresponsibility and compulsive behavior could also be attributed to mental illness.  Possibly bipolar.", "NTA you\u2019re being abused financially", "NTA, and read up on adult ADHD - constantly flitting between passions, an inability to plan ahead (which often shows up as being bad with money), and blaming you for everything are symptoms.

You need to have your paycheck direct deposited in a new account that you open RIGHT now.", "I know you said you\u2019re going to a bank to open an account and you\u2019re getting a new phone. Update us soon, please, because everyone here saying you\u2019re being financially abused is spot on\n\nETA: spelling", "Pendeja\u2026", "Hobby collecting like this sounds like Neurodiversity to me. It's very common in our community. As is being impulsive, bad with money and struggling with emotional regulation all of which you mention in this post. I'd say it's pretty likely he has ADHD and you should explore that with him.\n\nAs for the money, what he did is absolutely not ok. Bill money is bill money and that's it. I'd recommend opening a bank he does not have access to as he has shown that he can't be trusted with prioritising needs over wants. I have personal never mixed fiance's with a partner as I grew up with a father just like your hubby (I'm ND, so was my father, so is my son) and we were shit broke constantly, like I'm talking having to move every 6 months or more coz they wouldn't pay rent often enough. Get an account for you, an account for him and an account for shared expenses. Your income goes into your own account and bill money goes into the pool account.", " NTA! And I suggest your hubby gets evaluated for ADHD. Sounds like he might have it. Not saying that\u2019s a bad thing! But yeah.", "In a different bank too.", "So correlation does not equal causation but that\u2019s a common symptom of adhd and even ignoring possibility of mental illness, his behavior is harmful to himself and to you and he should speak with a psychologist bc that type of impulsivity is concerning. It could be something as simple as an unhealthy coping mechanism (retail therapy) or something stemming from past financial insecurity, idk, I don\u2019t know him and I\u2019m not a therapist, but I think he should see one, it can\u2019t hurt.", "How did it go, OP?", "Make sure it is with a different bank.\n\nSeen horror stories here of the people getting access to new accounts.", "I'm a lot like this too lol.\n\nI wanted to start a veggie garden last year so I went and found scrap wood/pallets around town. the biggest expense wouldve been soil.

You need to focus on taking care of yourself. He didn\u2019t allow you access to bank accounts, phones or computers. He is abusive and a master manipulator.

Sounds a lot like me.\n\nOP, is he abnormally forgetful? Does he stop paying attention part way through conversations? Is he severely disorganised, untidy and loses things frequently? Does he have trouble doing things such as chores within a reasonable timeframe? Does he struggle to follow through with commitments such as attending events or keeping promises?\n\nTake a look at the symptoms of ADHD, especially inattentive type. It is definitely plausible that he\u2019s undiagnosed, but you know him best. Good news is that if it turns out this is a symptom of undiagnosed ADHD then there is plenty of help out there in the form of therapies, coping strategies and medication to help him.\n\nEDIT: saw some of your other comments about how controlling he is and about him smashing your phone. Ignore what I said above, he can figure it out himself. Get out if you can. Perhaps he does have ADHD, but even if he does it is irrelevant. He is abusive.", "Yup, I relate.

It can get tempting to blow some money on a new interest but I know it\u2019s just gonna lead to regret later on over how stupid that purchase was.

OP didn't realise it was a sign of abuse.", "Ok the crochet thing,  yeah very possible. It sounds like ADHD hyperfixations. \n\nAlso don't discount conditioning.  From the sound of it she has an account but that he has full control of.  Hence the jar money.  It's also possible given his behaviours that he's made her think that having a bank account is something scary to her as a control thing.", "She explicitly said in a comment that she didn't have a bank account (complete with an exclamation mark), and she also said that the jars were for their 1000's of dollars of emergency fund. And she only freaked out the third time she noticed they were getting low when he emptied them completely to buy some boat. \n\nIt does sound like she is being financially abused somehow, but I don't understand the knowledge gaps around the obvious stuff with her knowledge of more \"difficult\" things. And usually if someone is being financially held hostage, they wouldn't be \"allowed\" access to sell their abusers things. \n\nMaybe I'm hyperfocused on this, but I can't wrap my head around:\n\n\"Sell things online--easy!\"\n\n\"Open a bank account--I don't know how!\"\n\nI feel like she's telling me she can make waffles but doesn't understand how to make toast. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f"]}
