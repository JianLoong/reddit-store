You not \"not supporting his hobbies\" you're upset at his stealing. Those are communal funds he's using for his own personal enjoyment. Selling them and the boat would be the least of what I'd do.

This is a huge red flag from your husband.  He can't just make expensive purchases without consulting you.

You should definitely bring up the fact that he said he would replace the money he borrowed, and he has only taken more since.  He might be a shopaholic, and might need therapy for it.

Seeing your husbands actions as communication rather than purely a behaviour is one way to go about this. His behaviour hasnt changed - the method of *funding* his behaviour has. \n\nThat is what has triggered your disapproval, and rightly so. He will defend this because thats the natural state to go into when we feel *caught*. Defense mode. Especially someone who tends to feed off of dopamine...they take this kind of criticism as personal attacks (look up RSD). Again, its not something they can control 'until' they made aware it is happening and only if they truly want to help themselves. \n\nWhen we get to a point in our relationships where we are focusing more on *being right* rather  than *making things right*, we will only go in circles. There will never be resolution. It needs to be a couple against the problem, not a couple against one another.
