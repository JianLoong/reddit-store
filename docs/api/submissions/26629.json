But actual, well placed doubt about who your fiance is and how she treats people who have differences? That's a hard no.\n\nHonestly, after 21+ years of marriage, I wish more people would stop and reconsider in situations like yours. Marriage can be beautiful. And brutal. But divorce is almost always harder. Among my friends, even the easiest divorces left real scars. The hardest divorces left roadmaps of them. They've all recovered, that's human nature, but don't set yourself up to have to go through that.", "NTA. That\u2019s a HUGE red flag. And I feel a lot of people know about Down syndrome so I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an excuse. Regardless, what she said was hurtful and I don\u2019t think I\u2019d feel comfortable having someone in my life who makes comments like that. And don\u2019t pay the deposit back, not your fault their daughter is insensitive", "NTA\n\nRed flag!  Red flag!\n\n You were planning to spend the rest of your life with her, and she has given you warning that she will not accept your brother as a \"real person.\"\n\nDon't rush into anything with this woman. \n\nJust because you love someone doesn't mean they are the right person for you to commit your life to.\n\nPlease let us know what you decide - either way.\n\nHugs and Good Luck", "Guessing that she has met your family including your brother, so he is not a surprise... also guessing that a word beginning with r was used. \n\nNTA \n\ngo hug your brother, he just saved you from a major life mistake.

It is perfectly reasonable to put things on hold. It sounds like she is showing who she really is, and that should be very concerning.", "NTA I am assuming that since you were marrying this girl she has gotten to know your family and met your brother several times?\n\nThe only reason I could think of for her to have this attitude is that she is upset that some of her wedding pictures will not fit the dream scenario she has in her head, which for me is enough reason to call off the wedding if she is that shallow.", "NTA- You did the right thing.  What if you went ahead and married her knowing how she felt. Your family would be saying that you are such an asshole for marrying her knowing how she is.\n\nSo what do you do? Piss off 1 girlfriend or an entire family?", ">My parents feel I should not be so hard on her cause Down Syndrome is widely understood.\n\nWhat did you mean by this comment above? Is there a typo here?\n\nNTA in the general conflict, and for cancelling the wedding.\n\n--->But for the question of the deposit, you should pay half and then move on from all of this with a clear conscience.", "NTA.  I can't believe this behavior.  How dare she!  What kind of person makes comments like that?  I think calling the wedding off was an excellent idea.  I can't imagine being married to someone like that.", "I think this depends on the actual comment. In my opinion not enough info so I\u2019m guessing NTA but cannot be absolutely sure.", "NTA. She waved a huge red flag in your face and you'd be stupid to marry her without first thinking it all over very carefully.\n\nAnd I don't think not understanding about Down's Syndrome is an excuse. Decent people wouldn't say anything bad whether they understood or not.", "NTA.  My great uncle had Downs. That was like 90 years ago.  Your parents are trying to excuse rotten behavior but man I would think twice.  Her parents can get back the deposit or they can reschedule for whenever she marries someone else.", "NTA, this is not a new behavior, it is just the first time you saw it.  IF you are in the US, people with DS are not hidden away.  They have rolls in movies, have jobs and many live independent lives.  You called off the wedding because she hid her bigotry against your brother until the wedding was being planned.  Be happy that you found out her true feelings before you said I DO.", "She just showed you exactly who she is.\n\nWhat you do with this information now is up to you.\n\nI certainly know what I would do.", "NTA.\n\nIt doesn't take a huge education or major mental adjustment to understand that you should be kind. If she was deliberately unkind, you're right; you should reassess whether you want to be with an unkind woman who badmouths your brother with Downs Syndrome just because she's not getting her way with a detail of this wedding.\n\nIf she said something insensitive or obtuse without any malice, that's something else entirely.\n\nAs for the deposit, someone else suggested half, and that would be better than all or nothing in my opinion.", "NTA. You're not costing them anything; her cruelty is. She can pay them back. You're dodging a bullet if you break it off.", "NTA\n\nYou dodged a bullet. Pay them back and be done with the whole lot of them.", "Info needed. I think it depends on what the comment actually was. Was it something completely ignorant and perhaps she didn\u2019t realize how it sounded because she is not fully educated, or was it straight up insulting without question?", "I know I'm going to get downvoted, but even so, I'm going to defend the gf.\n\nWe don't KNOW what she said. Until he gives details, I won't say she's the asshole.\n\nI'll assume she questioned the choice being that the brother has Downs and that she said the \"R\" word. Even with that assumption, I still don't believe she's an asshole.\n\nI think it's a fair to question his choice, especially if it's not something he's brought up with her previously, which it doesn't sound like it was.\n\nI'm sure, as many women do, she's thought about what her wedding would be like for years. Even if not, she started to plan it after getting engaged. Since his choice wasn't discussed with her, I'm sure she made some natural assumptions about her wedding.\n\nThere are high-functioning people with Downs and there are low-functioning. The guy did not tell us where his brother falls on that spectrum. That's an important detail.\n\nNormally, the best man handles planning the bachelor's party if there is one. He often helps to coordinate checking out tuxes and helps support the groom with his part of any wedding prep and duties and getting ready on the big day. He will be the counterpart for the maid of honor, walking with her down the aisle. He sits at the head table and usually makes a speech at the reception. And he's able to participate in the often times tedious taking of photos, before, during and after the ceremony. (Of course not every best man does all of these things for every wedding.)\n\nI don't think it's being an asshole at all to question his choice when she's likely assumed there would be a man in that position who would be able to step up and do all those things. Is he going to be able to walk her MoH down the aisle and patiently stand during the ceremony? Is he going to be able to deal with all the photo taking the Best Man would be normally be expected to participate in? Is he going to be able to give the speech his role normally gives? Is he going to be able to sit at the head table... is he going to be able to feed himself if he is there? Does he have any inappropriate behaviors?\n\nAnd it might be a princess question, but I think a fair one at your own wedding nonetheless, is he going to take the spotlight off her/them if he needs a lot of care and attention?\n\nWhile he might not have question or objected to any of her choices, it WOULD make her the asshole if he did and she said too bad, suck it up, \"end of story\" like he said to her. It's both their weddings. He should have discussed his choice and talked about what they might need to tweak because of it and what she is or isn't ok with. Because just as much as you think she's the asshole for questioning the choice, I think he's one for telling her she's not allowed to question it.\n\nI believe there is a very valid discussion to be had in regards to someone with mental challenges taking such a role in a wedding and reception, but he shut it immediately down. He's obviously sensitive and defensive about his brother. I find it very strange they got past the engagement and to the point vendors have been paid and he's never talked to her about his brother being best man. I feel that's quite unfair to her. Maybe she'd have been ok with his choice if she'd have been able to process it and pivot from what's normally taken for granted at a wedding. I think that's quite a surprise to have sprung on her and then basically tell her to shut up and sit down.\n\nIt's very valid to question his choice and what it means for the wedding. Are there to be accommodations to be made? Does it need to be arranged that there is a room set aside if it becomes too much for him? Weddings are a looooong day, especially for the people in the bridal party. Does he need a special plate as they often have food sensitivities? There are a lot of very valid things to question and discuss.\n\nHe's the asshole for shutting that immediately down.\n\nAlso, if you're willing to call off a wedding because she said the \"r\" word once, I wouldn't want to marry you anymore if I were her. The brother is the literal definition of that word. Maybe she's unaware that it's considered offensive nowadays or maybe she simply slipped. I grew up with it being the word used, and it's an unthinking part of my vocabulary. I've used it a few times and had to correct myself the last several years. My best friend has a child with mental challenges and she grew up with that word too. She's slipped and used it while talking to me about her own son and with certainty she wasn't being malicious.  \n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMy judgement is with the information given, which is not enough, YTA for not allowing for it to be a discussion. It's her wedding too. You don't get to make unilateral decisions that affect her without allowing the space to discuss. Also, for not ever mentioning it previously, as I'm sure it's not something that came to your mind in a spur of the moment just then, and allowing her the time to adjust to a big change from a typical wedding. Also, for telling her she's not allowed to question you. Also, for calling off a wedding for her having a valid reason to question things and for presumably using the \"r\" word for the first time since knowing her. Anyone can make an honest slip.\n\nYTA, I hope if you decide to go through with it that she tells you to get bent.", "ESH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nit is better for both of you to cancel the wedding and break up.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She may have been hiding her dislike(?) or aversion to your brother and his role in your life thinking that it will change after you are married.  If you still love her I suggest that you sit down and have a conversation with her (if you believe she will be honest ) and ask her about what she was thinking about what she said?  How she really feels and does she intend to keep you at a distance from your brother and family?
