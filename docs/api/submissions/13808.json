You can critique & abhor a behavior without ridiculing the child.\n\n2) she's a teen. They're naturally rebellious.  Is it possible that you have a mini rebellion brewing or fully underway? It's a natural part of life. Just remind her of your expectations & let it go.\n\n3) as the parent it's your job to socialize her. But things such as please & thank you should've taken place at like 2-3 yrs old. So I wonder how is she with others? I constantly remind my child (8yrs old) to say please & thank you. But apparently he does it with EVERYONE  else, because I'm constantly told how delightful & polite he his & how great his manners are. I think its a \"love means never having to say you're sorry\" thing. Although for many its nice to hear the \"sorry\" from your love ones. You like hearing please & thank you. So unless she never does it with anyone,  i'd gently remind her AND make it appoint to say please & thank you when talking with her. \n\nBecause great manners go both ways & children learn by example.", "YTA.\n\nAlso autism has EVERYTHING to do with it! Autism often is the driving force when people don't understand social cues and niceties. What you consider \"basic manners\" doesn't always make sense to someone who doesn't fully understand social cues.\n\nYou have to TEACH someone who clearly isn't aware of social cues and social interaction that \"this is what we do.\" You make it a routine which btw helps autistic people because we feel some sort of control when we know x y z comes after a b c.\n\nYou had 17yrs to help her understand in her way of what social niceties, cues and expectations of social situations means and what you do in them.\n\nYou failed parenting her and now is wanting to blame her for your failings.

Hello, I\u2019m someone with autism and asperges. I struggle with formalities and the pleases and thank yous. Not saying \u201cplease\u201d is not rude, it\u2019s just not overly polite. My entire way of speaking is very direct and to the point, I find these words to be a waste and pointless, they should just be implied. If I\u2019m asking for something in a respectful tone and not in a moody, entitled way, then that is still good enough, that is not rude. However, I do also use them in structured scenarios. For example, when I get my food from the kitchen, which happens every day at the same time, I thank my father for cooking it. This is a routine, something us autistic people rely on a lot of the time, and therefore I merge the action of taking food from the same place at the same time with saying \u201cthank you\u201d. So yes, I do think she has said pleases and thank yous before even if you didn\u2019t realise it.\n\nMy parents did raise me to be polite, but growing up I never grasped the idea of needing to use them because if everyone just expected super-politeness, then that\u2019s exhausting.

You told that she was rude and it was nothing to do with her autism. Do you know that? Do you know how autism works? It sounds like it very much is linked to that and to social awkwardness.

If you want to be a parent or teacher, you need to approach people, especially children, from a place of understanding. Calling your kid a bad person is kind of fucked up if you haven\u2019t already done everything in your power to teach them, and they aren\u2019t doing anything horrible. Approach topics like this by addressing the *behavior itself* as morally wrong, but first listen to what they have to say on struggles they\u2019re having, and *help them* figure out ways to overcome what\u2019s making it difficult for them. You need to be on their side, and calling them a bad person is not only far from taking their side, I might call it emotional abuse and neglecting of your duty as a parent. You might see some of these things as minor, but I promise you, bring a child and having the only person in the world you rely on and trust call you a bad person, is going to really hurt, and over prolonged periods can cause long lasting trauma that could affect them for the rest of their life without therapy.\n\nEdit: also, if you\u2019ve done this and you\u2019ve both genuinely made an effort and your child still is unable to do it, you have to take your child\u2019s side and consider that maybe their autism genuinely does affect their ability to do what you\u2019re asking of them.", "YTA.

I have been diagnosed with ADHD, not autism, but I am pretty sure that I am also somewhere on the spectrum, for a number of reasons.

It can just feel so awkward, so excruciating, so impossible to say what seems like something very simple and easy. But it's just--not. Sometimes it's fine and it is simple for me to do. Sometimes I can force myself to do it. Sometimes I can't. The weight of how excruciating it feels is just too much. And knowing that I should be able to say something, knowing that not being able to say it is making things awkward, just makes me more anxious and uncomfortable and makes the whole thing worse. \n\nI don't think you are correct that it's not tied to her autism. If she could easily do what you are asking, she would. She clearly cares about being rude or she wouldn't have been upset by what you said. So there's obviously a reason that she doesn't always do it, and she told you: she feels awkward and uncomfortable. It seems like this very well could be, and probably is, related to her autism. She will need to work on it, because you are right that it could lead to her being perceived as rude and cause problems for her. But you insulting her and telling her it has nothing to do with her autism when you have no basis for thinking that's the case except your assumptions is not helpful.

Your daughter sounds like she has a PDA (Pathological Demand Avoidance) profile. \n\nAvoiding the demands of our everyday life is a normal human trait we've all experienced at some point. But for autistic people (or people with an otherwise dysregulated nervous system), this is something that actually impacts their daily functioning. \n\nNow, what am I talking about when I say \"demands\"? We oftentimes think of the word \"demand\" as someone else requiring something of us -- and it does include that -- but they also include things like laws, social rules, promises, even our wants and needs. You can think of it as anything that requires someone to expend energy in a way that may not be preferable to them at that time. For example: you can wake up really hungry, but you're not in the mood to make food. That becomes a demand. While eating is a basic human need, it becomes a stressor at that time because it's not where the person wants to spend their energy. \n\nNow, for someone with a PDA profile, their sympathetic nervous systems are more easily aroused than the average person. This means that to them, DEMANDS feel like THREATS. Experiencing demands very easily puts them into a fight-or-flight response. As silly as it might sound, a person with a PDA profile may view something like doing the dishes as a literal threat to their survival. It's not logical. They're not sitting there consciously thinking \"Oh, this is a threat to my survival.\" It is purely a nervous system response because they are more easily aroused into fight-or-flight due to their disability. It stems from the idea that there is something being demanded of them, and if they don't meet that demand correctly, their safety is in jeopardy.\n\nWhat does this have to do with your daughter? Well, saying \"please\" and \"thank you\" in certain situations is a widespread social expectation. Following social norms and cues are things that are demanded of us by society. If we don't follow the rules right, we are shunned. And to someone with PDA, that prospect is ESPECIALLY scary. \n\nYour daughter likely doesn't have the knowledge to be able to communicate this to you, or understand this is what she's going through. It's not because she's trying to be rude, or lazy, or that she's trying to misbehave. All she understands is that certain things make her feel scared and uncomfortable for some reason she can't explain. \n\nThe first step to overcoming PDA is understanding it. Understand that what it comes down to is that your daughter isn't feeling safe, and she just needs help working through that.

It\u2019s ableist to expect teaching a neurodivergent child with a neurotypical method and then calling the child names and chastising them is OK. It\u2019s ableist to assume a person with a disability is choosing not to do something to be spiteful/rude that they may either be incapable of doing or have difficulty doing.", "I never said her autism is irrelevant, I acknowledge that she's likely making these slip ups by accident.

You had a conversation with her, and she got angry. Maybe she had a meltdown? Are you the asshole for causing your daughter to melt down while trying to \"help\" her? Yeah, probably.\n\nSometimes when we argue with people, we are really having two arguments. One is about the specific thing, and one is about a general problem. You've mentioned in your post that you don't think she says please and thank you enough, to ** you**. **You** know she has autism, and **you** know this is hard for her, so why does this bother **you**?\n\nYou're welcome to say \"well I'm concerned people will think she's rude\", and that's fine. Do you think she's being rude to you, knowing what you know about her, and how she communicates? If you do think that, you're ignoring the fact that she's on the spectrum. Also, you're covering it with \"other people will think a negative thing about you.\"\n\nIf you don't think she's being rude to you, what made you bring this up to her now? How long has this been a problem? Why is it worse now? What has changed? If there's a specific issue, talk to her about it. \"Hey, your teacher said that you seemed really rude because you didn't thank him for putting extra time to help you study.\" Did she tell you she wants to work on this, or is it not important to her?\n\nI want to be clear: I agree with you that people might think she's rude if she's not doing this. They also might not notice. If I'm feeding you a poop sandwich, it doesn't matter how nice the bread around it is. There are many ways to be kind, and there are many ways to be rude.

I took many trainings about autism and learning disabilities and one of the things that SLT were always mentioning is that phrases such as \"thank you\" and \"please\" may be challenging as they may do not have a real meaning for the person. Gratitude is often expressed by smile, eye contact, involvement, etc, instead of words.\n\nThere are also other sides. Imagine that for your daughter, communication with a neurotypical person is like a suitcase. They have to carry on not only words but also social norms that for us are natural, recognition of emotions that for us is natural, etc. Interaction with other humans may be challenging and complicated, at least. Now, everything in the suitcase has its place, and your daughter must know where it is to communicate in an efficient and effective way. I understand that expressing gratitude and saying please is very important due to social norms and expectations, but maybe you are overloading her suitcase? Finding space for please and thank you isn't impossible but may require time and work.", "NTA! These basic courtesies will help her get goodwill from people.

You say that you have already taught her, but children and teens with autism require more time to practice these things.

This of course is not universally true - there are well -mannered but quite bad people. However, it tends to be a good rule of thumb that will be accurate enough for the majority of interactions most people have. So if I get stopped on the street and asked for directions, for example, how much help I'm willing to provide will depend in a large part on how polite the other person is because why would I want to engage in an interaction that isn't pleasant? And in a typical week, where I have dozens of interactions that five minutes or less, generally the only information I have to go on is looks and manners. \n\nFor people who you see more often, manners are a quick way of saying \"I respect and appreciate you\" - you've noticed that your grandma and mom are in a better mood when you use manners. I guess my question is, if you appreciate and care for someone, wouldn't you want them to find interacting with you to be a mostly positive experience? If you know using please and thank you makes them feel good, don't you want the people you care about to feel good? \n\nBecause right now, it seems like the only time you care about their emotional state is when you can benefit from it. For me (and what maybe you're missing?), I want people, especially people I care about, to feel respected and appreciated when they interact with me, just like I want to feel respected and appreciated when I interact with them. And that could get really complex - different people feel respected and appreciated by different things! But manners, these small, useful words, can be used to convey the sentiments of \"I respect and appreciate you\" very quickly and to anyone in your culture. That's why the social contract exists. To help convey small, meaningful things that make interacting with each other - a necessity to live - more pleasant, and therefore easier. \n\nIn your road analogy, the straight direct road, for many people, is full of potholes and you always run the risk of having to slam on the brakes. It's more direct but it's not a more enjoyable ride. The medium road with more turns is paved smoothly and you almost never need to slam on the brakes.", "Okay, thanks for explaining that. I hate to admit that I'm still confused though. So basically she just doesn't want to say please and thank you bc she doesn't want to for whatever reason, and the fact that it's seen as a required according to neurotypical/societal norms makes her push back on conforming to them since they make her feel like she's putting effort into faking herself?\n\nIn hindsight, this probably explains so much about myself. I don't think I ever really bothered to mask myself, which is why I probably found myself friends with the \"weird\" group in school. I've never been a particularly social person so I've never cared about fitting in:reading was always more important to me. Now I wonder how I would have been if I made more of an effort to \"fit in\" with the students around me by masking.", "Well, idk about her specifically.

You may have a notion of her worldview and life story, since it is directly influenced by yours, but you do not know her thoroughly,  just as she cannot know you back entirely.\n\nCommunication is a two-way street.", "Of course. But it's not always easy. And being called rude is likely to trigger a shut down before it clicks as a reminder. Op just needs to approach it differently.", "That's true, but patience, understanding and care is a better way to get her to conform to these things.", "For my daughter, who is perfectly functional and works two jobs, \"please\" and \"thank you\" just don't come naturally. And she *hates* that. Makes her feel bad every time. For her, it is a major mask. She sure tries.", "Ugh your coworkers suck, you are doing fine. I understand that feeling when you are talking to a person and it feels like you are being a bjrden to yhem brcause of non verbal cued but you try to fight that and it's not your fault. My own voice and demeanor has become zombie like fue to health issues. And people understand that for the most part. I wouldn't say your coworkers behavior is normal, unless we've come to a point where being an asshole is normalized.", "Thank you. I actually read your first comment that you had made a podcast. Whoops. :) \n\nI have OCD and highly suspected ADHD (per my psych, I just need to do the eval) so I'm not working with a NT brain either. Idk if it's helping or damaging things for my kid. While she also has ADHD, there are a lot of places we really differ. The things i mask are not always the same things she does. She also made the decision almost a year ago that she's going to mask at the bare minimum and people can deal or F off. Which has helped her so much, but she still feels awful when she comes off as rude. \n\nI'll check out the sources. Thank you so much.\n\nEdit to clarify that the OCD is confirmed and being treated. Just not the possible ADHD.", "I agree with that.\n\nIt is interesting too, because in these teachings we can also make people manipulative.  \"we do this because if we say these kinds of things people will like and trust us\".\n\nVery challenging, and it does get tiring, but its important for her to learn.  One thing I would say is that it is very easy for autistic people and people with disabilities to use their diagnoses as tools to manipulate others.  My interpretation here is that it is most likely a combination of both - partly it is an autistic challenge and partly it is a kid being a kid using her diagnoses to push back against a reasonable request for her level of function.\n\nThe reason why I am  sympathetic to the mother is that I have learned not to focus on semantics in these situations.  I interpreted \"you are a rude person\" as a genuine attempt by the mother to apply a higher level of importance and urgency to the child, for a change that will have long term benefits to the child and her family, and everyone she comes across.  I don't think there is much of a difference between \"you are a rude person\" and \"this behavior is rude\".  In effect, they are the same thing.  People who exhibit selfish or rude behaviors are seen, especially by those they don't know well, as selfish and rude.\n\nSo I just disagree that the mother is being an asshole. Everything else you say I agree with, but I would also add the very real chance that there is a degree of manipulation and normal human behavior involved by the child to avoid taking on a new tool.", "It may also be possible that the child is being selfish and manipulative, just like any other child, and rejecting efforts to change, just like any other child.\n\nI am a special needs educator and I have autism.  Adults in young peoples lives need to maintain high and reasonable standards so they can have successful adult lives.\n\nI support her mother in her efforts, and if other adults don't, even if they say the most understanding and caring things, then they are actually harming the child while trying to be nice.  \n\nIn fact, it can be difficult for parents to get feedback on behaviors at school or to have other adults cooperate in maintaining high standards, because the people who are supposed to do that don't.  They care.  They excuse or dilute descriptions of behaviors that negatively affect other kids, and that will in turn negatively affect the kid they are \"caring\" for in the long run.  Through this way of \"caring\" and a certain degree of cowardice due to social-political considerations, they actually do harm.", "Autistic person and I disagree.\n\nThe focus can not by default be on the autistic persons needs and challenges.  We are all humans and autistic people and kids with disabilities can be just as selfish and manipulative as anyone else, and in fact sometimes moreso.\n\nIt serves nobody to undermine a mother who is setting reasonable expectations that are within the capacity of the child.  \"caring\" and \"understanding\" and \"love\" do not equate to good development and a successful adulthood for people with their own challenges.\n\nWhat is worse is that people who should be maintaining high standards don't. There is a social-political tendency to reward people who say caring things, and a great feat in educators and adults when it comes to criticizing or having higher standards for kids with disabilities.\n\nThat doesnt help anyone.  It doesnt help the kid.  It doesnt help the parents.  It absolutely does not help the kid in their adult life.", "There are times when I'm exhausted and sad and a lot of other things, and a simple thank you for even the most basic thing has made me feel appreciated and so much better. I try to channel that in the way I behave as well. Perhaps you don't ever feel that way, but someone in your home might. It means that you didn't take what they did for granted. I'm not saying that not saying it means you are taking them for granted, but rather that saying it means you aren't, if that makes sense.", "I completely fail to see not just how our visions differ, but where they coincide. I did not claim we shouldn't ask autistic people to have a basic notion of caring and courtesy. What I am advocating for, at the root of my argument, is communication leading to understanding. One of my biggest problems, both as someone who is neurodivergent and as someone who has suffered of and because of mental illness, is the belief that people are stagnant and that depression/adversity is inescapable. It takes work. But when dealing with matters of society and relationships, the effort must go both ways.\n\nThat, of course, in general. \n\nIn this particular case, and given the fact that OP outright insulted not one but BOTH daughters in an apparently now-deleted comment, I am skeptical of the claim that manners have been taught with proper care and consideration for neurodivergencies or even for different learning styles", "INFO:\n\n>Because she hates me, she's said that before. She'll be nice when mannerly to her friends but not me (or strangers)\n\nSo it's NOT about manners. YOU feel like she doesn't tell YOU please and thank you enough. This has nothing to do with her autism or her manners and others thinking she is rude, is it?\n\nIt's about you feeling appreciated and even loved by your kid? \n\nOP, you sound like you have a giant chip on yor shoulders. You sound like you resent your kid, and that you think yo know it all just because you raised her. Have you talked to professionals? Gone to parenting classes? You sound like you can also benefit from talking to a therapist to help you with your emotions.\n\nYour child says she has discomfort with it and your comment (from your replies) when asked if YOU ASKED HER WHY  was:\n\n>No, but why should i, it's just a simple mannerly word.\n\nYou sound like you think you know it all. You don't. You don't have a clue what's going on in your kid's head because you talk AT her, not with her.\n\nPlease talk to a therapist. You need help to see that there is a better way to parent what whatever it is is you're doing now.", "the thing is, your daughter clearly isn\u2019t rude. she is not doing it to *be* rude, nor has she expressed in any way that she is simply spoiled or ungrateful. she has, though, expressed that she is clearly too anxious to participate in neurotypical conversation norms. that is *very* much tied to her autism, actually. even if it weren\u2019t, other people\u2014even you\u2014aren\u2019t owed verbal gratitude from her, no matter how much they might crave it. if she suffers from social anxiety, and it soothes her to skip those surface-level pleasantries, that\u2019s not the worst thing in the world. \n\na nice person is not necessarily a kind person; as long as she is good and kind, why do you care?\n\nedit: you can absolutely nicely ask for things without saying \u201cplease\u201d, and can express gratitude without saying \u201cthank you\u201d", "YTA you apparently don\u2019t actually understand autism.

Some things are more important than whether or not your child says \u201cplease\u201d", "Hi, OP, I'm a college student on the autism spectrum. Autism absolutely has something to do with it. \n\nShe knows her manners it sounds like, but different autistic folk function differently, and she may not be able to just get over it in some cases. It is not your job to shame her for it if she genuinely isn't intentionally doing it. \n\nI have family who has your POV, that I can just get over it and be a \"proper\" adult. Just get over my faults, my food aversion (that can and will cause gagging if I'm even smelling something I have aversion to), my lack of social cues, my need of a consistent routine. To get over my needs and what my brain is telling me, but most of us can't do that easily.\n\nWe mask our differences to try to fit in, and I have things that I can't mask. If I'm anxious, I'll stim with my hoodie strings or continually crack my fingers until they're sore. I know my manners but sometimes my brain forgets that it's common courtesy to say \"thank you\" or to add a \"please\" when asking for something at the table, it's not intentional in most cases and if it is it's likely because I was overwhelmed and wasn't thinking. \n\nYTA. I don't know if you mentioned your age, but stigmas and rumors are a huge source of harm towards the autistic community of folks, so I'd suggest you to just be open minded towards her struggles too. Communicate if you feel under appreciated. Just talk to her, bluntly but respectfully. If she feels disrespected by you being too blunt, then that's another conversation.", "OP, I'm autistic, and my daughter reminded me to say please and thank you when she was little. And, I did. I did it out of respect, and I did it to demonstrate that I can take feedback and change. You're not an asshole. I think teenagers can just be contrarian. Maybe try to tell your daughter how those statements make people feel good. Like \"When you say thank you, it makes people feel like you're grateful, and it makes the exchange pleasant\". When I stared realizing that communication affects the other person and it affects me, it really made me more open to feedback. It's also helped me be more successful over time, and I bet that's what you're also worried about. I hope your daughter listens.", "NTA", "YTA mostly for the way you phrase it. If you call her a *rude person*, she's going to be more likely to internalize that it's a part of who she is-- something immutable. If you call it *rude behavior*, that's something that can be changed.\n\nThis is a common issue with messaging when it comes to girls, just culturally. Girls are often told \"you *are* this way, you *are* that way\" while boys are often told \"you *do* this, you *do* that\" and over time, it becomes ingrained and girls have more trouble with believing they're capable of self-improvement.", "I agree that your daughter\u2019s autism is not a good reason for her to not say please and thank you. \n\nBut if you wanted your daughter to have good manners you needed to teach her them.

I sometimes use it but I don't get it. It doesn't add anything to the request. How the request is asked is more important to me than whether you use a specific word. You can ask rudely while still saying please, and ask politely while not saying please at all.\n\nExpressing gratitude I do get and I do think is important, but I'm interested if there are other ways she expresses gratitude that are more meaningful to her.", "Her autism has \\*everything\\* to do with it. For her, an automatic 'please' and 'thank you' probably feels forced and inauthentic, and yeah that kind of stuff will make her feel physically uncomfortable to do. I had to train myself to do them as an adult and it's a well ingrained habit now but definitely wasn't as a teen. Like small talk, I simply did not see the point of automatic things like that if I didn't really mean it and I'm guessing she's the same. It doesn't make her rude, ungrateful, disrespectful. It just means she approaches interactions differently.

So it was weird to see how much my scored differ to being \"less\" ADHD than before.\n\nIt really is a lot of NTs want this. Like I got from overly happy to like a robot. Just very monotone. It always has upset my coworkers because \"you are usually so happy\" Like um I'm happy? Just not the way you want me to be happy.\n\nIt", "That's not research lmfao. Actual doctors have done research and state that the use of please and thank you is difficult for autistics because it's a social cue. You sound bitter.", "Bullshit lmao", "I am sure she has, doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t be explained again and again until the child gets it.", "That\u2019s not true at all. I care about people, but I can\u2019t read people\u2019s emotions like a NT person would, which is the crux of the issue. \n\nImagine being told a dozen times a day that you don\u2019t care about people because you don\u2019t understand the behaviors you\u2019re supposed to be doing, and tell me how you wouldn\u2019t just give up? I figured out a long time ago that my mother would do x thing if I did y thing, but I never understood why I would be yelled at if I failed to do y thing. Why failing to do that meant I didn\u2019t care. The thing is, I cared a lot, but the ways I displayed that never seemed to matter. The harder I tried, the less I understood what was going wrong. Eventually, I did stop caring about it. I love my mum. But I don\u2019t care how she feels anymore because I have no way to tell, and failing to get it right means that \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d anyways, so why bother?\n\nYou\u2019re coming at this entire thing with the assumption that all autistic people can correctly identify mood from behavior, and understand the principles behind why certain behaviors elicit certain responses. We don\u2019t. We didn\u2019t have the social interaction playbook, because we weren\u2019t able to read the reactions to the behaviors we aren\u2019t supposed to be doing. \n\nMy ENTIRE POINT is that OP is coming at this wrong. That a lot of people are. Because you know what helps a lot? Explaining things outside of \u201cbecause it does some arbitrary thing that it\u2019s clearly not doing.\u201d No one thinks I\u2019m asking for a book to be handed to me out of malice. That\u2019s absurd and completely illogical. All OP needs to do is actually explain these things.\n\nWant to know what finally got me to start saying thank you regularly? To start thinking about it more? A professor explained that it\u2019s like when I drew my friend a bear skull, but with 100% less effort, so when someone does something big for me (like handing me a semester\u2019s worth of studying materials and offering to tutor me), a drawing that took 27 hours is excellent! But when someone hands me something or points out a mistake so I can fix it before turning something in, \u2018thank you\u2019 saves me the time and effort of trying to find a way to pay it back, because it lets them know that I\u2019ll be willing to do the same for them in the future. It\u2019s a tit-for-tat promise; you helped me minutely, and I\u2019ll help you in that way. THIS makes sense. \u201cIt makes people feel good\u201d or \u201cit tells people you\u2019re not bad\u201d doesn\u2019t. It doesn\u2019t connect.", "Exactly! The issue I have with OP\u2019s post is because she\u2019s trying to teach through repetition, which is only making her daughter feel further isolated for not understanding it. \n\nI care a lot about the people around me, and when they say I\u2019m rude and don\u2019t care because I don\u2019t behave in the ways they want me to instinctively/through repetition, then I just learned it wasn\u2019t worth caring for them, because I was just going to mess it up anyways. The only thing repetition taught me was how to manipulate my mother into helping me with things she wouldn\u2019t otherwise, because she was telling me through positive reinforcement that she liked it X way but not Y way. I didn\u2019t understand the root of those things, and after years of being told I didn\u2019t care about her because I behaved in Y way, I just accepted it wasn\u2019t worth trying to do different. \n\nMy current gf is much better with this, and has actually taught me a lot about behaviors that are acceptable versus unacceptable. She\u2019s direct when I mess up, but doesn\u2019t explain it as \u201cyou don\u2019t care\u201d or like I act like I don\u2019t. She explains the reason why certain behaviors make her feel good, and others don\u2019t. It sucks im learning these in my 20s, but I can\u2019t change the fact that I didn\u2019t get it before. Do I execute them perfectly? No, but I try a lot harder when I\u2019m masking to do them.\n\nCommunication is always superior to expectation.", "Although I think a lot of NT people struggle with this, I find it hard to understand (ironically). Because when someone tells me what they want, what works for them, that is the easiest social cue to understand. I don\u2019t need to know why they like please or thank you, they just like it. \n\nFrom the outside looking in, some autistic people have this need to understand, and they won\u2019t do something unless they get a \u2018logical\u2019 explanation, and it has to fit certain lines of reasoning and has axioms and rejects others that aren\u2019t explained but I\u2019ve had to intuit from experience. And I don\u2019t get it. That kind of understanding is only a heuristic shortcut undercut by its own limited framework. It looks like (sorry) stubbornness, not cluelessness. This is seperate and distinct from something autistic people also struggle with, which is understanding unwritten or subtle social cues.", "But actually realistically NT people are the same. You learn to automatically remember to say please and thank you because your brain understands why you should be doing it in those situations. It's just that your brain fundamentally understands 'because people like it better' as a reason. \n\nSo you don't have to consciously remember to say please and thank you each time because your brain has created a circuit  - 'Z is a thing I do in X circumstances because y'. And your brain is able to assess circumstances as they come up and know if they fit X, to automatically do Z. \n\nWith some ND people the only difference is that 'because people like it' isn't an understandable reason on its own that lets you automatically know where are the situations you should do it. There's nothing about that that separates circumstances where you should do it from when you don't need to. \n\nSo it remains a conscious process of trying to figure out minute to minute if you should do it. Like imagine someone told you every time you talk about a topic where you think someone might be upset you have to touch your elbow to your knee. The only reason given was 'just because'. \n\nIt's exhausting, and distracting, and will never become automatic, and you will forget sometimes. You'll also get it wrong.\n\nIt's likely why OPs daughter talks about being uncomfortable. It's entirely possible she's used the words in the wrong situation or context before and is now extra anxious every time she tries to do it."]}
