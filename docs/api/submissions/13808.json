I sometimes get selectively mute, sometimes I get overwhelmed because saying thank you/please can feel too direct (akin to looking someone in the eye) and also obligatory/forced. I get overwhelmed COMPUTING just the perfect moment and while doing so believe I'm a failure for missing that beat. Simplest interactions can be DRAINING, like walking with bags of sand to interact with a cashier, while more complex have just enough information to get my brain rolling at high speed.\n\nI wish you never require people to accommodate your failing mind at old age.", "Absolutely YTA. For being an ASD parent you seem to have very little understanding of the condition.  Social interactions are difficult and stressful for many people with ASD.

Especially please, its hard to find the place and way to frame it/word it at times, not always obviously but there are times when it can feel awkward for sure n I get where the daughters coming from, personally I struggle with your welcomes more n usually respond yep or for sure kinda deal when I get thanked, and I've never been diagnosed with anything so I mean.. I dunno anyways YTA, tell her canned responses, go to phrases or reactions n whatnot can help with awkwardness, overthinking, all that noise if it helps", "Soft YTA. \n\nI always thought social awkwardness is part of aspergers, but as you're the parent of this child, I'm going to defer to you as the expert.\n\n1) Telling your child that she's rude as opposed to saying she's exhibiting rude behaviors is an AH move. You can critique & abhor a behavior without ridiculing the child.\n\n2) she's a teen. They're naturally rebellious.  Is it possible that you have a mini rebellion brewing or fully underway? It's a natural part of life. Just remind her of your expectations & let it go.\n\n3) as the parent it's your job to socialize her. But things such as please & thank you should've taken place at like 2-3 yrs old. So I wonder how is she with others? I constantly remind my child (8yrs old) to say please & thank you. But apparently he does it with EVERYONE  else, because I'm constantly told how delightful & polite he his & how great his manners are. I think its a \"love means never having to say you're sorry\" thing. Although for many its nice to hear the \"sorry\" from your love ones. You like hearing please & thank you. So unless she never does it with anyone,  i'd gently remind her AND make it appoint to say please & thank you when talking with her. \n\nBecause great manners go both ways & children learn by example.", "YTA.\n\nAlso autism has EVERYTHING to do with it! Autism often is the driving force when people don't understand social cues and niceties. What you consider \"basic manners\" doesn't always make sense to someone who doesn't fully understand social cues.\n\nYou have to TEACH someone who clearly isn't aware of social cues and social interaction that \"this is what we do.\" You make it a routine which btw helps autistic people because we feel some sort of control when we know x y z comes after a b c.\n\nYou had 17yrs to help her understand in her way of what social niceties, cues and expectations of social situations means and what you do in them.\n\nYou failed parenting her and now is wanting to blame her for your failings. She ain't at fault, you are. You had 17yrs to help her overcome difficulties that often plague autistic people. And you didn't.\n\nJust cause you failed doesn't mean she's the entire problem. She can learn she just needs help to be better at it. And I'd believe her that she does try to follow social norms it's just awkward for her.", "NAH.

Hello, I\u2019m someone with autism and asperges. I struggle with formalities and the pleases and thank yous. Not saying \u201cplease\u201d is not rude, it\u2019s just not overly polite. My entire way of speaking is very direct and to the point, I find these words to be a waste and pointless, they should just be implied. If I\u2019m asking for something in a respectful tone and not in a moody, entitled way, then that is still good enough, that is not rude. However, I do also use them in structured scenarios. For example, when I get my food from the kitchen, which happens every day at the same time, I thank my father for cooking it. This is a routine, something us autistic people rely on a lot of the time, and therefore I merge the action of taking food from the same place at the same time with saying \u201cthank you\u201d. So yes, I do think she has said pleases and thank yous before even if you didn\u2019t realise it.\n\nMy parents did raise me to be polite, but growing up I never grasped the idea of needing to use them because if everyone just expected super-politeness, then that\u2019s exhausting.

Calling them rude and putting them down isn\u2019t going to help anything, at this point you are going to need to \u201cmom\u201d up and start constant reminders and corrections this is on you as mom to teach them things, kids don\u2019t just magically pick up a book one day and read, for your child manners and polite social cues is just like reading they need to be taught, reinforced, and made habit.", "\u2026\u2026\u2026.YTA \n\nIt\u2019s your job in the early years to make \u201cplease\u201d and \u201cthank you\u201d come as naturally and automatically as breathing. \n\nIt is then your job to remind them when it slips.

Even if she has autism, you're right, she still needs to learn basic manners of please and thank you. Why you're the AH is for dismissing her and dismissing her autism. She has told you that she does say it, just not always because she feels uncomfortable. Did you ask why she's uncomfortable? How you can work to improve that? You told that she was rude and it was nothing to do with her autism. Do you know that? Do you know how autism works? It sounds like it very much is linked to that and to social awkwardness. But instead of working with her to improve it, you just insulted her and dismissed how her diagnosis impacts her life which is infuriating as a person with autism.", "YTA. Go to a coffee shop.

Now they are older they have begun to use phrases of gratitude much more easily!", "YTA. If you want to be a parent or teacher, you need to approach people, especially children, from a place of understanding. Calling your kid a bad person is kind of fucked up if you haven\u2019t already done everything in your power to teach them, and they aren\u2019t doing anything horrible. Approach topics like this by addressing the *behavior itself* as morally wrong, but first listen to what they have to say on struggles they\u2019re having, and *help them* figure out ways to overcome what\u2019s making it difficult for them. You need to be on their side, and calling them a bad person is not only far from taking their side, I might call it emotional abuse and neglecting of your duty as a parent. You might see some of these things as minor, but I promise you, bring a child and having the only person in the world you rely on and trust call you a bad person, is going to really hurt, and over prolonged periods can cause long lasting trauma that could affect them for the rest of their life without therapy.\n\nEdit: also, if you\u2019ve done this and you\u2019ve both genuinely made an effort and your child still is unable to do it, you have to take your child\u2019s side and consider that maybe their autism genuinely does affect their ability to do what you\u2019re asking of them.", "YTA. Because Autism absolutely does have something to do with it.\n\nI'm undiagnosed autistic, working on getting diagnosed. Things like \"please\" and \"thank you\" just don't come to me naturally.

At most if I know I'm asking for more than usual from my mom I'll send her a begging image. \n\nYes, my parents tried to teach that, but that just doesn't help some of us. Similarly, I don't ask people how their day was either because I literally do not think to and by the time I do the conversation had already moved on.\n\nI don't say \"I love you\" to anyone in my family, because saying it literally makes me want to cut my throat open. Some things genuinely feel too awkward or \"too much\" for us to say.

So the autism may well have interfered with A learning Ps & Qs as easily as her sister.  Imo 15 is not too late.
