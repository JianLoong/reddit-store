You can critique & abhor a behavior without ridiculing the child.\n\n2) she's a teen. They're naturally rebellious.  Is it possible that you have a mini rebellion brewing or fully underway? It's a natural part of life. Just remind her of your expectations & let it go.\n\n3) as the parent it's your job to socialize her. But things such as please & thank you should've taken place at like 2-3 yrs old. So I wonder how is she with others? I constantly remind my child (8yrs old) to say please & thank you. But apparently he does it with EVERYONE  else, because I'm constantly told how delightful & polite he his & how great his manners are. I think its a \"love means never having to say you're sorry\" thing. Although for many its nice to hear the \"sorry\" from your love ones. You like hearing please & thank you. So unless she never does it with anyone,  i'd gently remind her AND make it appoint to say please & thank you when talking with her. \n\nBecause great manners go both ways & children learn by example.", "YTA.\n\nAlso autism has EVERYTHING to do with it! Autism often is the driving force when people don't understand social cues and niceties. What you consider \"basic manners\" doesn't always make sense to someone who doesn't fully understand social cues.\n\nYou have to TEACH someone who clearly isn't aware of social cues and social interaction that \"this is what we do.\" You make it a routine which btw helps autistic people because we feel some sort of control when we know x y z comes after a b c.\n\nYou had 17yrs to help her understand in her way of what social niceties, cues and expectations of social situations means and what you do in them.\n\nYou failed parenting her and now is wanting to blame her for your failings.

Hello, I\u2019m someone with autism and asperges. I struggle with formalities and the pleases and thank yous. Not saying \u201cplease\u201d is not rude, it\u2019s just not overly polite. My entire way of speaking is very direct and to the point, I find these words to be a waste and pointless, they should just be implied. If I\u2019m asking for something in a respectful tone and not in a moody, entitled way, then that is still good enough, that is not rude. However, I do also use them in structured scenarios. For example, when I get my food from the kitchen, which happens every day at the same time, I thank my father for cooking it. This is a routine, something us autistic people rely on a lot of the time, and therefore I merge the action of taking food from the same place at the same time with saying \u201cthank you\u201d. So yes, I do think she has said pleases and thank yous before even if you didn\u2019t realise it.\n\nMy parents did raise me to be polite, but growing up I never grasped the idea of needing to use them because if everyone just expected super-politeness, then that\u2019s exhausting.

You told that she was rude and it was nothing to do with her autism. Do you know that? Do you know how autism works? It sounds like it very much is linked to that and to social awkwardness.

If you want to be a parent or teacher, you need to approach people, especially children, from a place of understanding. Calling your kid a bad person is kind of fucked up if you haven\u2019t already done everything in your power to teach them, and they aren\u2019t doing anything horrible. Approach topics like this by addressing the *behavior itself* as morally wrong, but first listen to what they have to say on struggles they\u2019re having, and *help them* figure out ways to overcome what\u2019s making it difficult for them. You need to be on their side, and calling them a bad person is not only far from taking their side, I might call it emotional abuse and neglecting of your duty as a parent. You might see some of these things as minor, but I promise you, bring a child and having the only person in the world you rely on and trust call you a bad person, is going to really hurt, and over prolonged periods can cause long lasting trauma that could affect them for the rest of their life without therapy.\n\nEdit: also, if you\u2019ve done this and you\u2019ve both genuinely made an effort and your child still is unable to do it, you have to take your child\u2019s side and consider that maybe their autism genuinely does affect their ability to do what you\u2019re asking of them.", "YTA.

I have been diagnosed with ADHD, not autism, but I am pretty sure that I am also somewhere on the spectrum, for a number of reasons.

It can just feel so awkward, so excruciating, so impossible to say what seems like something very simple and easy. But it's just--not. Sometimes it's fine and it is simple for me to do. Sometimes I can force myself to do it. Sometimes I can't. The weight of how excruciating it feels is just too much. And knowing that I should be able to say something, knowing that not being able to say it is making things awkward, just makes me more anxious and uncomfortable and makes the whole thing worse. \n\nI don't think you are correct that it's not tied to her autism. If she could easily do what you are asking, she would. She clearly cares about being rude or she wouldn't have been upset by what you said. So there's obviously a reason that she doesn't always do it, and she told you: she feels awkward and uncomfortable. It seems like this very well could be, and probably is, related to her autism. She will need to work on it, because you are right that it could lead to her being perceived as rude and cause problems for her. But you insulting her and telling her it has nothing to do with her autism when you have no basis for thinking that's the case except your assumptions is not helpful. Adding more guilt and shame around those interactions could easily make it even harder for her to do these things.", "YTA. Many studies show people with autism don\u2019t communicate like other folks. And say thank you very differently. Gave my neighbour some garlic and ended up getting pics of one dish she made and 2 bowls of the garlic soup she made. Have also given her other things and she texts every time she uses it. It\u2019s a way to say thank you. Speaking can also be really hard with autism. In many situations. I have friends who use flash cards to communicate with servers as it\u2019s a high pressure situation for them.", "NTA - its funny how this sub will swing wildly between \u201cyou\u2019re an AH if you expect an autistic person to do anything normal in society\u201d to \u201cautism isnt an excuse to be a rude person\u201d. \n\nSounds like pretty darn close to normal teen stuff. People acting like 15 is too late to parent or that 15 year olds turn out perfect if OP had done everything else right are also off their rocker\u2026 or teens themselves.", "NTA- The People Who Say YTA Are Hypocrites", "NTA- \n\nYou told her her manners are important and she needs to use them.\n\nYou said her autism isn't an excuse .\n\nYou said you've taught your kids manners.\n\nI believe all of this. I'm a mam and sir person. I have taught my children this since birth. \n\nAt 13,14,15, my oldest refused. Now she has a job and uses them daily and often. \n\nRemember when they would seemingly forget stuff as they learned new stuff as toddlers? Then they are five and able to do it all again.\n\nI think this is what's happening.. relax. It will happen. \n\nAnd it's a parents job to tell the kid when they are messing up. She is messing up. Being autistic is no excuse for rudeness when they can and don't want to.  Life is awkward and gross at best.\n\nMaybe have her embrace the awkwardness.", "NTA. This sounds like a teenager doing what teenagers do - testing boundaries to find out where they are. This will be further complicated by her diagnoses and how they impact those boundaries (compared to her sister, for example).\n\nI think you might need to recontextualise this for her though. First of all stop doing \"a lot\" for her (i.e. anything for her) unless she says please first. Secondly, impress on her how much harder life will be for her without manners. It will be more difficult to make friends and allies, to get and keep jobs, and even to get served in a polite and timely fashion in her daily life. \n\nAs long as she is using manners at home and understands the consequences of not using them out of the home; well she is getting to the age where she needs to learn the consequences for herself...", "YTA for the comment\n\n\"But I've barely heard it, and I've done a lot for her.\"\n\nyou aren't upset that she doesn't use them, you are upset that you don't feel appreciated.\n\nThat is how you approach your child. You can allow them to know how a thank you can make you feel.\n\nYour daughter may feel indifferent to please and thank you when others are requesting and getting things from her. That may have to do with her autism.\n\nand if it was just the statement it would be one thing, but you called her a rude person thus not making this about the please and thank but about her personally.\n\nthen add in your comments and it seals the vote for me. you are legally obligated to provide for your children, but you can also force them to learn to cook, clean and care for themselves so it's not all on you. but the comment at how you would be kicked out and that you are too soft is highly concerning.\n\ni don't always tell my mom thank you because she knows i'm grateful for her and she personally doesn't need to hear it all the time. But there are folks who do need to hear it to be reminded what they do matters.", "YTA. And you sound like a petulant child. I grew up as an undiagnosed autistic person in the 1960s, and my parents were more understanding than you are.  Your relationship with your daughter is transactional at best, and cruel.\n\n\"One thing I have noticed is that she doesn't say \"please\" or \"thank you\" on occasion.\"\n\nSo you watch her like a hawk and nitpick her behavior because you're ashamed and embarrassed to have a defective child who, on occasion, doesn't follow all social cues.  The people who know your family aren't critical of you for having a defective kid. They look down on you for being a defective parent. \n\nLet me tell you the only thing your daughter is sure of. She is not good enough. And never will be.  She knows this because you've told her this for her  entire life. Every step she's taken, she's had you to correct her, to tell her to do it \"right\" or nobody will like her.\n\nAnd it's not just your words. That annoyed and dismissive look you give that tells her she messed up again is worse.\n\nAnd do you know what her crime always is?  She was just being herself in the moment.  Every autistuc kid knows how dangerous that is. Being yourself in the moment can get you hurt. So you're teaching her to never be herself. This is devastating. \n\nGet off her back and stop with your constant casual cruelty.\n\nETA: And who doesn't forget social niceties \"on occasion\".  But OP doesn't monitor anyone else, especially herself.", "YTA!!! It does actually have to do with Autism. My sister is autistic and strugglers with these neurotypical social interactions all the time. It sounds like you need to educate yourself. Go see a therapist that specializes in autism or if you can\u2019t watch some YouTube videos, read a book, and seek out adults who have autism and get advice and mentoring from them.", "YTA. There are polite ways to word a request without actually saying the word please. We teach \"please\" to little kids because it's easier to have a simple rule. But real conversation is more complex than that.\n\nIf someone says \"May I have the steak, medium rare?\" or \"I appreciate it\" or \"No problem!\", they are not rude just because they didn't verbatim say please, thank you, and you're welcome. It sounds like she just has kind of a block about those specific words.", "My daughter is neurotypical, she is however fairly introverted and isn't comfortable speaking to people that she isn't completely familiar with. I taught her basic sign language as an infant to ease the frustration of not being able to fully communicate her wants and needs, so now when she feels unable to actually SPEAK to someone to thank them, she signs thank you, as a way to be polite, acknowledge and respond without causing her emotional distress....perhaps this would work for you? I'm new here and not sure what all the abbreviations stand for, but you could research and be willing to offer alternatives and work with your child to help them, imo\n\nEdit: I am a special needs paraeducator and work with neuro-divergent children on a daily basis, sometimes you just need to tweak things, the same thing doesn't work for everyone...square pegs don't fit in round holes \ud83d\ude01", "I\u2019ve got two with PDA so I feel you . And I agree with how it\u2019s gone with age too", "\u201cUncomfortable\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s some bullshit indeed. Only the polite words are painful?", "Well damn. I'm in my 50s and never diagnosed with anything and you just described me. Saying things like bless you when someone sneezes is like fingernails on a chalkboard.", "Thank you for writing everything I wanted to say \ud83d\ude0a", "This part made me frown so badly . She\u2019s her kid she\u2019s SUPPOSED to do \u2018a lot\u2019 for her .. sigh", "I\u2019m autistic, I\u2019m the same and I\u2019m 28. I\u2019ve grown now and I\u2019m still uncomfortable with it to the extent that I don\u2019t ask anyone for anything, I\u2019m even uncomfortable hearing it.", "I struggled with this a lot, and now I\u2019m like you. I think all the daughter needs is understanding and patience, it\u2019s what helped me", "I think so, yes", "Same in the UK I can\u2019t imagine not using basic manners in your daily life, everyone does here", "Does OP say they're from Canada? (Or in another place where 'please' and 'thank you' are said *everywhere*?) At the very least, testing it will set OP's expectations.", "She says she does says please and thanks sometimes so autism is a total block.", "But not everyone is going to recognize that she's autistic. This line of logic is why a lot of men with autism are creepy with women. Nobody bothered to teach them how to behave because of their disability so now they have no self discipline around women they find attractive or interesting. Do you know what that leads to? It leads to female shopkeepers hiding in the back while their male colleague takes over because they are uncomfortable, or girls trying to switch classes and schedules to get away from them. \n\nNot teaching this girl manners isn't doing her any favors, it's setting her up for failure later down the line.", "Then make that effort. For god's sake I make an effort to turn my blinker on every time I turn. It's not impossible to remember to thank people and be polite.", "Exactly. There's a reason why Americans have a stereotype of being rude and demanding. The first time I went to the states and heard someone address a clerk by saying \"gimme\" rather than using please, my jaw nearly hit the floor.", "No, autistic people can do things sometimes and not do them at other times.\n\nIt sounds a bit like these phrases are part of the daughters masking (and by that I mean the behavior that is hard for her bc of autism, but she does anyway, because sociey has expectations of normalcy. Masking is when an autistic person goes against their nature in order to blend in).\n\nWhile it's not necessarily hard to just say 'please' and 'thank you', there are so many little things like that that adds up. And the total tally of that is hard work, done all the time, constantly, for the comfort of others. OP needs to look into autism and have a chat with her daughter about this, because this probably isn't about being rude or not, not by a long shot. Autistic burnout is a real risk and OP doesn't sound like she's even considering that as a potential cause.", "I feel like maybe the problem is more that you feel unappreciated, not that she's rude to everyone in general. \n\nIt's a valid feeling, but I think I'd got about addressing it more directly.", "This is all very reasonable. However, maybe there are ways to figure out what it is that she finds awkward and uncomfortable in those situations. Maybe bringing out the thought process of how awkward and uncomfortable situations can actually be without saying it? Remember that even autism aside, teenagers are at a stage in brain development that their empathetic response is toned down, and there's a lot of things teenagers are needlessly bratty about, but they can't control it. I remember it when I was a teen, and I'm an adult who is a lot more grateful than I was as a teen. Ultimately, you will not get anywhere with anger, and the only way forward is through some kind of conversation that can help things click a bit better. I'm not sure if she has a therapist, but that's something maybe the therapist can help you plan a conversation and strategy", "Ik, so its the person\u2019s job to point their autism out if someone questions their abnormality (I have to a lot, for literally everything). \nAlso youre comparing creepy behaviour to pointless manners that serve to fill one\u2019s ego. Get a grip on reality.", "Being polite is a pointless exercise to full one\u2019s ego. not being impolite is not being rude, people need to understand this: they\u2019re not worth it. They don\u2019t do anything. People not using them only hurt someone because people have the high expectations of praise and gratitude which is ridiculous.\n\nBut also making an effort is hard when there are much bigger problems and priorities in life than not saying please and thank you.", "Ahhh that\u2019s insane! When I worked in a bar we literally refused to serve people if they demanded instead of asking, even when drunk you can ask politely or you can stay thirsty", "I always, always thank anyone who feeds me or cooks for me. Even mom. Actually especially mom.", ">\tI wouldn\u2019t say thank you every time my parent makes dinner.\n\nThat\u2019s wild to me. Saying thank you is just so low effort that there\u2019s no reason to place a high bar for what deserves it. Yeah, parents are obligated to provide food (and I can think of endless other things people would be assholes for not doing), but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not appreciated?", "Just because something is someone's obligation doesn't mean it doesn't deserve appreciation. It's my boss's job (which she is PAID FOR) to provide me with assistance/guidance. I still thank her.", ">Admittedly, I wouldn't say thank you every time my parent makes dinner. Mainly because it is an obligation of the parent to provide food to their child. \n \n\nSure it's an obligation, but try just saying \"thank you for dinner mom (or dad)\" as you're getting up after every meal.   It'll go a long way", "It's not pointless at all and maybe you need to spend some time in a kindergarten classroom of you think like that", "Ah, you just want to argue for the sake of arguing.", "Right? There's a joke among those of us who work in my town. You can tell whose American and whose not by how they treat the service staff. Plus, rude people usually become a joke once they leave. Manners are important", "Every time my wife cooks a meal, I loudly thank her in front of the children and they always pipe in as well. They do it on their own first many times. And when I cook they do the same thing for me. It's basic kindness.", "Yes, I'm not getting most of the comments here. I mean, yes it's an obligation, but they've still done a good thing for you. And saying \"thank you\" is such a small thing. Plus, in the rest of the world, isn't it just going to make life easier for someone who is kind and thankful? Strangers you meet aren't going to think, \"Well maybe she has a good reason for not thanking me.\" They might just think someone's rude. I don't know. I think the OP is right to want her kid to say thank you.", "Spot on. I cooked for my parents for years and the fact my father very rarely even acknowledged it was incredibly demotivating, I found myself thinking I'll just put no effort in because then I won't be hurt when he just ignores it.\n\nAt least it taught me to always be thankful when someone cooks for me."]}
