He's always been heavy. When we started dating he weighted about 250 lbs, wanting to get down to 200. Now he is over 400lbs. There are a lot of things that contributed to that, but that's another story.\n\nWe recently set a goal for visiting all US states, and maybe evening doing some more international travel. I would love to visit Iceland, Europe, cruise the Caribbean and hike in Alaska. I actually hike through Colorado every few years. It would be amazing to visit all my favorite parks and do some beginner trails with him!\n\nWe went to Washington DC in 2018 and it was rough. He was able to do some of the touristy things but needed to uber between each one and our hotel. Same thing when we went to Chicago - we were .75 miles away from our hotel and with peak traffic an uber was like $25 but he hit his walking limit. When we went on our honeymoon cruise we hardly left the boat - a lot of activities had a limit of 275lbs.\n\nEven last time we flew, he couldn't fit in the seat and had to \"fake\" wearing his seatbelt by tucking it into his stomach. I don't want to risk lossing a flight. If we are spending money, like thousands to go to Alaska I want to be able to see Alaska.\n\nThe topic of booking a trip came up and I was upfront that WE need to lose weight and get in better shape first. I bought an elliptical, weights and we have a bike. I have talked about getting a gym membership but he's not interested. I refuse to book any \"big\" vacations until we are both physically ready for the adventure. For him -that's -losing about 100 lbs to fit on the plane. He didn't take this super well.\n\nAITA?

I hope your husband sees reason and makes the effort to get  healthy enough to travel.", "NTA.  However, I don't think anyone loses significant amounts of weight due to an ultimatum.

You speak so well of him that I believe you said it kindly, and it was always going to be a tough conversation. I think it's more that you were delivering bad news.\n\nYour considerations are all very practical. You can't enjoy vacations *to your fullest* as things are.\n\nThere are other trips you can take that work towards that goal. You can go places with hiking trails that are appropriate to his current ability level, or at least by a beach with a nice boulevard to walk down. That sort of thing can be more local and affordable than Alaska or cruises.\n\nRegarding the flight, if you ask the flight attendant they have seatbelt extenders. That doesn't solve any matters of seat size, but it puts you in compliance with the rules.", "NTA - Hard truths are tough to hear but it doesn\u2019t make you the asshole for stating what the reality is.", "NTA - I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a lot of things that contribute to the weight and most likely something he feels guilty about. \nThe journey isn\u2019t a simple one, he\u2019s going to have to restructure a lot things in order to make it possible. You can\u2019t force that though. You\u2019re in a rock and hard place", "NTA- but phrasing is important, haha.

Not to mention I\u2019m sure you would like him around for the long term.", "NTA \n\nYou obviously care about him. Sometimes the truth is hard to hear. \n\nIt doesn't make sense to spend lots of money on a vacation if he can't do anything besides the sedentary activities. If his mobility is that impaired and his size prevents you guys from enjoying yourselves, there isn't much sense in going anywhere. \n\nThe problem is that he has no intention of losing weight.

Edit: NTA!!", "NTA.\n\nVacations require planning and some of that planning is being physically ready for the trip. I was an overweight kid and held back my family by being slow and unprepared (one summer trip taught me how bad it can be to have your thighs rub together all day). \n\nWhen we took our kids to Disney we had them on daily hour long walks to get used to it because that's all you do. Walk and stand in line. \n\nIt's a harsh slap from reality, but sometimes you can't do what you want because of limitations you have.", "I'm an obese lady and I love traveling. I weighed just under 300lbs when I took a year off to backpack travel. That being said, I can also walk all day, every day for 15-20 km. I understand completely how hard missing bungee jumping and awkwardly fitting into airline seats can be... but I keep myself active because I love to travel. For me, knee pain after hiking up litteral dessert sand dunes is an unfortunate side affect of my weight. Losing weight is incredibly difficult though. I travel solo because I refuse to hold my life while waiting for others to get themselves together. Consider going solo if he's not willing to even try. My best memories begin by picking a direction and walking for hours just to see a random neighborhood in a random city. Life ticks on by way to quickly and everyone deteriorates. Sometimes people grow in different directions and want different things in life. It sounds like you're likely at an impass and you need to consider going it alone or with a different travel buddy or forever compromising on your dreams. I can't make this decision for you but I'll give you some advice. Make the decisions today that you're 85 year old self will look back on  and be happy she made them. I made memories. What will you make?", "Losing weight is about diet. Exercise is about fitness. Focus on diet first.", "NTA, but start with diet. You can\u2019t put run a bad diet.

I'm currently averaging 280lbs. But I'm also down 12 inches at the waist. He can do it IF he wants to BUT it's a combination of both exercise AND diet. Both play into it. As he loses weight, pain will start cropping up when there was none because the weight is coming OFF of the joints and the pressure is being released.", "NTA- Maybe working towards a goal might help. Hire a trainer to help you both get more fit.  Make sure he sees a doctor and see what they suggest to help with weight loss.\n\nYes, he is going to feel hungry at some point and yes that will suck. But he needs to be the adult here and not give in to that. Only eat the portion given to him.  Once a week he and you can have a small treat.", "Obesity is an illness. Tell your husband to get Ozempic (or any of the other semaglutide medications) prescribed. Best of luck!", "INFO: what is his reaction to you wanting to do things on your own? Like, you're on a cruise and you go do things you want to do while he does things he wants to do? \n\nIf he's fine with you doing activities on your own, then you're the asshole (although it is NOT OK for him to fake the seat belt, and that is a safety issue which he NEEDS to address because he is putting other people in danger by not following safety rules).

A better angle to approach this than an ultimatum refusing to travel would be to look at it from a health perspective. As a big guy, he might not want to go to the gym so the membership isn't appealing. Start with walking. And equally put as much effort into your eating habits. Talk to a dietician. And keep the focus on weight loss as a means to have longer life and more energy.", "Losing that much weight is a statistical improbability (feel free to google success rates, I\u2019ve heard a lot about how few people succeed at permanent weight loss through podcasts\u2026 and while you\u2019re at it, seatbelt extenders are a thing).  I think it would benefit you to think of his weight not as a failing of his, but rather a chronic health condition that he lives with.  If he had diabetes or a heart condition or was in a wheelchair, would you put conditions on him or would you try to book vacations that are accessible to him?\n\nI\u2019m sure that with research, you can figure out an accessible vacation that works for both of you. YTA if you stick with this mentality.", "YTA,\n\nYou're trying to motivate him by punishing him for his weight. \n\nAttend to whatever issue prevented him from losing weight and then put on such a drastic amount. Not make him feel like shit by telling him he can't go on holiday until he meets your weight standard.\n\nIf you want to do adventure holidays you should have just broached it as you'll be able to do more if you're both healthier and fitter, not these holidays aren't even an option because you're fat.", "YTA I understand why he needs to lose weight but your approach will only hurt the relationship and highly doubt is the kind of support your SO needs to overcome this problem.", "YTA\n\nFor one thing you can't actually tell him he can't take a vacation - you can decline to go with him, but that's about it.
