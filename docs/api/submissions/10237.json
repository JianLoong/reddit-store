When we went on our honeymoon cruise we hardly left the boat - a lot of activities had a limit of 275lbs.\n\nEven last time we flew, he couldn't fit in the seat and had to \"fake\" wearing his seatbelt by tucking it into his stomach. I don't want to risk lossing a flight.

Please keep in mind that I say all of these things as an overweight cancer survivor, so I can relate to your husband's experience. \n\nThis guy's body has been through A LOT.

Even if he reaches the goal weight, his stamina and physical capabilities may be very different than they were before treatment. Plenty of slim people in my cancer support group mention having lower energy and stamina after cancer. So you might have a new normal to accept. If he's never going to be up for big hikes in Alaska, would you never vacation with him? Are vacations only worthwhile if he can tackle these big activities? Or can you compromise?

He knows you mean him. And if you aren't directly addressing that issue, what else aren't you directly addressing? Does he know about this goal of him losing 100 pounds, or is that something you haven't discussed?

I am finally slowly recovering and also understand how absolutely daunting it can be to know how hard it\u2019s going to be to get that back. I agree with others\u2019 suggestions of smaller trips. You could even use those as rewards! (Ex. 10 lbs= a day trip) I\u2019m finally able to travel about an hour and spend 1/2 day doing short activities, so we plan things that we know I can do successfully so that I don\u2019t get disheartened or feel like I\u2019ve let my husband down.", "My god, maybe stop focusing so much on a VACATION and more on how your husband is doing after surviving all that.

Last time I had to have it in the hospital, we joked that every morning was \u2018wake up go to sleep\u2019 bc I\u2019d be woken up, eat breakfast, have my pre treatment Benadryl and Tylenol, and then slump over asleep half an hour into treatment. I felt like I wasn\u2019t maybe fully awake again until midafternoon. \n\nThe fact that a dialysis patient would lose his ability to go any further 3/4 miles from the hotel totally tracks. I used to take a friend of mine with severe kidney failures basically door to door. Unfortunately, she passed due to COVID complications (she contracted it before her second shot\u2014still gotta keep going into a dialysis center despite pandemic). \n\nI know you want him to be healthier and more mobile and hopefully live a long life and do fun things with you\u2014but his medical condition is very serious. You\u2019re not an asshole for not booking trips he can\u2019t reasonably do bc of his physical condition. You won\u2019t be hiking in Alaska with him maybe ever. But taking out anything that requires flights doesn\u2019t seem fair to him if he thinks he can do it. You can book two seats for him, or make sure he\u2019s next to you and on an aisle or window so he\u2019s not interfering with other\u2019s space.

Do not push him to lose weight quickly. A sustainable pace is no more than a pound a week, so it would take him 3 years or so to get to where you met if he steadily lost weight at that pace, and 2 years to get to where you want to be to book flights (which is why I think it\u2019s unfair).

And once you go on the first trip alone, you may find he changes his tune very quickly and starts a journey to health.", "I am obese, like your husband (a lot of things got me to this point), and it is beyond daunting to think about needing to lose all that weight, so I try not to think about the number at all. I'm single, and I LOVE to travel, and I didn't want to have to give that up. I've learned a lot of ways to get where I want to go and enjoy myself. One thing that has helped me a lot over the past year was purchasing an upright rollator walker (OasisSpace has a bariatric one that supports up to 450 lbs). At first, I was embarrassed to use it, but I live in Manhattan, so it's often much faster to get somewhere by walking, even if I'm slow. Instead of taking a hit to my self-esteem, it has helped me build my confidence! Now I'm able to walk to work, and I don't have to refuse every social engagement because I have trouble standing for any length of time. I'm moving so much more than I was a year ago. I'm building strength and stamina, and I'm much happier! Being more active and the increased social activity has almost completely put my chronic depression in remission. It makes travel infinitely easier. As it turns out, no one gives a fuck about whether someone needs a walking aid, and instead of the condescending looks I was expecting, I get kindness and support. It's a difficult journey, and it's taking forever for the numbers to go down on the scale, but my doctor reminded me that the number is not a direct reflection of my health. My body IS moving better than it used to, and my blood test results have improved, including my A1C. I'm just suggesting it because it has helped me to get back to traveling, which I really really love. Also, Southwest Airlines has an amazing person-of-size policy where you can request an extra seat for free when you check in. They say that they will honor the request whether the flight is full or not, but to avoid the possibility of getting bumped to a later flight, I buy the extra seat in advance (it's easier to call to do it than book it online), and then I just email them requesting a refund after the trip is completed. It rarely takes more than a few days for the refund to process. I've utilized this policy at least 30 times, and it has never been an issue. They will also provide wheel chair service to the gate if I'm having a rough leg day. I hope these suggestions are helpful. Most importantly, I hope you will encourage him to utilize resources so that you CAN travel together instead of waiting until he loses x number of pounds.", "NTA.

It\u2019s perfectly reasonable to not want to spend money traveling if you feel like you\u2019re not getting everything out of it you want to.

Also all airlines have seatbelt extenders on hand, you just have to ask the flight attendant so no need to hide an unbuckled belt next time! So if you fly with them and your husband just focuses more on his endurance and less on the number on the scale, you may not have to give him as daunting a weight loss goal. 100 lbs is a big number to hit someone with and with his current habits, is probably very overwhelming.", "INFO: How exactly did you tell him this concern of yours?

But if you actually want to get that vacation in the future, you need to let HIM decide if he wants to lose the weight, and support him through the process of going through all the change that goes along with it.

Something like EDMR in the hands of a specialist trauma counsellor will make a huge amount of difference to his state of mind, and emotional stability and happiness. \n\nWhat should naturally follow is a more compassionate and forgiving attitude towards his body and its limitations, and a desire to look after it and support it in healing. \n\nI would suggest that going straight for the old \u201cdiet and exercise\u201d will have limited use, as it will probably feel like punishment to him, and he\u2019s already feeling punished enough. \n\nAnother thing that might help is gentle bodywork like massage. When you go through a medical crisis, your body gets treated like a recalcitrant lump of meat. You get poked and prodded, tubes get put in you, doctors hurt you and ignore your pain, you get shoved and pulled around. Its horrible. \n\nAgain, a gentle, restorative massage treatment series, carried out with compassion, might be enormously helpful to him. If money is tight, this is something you can learn to do yourself, from Youtube. You\u2019re not looking for vigorous sport or triggerpoint massage. You\u2019re looking for restorative massage, or Swedish massage - long, gentle, sweeping stokes. Be aware he may become distressed, and you can stop or slow down, or work with his trauma therapist to overcome this distress. \n\nIn the same vein, there\u2019s a lovely branch of Yoga called \u201cRestorative Yoga\u201d which is basically being propped up with bolsters and blocks and covered in a blanket and doing breathing and meditation exercises. Its enormously soothing and relaxing and, well, restorative. \n\nFor gentle exercise to restore trust in, and a connection with his body, something like Yoga with Adrienne on Youtube is very beginner friendly and can be done in private, at home, when its convenient. He can also stop and start as he needs to.  \n\nYou\u2019ve had a lot of people giving good diet and exercise advice here, so I thought it might be helpful to take it back a couple of notches and see if I could give some helpful advice on what might be underpinning his weight gain, and how to deal with that directly. \n\nI hope that this is useful to you, and that he is able to heal,  and enjoy hiking and exploring with you in the amazing Alaskan wilderness.", "I was going to suggest she go on a few trips by herself.

But it\u2019s been almost 2 months now that I\u2019ve left the hospital and I\u2019ve kept it off and have lost a bit more. \n\nExcercise is important but you cannot force someone to do it. I was forced before growing up and it just didn\u2019t stick. However maybe there are some other things you can do. Diet can impact as well.  Ot sucks because I love food, but like I said it was Hell for me in the hospital so that keeps me in check.

Good luck!", "NTA- Used to work for a company who amongst other things did the mobility assistance at airports. My job was to deal with the injury claims. A lot of the mobility assistance related accidents were because people lied about their weight or size and did things like fake having a seatbelt securely fastened. Then they tried to sue us because they had the exact accident the weight/size limit was designed to prevent. Or worse, someone else got injured because they weren't strapped in. My sympathy is with the person whose neck gets broken when a vehicle stops short and he's thrown on top of them. If he doesn't want to put the effort in to get back down to 'safe to travel', he cannot go and risk other people's health and lives. The fact that he's ruining your holidays and wasting your money is secondary.", "NTA. It would be so damaging to your relationship to go on one of your dream trips and then have him unable to participate - which would be no fun for you either.", "NTA", "Next time you fly, he can ask the airline attendant for a seatbelt extender; it will allow you to buckle the belt.\n\nMy husband and I sometimes go on trips that galena lot of walking - usually Disney World. For a few months up to the trip we'll go on long walks, and work up to walking 20k steps per day. Maybe you could do something similar?", "Nta. I love the progress pics on r/intermittent fasting. It's really inspiring.", "NTA, but take it from someone who has lost a lot of weight at various points in their life, you can work out all you want...losing weight happens in the kitchen.\n\nCount calories, reuse meals to cut down on the counting aspect.  No snacking, no booze.  Water, lean protein, lentils, and vegetables.   It is VERY straight forward...it just takes discipline.", "Look, I know people really get tight about not telling your partner to lose weight and body shaming, but there is nothing wrong with recommending a healthier lifestyle. At this level of weight, of course that's a health hazard. You'd be completely daft to disagree. NTA keep trying OP", "They can give you seatbelt extenders on the plane. In the event of a crash your 400lb husband becomes a projectile. \n\nNTA, btw.", "YTA. Hiding his diseases is deceptive and if the Gender was reversed, this sub would tear you a new one", "NTA- weight loss is hard I have lost 45 pounds in the last 6 months and I also understand to keep it off I am going to have to treat foods I like as treats as they clearly don\u2019t work for me. But this weight loss was a now or never moment for me so I decided to make it now.", "NTA\n\nBeing that heavy is not ok for several reasons. He should understand that he's limiting other people by weighing so much and try to get into better shape. Also, the health issues that will surely come his way in the future will not be only his health issues, but they will become your health issues too. Bills don't pay themselves.", "nta maybe try keto", "Nutritionist and public health researcher here. NAH. Going on these trips won't be fun for either of you. \n\nHere's my advice: stop trying to link his weight and the trips. Weight gain and loss can be motivated this way, but if it isn't working, it isn't working. And if you continue, it's going to do the opposite. He'll be demotivated, and likely put on more weight.\n\nYour husband needs to work out what's at the root of it. It's going to be a combination of things (working from home does not make you overeat, it could be the isolation involved etc). In addition, another block may be his health battle. I've been through my own, and something I unconsciously did was start hating and distrusting my body. It had become (in my head) my jailer, so I treated it badly. \n\nEncourage your partner to get therapy aimed at those with chronic health issues. He needs to connect with his body in the same way you do. Encouraging walking is great, but exercise doesn't really help you lose weight. Weight is lost or gained in the kitchen, essentially. \n\nMy last piece of advice I cannot emphasise enough: Dont police what he eats. Encourage discussions where there is ZERO judgement. And if he's uncomfortable? Stop. Let him know that he can come to you and talk to you openly, honestly. \n\nAt the end of the day, you can't do this for him. You can help him, support him and be there for him, but you can't do it for him. \n\nGood luck!", "YTA. Weight loss is not easy for a lot of people and furthermore the larger one gets the less likely a doctor is to look for underlying diseases that may cause weight gain or the inability to lose weight. Cancer and multiple surgeries take different recovery times for every body type, and more than likely with that much weight gain there are some serious underlying conditions that have not been diagnosed properly. He probably already feels bad enough and the way society treats fat people likely contributes to his unwillingness to leave the house frequently or go to a gym, where you will be surrounded by healthy people who will either judge you or gawk at you with applause etc while you just want to remain invisible. \n\nSupport your husband with love not punishment and accept him for who he is.", "If my partner told me I was too big for a trip and needed to lose weight, I'd be really hurt. I am sure there are plenty of things for you to do that didn't require you to body shame your husband YTA", "YTA \n\nYou knew who you were marrying. You knew. \n\nNow he has become more of who he is and you are shaming him. \n\nHe is an adult. He is making his own choices. Are they healthy and pro -social? Is it impacting\nthe people he loves? Is it causing undue stress in his relationships? Regardless of the answers- All of that is on him. \n\nYou cannot control this adult man anymore then you can control the life choices of your local barista. Is it fair? No. Should your husband care about how his choices impact you- yes. And he doesn\u2019t seem to care. Not enough to change. And you cannot change that. \n\nRead Betty Martin\u2019s book \u201cThe Art of Giving and Receiving\u201d once you truly understand what you have control over ( which is not another adult human) then you can decide how you want this to play out.", "I am going to get downvoted for this but... YTA\n\nI read some of her comments. The husband has cancer and is on dialysis. Traveling to the US would the dumbest thing ever with him while he's on dialysis. She is selfish and only doing this for herself, cause she doesn't want to be with a fat guy. I have cancer my self and one of the side effects of my cancer meds is weight gain.", "Where did she mention this pls ?", "christ how could she not mention this in the original post. like holy shit!!", "It won't, but at least for me when i have needed to lose weight after letting myself go a couple times getting started with the working out and getting active again can lead to the reduction in unproductive calories. Your body starts to crave those nutrients it isnt getting burning the fat, and I find myself reaching for water when i am super thirsty during/after a work out. Also, even while packing the extra weight if you start building a foundation of muscle under the fat you can start doing the fun activities that will remind your brain of all the things you can do again once you loose the weight :)", "A person who is 400 lbs can also get weight loss surgery to help with the process", "> My best memories begin by picking a direction and walking for hours just to see a random neighborhood in a random city.\n\nThis is my favorite thing to do!!!

Unfortunately, her grandma died the week before our trip and she had to go home for her funeral, so she couldn't make it. I had to decide whether to go myself or to try and get partial refunds for everything. I decided to go alone. It was my first ever solo trip and you know what? I had fun! I didn't have to follow anyone's schedule or make accommodations for someone else. I just did and ate whatever I felt like, went to bed and got up whenever, and it was pretty damn liberating.", "I once lost 60 pounds in 8 weeks one summer...I was a 5'9, 220 pound male, age 24, drinking 6 days a week and eating whatever I wanted and then I changed all that.\n\nCut back to 12 beers allowed per week (I'd do 6 on one day and 6 on another); I ate 1 egg + egg whites, with salsa, greek yogurt, and black beans for breakfast daily.  I'd eat grilled chicken and vegetables + Frank's hot sauce for lunch and dinner.  My cheat meal was Sunday I'd eat an entire Domino's pizza by myself over the course of the day.

But he's also the master of his destiny, and the reality is that he doesn't want to put the work in.

They can set you up with appointments in the city you are going to it just takes some logistical planning and working with your current clinic.  I've had patients that have done it.

It might be difficult, but not impossible.", "I too have POTS- it's not so much the walking with that (in fact it helps keep my blood flowing, we're like sharks lol), it's the queues! I wonder if the message about POTS and other 'walked up looking fine, not going to be able to walk tomorrow if I stand here ten minutes' conditions, so some kind of provision is made for queuing where we can sit the queue out without jumping the queue.

It can make things difficult, but not impossible.  The exchanges without a cycler can take 30 minutes or less depending on the patient. I've worked with patients who have done this.
