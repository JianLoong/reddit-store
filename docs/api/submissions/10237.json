When we went on our honeymoon cruise we hardly left the boat - a lot of activities had a limit of 275lbs.\n\nEven last time we flew, he couldn't fit in the seat and had to \"fake\" wearing his seatbelt by tucking it into his stomach.

Please keep in mind that I say all of these things as an overweight cancer survivor, so I can relate to your husband's experience. \n\nThis guy's body has been through A LOT. It may be more difficult for him to lose weight after cancer treatment. Even if he reaches the goal weight, his stamina and physical capabilities may be very different than they were before treatment. Plenty of slim people in my cancer support group mention having lower energy and stamina after cancer. So you might have a new normal to accept. If he's never going to be up for big hikes in Alaska, would you never vacation with him? Are vacations only worthwhile if he can tackle these big activities? Or can you compromise?

He knows you mean him. And if you aren't directly addressing that issue, what else aren't you directly addressing? Does he know about this goal of him losing 100 pounds, or is that something you haven't discussed? Did you discuss buying fitness equipment with him, or did you passive aggressively surprise him with it?

I also get that he\u2019s had various medical issues and lifestyle changes that\u2019s contributed. I myself gained ~100 lb in the last 12 years due to my own medical problems and drastic lifestyle changes because of them (I slowly went from jogging/weight training/yoga 4-5 days a week to not being able to stand long enough to take a shower). I am finally slowly recovering and also understand how absolutely daunting it can be to know how hard it\u2019s going to be to get that back. I agree with others\u2019 suggestions of smaller trips. You could even use those as rewards! (Ex. 10 lbs= a day trip) I\u2019m finally able to travel about an hour and spend 1/2 day doing short activities, so we plan things that we know I can do successfully so that I don\u2019t get disheartened or feel like I\u2019ve let my husband down.", "My god, maybe stop focusing so much on a VACATION and more on how your husband is doing after surviving all that. Plus, the world is not kind to overweight people - he needs your support, not your judgment. You don't think he feels like shit about weighing 400 pounds? He survived cancer, he should be celebrating his body for getting him through that. Support him but don't push, there's no evidence it helps anyone lose weight anyhow.", "I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s hard to watch someone you care about struggle with a health condition, and one of the worst parts of obesity is the tantalizing suggestion that it\u2019s possible to change it through will power and just wanting it enough. Sadly, science doesn\u2019t support that. \n\nYou love your husband and clearly want a life where he\u2019s free of this burden. I think what you\u2019re hearing here is that hard as it may be, it\u2019s hurting you and hurting him to go on putting things on hold while you wait for a change that may never come. Good luck in finding peace and a life together where you are both fulfilled and both happy and as healthy as possible.", "Keto was something we tried. Sadly the weight went right back on but he lost 60 lbs quickly.", "It was definitely a shock. I think it's what motivated the KETO for about 8 months.", "If his goal is weight loss, I agree with everyone else who has said that activity is far, far secondary to diet. IF your husband wants to lose weight, I would recommend a visit to a bariatrician. There are a lot of meds available that can significantly help, but it has to be a decision that he makes for himself and is ready to commit to. You can\u2019t pressure anyone into getting healthy. Just ask my mom, she forced me through so many diets when I was young and I just got fatter and fatter. I hit my breaking point a couple years ago and was finally ready and able to make some changes with the help of an excellent doctor.", "In reality maybe some of those goals are too intense for many reasons. I am thinking we could make it work on a cruise for sure - lot's of hanging out in a room and downtime.", "And I don't mean than in a negative or demeaning way - once you're working from home it can be so hard to leave! Home is comfy!", " Even under the best circumstances, losing 100 pounds will take at least a year.\n\n\u200b", "Or maybe start going with a friend, so you're not deprived of doing what you love and slip into the same depression/weight gain he did. It's terrible not to be able to make memories together, but it's also terrible not being able to fully live your life due to someone else's choices.", "He was very lucky - no chemo or radiation. The surgeries were very difficult. Long recoveries, pain, he had a drain which was messy. 0/10 would recommend <3", "Yeah... somebody is buying the food, making it etc. How is he consuming so much? He might have binge eating disorder or something.  Nta", "You're getting such a narrow view into their lives and *you're* coming across as judgemental.\n\nHis weight is specifically impacting their plans. It doesn't make her an asshole to give him a reality check before spending thousands of dollars.", "It is extremely common with fad diets, keto especially, to have it work for a while and then fall out of the habit and then re-gain all the weight you lost if not more. If he is motivated and willing to lose weight then you need to find an approach that works for him and is sustainable long term. Which can often require professional help to figure out.", "Not to argue semantics, but I lost 120lbs over the course of 10 months by calorie counting. It was very hard, but it wasn't unsafe, and is completely doable if you're in the right mindset.", "Well glad he is in remission now at least.", "I travelled internationally when I was on dialysis, it just takes a lot of planning as you need to book dialysis sessions in advance in the countries you are travelling to. It can be quite expensive though", "That's not a straw man fallacy lmao. \n\nYou directly compared eating behaviours with incurable diseases. He pointed out how ridiculous it is. And now your using phrases you don't know the meaning of and running off tail between your legs because you're wrong.\n\nSomeone making the point you made sound ridiculous is not arguing in bad faith. It means the point you made was probably ridiculous.\n\nIf your words are being misunderstood, then you clarify them.", "I imagine it would be extremely expensive! (Unless you were an EU citizen and traveled among EU countries.)"]}
