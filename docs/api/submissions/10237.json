When we went on our honeymoon cruise we hardly left the boat - a lot of activities had a limit of 275lbs.\n\nEven last time we flew, he couldn't fit in the seat and had to \"fake\" wearing his seatbelt by tucking it into his stomach.

Please keep in mind that I say all of these things as an overweight cancer survivor, so I can relate to your husband's experience. \n\nThis guy's body has been through A LOT.

Even if he reaches the goal weight, his stamina and physical capabilities may be very different than they were before treatment. Plenty of slim people in my cancer support group mention having lower energy and stamina after cancer. So you might have a new normal to accept. If he's never going to be up for big hikes in Alaska, would you never vacation with him? Are vacations only worthwhile if he can tackle these big activities? Or can you compromise?

He knows you mean him. And if you aren't directly addressing that issue, what else aren't you directly addressing? Does he know about this goal of him losing 100 pounds, or is that something you haven't discussed?

I am finally slowly recovering and also understand how absolutely daunting it can be to know how hard it\u2019s going to be to get that back. I agree with others\u2019 suggestions of smaller trips. You could even use those as rewards! (Ex. 10 lbs= a day trip) I\u2019m finally able to travel about an hour and spend 1/2 day doing short activities, so we plan things that we know I can do successfully so that I don\u2019t get disheartened or feel like I\u2019ve let my husband down.", "My god, maybe stop focusing so much on a VACATION and more on how your husband is doing after surviving all that. Plus, the world is not kind to overweight people - he needs your support, not your judgment. You don't think he feels like shit about weighing 400 pounds?

IF your husband wants to lose weight, I would recommend a visit to a bariatrician. There are a lot of meds available that can significantly help, but it has to be a decision that he makes for himself and is ready to commit to. You can\u2019t pressure anyone into getting healthy. Just ask my mom, she forced me through so many diets when I was young and I just got fatter and fatter. I hit my breaking point a couple years ago and was finally ready and able to make some changes with the help of an excellent doctor.", "In reality maybe some of those goals are too intense for many reasons.

YTA for leaving this out because it\u2019s super relevant. Many dialysis patients suffer from severe fatigue and exhaustion.

Last time I had to have it in the hospital, we joked that every morning was \u2018wake up go to sleep\u2019 bc I\u2019d be woken up, eat breakfast, have my pre treatment Benadryl and Tylenol, and then slump over asleep half an hour into treatment. I felt like I wasn\u2019t maybe fully awake again until midafternoon. \n\nThe fact that a dialysis patient would lose his ability to go any further 3/4 miles from the hotel totally tracks. I used to take a friend of mine with severe kidney failures basically door to door. Unfortunately, she passed due to COVID complications (she contracted it before her second shot\u2014still gotta keep going into a dialysis center despite pandemic). \n\nI know you want him to be healthier and more mobile and hopefully live a long life and do fun things with you\u2014but his medical condition is very serious. You\u2019re not an asshole for not booking trips he can\u2019t reasonably do bc of his physical condition. You won\u2019t be hiking in Alaska with him maybe ever. But taking out anything that requires flights doesn\u2019t seem fair to him if he thinks he can do it. You can book two seats for him, or make sure he\u2019s next to you and on an aisle or window so he\u2019s not interfering with other\u2019s space. Seat belt extenders exist, you can bring your own (they\u2019re not v expensive) or usually just ask for one. \n\nIt\u2019s also harder to do basic weight loss tips on dialysis bc fluid intake is limited, so rule number 1 of \u2018drink a lot of water\u2019 immediately goes out the window. Do not push him to lose weight quickly. A sustainable pace is no more than a pound a week, so it would take him 3 years or so to get to where you met if he steadily lost weight at that pace, and 2 years to get to where you want to be to book flights (which is why I think it\u2019s unfair). Dropping weight faster almost definitely means it\u2019ll come right back. He needs a renal diet savvy nutritionist most likely to work with him to figure out what will make him full.

He needs to use them.", "NTA but you may need to face the reality that big trips will be a solo adventure for you, and your husband will have to sit them out.

You cannot be held back from experiencing the adventures your soul desires on account of a spouse who has become a weight you are unable to drag around. And once you go on the first trip alone, you may find he changes his tune very quickly and starts a journey to health.", "I am obese, like your husband (a lot of things got me to this point), and it is beyond daunting to think about needing to lose all that weight, so I try not to think about the number at all. I'm single, and I LOVE to travel, and I didn't want to have to give that up. I've learned a lot of ways to get where I want to go and enjoy myself. One thing that has helped me a lot over the past year was purchasing an upright rollator walker (OasisSpace has a bariatric one that supports up to 450 lbs). At first, I was embarrassed to use it, but I live in Manhattan, so it's often much faster to get somewhere by walking, even if I'm slow. Instead of taking a hit to my self-esteem, it has helped me build my confidence! Now I'm able to walk to work, and I don't have to refuse every social engagement because I have trouble standing for any length of time. I'm moving so much more than I was a year ago. I'm building strength and stamina, and I'm much happier! Being more active and the increased social activity has almost completely put my chronic depression in remission. It makes travel infinitely easier. As it turns out, no one gives a fuck about whether someone needs a walking aid, and instead of the condescending looks I was expecting, I get kindness and support. It's a difficult journey, and it's taking forever for the numbers to go down on the scale, but my doctor reminded me that the number is not a direct reflection of my health. My body IS moving better than it used to, and my blood test results have improved, including my A1C. I'm just suggesting it because it has helped me to get back to traveling, which I really really love. Also, Southwest Airlines has an amazing person-of-size policy where you can request an extra seat for free when you check in. They say that they will honor the request whether the flight is full or not, but to avoid the possibility of getting bumped to a later flight, I buy the extra seat in advance (it's easier to call to do it than book it online), and then I just email them requesting a refund after the trip is completed. It rarely takes more than a few days for the refund to process. I've utilized this policy at least 30 times, and it has never been an issue. They will also provide wheel chair service to the gate if I'm having a rough leg day. I hope these suggestions are helpful. Most importantly, I hope you will encourage him to utilize resources so that you CAN travel together instead of waiting until he loses x number of pounds.", "NTA.

It\u2019s perfectly reasonable to not want to spend money traveling if you feel like you\u2019re not getting everything out of it you want to.

It\u2019s going to take him awhile to mentally get back on the wagon.\n\nFor the plane thing, if you\u2019re traveling domestic, Southwest has a great customer of size policy where you can book a second seat for free. Also all airlines have seatbelt extenders on hand, you just have to ask the flight attendant so no need to hide an unbuckled belt next time! So if you fly with them and your husband just focuses more on his endurance and less on the number on the scale, you may not have to give him as daunting a weight loss goal. 100 lbs is a big number to hit someone with and with his current habits, is probably very overwhelming.", "INFO: How exactly did you tell him this concern of yours?

But if you actually want to get that vacation in the future, you need to let HIM decide if he wants to lose the weight, and support him through the process of going through all the change that goes along with it.
