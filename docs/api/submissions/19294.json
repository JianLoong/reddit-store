We're both going to the same college, and we're both business majors. I guess we have a lot of common interests. My family talked with her about what she will do in college. She said that she plans to concentrate in marketing (which I also do), and minor in public policy (which I'm also minoring in). The school also has a masters in analytics program which I'll be doing after I finish my undergrad, and my sister is already thinking about doing her masters in analytics. She was also talking about clubs she planned to join once she starts college, and many of those are also clubs I'm in. She's even trying to get into the same freshman dorm I did, and she's looking at joining the same church group I'm in (there's like 10 different church groups on campus).\n\nI casually said that my sister copies everything I do, without making it sound mad or accusatory or anything. But she interpreted things differently and said that I was accusing her of copying me, and that I should be proud of her for getting into the college and having well thought plans. I said that am happy for her, and I was just making a casual comment in a neutral way, but she misunderstood my intentions. She was furious because I made a joke about her and called her a jealous copycat (which is not what I implied or meant at all). I tried to clear things up with her, but my parents said that I shouldn't have made a joke about her.\n\nI said that I didn't make a joke about her, and that I didn't mean anything negative when I said what I said. I then pointed out that they (i.e. my parents and my sister) always make jokes about me that I don't like. For example as a kid I was quite overweight and up to this day they would still joke about it and shame me for it. Or whenever I struggle to use something like a can opener or edge trimmer they would make fun of me and joke that I should be back in kindergarten, which I find quite hurtful. And there's many more examples of that.\n\nI pointed this out to them, and they said that those jokes are \"justified\", while my \"joke\" about my sister was totally malicious, and that I should apologize to her.

See how that\u2019s like.", "NTA\n\nTime to cut these people out of your life.\n\nMaybe you can get into Wharton.", "NTA.  She is copying you and this is definitely a time when I would say that this is very sincere flattery that you have your shit together.  It is obnoxious and rude they make derogatory jokes about the things that challenge you and I hope you are forming a good and nice support group at college and in your future unconnected to your family.  Good luck!", "NTA.  Toxic family, sorry, man.  Get independent  and set healthy boundaries.", "Your family knows their \"jokes\" are malicious and not jokes at all. They are assuming that you are just as mean and nasty as they themselves are, so are making a stink about it.\n\nAnd your sister is copying you and not even trying to hide it. It is an open secret that you aren't supposed to catch onto. \n\nNTA. I'd be doing everything I could do to escape that toxic family of yours though. Keeping contact with them will not do anything good for your self-esteem. And with your sister following in your footsteps, they will work even harder to tear you down so she can shine. Tell them nothing of your plans for the future unless you like having your sister following you forever more."]}
