We're both going to the same college, and we're both business majors. I guess we have a lot of common interests. My family talked with her about what she will do in college. She said that she plans to concentrate in marketing (which I also do), and minor in public policy (which I'm also minoring in). The school also has a masters in analytics program which I'll be doing after I finish my undergrad, and my sister is already thinking about doing her masters in analytics. She was also talking about clubs she planned to join once she starts college, and many of those are also clubs I'm in. She's even trying to get into the same freshman dorm I did, and she's looking at joining the same church group I'm in (there's like 10 different church groups on campus).\n\nI casually said that my sister copies everything I do, without making it sound mad or accusatory or anything. But she interpreted things differently and said that I was accusing her of copying me, and that I should be proud of her for getting into the college and having well thought plans. I said that am happy for her, and I was just making a casual comment in a neutral way, but she misunderstood my intentions. She was furious because I made a joke about her and called her a jealous copycat (which is not what I implied or meant at all). I tried to clear things up with her, but my parents said that I shouldn't have made a joke about her.\n\nI said that I didn't make a joke about her, and that I didn't mean anything negative when I said what I said. I then pointed out that they (i.e. my parents and my sister) always make jokes about me that I don't like. For example as a kid I was quite overweight and up to this day they would still joke about it and shame me for it. Or whenever I struggle to use something like a can opener or edge trimmer they would make fun of me and joke that I should be back in kindergarten, which I find quite hurtful. And there's many more examples of that.\n\nI pointed this out to them, and they said that those jokes are \"justified\", while my \"joke\" about my sister was totally malicious, and that I should apologize to her. I maintained that it was not a joke, and that their jokes about me are wrong.", "created_utc": 1686233738, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/144ah7z/aita_for_making_a_joke_about_my_sister_when_my/", "score": 342, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And you have never cared that you were hurting me. Worse than that, you double down by saying it's \"justified\".  What exactly is \"justified\" about crushing a young girl's spirit and teaching her that her self worth is only what other perceive about her body?
