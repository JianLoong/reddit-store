It\u2019s literally a banana, a scoop of peanut butter and a cup of oats. That\u2019s it. \n\nAnyways, Lucy was fussing and Jane tells me that she\u2019s in the teething process and asked if I could freeze some of the baby food for when she needed to eat in an hour or so. I agreed and asked if she wanted to give Lucy a frozen peanut butter oat ball. Jane agreed and Lucy loved it. \r\n\nAbout 2 hours into the visit, my housemates gets back with her dog and goes into the freezer to get one of the frozen treats and my sister gets all antsy. Mum and I ask what\u2019s wrong and she asks if I made the treats for Lucy. I said no, they\u2019re technically for the dog, but It\u2019s safe for human consumption. \r\n\nJane freaks out and picks Lucy up and goes to the car. She\u2019s crying about how I gave her daughter \u2018dog food\u2019 and how I should have disclosed that it was made for a dog, but I didn\u2019t think it mattered. It didn\u2019t have dog-only ingredients or anything. \r\n\nI tried to talk to Jane but she won\u2019t respond and is genuinely insisting that I fed her daughter dog food.
