{"id": 22933, "submission_id": "157988w", "title": "AITA for ordering an expensive dish on a group couple outing", "selftext": "My husband and I regularly go out with four other couples except this time there was a new couple that came along. Each couple pays for their own meal.  Everything is expensive. Everything is \u00e0 la carte. So we ordered the tomahawk steak with a vegetable and with a lobster mac and cheese and one with mashed potatoes because I\u2019m pregnant and can\u2019t eat seafood. My husband also ordered a really expensive bottle of wine but offers it to the rest of the table after he poureds himself a glass letting them know that it\u2019s on him. \n\nThe couple that is new to the group is looking at us strangely and comments about us ordering the most expensive steak on the menu. She just looked at me and said \u201c Way to flaunt your money around!\u201d  So I looked at her and I said \u201cexcuse me\u201d. She said  \u201cwell you didn\u2019t have to order the most expensive items on the menu\u201d I said \u201c well the last time I checked my husband and I were paying for ourselves so we order what we like. If you have a problem with it, that problem resides with you. I have no problem with the fact you ordered the cheapest thing on the menu, because I\u2019m not paying for you. So please don\u2019t try to count my money and I won\u2019t count yours\u201d. My husband makes a joke to try to make light of the situation and everyone laughs. At the end of dinner I go to the ladies room, when I come out of the stall she\u2019s there waiting for me and she says \u201c I really don\u2019t appreciate how pretentious you and you\u2019re husband are with ordering the most expensive food on the menu!\u201d  I told her we all paid for our own food  and ours were not the most expensive things on the menu as they were dishes that were more expensive and I didn\u2019t appreciate her being in my business and considering that she\u2019s new to our group trying to imply that I\u2019m somehow being pretentious when she doesn\u2019t know me and then I told her to tell me she\u2019s jealous without telling me she\u2019s jealous. Then I told her if she doesn\u2019t have enough money she should keep her broke ass home!\u201d I know it was mean but I found her audacity disgusting and I just wanted to put her in her place and I felt like she was trying to bully me for whatever her reasons are. I don\u2019t really care.\n\nMy longest friend in the group text me saying that I offended the new couple and should apologize . I asked apologize for what?  Should I apologize for her assuming I\u2019m pretentious or should I apologize to her for not being able to or not wanting to order what we ordered. I\u2019m really confused about what I should be apologizing for? So I asked her did she tell you what she said to me also and then she was literally waiting outside of my bathroom stall for me to come out. She said yeah she told me So I asked how do you feel that I should apologize? So my friend said that the other woman\u2019s feelings were really hurt and she was crying. I tell my friend my feelings were hurt when she attacked me? I basically told her I would not be apologizing and when you mess with the bull you get the horns!.  So AITA?\n\nUPDATE: \nI called my friend and told her that I would not be apologizing and if she did not want me and my husband to be a part of the friend group anymore then that's on them. She told me that the other girl said that her and her husband would not be a part of the friend group anymore, especially if I was going to be at any of the dinners. She informed her that I have been in this group since the very beginning So I wasn't going anywhere even though she agreed with her to some extent. \n\nI asked her if she wanted me in the other girl in a neutral party who was there to all get together and have a cup of coffee or tea and try and hash it out so no one had to leave the group. She said she was amenable to that so we met about 45 minutes ago. \n\nAs soon as we get there the new girl starts with her crocodile tears and I cut in and let her know that her tears me nothing to me and they don't make me feel sorry in any way so she can cut it. \n\nOur neutral party who was there, rehash would happen and rehashed was she heard happened in the bathroom and we both agreed to what was said. The solution was that we were to agree to disagree because neither of us was willing to apologize and we were to never bring this up again and agree that what another person orders is. No one else's business and no one is to comment on what another person orders.  The new girl disagreed she felt that it was pretentious to order with someone else can afford to order. I said how are we to know what you can and can't afford? None of us know what you have in your bank account nor do you know what we have in ours and why should anyone limit themselves based on what you can't afford or what anyone else can't afford?  So I said I agree to disagree. I agree that I will not nor have I ever commented on what someone else ordered, but I will not be ordering based on what someone else can or cannot afford that is not my business. The other two ladies, my friend and the neutral party agreed with me and the other girl said that she won't come out as long as I'm in the group and the neutral party said that I would always be in the group so If that is the case then she is saying that she is out of the group and that was that.", "created_utc": 1690101027, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/157988w/aita_for_ordering_an_expensive_dish_on_a_group/", "score": 6803, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That. You're an asshole for that. The way she was bitching about being pretentious, it wasn't true until right there. Even what you said, you were just replying to her bullshit. I wouldn't say it was uncalled for, mean, yes, but she literally waited for you in the bathroom to continue.\n\nIt's the way you put it here though. *Put her in her place.* Yeah.

Thats on her to manage not on you. I don\u2019t see why you should apologise.\n\nBut you can have empathy and understanding for those situations and if you have friends who have less money tone it down or ask to go for inexpensive activities.

Just curious, ha.) \n\nI realize that to you it feels like everyone should just mind their own business, but I think it's worth knowing that a LOT of people who flash wealth around like you seem to are...bad people. Abusers cultivating an image of \"generosity\" that they then use later to manipulate others. Users living outside their means, and always begging friends to supplement their lifestyle. Wanna-be \"influencers\" who think rules don't apply to them. I'm not saying you're one of them, but I used to waitress, and the people who \"order big\" can often be just the worst folks in the world to serve.

That said, she shouldn't have come for your throat like she did. \n\nTL;DR: I think the other diner was wrong for coming at you so hard and accusing you of flaunting your wealth. But I also think you need to recognize that kind of wealth display is unsettling and even a little gross. (I remember when one celebrity got run off social media for telling a \"funny story\" where her husband ordered, like, a $15,000 bottle of wine. It's less funny to people in need, etc.) You may want to learn how to respond politely even when you don't feel like it. It does seem like you escalated this situation, imo. \n\nESH, I guess.", "Meh.
