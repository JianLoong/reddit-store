Each couple pays for their own meal.  Everything is expensive. Everything is \u00e0 la carte. So we ordered the tomahawk steak with a vegetable and with a lobster mac and cheese and one with mashed potatoes because I\u2019m pregnant and can\u2019t eat seafood. My husband also ordered a really expensive bottle of wine but offers it to the rest of the table after he poureds himself a glass letting them know that it\u2019s on him. \n\nThe couple that is new to the group is looking at us strangely and comments about us ordering the most expensive steak on the menu. She just looked at me and said \u201c Way to flaunt your money around!\u201d  So I looked at her and I said \u201cexcuse me\u201d. She said  \u201cwell you didn\u2019t have to order the most expensive items on the menu\u201d I said \u201c well the last time I checked my husband and I were paying for ourselves so we order what we like. If you have a problem with it, that problem resides with you. I have no problem with the fact you ordered the cheapest thing on the menu, because I\u2019m not paying for you. So please don\u2019t try to count my money and I won\u2019t count yours\u201d. My husband makes a joke to try to make light of the situation and everyone laughs. At the end of dinner I go to the ladies room, when I come out of the stall she\u2019s there waiting for me and she says \u201c I really don\u2019t appreciate how pretentious you and you\u2019re husband are with ordering the most expensive food on the menu!\u201d  I told her we all paid for our own food  and ours were not the most expensive things on the menu as they were dishes that were more expensive and I didn\u2019t appreciate her being in my business and considering that she\u2019s new to our group trying to imply that I\u2019m somehow being pretentious when she doesn\u2019t know me and then I told her to tell me she\u2019s jealous without telling me she\u2019s jealous. Then I told her if she doesn\u2019t have enough money she should keep her broke ass home!\u201d I know it was mean but I found her audacity disgusting and I just wanted to put her in her place and I felt like she was trying to bully me for whatever her reasons are. I don\u2019t really care.\n\nMy longest friend in the group text me saying that I offended the new couple and should apologize . I asked apologize for what?  Should I apologize for her assuming I\u2019m pretentious or should I apologize to her for not being able to or not wanting to order what we ordered. I\u2019m really confused about what I should be apologizing for? So I asked her did she tell you what she said to me also and then she was literally waiting outside of my bathroom stall for me to come out. She said yeah she told me So I asked how do you feel that I should apologize? So my friend said that the other woman\u2019s feelings were really hurt and she was crying. I tell my friend my feelings were hurt when she attacked me? I basically told her I would not be apologizing and when you mess with the bull you get the horns!.

Thats on her to manage not on you.

Just curious, ha.) \n\nI realize that to you it feels like everyone should just mind their own business, but I think it's worth knowing that a LOT of people who flash wealth around like you seem to are...bad people.

Of course, but she is human and dealing with pregnancy hormones, and was justifiably fed up with the aggressive stance this woman had taken during dinner and then literally stalked her in the restroom.

So deep fried is in fact special\u201c so a nicely aged stake is special because most people don\u2019t have the time or resources to age them, lobster some thing, and I mean even the Mac and cheese does it have truffle because that is not something I get at home. Sooo really it all sounds like it fits my \u201cnot at home\u201c guild lines", "Exactly. I'm also a SAHM and when the stars align with childcare & finances, we go out for something super nice.  But even if we ate like that once a week, it's no one's business! How we spend our disposable income is our concern.", "Tell him Peter.", "IRL, this is a bizarre situation though. Being called out *twice* simply for ordering items that were more expensive? If anyone is acting like a Real Housewife, it\u2019s the woman talking shit about how much OP spent at dinner. Like who actually cares? One could argue that calling someone unhinged is *also* mean. I think the perfect reaction in the bathroom would have been to say, \u201cYou are out of line and I\u2019m not engaging in this conversation with you any longer.\u201d That would have been the best way to shut it down. But most people forced into confrontation that takes them by surprise do not respond perfectly. If OP\u2019s account of the incident is true, than yes, she could have responded better both times. But the person who acted completely inappropriately and made the situation awkward in the first place was not OP, it was the new person. While two wrongs don\u2019t make a right, we shouldn\u2019t forget this entire drama was created and started by the new person to the group. It was wildly out of line. IMO there\u2019s *more* culpability in creating the situation than being forced to react to it.", "Sometimes one person is simply telling the truth and the other isn\u2019t. Calm down.", "God I've never seen so many comments supporting the person that literally caused the confrontation and for such a stupid ass reason.\nThey really want to make it OP\u2019s fault for just standing up for herself.", "If anyone was rude it was the self righteous woman! Who cares what OP and her husband orders, it's not like she's paying for it! I Personally think she got what she deserved.", "Absolutely correct", "Only one person did - the person newcomer literally cried to. It\u2019s not surprising that friend felt sympathy and wanted to fix the hurt feelings after seeing her tears. But rather than trying to procure a forced and insincere apology from OP, she should\u2019ve gently wiped away her friend\u2019s tears, leaned in and whispered to her\u2026 \u201cdon\u2019t start none, won\u2019t be none\u201d.\n\nEdit: a word", "You\u2019re giving us bits and pieces about your personality and honestly, I\u2019m not surprised you\u2019re being seen as feeling superior to others.", "When I read your post, I was thinking NTA. As I continue to read your responses in the thread YTA. \n\nI am picturing you as someone who also snaps their finger and moves their head when responding.", "One person's truth is still skewed by their emotions, assumptions, prior experiences, etc, and is missing key context from the other side of the story. Nobody is really ever capable of telling the 'whole truth' unless no other person was involved.", "This new chick would have been FINE if she had just sat there and ate her food! OP wouldn\u2019t have said anything to her or treated her any less, she didn\u2019t initiate commenting about her finances or food order!\n\nWhen did the standard for \u201cappropriate behavior\u201d become silently taking any and all vitriol people fling at you??", "Peace keepers are the most annoying. If you want to bend over for everyone go right ahead, but stop pushing your bullshit on other people.", "I would imagine the other sides version of the story was told without mentioning it was her that waited for OP in the bathroom and that they started it", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 This needs to be a meme", "Lol and there it is. The real reason why you all are saying she's the asshole. That cism just jumps out at every turn.", "exactly the thought I had", "Right! They act like OP should've just sat there and said nothing or babied her and held her hand whilst gently explaining how it's not her business lmao\n\nNew girl caused the whole situation, cornered OP, and then threw a pity party for some sympathy. \nThe fact people wanna call OP the asshole for just literally giving back the exact same attitude she was receiving is just ridiculous.", "Lol I am not a peace keeper, you wanna rock this boat\u2026.. I will flip this boat and then we\u2019ll all suffer\u2026. I almost enjoy putting peace keepers in between a rock and hard place. That said I generally don\u2019t start rocking the boat.", "It seems like everyone else is causing issues for the peacekeepers with their drama"]}
