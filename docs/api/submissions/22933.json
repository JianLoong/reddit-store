Each couple pays for their own meal.  Everything is expensive. Everything is \u00e0 la carte. So we ordered the tomahawk steak with a vegetable and with a lobster mac and cheese and one with mashed potatoes because I\u2019m pregnant and can\u2019t eat seafood. My husband also ordered a really expensive bottle of wine but offers it to the rest of the table after he poureds himself a glass letting them know that it\u2019s on him. \n\nThe couple that is new to the group is looking at us strangely and comments about us ordering the most expensive steak on the menu. She just looked at me and said \u201c Way to flaunt your money around!\u201d  So I looked at her and I said \u201cexcuse me\u201d. She said  \u201cwell you didn\u2019t have to order the most expensive items on the menu\u201d I said \u201c well the last time I checked my husband and I were paying for ourselves so we order what we like. If you have a problem with it, that problem resides with you. I have no problem with the fact you ordered the cheapest thing on the menu, because I\u2019m not paying for you. So please don\u2019t try to count my money and I won\u2019t count yours\u201d. My husband makes a joke to try to make light of the situation and everyone laughs. At the end of dinner I go to the ladies room, when I come out of the stall she\u2019s there waiting for me and she says \u201c I really don\u2019t appreciate how pretentious you and you\u2019re husband are with ordering the most expensive food on the menu!\u201d  I told her we all paid for our own food  and ours were not the most expensive things on the menu as they were dishes that were more expensive and I didn\u2019t appreciate her being in my business and considering that she\u2019s new to our group trying to imply that I\u2019m somehow being pretentious when she doesn\u2019t know me and then I told her to tell me she\u2019s jealous without telling me she\u2019s jealous. Then I told her if she doesn\u2019t have enough money she should keep her broke ass home!\u201d I know it was mean but I found her audacity disgusting and I just wanted to put her in her place and I felt like she was trying to bully me for whatever her reasons are. I don\u2019t really care.\n\nMy longest friend in the group text me saying that I offended the new couple and should apologize . I asked apologize for what?  Should I apologize for her assuming I\u2019m pretentious or should I apologize to her for not being able to or not wanting to order what we ordered. I\u2019m really confused about what I should be apologizing for? So I asked her did she tell you what she said to me also and then she was literally waiting outside of my bathroom stall for me to come out. She said yeah she told me So I asked how do you feel that I should apologize? So my friend said that the other woman\u2019s feelings were really hurt and she was crying. I tell my friend my feelings were hurt when she attacked me? I basically told her I would not be apologizing and when you mess with the bull you get the horns!.
