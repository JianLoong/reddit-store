Each couple pays for their own meal.  Everything is expensive. Everything is \u00e0 la carte. So we ordered the tomahawk steak with a vegetable and with a lobster mac and cheese and one with mashed potatoes because I\u2019m pregnant and can\u2019t eat seafood. My husband also ordered a really expensive bottle of wine but offers it to the rest of the table after he poureds himself a glass letting them know that it\u2019s on him. \n\nThe couple that is new to the group is looking at us strangely and comments about us ordering the most expensive steak on the menu. She just looked at me and said \u201c Way to flaunt your money around!\u201d  So I looked at her and I said \u201cexcuse me\u201d. She said  \u201cwell you didn\u2019t have to order the most expensive items on the menu\u201d I said \u201c well the last time I checked my husband and I were paying for ourselves so we order what we like. If you have a problem with it, that problem resides with you. I have no problem with the fact you ordered the cheapest thing on the menu, because I\u2019m not paying for you. So please don\u2019t try to count my money and I won\u2019t count yours\u201d. My husband makes a joke to try to make light of the situation and everyone laughs. At the end of dinner I go to the ladies room, when I come out of the stall she\u2019s there waiting for me and she says \u201c I really don\u2019t appreciate how pretentious you and you\u2019re husband are with ordering the most expensive food on the menu!\u201d  I told her we all paid for our own food  and ours were not the most expensive things on the menu as they were dishes that were more expensive and I didn\u2019t appreciate her being in my business and considering that she\u2019s new to our group trying to imply that I\u2019m somehow being pretentious when she doesn\u2019t know me and then I told her to tell me she\u2019s jealous without telling me she\u2019s jealous. Then I told her if she doesn\u2019t have enough money she should keep her broke ass home!\u201d I know it was mean but I found her audacity disgusting and I just wanted to put her in her place and I felt like she was trying to bully me for whatever her reasons are. I don\u2019t really care.\n\nMy longest friend in the group text me saying that I offended the new couple and should apologize . I asked apologize for what?  Should I apologize for her assuming I\u2019m pretentious or should I apologize to her for not being able to or not wanting to order what we ordered. I\u2019m really confused about what I should be apologizing for? So I asked her did she tell you what she said to me also and then she was literally waiting outside of my bathroom stall for me to come out. She said yeah she told me So I asked how do you feel that I should apologize? So my friend said that the other woman\u2019s feelings were really hurt and she was crying. I tell my friend my feelings were hurt when she attacked me? I basically told her I would not be apologizing and when you mess with the bull you get the horns!.

And that if we heard the version of events off the other couple, we'd be hearing something entirely different\n\nThe truth is probably somewhere in the middle perhaps? And you're just coming on here to seek validation and make yourself feel better?\n\nBecause, despite her attitude, you in the above story took shots at her being poor on two separate occasions.\n\nThe first where you said:\n\n>I have no problem with the fact you ordered the cheapest thing on the menu\n\nAnd the second where you said:\n\n>I told her if she doesn\u2019t have enough money she should keep her broke ass home\u201d\n\nWhich suggests to me there may be some truth to the other lady saying you flaunt your money and look down your nose at other people. Because your retorts there, may be indicative of how you think and feel about other folk\n\nAnd also, the fact that your friend (likely to be neutral and have much better visibility than any of us as to what actually happened) has taken sides with HER, speaks volumes. Even she is saying you were out of line.\n\nSo are you the asshole? You may be.

The price of what you ordered was absolutely none of her business, and criticizing you for it was way out of line.  Your comeback was not disproportionate.

Come on, folks.\n\nIf the new member cried, it was because when she picked a fight and doubled down,  you didn't take her insults and demeaning assumptions lying down.\n\nPerhaps the friend who is defending her should engage in some 1:1 activities with her, as if I were you, I'd avoid socializing with someone who attacks me out of the blue because she doesn't like the price of my entree.\n\nNTA", "NTA: I don't get all the Y T As and E S Hs.

It would be one thing if you ordered the most expensive thing and tried to do the \"split evenly\" business, but that was not the case.  What you ordered was absolutely none of her business.\n\nIt is rude to comment on what people choose to eat and how much it cost.  That lady should not have made the comment, especially not in front of everyone.  Then to double down by following you into the bathroom is very weird.  She was projecting her insecurities onto you.", "ESH\n\nShe was the asshole. She never should've made a snarky comment, she never should've doubled down in the bathroom that was weird and made her a super asshole, but right here;\n\n>I know it was mean but I found her audacity disgusting and *I just wanted to put her in her place*\n\nYeah. That. You're an asshole for that. The way she was bitching about being pretentious, it wasn't true until right there. Even what you said, you were just replying to her bullshit. I wouldn't say it was uncalled for, mean, yes, but she literally waited for you in the bathroom to continue.\n\nIt's the way you put it here though. *Put her in her place.* Yeah. Everyone sucks in this story.", "NTA, but should have kept your cool in the bathroom. \n\nI wonder why she was so offended by you ordering the most expensive thing on the menu. Also, very entitled to confront you about that on the FIRST dinner you have together.", "NTA If she feels that uncomfortable by you ordering more expensive food than her she can\u2019t be friends with people with a different social economic background. We can\u2019t lash out at people who have an aspect of life that\u2019s seemingly better than ours. Accusing people of \u201eFlaunting a relationship\u201c when your single. Thats on her to manage not on you. I don\u2019t see why you should apologise.\n\nBut you can have empathy and understanding for those situations and if you have friends who have less money tone it down or ask to go for inexpensive activities. Everyone likes to feel equal and it makes you a kinder friend.\n\nNot to her she should mind her own business. Who thinks it\u2019s acceptable to corner someone they are just starting to get to know at the toilette and accuse them of being a rich asshole. \nSadly with you last comment you probably hit the mark of her insecurities.

She got what she deserved with her BS. There\u2019s so much harassment that goes on with people who have more money. It\u2019s not acceptable to be judging people either way, whether they have more money or less. \n\nShe was judging you because you seem to have more money.", "NTA. It kinda sounds like a rich people problem. Even though the woman was rude, you should get used to such comments if you hang out with people with a lower tax bracket than yours. People are jealous.", "NTA. She started attacking you in front of your whole friend group and you defended yourself. You didn\u2019t say anything bad to her that she didn\u2019t say to you. As a society we have normalised hating on people with money and I think this is where a lot of the YTA comments are coming from. I think your last comment to her was a bit much but I can also only imagine how angry you were at this point. She insulted you and then, followed you to the stall which is even more deranged. \n\nI think the main problem here is your friend group. Have an honest conversation with your other friends if they have ever felt like you are looking down on them because of money. It\u2019s either you are actually doing something wrong, or they are all jealous, so they are enabling this woman. \n\nI don\u2019t think you are TA in this situation but you should definitely explore the reasons why no one stood up for you.", "NTA.

And I almost always try to plan it for a lunch because most places have cheaper lunch plates. \n\nMy best friends are both people who never have to look at the prices and can order what they want, I have no problem going out with them as long as it\u2019s to the places I can afford myself.
