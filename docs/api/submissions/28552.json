Newsflash people! They wear glasses because they can't see without them, and contacts aren't an option for everyone. Rant over, but it is also not your fault. Glasses breaking is just something you have to deal with sometimes when wearing glasses. NTA\n\nEdit: Yes , I know sports glasses exist. But in the US they aren't common or required. Maybe they should be, but that isn't up to me.", "NTA. I say this as someone that wears glasses and won't wear contacts, there are activities such as sports where you assume risk of breakage. But saying he chose to keep them on is not the way to go about this, glasses are a medical assistance device, it's not really a choice. Have him check with the school, they usually have some sort of liability insurance on students, PE is required, volleyball is a required unit, that should fall under coverage.", "This is something the adults need to figure out. It\u2019s one of those things that happens when kids who wear glasses engage in physical activities. \n\nOne of my kids went through several pairs of glasses growing up and the places we bought them always included repairs on kids\u2019 glasses. It saved us a fortune.", "NTA\n\nI would speak to a school advisor, or equivalent, at the school explaining the situation and asking their advice. \n\nThis was an organised PE event, not an optional activity, and the glasses were not broken with malicious intent. Teachers overseeing the class should advise those wearing glasses of the dangers of accidental damage occurring during an event such as volleyball, basketball etc. and that any damage is 'at their own risk'.\n\nDepending on the schools answer you would be within your rights to refuse to engage in PE sports with anyone wearing glasses in the future.", "Hey. Depending on the country, this could fall under the schools insurance responsibility. A classmate of mine broke my teeth during lunch break back in 4th grade and the school's insurance had to pay for it. This was in Denmark btw. \n\nNAH. You didn't do anything wrong by accidentally breaking his glasses, he didn't do anything wrong by wearing his glasses.\n\nBe a good guy and suggest he ask the school about their insurance policy. Who knows, maybe you'll make a friend from it.", "NTA. I play tennis and wear prescription sunglasses. If someone hits me in the face during play, it's either a total fluke or it's because I got close to the net and they had to back me off\u2014not trying to hit my face, but trying to hit my chest, that's just how the sport is played. If I didn't turn away or get my racket up in time to block the shot, that's on me. So how are you supposed to play volleyball without ever hitting a ball in your opponent's direction? You can't. That's just part of the sport. I will add, if someone hits a tennis ball when play is over, and it hits me and breaks my glasses, THEN they need to pay. And also be thrown out of the match, because that is NOT part of the sport.", "yeah, nta, you didn't break them on purpose.  he should have taken them off, swapped them out for sport glasses, or not played / gotten a waiver or permission to sit out (because getting hit in the face while wearing glasses could end up badly lol).\n\nthat's on the teacher and the student, not you.", "[deleted]", "ESH\n\nI'm was quite blind in highschool and wore glasses. I couldn't wear contacts at the time due to a cylinder in my eyes. PE including ball sports was mandatory. I wasn't allowed to skip it easy as and I could not take my glasses of as my eyesight is on -13 I would not see the ball or ever people.\nSo saying \"just take your glasses of, is a shortsighted (hehe) thing to say.\n\nBut.. on the other hand, everyone with glasses knows these things happen which is why you have insurance on them. The kid blaming you and wanting  you to pay isn't really fair. He should sort it with the insurance.", "NTA but everyone saying oh why isn't he wearing contacts ? Don't know about America but they can be expensive here, especially with the cost of living. And buying sports glasses for a PE class that is usually one hour a week is very over the top and also expensive!!", "NTA. unfortunately as much as it sucks having broken glasses ( i would know. my last pair broke and i had them taped together for months until i could get new ones ) it was an accident, and you risk breaking your glasses pretty much every day, especially with sports or PE. but you must realize it\u2019s not his fault for wearing glasses, if he had them on while playing, he most likely wouldn\u2019t even be able to play without them. i can\u2019t do much without my own glasses. but the only thing that can be said is an apology, because while it\u2019s a crappy day for everyone involved, it was an accident", "NTA. He can go after the school, but breaking glasses during volleyball is a predictable risk, and you didn't do anything reckless. If the school doesn't help, his parents just buy new frames, like my parents had to so many times.", "NTA because I don't think you should have to pay for the repair. This is just an unfortunate risk associated with wearing glasses. \n\nHOWEVER! You were an asshole for suggesting he just remove his glasses for PE. People wear glasses so they can see. It's not as easy as just taking them off for a subject. Glasses are medically prescribed.\n\nFor me, I can get away with not wearing my glasses for a shower. Anything more than that will trigger eye pain, dizziness, headaches, or sometimes even migraines.", "NTA. Accidents happen! They just happen. They're no one's fault (usually) but there seems to be a prevailing mindset that there MUST be someone to blame and that person MUST assume responsibility. If you trip on a rock on the sidewalk and break your glasses, are you going to make the landowner pay for the glasses? No! You were playing a sport and I'm guessing playing it properly and it just happened. Sucks but it's not your responsibility.", "ESH\n\n>told him its his own fault for choosing to keep the glasses on during sports.\n\nThat's why you are an AH in this scenario.\n\n>hes saying its my fault and i should pay for it\n\nAnd that's why he is an AH. \n\nIf someone told me to just \"take my glasses off during sports\", I'd question their ability to understand the function of glasses. At the same time that's why my glasses are insured and I have insurance in general - glasses (at least in germany) can be freaking expensive and *accidents* just happen. Demanding someone else to pay for an accident is just shitty - but so is telling someone to just go around unable to properly see.\n\nContact lenses btw are not for everyone, and not everyone can even wear them, so there's that.", "NTA, on the assumption you're a child under school supervision. In the UK, the school would be liable - in that they have the duty of care to ensure the activities are safe, and would be responsible for damage that could reasonably be expected from their actions taken. No idea where you are, though. If you're both adults, then he could certainly make that claim. Legally I would be surprised if any court anywhere would uphold it being your fault.\n\nThis isn't really a case of AH or NTA. This is just liability. If your friend wants to talk liability with you, then suggest an initial session to mediate a solution with his parents and the school present. My guess is he's asking you to pay so he doesn't have to tell his parents he broke his glasses by wearing them playing sports, or it's some sort of targeted bullying attempt on you. Either way, don't give in, and if pushed, turn it into a legal claim - most places have a courts system for low value disagreements like this.", "\"i refused and told him its his own fault for choosing to keep the glasses on during sports.\"\n\nYTA and an ableist one at that.", "NTA Glasses wearer. Not your fault.", "NTA. I wear glasses, can't see without them. I don't really play sports where projectiles fly around cause of this. You can't be expected to play extra careful around one person during PE.", "NTA. He should have goggles or wear contacts if he's going to be playing any sport. 100% on him.", "I wear glasses. I'd never wear them while playing volleyball. NTA. He can go buy another pair off Zenni.", "if you play sports with glasses you are taking a risk. if she catches the ball with the face in a nin malicous way that is her problem. heck, i broke 2 pairs as well and went on playing without glasses. it sucks tho, seeing the ball literally 2 meters before your face. NTA", "YTA, Not for refusing to pay, all glasses wearers assume the risk that they will get broken when we are doing certain activities and that we will be responsible to get them fixed if they do. \n\nYou, however, are TA for how you responded. You could have just left it at \"no\", and then gone to the teacher together to talk about it. You could have also simply said nothing at all, but you had to tell them that it's fully their fault because they need to wear glasses to see in order to participate. It is not his fault that the glasses are broken simply because he needed to wear them. This was just an accident, no one is really \"at fault\", assuming you didn't purposely aim for his face, that is.", "NTA, you didn't do it on purpose and wearing glasses during sports is risky.

Regardless of whether you need to pay for it or not, you\u2019re basically blaming him for wanting to keep his vision while playing sports.", "YTA here because people with glasses generally need them to see, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to see well enough to play otherwise.

It's his choice to wear glasses during sports and his glasses should be insured. Accidents with glasses happen, not only during sports but in many other situations as well.

Accidents happen, but if you break something on accident, you still broke something. You'd be responsible for it.

But understand that not every kid can just take off their glasses and be alright.\n\nI'm assuming this is in either middle or high school, but in either case, the school should be mediating the situation between your parents.

Not their fault here and they shouldn't pay for glasses.", "I agree", "Ah that makes sense then, I wear the specialised contacts for astigmatism. I just hate wearing glasses so I'm hoping I can stick with contacts forever.", "200$? Maybe in the states, in Canada that would run you 600$ \n\nAlso, I did gym everyday with glasses for middle/highschool and not once did I break my glasses. The trick is to have them adjusted (for free!) To actually fit my face.", "Yes obviously it\u2019s a mandatory class but you don\u2019t have to do every single sport, the teachers also need to consider the students needs as well. \n\nWhat if a student was unable to walk and they were doing gymnastics? Would they force her to participate even if she\u2019s unable? Would they dial her as she\u2019s not able to do the mandatory class", "Pretty bad teacher then, I\u2019d sit it out anyway and bring it up to the principal if the teacher was to try and force me to play. \n\nDodge ball at that level is almost guaranteed to get hit in the face at least once, why would you keep ur glasses on for that or why would you put ur glasses at risk", "> I can only assume you (and others saying the same) never wore contacts otherwise you wouldnt sell it as easy as wearing socks\n\nNice try, tree-hugger. I wore contacts all through school. But thanks for playing.", "I had to switch to the astigmatism contacts a few years ago. It was 3 months of feeling like there was a jagged shard of glass in my eyes. Been fine since though. That's how much I hate glasses. \n\nBut my vision is horrific uncorrected and I couldn't stand the loss of peripheral vision. Like I can't read my phone unless it's less than an inch from my nose sort of bad. Lol\n\nMy Mom was able to wear contacts into her 60's, and she had the old hard contacts.", "I wont answer you further because you can't be serious right now. Children with glasses are nearly never allowed to not participate. A child not able to walk will do nearly no sport and have a doctors note. This is frankly just ridicoulus.", "Nice that you had an easy prescription and your parents could afford it and/or had excellent insurance.  A lot of people are less fortunate.", "I\u2019m quite short sighted, but I can use my phone and read etc. as normal now, as long as I put my glasses on top of my head, anything further away is just a giant blurry mess until I put my glasses on. It\u2019s funny that as I\u2019m getting older the longsightedness you tend to get from aging (why so many older people end up with specs) is helping keep my shortsightedness steady. I\u2019ve had the same prescription for the last three visits. I\u2019m going again in a week or so, I don\u2019t expect it to have changed dramatically (I\u2019m sure it will have changed, but nothing I\u2019ve noticed)."]}
