I would suggest that you might want to record yourself giving the warning and listen to playback just to make sure there wasn't a tone of voice or word choice that might have triggered the reaction, but even then, trying to keep someone from having to deal.with the discomfort of a skin reaction is a good thing.", "NTA.

I would have wanted to know if they are touching possibly dangerous plants. \n\nSo don't worry, maybe she was stressed or feels that she is always right. \n\nYou did the right thing!", "NTA Even some teachers are aware that parents nowadays refused to act like a real parent. They just give a child a phone device to keep them entertained and let their child do whatever they want with no consequences.", "If you did it in an informative and not accusatory tone, then NTA.", "NTA.\n\nFYI, there is probably a way to share that information that would feel less like an insult.\n\n\"Hey, that's (itchy plant) - last time I held it I got a rash\".    Same information but leaves out the \"you shouldn't\" part.", "NTA unless you kept on about it, which you didn't. Good on you for being kind, many people are oblivious or plant blind.", "NTA. Just spreading harmless concern.\n\nIn my experience, some parent's need to be informed about something like this in the most general way possible or they'll think your attacking their parenting skills.\n\n\"That plant is poisonous\" sounds less condescending than \"Hey you shouldn't let your kid pick that up\" to these people. It's super weird and highlights some insecurity, but it's something I've learned working around parents of young kids. Not saying you didn't do this I just felt like sharing", "NTA. You were just concerned and wanted to tell the mom about potential risks, if she chooses not to listen, that\u2019s her fault.", "NTA.\n\nYou're a good person and the mum either didn't understand what you were saying or was embarrassed. She sounds kind of awful.", "Not your fault, but since people do get defensive about their parenting, next time you could just say, \"Hey I just want to let you know, some of those plants can cause itchiness similar to poison ivy.\"\n\nDon't even mention the child or what she \"shouldn't\" do. Just mention the plants.\n\nNAH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
