Let's call him Gray. It may not be something too deep so I was flattered. i let him know i wasn't interested since i just got out of a long relationship.\n\nA month after this rejection Gray asked me to be his girlfriend. Again, i rejected. He said it's cool, but he'd appreciate it if i didn't cut him off. I didn't, as he was a nice friend to have. I had to reiterate to him more than once after this that there is no chance i'm reciprocating the feelings at all.\n\nOne day one of my closer coworkers let me know that Gray would ask her what my plans for the day were, and if i had any he'd ask where i'd be going and who i'd be with. He'd also ask her if i was hanging around any other male coworkers.\n\nOne time when we were out for a lunch with the team, our boss gave us the rest of the day off. that meant we'd be free to go home or hang out after lunch. I told everyone i'd be off home as i was too tired. He offered to bring me home and i declined. He snapped and started almost begging to bring me home but i just kept declining. He then said fine let me book you a taxi home and proceeded to type my address correctly when i know for a fact i never gave him my address. I was majorly uncomfortable at this point.\n\nHe's done weirder things over the past year - stalking my family on social media, memorizing usernames of my close friends on ig, he even found an old twt acc i wasn't using anymore, ship products he bought online directly to my address, even got on a taxi and followed mine home. When i confronted him about it he said he just wanted to make sure i was safe.\n\nLast week while preparing to go home it started to rain so he insisted to bring me home on his motorcycle. he followed me around the office just going \"please let me bring you home\". we were around other coworkers but i snapped at him and told him to f off and leave me alone in a rather high voice. a coworker (who was aware of the stories i told above) overheard and told me i didn't have to react that way. i talked to a (non coworker) friend about it and he told me this might be gray's way of \"winning me over\". now i'm worried that i'm just viewing him as annoying and stalker-ish bc i didn't reciprocate the feelings and went off on him when he was being kind.

They obviously don't understand/care about your situation if they know the stories and expect you to always be calm. Majorly pissed at that scene extra.\n\nAnyways, report him.

Right now he is in the fantasy stage where he is delusional enough to believe that you two are meant to be if he can just convince you of it. \n\nOnce he moves out of that, which it sounds like he is moving into obsession, he will begin to get angry. Anger is going to lead to increased stalking and more packages (it will be come a war of attrition).

So, I ended a 7 year relationship a little over a year ago. This was around the same time i got into the job i have now. I've made friends pretty quickly.

I had to reiterate to him more than once after this that there is no chance i'm reciprocating the feelings at all.\n\nHe'd send me gifts every single day. He even got me a pricey ring and bag at one point. I told him this made me uncomfy and he said okay, he'd stop.\n\nI also noticed he started to follow me around. If i went out to talk to friends from other teams, he'd be beside me even if he didn't know them. One day one of my closer coworkers let me know that Gray would ask her what my plans for the day were, and if i had any he'd ask where i'd be going and who i'd be with.

In his mind he might be trying to win you over, but he has lost the plot and is going against the grain here. He makes you uncomfortable, so that is all he should know because making someone uncomfortable means back off! Sending you these gifts is ridiculous! Most of all, you need to report him to HR, pronto!!", "NTA You need to get into HR asap. This isn't normal behavior", "IT IS CREEPY AND STALKERISH IF YOU HAVE TOLD HIM REPEATEDLY TO STOP!!!!! HE HAS DECIDED TO CONTINUE TO PURSUE YOU KNOWING THAT YOU WILL NEVER RECIPROCATE HIS FEELINGS AND THAT HE MAKES YOU UNCOMFORTABLE. REPORT THIS NOW, REPORT IT TO THE POLICE. DOCUMENT EVERYTHING. This is how women die. Protect yourself. If HR doesn\u2019t take you seriously, look up women who were killed because they rejected someone and show them it. Tell them you are scared and that he is not listening when you say no. He is following you and trying to get you in/on his vehicle and at that point could take you anywhere. Tell them next time you feel unsafe because he is following you, that you will call the police. DO NOT FEEL BAD FOR HIM. If anyone tells you that you\u2019re overreacting again, tell them you are not. He has actively searched for your personal information and is so obsessed he remembered it off the top of his head!! That\u2019s terrifying. Research how to get a restraining order, not sure about the requirements. He is a danger to you and any other woman he sets his sights on. Again, he could kill you or assault you. You have no idea who this man really is behind closed doors, just like those other women had no idea that saying no would get them murdered. You need to make sure you\u2019re aware when you\u2019re at home too since he knows your address now. If he EVER shows up call the police on him IMMEDIATELY. Sorry I\u2019m mentioning murder so much, just it\u2019s very important that you get away or get some protection from this man and I\u2019m also sorry for the wall of text. You cannot be too cautious these days.

I mean think about it, if you were to see a coworkers address accidentally you probably wouldn\u2019t think twice about it and you definitely wouldn\u2019t sit there and memorize the address. This dude is insanely creepy and is 100% stalking and harassing you. Go to HR immediately and honestly I\u2019d consider filing a police report too.", "I think there\u2019s a tendency for people to either want to believe a victim caused the issue or the perpetrator is just misunderstood or harmless. Those people are not very smart", "Stalkers are very good at manipulation. You need to make sure that your side is out there because he will spin this as you being mean to him for no reason to turn your other coworkers against you. It is already working because they are dismissing this as not a big problem. You need to make them aware that this is a major and dangerous problem and that you need their support not their dismissal.\n\nIf you don't have one already get a ring camera. You can then document him coming and going from your house or him driving by. Take self defense and really focus on protecting yourself. Make your family aware by providing descriptions of him and his vehicles. Have them document any interactions he makes with them, whether it is online or in person. Make as many people aware of what is happening as possible. Stalkers like to keep their victims isolated so that they feel they have no support. You should proactively start building that wall of support BEFORE he has the chance to tear it down with gaslighting and lies.\n\nEDIT: Thanks so much for the award.", "Go talk to the cops, too.

Set up a camera/gps into your phone so then he knows where you are, can see and hear everything that you do\n\n6. Go into your private conversations and use them as random advantages\n\n7. Buy illegal things in your name\n\n8. Break into your house and rape you\u2026\n\nThere\u2019s many more that I don\u2019t want to imagine so imma give you a list of things to start:\n\n1. Install cameras everywhere and I say EVERYWHERE in your house. Also install little audio recording things in the most random things in the house. (That might save you somehow we never know)\n\n2. Bring at least two audio recordings things with you everywhere you go. (Maybe in your purse or your jacket or things like that)\n\n3.

Unfortunately you might have to move as well, I'm sorry about that, but it's for your own safety. Put a security system in your home. It doesn't have to be fancy, a ring doorbell and I think amazon security have home sensors that connect to your phone? I don't know what country you live in and what the laws on pepper sprays are, but I think all countries allow dog pepper sprays which work on humans as well, so buy a few and have one in your pocked and some in easily accessible places throughout your home. Or a personal alarm, they're really cheap and make this incredibly loud noise which is meant to startle an attacker so you can RUN.\n\nSorry for the long comment, but this is all I've learned from movies and from my job about keeping yourself as safe as possible.\n\n\nEdit to add: if you're walking alone at night, call a friend or family member and stay on the phone until you are home and have checked that everything inside is in order.", "Part of it is that it's a really scary thought that bad things can just happen to you for no reason. People don't want to admit that because then it could happen to them, too.", "It really is creepy that he knew that.", "**A** story?\n\nr/WhenWomenRefuse", "Came here to suggest this too! Get an order of protection if you can", "Report him to HR, stay away from him and do NOT divulge any of your plans to him or anybody else.

Grey is a creep and it really seems like he's trying to get you alone. Don't apologize, don't let him get you alone in a room, and talk to HR. Immediately", "NTA, and THIS MAN IS A STALKER.", "NTA. This should have been brought to HR yesterday.  He's already crossed into creepy stalker territory. Start gathering whatever evidence you can and dont be alone with him.", "NTA- this man is escalating and you owe him nothing.", "Wait you have let this go on for how long? Should have been dealt with months ago.", "He is a STALKER. Everything you just described is stalker things. How the heck does someone knows your adress with out telling them and never been to your house??? A STALKER! Please tell HR this is not normal! NTA", "NTA.  Report him to HR.  Your life is worth too much to bet on whether or not this guy will escalate his already-deeply-inappropriate-&-concerning behavior.  Update us update on how it goes.", "Hellllll naw. Get away from the stalker. Please get help, that is CREEPY as heck. \n\nNTA", "You're doing a great job with not letting him walk with you to your house. Keep it up!! As soon as he gets the chance, he's going to desperately plead to use your bathroom, then refuse to leave. \n\nYou NEED to get security cameras. \n\nNTA but I got chills reading this. Stalker behavior is terrifying and should be taken seriously. I'm sorry you have t o deal with this.", "Damn this is like the prologue of your assault or even homicide. Obviously NTA. Go to HR immediately, if he persists with this behaviour after HR deals with it, I would strongly recommend going to the police. This is legitimate stalker behaviour and can very well escalate very quickly.", "I fucking hate it when they use concern for safety as an excuse.. like, HATE hate.\nNot only are you NTA, this dude is clearly TA and so is your coworker. Go as NC as possible with both. \n\n\nEdited to finish the dang comment.", "Nta be careful, Drop him as a friend, if he contacts you tell him not to contact you again and block. Do not respond if he contacts you again. Keep a trail, just in case you have to  take this to the cops for a protective order.", "This is scary. Too often we are told we are overreacting to stuff like this and then something horrible happens. Report him. ASAP.", "NTA and CALL THE POLICE. He's actively stalking you. Maybe HR will help you, maybe not, but you need to get an official report on file with the authorities to get this guy to leave you alone. Maybe get a restraining order as well. This guy sounds completely out of control.", "NTA\n\nYou have a stalker. Not \"stalkerish\". Stalker. Time to get HR involved and look into legal avenues to protect yourself. I'm sorry both your co-worker and your friend minimized what's happening to you.", "NTA He sounds like a major creep. Glad to see the update that you'll be reporting him", "Yes, this! Go get the harassment filed with HR and go to the police, if only to leave a paper trail. I also agree with what you wrote down this thread on having friends and family logging their interactions with him, but OP should also do it herself. Make a file or folder on your computer where you save a list of interactions (including dates, times and nature of it), and if possible audio or video evidence, screenshots of chats, e-mails and whatnot, pictures of him when you see him drive by outside your house, or any place where you are etc. Ask if your friends will please keep their socials private or at least don't show or tell anything about you when they post.\n\nFurthermore, protect yourself in your house (windows and outside doors with extra locking mechanisms) and have something like a video doorbell, get a car if you don't have one so you won't have to rely on others to go anywhere and where you'renot as exposed. Always have your phone charged and carry something like pepper spray if things escalate and you want to get away from a situation. It shouldn't be necessary, but unfortunately, you're in this situation, and I hope you'll get out of it unharmed.", "Now is the time to go to HR.\n\nAlso, the friend who told you this is just Gray's way of flirting is a *bad friend.*", "He may have a history of behavior that has reached the police.  If not, you will hopefully get a file in case he gets in someone else\u2019s way.  If this is US, something like this could escalate fast.  He\u2019s getting into \u201cincel\u201d territory.  Stay safe", "I'm hoping those 3 people didn't have the whole context because this is seriously scary behaviour. \nYou can't solve all problems by being kind and I'm not surprised you yelled after months of harassment!", "It really has already escalated for OP. For myself, it escalated really quickly as well. We had dated for 8 months before I ended the relationship. Then we were friends for 2 months. The first red flag that he was stalking me was showing up to talk about a food pantry that we both volunteered at, but when I didn\u2019t want to talk, he was following me around. It didn\u2019t seem scary or concerning at the time, but I\u2019m glad that I listened to my gut and left. Since then, I have seen him actively following me/ being around me when he has no reason to be there at least 3 times. Each time it gets scarier because those are just the times that I catch him. I don\u2019t know all the times that I do not see him.", "This dude has crossed way over the line.   Document document document all interactions wwith this guy.   Keep a detailed paper trail in your private accounts.      \nPlease read \u201cThe Gift of Fear\u201d by Gavin de Becker.  All indications suggest this guy will escalate into very dangerous territory.  This book explains how people like this will continue to badger you over and over to get the response they are looking for.  \n\nYou need to go to HR tomorrow with a formal complaint and have it put into writing.\n\nIf he continues to escalate consider contacting the police for an order of protection if your company refuses to do anything.  Be safe.", "Nta. Your coworker sounds like a creepy stalker. I would tell hr, file the complaint and do whatever you can to be and feel safe. This person has taken things wayyy too far. Protect yourself and do what\u2019s best for you.", "You should report it to HR. And for anyone else reading this, If HR is aware of harassment going on and they do nothing, they can be liable. It doesn't have to come from the specific person being harassed", "NTA. Go to HR and file a police report and carry a taser bc that man is trying to make you a lifetime movie.", "OP, I'm going need you to take a breath and hear this: \" You are being stalked.\" \nReport this behavior. Take notes with dates and times. \nTake precautions. \nGet an alarm system. \nGet an apple tag and give the location to a trust friend/family member just in case. \nHis behavior is inappropriate, and the fact he has your address is beyond creepy.", "I had something similar happen, just please make sure your always keep doors and windows locked. I hope you have cameras at home as well. This needs to go through HR as well because this can get dangerous very fast since he feels entitled to know where you live, stalking you and everyone close to you. I would call the police station and tell them what is going on just in case anything is to happen. People like this can get delusional and in their minds they think you are theirs and with rejection to that they can sometimes take it too far. Please stay safe", "Scary levels of stalking.... im so glad you are getting HR involved OP. This behavior can be serious very quickly, a camera outside and motion lights might be a good idea. \n\nI have dealt with a serious stalker and it to this day makes me nervous to be home alone. I often check for red trucks subconsciously. Even years later the stalker would message me. Be careful and don't be embarrassed or feel like the bad guy for \"overreacting\". Stalkers do insane things when they build up enough delusional desperation. \n\nConsider thick wooden dowels or pvc pipes in your window sill (inside the plastic area) to make the windows stay SHUT as some locks are easily jostled open. \n\nTell people you trust and don't bother with guilt or worry that you overreacted seriously. He knew your address by heart and followed you home. There is zero chance he hasn't Dat outside your home. I don't want to upset you, OP, just a hearty personal warning from experience. \n\nWell wishes that you will have peace & peace of mind soon. So very NTA!", "NTA you're in danger", "This is beyond concerning; you need to take this more seriously.\n\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna55413\n\nNTA", "This guy is actually stalking you, it is okay to treat him as a stalker. This is honestly terrifying. I would not stop at HR, this is worth making a police report. Do you have anyone who you could stay with for a time? If you have a car you drive to and from work, it might be worth getting it checked for trackers. I'm sure there are a number of other ways he could have gotten your address, but I recommend this step before the next: it might be a good idea to move, or at least stay at someone else's place for a while.\nNTA for seeing a duck when it walks like a duck and quacks like an obsessed stalker.", "NTA report him to HR immediately so he doesn\u2019t try to report you first", "You are 100% right. He is harassing you", "Nta glad to hear you\u2019re going to be reporting him this is disturbing.", "It's sad how many times I've had to let people know about this.  Please read *The Gift of Fear* by Gavin de Becker.  He outlines many strategies on how to keep oneself safe. Your coworker has already crossed into dangerous territory.  ***He is refusing to hear and accept your no.***  He is insisting that his wants and desires should supercede yours.  Be wary.  You may need to set up safe words with your other coworkers or bosses, or implement other preventative and safety measures.
