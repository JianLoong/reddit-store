Let's call him Gray. It may not be something too deep so I was flattered. i let him know i wasn't interested since i just got out of a long relationship.\n\nA month after this rejection Gray asked me to be his girlfriend. Again, i rejected. He said it's cool, but he'd appreciate it if i didn't cut him off. I didn't, as he was a nice friend to have. I had to reiterate to him more than once after this that there is no chance i'm reciprocating the feelings at all.\n\nOne day one of my closer coworkers let me know that Gray would ask her what my plans for the day were, and if i had any he'd ask where i'd be going and who i'd be with. He'd also ask her if i was hanging around any other male coworkers.\n\nOne time when we were out for a lunch with the team, our boss gave us the rest of the day off. that meant we'd be free to go home or hang out after lunch. I told everyone i'd be off home as i was too tired. He offered to bring me home and i declined. He snapped and started almost begging to bring me home but i just kept declining. He then said fine let me book you a taxi home and proceeded to type my address correctly when i know for a fact i never gave him my address. I was majorly uncomfortable at this point.\n\nHe's done weirder things over the past year - stalking my family on social media, memorizing usernames of my close friends on ig, he even found an old twt acc i wasn't using anymore, ship products he bought online directly to my address, even got on a taxi and followed mine home. When i confronted him about it he said he just wanted to make sure i was safe.\n\nLast week while preparing to go home it started to rain so he insisted to bring me home on his motorcycle. he followed me around the office just going \"please let me bring you home\". we were around other coworkers but i snapped at him and told him to f off and leave me alone in a rather high voice. a coworker (who was aware of the stories i told above) overheard and told me i didn't have to react that way. i talked to a (non coworker) friend about it and he told me this might be gray's way of \"winning me over\". now i'm worried that i'm just viewing him as annoying and stalker-ish bc i didn't reciprocate the feelings and went off on him when he was being kind.

They obviously don't understand/care about your situation if they know the stories and expect you to always be calm. Majorly pissed at that scene extra.\n\nAnyways, report him.

Right now he is in the fantasy stage where he is delusional enough to believe that you two are meant to be if he can just convince you of it. \n\nOnce he moves out of that, which it sounds like he is moving into obsession, he will begin to get angry. Anger is going to lead to increased stalking and more packages (it will be come a war of attrition).

So, I ended a 7 year relationship a little over a year ago. This was around the same time i got into the job i have now. I've made friends pretty quickly.

I had to reiterate to him more than once after this that there is no chance i'm reciprocating the feelings at all.\n\nHe'd send me gifts every single day. He even got me a pricey ring and bag at one point. I told him this made me uncomfy and he said okay, he'd stop.\n\nI also noticed he started to follow me around. If i went out to talk to friends from other teams, he'd be beside me even if he didn't know them. One day one of my closer coworkers let me know that Gray would ask her what my plans for the day were, and if i had any he'd ask where i'd be going and who i'd be with.

In his mind he might be trying to win you over, but he has lost the plot and is going against the grain here. He makes you uncomfortable, so that is all he should know because making someone uncomfortable means back off! Sending you these gifts is ridiculous! Most of all, you need to report him to HR, pronto!!", "NTA You need to get into HR asap. This isn't normal behavior", "IT IS CREEPY AND STALKERISH IF YOU HAVE TOLD HIM REPEATEDLY TO STOP!!!!! HE HAS DECIDED TO CONTINUE TO PURSUE YOU KNOWING THAT YOU WILL NEVER RECIPROCATE HIS FEELINGS AND THAT HE MAKES YOU UNCOMFORTABLE. REPORT THIS NOW, REPORT IT TO THE POLICE. DOCUMENT EVERYTHING. This is how women die. Protect yourself. If HR doesn\u2019t take you seriously, look up women who were killed because they rejected someone and show them it. Tell them you are scared and that he is not listening when you say no. He is following you and trying to get you in/on his vehicle and at that point could take you anywhere. Tell them next time you feel unsafe because he is following you, that you will call the police. DO NOT FEEL BAD FOR HIM. If anyone tells you that you\u2019re overreacting again, tell them you are not. He has actively searched for your personal information and is so obsessed he remembered it off the top of his head!! That\u2019s terrifying. Research how to get a restraining order, not sure about the requirements. He is a danger to you and any other woman he sets his sights on. Again, he could kill you or assault you. You have no idea who this man really is behind closed doors, just like those other women had no idea that saying no would get them murdered. You need to make sure you\u2019re aware when you\u2019re at home too since he knows your address now. If he EVER shows up call the police on him IMMEDIATELY. Sorry I\u2019m mentioning murder so much, just it\u2019s very important that you get away or get some protection from this man and I\u2019m also sorry for the wall of text. You cannot be too cautious these days.

I mean think about it, if you were to see a coworkers address accidentally you probably wouldn\u2019t think twice about it and you definitely wouldn\u2019t sit there and memorize the address. This dude is insanely creepy and is 100% stalking and harassing you. Go to HR immediately and honestly I\u2019d consider filing a police report too.", "I think there\u2019s a tendency for people to either want to believe a victim caused the issue or the perpetrator is just misunderstood or harmless. Those people are not very smart", "Stalkers are very good at manipulation. You need to make sure that your side is out there because he will spin this as you being mean to him for no reason to turn your other coworkers against you. It is already working because they are dismissing this as not a big problem. You need to make them aware that this is a major and dangerous problem and that you need their support not their dismissal.\n\nIf you don't have one already get a ring camera. You can then document him coming and going from your house or him driving by. Take self defense and really focus on protecting yourself. Make your family aware by providing descriptions of him and his vehicles. Have them document any interactions he makes with them, whether it is online or in person. Make as many people aware of what is happening as possible. Stalkers like to keep their victims isolated so that they feel they have no support. You should proactively start building that wall of support BEFORE he has the chance to tear it down with gaslighting and lies.\n\nEDIT: Thanks so much for the award.", "Go talk to the cops, too.

Set up a camera/gps into your phone so then he knows where you are, can see and hear everything that you do\n\n6. Go into your private conversations and use them as random advantages\n\n7. Buy illegal things in your name\n\n8. Break into your house and rape you\u2026\n\nThere\u2019s many more that I don\u2019t want to imagine so imma give you a list of things to start:\n\n1. Install cameras everywhere and I say EVERYWHERE in your house. Also install little audio recording things in the most random things in the house. (That might save you somehow we never know)\n\n2. Bring at least two audio recordings things with you everywhere you go. (Maybe in your purse or your jacket or things like that)\n\n3.

Whenever someone is asking for a friend request, make sure that you know them, that you feel safe and comfortable around them/having them seeing your pictures, that they confirm that it\u2019s their account when you ask them. If they start doing anything weird on that account, block them immediately.\n\n6. Create at least a second bank account/saving account that has the exact same amount of money as the original one. Like this if he steals all the money in one, you still have the other. \n\n7. Audio record literally EVERY TIME you and someone are talking about him or you and him are talking. \n\n8. Buy one of these alert little things that every time your in danger, you pull it, press it and it makes such a loud noise that everyone realizes that someone is in danger.\n\n9. Always let family/friends see your location. It might sound weird or dangerous but if you go missing, that way they\u2019ll know where you are.\n\n10. If you date someone, make sure to warn them about him, and never let anybody know about this relationship. Even the closest friends and/or family.\n\n11. Gather all the proofs that he\u2019s stalking you, report him to the police and charge him.\n\n12.
