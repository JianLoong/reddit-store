I have lots of food allergies but realized in a weird way that one was responsible for my psoriasis. You are not me, whatever is triggering this may be absolutely different. But on the off chance I want to tell you because it's a very difficult thing to discover, I did on accident. The same time the psoriasis showed up I had terrible ibs. I did a food diet and found out corn (in fucking everything, so no wonder I was sick daily) was responsible. So I no longer had stomach pains as long as I avoided corn BUT the psoriasis seemed there to stay.\n\nAbout 10 years later, after I already had a child in the interim who developed baby eczema, my new doctor diagnosed me with asthma. Somehow it went unnoticed all these years, I didn't believe her and she scolded me for not taking it seriously, so I did. I did another food diet to see if anything triggered it. It turned out that wheat/gluten did, so I stopped eating that alongside corn. \n\nHere's the thing, I had read that wheat/gluten could trigger skin issues and tried giving it up for a month before. Nothing seemed to change, so why bother with something (at least then) that was expensive and difficult.  But I gave it up for good for asthma. Over the course of maybe 9 months slowly, slowly the psoriasis went away. I was shocked. As I started noticing, after a few months, I would ask my husband, am I crazy or is this getting better. It is completely gone now, never came back. I was so excited about this accidental discovery I immediately took it out of my kid's diet - her eczema vanished too, but again it was over time. It seems to take so long to leave the body that most people (including me) would not try such a difficult thing for so long to see if that was the problem. \n\nMy kid is now 10, eczema free most her life and gluten free. No other allergies, thankfully she eats corn just fine. Her allergist recently had her tested for the genetic coeliac marker and she, unsurprisingly,  has it. She says I likely do as well so I will be tested. I had a doctor test me with the regular gluten test but it was negative,  I only later learned if you are gluten free that test is not accurate. \n\nSorry for the long winded comment but if this helps you or anyone reading it, just in case, I had to post. I'm like a crazy person who found religion. Like you I was ashamed and hid my body, not to mention the discomfort. I will say, now that I'm older, I wish I could tell 20 something me to tell everyone to fuck right off and revel in my body, psoriasis and all. I wish you all the best.", "NTA.

I was explaining to my boys how we weren't going to go because of the funeral. 5 looks at 7 and says \"Why? He's already dead!\"\n\nThen at the cemetery 5 wanted to know how the coffin got into the ground. He's very interested in all things mechanical so I explained how it worked. After our preacher finished up, 5 looked at the funeral director and said \"Are you going to drop him now?\"", "And the vast majority have probably tried multiple weight loss plans without success. One of mine had tried at least 20 plans just in the time we knew each other. She even tried a doctor-monitored diet (which, it turned out, the doctor actually knew nothing about the diet and how to monitor it, and she ended up in the hospital). She finally saw a bariatric physician (they specializes in morbid obesity) who ran so many tests I couldn\u2019t believe it! He concluded that she was one of the few people who was genetically obese, which is why she couldn\u2019t lose weight.

I also had questions when I was wearing braces, such as the following:\n\n\u201cWhat are those casts on your legs?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy do you walk funny?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy do you walk like that?\u201d\n\nI had one elementary-school-aged kid when I was in middle school come up to me and tell her that her mom saw me in the local mall, and that her mom told her to not say anything about me. My impression was that the mom said it entirely unprovoked.\n\n\u201cCan you sign?\u201d To put it politely, that asshole saw that I was holding a debit card and could of course hold a pen. Not everybody with Cerebral Palsy is confined to a wheelchair or without inability to hold anything. \n\nI\u2019ve had people whom have treated me like I have an intellectual or learning disability because I use a rollator.\n\nWhen one of my professors at my community college saw that I had fallen, she just walked right by me."]}
