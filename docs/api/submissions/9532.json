I have lots of food allergies but realized in a weird way that one was responsible for my psoriasis. You are not me, whatever is triggering this may be absolutely different. But on the off chance I want to tell you because it's a very difficult thing to discover, I did on accident. The same time the psoriasis showed up I had terrible ibs. I did a food diet and found out corn (in fucking everything, so no wonder I was sick daily) was responsible. So I no longer had stomach pains as long as I avoided corn BUT the psoriasis seemed there to stay.\n\nAbout 10 years later, after I already had a child in the interim who developed baby eczema, my new doctor diagnosed me with asthma. Somehow it went unnoticed all these years, I didn't believe her and she scolded me for not taking it seriously, so I did. I did another food diet to see if anything triggered it. It turned out that wheat/gluten did, so I stopped eating that alongside corn. \n\nHere's the thing, I had read that wheat/gluten could trigger skin issues and tried giving it up for a month before. Nothing seemed to change, so why bother with something (at least then) that was expensive and difficult.  But I gave it up for good for asthma. Over the course of maybe 9 months slowly, slowly the psoriasis went away. I was shocked. As I started noticing, after a few months, I would ask my husband, am I crazy or is this getting better. It is completely gone now, never came back. I was so excited about this accidental discovery I immediately took it out of my kid's diet - her eczema vanished too, but again it was over time. It seems to take so long to leave the body that most people (including me) would not try such a difficult thing for so long to see if that was the problem. \n\nMy kid is now 10, eczema free most her life and gluten free. No other allergies, thankfully she eats corn just fine. Her allergist recently had her tested for the genetic coeliac marker and she, unsurprisingly,  has it. She says I likely do as well so I will be tested. I had a doctor test me with the regular gluten test but it was negative,  I only later learned if you are gluten free that test is not accurate. \n\nSorry for the long winded comment but if this helps you or anyone reading it, just in case, I had to post. I'm like a crazy person who found religion. Like you I was ashamed and hid my body, not to mention the discomfort. I will say, now that I'm older, I wish I could tell 20 something me to tell everyone to fuck right off and revel in my body, psoriasis and all. I wish you all the best.", "NTA.

Not a fun disease to deal with, that's for sure.", "Info:  So was your psoriasis actively open/bleeding?", "Ok, withholding judgement until getting clarity in the severity. Were you actively bleeding or weeping pus? Or was it already scabbed?\n\nI might be an asshole but I completely understand not wanting bodily fluid of (to other guests) unknown cause potentially contaminating any areas.

She eventually worked out that her symptoms were due to tomatoes.\n\nMy son developed Coeliacs - he placed himself on an exclusion diet and his symptoms cleared up. He however was reluctant to suffer from the side effects of eating gluten and when he had his biopsy he was told that his villae were strongly reactive despite the lack of gluten in his diet. Further testing showed that he also reacts strongly to other grain proteins as well as gluten. He reacts to barley malt, gluten-free wheat, oats, and even has had a reaction to distilled clear spirits (a Vodka) due to slight traces remaining in the alcohol.\n\nAnd yes it CAN affect the skin.
