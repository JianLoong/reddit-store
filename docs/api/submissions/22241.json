Have you reported a noise complaint to your landlord ? Have you mentioned the destruction of property? \nYou could have someone perform a wellness check when she starts back up with the banging and screaming.  \nThe fact that she believes you are plotting to kill her boyfriend is concerning...\nI can only speak from limited experience, but please watch out. Keep your doors and windows locked and avoid her.\nMy neighbor isn't the greatest at picking partners. She found herself dating a meth addict and their relationship ended with a police manhunt in the woods at the back of my house. He had taken her hostage with a kitchen knife. Meth is no joke. Yes, she's ill, and I'm sure you don't want her homeless. But you don't have to live beneath someone that disrupts your peace and possibly your safety.", "NTA. This woman sounds like she could become dangerous at some point so why should you live in fear and possibly get assaulted because of someone's drug problem? How do you know she won't start hammering holes in YOU one day? Meth heads are definitely prone to violence. Report her to the landlord. I can't imagine he'll be happy about his property being destroyed. Let him handle it.", "You're n t a for wanting to feel safe in your home, but YTA for wanting to get her kicked out of low income housing because it's very likely she's going to end up homeless. You could reach out to a local mental health crisis organization, or even have the police do some kind of wellness check. Not that I advocate calling the police a ton, but it might be semi-fair in the situation since she is making false reports.  Or even talk to the landlord to see if she has a case manager or family members that can help intervene. At least as a first step before jumping to \"ok let's get her evicted\".", "What exactly did you expect in a low income apartment?", "What exactly did you expect in a low income apartment?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Honestly the fact she is doing meth is the part that scares me. The place I live is \"housing first Mental health second.\" So it's why she is still here. Plus they stay they can't force people to seek mental health/addiction treatment even if they wanted too. I worry about her health and other people's health here. Many people have relapsed and it breaks my heart. I'm lucky where the only \"drug\" I've had is weed so I'm still new to this environment so to speak?", "Very true. Meth can very well cause a psychotic break, it happens and is scary and completely unpredictable.  I\u2019d call the police when she does this because it could be perceived as a threat", "Once she murders OP, she'll have her housing needs taken care of for quite some time.", "Ok?? How does your comment tell me if I'm the asshole or not? What were you expecting out of saying that?", "Move out, kid, the next one won't be better.", "I would if I could. I'm not in a financial position to do so ATM. But I am getting an education to hopefully move out and find a good job. But thank you for the advice. :)", "Did you read the title?", "I am sorry about your current situation, but your neighbor surely is in a bad situation too, be a little more patient.", "Yes, but I am the neighbors age, maybe I just feel bad for her.", "Once OP has been murdered, she'll find it easier to be patient. For now I imagine she finds it very difficult.", "Age isn't the crux.  OP lives in low income housing while they are in school.  It's not like you can just move out of low income.  OP is at where they can afford, not by choice.  And there are still rules in low income housing."]}
