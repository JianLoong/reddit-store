I love my job, I love my coworkers, but I can\u2019t stand my boss. She has been recently demoted from her role and no longer manages anyone but me and one other person in our office. I don\u2019t know why this happened, but I could probably speculate based on her behavior. \n\nShe scheduled a mystery meeting with me for next week, with no context. I asked for clarification, she told me she would \u201ctalk to me about it in our 1-on-1 meeting\u201d and wouldn\u2019t give any further insight. I go into this meeting flustered and confused. \n\nShe immediately tells me that she has heard from my coworkers that I have been bossy to another coworker of mine. She clarified multiple times the coworker WAS NOT the one that said it. I ask for examples but she says she can\u2019t provide any feedback because she hasn\u2019t seen it herself, she\u2019s only heard about it. I called her on the carpet for encouraging gossip conversations about me. She provides no other helpful feedback on this topic. I am lost and wondering what the point of her bringing this to my attention was. She also admits in the meeting that she has not received any negative feedback about my actual job performance \n\nShe follows this meeting up today by sending an email telling me she wants me to continue to grow and that conversations about me with my colleagues are necessary, so that she can accurately evaluate me. While I generally agree with this, her delivery is terrible. \n\nI told her that moving forward we should include a third party in these conversations because I feel like they\u2019re going no where productive. Am I overreacting? I\u2019ve Never worked in a management role, so I don\u2019t know what is appropriate, but it doesn\u2019t feel like this is. \n\nP.S. the mystery meeting was to \u201cspend quality time together\u201d so I\u2019m not sure why she couldn\u2019t have explained that from the start", "created_utc": 1683232823, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/137z9m0/aita_for_telling_my_boss_that_i_will_no_longer/", "score": 113, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If so, I\u2019d address this with them. Also, did she respond to your email about including a third party?", "NTA - if she thinks you're demeaning your co-workers there needs to be proof of this on record. Asking a third party to be present protects you against her using gossip to justify her opinion of your job performance.  Also, her being recently demoted makes it seems like she is just grasping at straws to show someone higher up that she handled a workplace incident that may never have existed.", "NTA. Your boss pulled you into a meeting and wasted your time to ask about office gossip? This woman has too much free time on her hands. I can see why she got demoted.", "NTA. In a situation like this, when it's regarding you're supposed treatment of another co-worker than HR needs to be involved. Not just her. Especially since she's surely from being demoted apparently.", "If you were part of a union, the third party would be a shop steward. Unions have this position for a reason. I'd say NTA and I think it's a smart request.", "You\u2019re not overreacting if you feel her delivery is poor and does not lead to fair evaluation of your performance or effective points for improvement. Sounds like she\u2019s just not a great manager. NTA.", "NTA - there may be a more practical solution, but this isn't a bad one. I'm not sure what your company is like but if this person continues to give you a hard time it may be worth contacting HR/another manager in your department and explaining that you are having a lot of difficulty having a positive working relationship with this person and asking if there is anything they can do to help.\n\nIf they REALLY give you a hard time about anything, just make sure to document whatever you can.", "I dont get it.  Your boss pulls you into a meeting to give you a heads up there might be complaints about you before it heads to HR?\n\nYou want it to hit HR first before you find out?", "NTA- I would likely have made the same decision. If you have the option to insist on a 3rd person in the meeting, do it. If she is going to be on the up and up, it should not be a problem for her.", "NTA and this makes me uncomfortable.  i can see why you requested a third party.  i just hope it doesn't turn into two people ganging up on you.  i mean, is she trying to see if you're a good fit personality wise with the company?  because it isn't about your job performance.  was the meeting a warning?  how are you supposed to grow if you don't know what you did wrong?  it just feels.....icky.  watch your step.", "NTA. Who in their right mind calls a meeting with someone they work with to spend quality time together??? That would creep me out bigtime in any job. She sounds like trouble and sounds like someone you'd want to have a third party involved in for future meetings.", "Always respond in an email, brief recap of the convo and then state something like 'so clearly, going forward we agree to blah blah blah' or the like. Always make sure you get an email response back, keep the convos in a chain and keep ahard copy and a backup stored password protected. That way you don't need to add a person.... someone that might not be neutral. \nAnd seriously, quality time with this dingbat? NTA and good luck", "This is why I hate hate hate hate working for small companies. This is the kind of thing where you need an HR department.", "No, you're not overreacting.  She's flying some pretty big red flags.  I would suggest that the next meeting be held in HR... NTAH.", "NTA This all sounds like she's trying to manage someone just for the sake of having someone to manage. You could say she's creating problems for herself to solve. I see why she was demoted.", "NTA. If she was demoted then there is someone above her. I would speak to them and let them deal with her.", "NTA.  Next meeting set your phone on the table and hit record and start by stating her name and that you will be recording this meeting for you to review later and for the record.  When she melts down ask to speak to her supervisor.", "I don't really see this as an asshole situation.  I'm not even sure what to make the verdict.  NAH ?  Because there is no conflict?\n\nIf you are asking for advice - I could give you some;  based on what you are saying... I do not think this is the right approach:\n\n> I told her that moving forward we should include a third party in these conversations because I feel like they\u2019re going no where productive. \n\nI've spent 15 years in management, 10 years managing managers - and I've never heard/seen a request like this.  I don't want to say it's ... unprofessional?  It just doesn't seem normal.\n\nIf you feel like things with your boss are bad - you should:\n\n1.  Discuss it with HR.\n\n2.  Depending on the org structure, try to discuss your concern's with your boss's boss.  \n\nI don't think asking for a third party (unless it was HR or your Boss's boss) really helps here.", "Did your boss react poorly to this request?\n\nThere is zero conflict here.", "Hm, I think I'll get flamed for this, but I'm going to go YTA. It's not clear from your write-up that your boss has actually done anything inappropriate, despite your accusation of her encouraging gossip. She has an obligation to monitor and act on complaints that she is receiving about you, and to let you know of things that are bothering the people you work with so that you can be more aware of that behavior and adjust. You reacted very defensively. It's too bad she wasn't more prepared to provide details of what others were reporting, but she is correct that her (private) conversations with your peers is appropriate for collecting feedback about you that allow her to be aware of your service to others and general performance; if that's really what you were talking about in 'calling her to the carpet' about gossip, you were quite insubordinate.\n\nYou should have someone else present if you feel uncomfortable with the way your boss is treating you or if you are suspicious of her intentions, but again the mention of meetings not being productive without a third party present speaks not really to your comfort per se but to your judgment that she's an ineffective manager, and it comes across as very passive-aggressive.\n\nIf you have real proof that she's a bad manager, take it to HR or to her manager.", "NAH because I'm kind of having a hard time determining what the conflict is here?", "NTA from what you've said, but this woman has ulterior motives here that make me nervous.   Only discuss the work and nothing else.    Do not discuss personalities. or go to her boss.", "This is common at work. Either you are being coached which is a good thing or you are being manhandled by a bitter boss that is on her way down or out. It\u2019s honestly hard to say for sure but look back at your prior interactions with folks. You handled it right by asking for specifics. You faltered  a bit asking for third party present and persisting.  Take time to reflect. See if there is anything you can improve that will be a better reflection of your intention.  Connect with coworkers on how things are going.  Build relationships so your boss doesn\u2019t have the only say in your career \n\nAlso know that often women are labeled bossy even if they say and do exactly the same thing a man would in that interaction. This makes it that much harder to really understand what this is \n\nOverall NTA", "YTA because your reaction to your manager\n\nYour manager has given you an informal chat/warning about your workplace behavior.\n\nI can almost guarantee that you didn't need to tell her that you want a third party present if she wants a meeting about behavior again because I can almost guarantee that she is going to have someone there as a witness when she fires you.\n\nYour manager was trying to give you a heads up, and it sounds like you're displaying to her exactly the type of behavior that she was given information about.\n\nYou don't say how old you are, but I get the feeling you're young and not that long in full time employment in office jobs.  It seems you have some learning to do.", "If you can't get along with your boss, either quit or expect to be fired.\n\nTelling your boss you will not meet with them 1-on-1 is you volunteering to be fired for cause.\n\nPerception is reality. At least one of your coworkers considers you bossy. Based on your own description of events, that seems accurate.\n\n\"Well, no one complains about my job performance.\" So what? You're good at your job, but you're a bossy AH. Therefore, YTA.\n\nEither find a new job or at least stop being so hard to get along with. Bossing your coworkers around is not good for your job security. Arguing with your boss is even worse.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don\u2019t see your boss \u201callowing\u201d a 3rd neutral party. What a work colleague did with our toxic boss was this- looked up recording in the state we are in- 1 party consent when in person. So they were called into. A \u201cmeeting\u201d and they turned on an app on their phone for voice recording for the meeting (don\u2019t remember, it doesn\u2019t show up and you can lock your phone) and put it on the corner of the desk. Colleague got yelled at, swore at, and berated for things other people did- basically a punching bag. Colleague had a few of these before he got called in for a \u201ccounseling\u201d. (Bonus in that we are union and he informed the union of the shenanigans) he said union rep has to be present. Our boss tried to write him up for 5 different made up things with no documentation. Union shut her down hard. (Didn\u2019t tip about recording) she kept up the harassment and tried again. Union filed a grievance she tried to say it was because they suck at their job. We all had recordings of these meetings she had with all of us. She doubled down, we filed hostile work, we won, we were removed from her responsibility. She kept trying everything to get us all fired. No one told her about the recording and we continued until a rat told. We were at a point that our phone were out and recording all day as she would wonder in and start yelling", "We do not, we\u2019re a very small company. And no she has not responded", "Very very good point. Would have never thought of it that way. Thank you", " \nYou are overcorrecting the notes. A big red flag flies over Mon", "It\u2019s not going to hit HR. She is effectively the HR because we are a small company. She has no examples of me being \u201cbossy\u201d so what is there to report to HR?", "Yeah I have no idea. I highly doubt it would turn into that because my boss is a completely different person around her boss who would be the third party. I get along very very well with everyone in my office aside from her. Even the coworker she\u2019s saying I was bossy too and I get along well. We\u2019re not besties but we chat casually everyday and I really never have a reason to give her direction", "Lol AGREED. She knows nothing about me whatsoever and we\u2019ve worked together in a small office for quite some time. If she ever made our conversations enjoyable, I\u2019m sure we would talk more but I avoid her for a myriad of reasons", "Lol thank you. The good luck is needed.

My Boss\u2019 boss would be the third party I\u2019m referring to", "I appreciate your feedback here and am taking your thoughts into consideration. I do agree that she should take feedback from my coworkers and I respect the need for that. My issue really lies with the delivery. If your intention is to help me, why wouldn\u2019t you come equipped with actual feedback to give or say it in a way that would lead to a resolution? Her basically telling me people are talking to her about me but won\u2019t tell me what to do to help the issue is really making this whole convo pointless. I cannot think of a time when I have been or said anything that would be perceived as bossy, so I\u2019m at a loss wondering what I did wrong", "I\u2019m glad you see it, because so do I. I will do everything I can to make it so that she is no longer my manager", "Yeah I appreciate this feedback. In my opinion I have really strong and good relationships with my coworkers. I enjoy them and we all have a good rapport. She is the only one I struggle with, genuinely. When I first started I had some troubles with the coworker mentioned trying to micromanage me, but we haven\u2019t had any issues in months so I\u2019m genuinely confused where this stems from. Regardless, I will be mindful of how I speak and engage with that coworker in the future", "Sometimes I wonder if people are actually reading the whole post. LOL\n\nMy boss has been demoted. Acting as if she\u2019s on some god tier and I couldn\u2019t ALSO be removed from her management is kind of ridiculous. To know my boss has been demoted and assume I have to automatically respect her every word or get fired is crazy. \n\nI have a good relationship with my coworkers. Im good at my job. We all have flaws and faults as I\u2019m sure you do too. My boss is on a power trip and grasping at straws because she doesn\u2019t have anything to actually criticize me about. So no, I will do neither of those things. I will wait for her to be removed as my manager, which should be happening soon.", "And she\u2019s your only supervisor? \n\nI should of said too that I don\u2019t think your TA either.

Vs., your boss taking it to them, and giving their side of the story first.", "I appreciate your mature response. I understand what you mean about feeling like you're getting negative feedback but it's, maybe not actionable. There is a possibility she didn't feel that she could give more detail without disclosing who said something, that's the only thought that comes to mind that might explain why she wasn't more forthcoming with deets. \n\nAnyway, good luck.", "Yeah, if you're at the point where someone's saying \"I want a third party present at our meetings because I don't trust you\" then the boss/employee relationship has completely broken down to the point where I don't see how you could stay in that job.

It usually doesn't end well for the individual contributor.", "Yes she is :/ I am hopeful that is changing soon", "I think that\u2019s a good thing to have in place for sure. Especially bc the heads up could actually save so many people time and energy. Sadly we don\u2019t have that in place and I truly don\u2019t think I\u2019ve done anything wrong but I will still monitor my responses and interactions with said coworker going forward", "Yes I definitely will.

Seems like the adult thing to do but idk", "I think that person would be by next stop if your boss is up to something weird here or becomes abbot too bossy. Seems like your boss feeds off of having the power of being a \u201cboss\u201d. I\u2019m guessing it also had something to do with her being demoted", "I would have to agree. The untitled mystery meeting is enough to convince me she enjoys having the upper hand", "Absolutely! And the way she is going about everything. Not having specific incidents of what she\u2019s claiming you\u2019ve \u201cdone\u201d, wanting to have regular meetings under the guise of evaluating you, etc. I think I\u2019d try to find out why she was demoted, but that\u2019s just me. But she\u2019s definitely a power hungry type of person", "I do slightly know why she was demoted but not the whole picture. She was treating another coworker of mine very similar and called her a couple of names in a meeting. My coworker asked to be removed from her team and my boss was demoted shortly after. I\u2019m sure there is more to that but that\u2019s a piece of the puzzle"]}
