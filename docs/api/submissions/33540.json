We both work and have no kids. Recently, Lisa\u2019s dog \u201cMango\u201d(our dog now, but Lisa\u2019s had Mango for a decade before we met) needed a surgery that costs about $7,000, which made money pretty tight for us. I ended up taking out a pet care loan for a big portion of the surgery under my name. If we pay it off in a year we won\u2019t have interest, so we made a monthly budget to get it paid off within one year, and we\u2019ve been paying it out of our joint account.\n\nAlso recently, my younger brother Johnny (27M) who has a history of drug addiction and mental health issues reached out to me asking for a $2,000 loan because he needed legal fees for a custody battle with his baby mama. In the last few years whenever he asks for money, everyone in my family refuses because it\u2019s gonna go to drugs, but this last year he\u2019s actually been clean and able to hold down a job. I care about him, and he\u2019s had a really hard childhood compared to the rest of the siblings, so I sorta get why he ended up the way he did and want to help him this time. Johnny said he\u2019d pay me back but I have a rule of never expecting it back when I give money to family (which I rarely do). I decided to take on a bunch of extra shifts at work  during the last month and made enough money to send to him plus have some left over to add towards our monthly pet loan payment.\n\nI told Lisa the plan, thinking she\u2019s be happy we can help Johnny out AND also have some additional funds towards pet loan payments, but she was pissed that I am sending money to John when it all can go towards the loan.\n\nThe way I see it, we already have a monthly budget towards the loan, we can pay it off in time without interest. I know that Mango is ours now but technically that\u2019s my step-dog that I am assuming responsibilities for because I love Lisa. When we found out how much Mango\u2019s surgery will cost, everyone advised us to put her down because she is also very old, but we went ahead with the surgery  without thinking twice because Lisa LOVES Mango, and both of our paychecks are going towards paying off her surgery. Meanwhile, I worked extra hours on my own to help my brother out so he can pay legal fees to be able to see his son. I told Lisa that if she wants to pay off the pet loan earlier than the pre planned schedule, I will take on more shifts at work this month too, but Lisa just seems pissed that I would want to help Johnny at all. I don\u2019t understand why she expects us to not think twice about a $7000 pet bill to save our 14 year old dog, but is upset when I want to send $2000 to my brother so that he can see his child. I went ahead and send Johnny the money, and I'm totally sleeping on the couch now for that but I don't think I did anything that outrageous.

Not for wanting to help your brother.  But you should NOT have given Him the money directly.  You should have paid it directly to his lawyer or whatever organization he's using.  I can see where your wife is leaning towards a bill she KNOWS you both have rather than believe that your brother will be using the money as he states.   You just handed him one hell of a temptation.", "YTA. First, you *never* give an addict money. If you are going to help an addict, your best bet is to pay the debtor or whatever directly.\n\nSecond, that amount of money should have been a conversation between you and your wife *before* agreeing to help your brother. I understand you want to help him, and you love him, but you and your wife are a *team*.", "YTA\n\nHousehold finances have to be agreed upon. You agreed for the pet loan.

It\u2019s nice you helped him but your marriage comes first. sorry", "YTA. You are married with a joint account? Then you absolutely need to be on the same page when it comes to spending. The difference between the \"Mango\"-situation and the situation with your brother is that you both agreed on the surgery for the dog. Your wife does not agree with helping your brother. If you want to be able to make that sort of decision unilaterally, you need to have \"my money\", \"your money\" and \"our money\". \"Our money\" can only be spent on stuff we agree about.", "YTA - should\u2019ve discussed with your wife first before unilaterally making big financial decisions", "NTA\n\nNormally I'd say all significant expenses I need to be approved by both spouses, but since you're planning to work extra shifts to earn the money, this seems like something that you can take responsibility for on your own.\n\nI do question the wisdom of handing an addict $2000 and trusting him to use it wisely", "This all depends on what financial boundaries you've set for your marriage.

The decision to take care of mango was a mutual decision, sending money to an addict wasn\u2019t.

Of course, your wife has no problem with spending $7k on a pet that was hers before you came along. Because, this is in her interest. Your brother is not.

Did your wife have to pick up your slack (cooking, cleaning, etc) since you were working so much more?", "YTA, not for giving your brother money but for not talking to your wife before agreeing and spending a whole month picking up extra shifts to cover it. \n\nI would do anything for my pets and I would also do anything for my sister.

All payments have been kept up with for their dog and all other household responsibilities. He can spend his personal (non joint) money how he sees fit.", "YTA. All financial decisions should be discussed together. You GAVE AWAY$2,000 without discussing it with her because you knew she would be against it. You deliberately did it behind her back.", "Nta if the 2000 came from a personal account and not the joint account. I'm glad that your brother is turning his life around and I hope he uses the 2k for what he said he would.", "YTA giving money directly to a known addict who has done this before by your own admission without even discussing with your wife first is WILD.

A compromise is at least sending it direct to the agency. Unilateral decisions just breed resentment.

But you both agreed to it.", "YTA. Your brother hasn't changed that much. He's still a selfish leech. He should be standing on his own feet now, not hitting everyone else up for money again and again. By denying your wife a say in a major financial decision you showed her that her opinion means nothing to you and you're selfish. You're supposed to be partners. This affects her too.", "What\u2019s with all the Y T A? Even though you keep a joint account, since you took full responsibility, made a plan and worked for it, obviously NTA here and your wife sounds a bit selfish. It\u2019s okay to pay $7k for emergency care for her dog but not okay to make a plan for 2k for your literal brother, especially as this could help encourage him to stay on the straight and narrow? \n\nNTA at all. Obviously sending it when your wife said no isn\u2019t cool, but I would have done the same since she\u2019d dug in her heels and wouldn\u2019t listen to reason.", "NTA wife is wrong to be pissy! \nLet\u2019s be realistic you agreed to help cover the cost of a 7k surgery for an elderly dog that will perhaps prolong its life for another 2 years? I understand that the elderly dog is a part of the family, but this is an extremely expensive procedure. You decided to support the wife in this situation, and have chosen to work extra hours to accumulate the necessary funds to meet the dog\u2019s medical expenses and to help your brother. A brother that is getting back on his feet and fighting for access to his child (your niece or nephew). You didn\u2019t ask the wife to work extra hours so she needs to understand that your family and financial decisions need her support too just like you did with the elderly dog. She seems very selfish in this situation\u2026 NTA", "NTA\u2026. And to add to the discussion, I wonder if every time you partner doesn\u2019t agree with something and you both don\u2019t do it, probably you will ended up paying for all the dreams and you get nothing. \n\nI think is very noble to help you brother that is trying to get back on his feet. I hope he gets his life back. Also hope your partner becomes more compassionate.", "YTA", "YTA. Mango is part of the household. Your brother is not. You don\u2019t just hand addicts large sums of money. Many overdose stories start that way.", "Without consideration for anything else, I would be p\\*ssed if my partner sent money to someone who has a history of using loaned money for drugs. \n\nAnd... speaking as a single mom...

Stop and listen to your wife. What a person with an addiction DOES NOT need is money. You are ENABLING him. Your brother has a disease no amount of money is going to help.

If it was her money or part her money I would understand speaking to her first.", "Just because they have a joint account doesn\u2019t mean op can\u2019t spend the EXTRA money HE earned with the express purpose of helping his brother AND he even added extra into the account. She has no right to be mad", "She doesn't know about it. \ud83e\udd2b", "I can concede on that point as well. Telling his wife why he was picking up those shifts could have helped the situation. \n\nI just feel his wife could be more understanding here even if OP wasn\u2019t perfect with the execution of his plan. He is working hard to help pay for her dog\u2019s bills even though the dog does not have long left, because he sees how much the dog means to his wife. \n\nI feel the wife should apply a similar sentiment when viewing OP and his literal brother. \n\nOP wasn\u2019t blameless, but the wife is being rather calloused.", "He took on extra shifts, he informed her of his intentions before doing anything, what is the problem with his communication?\n\nThe only thing that should have been done differently is putting the dog down.", "What could have made their lives easier is not taking out a $7000 debt on a half dead pet. His side hustle to help his brother is none of her business.", "No kids, no real impact, GTFO. It just impacted his free him.", "What are you even trying to say?", "This is an out of pocket response, but I guess it makes sense coming from a person who was upset someone with special needs got more attention than her. Do better.", "You're a clown. Man works his ass off to help his brother and a dying dog and she's going to divorce him for what? Being a good person? Fuckin loser", "Way to completely ignore what I said", "I\u2019m a marriage handing out money like that is a joint decision. But it seems like I\u2019m talking to another Reddit addicted loser whose never touched grass so you wouldn\u2019t understand that.", "There is no his money and her money, only their money. Both partners should be aware of making those big financial decisions together", "Username checks out", "Wow... you turned up the AH level.", "Of course your side hustle is your partners business. Why do you disagree with this? Doesn\u2019t make sense lol. Please actually explain via logic.", "She can send him to live with his brother at that point.", "Its not his wife\u2019s money. Its his own money that he worked for so he can afford to help a family member. I think it\u2019s sad that most people don\u2019t agree with me.", "What does that mean?", "Which part confuses you? I already asked my wife, long as I communicated my intent and there was no harm to us financially then it\u2019s my own business since I\u2019m not asking her to contribute anything. The only thing we both think is that money should have gone directly to the lawyer, but it\u2019s his extra hours, his choice.", "She can also pick up extra shifts to pay off her dogs debt sooner.", "Wdym what part confused me. There weren\u2019t any parts to begin with. You just asserted it wasn\u2019t their business without any logic justifying that. \n\nDid you ask \u201cwhich part confused you\u201d to posture and frame this interaction as if you are going over my head; condescending to me in order to, outside of logical argumentation, appear as if your perspective was more rational? Who can say \ud83d\ude02 \n\nThat\u2019s great if your wife feels that way. But sadly, that isn\u2019t an argument for or against anything. \n\nSo in short: saying something doesn\u2019t make it true, and your wife saying something also doesn\u2019t make it true", "Again, OP agreed to that. She didn't agree with this. The vet bill is not a relevant defense."]}
