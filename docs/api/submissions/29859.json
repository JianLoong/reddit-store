I don't have any problems with that, since I mostly just scroll on my phone while he is busy with an iPad or a TV-show.   \n\n\n  \nSometimes my nephew asks questions, like why is the Moon white and why is the grass green, and I answer him to the best of my ability. This time though, he came up with a different question. I was playing a game on my phone and he decided to hang around and watch how I play instead of continuing his TV-show. Nephew asked about some characters, in particular one male character that he seemed to like. He asked this character's name, who he is, is he the strongest in the game, etc. And then he asked a different question.   \n\n\n  \nHim: - Does he have a wife?   \n  \nme: - No, he has a boyfriend.   \n  \nHim: - ... How is that?   \n  \nme: - He is a boy who likes boys.   \n\n\n  \nThis seemed to really confuse little bro since I guess his parents never told him that gay people exist. He didn't ask any more questions about it, just accepted it as a fact. Or so I thought. His mother came back home, my \"babysitting\" duty ended and I went home.   \n\n\n  \nI took a nap but was woken up with a call from my dad. I mute my phone but since his calls are important and he rarely calls, it woke me up. He said I better call back my aunt-in-law, after which I saw 22 missed calls from her.   \n\n\n  \nObliviously, I called her back and she started to scream, shout and berate me for exposing her kid to some \"gay propaganda\", crying and saying now he will grow up a F-word. I didn't know she had those kinds of opinions about gay people, considering she saw me (22F) with my ex-girlfriend quite a lot, and we were open about our relationship. She said I tried to \"recruit her baby to the lgbt's\" and she should've never trusted me to babysit him.   \n\n\n  \nI'm not very argumentative, so I just listened to her scream a little and hung up. I understand that just saying \"he is a boy who likes boys\" is basically nothing and I didn't do anything bad, but I still think I overstepped a parenting boundary. Meaning, she or my uncle were supposed to be the ones to teach my nephew about gay people.

How is that?   \n  \nme: - He is a boy who likes boys.   \n\n\n  \nThis seemed to really confuse little bro since I guess his parents never told him that gay people exist. He didn't ask any more questions about it, just accepted it as a fact. Or so I thought. His mother came back home, my \"babysitting\" duty ended and I went home.   \n\n\n  \nI took a nap but was woken up with a call from my dad. I mute my phone but since his calls are important and he rarely calls, it woke me up. He said I better call back my aunt-in-law, after which I saw 22 missed calls from her.   \n\n\n  \nObliviously, I called her back and she started to scream, shout and berate me for exposing her kid to some \"gay propaganda\", crying and saying now he will grow up a F-word. I didn't know she had those kinds of opinions about gay people, considering she saw me (22F) with my ex-girlfriend quite a lot, and we were open about our relationship. She said I tried to \"recruit her baby to the lgbt's\" and she should've never trusted me to babysit him.   \n\n\n  \nI'm not very argumentative, so I just listened to her scream a little and hung up. I understand that just saying \"he is a boy who likes boys\" is basically nothing and I didn't do anything bad, but I still think I overstepped a parenting boundary. Meaning, she or my uncle were supposed to be the ones to teach my nephew about gay people. So, am I the asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

And it sounds like that aunt harbors hateful thoughts.", "It\u2019s not the same.", "That's not what's being talked about on this thread. The boys' parents are straight. This was some show that was being watched. It seems to me that mom and dad of the child aren't comfortable with their child being exposed to this kinda stuff. The kid will get plenty of exposure to that later on. I know I don't want my kid being taught this kinda stuff at a young age.", "> Seriously, idk why people would want their kids to know about the alphabet brigade that young.\n\nYou asked why people would, I gave you a reason why people would.
