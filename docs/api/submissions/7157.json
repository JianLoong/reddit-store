But YOU WERE USING IT AS INTENDED, AND IT BROKE UNDERNEATH YOU. That implies that you did not, in fact \"break it\", but rather that it was either regular wear and tear or the chair was faulty, and you were a victim, as it were, rather than a perpetrator of breakage upon her beloved piece of furniture. As such, it's not your responsibility to replace it at all. She should be apologising to you that her old chair left you dumped on the floor.

His mother is a vicious bully punishing you for not giving her what she wants, and she doesn't get how wrong that is. You're a human being, not an incubator.\n\nSince you do not plan on having children, be prepared for her to get worse. This means your husband is key here. He needs to have your back and hold the line against his mother; frankly, I'm surprised he hasn't already laid into her for bullying you. And if she sets the family flying monkeys on you for not going, ask them how they'd feel if she treated them like that.

We are both very ambitious and career driven and a child is just not the right step for us (that differs according to people but that has been our decision). \n\nLike I said she has been on my case ever since I turned 30 and repeatedly asked me if I\u2019m pregnant. One night I had enough and told her I\u2019m not planning on having children and if do change my mind I\u2019ll adopt. I also told her it\u2019s very insulting to ask a woman if they are pregnant all the time and what if I had been trying and going through miscarriages, it\u2019s just insensitive. She then went and cried in the bathroom while we were having dinner, like we were sitting there and we could hear her sob. \n\nMy husband has laid into her many time before. \n\nShe had an issue with me driving his electric car to town even though he drives my gas car for long distances (we live in a country with not a lot of charging stations otherwise we would both have electric), and he ended up screaming at her on the phone when she complained. She had an issue when we moved in together. She had an issue when we purchased a house together. She had an issue when we got married in court not because we couldn\u2019t afford a wedding celebration but because we thought we didn\u2019t need to spend money to show people we loved each other and that a piece of paper wouldn\u2019t change things between us. She had an issue with our dogs because they are rescues and not purebred (frankly they keep her away)\n\nEvery time she has complained about these things he has shut her down, down to the point where he shouts at her. She was really angry about the wedding because it wasn\u2019t held in a church. She has on numerous occasions threatened to write us out of the will. But now that my husband and my combined net worth is worth more than hers she can\u2019t use that one anymore. \n\nI think that\u2019s why she does it when my husband is out of the earshot, because she knows the reaction she will get from him. On Christmas she even made a comment in front of husbands step father and my husband step father started shitting her out saying you can\u2019t say that to people- and she just laughed and said it was a joke. \n\nMy SIL (my husbands brothers wife) has been on the receiving end of some of my MILs vitriol and I\u2019m glad that she also recently took a stand against my MIL. \n\nYou are right, the heading is misleading, I guess the chair is just the straw that broke the camels back.

I offered that my MIL, me and my husband go to counselling session with a neutral mediator but that was refused by my MIL.", "Husband is completely on my side thank goodness.

Very tacky, too.", "I apologised profusely and asked is there anything I can do?

Couldn't have been that expensively made, I have a cheap chair from the 60's I still sit my overweight butt in every day. The chair had to be half broken already for simply sitting on it to break it.", "First of all, I apologise for missing the sentence and writing the paragraph about what she might be like if you have kids. It genuinely wasn't done maliciously, I had a brain fart. \n\nHer behaviour in expecting you to basically be a vessel for providing her with grandkids is gross, and I'm really sorry she's behaving this way. I've never understood MIL's like this because, even if their kids do change their mind, why would they want said MIL around any kids they have after they've behaved so deplorably? \n\nLet me guess, her sobbing was the really overdramatic type, so absolutely no one could miss just how upset she was? \n\nI'm glad your husband has your back. I do think you've hit on why she likes saying you are poor, though: as long as she feels she can use her will as a bludgeon, she feels in control. Since you are making good money, you don't need an inheritance from her, and so there's a real chance she might not get her way, and that's just inconceivable for her. \n\nShe's never going to agree to therapy because then she might be told she's wrong and she might have to confront how awful she is; if she thought whatever the step-father heard her say was right and acceptable, she would have stood by it instead of brushing it off as a joke. \n\nI also feel bad for your husband because I think she's probably holding out that you're going to give in. Once she realises you are dead set in your decision and that the only slight possible chance of grandkids is an adopted child (and her view on rescue dogs vs purebreeds gives a huge hint about what she'll make of that), she's likely to go full batshit. You and your SIL and both husbands need to be braced for that, because if she can't get at you anymore because you've removed yourself from the firing line, she'll move on to her next target. \n\nHonestly, it's advice you see a lot, but MIL needs to be put in time out, but it is your husband's choice. From experience with toxic IL's, a word of warning: with you out of the way, she may see her chance to wheedle your husband round to her point of view. The old, \"Look, she's causing problems in the family, it's all her fault, I just want you to be happy,\" routine, with a side of guilt trips if he sees her less. There may come a time when you need to go no contact with her for the sake of you both, and your husband shouldn't feel guilty if it comes to that. His mother has chosen to be abusive to both her DILs, she is the one putting him in this awful position and she's forced you to remove yourself because you cannot take it anymore, nor should you. \n\nAlso, consider a Christmas/holiday contingency if you have been spending any with her. Since she's also awful to your SIL, maybe have it in mind that if she carries on, you'll spend the time that would be with her together instead, and could perhaps even invite other family members as well (I'd bet money she's awful to others as well. That lady has honed her nastiness on someone). I know it's early to think about it because the holidays are a way off, but if you sort it out now, she can't wheedle and you don't feel backed into a corner later on. Plus, it would give you and your SIL a relaxing break with no nasty comments. It's amazing how wonderful holidays are when you aren't waiting for the next snide comment you have to shrug off, or the latest attempt at amateur dramatics that you have to try and ignore. You can just drop your defences and enjoy yourself.", "I did read it, I missed that one bit but have edited accordingly. Thank you for pointing it out.", "Of course she has refused counselling because someone neutral would have pinpoint the issue is her...", "It's time to lessen your interactions with her.

It's great you apologized, and THAT moment should have been the moment your MiL politely said \"It's totally okay, but I can't afford to replace the chair. It's 200$ to replace it.\" Alternatively, as the person who broke it, I would immediately have offered to pay the cost to replace it. \n\nIt comes down to personal semantics.", "Right? My grandma had the same outdoor furniture for like 30 years and as far as I'm aware one of my aunt's is still using it.", "I have seen many chairs that are perfectly fine to sit on that break when a heavier person sits on it. That doesn't make it unsuitable for sitting.", "No worries, we are all guilty of misreading :) \n\nYeah the sobs were intense, we just sat in silence listening to them. I felt pretty bad but I think that\u2019s the reaction she wanted from me. \n\nShe has used financial measures in the past to control people. For example she brought my husband and his brother a new model oven for their birthdays (their birthdays are close together), but when it was delivered she said to my husband that he can\u2019t say no to her in the future. He got so angry he told the delivery company to take it back. \n\nMy husband and I have both made peace that we are not receiving any blood money (her will) and have made our retirement contributions and financial investments with that in mind. \n\nI\u2019m glad that I don\u2019t have to spend any more festive time with her, because frankly I have to usually take a Xanax every time before I see her and even though I am prescribed it, it\u2019s the only time I take it. I also come home completely drained from the experience. \n\nI\u2019m glad for my SIL, she has seen me setting boundaries and has started to herself. She and her husband have been married for 10 years already (they are high school sweethearts) and she has taken a lot more flak than I have to the point where she was given a laptop by husband when he got a new one (my MIL gave it to my husband as a birthday gift). When my MIL found out my husband gave it to my SIL, she demanded it back. \n\nThere is a lot of therapy that she needs to do.

But OK.", "Thankyou for your kind words. I appreciate it", "Nah its better to say something like that upfront. Otherwise they are like i dont understand why you dont over anymore.

I feel as though she used to the invoice as a malicious tactic instead of talking it out. Like I was offended because everyone said it was fine but it was not fine. \n\nEdit: extra information", "Yeah I just don't understand how someone can blame a chair breaking from being sat on on the user lol.
