They don't drive and has basically lost every option they had at work because it's so bad it leaves a lasting impression on the inside of their cars. They asked me for a ride and I told them exactly why I wouldn't.\n\nFor me personal hygiene is something that can have an effect on the people around you.

You gave it 5 years & ended things.\n\nIf he can't get over his bitterness and wants to continue rehashing the past with his \"what ifs,\" maybe you need to let the friendship die.\n\nHugs and Good Luck", "NTA. I don't know how you made it 5 years in a relationship with a man whose smell you don't like. Smell is incredibly important to physical attraction. While I can stand being around people whose smell I don't like for a few hours, I could never do it day in and day out. Not to mention being intimately close.", "NTA- I\u2019m only in my early 20\u2019s and hygiene is important even to me. That is a make or break for me. Physical attraction can change depending on how you view someone personality wise. RN you\u2019re rethinking things because you\u2019re apart but if you got close to him you\u2019d rethink things all over again. \nWhat was his level of hygiene though? I can understand getting away with not showering everyday if he doesn\u2019t do a lot of activity, forgetting to brush twice a day and only doing it once, having organized chaos in his apartment, and needing a dusting. If he\u2019s constantly growing science projects on himself and in his apartment then you have every right to be grossed out.", "Ah humans\u2026 \n\nLook it\u2019s all biological. You didn\u2019t like his pheromones. Can\u2019t control that. Can\u2019t overcome that. Don\u2019t overthink it. It\u2019s subconscious biological hardwiring, all the good intentions in the world can\u2019t overcome it. \n\nYou know how to tell when a woman loves the crap out of you and wants to f*** your brains out? When you get home, you hug her, and she just breathes in your smell. You can\u2019t tell me I\u2019m wrong there. \n\nAnyway NTA.", "NTA.\n\nYou two weren't a good match, and the fact that he's trying to guilt you about it now just confirms that.", "NTA, this is just a massive blackpill, you can't overcome your human instincts.", "ESH\n\nI mean, yeah, he should have worked on his hygiene and mental health issues from the start. However, it seems you knew from the beginning it wasn\u2019t going to work yet still kept the relationship going. Why? Who does that benefit? If you weren\u2019t attracted to him from the start and he had hygiene/mental health issues present from the very beginning, why did you spend FIVE YEARS with him? I can understand giving it a few months or maybe even a year and seeing how things go but spending FIVE YEARS with someone you weren\u2019t fond of in the first place is just a disservice to everyone involved.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
