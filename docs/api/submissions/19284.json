But at the weekend Jane and I were having lunch at my house, and she was telling me how worn out she\u2019s been feeling lately. She works full time and is the primary earner in their house because John works part time and plays soccer for a local team on the weekends. She\u2019s also in the pre-treatment phase of IVF. She explained to me that she feels when she\u2019s home she\u2019s always either cleaning or cooking. \n\nShe commented that I\u2019ve never ever complained about chores around the house or that Sam doesn\u2019t do any.  I told her that it\u2019s because we split things equally. At the beginning of each week we jointly agree upon which chores in specific need to be done that week, we both have chores that we love but the other hates so we take care of those ourselves, and we divide both the planning and execution of the remaining ones equally. Jane gave me the run down of chore splits and it basically comes down to: he does a few short chores which she plans, and she does everything else including planning of chores they do together like grocery shopping. I told her that she\u2019s probably been feeling worn down because she\u2019s burned out from having to plan everything he does as well as take care of her own stuff for so long. She said that that\u2019s unfair , he does do things and I replied saying that he physically does things but she does all of the planning and that even if the execution of those chores was equal, the division of labor still wouldn\u2019t be. She does all of the emotional labor as well as her physical labor and that the division isn\u2019t even close to equal. She got mad and left, she hasn\u2019t spoken to me since which is unusual.

It was exhausting, but I think many women are raised to do that. Maybe she'll recognise herself in this?

If you keep pushing your view when she's not willing to accept it then this could change though.", "NTA. \n\nAnd I\u2019ve been saying for years THIS is exactly why there is so much opposition to gay marriage and to the changing of gender norms.

Sounds like you\u2019ve disrupted the image of her \u201cfunhouse.\u201d First of all, absolutely NTA. Secondly, the Funhouse is a concept that my 84 year old grandmother talks about in the context of dysfunctional marriages. She saw women in the 1950\u2019s and 60\u2019s marry men that were mistreating them in some manner or another. Instead of these women leaving those men to find someone better, they pretend everything is ok, living their lives in the Funhouse, where the illusion of satisfaction is alive. Your sister got with John at such a young age that she hasn\u2019t shopped around at other men. At this point, your sister is probably terrified to leave this marriage and start all over, so she\u2019s trying to make this work. My only parting advice to you would be to not bring this topic up again. You\u2019ve said your piece once and you sister will never forget that. She reacted this way because she knows you are right so repeating this discussion won\u2019t add anything new.", "You are 100% right, and probably 100% TA, although it's hard to tell. You clearly don't like John, as you pointed out. You mentioned that he does the physical labor, but you never talk about what that is. There's a good chance that you were rude and/or condescending about her husband, which is an AH move. It's also her relationship, so while it's totally understandable to explain how you do things in your relationship, it may not be appropriate to start telling her what's wrong with her relationship. \n\nAll that said, it sounds like your sister is married to a bum, and if she thinks she's overwhelmed now, it's going to be a lot worse with a baby that he will probably fall short on caring for. Tough situation, and a good example where being TA might be the right move since you're trying to support and care for your sister.", "NTA but it probably would have gone better if you only talked about your experience - \"my partner and I decided that the mental load needed to be split in half, as well as the physical act of doing chores\". No matter your intentions or how well you phrase it, commenting on how someone else runs their life can sound like a judgment. Your sister is probably reacting to that feeling of being judged more than the advice you gave her. She also didn't even ask for advice, she asked what you did at home to make chores feel equal.", "NTA for pointing it out the first time but YTA for insisting you\u2019re right after she tells you you\u2019re not being fair and that he does do things. There\u2019s no emotional labor in saying \u201cYou do the dishes while I fold laundry\u201d or whatever chores their planning. Nobody is sitting a desk painstakingly planning chores for hours.", "Possibly YTA. With your dislike for John I imagine your words did not come out as nice as they did here. I mean you\u2019re not wrong but sis might not have taken it as help and possibly felt criticized. \n\nIf I were you (which I\u2019m not so feel free to handle as you please) id reach out first and let her know that you care about her and would like to give some tips on how you and your partner lean on each other.", "Going against the grain and saying YTA. She didn\u2019t come to you with a problem about her life or marriage, she was simply mentioning that she\u2019s tired and overwhelmed and you took it on yourself to tell her the reasons her partner and marriage suck. The reality is that you aren\u2019t there most of the time and it has nothing to do with you. She was most likely hoping for the support of her sister while she goes through something very taxing (IVF and infertility), and instead you criticized her husband and marriage. Who wants to stay and listen to someone belittle the people they care about? It was unwelcome.", "Eh, I'll go with a soft YTA. You're likely right about your sister's dynamic, that's not being put into question. But something I've had to learn long ago with my wife is that often when she comes to me with issues or problems, she comes to vent and just wants to be heard, she doesn't come for solutions or to have her life or choices be picked apart. I think it was OK to point out the existence of the mental load and how the split might not be as even as she thought it was, but a soft YTA for pushing after she said you were being unfair. You could've just said \"Sure, if you say so\" and leave it at that. You would have still planted a seed and not antagonized your sister. She's tired, no doubt very emotional from the IVF hormones... It's not really about who's right or not at this point, it's about supporting your sister and respecting her choices.", "Let's see...\n\nHe:\n1. Works part time \n2. Attends to his hobby \n3. Helps out partially if he's told\n\nAnd she:\n1. Works full time\n2. Manages the house full time\n3. Feels exhausted. \n4. But she wants to add in a baby... when (return to the top)\n\n\nI'm trying to make this make sense.  Not sure how she thinks that's going to go for her. \n\nHonestly, people who put themselves in these senseless loops just want a brick wall to vent to occasionally. It re-energizes them so they can get back on the hampster wheel to nowhere because in some unfathomable way, it works for them. They don't want our insights nor do they ask for it. When they're finally tied off it, they'll let you know. \n\nAlso,  (and I'm sure you know this) not all relationships look like yours, and comparing straws is a pretty condescending thing to do. Comes off like my kids when one is struggling and the other does the \"good kid\" bit: \"I'M not doing those things, right mommy? I'M doing it RIGHT, right mommy???AMIRIGHT?????\" and naturally, that pisses off the other kid, who now thinks their sib is an AH.\n\nYour not an AH. Just that part was AH-ish.", "YMBTA, Everyone is allowed to vent to their close friends and family about being tired and run down. That doesn't mean it has to be a big deal. Whatever the breakdown of labour it, it obviously works in their relationship and has done for a long time. If that dynamic is tiring your sister out, she should be able to comment on that without you going in on her partner for everything you don't like about him. It sounds like she was venting and you escalated it to bring up your concerns about her relationship which seems to work for her. You're NTA but you're not faultless.", "Eh\u2026this is so mild in the grand scheme of things & can be easily fixed, but, you\u2019re *kinda* the asshole for implying her husband\u2019s an asshole, as I feel their division of labor still seems quite fair.

You might want to reach out...message her...if you have spare time...maybe ask how the IVF is going and if you can do anything to help...if you have the extra time? Plan a spa day if she's into that? I've never had a sister so I'm guessing at stuff she might like.", "NTA, he is definitely freeloading and a fair division of labor - very much including mental and emotional - is super important for a couple, and even more so for (future) parents. He needs to stand up and do shit without the need to be asked and explained for the 20th times how to put a socks in the washing machine, etc. \n\nThat being said, I don't think your timing was great. If you've never undergone IVF, you might not realize how it takes a toll on your mind and body. The appointments, the pre-treatment stress, the recurring ultrasounds - and all the time out from work needed to get all these tests done, followed very soon by the daily (sometimes several times a day) injections, the hormonal outbreak, more tests and ultrasounds, then the egg retrieval in the ER, the wait to hear from embryology, the embryo transfer, and then the 2WW... We'd all say it was worth it if we end up having a viable pregnancy and baby, but it is fucking hard. \n\nCriticizing her and her marriage (even though John definitely sounds like a loser to me) at this specific moment isn't really helping.

We both don\u2019t mind vacuuming so we usually divide that in half and we usually do it based on which rooms we think will take the longest that week and we do one of the long rooms each (i\u2019ll do the living room and she\u2019ll do the kitchen for example) and the remaining rooms are usually divided by who has the most time on that week. We meal plan together on a Sunday, then write our list and go grocery shopping together and if we forget something either I\u2019ll pick it up on the way home from the gym or she\u2019ll pick it up on the way home from the office depending on when we notice we forgot it. I walk the dog in the morning and she walks him at night during the week and at weekends we walk him together. I do the wiping of surfaces with wipes stuff once a week (usually on a Monday), and she does it again a couple days later (Wednesday, usually) so nothing really gets the chance to build up and it takes way less time. I make note of trash collecting days and she takes the trash out for a couple of weeks and then we switch for a couple of weeks (our city only collects trash every 10 days, but there are different pick ups for different types of trash once a week). I feed the dog in the morning and she feeds him at night. I cook 3 dinners a week and she cooks 3 dinners a week and then we usually get takeout once a week, we\u2019re responsible for our own breakfast and lunch since I\u2019m an early riser and she definitely isn\u2019t. For things that only happen occasionally like deep cleaning the bathroom or other rooms we usually pick a date like once a month on a Sunday and I do half of the tasks we agree need done and she does the other half. We both play sports recreationally (but regularly) so even though I usually do our laundry, we\u2019re each responsible for our own gear. \n\nWe also babysit for her sister during the week because we both work irregular hours so we\u2019re usually at home while her sister is working. So in terms of childcare: I always help with math and language homework, Sam helps with science and everything else (for context, he\u2019s 8). We alternate school drop offs in the morning depending on our work schedules. Usually we\u2019ll both take him to school on Monday, and then Sam takes him on Tuesdays and Wednesdays and I take him on Thursdays and Fridays. His mom picks him up on a Monday because she finishes early, but at night the opposite of who drops him off picks him up. We both take him to after school clubs/soccer practice. On nights he has to stay with us we divide the night time routine based on his preferences so I read him his story because he prefers when I do it and Sam makes sure he brushes his teeth/goes to the bathroom/ has showered. We eat together so he eats with us and whatever who ever cooked that night made but occasionally he\u2019ll ask for something different and we usually do that together because it\u2019s quicker. \n\nBasically we divide all household tasks into personal chores (being responsible for our own gear for example) and communal (everything that involves both of us) and childcare. Then we break it down into things that need to be done everyday, things that need to be done once or twice a week and things that only need to be done once a month or so and we divide them based on enjoyment, time constraints and then just what needs to be done. We decide on these things together, who is responsible for each thing together and the rough time frame they\u2019ll be done and it really avoids having arguments like \u201cyou didn\u2019t do x\u201d \u201cwell you didn\u2019t ask me to do x\u201d because we make sure we both know what we\u2019re doing and have agreed on what needs to be done. It also reduces the amount of time most of the tasks take because we both have more energy to do our part and they pretty much always get done (unless we\u2019re sick or something obviously). \n\nI hope this helps! I feel like I\u2019ve forgotten something.", "Not OP but my husband and I do something similar.
