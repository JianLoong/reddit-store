Jane has been married to her husband John (32m) for 9 years, but they\u2019ve been together since she was 17. I have been with mu girlfriend Sam (26f) for 4 years and we\u2019ve lived together for 3. \n\nJane and I are quite close and usually tell each other most things, including relationship issues. Full disclosure: for the past few years as I\u2019ve grown up, I realised I don\u2019t really like John, I think he\u2019s a bit of an ass but I\u2019ve kept it to myself unless my sister specifically asked. But at the weekend Jane and I were having lunch at my house, and she was telling me how worn out she\u2019s been feeling lately. She works full time and is the primary earner in their house because John works part time and plays soccer for a local team on the weekends. She\u2019s also in the pre-treatment phase of IVF. She explained to me that she feels when she\u2019s home she\u2019s always either cleaning or cooking. \n\nShe commented that I\u2019ve never ever complained about chores around the house or that Sam doesn\u2019t do any.  I told her that it\u2019s because we split things equally. At the beginning of each week we jointly agree upon which chores in specific need to be done that week, we both have chores that we love but the other hates so we take care of those ourselves, and we divide both the planning and execution of the remaining ones equally. Jane gave me the run down of chore splits and it basically comes down to: he does a few short chores which she plans, and she does everything else including planning of chores they do together like grocery shopping. I told her that she\u2019s probably been feeling worn down because she\u2019s burned out from having to plan everything he does as well as take care of her own stuff for so long. She said that that\u2019s unfair , he does do things and I replied saying that he physically does things but she does all of the planning and that even if the execution of those chores was equal, the division of labor still wouldn\u2019t be. She does all of the emotional labor as well as her physical labor and that the division isn\u2019t even close to equal. She got mad and left, she hasn\u2019t spoken to me since which is unusual.

Sounds like you\u2019ve disrupted the image of her \u201cfunhouse.\u201d First of all, absolutely NTA. Secondly, the Funhouse is a concept that my 84 year old grandmother talks about in the context of dysfunctional marriages. She saw women in the 1950\u2019s and 60\u2019s marry men that were mistreating them in some manner or another. Instead of these women leaving those men to find someone better, they pretend everything is ok, living their lives in the Funhouse, where the illusion of satisfaction is alive. Your sister got with John at such a young age that she hasn\u2019t shopped around at other men. At this point, your sister is probably terrified to leave this marriage and start all over, so she\u2019s trying to make this work. My only parting advice to you would be to not bring this topic up again. You\u2019ve said your piece once and you sister will never forget that. She reacted this way because she knows you are right so repeating this discussion won\u2019t add anything new.", "You are 100% right, and probably 100% TA, although it's hard to tell. You clearly don't like John, as you pointed out. You mentioned that he does the physical labor, but you never talk about what that is. There's a good chance that you were rude and/or condescending about her husband, which is an AH move. It's also her relationship, so while it's totally understandable to explain how you do things in your relationship, it may not be appropriate to start telling her what's wrong with her relationship. \n\nAll that said, it sounds like your sister is married to a bum, and if she thinks she's overwhelmed now, it's going to be a lot worse with a baby that he will probably fall short on caring for. Tough situation, and a good example where being TA might be the right move since you're trying to support and care for your sister.", "NTA but it probably would have gone better if you only talked about your experience - \"my partner and I decided that the mental load needed to be split in half, as well as the physical act of doing chores\". No matter your intentions or how well you phrase it, commenting on how someone else runs their life can sound like a judgment. Your sister is probably reacting to that feeling of being judged more than the advice you gave her. She also didn't even ask for advice, she asked what you did at home to make chores feel equal.", "NTA for pointing it out the first time but YTA for insisting you\u2019re right after she tells you you\u2019re not being fair and that he does do things. There\u2019s no emotional labor in saying \u201cYou do the dishes while I fold laundry\u201d or whatever chores their planning. Nobody is sitting a desk painstakingly planning chores for hours.", "Possibly YTA. With your dislike for John I imagine your words did not come out as nice as they did here. I mean you\u2019re not wrong but sis might not have taken it as help and possibly felt criticized. \n\nIf I were you (which I\u2019m not so feel free to handle as you please) id reach out first and let her know that you care about her and would like to give some tips on how you and your partner lean on each other.", "Going against the grain and saying YTA. She didn\u2019t come to you with a problem about her life or marriage, she was simply mentioning that she\u2019s tired and overwhelmed and you took it on yourself to tell her the reasons her partner and marriage suck. The reality is that you aren\u2019t there most of the time and it has nothing to do with you. She was most likely hoping for the support of her sister while she goes through something very taxing (IVF and infertility), and instead you criticized her husband and marriage. Who wants to stay and listen to someone belittle the people they care about? It was unwelcome.", "Eh, I'll go with a soft YTA. You're likely right about your sister's dynamic, that's not being put into question. But something I've had to learn long ago with my wife is that often when she comes to me with issues or problems, she comes to vent and just wants to be heard, she doesn't come for solutions or to have her life or choices be picked apart. I think it was OK to point out the existence of the mental load and how the split might not be as even as she thought it was, but a soft YTA for pushing after she said you were being unfair. You could've just said \"Sure, if you say so\" and leave it at that. You would have still planted a seed and not antagonized your sister. She's tired, no doubt very emotional from the IVF hormones... It's not really about who's right or not at this point, it's about supporting your sister and respecting her choices.", "Let's see...\n\nHe:\n1. Works part time \n2. Attends to his hobby \n3.

But she wants to add in a baby... when (return to the top)\n\n\nI'm trying to make this make sense.  Not sure how she thinks that's going to go for her. \n\nHonestly, people who put themselves in these senseless loops just want a brick wall to vent to occasionally. It re-energizes them so they can get back on the hampster wheel to nowhere because in some unfathomable way, it works for them. They don't want our insights nor do they ask for it. When they're finally tied off it, they'll let you know. \n\nAlso,  (and I'm sure you know this) not all relationships look like yours, and comparing straws is a pretty condescending thing to do. Comes off like my kids when one is struggling and the other does the \"good kid\" bit: \"I'M not doing those things, right mommy? I'M doing it RIGHT, right mommy???AMIRIGHT?????\" and naturally, that pisses off the other kid, who now thinks their sib is an AH.\n\nYour not an AH. Just that part was AH-ish.", "YMBTA, Everyone is allowed to vent to their close friends and family about being tired and run down. That doesn't mean it has to be a big deal. Whatever the breakdown of labour it, it obviously works in their relationship and has done for a long time. If that dynamic is tiring your sister out, she should be able to comment on that without you going in on her partner for everything you don't like about him. It sounds like she was venting and you escalated it to bring up your concerns about her relationship which seems to work for her. You're NTA but you're not faultless.", "Eh\u2026this is so mild in the grand scheme of things & can be easily fixed, but, you\u2019re *kinda* the asshole for implying her husband\u2019s an asshole, as I feel their division of labor still seems quite fair.

You might want to reach out...message her...if you have spare time...maybe ask how the IVF is going and if you can do anything to help...if you have the extra time? Plan a spa day if she's into that? I've never had a sister so I'm guessing at stuff she might like.", "NTA, he is definitely freeloading, and a fair division of labor - very much including mental and emotional - is super important for a couple, and even more so for (future) parents. He needs to stand up and do shit without the need to be asked and explained for the 20th times how to put a socks in the washing machine, etc.\n\nThat being said, I don't think your timing was great. If you've never undergone IVF, you might not realize how it takes a toll on your mind and body. The appointments, the pre-treatment stress, the recurring ultrasounds - and all the time out from work needed to get all these tests done, followed very soon by the daily (sometimes several times a day) injections, the hormonal outbreak, more tests and ultrasounds, then the egg retrieval in the ER, the wait to hear from embryology, the embryo transfer, and then the 2WW... We'd all say it was worth it if we end up having a viable pregnancy and baby, but it is fucking hard.\n\nCriticizing her and her marriage (even though John definitely sounds like a loser to me) at this specific moment isn't really helping.

We both don\u2019t mind vacuuming so we usually divide that in half and we usually do it based on which rooms we think will take the longest that week and we do one of the long rooms each (i\u2019ll do the living room and she\u2019ll do the kitchen for example) and the remaining rooms are usually divided by who has the most time on that week. We meal plan together on a Sunday, then write our list and go grocery shopping together and if we forget something either I\u2019ll pick it up on the way home from the gym or she\u2019ll pick it up on the way home from the office depending on when we notice we forgot it. I walk the dog in the morning and she walks him at night during the week and at weekends we walk him together. I do the wiping of surfaces with wipes stuff once a week (usually on a Monday), and she does it again a couple days later (Wednesday, usually) so nothing really gets the chance to build up and it takes way less time. I make note of trash collecting days and she takes the trash out for a couple of weeks and then we switch for a couple of weeks (our city only collects trash every 10 days, but there are different pick ups for different types of trash once a week). I feed the dog in the morning and she feeds him at night. I cook 3 dinners a week and she cooks 3 dinners a week and then we usually get takeout once a week, we\u2019re responsible for our own breakfast and lunch since I\u2019m an early riser and she definitely isn\u2019t. For things that only happen occasionally like deep cleaning the bathroom or other rooms we usually pick a date like once a month on a Sunday and I do half of the tasks we agree need done and she does the other half. We both play sports recreationally (but regularly) so even though I usually do our laundry, we\u2019re each responsible for our own gear. \n\nWe also babysit for her sister during the week because we both work irregular hours so we\u2019re usually at home while her sister is working. So in terms of childcare: I always help with math and language homework, Sam helps with science and everything else (for context, he\u2019s 8). We alternate school drop offs in the morning depending on our work schedules. Usually we\u2019ll both take him to school on Monday, and then Sam takes him on Tuesdays and Wednesdays and I take him on Thursdays and Fridays. His mom picks him up on a Monday because she finishes early, but at night the opposite of who drops him off picks him up. We both take him to after school clubs/soccer practice. On nights he has to stay with us we divide the night time routine based on his preferences so I read him his story because he prefers when I do it and Sam makes sure he brushes his teeth/goes to the bathroom/ has showered. We eat together so he eats with us and whatever who ever cooked that night made but occasionally he\u2019ll ask for something different and we usually do that together because it\u2019s quicker. \n\nBasically we divide all household tasks into personal chores (being responsible for our own gear for example) and communal (everything that involves both of us) and childcare. Then we break it down into things that need to be done everyday, things that need to be done once or twice a week and things that only need to be done once a month or so and we divide them based on enjoyment, time constraints and then just what needs to be done. We decide on these things together, who is responsible for each thing together and the rough time frame they\u2019ll be done and it really avoids having arguments like \u201cyou didn\u2019t do x\u201d \u201cwell you didn\u2019t ask me to do x\u201d because we make sure we both know what we\u2019re doing and have agreed on what needs to be done.

These people need a spreadsheet.   On the spreadsheet, list every chore and duty that needs to be done (including the mental load), how long it takes, and how often it has to be done.  Jobs also get put in the spreadsheet with number of hours.   Paid work and work around the house count the same.   Hobbies and sports do not go on the spreadsheet.  The goal is to determine the amount of free time each person has per week and what that free time is used for is irrelevant.   I think a lot of people  give typically man-type chores way more credit than they deserve.   For example, some people might say he cuts the grass and she cooks the meals.  Cutting the grass takes 2 hours a week.  Cooking the meals takes 14 hours a week, yet some people would consider those tasks equal, which they are not.\n\nThe end goal is equalize the amount of free time each person has.    It\u2019s very obvious that the sister has very little free time and is doing just about everything.   Heaven help her when she has a child and the care of that child just gets tacked onto her duties.\n\nI can never understand why anyone is willing to accept unfair situations like this.   Did her wedding vows include her signing up to be his mommy, doing everything, and supervising and directing the few things he does?   Lord, I would not sign up for that job in a million years and I surely wouldn\u2019t have a child with a person who is a user, not a real partner.\n\nMany of us grew up with parents where mom stayed at home and did all housework and childcare, and dad worked full-time, and other than things like lawn care and car maintenance, their time was free.    Mom would be working far into the evening, making meals, cleaning up, helping with homework, making lunches for the next day, and meanwhile dad is sitting on the couch because he \u201cworked hard all day\u201d, like housework and childcare don\u2019t count for much.\n\nSomehow many women still feel like if the house isn\u2019t sparkling clean or the meals aren\u2019t all nutritious and homemade, that she is failing as a wife/mother, even if she works full time, because their mom who didn\u2019t work outside the house handled everything else.   This thinking needs to end, even for women who are stay-at-home moms.   Each person, regardless of whether their \u201cwork\u201d is at home or elsewhere, deserves the same amount of free time.  We should not settle for less.", "\"Aren't you embarrassed?\"", "I also think that regardless of the relationship, you should have someone's consent to tell them hard truths first", ">Part of getting older is being tired \n\nNot when you work part-time, spend your weekends playing soccer and wait to be asked before you grab milk and bread from the grocery store while your wife does everything at one + works full time...", "Hahahaha so companies shouldn\u2019t  managers or strategic management plans for time and resources ?

What a shocker! /s", "She\u2019s gonna have a fun time finding out what kinda father he\u2019s gonna be \ud83d\ude43", "NTA", "NTA\nShe's already raising a child, who will never grow up.  Doesn't sound like she has the time or energy for another child.", "NTA. Your sister heard the truth and didn't like it. John should be working full time and equally sharing the mental and physical responsibility of household chores. Things are only going to get worse for Jane if and or when she conceives if nothing changes now.", "NTA. Most likely, your sister realizes you are correct but doesn\u2019t want to admit that she\u2019s in a bad marriage. It\u2019s easier for her to just blame you rather than face the reality of her situation.", "NTA\n\nBut I'm more concerned about the IVF.\n\nFFS. Convince her to not do that.", "Unless she's got herself a hobby that takes up about as much time as his soccer, that's a horribly inequitable division of labor.\n\nNot only is he working only part time, but taking a lighter share of the work at home so he can go play. The soccer stuff might be physically challenging but it's mentally and emotionally renewing.", "Same!", "this comment! now that you have said the thing and she has heard you enough to be mad about it, you go full support mode. you won\u2019t convince her by giving her more sources and descriptions\u2026you have to give her the space and the grace to admit you might have a point.", "And the mother should be backing OP's message for her daughter's sake, not guilting the daughter who answered her sister's questions honestky,", "Well, BIL is awfully busy playing football & drinking wth teammates 2 days out of 7. \nNTA. Your sister is having a bad time but does not want to hear the truth. She's ghosting the messenger.", "*correction: honestly.", "Excel has a template for that.", "NTA.  It\u2019ll get worse with a kid, so you told her the hard truth she was probably already realizing.", "NTA sometimes true things aren\u2019t easy to hear. But better that you were straight with her instead of just listening and telling her everything will be okay.", "NTA\n\nYour sister brought up the subject of chores and being tired. You explained your situation then she explained hers. You commented on the differences. She doesn't have to like the differences; that's OK. What's she done is get mad at you for pointing out the differences that she doesn't want to acknowledge. She started defending her husband for the same reason.\n\nYou didn't do anything wrong, but to move forward, you can simply say, \"*I'm sorry our conversation upset you. If you are happy with how your household works, then I am happy for you.*\" Then you don't have to say another word. She's already aware of the differences, so you don't have to mention them again. She's already defended the logic and 'fairness' of her home situation, so you don't have to consider it again. If she ever brings up being tired again, you can simply reply, \"*I'm sure you will figure it out.*\" or \"*Yes, my situation does seem to work for me.*\" and refrain from expressing any further thoughts on the matter.", "NTA. She knows you\u2019re right. He\u2019s a user. She\u2019s been with this guy far too long.", "The truth doesn't hurt unless it ought to \ud83e\udd37", "NTA\n\nMy advice is from personal experience being you:\n\nIf the relationship matters more than being right than you'll keep your mouth shut. She'll defend her way of life even if she doesn't agree with it wholeheartedly because it's where she's at and who she's with. She reacts defensively and will come back to it if she wants to.", "NTA I hope thos is a wakeup call for Hane. She needs to really think about whether she wants to do 90 percent of the cooking, cleaning, AND childcare for a baby.", "yeah, there's a huge difference between telling a friend/relative you don't like their new hairstyle (when there's nothing *objectively* wrong with it and it's just your subjective opinion that no one asked for) and telling them that you think they may be being taken advantage of. \n\nthe former is just being rude for no reason, the latter is showing that you *care*.", "Haha, this is the first time I've ever seen someone suggesting that having good communication with your partner is a sad thing. I actually love discussing everything with my partner! But you do you, I guess :D", "well, you can dial it back cause I never said that. Do you always misinterpret things? cause that's gonna suck for any partner and goes against the whole bs where you said you love discussing things with your partner.\n\nor is it only internet folks you play that game with?", "NTA you just explained to her what the mental load is. I think she\u2019s just upset about having to deal with this with her husband now and that the wool has been pulled off her eyes than upset of you pointing it out.", "NTA\n\nA revealing question would be to ask, \"How many times have you stopped yourself from asking him because you know he won't do it, that he'll do it wrong, or that he'll expect something in return?\"\n\nYour sister has a lot on her plate. She's actively and painfully trying for a baby with this man and doing more than her share of work. The stress from that is not suddenly eased by realizing she needs to expect better from him, that he needs to change for her to be happier and healthier. The fallout of dealing with this could go a lot of ways, and some of them include losing her husband and future child for the hope of better treatment elsewhere. It's emotional, to say the least. \n\nIf you can, try to give her some grace for her reaction. Be there for her if she comes back for help, even if it's just for ways to change in a healthy manner while staying with him. Who knows, maybe he could learn a little empathy and be less of an ass.", "With a partner like that, your sister shouldn't even be thinking of having a child with him. That's only going to be more work pushed onto her juggling between her job, housework, and the child's needs while he gets to slack around and have fun with friends. OP is NTA", "NTA, you just spoke the truth. Whether or not she does anything with her is her own issue.\n\nAlso, it sounds to me like John is a kid living with his mother. She seems to be doing everything...", "NTA. The truth hurts, and she\u2019s angry that you pointed out that she\u2019s doing an unequal share, which is wearing her out.", "This is a pet topic of mine and I've had very good friends (like sisters to me) who've had this conversation with me and I've been very blunt about my thoughts and I've also sent them a spreadsheet they can use to divide up the chores equally. They've all been very excited by the spreadsheet, and I believe they've all had \"the chat\" with  their other half, and had agreement about a new division of chores. To the best of my knowledge, that lasts a few weeks for every one of them and then it went back to the way it was before. I don't ever have that conversation a second time with them. If they raise the topic with me again, I say something like \"we've talked about this before and you know my views. It's up to you to change this and so long as you don't, there isn't any sense in keeping on asking for advice on it\" (but in kind and supportive words and tone).\n\nPeople who enable an unfair distribution of household chores are the ones who have to fix the issue. The only way to do this is to stop doing an unfair share of the household chores, either by agreement or not. It's really that simple.", "Obviously somebody willingly doing household chores for their family is a slave", "As you said \"The thing is it's not about distribution, it's adults adulting and therefor no need for discussion.\" We like to discuss everything, so yes discussion needed ;)\n\nAnd you're making some bold assumptions about me and my relationship too. But that's okay, since you're an Internet stranger and it doesn't matter. I find this rather boring and fruitless, so have a nice weekend! :)", "> We like to discuss everything, so he's, discussion needed ;)\n\nWhat? That's not something I said. If you're saying it i think your auto correct failed you.\n\nI stand by what I said. My husband and I have never once discussed household chores... we just do them. Even joke sometimes cause \"oh well I was gonna do the dishes but you got to them first\" in a fun way. So yea, adults adulting, I wish everyone had that sort of partnership and I'm sorry they don't, that's sad. I'm not saying we're perfect, no one is and no relationship is. But you should at least link up with someone who can do the basics without having to be told.", "The part you said is the part between the quotation marks, the rest is what I said. \n\nBut yeah, I have to agree that it's sad that many people (from what I've seen, mostly women though) end up in relationships where they basically do everything around the house while the other person pretty much doesn't do anything. Sadly, many people don't even realise that they have taken this role and that's why I share comics like that. As you say, no grown up should be told to do basic home chores and that is exactly what the comic says as well. That's not the same as discussing it though, discussing how you divide up chores is not the same as having to tell someone else what they need to do. If I'm honest, if a couple has been together for several years and one is just not pulling their weight, I don't have much hope for the relationship getting better (unless both are really very motivated to change things).", "NTA. She is mad at herself for allowing her marriage to get like this", "Nta, you kept it real and she couldn't handle it.....", "He does know that he is going to have to step if your sister gets pregnant and they have a baby right or is your sister going to have to do all the kid stuff and John going to be the guy complaining about having to babysit his child for five minutes while your sister goes to the toilet", "My son is 21.  Monday is uni and work.  Tuesday is uni.  Wednesday is  work.  Thursday and Friday is uni.  Saturday is sport.  Sunday is work.  Add in training up to three times a week.\n\nHis sport is not something that will ever make him money, but he does play at a high level.  He still manages to do full-time uni and two part-time jobs.  And he's 21.\n\nWhat is this bozo's excuse?"]}
