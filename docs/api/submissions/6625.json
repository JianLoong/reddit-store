My father is a recovering alcoholic, and my brother is a recovering drug addict. My biggest piece of advice to you is this: don\u2019t enable her. Do NOT let her crash on your couch, because once she\u2019s there, you know you won\u2019t have the heart to make her leave. She most likely won\u2019t look for other housing arrangements once she\u2019s there. I know you said she recognizes that she has a problem, but unless she is seeking out PROFESSIONAL help for her alcoholism, then she doesn\u2019t actually recognize it. Believe me, when an alcoholic truly recognizes that they have problem, they also recognize that this problem is much bigger than they can handle on their own, and they\u2019ll look for that help. Otherwise any statement of recognition is just her saying it to appease you. And I know that because it\u2019s what my dad used to do. My dad would say he knew he had a problem, and promise that he\u2019d do better and this time will be different ect. But he was saying that to get my mom off his back. I know you care very much for her, and it is really hard to let the people we love fall on their face. You can urge them to seek help, you can do all kinds of things to try to help them, you can suggest treatment groups, support groups, rehabs, AA ect. but it doesn\u2019t matter how much help you give them, none of it will matter until they\u2019re ready and ask for help. In my experience with my family, the worst thing you can do is give them safe place to land. Which means: don\u2019t provide housing, basic necessities, creature comforts, and especially DO NOT give them money. As long as you are providing those things, they will continue drinking/using because their addiction isn\u2019t jeopardizing their safe place to crash, or their quality of life. Why should they stop? they\u2019ve still got a place to sleep, someone cleaning up their messes and covering their ass, food on their plate, their needs and wants, their drinking hasn\u2019t taken that away so it can\u2019t be THAT much of a problem. (sarcasm of course) \nAs much as it hurts, you have to let them hit rock bottom. Most people have to lose everything, or damn near, before they realize that their addiction is destroying/destroyed their life. The only way to really help them long term, is to let them. Refusing to enable them doesn\u2019t mean you have to shut them out entirely, and it doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re giving up on them. I told my brother not to talk to me until he\u2019d decided that he was done with all this and wanted out. I stepped back, but when he was seeking out help, I was right there ready to morally support him.\nMost importantly remember that it is not your job or responsibility to save them.
