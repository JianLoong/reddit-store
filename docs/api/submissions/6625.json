When you literally already know she's a drunk?  This is how the depressing, awful kind of AITA stories start.  Don't go there.  Don't enable her.\n\nHelp her if she knows she needs help.

Your plan was to be one of three people sharing housing, none of them a druggie/drunk. Now you're faced with being one of two people, the other of whom is a drunk.\n\nThat's a very big change for the worse and you are completely within your rights to back out.\n\nThat you care about her is great, but sharing your living space with a drunk, to the point of taking care of them - that's a lot. For instance, unless you really know what you're doing, one big danger is veering into enabling someone with a drinking problem, which isn't helpful for either you or them. \n\nAlso, think twice about the couch idea. If you're going to have a roommate, you're imposing your drinking friend not only on yourself, but on your roommate, and that's not OK.\n\nSecondly, my guess is that once they are on your couch it will be hard to get rid of them, and, guess what, you're just doing the \"living with the drunk\" thing again, but with extra steps.", "NTA.

You WILL DIE if you don't stay sober. \n\n2. Sobriety IS NOT the same as \"not drinking\".\n\n3. You CANNOT DRINK, EVER. Your body metabolises alcohol differently than a non-addict. Even one glass of wine, one sip os the beginning of an end.\n\n4. You THINK differently than a non-addict. That's why you need therapy and/or AA to change the way you even think.\n\n5. Your addiction is ruining your health, life, and those closest to you.\n\nAlcohol addiction is an illness, a terminal illness at that. You can never get rid of addiction even if you never drink again due to the changes that happened in your body already. You can only STOP the illness from further spreading and affecting your life.

If you\u2018re staying alone with her than it is possible that you are putting your mental health on line. It is possible that you will get along well with this situation but don\u2018t take this topic lightly. \nIt would be an asshole move if you would cut the contact from one day to another, since you\u2018re a person who is significant for her if i read it right. It would be good to have a talk with her. If it\u2018s too much of a burden for you, take another person with you. You don\u2018t have to do this alone. But a treatment is necessary and if you continue to live with her alone even though you are worried about this than it is possible that you put your mental health on line which should be the highest priority. \n\nTldr: NTA, but have a gentle talk with her the way she feels not left alone.

You can support her when she starts her journey to get help, but in order for her to get to that place, she's gonna need to feel the consequences of her actions.\n\nPlease don't offer her a place to crash for as long as she needs either, because when someone is taking care of her needs like that, she'll keep drinking.

It\u2019s a job better done by professionals tha by people like yourself who are young, inexperienced, and still learning to manage your own life - you aren\u2019t in an appropriate place to provide what she needs right now and that\u2019s neither your fault nor hers.", "NTA - I have friends in recovery and not once have they thanked anyone who helped enable them by letting them crash on the couch.
