{"id": 3825, "submission_id": "zb1wpw", "title": "AITA for not letting another man touch my wife?", "selftext": "  \n\nThrowaway.  \n We have some cool neighbors that we frequently hang out with, \u201cAllison\u201d and \u201cCarl\u201d (fake names). They are a little younger than us but their kids are a little older. They frequently have friends over and invite us to come hang out. They are genuinely really wonderful people and I really like hanging out with them as does my wife, and our daughter plays with their kids and their friends\u2019 kids. They are a polyamorous couple, which I make no judgement on because they are truly wonderful people. I\u2019m not sure who in their friend group is also poly but I am guessing some of them are.  \n My wife is currently pregnant with twins and has a pretty decent belly on her. Also, my wife is hot, which I think is relevant. We were hanging out yesterday and Carl asked my wife if he could touch her stomach. I said \u201cNo\u201d at which point Carl, my wife, Allison, and a few other people jerked their head at me. Carl told me to chill and my wife looked at me like she was upset and I realized I had made things awkward but I said \u201cI would really prefer if you didn\u2019t touch my wife.\u201d My wife said it\u2019s fine and no big deal and Carl said he just wanted to feel the babies. Allison said that it was up to my wife and not me. I said \u201cplease, no\u201d and they walked away to talk to another couple and left us standing there alone. We got our daughter and went home at that point. My wife is mad at me for making things awkward with Allison and Carl because they are super nice and she loves hanging out with Allison and doesn\u2019t want to lose that. I don\u2019t know if it weirded her out at all and she was just being nice, but I doubt I will get an honest answer because she\u2019s a very low-conflict person.  \n Now, I totally understand my wife is not my property or anything like that, but I wasn\u2019t comfortable with Carl putting his hand on her stomach. I agree that a pregnant woman\u2019s stomach is an absolutely beautiful and magical thing, but I would not be comfortable myself putting my hand on a friend\u2019s stomach. Obviously Carl has way different views on stuff like this since he lets other dudes rail his wife, but I feel like he should respect the fact that it makes me uncomfortable. I just think it\u2019s kind of creepy. I keep thinking of that senator guy that touched Betty\u2019s pregnant belly and ended up marrying her after she divorced Don Draper on Mad Men. Anyway I am really conflicted on this one. I don\u2019t want to upset my pregnant wife and lose out on our friendship with Carl and Allison, but at the same time I really don\u2019t want him to touch my wife\u2019s stomach. Hopefully this one awkward encounter will be the end of it and we can forget about it but if Carl tries to do it again I don\u2019t think I can be okay with it.

It isn't your stomach. She wasn't concerned. Touching a pregnant friend's belly isn't a sexual thing and, even if you start talking about breeding kinks,  people typically don't involve random friends in their kink without consent.\n\nThen there's this thinly veiled trash take on polyamory you've got going on. I won't lie, it kinda got my hackles up friend. See, not only have I felt the same 'everything is sexual/they're gonna hit on my SO' vibe just because I'm a bisexual, but I'm also polyamorous, myself. That shit paints us as predatory sexual deviants for existing and it's just *gross.* Poly people do understand monogamy and polyamory is not 'cheating with extra steps.' For a polycule of any kind or shape, a lot of communication and a thorough understanding of consent is vital. You seem to be struggling with understanding both here: your wife is communicating that you broke her consent by interfering and removing her choice after her *good friend* communicated and requested consent for a harmless, platonic action. You seem to think you have any say here based on groundless assumption and bias and 'but another man wanted to touch what's mine!'", ">I agree that a pregnant woman\u2019s stomach is an absolutely beautiful and magical thing, but I would not be comfortable myself putting my hand on a friend\u2019s stomach. Obviously Carl has way different views on stuff like this since he lets other dudes rail his wife\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to unpack here, but do you see how you directly compared touching someone\u2019s stomach to having sex? Touching another person\u2019s stomach is perhaps an intimate kind of touch in its way, but you\u2019re the only one here sexualizing it.\n\nThe primary reason YTA is because you completely steamrolled your wife on the subject of her own bodily autonomy.\n\nThe secondary reason is that it really does seem like you\u2019re assuming poly = having sexual feelings for absolutely anybody and everybody. If you were just uncomfortable with any dude touching your wife\u2019s stomach, then Carl\u2019s poly status would be irrelevant. I also saw you mentioned in another comment that you thought Carl might be getting some kind of \u201cperverse pleasure\u201d out of touching her stomach. You saw Carl\u2019s request as lecherous because you absolutely are judging him.", "YTA. Um, your weird insecurities are makings everyone uncomfortable. You are not your wife\u2019s keeper. Her body, her rules. If you don\u2019t like it, you can talk to her about it, but making a scene is downright embarrassing.", "Yta. First, The question was addressed to your wife. She should answer. Not you. Unless you are communicating  through looks or husband/wife telepathy and she is asking to be rescued, which wasn\u2019t the case here. \nSecond, the conversation about your comfort level is between you and your wife. Come to an agreement.   If she s fine and doesn\u2019t want to defer to your discomfort, perhaps remove yourself from the scene. \nAre you this way w all men, or just poly-Carl?", "YTA.\n\nUnless your wife was uncomfortable saying no and asked you to intervene on her behalf, you were out of line.  Your wife determines whether someone can touch her stomach, not you.  \n\nAnd it's obvious that your issues with your neighbors' lifestyle choices are causing you to make superhuman leaps over tall buildings to reach ridiculous conclusions as to motive.", "[deleted]", "YTA. Sounds like you\u2019re insecure because Carl \u201clet\u2019s other dudes rail his wife.\u201d He wasn\u2019t trying to \u2018rail\u2019 yours. He asked if he could feel her stomach and you felt the need to put him in his place. It was an innocent question a lot of people ask their friends.

Saying how things are or aren\u2019t doesn\u2019t negate your actions. \n\nCarl *asked* first and didn\u2019t just touch like a lot of people feel entitled to do. Whether or not that is ok is entirely up to the pregnant person, not her husband, father, or other friends or relations. You were way out of line. If, and only if your wife had said no and then Carl persisted would it be ok to step in and back her up. And by back her up I mean \u201cshe said no, let\u2019s respect that\u201d and not \u201cdon\u2019t touch my wife.\u201d\n\nYou need to do some introspection and then you owe a lot of people some sincere apologies.", "YTA.\n\n>I wasn\u2019t comfortable with Carl putting his hand on her stomach.  \n>  \n>I would not be comfortable myself putting my hand on a friend\u2019s stomach.  \n>  \n> I feel like he should respect the fact that it makes me uncomfortable.  \n>  \n>I just think it\u2019s kind of creepy.  \n>  \n>I keep thinking of that senator guy....  \n>  \n> I really don\u2019t want him to touch my wife\u2019s stomach.  \n>  \n> I don\u2019t think I can be okay with it.\n\nDo i need to keep going or explain why? For a second i really thought you were the one getting touched.", "YTA. You say polyamory is fine, but you use pejorative words and attitude to describe it. You say your wife's body belongs to her, but you want to dictate who can touch her gestating belly. You don't allow her to make the decision and you make it for her even after she expresses her preference.\n\nHopefully for their sake Carl and Allison are long gone.", "YTA it\u2019s up your wife not you who gets to touch her. You are coming off as territorial and jealous.  Mentioning they were a polyamorous added nothing to the story.  Further pushing the jealous/territorial concept.  \n\nJust because he touches **her** belly doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019ll enter a relationship with them.", ">They are a polyamorous couple, which I make no judgement on\n\nYou're lying to yourself. YTA. It's very clear that not only do you *absolutely* have a problem with it, but that you projected that issue onto a person wanting to feel your wife's pregnant belly.\n\nAnd for knowing she isn't your property, you're sure trying to impose your will, when she's totally fine with the normal act of someone feeling her stomach while pregnant.\n\nAlso, the fact that you keep thinking of what happened on a TV show like it's real is... weird.", "YTA, and I\u2019m pretty sure you know it.\n\n> I totally understand my wife is not my property or anything like that\n\nNo, dude, I don\u2019t think you do.  *She* gets to decide who\u2019s allowed to put their hand on *her* stomach.  Not you.  Period.  And your conviction that Carl and Allison being polyamorous means they\u2019re out to seduce everyone at all times (or at least everyone *you\u2019d* try and seduce if you weren\u2019t already in a monogamous relationship) is *your* problem.  Stop making it your wife\u2019s.", "Aww look at you being so judgy over other people's lives that don't concern you.\nIt's up to your wife to say who can and cannot touch her.\nCarl isn't 'letting' other dudes 'rail' his wife.

It\u2019s your hot, pregnant wife\u2019s call on whether she\u2019s comfortable allowing people to touch her pregnant belly. You made things awkward.

If she's comfortable with letting other people touch the baby bump, then build a bridge and get over your insecurities, my dude.\n\nEdit: Also you have no idea how polyamourous relationships work. Please educate yourself before you assume things like poly men let other men 'rail' their wives.  (So much for not being judgemental.)", "YTA. I think you are seriously overthinking this and overreacting to the situation. I don't get the vibe that Carl's intentions were creepy. I think he literally just was curious about the babies kicking.  Your wife was okay with it, it's her body and her choice. Obviously she wasn't getting the same vibes you seem to have. You made a scene for nothing and potentially damaged a good friendship. You are super fixated on their poly lifestyle and I find that disturbing. Just because he leads a different lifestyle than you doesn't mean he's a creep.", "YTA\n\nIt was entirely up to your wife to make that call. And I say this as a woman who can't stand to be touched by 95% of people and do not like touching pregnant bellies. You made things very awkward for everyone involved and potentially ruined your friendship because you publically embarrassed them.\n\nBy the way, saying you don't judge their life and then saying he \"let's other men rail his wife\" is very judgemental.

Do you think he's going to seduce your wife by feeling babies kick? Come on, man", "YTA - it\u2019s her body, not yours", "YTA. It\u2019s her body.

Your wife gets to pick who can and can't touch her, but I don't think you went full AH. Once she said it's OK, you should've backed down.

My husband did it well, but his friend is massive and could apply a lot more pressure.", "YTA but you know that. My question is, do you have a pregnancy kink that you were projecting onto Carl?", "YTA, and it sure sounds like you believe your wife is incapable of setting her own boundaries.", "YTA but just so I am clear: someone asked YOUR WIFE if they could touch HER stomach and you answered for her saying no. Without even considering how your wife felt about HER BODY being touched. And even after she said it\u2019s fine, you still insisted he not touch your wife. \nAnd then you insist you don\u2019t think your wife is your property\u2026 but you think you get to control her bodily autonomy?\n\nAlso the \u201che lets other guys rail his wife\u201d was a tell all.

My belly didn't get too big but my sister looked like she was stealing a basketball by 6 months.  So for her to have twins it would be extra on top of that.  You are assuming (and you know what happens when you assume) that Carl would get off ny touching her stomach.  1 do you? (Is that why you think he would?) 2 most ethical poly people don't try to trap people in their poly play (or whatever you ASSUME) would happen.\n\nHonestly, the best way to handle this situation is to be up front and have a 1 on 1 talk with Carl and say hey dude I f'd up here, you can explain to him that you don't know how to be friends with people who are different but you would like to try.", "YTA.

I think you need to really do some self reflection and find out why that is.

Your spouse is your partner, so I can kind of understand not wanting someone else to touch them, but you definitely went about it wrongly. You should have just let your wife answer, and do what she was comfortable with (especially since it is a very innocent thing, he wasn't trying to touch her breasts or something, he just wanted to feel the babies) and then afterwards privately tell her that it made you uncomfortable, and that you'd appreciate it if she said no to things like that in the future.

That\u2019s very creepy and uncomfortable, and while you correctly note that your wife is not your property\u2026 those are your dang kids and you get some say. (Personally, when I was pregnant I had no issue with family members on either side or of either sex touching my belly; that was perfectly innocent and normal. I was also fine with close female friends; any close male friends probably would\u2019ve been conditional. Casual friends or strangers were a hard pass.)", "YTA. She\u2019s not your property.

Yes OP's wife said it was ok, but I would never feel comfortable touching another person's wife, even just a baby bump, especially if the husband had an issue with it. It's just disrespectful and rude. How would OP's wife feel if Carol asked to feel OP's muscles? I bet she would be weirded out a bit.", "NTA  How would your wife feel if the situation was reversed? I mean you're not pregnant but what if, at a similar get-together, another women walks up to you and wants  you to flex your butt cheeks while she's holding on with both hands. Of course it's not a \n baby moving but it is awkward watching someone else touching your spouse. I don't think it makes you insecure or jealous, it sounds like your just being protective.

They are a little younger than us but their kids are a little older. They frequently have friends over and invite us to come hang out. They are genuinely really wonderful people and I really like hanging out with them as does my wife, and our daughter plays with their kids and their friends\u2019 kids. They are a polyamorous couple, which I make no judgement on because they are truly wonderful people. I\u2019m not sure who in their friend group is also poly but I am guessing some of them are.  \n My wife is currently pregnant with twins and has a pretty decent belly on her. Also, my wife is hot, which I think is relevant. We were hanging out yesterday and Carl asked my wife if he could touch her stomach. I said \u201cNo\u201d at which point Carl, my wife, Allison, and a few other people jerked their head at me. Carl told me to chill and my wife looked at me like she was upset and I realized I had made things awkward but I said \u201cI would really prefer if you didn\u2019t touch my wife.\u201d My wife said it\u2019s fine and no big deal and Carl said he just wanted to feel the babies. Allison said that it was up to my wife and not me. I said \u201cplease, no\u201d and they walked away to talk to another couple and left us standing there alone. We got our daughter and went home at that point. My wife is mad at me for making things awkward with Allison and Carl because they are super nice and she loves hanging out with Allison and doesn\u2019t want to lose that. I don\u2019t know if it weirded her out at all and she was just being nice, but I doubt I will get an honest answer because she\u2019s a very low-conflict person.  \n Now, I totally understand my wife is not my property or anything like that, but I wasn\u2019t comfortable with Carl putting his hand on her stomach. I agree that a pregnant woman\u2019s stomach is an absolutely beautiful and magical thing, but I would not be comfortable myself putting my hand on a friend\u2019s stomach. Obviously Carl has way different views on stuff like this since he lets other dudes rail his wife, but I feel like he should respect the fact that it makes me uncomfortable. I just think it\u2019s kind of creepy. I keep thinking of that senator guy that touched Betty\u2019s pregnant belly and ended up marrying her after she divorced Don Draper on Mad Men. Anyway I am really conflicted on this one. I don\u2019t want to upset my pregnant wife and lose out on our friendship with Carl and Allison, but at the same time I really don\u2019t want him to touch my wife\u2019s stomach. Hopefully this one awkward encounter will be the end of it and we can forget about it but if Carl tries to do it again I don\u2019t think I can be okay with it.

Then there's the fact that he referred to polyamory as \"he let's other men rail his wife\". Like who the fuck are you to say that. Polyamory is just different from what OP is used to. That doesn't mean the woman in a polyamorous relationship is getting \"railed\" with the permission of her husband. Like wtf ?? This statement made me so mad.
