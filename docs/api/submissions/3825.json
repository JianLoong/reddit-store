{"id": 3825, "submission_id": "zb1wpw", "title": "AITA for not letting another man touch my wife?", "selftext": "  \n\nThrowaway.  \n We have some cool neighbors that we frequently hang out with, \u201cAllison\u201d and \u201cCarl\u201d (fake names). They are a little younger than us but their kids are a little older. They frequently have friends over and invite us to come hang out. They are genuinely really wonderful people and I really like hanging out with them as does my wife, and our daughter plays with their kids and their friends\u2019 kids. They are a polyamorous couple, which I make no judgement on because they are truly wonderful people. I\u2019m not sure who in their friend group is also poly but I am guessing some of them are.  \n My wife is currently pregnant with twins and has a pretty decent belly on her. Also, my wife is hot, which I think is relevant. We were hanging out yesterday and Carl asked my wife if he could touch her stomach. I said \u201cNo\u201d at which point Carl, my wife, Allison, and a few other people jerked their head at me. Carl told me to chill and my wife looked at me like she was upset and I realized I had made things awkward but I said \u201cI would really prefer if you didn\u2019t touch my wife.\u201d My wife said it\u2019s fine and no big deal and Carl said he just wanted to feel the babies. Allison said that it was up to my wife and not me. I said \u201cplease, no\u201d and they walked away to talk to another couple and left us standing there alone. We got our daughter and went home at that point. My wife is mad at me for making things awkward with Allison and Carl because they are super nice and she loves hanging out with Allison and doesn\u2019t want to lose that. I don\u2019t know if it weirded her out at all and she was just being nice, but I doubt I will get an honest answer because she\u2019s a very low-conflict person.  \n Now, I totally understand my wife is not my property or anything like that, but I wasn\u2019t comfortable with Carl putting his hand on her stomach. I agree that a pregnant woman\u2019s stomach is an absolutely beautiful and magical thing, but I would not be comfortable myself putting my hand on a friend\u2019s stomach. Obviously Carl has way different views on stuff like this since he lets other dudes rail his wife, but I feel like he should respect the fact that it makes me uncomfortable. I just think it\u2019s kind of creepy. I keep thinking of that senator guy that touched Betty\u2019s pregnant belly and ended up marrying her after she divorced Don Draper on Mad Men. Anyway I am really conflicted on this one. I don\u2019t want to upset my pregnant wife and lose out on our friendship with Carl and Allison, but at the same time I really don\u2019t want him to touch my wife\u2019s stomach. Hopefully this one awkward encounter will be the end of it and we can forget about it but if Carl tries to do it again I don\u2019t think I can be okay with it.

It isn't your stomach. She wasn't concerned. Touching a pregnant friend's belly isn't a sexual thing and, even if you start talking about breeding kinks,  people typically don't involve random friends in their kink without consent.\n\nThen there's this thinly veiled trash take on polyamory you've got going on. I won't lie, it kinda got my hackles up friend. See, not only have I felt the same 'everything is sexual/they're gonna hit on my SO' vibe just because I'm a bisexual, but I'm also polyamorous, myself. That shit paints us as predatory sexual deviants for existing and it's just *gross.* Poly people do understand monogamy and polyamory is not 'cheating with extra steps.' For a polycule of any kind or shape, a lot of communication and a thorough understanding of consent is vital. You seem to be struggling with understanding both here: your wife is communicating that you broke her consent by interfering and removing her choice after her *good friend* communicated and requested consent for a harmless, platonic action. You seem to think you have any say here based on groundless assumption and bias and 'but another man wanted to touch what's mine!'", ">I agree that a pregnant woman\u2019s stomach is an absolutely beautiful and magical thing, but I would not be comfortable myself putting my hand on a friend\u2019s stomach. Obviously Carl has way different views on stuff like this since he lets other dudes rail his wife\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to unpack here, but do you see how you directly compared touching someone\u2019s stomach to having sex? Touching another person\u2019s stomach is perhaps an intimate kind of touch in its way, but you\u2019re the only one here sexualizing it.\n\nThe primary reason YTA is because you completely steamrolled your wife on the subject of her own bodily autonomy.\n\nThe secondary reason is that it really does seem like you\u2019re assuming poly = having sexual feelings for absolutely anybody and everybody. If you were just uncomfortable with any dude touching your wife\u2019s stomach, then Carl\u2019s poly status would be irrelevant. I also saw you mentioned in another comment that you thought Carl might be getting some kind of \u201cperverse pleasure\u201d out of touching her stomach. You saw Carl\u2019s request as lecherous because you absolutely are judging him.", "YTA. Um, your weird insecurities are makings everyone uncomfortable. You are not your wife\u2019s keeper. Her body, her rules. If you don\u2019t like it, you can talk to her about it, but making a scene is downright embarrassing.", "Yta. First, The question was addressed to your wife. She should answer. Not you. Unless you are communicating  through looks or husband/wife telepathy and she is asking to be rescued, which wasn\u2019t the case here. \nSecond, the conversation about your comfort level is between you and your wife. Come to an agreement.   If she s fine and doesn\u2019t want to defer to your discomfort, perhaps remove yourself from the scene. \nAre you this way w all men, or just poly-Carl?", "YTA.\n\nUnless your wife was uncomfortable saying no and asked you to intervene on her behalf, you were out of line.  Your wife determines whether someone can touch her stomach, not you.  \n\nAnd it's obvious that your issues with your neighbors' lifestyle choices are causing you to make superhuman leaps over tall buildings to reach ridiculous conclusions as to motive.", "YTA. \n\n> Now, I totally understand my wife is not my property or anything like that,\n\nNot sure you do!", "YTA. Sounds like you\u2019re insecure because Carl \u201clet\u2019s other dudes rail his wife.\u201d He wasn\u2019t trying to \u2018rail\u2019 yours. He asked if he could feel her stomach and you felt the need to put him in his place. It was an innocent question a lot of people ask their friends. If your wife was okay with it then I don\u2019t see the problem? Also \u201cnow I understand my wife is not my property or anything BUT..\u201d but what my guy?", "YTA. \n\nYou totally judged Carl for being poly and you are acting like you think you have the right to speak for \u201cyour wife\u201d (you referred to her several times as if she were a possession or object when you could have given her a pseudonym too). Saying how things are or aren\u2019t doesn\u2019t negate your actions. \n\nCarl *asked* first and didn\u2019t just touch like a lot of people feel entitled to do. Whether or not that is ok is entirely up to the pregnant person, not her husband, father, or other friends or relations. You were way out of line. If, and only if your wife had said no and then Carl persisted would it be ok to step in and back her up. And by back her up I mean \u201cshe said no, let\u2019s respect that\u201d and not \u201cdon\u2019t touch my wife.\u201d\n\nYou need to do some introspection and then you owe a lot of people some sincere apologies.", "YTA.\n\n>I wasn\u2019t comfortable with Carl putting his hand on her stomach.  \n>  \n>I would not be comfortable myself putting my hand on a friend\u2019s stomach.  \n>  \n> I feel like he should respect the fact that it makes me uncomfortable.  \n>  \n>I just think it\u2019s kind of creepy.  \n>  \n>I keep thinking of that senator guy....  \n>  \n> I really don\u2019t want him to touch my wife\u2019s stomach.  \n>  \n> I don\u2019t think I can be okay with it.\n\nDo i need to keep going or explain why? For a second i really thought you were the one getting touched.", "YTA. You say polyamory is fine, but you use pejorative words and attitude to describe it. You say your wife's body belongs to her, but you want to dictate who can touch her gestating belly. You don't allow her to make the decision and you make it for her even after she expresses her preference.\n\nHopefully for their sake Carl and Allison are long gone.", "YTA it\u2019s up your wife not you who gets to touch her. You are coming off as territorial and jealous.  Mentioning they were a polyamorous added nothing to the story.  Further pushing the jealous/territorial concept.  \n\nJust because he touches **her** belly doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019ll enter a relationship with them.", ">They are a polyamorous couple, which I make no judgement on\n\nYou're lying to yourself. YTA. It's very clear that not only do you *absolutely* have a problem with it, but that you projected that issue onto a person wanting to feel your wife's pregnant belly.\n\nAnd for knowing she isn't your property, you're sure trying to impose your will, when she's totally fine with the normal act of someone feeling her stomach while pregnant.\n\nAlso, the fact that you keep thinking of what happened on a TV show like it's real is... weird.", "YTA, and I\u2019m pretty sure you know it.\n\n> I totally understand my wife is not my property or anything like that\n\nNo, dude, I don\u2019t think you do.  *She* gets to decide who\u2019s allowed to put their hand on *her* stomach.  Not you.  Period.  And your conviction that Carl and Allison being polyamorous means they\u2019re out to seduce everyone at all times (or at least everyone *you\u2019d* try and seduce if you weren\u2019t already in a monogamous relationship) is *your* problem.  Stop making it your wife\u2019s.", "Aww look at you being so judgy over other people's lives that don't concern you.\nIt's up to your wife to say who can and cannot touch her.\nCarl isn't 'letting' other dudes 'rail' his wife. They made a choice for their relationship. \nYTA.", "It\u2019s clear that you do view your wife as your property. She was fine with it and you stepped on what she said was ok for HER BODY. Hers. Not yours. YTA.", "YTA. \n\n\n>Now, I totally understand my wife is not my property or anything like that,\n\nSo you don't get to decide for her who touches her. You are free to discuss your feelings on the subject with her, but she has the final word.\n\nI can't help but wonder if you didn't know that Carl was poly whether you would have reacted the way you did.", "YTA. It\u2019s your hot, pregnant wife\u2019s call on whether she\u2019s comfortable allowing people to touch her pregnant belly. You made things awkward. Plus, telling us about the scene from Mad Men is pointless. You have some apologizing to do. Overriding  her consent is wrong.", ">I would not be comfortable myself putting my hand on a friend\u2019s stomach.

YTA not your body not your call, doesn't matter if that body is married to you or not.", "Controlling issues much? YTA here, \"Mad Man\"\n\nYour wife was the one to decide and answer that. Your snap reaction was overreaction and frankly misogynistic.\n\nClearly, you have judgemental issues about their lifestyle. That's a topic and conversation WITH YOUR WIFE at another time.\n\nYou acted incredibly insecure and rude not trusting your wife's own opinion and decision.", "yta for someone who doesn\u2019t care about there lifestyle you keep bringing it up so you must care about it a little bit\u2026 your wife\u2019s body is your wife\u2019s body if she was okay with it then you shouldn\u2019t have made something innocent into something weird. a lot of people like to feel women\u2019s pregnant belly\u2019s they think it\u2019s cool to feel baby kick.. it\u2019s only weird if they are obsessive about it or the mother doesn\u2019t want it and they make her uncomfortable. you made a mountain out of a mole hill.", "Bro, I can\u2019t even tell you how many people go in for the \u2018the touch\u2019 of a pregnant woman\u2019s stomach without asking. The fact that he asked shows respect for you. I could understand if you weren\u2019t cool with men in general but it seems you\u2019re afraid their polyamorous lifestyle is a condition caught by contact.", "YTA and you\u2019re the one being creepy about this. you are using the fact the other couple is poly as an excuse to sexualize something not even remotely sexual that is considered extremely normal for people who are close with the pregnant person to do. and even though you have \u201cno problem\u201d with their lifestyle you had to add in the low blow about \u201cother dudes railing his wife\u201d let\u2019s not pretend you didn\u2019t fully intend that as an insult. this whole post screams insecure.", "YTA\n\ngrow the fuck up\n\nknew you were garbage when you said \"mY wIfE iS hOt\"", "YTA. If it\u2019s ok with your wife, then you\u2019re just going to have to deal with it. Just because he\u2019s poly doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s some kind of uncontrollable rapist. He asked for consent-HER consent, as it should be.", "Oof. YTA.  Your wife gets to make that decision, not you.  If she's comfortable with letting other people touch the baby bump, then build a bridge and get over your insecurities, my dude.\n\nEdit: Also you have no idea how polyamourous relationships work. Please educate yourself before you assume things like poly men let other men 'rail' their wives.  (So much for not being judgemental.)", "YTA. I think you are seriously overthinking this and overreacting to the situation. I don't get the vibe that Carl's intentions were creepy. I think he literally just was curious about the babies kicking.  Your wife was okay with it, it's her body and her choice. Obviously she wasn't getting the same vibes you seem to have. You made a scene for nothing and potentially damaged a good friendship. You are super fixated on their poly lifestyle and I find that disturbing. Just because he leads a different lifestyle than you doesn't mean he's a creep.", "YTA\n\nIt was entirely up to your wife to make that call. And I say this as a woman who can't stand to be touched by 95% of people and do not like touching pregnant bellies. You made things very awkward for everyone involved and potentially ruined your friendship because you publically embarrassed them.\n\nBy the way, saying you don't judge their life and then saying he \"let's other men rail his wife\" is very judgemental. Guess what? His wife makes a decision on who she wants to have a sexual encounter with. Just as your wife can decide who can touch her stomach. Do you think he's going to seduce your wife by feeling babies kick? Come on, man", "YTA - it\u2019s her body, not yours", "YTA. It\u2019s her body. And the comment about how Carl let\u2019s other dudes \u201crail\u201d his wife is insanely judgemental and irrelevant to this situation.", "YTA it's your wife's decision.

SHE decides who touches her body, not you.", "YTA. It's her body. NOT yours. Let her deal with it.", "YTA. It's absolutely up to your wife and not you. It sounds like you might have some prejudice/assumptions about poly people you should address. I could be wrong but that's what it sounds like.

You may need to assess where these concerns come from, whether its polyphobia, chauvinism, your own insecurities, etc.", "YTA your wife can make her own decisions", "I mean it's a bit possessive. Your wife gets to pick who can and can't touch her, but I don't think you went full AH. Once she said it's OK, you should've backed down.

Your wife is an adult she can handle it.", "YTA and insecure as hell. My husband's male friend used to lift my belly (which feels awesome when you're super pregnant). My husband did it well, but his friend is massive and could apply a lot more pressure.", "YTA but you know that. My question is, do you have a pregnancy kink that you were projecting onto Carl?", "YTA, and it sure sounds like you believe your wife is incapable of setting her own boundaries.", "YTA but just so I am clear: someone asked YOUR WIFE if they could touch HER stomach and you answered for her saying no. Without even considering how your wife felt about HER BODY being touched. And even after she said it\u2019s fine, you still insisted he not touch your wife. \nAnd then you insist you don\u2019t think your wife is your property\u2026 but you think you get to control her bodily autonomy?\n\nAlso the \u201che lets other guys rail his wife\u201d was a tell all. You\u2019re insecure.

You also have no idea if his motivations were sexual..lots of people like to feel babies kick..it could of been very innocent and you sexualized it.", "YTA and this doesn\u2019t have anything to do with them being poly. you seem to think he touches her belly for a second and then they immediately get down and fuck? this was absolutely not your question to answer, hence when it wasn\u2019t asked to you! if this is a really strong boundary for you it should be discussed in private with you and your wife, not imposed in public like that. but honestly i can\u2019t believe that no one else has ever asked to touch your wife\u2019s belly when pregnant so if it was simply an issue with that then i think it would\u2019ve come up before. it\u2019s sounds to me like you\u2019re jealous or worried about your neighbours polyamory \u2018infiltrating\u2019 your relationship/carl overstepping/your wife cheating on you which is all really weird considering they\u2019re your good friends. you sound like a controlling and insecure dick and now everyone else thinks so too lol", "YTA - your wife isn\u2019t your property.

Let her answer for herself.", "All these YTA here better not get mad when your significant other flirts with and fondles other people or you\u2019re hippocrates. Anyone that thinks that request is normal is a weirdo and if your wife wants to let some other dude feel her stomach, she probably wants to do more. Can\u2019t stop her, but don\u2019t have to stay married to her either.", "So I tried to reread to get how pregnant your wife was, but not important really... honestly growing a human is weird and super cool.  My belly didn't get too big but my sister looked like she was stealing a basketball by 6 months.  So for her to have twins it would be extra on top of that.  You are assuming (and you know what happens when you assume) that Carl would get off ny touching her stomach.  1 do you? (Is that why you think he would?) 2 most ethical poly people don't try to trap people in their poly play (or whatever you ASSUME) would happen.\n\nHonestly, the best way to handle this situation is to be up front and have a 1 on 1 talk with Carl and say hey dude I f'd up here, you can explain to him that you don't know how to be friends with people who are different but you would like to try.", "YTA. The only person whose consent is needed is your wife. It\u2019s her body.", "YTA. For saying that you don't think of your wife as a possession, you sure acted like it, and kept on doubling down. That's toxic ownership behavior right there.\n\nIt's up to HER if she lets ANYONE touch her belly. NOT YOU!\n\nI don't know why *anyone* wants to touch a pregnant belly. It's gross to me, but I guess a lot of people thinking feeling the baby kick is neat.

You need to trust her, and trust that she loves you and is not out to get into anything weird with your neighbour. It\u2019s her belly and if she is ok with someone feeling it you need to let her have her space to make that decision, and you need to trust her.\n\nHowever, from your reaction and explanation it\u2019s clear this makes you uncomfortable. I think you need to really do some self reflection and find out why that is. I think your reaction was unwarranted but it sounds like there\u2019s a fear, insecurity or something there that needs to be brought up and worked on, so for that i say soft YTA because I don\u2019t think this reaction came from a mean place.", "YTA but I can kind of understand sort of. Your spouse is your partner, so I can kind of understand not wanting someone else to touch them, but you definitely went about it wrongly. You should have just let your wife answer, and do what she was comfortable with (especially since it is a very innocent thing, he wasn't trying to touch her breasts or something, he just wanted to feel the babies) and then afterwards privately tell her that it made you uncomfortable, and that you'd appreciate it if she said no to things like that in the future. Of course, you'd have to respect her decision about whether or not she'd agree of course.", "\"Obviously Carl has way different views on stuff like this since he lets other dudes rail his wife.\" LOL.

THIS IS NOT YOUR DECISION TO MAKE.**", "WOOOOOWWWWWWWW, I\u2019ll actually give you a big ole NTA on this one. That\u2019s very creepy and uncomfortable, and while you correctly note that your wife is not your property\u2026 those are your dang kids and you get some say. (Personally, when I was pregnant I had no issue with family members on either side or of either sex touching my belly; that was perfectly innocent and normal. I was also fine with close female friends; any close male friends probably would\u2019ve been conditional. Casual friends or strangers were a hard pass.)", "YTA. She\u2019s not your property.

If something makes you uncomfortable as her partner, she should listen with open ears. Same for you. \n\nBut who trumps who? \n\nPhysical touch is something that I am not comfortable with, in terms of dh. But it was a greater conversation with one another, at length. \n\nSo voice your concerns and help her to understand what you are feeling.

Recognize that there are high emotions. And work on it. \n\nMarriage takes work.", "NTA. Your wife's body is hers. She is carrying your children, though. It's tough to walk a thin line, but you were being protective of your family. That is your right, nothing else needs said.", "I mean, no man should be touching a woman's belly period. And if it made my husband uncomfortable as his wife and partner, I would respect that. Yes, my body is my choice, but he's my spouse, and if it makes him uncomfortable, then no means no. Why is it we always allow woman to getaway with this crap but if a wife says, Please don't hug my husband or kiss him on the cheek, she's allowed those feelings.\" But a man is not?", "A bit of both.

It's not like the babies were kicking and OP's wife wanted everyone to feel, but then OP had an issue with just Carl. Also the fact that they are poly could also be a factor. Yes OP's wife said it was ok, but I would never feel comfortable touching another person's wife, even just a baby bump, especially if the husband had an issue with it. It's just disrespectful and rude. How would OP's wife feel if Carol asked to feel OP's muscles? I bet she would be weirded out a bit.", "NTA  How would your wife feel if the situation was reversed? I mean you're not pregnant but what if, at a similar get-together, another women walks up to you and wants  you to flex your butt cheeks while she's holding on with both hands. Of course it's not a \n baby moving but it is awkward watching someone else touching your spouse. I don't think it makes you insecure or jealous, it sounds like your just being protective.

They are a little younger than us but their kids are a little older. They frequently have friends over and invite us to come hang out. They are genuinely really wonderful people and I really like hanging out with them as does my wife, and our daughter plays with their kids and their friends\u2019 kids. They are a polyamorous couple, which I make no judgement on because they are truly wonderful people. I\u2019m not sure who in their friend group is also poly but I am guessing some of them are.  \n My wife is currently pregnant with twins and has a pretty decent belly on her. Also, my wife is hot, which I think is relevant. We were hanging out yesterday and Carl asked my wife if he could touch her stomach. I said \u201cNo\u201d at which point Carl, my wife, Allison, and a few other people jerked their head at me. Carl told me to chill and my wife looked at me like she was upset and I realized I had made things awkward but I said \u201cI would really prefer if you didn\u2019t touch my wife.\u201d My wife said it\u2019s fine and no big deal and Carl said he just wanted to feel the babies. Allison said that it was up to my wife and not me. I said \u201cplease, no\u201d and they walked away to talk to another couple and left us standing there alone. We got our daughter and went home at that point. My wife is mad at me for making things awkward with Allison and Carl because they are super nice and she loves hanging out with Allison and doesn\u2019t want to lose that. I don\u2019t know if it weirded her out at all and she was just being nice, but I doubt I will get an honest answer because she\u2019s a very low-conflict person.  \n Now, I totally understand my wife is not my property or anything like that, but I wasn\u2019t comfortable with Carl putting his hand on her stomach. I agree that a pregnant woman\u2019s stomach is an absolutely beautiful and magical thing, but I would not be comfortable myself putting my hand on a friend\u2019s stomach. Obviously Carl has way different views on stuff like this since he lets other dudes rail his wife, but I feel like he should respect the fact that it makes me uncomfortable. I just think it\u2019s kind of creepy. I keep thinking of that senator guy that touched Betty\u2019s pregnant belly and ended up marrying her after she divorced Don Draper on Mad Men. Anyway I am really conflicted on this one. I don\u2019t want to upset my pregnant wife and lose out on our friendship with Carl and Allison, but at the same time I really don\u2019t want him to touch my wife\u2019s stomach. Hopefully this one awkward encounter will be the end of it and we can forget about it but if Carl tries to do it again I don\u2019t think I can be okay with it.

He and his wife aren\u2019t monogamous so I think I\u2019d also think perhaps Carl WANTS to touch your wife. Judging by him being married and polyamorous, he thinks marriage is no reason for him not to pursue someone. I\u2019d be worried he had alternate intentions and was perfectly ok with tarnishing a marriage", "OP, I understand your response. These are people that think trading partners is no big deal. I wouldn't want any of them touching my partner either, no matter what the circumstance. NTA.", "NTA If he wants to feel baby bump they could make another d. It is fucking creepy even suggesting it.", "NTA\n\nYall are fucking weird here lmao. Neighbor is a weirdo for wanting to touch your wife. You also need to talk to your wife since that makes you uncomfortable and that should be that.", "Honestly OP is being super offensive towards everyone in this situation. His wife can speak for herself and decide for herself. It's her belly. Then, OP completely trashes Carl and Alice or Allison (I don't remember the fake name but you get the point) by assuming that simply touching a belly will make the man want to steal, marry and sleep with OP's pregnant wife, which I'm not sure if OP gets, but his wife has to consent to and if he's that scared his wife will consent then that opens up an entirely different can of worms. Then there's the fact that he referred to polyamory as \"he let's other men rail his wife\". Like who the fuck are you to say that. Polyamory is just different from what OP is used to. That doesn't mean the woman in a polyamorous relationship is getting \"railed\" with the permission of her husband. Like wtf ?? This statement made me so mad. If anything neighbor Carl was waaayy more respectful to OP's wife than he was and certainly way more descent as a person. Women are not property. OP made things weird and I hope his wife realized how wrong OP's views are so she can drop him.", "Right? The whole backstory about the neighbours being poly is completely irrelevant here, so to me it's obvious that he does judge them for that.", "Why does OP even bring up that they're polyamourous? Literally has nothing to do with the situation and no bearing on whether or not someone should touch his wife's pregnancy belly. OP is a judgemental AH for bringing it up at all. It's his wife's decision who touches her and who doesn't, nothing at all to do with him, or how \"hot\" the wife is.\n\nYTA for policing your wife's body", "For the sake of the argument if he'd had asked to have sex with OP's wife would you have responded the same way? I.e. your wife determines whether someone can have sex with her not you.\n\nWhat you have said is true but is he not allowed to express his discomfort?\n\nOP was not comfortable with it. He let everyone know that. He might have expressed it better.", "Oh man, I didn't catch that he didn't even give his wife a fake name but I did notice the way he dismissed her as \"non-confrontational\" and how he needed to come here to get the truth from people who know better.", "Literally. He said \u201cNow I totally understand my wife is not my property or anything like that\u201d\n\nI really don\u2019t think he does. YTA.", "I don\u2019t think OP understands women not being property of men. He refers to neighbor\u2019s wife as property of neighbor. \n\n\u201cHe lets other dudes rail his wife\u201d \n\nLike bruh being in a poly relationship is a two yes - one no situation.  Otherwise it\u2019s cheating. Also maybe Carl is getting railed too.", "I bet hes uncomfortable around gay men because they all \"want him\" too", "Allllll of this! As a former pregnant person (times three) and as a polyamorous person I agree 100%!! It\u2019s not just about \u201cgetting railed\u201d by other people\u2019s husbands. Sometimes it\u2019s their boyfriend. Or girlfriend. Or sometimes it\u2019s just lying in bed cuddling. Or reading together. It\u2019s having another relationship. If someone is going to judge the f out of something like OP did, he should know about it first. \n\nOP, YTA.", "A bit possessive? Wtf?!", "One is sexual and the other isn't. There's your missing nuance that makes your comment completely irrelevant", "If she has a hard time saying no to things like that but genuinely wants to,\nA) You two really need to discuss that, and\nB) Set up a signal ahead of time (in general) where she can flash you a look or request for help\n\nBut that's completely her choice.", "Poly people are usually MORE aware of bodily autonomy and the need to explicitly ask permission. Same with BDSM people.", "Personally, I think it a bit rude to ask.\nBut perhaps that's just me.", "Who knows, maybe Allison \u201clets\u201d other dudes rail her husband \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f But that thought might break OP completely", "He can have boundaries over his own body,  not anyone else's.", "They aren\u2019t his boundaries because it isn\u2019t his body. His wife gets to set her own boundaries for her own body.", "He can to his wife. It's not a boundary between him and other men on wheather or not to touch his wife as if she was his property. It's a boundary between him and his wife on whether she will allow others to touch her. \n\nNot to answer instead of her and before he set the boundary.", "I don\u2019t disagree but the appropriate thing to do would be to have that conversation in private with his wife. What he did was rude and infantilizing.", "Easier to understand for me when they name by the relationship vs multiple names\u2026already had to scroll up to confirm Allison was the neighbor\u2026 the names are irrelevant to the story IMO.", "You also said that Carl \"lets other men rail his wife\". The vibe you give is 100% men own their wifes.", "I actually don't think you need to talk about it at all, I think you need to take action on your own part, apologise to the neighbours for being a controlling judgemental duck, and stop policing your wife's body, regardless of your thoughts on the subject.", "eeew this is such a weird comment. \n\n>If he spent 5 minutes rubbing her belly and moaning would that change your answer?\n\nyes. that would change everyone's answers because that's a completely different situation than what happened.\n\nI assume if you shake a work colleague's hand upon meeting you don't find that terribly inappropriate or creepy or weird, right? But if you shook someone's hand and they held onto your hand for 5 minutes, rubbing it and moaning, then you'd be like \"what the fuck.\" Right? Because you see that added imaginary detail would make literally any social interaction weird, right? \n\nJFC. You clearly have a problem with Carl and assume he is sexually attracted to your wife. You haven't provided any evidence that I've seen that this concern is valid. The poly thing does not actually justify your jealous territorial weirdness.", "Why are you sexualising your wife's pregnant belly?", "But that\u2019s not what he did??? You are really hellbent on making Carl look like a perv here when in reality it is YOU who are sexualizing the entire situation.", "See, this is where you get misogynistic. Carl encourages OTHER DUDES to rail his wife. It's not even that Carl encourages his WIFE. It's other dudes. As if she is his property and he can decide what's going to happen to her.\n\nThe same this with your wife. It's all the same mindset.", "LOL Carl views and respects his wife as her own person who can make her own decisions in a mutually agreed upon arrangement. YOU on the other hand, view your wife and women as sexual possessions no other men are allowed to touch and are super disrespectful to and about other women and men that are okay with their Lerner people their own person. Super fucking sexist.", "Is this the part where you tuck yourself into the cold side of your king bed and fall asleep chuckling about how all the reddit hipsters were \"triggered\" by your traditional values?", "Disgusting. You just sexualized your baby and pregnant wife\u2019s belly. What\u2019s wrong with you?", "Congratulations on searching for comments that agree with you pov and learning fuck all from this experience. YTA.", "Dude, you're being gross.", "Happy cake day!", "Yeah unfortunately not a lot of people have that xD", "This!", "It is bonus points - women are equally guilty of this. When you\u2019re pregnant, complete strangers think it\u2019s perfectly acceptable to touch your belly.", "So someone should just touch without asking? Or did I misunderstand?", "Maybe he needs to set those boundaries then with his wife.  It's like the husband asking a woman to feel her augmented brests.", "What are you, a dog? You might as well have peed all over your wife to assert your territory from other alphas. \n\nAlso lmao how are you so sure he\u2019s the one letting guys rail his wife and not his wife letting other guys rail him? Do you happen to be one of these guys?", "Listen I get it. Your baby\u2019s in there. It feels very personal and intimate to you and seeing another man touch your wife\u2019s pregnant belly makes you uncomfortable. There\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with that. Maybe you never realized you felt this way but now that you know, it\u2019s imperative that you talk to your wife and, eventually Carl. Your wife can either agree to hold this boundary for you or not, that\u2019s her right. I think you need to apologize to Carl and let him know that you\u2019d never been in that situation before and didn\u2019t realize how uncomfortable you\u2019d be to have another man\u2019s hands on your wife\u2019s belly. Understand that you were harsh/rude. Also, do some introspection on how much of their lifestyle played a role in your discomfort and think about whether or not you can really be a friend to these people.", "How is touching a pregnant belly in any way like grabbing a dick??? Also Carl wasn't moaning, that's a hypothetical scenario OP came up with... as in 'should I still be ok with it if he was moaning'.", "Your reading comprehension skills are clearly lacking, my man. The \"moaning\" situation was just an imaginary scenario OP pulled out of his ass, not something that actually happened.", "If that happened, sure be upset. Doesn\u2019t mean you control your partners response. If your partner is ok and you\u2019re not.. maybe not a good fit.", "Plenty of us men think he's the AH too.", "I hope they are also able to remain friends with OP\u2019s wife. She seems nice.", "That's perverse to this guy who calls everyone in this story by a fake name except for \"his beautiful wife\" and references Mad Men for relationship advice.", "People are unbelievable. My daughter actually slapped away a woman\u2019s hand when the woman reached out to touch my infant granddaughter in a store. \n\nOP, YTA. Your discomfort with this scenario should be a private conversation with your wife. But ultimately it\u2019s her body and her decision.", "I would have turned and said I'm not pregnant and glared xD", ">Unfortunately a lot of ~~men~~ people feel totally comfortable doing this ~~if they have a friendly relationship with the pregnant person~~ regardless of whether they know the person or not. So it shouldn\u2019t be bonus points but realistically it kinda is.\n\nFTFY", "Indeed you did misunderstand.\n\nTouching without asking is dreadful.\n\nBut I don't think anyone should even ask with the possible exception of close family or very close friends.", "Touching a woman\u2019s breasts and touching her pregnant belly are clearly two very different things, and either way, in both cases, the person whose permission is needed is the woman\u2019s not her husband\u2019s.", "\u201cNo partner will change their boundaries about their body\u201d\nStrong disagree.

If so take this issue up with her directly because there is a problem between the two of you.\n\nAssuming she did not consent to the ass-grabbing, then that person has assaulted your wife and you reacting to that is not unreasonable.\n\nNeither of these hypothetical situations are actually relevant to a friend wanting to feel your wife's baby bump and asking for her permission first though. but nice try.", "He didn't grab anything; he asked her if he could touch her belly. You're the one making weird leaps.", "Because one is sexual assault and one is asking for consent to touch her in a completely non sexual way!!

Your wife doesn't have to apply the same rules to herself.\n\nB) That is a stupid comparison. Someone asking to feel your pecs is flirty. Someone asking a pregnant woman if they can touch her belly is respectful and the desire to do it is simply fascination with something natural.\n\nC) You keep saying you believe in bodily autonomy but you don't. The fact that you answered for your wife shows you think you have a say. The fact that you're still justifying it by saying you 'feel weird' means you still think other people are responsible for looking after your feelings.\n\nD) You say you won't get a straight answer from her. Then accept an indirect answer. She was upset. That means she's not happy with what you did. She doesn't NEED to say it out loud and you shouldn't make her.", "If someone respectfully and non-flirtily asked to feel the results of your workout routine out of genuine fascination and curiosity, then no, your wife doesn't get final say - you do. She can come to you later and tell you she felt insecure or uncomfortable or possessive and you both can process that however you want - make agreements or boundaries for her or you can assert that you understand how she feels but it's *your body*, you're comfortable with it and trustworthy, so you can help her process but you're under no obligation to refrain from doing what you want with your body inside the confines of your relationship agreement.", "I sincerely doubt that any neighbor women are looking to touch your pecs, but with all these comments digging you deeper into the same hole I really don't think there's anything I can say about your attitude that would fit this community's guidelines on politeness.", "I think the guy who let *\"other dudes rail his wife\"* has more notion of body autonomy, respect and consent than OP. What an irony."]}
