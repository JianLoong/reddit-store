I have been with my husband for 24 years and married 19 of them. We have three kids ages 17, 13, and 9.

He's a very active child and spends most of his time at school or out with friends, this never bothers me since he tells me who he's out with and when he'll be getting home. A few weeks ago my boss announced we broke our latest sales record so he would be taking us all out to dinner on Friday the 31st. We were all pretty excited since we don't do the typical \"team building\" excursions that other jobs hold. I had informed my husband of this but he has a very bad memory, I'm convinced he'd lose his head if it weren't attached to his body. Well, Friday came and we all went to dinner straight from work at a local Chinese buffet, as time passed everyone had their fill and left. By the time I left, it was only my boss and me. He thanked me for my hard work as he had done with my other coworkers and we went our separate ways for the night. When I got home I knew something was wrong. When I entered the living room I was face to face with my oldest pacing the room and my husband sitting on the couch with my other kids hugging him and crying.

I would've called another one of my coworkers but my son said something I could never forget. He said, \"So you don't even deny it? I can't believe my mom is a slut.\" I snapped and screamed in his face that he had no idea what he was insinuating and that was far from the truth, that I never accused him of terrible things when I found out he'd done wrong.

It doesn\u2019t matter if he forgot you had a dinner with workmates, doesn\u2019t he trust you?  And even if he did think something was off, it was not okay to have your kids involved. I understand why it might be hard for you to get past that. I know it would be hard for me to forgive the complete lack of trust. \n\nYour son\u2019s behavior was also awful. I hope you can get past your anger use this moment to teach him some life lessons. As bad as he\u2019s behaved he\u2019s 17 and they don\u2019t always have the best judgement. Talking to him while you are calm and making sure he understands that he should never jump to conclusions. That He should choose his words carefully, and that apologizing isn\u2019t enough at times. He needs to demonstrate to you that he has learned and grown from this experience. He should also be punished for his words and actions. Take away his electronics for 30 days or give him chores to do.\n\nEdited to add: find out how they got that picture. Whoever took that meant to harm you and you need to know.", "NTA. Your son has no respect for you (or for women, maybe?). I'm not sure just an apology is enough here, but I don't know how to bring that lesson home more effectively. \n\nDon't cut off your younger two. They are innocents here.", "NTA- I would be extremely hurt too, I can\u2019t believe they would think that of you. EVEN IF you were just out with your boss, that still could have just been business??? Insane", "NTA, although the fact that your husband seemed to not give you benefit of the doubt before discussing it with you is disconcerting, given the amount of time you've been together. Is there some underlying insecurity you might need to address with him, OP?\n\nHopefully your son has learned a lesson in how hurtful words can be, along with the dangers of making assumptions. Deep breaths, and wish you the best.", "NTA - teach your kids to stay out of grown folks business. Shame on your husband for involving the young ones and creating trauma instead of showing your hot headed 17 year old how a grown man is supposed to handle a sensitive situation. \n\nWhat kind of father is he letting his 17 year old take control of this whole drama? What a weak man. No wonder his son is running amok. He\u2019s got no real male role model in the home.", "NTA. I would\u2019ve been furious too. Hopefully this teaches your son about the danger of assumptions. This could have been handled differently. He could have approached you first, he could have curiously inquired what you did tonight. \n\nHe\u2019s old enough to realize the consequences of throwing accusations at people.", "NTA. I actually find your son jumping to conclusions more forgiveable than your husband not defending you. Unless you were kissing your boss in the photo, there's literally NO excuse for it. \n\nTake your time, and let them sweat it out while you chill down and relax. And then consider therapy to help you get past it. And consequences for what your son said. Regardless of what he thought was happening, what he said was hurtful, disrespectful and cruel and shouldn't be allowed to slide without consequences. \n\nI am inclined to say I wouldn't throw away my marriage over this misunderstanding, but my husband would have to work damn hard for forgiveness and earning back my trust if it were me.", "NTA \n\n17 is definitely a difficult age, however it is not young enough that he doesn't know better. He knew what he was saying and he didn't care, all he thought was that you did something that will destroy the family, and instead of asking he just decided to go into your home and announce it to everyone? Your son is the one with the AH behavior and needs a punishment. Looking at some of your replies, it seems your husband let an old supressed insecurity get the best of him. I'm not saying to forgive him, that is up to you if you can, but that should be something you should address in couples therapy. Really hope you can work things out and wish you all the best.", "Nta - your entire family freaked out over you having DINNER with someone??? They are ALL ridiculous.", "NTA\n\nNot very good at giving advice, so bear with me. \n\nI would explain to your son that what he did was wrong, that jumping to conclusions like that can and will destroy relationships, and often, those relationships can not be salvaged afterward. That a lot of the time people split because of situations like these. This doesn't just apply to you and your husband's relationship, but also any relationship your son has. That what someone says or does can ruin people's relationships, jobs, or reputation, and he should always hear both sides of the story before making that conclusion. I wouldn't fault your son for getting upset in the moment, he had no context for the situation, but how he handled it was wrong.\n\nYour husband, on the other hand, should've tried to de-escalate the situation, had your son go to his room, and asked about it when you got home. Your husband obviously still feels he can't trust you, and that is an issue he needs to fix, but he shouldn't have allowed your son to say the stuff he said. I'd be more hurt at not being trusted than being accused, as obviously he wasn't on your side from the start.", "I don't understand why your son didn't approach you in the restaurant. Mine would have, and I would have introduced him to my boss. If you were sneaking around, he would have caught you right then, but since you're innocent that would have cleared everything up immediately. This would have prevented all that trauma. As far as your dh, I would make him work his ass off to win me back. And I would insist he start keeping a calendar of events since his memory is crap. Had he been more in tune, that would have avoided the trauma too. Absolutely none of this is your fault.", "Your husband is the biggest AH and spineless. Even if it was true, he should NOT have handed it that way.

Your son has troubling language regarding women so I would also have him go to individual therapy.", "NTA\n\nJesus, that's horrible.", "NTA - and going by your comments, your son needs to be put in his place and learn how to respect his parents. Jumping to conclusions and telling your whole family before even confronting you, not cool.", "Holy hell, NTA.

On reddit, if roles were reversed, every woman on here would be screaming trauma...she has PTSD...I think it's definitely understandable to be upset angry and hurt but you seem empathetic enough to hopefully understand that how your son announced it may not have given him enough time to process it before he was totally shaken. \nI'm sorry if I'm not making sense lol.

If you know you\u2019re innocent it can be infuriating to be accused but it\u2019s important to understand the spouse\u2019s perspective. He wasn\u2019t thinking straight and was obviously distraught. But if he can do easily believe this of you perhaps you need to look deeper, do you really have the right to be quite so indignant? \n\nI\u2019ll probably be downvoted for this because men aren\u2019t allowed to have feelings on Reddit but\u2026\n\nI\u2019ve posted before about my infidelity in my marriage and neither of you really gets over it, even if you\u2019re \u2018on a break\u2019.

I was lucky that I have an incredibly understanding husband but I know that still, 11 years later, he can find things triggering. He is largely trusting and never makes me feel like the \u2018baddie\u2019 or like I\u2019m somehow less deserving of his love or anything, but I do my best to be an open book. He doesn\u2019t ask to look but I\u2019d have no problem with him checking my phone and socials, etc.\n\nIn other words, I understand I hurt him and do not have any moral high ground, even though he never makes me feel it, no one is beyond reproach. If he was suspicious I would try to be patient, understanding and reassuring. Yes he\u2019s insecure, and for good reason. He sounds like a feeling and emotional man, reassurance may be the price you have to pay for the past if you want to make the marriage work.

Or perhaps it's the fact she wanted to be with anyone else other than him. Some men are just insecure, especially if they learn that the woman they love has been with other men.

It almost sounds like your husband sent him there, to \u201ccatch\u201d you. I hope you\u2019re making them both sweat it, until you calm down. Then, I\u2019d absolutely DEMAND your husband goes to counseling. I\u2019d think your son may benefit as well. He jumped right on the \u201cyou\u2019re a slut\u201d train. That\u2019s not ok to call anyone that. It\u2019s misogynistic. Although it\u2019s a teachable moment for your son. Your husband\u2026\u2026 yeah I\u2019d reconsider the entire marriage after that. He can\u2019t get over the fact you dated someone else when you were broken up? That\u2019s ridiculous. I can understand feeling a sting, but he\u2019s obviously got much bigger issues.", "NTA\n\nAlso actions, and lack of actions, have consequences.

But your son and husband are.", "Regardless of your husbands insecurity, your son shouldn\u2019t have reacted that way and your husband shouldn\u2019t have put those insecurities on your son! He should have handled such a situation much better than letting your son overreact that way! So yeah you are definitely NTA but I would worry about how your son treats other women/girls if he is that fast to jump to conclusions!", "NTA- Your son is old enough to have handled this with more sensitivity. I\u2019m most disappointed in your husband for going along with this ambush. \n\nI would recommend that you sit down with your son and explain how irresponsible it was for him to jump to this conclusion and how inappropriate calling you names is. I wouldn\u2019t sugar coat the fact that your marriage could have broken irrevocably because of his hair trigger actions. He seems to want to be a big bad adult, don\u2019t hide the very real potential consequences from him.", "NTA. 19 Needs to move out, consequences you know. Hubby needs a date book that you fill in.", "NTA and I'm so sorry this happened to you", "NTA but I do need info! \n\nwhere did your son learn to be so disrespectful toward women? Calling his own mother a slut? This really worries me not only because he called you a slut but because he found you, hid and took photos then went home and told everyone including his siblings. He is clearly looking for drama or attention.. if you don\u2019t usually have any issue with him then I think you might need to spend more time with him because something else could be going on. \n\nIs there a reason he would jump to infidelity so quick? I would be wondering if something was going on with one of his friends parents or he himself was cheated on recently.", "Sheesh, that remark is a slapping offense\u2026", "NTA and you do not have a son problem, you have a husband problem.  What is he saying to your kids?", "NTA. But your son and husband certainly are. Your son was clearly out of bounds. jumping to that conclusion and calling you a slut was seriously disrespectful and he should have been raised better. Your husband believing that, forgetful or not, and involving the kids was totally off the wall after your time together. I really doubt I could resolve that lack of trust and disrespect from my family.  Therapy would be mandatory, and time apart optional.", "Does any of this really seem real? I may be rather sinical but you were alone with your boss for long enough that he walked in saw you took a picture and left.\n\nOnce he left he managed to beat you home with enough time to go through this with your partner and he is so forgetful he goes straight to cheating instead of remembering you are going out for work.", "NTA\n\nMake your husband move out. Send your son to a relative's house for a month.\n\nthis is seriously a marriage ending issue (at least for me), as I would no longer trust my partner. The husband automatically jumped to \"my wife is cheating\" instead of defending his partner of 20 years. When trust is gone, I can't stay married to the person.\n\nHow can you ever trust the husband again knowing that he never trusted you and still considers you to have cheated by having had a relationship when you were broken up in your teens?  \n\nHow can you trust a partner who clearly has told your son that you cheated on him? (or else why would your child think cheater, someone, probably spouse said you were a previous cheater to son)\n\nThis is also a relationship suspended issue with the son.  He saw op sitting at a table with another man and jumped to \"my mother is a slut.\"  The son needs therapy, and a hard look at himself.", "NTA but....

Do you know what kind of content they watch? This is giving me manosphere vibes", "I love my kid more than anything else in the world and generally don\u2019t yell at him but oof, I\u2019d have lost my shit.  I hate to say it but I think this would fundamentally alter my relationship with both the kid and husband in this scenario\u2026 I don\u2019t think any amount of therapy would help me forget how quick and easy it was for both of them to turn on me\u2026", "NTA \n\nThis is very worrying behavior from both your son and husband. Why did he immediately jump to infidelity and why was your husband so willingly to be believe him that fast without even getting your part????? Definitely need to talk to both of them and possibly see what your son is getting into online.\n\nAdd on: Read a few comments and I\u2019m inclined to believe that your husband has a hand in what your son thought. What made me believe this is that they had no problem in involving the youngest kids in this mess right away. Those kids must have been heartbroken and scared that the family was going to rip apart. Your husband and son should apologize to them too.", "NTA! its quite strange how fast he jumped toward you cheating on your husband. Perhaps he is doing the same to his girlfriend?", "Holy. That's a strong NTA and I'd be seriously considering separation right now. \n\nI'd also be explaining to your jerk son that his attitude toward women is incredibly wrong, and that if he doesn't fix it immediately, he will eventually end up alone and bitter because no woman would tolerate that crap from her partner.", "NTA? wtf?", "I read your comments, quite apparently the son knows about your break up and sleeping with another man. You were broken up with your husband at the time so it\u2019s not wrong. The number of men you slept with has no bearing on anything because you\u2019ve never cheated on your husband. If you choose to go back to your husband, I would insist on couples counseling because there\u2019s quite obviously still issues from your break up. There wasn\u2019t on your side it seems until now. Your husband did a good job creating the problem. If you indeed screamed at your son (I often on this sub wonder if people are truly screaming because it\u2019s used so often or if they just raised their voice which is different) I don\u2019t actually approve because screaming should only be used in times of danger. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily make you TA either. Your son just accused you of something horrible and called you a horrible name besides so I understand the actual anger you probably felt. NTA. If you go back to your husband, do it with the condition of counseling for the both of you and maybe family counseling for you and your oldest although after the horrible accusations you might find it helpful for the younger ones because they might not know how to handle the feelings they might feel at this whole debacle! Good luck!", "NTA at all. Your son was out of line and your husband is a TA for not being more in tune with your plans. \n\nWhy did your son have a photo of you and your boss though?", "NTA shame on your son for jumping to conclusions and telling the whole family, and shame on your husband for immediately believing him.  I don't blame you one bit for being furious, and I'd be very concerned that your son is exhibiting some incel characteristics.", "NTA. Your son is. Wow. First of all? Your marriage is none of his business until it needs to be. \nAnd he called you out if your name for no reason? Oh I wouldn't slapped him right across the face.", "NTA. What your son did was wrong and your husband's poor memory is no excuse. I would have a talk with your son about how what he did was wrong and the language that he used was extremely inappropriate. Make it clear that you never want to hear him use that kind of language again. Ground him for two or so weeks. I would also look into what he is getting up to online and what kind of crowd he is hanging around. If he is into the incel community, if he listens to Andrew Tate, I would shut that down hard and fast. Make it clear to him that those people are misogynists and not to be trusted or believed.\n\nAs for your husband, you need to have a serious discussion with him about his reaction. How it was entirely inappropriate and uncalled for to bring your younger two children into, how he should have shut your older son down and talked to you when you got home like adults. I would tell him that he needs to start going to therapy again and that you need to go to couples therapy together to work through his issues. He also needs to work on his memory issues. You told him where you were going and because he couldn't be bothered to remember what you told him, it added fuel to the fire.", "NTA\n\nAlso obviously it was a work dinner your husband was aware of\u2026. But if it wasn\u2019t, can\u2019t one get dinner with a friend of the opposite sex\u2026.\n\nTo jump to cheating is absolutely fucking insane!\n\nEdit: spelling error", "NTA but I blame your husband more. He has no excuse for not remembering, and shouldn't have taken your son at face value.", "I mean NTA for yelling at the son, but let's be real, you're angry right now, rightfully so, but YTA if you don't forgive your son for being a dumb teenager eventually.  As dumb as this situation is, you're a mother, and obviously there are some quirks with your son, try to resolve that so he can grow up to be a better person.\n\nDon't hold too much against your husband either, he wasn't aggressively accusing you, he had been provided a narrative and some \"evidence\" from your son, and of course that can be a lot to hear if you feel like it's coming out of left field.  You yourself said your husband might lose his head if it weren't attached, so he probably wasn't super analytical when his own son, which he probably didn't think to be skeptical of, was ambushing him with this stuff.\n\nI'm not saying it makes it right, just that it's not as evil as you might feel it is.", "NTA, I\u2019d take the younger two and go somewhere to cool off for a couple of weeks. Also to stress to your husband and oldest son that this is a serious issue and it can\u2019t just be solved by an apology. What they did was terrible. Poor memory issues isn\u2019t an excuse, it\u2019s just incompetence and frankly inexcusable. There are so many ways including a smartphone to help a person remember tasks. Why your son just jumped to that conclusion is an issue in itself that you need to look into. Could be your husband, social media, friends\u2026 He needs to do more than just an apology and letting this drop.", "NTA! I suggest you take some time away from your family. It\u2019s clear they don\u2019t appreciate you if they were so quick to shame/turn against you. Go to a hotel or stay with family/friends until you have calmed down. You need to have a discussion with your husband as to why he was so quick to believe your son especially when he should know your routine. As for you son, he needs to be punished. For him to slut shame you and disrespect you so easily, he needs to be put in his place. I wish you all the best. Also, maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m young, unmarried and not a mother. But, I would have broken up with my husband then and there.", "Your son called you a slut to your face. Your. SON. Called. You. A. Slut. To. Your. Face. And...your husband did nothing. NOTHING! The level of disrespect shown for you is galling! NTA that's for sure!\n\nYou said that you might not be able to forgive them. I don't blame you. Right now, extending forgiveness is a goal for the bottom of your list. Right now, you have bigger issues with them. \n\nFirst of all, what caused your son to jump to the conclusion that he did? What were his influences? Did one of his friends walk in on a cheating parent? Is he listening to incel or misogynistic podcasts? Did your husband actually not \"forget\" about the dinner and send your son over there to spy on you?\n\nSecondly, why didn't your husband defend you? Why did he just accept what your son said at face value? You saw someone else WHEN YOU TWO HAD BROKEN UP. You were free to enter another relationship, you had that right. It looks to me as if your husband looks at this situation like an act of infidelity...STILL...and that's a serious problem! He was so quick to accept the word of a teenage boy who called his mother a slut, that one wonders what is going on with him. I mean, he didn't even speak out at such disrespect. \n\nMay I suggest that you establish some firm boundaries before you even consider going \"home\"? Consider going home ONLY ON THE CONDITION THAT all parties attend family therapy. Them-and only then-will you come home. And don't worry about forgiving ANYONE until you've worked through the issues.

I have ADHD and forget a lot of things. Which is why a) I know not to trust my memory and b) have gotten help for it. How can this dude react like that?! Even if he hadn't forgotten it that's still a very weird reaction, but even more so, I can't imagine assuming things without going \"hey, honey, did you mention something about going out today?\"  \n\nAnd yeah, as you said, even if that wasn't a factor, why would he instantly believe something like that without questioning it and without asking her about it? Not to mention the son's reaction, who just SAW them on a business dinner and was sure they cheated AND decided to say it in front of everyone.", "For real! I'm a woman and my current boss is a man. We're usually the only people who go into the office so we end up having lunch together a lot.

He took it further, he told everyone and then called you a slut - a filthy, derogatory term in front of your entire family. Your son called you slut because he saw you eating dinner with someone of the opposite sex. He has such little respect for you that he filled in all the blanks and called you a slut - the woman who gave birth to him. I would be so disappointed in him. I would drive home the point over and over again how he was being sexist to his own mother. How you cannot let this go easily because he is getting older and needs to learn a lesson. How disappointed you are that he has such little respect for you. And how cowardly it was to take a photo and cause a stir in the household you made with your husband.\n\nAs for your husband, he's a fool. Seeing a photo of you eating with your boss should not equal you having an affair. I eat with coworkers all the time, and my husband thinks nothing of it. He has no faith in you as a wife, and to allow your son to rant and rave about a freaking dinner - he should be ashamed of himself. He should have stopped this right when it started and not allow it to get to this point. He should have told the son that he would talk to you when you got home and that he needed to shut his mouth and not accuse you of something dirty because of a mere photo of a dinner.\n\nYou mentioned that before you got married you briefly broke up and you dated and had sex with another man. Who gives a crap. That happens. You were not in a relationship at the time, and you do not deserve the disrespect you were shown by the 2 men in your life. They need to both grovel and rethink their treatment of women.", "I guess it was too hard to go over and TALK TO  YOU IN PERSON...when he could just take a photo and slink out the door.

Just hanging out with someone of the opposite sex equals slut.  Guess her son thinks women should have a male escort from the family to avoid such confusion.  Maybe make it so that women can\u2019t work, that would solve it.  The fact that the Dad was in the living room hugging the kids tells me he already made up his mind on a picture of two coworkers out to dinner.

She's in a PUBLIC restauraunt, presumably with other patrons and waitstaff. She has no obligation to count how many of her coworkers are still in the building and make sure she leaves before the last one.

If OP is in a coffee shop and her boss comes in line behind her, should she just leave? What if they cross paths at the grocery store, drop her cart and run? If OP has to stay late at work, do they have to leave the extra work for later, even if it's time sensitive? I get where you're coming from but it's a bit victim blame-y and is putting the responsibility for the relationship solely on one partner, in this instance specifically the wife and that's not cool.

My. God.  How is it your husband even allowed this to happen? There are so many issues here that it\u2019s going to take extensive counseling to work through them, if it\u2019s even possible.\n\n1.  Your son walks into the restaurant and sees you alone with your boss. It\u2019s a dinner.  He didn\u2019t catch you in bed.  Why does he immediately jump to cheating?

Does your husband remove the younger children from the situation to have a private conversation with your son?  No, he sits on the couch and allows them to \u201ccomfort\u201d him as he plays the role of professional victim.  He allows this to build in drama and intensity.\n\n3.  Your son uses unforgivable language to your face.  Does your husband stop him?  No, he lets this play out.  He clearly gets a charge of some kind from letting you be attacked by your son.\n\nI urge you to take the younger two children and go stay in an extended stay hotel, Air BnB, or with a relative (at least) until after the first couples counseling session with your husband.  You absolutely have to send a strong message here.  You are role modeling for your children what can happen when one makes an unfounded accusation against another person.  They must learn that jumping to conclusions with no evidence in hand can lead to life changing consequences for both the accuser and the accused.  \n\nBTW, I\u2019m not buying the bad memory argument.  The minute your kid came home with a picture of you in a restaurant with your boss, that should have triggered the memory of your telling your husband about the dinner.  He willfully allowed this situation to blow up because he still has unresolved issues about something that happened when you had broken up years before.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry, but your relationship with your husband may be irretrievable now.  The couples counseling would be a last-ditch effort to save it, and it\u2019s essential that your husband understand that his lack of trust in you has made your son a casualty in a war you didn\u2019t even know you were still fighting.\n\nNTA.  Get the younger kids out of the house and take a time out.  When you feel calm and after you\u2019ve been gone a few days or even a week, talk to your son and debrief all the ways jumping to conclusions could affect his relationships going forward.  He should hope to God that if someone ever made an unfounded accusation against him that his family would stand by him until they saw irrefutable proof that demonstrated he was guilty (I\u2019m channeling a couple of male teaching colleagues who were unjustly accused of sexual abuse and had their careers destroyed despite being cleared later).\n\nNTA.  What a mess.", "This sounds like a mutual apology is necessary. The son took a scene out of context and you were right to be angry since you were confronted and on the spot having already been judged. Yeah, you shouldn't have screamed, and he shouldn't have been so eager to convict.  Take the high ground and sit down with them, apologizing for the confusion.  Reiterate that they have no reason to fear, and that if they have any questions, to ask them calmly before jumping to conclusions.  Then apologize for shouting, as shouting doesn't fix things.  Shouting creates distance not connections. Then explain you reacted without thinking.  That should be enough to set the balance right again and leaves the ball in their court to apologize for their end of it.  Good luck!", "This is becoming common. Kids finding texts and assuming their parent is cheating. Now they hide in the bushes. Yikes.", "NTA WOW, your family is insane", "NTA & i dunno how i would be able to come back from this. Wow.", "NTA. He had no right to treat you that way nor did he have the right to call you that ever. You had every right however to yell at him for it. You are owed HUGE apologies from them for sure.", "NTA. Do you know why divorces are so expensive?\n\nBecause they\u2019re worth it.", "NTA, but I'd be more pissed at your husband than your son. Your son shouldn't have jumped to conclusions and definitely shouldn't have insulted you, but at least he's a dumb 17 year old. Your husband has known you for 24 years and couldn't even have backed you??? That's way worse in my eyes.", "NTA", "NTA. It would have been one thing for them to ask you about the situation but for your son to go on the attack and to call you what he did. He owes you serious apologies.", "NTA and these are some really concerning behaviors from your son and husband.", "You are absolutely NTA.  \n\n\nYour husband and oldest are overmassive black hole level AHs.  \n\n\nFirst your son for automatically jumping to the conclusion that two adults can't hang out together at a restaurant without being some kind of f\\*ckbuddies. I feel so bad for any woman he ever dates/marries, because she is gonna be controlled within an inch of her sanity.\n\nSecond, your husband for not even questioning your son's accusation and just assuming it's true. If my son ever came to me and showed me a pic of my wife sitting with someone else at a restaurant, my only response would be, \"Looks fun, I should ask her how the food is there.\" I have a bad memory, too, but I can usually shake the memory loose; the fact he completely dumped it and couldn't recall it even during a high-stress environment like this tells me he doesn't have a bad memory; he just straight up doesn't listen to you.", "NTA\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be able to forgive them.  Especially the husband.  Kids, even older ones, don\u2019t understand their actions.  Your husband should\u2019ve known better.  Marriage and family counseling is probably necessary.  I\u2019m sorry you have to deal with this.", "NTA but also I feel like op could have reminded her husband of the dinner like the day before maybe if she knew his memory was bad or maybe mention it to the kids so if saw anything they wouldn't go jumping to conclusions", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry. Your son and your husband both owe you a Hell of an apology!", "NTA at all. I hope you have someone supporting you during this. Your husband is an asshole for not remembering something important, like a team dinner you discussed with him prior. That's not forgetting, that is not respecting you enough to listen when you talk. Your son is a HUGE asshole for assuming cheating without anything else, shut shaming, name calling, and probably more I'm not thinking of. Honestly, my support of him would end immediately. He'd need to move out and find a way to make amends if he wanted to ever get back into being someone i trusted or wanted to soend time with. \n\nI love my children, but if one of them did that to me the relationship would suffer immensely.", "Nta", "Nta but what is going on in your family dynamics that they automatically think that you are doing something underhanded?", "Damn.

The right way to handle this was in private between the two of you. Your son should never have been in the room to react this way. As far as dealing with your son, he is old enough to understand that he has now damaged your relationship and it will take time for any repairs.", "NTA. So sorry you experienced this", "Definitely NTA.  Sounds to me like both your husband and your eldest should have been 'taken behind the wood shed', as my dad would've said.  My parents divorced when I was young and for years they went back and forth at each other.  That being said, as much as they argued and fought (Usually over us kids) if I'd have EVER said something like that to my mother my dad would have broken my jaw.  \n\nYour son still has a lot of growing up to do; I'm in my late forties and I'll admit, I didn't consider myself grown until I hit my late twenties.  That being said, he was still out of line.  And your husband shouldn't have jumped to conclusions that quickly.  My wife and I have had our issues, but not once has she ever given me a reason not to trust her, and if something like this were to happen I can honestly say I'd be more rational about it before I cried \"Cheater!\".  I'd say let them stew for a little while longer and then try to get past it.", "NTA, but your husband is something else. He should believe you're cheating on him because of one innocent picture. I would definitely consider couples therapy or reconsider the whole relationship.", " This is a mess because if he was to call you a slut in-front of his younger siblings he definitely called you way worse in front of his friends that night. \n\nYour son needs to go on a apology tour.", "I was ready to say that you were definitely the AH without even reading your post. I was picturing you screaming at a 6 yr old for spilling his juice. NTA", "Yeesh, you not only have a son problem but you also have a giant husband problem.\n\nI wouldn't go back.

I would have losty absolute biscuits.", "NTA. They need to earn your forgiveness and earn back your trust. And you\u2019re not obligated to do either.", "Your son accused you of cheating. Your husband did nothing to stop this mess. All they are offering are lame ass apologies which mean nothing. This is not an \"oops, my bad\" situation. I'm so sorry you are going through this.", ".", "NTA\n\nI can\u2019t believe he jumped to that all on his own, it seems extreme; do you think you husband thought you were lying about it being a work event and sent your son to spy on you?", "Good gravy, of course you\u2019re NTA.", "NTA. Do I condone slapping a kid? No, not at all. But your kid really has a lot of learning to do the next year before he\u2019s an adult - so I would evaluate that as well (has he been given too much free time with teenagers and not enough time with adults that are good role modes?) and your husband isn\u2019t a great role model. \n\nI would take your son out for a walk to a park or lunch and let this be a teaching lesson. Inform him that you forgive him but that he can learn a lot from this situation, such as, he should have spoken to you directly - he could have either come up to you at the restaurant (which would have taught him how to read body language - ie you would have been super welcoming to introduce your kid to your boss which would have indicated you weren\u2019t embarrassed at all and not cheating) or he could have called you and asked or spoken to you when you got home. And if he didn\u2019t like your answer he could bring it up to his dad. He shouldn\u2019t have said anything in front of other people - the two youngest - since he still really didn\u2019t know the whole picture. He needs to learn to communicate problems or concerns without being an asshole himself and degrading another person. It was unacceptable to bring it up in the manner he did, the words he used etc. \n\nAs for your husband, the husband totally messed up. He didn\u2019t have his son calm down - say let\u2019s speak in private. He instead let this whole thing take place in front of everyone without getting information from you first. He is also lousy for not defending you at the outset. Parental relationships stay with the parents.They should not involve the kids. You guys need therapy again - he has problems (possibly from whatever caused you guys to split the prior times) and it\u2019s now involved the entire house. On a night that was supposed to be celebratory for you and your team - turned horrible because of his inability to parent and defend his wife before jumping to conclusions. \n\nAnd even if you did look like you were on a date (which you weren\u2019t) your husband should have immediately told your son to leave when he called you a slut, especially with little ones around. It is incredibly disrespectful and inappropriate for a 17 yo to use that word.", "WHOA. It was not Son's place to inject himself into your marriage and to make such accusations without context or even other proof. It's rather alarming that he has no trust or respect for you. I saw in another comment that you and Husband separated for a little while, and you saw another person during that time. Husband is clearly not over it because instead of shutting down your son's accusations, he immediately believed it. Son clearly had and still has a big problem with it as well. Dear, oh dear. What a horrible mess. I'm really sorry this happened OP. NTA.", "NTA\n\nYour son was WAY out of line with the way he handled the whole situation.  Jumping to extreme conclusions, involving the whole family, yelling at you and calling you names, etc.    \n\nIf he was so concerned he could have just walked straight up to you at the restaurant and confronted you.    \n\nWhich if you had been cheating he would have gotten a panicked deer in the headlights type of response to confirm his suspicions.    \n\nHowever since you weren't cheating or doing anything inappropriate he would have:    \nA - Seen that the two of you were sitting at a large table that had obviously had more people sitting and eating at it,    \nB - You likely would have responded by casually introducing/re-introducing your boss and your son \"Boss have you met my son ______ before?  Son you remember _______ my Boss.  We were just finishing up our team/department sales reward dinner, would you like to join us while we finish our coffee?\"\n\nHe also could have texted you asking where you were and your answer would have made things clear as well.  If you were cheating you would most likely have lied about your whereabouts.

You understand he was hurting and wanted to hurt you back, but that isn't the way people who love one and other, do things. We talk it out and explain why we're hurt or angry without using words that harm. \nYou may want to take your husband to the doctor because your son telling him you were at a restaurant with your boss should have jogged his memory. There might be something medical going on there. It's worth looking into.\n\nThe reason I laughed is that I also had a similar situation with my son. Let me tell you. It might help figure this out for you.\n\nSo my husband had a vasectomy, so no birth control needed. I'm pre menopausal and my doctor is treating the symptoms with an I.U.D. which I bought and left in the bag to take to my appointment. Well, my son was acting weird, but teenage boys, need I say more. He came to me and said,\" Mom, we need to talk.\" I said, \" Sure, what do you need?\" He says, ' I am so disgustingly disappointed in you I can hardly think straight!\" Umm, what?!?\" He throws the bag onto my lap with the I.U.D in it (nosey little brat) and said,\" there's only one reason I can think of that you would need an I.U.D. and Dad has had a vasectomy!\" I started laughing. He wasn't amused. \"There's nothing funny about this situation! Dad loves you, and you're betraying him!\" I said, \" Son, thank you for coming to me. That must have been hard for you. I'm not having an affair on your Dad. I would never hurt him that way. Ever! Do you understand?\" He said then why the I.U.D. it suggests otherwise?\" I said, \" Son, let us talk about a woman and what happens to her body as she gets older.\" We proceed to have a conversation that amuses me greatly and embarrasses him. Win win in my books.\n\nSo my point is that communication is everything.  After I laughed, I thanked him for trusting me enough to come to me and talk about it. Later, we regaled his father with the details and laughed some more. It was an easy assumption to make. I could have got angry and embarrassed, but I chose to make it a learning moment.

What you said to your son was not out of line, his choice of words made that happen and he needs to be held accountable for what he did and said. \nabout the whole situation there you cannot blame everything on them as said about your husband, telling him is like telling nobody and they did not know the whole thing.\nas you describe your husband's reaction, he was more scared than angry or heart, he was scared that his marriage and his family is destroyed, (according to your description of him) he was as information as they were and in a situation like this (especially with the history you provide) infidelity is one of the first thing that comes to your head. you cannot hold them accountable for everything happen there as you also played a part in it. my advice, talk to them.", "NTA. You were accused of something you didn\u2019t do with no chance of explaining. Your husband is the asshole because he knew.", "NTA the son definitely hates women, especially his mother. He just couldn\u2019t wait to rip his family apart. A reasonable response would have been to ask you directly. And the husband clearly has issues if the first thing he said wasn\u2019t \u201ckid, it\u2019s the usual night she has dinner with work people\u201d.", "NTA. No one\u2019s an asshole in this situation. They were completely justified making that assumption, had you just explained the situation after being confronted everything would\u2019ve been immediately diffused. You got way too offended.", "nta", "NTA. It was wrong of your son to play spy and wrong for him to say what he did when he didn't know the facts.", "Why did you not cut the convo off and make this a personal convo. This was not for children.", "I guess I can understand shouting in the moment, given the shock and hurt, but please remember that you and your husband are the ones who made your son who he is.  You need to evaluate where you went wrong that he behaved this way, whether that's misogyny and vitriol he's finding online or maybe coming from inside the house.", "NTA.  Honestly - it's not the son for me, it's that your husband didn't come to your defense.  You need to have a family meeting to sort this out.  If you don't discuss this with them in a cool manner, it's going to get worse.", "NTA.  In addition to a calm discussion with your son and husband and appropriate consequences, I would also follow up with a family calendar.  It appears that none of your family members knew where you were, which can cause insecurity and significant worry, and can sometimes be an issue in an emergency.\n\nOur family has a shared Google calendar so everyone can access it from their phones.\n\nSome families have a written calendar on the wall.\n\nFind what works for your crew and implement it.", "Yes! If it were me, son would have to go and stay gone. He meets a woman himself? Mom gets a pic of him with any other woman of any age and tells girlfriend that he\u2019s cheating, here\u2019s the photo. He can see a tiny, tiny fraction of how she must feel.", "I mistakenly thought your son was 19 and not 17. Which makes your husband believing a minor child rather than an adult child (I get 2 years doesn\u2019t make a lot difference, but still a 19 year old would have more exposure to the world than a 17 year old). I change my advice and recommend divorce.", "Right!? Right!? If my brother did that, god he\u2019d \u201cstill be rolling\u201d as my dad used to say. No one disrespected mom. No one.", "It sounds like the husband is insecure, but also bitter about her being able to find someone while probably was incapable.  OP who did the breaking up when you saw someone else on break?", "It's illegal to kick out a minor.", "Yep me as well. I read this & immediately went to OH HELL NO.", "I'd be WAY too embarrassed to call my co-workers. Hey Becky.... just calling so you can verify the whole team was at dinner tonight ,because my hubs and son don't trust me and think I'm banging our boss because of it.....", "Bold of you to assume that an asshole like this kid would have a functioning relationship with a girl", "She shouldn\u2019t need to babysit her husband and help him remember over and over after telling him.  That\u2019s how toddlers are managed, not grown adults with children of their own.  That kind of forgetfulness when you have parental responsibilities can lead to serious fuckups, as demonstrated, and it\u2019s his job to prove to her that he can remember simple shit on his own.  If he\u2019s really so lazy/incapable he needs someone to write every event down for him, he should go live with his mommy and leave the parenting to her.", "Everyone knows when you are having an illicit affair, you go to a popular local buffet where everyone is constantly getting up and walking around. Make sure you pick a table so if anyone you know walks in, they see you right away without you seeing them.  /s", "You were on a break!", "Tell that to all the people who throw their LGBTQ kids out of the house, lmao.", "It baffles me that your son jumped to that conclusion so easily. Is HE cheating on his girlfriend? Do his friends cheat? Like, why would he have it so normalized that the only thing he could assume you were doing was cheating??", "My wife would do the same thing to me and constantly accuses me of possibly cheating on her. I work 11 hour days all week to make ends meet while she\u2019s a SAHM. \n\nI tell her look at my dash cam if she doesn\u2019t trust me cause I\u2019m just going to and from work and she acts like I\u2019m being a smart ass. And says I could be cheating with someone while at work.\n\nShe let her previous divorce ruin our marriage because she refused to seek help for her insecurities and trust issues. I thought she\u2019d eventually trust me but nope it\u2019s been 8 years and still no trust.", "You are right. Her husband sucks as well.", "You're half right. It's illegal to make a minor homeless. She can kick him out to live with a relative. She can also tell him that the day he turns 18, he's no longer welcome in that house. \n\nIf it were me, though, and literally no one gave me the benefit of the doubt **based off a no-context photo**, I'd kick the husband **and** the son out.\n\nSeriously though, that household is clearly already broken.\n\nEdit: fixed typo", "The son is gives me Andrew Tate-fan vibes.", "According to my wife it would.", "OP shouldn\u2019t be following the parenting example of homophobic assholes who are breaking the law.", "It must have been too hard for the dad to text her and ask where she was too. MUCH easier to allow a 17year olds rage and fantasy to fly off the hook", "Her husband probably told their son about the time they broke up before they were married when OP dated and slept with another man. Her husband apparently went to therapy because he struggled with it and apparently still is 20 years later.", "Insecurities lead to this shit. \n\nsource: my (soon to be ex)wife is like this\n\nI\u2019ve dealt with it for 8 years and it\u2019s been fucking exhausting having to defend myself from accusations on an almost constant basis.\n\nShe went through a rough divorce before me but I\u2019ve never given her reason to not trust me, yet she doesn\u2019t trust me after 8 years and still uses her previous divorce as an excuse.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine just having that thought process, how would you ever be able to be really happy in a relationship if you can\u2019t trust who you\u2019re with?", "He didn\u2019t ask. He assumed, accused, and called her a name.", "where did he ask that?", "If he just sat there and believed it, without trying to get to the bottom of it an automatically believed his wife was a cheater without question or proof then he has issues as well as their son.", "Whether son is an incel \ud83e\udd2eor a follower of Tate\ud83e\udd22 I think it\u00b4s time the son is kicked out of his comfortable nest. He is damaging the family home and relationships.   \nOP, I encourage you to start an escape fund in a different bank than you have been using. Your husband leapt to the son\u00b4s conclusion. Stop buying anything extra and put aside your escape money FIRST. Tell no one.   \nIf husband is this irrational, you need a life raft.  He has shown he does not trust you. Which usually mean HE knows that he is not trustworthy. Maybe he is ready to assume you are cheating because he has strayed in the past.", "You know, I wanted to say I wouldn't be quick to divorce my husband but I'm not completely sure. I've been married almost a decade and I would be so hurt and disappointed in both of them. The fact my husband would even entertain that I was cheating because I was with my boss at a Chinese buffet would rock the foundation of my relationship. The fact that my son called me a slut and my husband did nothing would rock me to my core. This would be a lot for me to stomach, and I'd probably leave for a bit while I collected myself. I'd get my younger 2 though and leave my husband and oldest to think about their treatment of me.", "Who knows though? You know men can be big hypocrites about that.", "The problem here is the son. I don\u2019t know why everyone keeps looking past this. He is already an active problem within his own home and without intervention he is going to be, and do, far worse than this. \n\nI see a dependent spouse who can\u2019t get his shit together and a malevolent, manipulative kid who\u2019s going to be legally able to purchase guns inside of a year. Therapy five years ago might have fixed that. Now? Ha. Good luck.", "Or he's the one having an affair.", "Yeah I just read that. They were broken up at the time, so he had nothing to be upset about, but emotions are so rarely logical. Even do, her son clearly picked up the slut shaming behavior from his father. Just makes me feel even stronger that they're needs to be consequences for the son. For the way he spoke to her, for the disrespect and cruelty and misogyny in it. Ideally, her husband needs to explain his role in this to the son and explain how wrong it was.", "Insecurities damage a lot of relationships, but if, as op says, this came out of the blue, there's more than insecurities at play. Her son was the first to jump on the infidelity train. That tells me there's more to this. It would take a little of distance between them for him to jump straight to cheating, and to speak to her the way he did. I suspect she doesn't spend a lot of time at home with her family. The casual way she speaks about her son not being around is indicative of the gap.", "Yeah, my first husband accused me of cheating all the time, with men I thought disgusting. I finally decided I might as well cheat.", "We don't know the words he used when he \"confronted\" her with her \"infidelity\", we don't know if he is a \" giver who asks questions\" or a \"taker who makes statements\" in communication, but we do know that when son confronted mom with the picture he took, mom's response was to ask dad \" do you believe this?\" to which son replied \" you aren't even going to deny it?\" & that she didn't deny/response whatever he said \n\nInsults are not ever appropriate. Insults are not ever ok. Even if mom was cheating, it is not OK for son to say that to his mom. But I understand why he did.  \n\nAgain, the romantic partner is not the only person who feels unloved, betrayed, & cheated if there is infidelity \n\nNot answering questions is a huge, manipulation red flag \n\nIf OP had a photo of husband eating with a strange woman & she posted on reddit that she confronted him & showed him the picture but he asked if she believed that he cheated instead of clearly saying \"no\", most people would say that him avoiding answering the question was a huge red flag \n\nI don't usually name call people but I would believe that my fear was confirmed like son did.", "No it\u2019s just Reddit", "[removed]", "You \u201ccut off\u201d someone financially. She cannot cut him off.", "The framing of the question this asshole posed to his mother (who loves him and materially supports him, btw) forces her to accept his reality. \u201cYou don\u2019t deny it?\u201d Deny what, that she crushed it at work and had dinner to celebrate her ability to continue to be able to support his worthless ass? \n\nShe owns that home. She owns the reality of her situation. She has no need to validate the delusions of the redpilled asshole kid whose misogynistic lifestyle her income supports. \n\nSemantics have no place in this conversation. Discipline does.", "Okay.
