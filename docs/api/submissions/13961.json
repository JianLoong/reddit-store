He's a very active child and spends most of his time at school or out with friends, this never bothers me since he tells me who he's out with and when he'll be getting home. A few weeks ago my boss announced we broke our latest sales record so he would be taking us all out to dinner on Friday the 31st. We were all pretty excited since we don't do the typical \"team building\" excursions that other jobs hold. I had informed my husband of this but he has a very bad memory, I'm convinced he'd lose his head if it weren't attached to his body. Well, Friday came and we all went to dinner straight from work at a local Chinese buffet, as time passed everyone had their fill and left. By the time I left, it was only my boss and me. He thanked me for my hard work as he had done with my other coworkers and we went our separate ways for the night. When I got home I knew something was wrong.

It doesn\u2019t matter if he forgot you had a dinner with workmates, doesn\u2019t he trust you?  And even if he did think something was off, it was not okay to have your kids involved. I understand why it might be hard for you to get past that. I know it would be hard for me to forgive the complete lack of trust. \n\nYour son\u2019s behavior was also awful. I hope you can get past your anger use this moment to teach him some life lessons. As bad as he\u2019s behaved he\u2019s 17 and they don\u2019t always have the best judgement. Talking to him while you are calm and making sure he understands that he should never jump to conclusions. That He should choose his words carefully, and that apologizing isn\u2019t enough at times. He needs to demonstrate to you that he has learned and grown from this experience. He should also be punished for his words and actions. Take away his electronics for 30 days or give him chores to do.\n\nEdited to add: find out how they got that picture. Whoever took that meant to harm you and you need to know.", "NTA. Your son has no respect for you (or for women, maybe?). I'm not sure just an apology is enough here, but I don't know how to bring that lesson home more effectively. \n\nDon't cut off your younger two. They are innocents here.", "NTA- I would be extremely hurt too, I can\u2019t believe they would think that of you. EVEN IF you were just out with your boss, that still could have just been business??? Insane", "NTA, although the fact that your husband seemed to not give you benefit of the doubt before discussing it with you is disconcerting, given the amount of time you've been together. Is there some underlying insecurity you might need to address with him, OP?\n\nHopefully your son has learned a lesson in how hurtful words can be, along with the dangers of making assumptions. Deep breaths, and wish you the best.", "NTA - teach your kids to stay out of grown folks business. Shame on your husband for involving the young ones and creating trauma instead of showing your hot headed 17 year old how a grown man is supposed to handle a sensitive situation. \n\nWhat kind of father is he letting his 17 year old take control of this whole drama? What a weak man. No wonder his son is running amok. He\u2019s got no real male role model in the home.", "NTA. I would\u2019ve been furious too. Hopefully this teaches your son about the danger of assumptions. This could have been handled differently. He could have approached you first, he could have curiously inquired what you did tonight. \n\nHe\u2019s old enough to realize the consequences of throwing accusations at people.", "NTA. I actually find your son jumping to conclusions more forgiveable than your husband not defending you. Unless you were kissing your boss in the photo, there's literally NO excuse for it. \n\nTake your time, and let them sweat it out while you chill down and relax. And then consider therapy to help you get past it. And consequences for what your son said. Regardless of what he thought was happening, what he said was hurtful, disrespectful and cruel and shouldn't be allowed to slide without consequences. \n\nI am inclined to say I wouldn't throw away my marriage over this misunderstanding, but my husband would have to work damn hard for forgiveness and earning back my trust if it were me.", "NTA \n\n17 is definitely a difficult age, however it is not young enough that he doesn't know better. He knew what he was saying and he didn't care, all he thought was that you did something that will destroy the family, and instead of asking he just decided to go into your home and announce it to everyone? Your son is the one with the AH behavior and needs a punishment. Looking at some of your replies, it seems your husband let an old supressed insecurity get the best of him. I'm not saying to forgive him, that is up to you if you can, but that should be something you should address in couples therapy. Really hope you can work things out and wish you all the best.", "Nta - your entire family freaked out over you having DINNER with someone??? They are ALL ridiculous.", "NTA\n\nNot very good at giving advice, so bear with me. \n\nI would explain to your son that what he did was wrong, that jumping to conclusions like that can and will destroy relationships, and often, those relationships can not be salvaged afterward. That a lot of the time people split because of situations like these. This doesn't just apply to you and your husband's relationship, but also any relationship your son has. That what someone says or does can ruin people's relationships, jobs, or reputation, and he should always hear both sides of the story before making that conclusion. I wouldn't fault your son for getting upset in the moment, he had no context for the situation, but how he handled it was wrong.\n\nYour husband, on the other hand, should've tried to de-escalate the situation, had your son go to his room, and asked about it when you got home. Your husband obviously still feels he can't trust you, and that is an issue he needs to fix, but he shouldn't have allowed your son to say the stuff he said. I'd be more hurt at not being trusted than being accused, as obviously he wasn't on your side from the start.", "I don't understand why your son didn't approach you in the restaurant. Mine would have, and I would have introduced him to my boss. If you were sneaking around, he would have caught you right then, but since you're innocent that would have cleared everything up immediately. This would have prevented all that trauma. As far as your dh, I would make him work his ass off to win me back. And I would insist he start keeping a calendar of events since his memory is crap. Had he been more in tune, that would have avoided the trauma too. Absolutely none of this is your fault.", "Your husband is the biggest AH and spineless. Even if it was true, he should NOT have handed it that way.

Your son has troubling language regarding women so I would also have him go to individual therapy.", "NTA\n\nJesus, that's horrible.", "NTA - and going by your comments, your son needs to be put in his place and learn how to respect his parents. Jumping to conclusions and telling your whole family before even confronting you, not cool.", "Holy hell, NTA.

It\u2019s one thing to be privately jealous or upset. It\u2019s another to allow this type of family communication breakdown. He\u2019s a grown ass man. Your son clearly seemed overly distressed. He skipped the mention it to mom or dad stage and went nuclear. There\u2019s no reason to do that unless he had prior knowledge or got a certain reaction from dad", "Does your son dislike you or hate you ?\n\nWhat is consuming online ?\n\nIs he turning into a incel or a misogynist ?", "Surely though you were sitting alone at a larger table or was this before you were seated. I can't imagine your husband just jumping to the same conclusion I can kinda see your son misunderstanding the situation (although a work meal with just your boss is also not inappropriate) but screaming at him was definitely justified!", "Agreed. My best friend from college is a (straight) male, and he and I have dinner at least once a month. We also go watch live local music together, as neither of our spouses like people much. People really think men and women can\u2019t have platonic relationships and it\u2019s WEIRD.\n\nOP, NTA, and I\u2019m sorry your family has treated you this way.", "Apparently not. And if he can so easily distrust you that\u2019s an issue.", "INFO: How recent was this breakup and relationship with another man?", "It's entirely possible he thought he did work through it but when your son announced to the whole household it may have shook him and fir him, you being with another man when y'all were broken up was clearly traumatic. He definitely needs to go back to therapy but I wouldn't necessarily not try to understand where he is coming from. On reddit, if roles were reversed, every woman on here would be screaming trauma...she has PTSD...I think it's definitely understandable to be upset angry and hurt but you seem empathetic enough to hopefully understand that how your son announced it may not have given him enough time to process it before he was totally shaken. \nI'm sorry if I'm not making sense lol. It sounds great in my head but I don't know if it's making sense writing it down lol. Btw you are NTA. :)", "When did that occur? Did you leave him when that happened or did he leave you? How long was the break for? If you had kids when it happened, who did they stay with? How old was your oldest when it happened? How long did you date this other man for? Is he still around somehow? How quickly after the break did you start to date and sleep with this other person?", "That\u2019s the piece I have trouble getting past. She comes home, and the husband is there with all three kids. Which says he dragged all of them into it instead of saying exactly what you stated above. Even if he thought they were cheating, you shut the kids down and you have a private conversation with your wife.", "Your son tried to split his parents up.\n\nWhat in sitcoms name..\n\nFor what it's worth OP I sure can't think if how one \"makes up\" for *this* besides your husband *and* child going to therepy to figure out why they seek a fight and their deductive reasoning is *this* bad.", "OP, while you have every right to be angry, you REALLY need to have a calm chat with your son (once things cool down) to understand this. A commenter above mentioned incel/misogynistic influences online; this could be a far reach, but it\u2019s important to understand how your 17yo immediately jumped this way. Maybe you and hubs fight in front of the kids more than you mean to? Maybe 17 was just cheated on by a gf/bf? \n\nThere\u2019s something else going on for sure, and more than likely he needs support to work through that \u2018something else\u2019 in a healthier way than accusing his mother baselessly.", "Ask your son if he watches Tate", "Men don\u2019t exactly get shamed for sex and even cheating the way women do. Hell, the kid jumped straight to calling his MOM a misogynistic slur without even knowing the full story. \n\nI think it\u2019s reasonable to question his level of respect for women.", "You broke up. You were single and available to date others. You did. \n\nI am suddenly seeing where your son is learning his slut shaming ways from.", "I was wondering the same thing. Realistically, this was an over the top reaction on all parts... So, why? Like I said, unless she's kissing her boss in this picture... or has a history of infidelity... I just can't fathom why her husband or son would jump so quickly to this conclusion and be *so certain* they were correct.", "Thank you, wasn't sure what else to add", "facts- i was so upset for her all i could think was \"nah\" as in \"nah to everything and this whole situation. just no no no NAH.\"", "I knew he called her a slut out of anger. Being mad back wouldn\u2019t have helped anything. Instead it would\u2019ve led to a shouting match. I would\u2019ve wanted to let him diffuse first before I spoke things out. Yes I would\u2019ve addressed the slut thing, but once things calmed down and after we\u2019ve both slept on it.", "He\u2019s probably reading a lot of Reddit posts. OP is NTA.", "I would also be worried about  this.  NTA.  And what on earth is wrong with the husband.", "Listening to Andrew Tate is where he learned misogyny. Browsing this sub is where he learned jumping to conclusions.", "Maybe couples therapy could do something for his insecurity?", "I agree with this. Obviously only OP knows the dynamics of their relationship. But I would imagine that if she was involved with another man during a break that it would always be raw for her husband. If you know you\u2019re innocent it can be infuriating to be accused but it\u2019s important to understand the spouse\u2019s perspective. He wasn\u2019t thinking straight and was obviously distraught. But if he can do easily believe this of you perhaps you need to look deeper, do you really have the right to be quite so indignant? \n\nI\u2019ll probably be downvoted for this because men aren\u2019t allowed to have feelings on Reddit but\u2026\n\nI\u2019ve posted before about my infidelity in my marriage and neither of you really gets over it, even if you\u2019re \u2018on a break\u2019. In my case there were extenuating circumstances and reasons but, whatever \u2018excuses\u2019 or circumstances there may be it shows you are able let someone get emotionally and physically in the spaces which should be reserved for your spouse. \n\nResolution takes communication and understanding. I was lucky that I have an incredibly understanding husband but I know that still, 11 years later, he can find things triggering. He is largely trusting and never makes me feel like the \u2018baddie\u2019 or like I\u2019m somehow less deserving of his love or anything, but I do my best to be an open book. He doesn\u2019t ask to look but I\u2019d have no problem with him checking my phone and socials, etc.\n\nIn other words, I understand I hurt him and do not have any moral high ground, even though he never makes me feel it, no one is beyond reproach. If he was suspicious I would try to be patient, understanding and reassuring. Yes he\u2019s insecure, and for good reason. He sounds like a feeling and emotional man, reassurance may be the price you have to pay for the past if you want to make the marriage work. If your can\u2019t do that perhaps you don\u2019t care enough about him?  Again, only you know what the dynamics of your relationship are like the memories of infidelity are long and the hurt easily underestimated.\n\nI look at my marriage like a beautiful vase that o cracked. It\u2019s my job to make sure I handle it with extreme care and love if I want to keep it in one piece. And I do.\n\nThere is no excuse for the son\u2019s language but stories of infidelity are everywhere and he sounds like a dramatic and, at the time, betrayed teenager\n\nNAH Reddit likes things to be black and white and it\u2019s not always like that.", "Guarantee you the dad told his son about his moms previous \u201cother partner\u201d.", "\ud83c\udfc5", "No worries. I assumed that it was like \u201cnah bro\u201d but wanted to be sure", "He\u2019s already been in it she says. She says she thought he\u2019d worked through it and put it behind him. Although if they were broken up I\u2019m not sure why it was so traumatic that she was involved with someone else. She says they were broken up at hen time it happened", "I really hope that the Dad didn\u2019t tell the kids about that. Plus it\u2019s not like she did anything wrong if they were broken up at the time.\n\nMy own parent didn\u2019t tell me the full details of why they and my other parent split up until I was an adult, just so it wouldn\u2019t warp my own opinion (growing up) of my other parent. One of the maturest things they could have done.", "My stalker said I cheated on her about 6 months into her stalking after she refused to break up with me.  Continued stalking for two years.\n\nSome people are just messed up.", "I think regular therapy and couples therapy is a bit different. \n\nIdk about tramatic but I've been with a couple guys like that, it isn't about the fact she wasn't with him at the time, it's the fact that they had been together(and I'm assuming since they were 15, her first) however many times at that point, guys like that tend to think 'well if I've been with you why do you need to be with anyone else, aren't I good enough?' Or perhaps it's the fact she wanted to be with anyone else other than him. Some men are just insecure, especially if they learn that the woman they love has been with other men. This is something OP should really think about before discussing it with her husband, I know I'd ask him why he couldn't trust me after all these years of being faithful to him", "My parents definitely gave me all the dirty details, and honestly it\u2019s an issue! They\u2019ve gotten back together and broken up multiple times and I can\u2019t fathom why they\u2019d stay together. Anyways, I have a hunch that the kid was told, he went off on her very fast. Regardless, I feel like everyone would benefit from personal and family counseling whether or not the parents stay together.", "Wow. That must have been rough.", "Yes. They definitely will have to reach a resolution.", "Yeah, it wasn't nice.  In the end I flew to another country for three months and then returned to a different house.  Really tiring and there was absolutely no support.  The most unfair thing is that I bore all of the risk and cost, and she lost nothing and had zero risk with her ridiculous behavior.", "thanks for the kind words, too.  All good now, but it has been a long road getting back to normal for me."]}
