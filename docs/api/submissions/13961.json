He's a very active child and spends most of his time at school or out with friends, this never bothers me since he tells me who he's out with and when he'll be getting home. A few weeks ago my boss announced we broke our latest sales record so he would be taking us all out to dinner on Friday the 31st. We were all pretty excited since we don't do the typical \"team building\" excursions that other jobs hold. I had informed my husband of this but he has a very bad memory, I'm convinced he'd lose his head if it weren't attached to his body. Well, Friday came and we all went to dinner straight from work at a local Chinese buffet, as time passed everyone had their fill and left. By the time I left, it was only my boss and me. He thanked me for my hard work as he had done with my other coworkers and we went our separate ways for the night. When I got home I knew something was wrong.

It doesn\u2019t matter if he forgot you had a dinner with workmates, doesn\u2019t he trust you?  And even if he did think something was off, it was not okay to have your kids involved. I understand why it might be hard for you to get past that. I know it would be hard for me to forgive the complete lack of trust. \n\nYour son\u2019s behavior was also awful. I hope you can get past your anger use this moment to teach him some life lessons. As bad as he\u2019s behaved he\u2019s 17 and they don\u2019t always have the best judgement. Talking to him while you are calm and making sure he understands that he should never jump to conclusions. That He should choose his words carefully, and that apologizing isn\u2019t enough at times. He needs to demonstrate to you that he has learned and grown from this experience. He should also be punished for his words and actions. Take away his electronics for 30 days or give him chores to do.\n\nEdited to add: find out how they got that picture. Whoever took that meant to harm you and you need to know.", "NTA. Your son has no respect for you (or for women, maybe?). I'm not sure just an apology is enough here, but I don't know how to bring that lesson home more effectively. \n\nDon't cut off your younger two. They are innocents here.", "NTA- I would be extremely hurt too, I can\u2019t believe they would think that of you. EVEN IF you were just out with your boss, that still could have just been business??? Insane", "NTA, although the fact that your husband seemed to not give you benefit of the doubt before discussing it with you is disconcerting, given the amount of time you've been together. Is there some underlying insecurity you might need to address with him, OP?\n\nHopefully your son has learned a lesson in how hurtful words can be, along with the dangers of making assumptions. Deep breaths, and wish you the best.", "NTA - teach your kids to stay out of grown folks business. Shame on your husband for involving the young ones and creating trauma instead of showing your hot headed 17 year old how a grown man is supposed to handle a sensitive situation. \n\nWhat kind of father is he letting his 17 year old take control of this whole drama? What a weak man. No wonder his son is running amok. He\u2019s got no real male role model in the home.", "NTA. I would\u2019ve been furious too. Hopefully this teaches your son about the danger of assumptions. This could have been handled differently. He could have approached you first, he could have curiously inquired what you did tonight. \n\nHe\u2019s old enough to realize the consequences of throwing accusations at people.", "NTA. I actually find your son jumping to conclusions more forgiveable than your husband not defending you. Unless you were kissing your boss in the photo, there's literally NO excuse for it. \n\nTake your time, and let them sweat it out while you chill down and relax. And then consider therapy to help you get past it. And consequences for what your son said. Regardless of what he thought was happening, what he said was hurtful, disrespectful and cruel and shouldn't be allowed to slide without consequences. \n\nI am inclined to say I wouldn't throw away my marriage over this misunderstanding, but my husband would have to work damn hard for forgiveness and earning back my trust if it were me.", "NTA \n\n17 is definitely a difficult age, however it is not young enough that he doesn't know better. He knew what he was saying and he didn't care, all he thought was that you did something that will destroy the family, and instead of asking he just decided to go into your home and announce it to everyone? Your son is the one with the AH behavior and needs a punishment. Looking at some of your replies, it seems your husband let an old supressed insecurity get the best of him. I'm not saying to forgive him, that is up to you if you can, but that should be something you should address in couples therapy. Really hope you can work things out and wish you all the best.", "Nta - your entire family freaked out over you having DINNER with someone??? They are ALL ridiculous.", "NTA\n\nNot very good at giving advice, so bear with me. \n\nI would explain to your son that what he did was wrong, that jumping to conclusions like that can and will destroy relationships, and often, those relationships can not be salvaged afterward. That a lot of the time people split because of situations like these. This doesn't just apply to you and your husband's relationship, but also any relationship your son has. That what someone says or does can ruin people's relationships, jobs, or reputation, and he should always hear both sides of the story before making that conclusion. I wouldn't fault your son for getting upset in the moment, he had no context for the situation, but how he handled it was wrong.\n\nYour husband, on the other hand, should've tried to de-escalate the situation, had your son go to his room, and asked about it when you got home. Your husband obviously still feels he can't trust you, and that is an issue he needs to fix, but he shouldn't have allowed your son to say the stuff he said. I'd be more hurt at not being trusted than being accused, as obviously he wasn't on your side from the start.", "I don't understand why your son didn't approach you in the restaurant. Mine would have, and I would have introduced him to my boss. If you were sneaking around, he would have caught you right then, but since you're innocent that would have cleared everything up immediately. This would have prevented all that trauma. As far as your dh, I would make him work his ass off to win me back. And I would insist he start keeping a calendar of events since his memory is crap. Had he been more in tune, that would have avoided the trauma too. Absolutely none of this is your fault.", "Your husband is the biggest AH and spineless. Even if it was true, he should NOT have handed it that way.

Your son has troubling language regarding women so I would also have him go to individual therapy.", "NTA\n\nJesus, that's horrible.", "NTA - and going by your comments, your son needs to be put in his place and learn how to respect his parents. Jumping to conclusions and telling your whole family before even confronting you, not cool.", "Holy hell, NTA.

On reddit, if roles were reversed, every woman on here would be screaming trauma...she has PTSD...I think it's definitely understandable to be upset angry and hurt but you seem empathetic enough to hopefully understand that how your son announced it may not have given him enough time to process it before he was totally shaken. \nI'm sorry if I'm not making sense lol.

If you know you\u2019re innocent it can be infuriating to be accused but it\u2019s important to understand the spouse\u2019s perspective. He wasn\u2019t thinking straight and was obviously distraught. But if he can do easily believe this of you perhaps you need to look deeper, do you really have the right to be quite so indignant? \n\nI\u2019ll probably be downvoted for this because men aren\u2019t allowed to have feelings on Reddit but\u2026\n\nI\u2019ve posted before about my infidelity in my marriage and neither of you really gets over it, even if you\u2019re \u2018on a break\u2019.

I was lucky that I have an incredibly understanding husband but I know that still, 11 years later, he can find things triggering. He is largely trusting and never makes me feel like the \u2018baddie\u2019 or like I\u2019m somehow less deserving of his love or anything, but I do my best to be an open book. He doesn\u2019t ask to look but I\u2019d have no problem with him checking my phone and socials, etc.\n\nIn other words, I understand I hurt him and do not have any moral high ground, even though he never makes me feel it, no one is beyond reproach. If he was suspicious I would try to be patient, understanding and reassuring. Yes he\u2019s insecure, and for good reason. He sounds like a feeling and emotional man, reassurance may be the price you have to pay for the past if you want to make the marriage work.

Or perhaps it's the fact she wanted to be with anyone else other than him. Some men are just insecure, especially if they learn that the woman they love has been with other men.

It almost sounds like your husband sent him there, to \u201ccatch\u201d you. I hope you\u2019re making them both sweat it, until you calm down. Then, I\u2019d absolutely DEMAND your husband goes to counseling. I\u2019d think your son may benefit as well. He jumped right on the \u201cyou\u2019re a slut\u201d train. That\u2019s not ok to call anyone that. It\u2019s misogynistic. Although it\u2019s a teachable moment for your son. Your husband\u2026\u2026 yeah I\u2019d reconsider the entire marriage after that. He can\u2019t get over the fact you dated someone else when you were broken up? That\u2019s ridiculous. I can understand feeling a sting, but he\u2019s obviously got much bigger issues.", "NTA\n\nAlso actions, and lack of actions, have consequences.

But your son and husband are.", "Regardless of your husbands insecurity, your son shouldn\u2019t have reacted that way and your husband shouldn\u2019t have put those insecurities on your son! He should have handled such a situation much better than letting your son overreact that way! So yeah you are definitely NTA but I would worry about how your son treats other women/girls if he is that fast to jump to conclusions!", "NTA- Your son is old enough to have handled this with more sensitivity. I\u2019m most disappointed in your husband for going along with this ambush. \n\nI would recommend that you sit down with your son and explain how irresponsible it was for him to jump to this conclusion and how inappropriate calling you names is. I wouldn\u2019t sugar coat the fact that your marriage could have broken irrevocably because of his hair trigger actions. He seems to want to be a big bad adult, don\u2019t hide the very real potential consequences from him.", "NTA. 19 Needs to move out, consequences you know. Hubby needs a date book that you fill in.", "NTA and I'm so sorry this happened to you", "NTA but I do need info! \n\nwhere did your son learn to be so disrespectful toward women? Calling his own mother a slut? This really worries me not only because he called you a slut but because he found you, hid and took photos then went home and told everyone including his siblings. He is clearly looking for drama or attention.. if you don\u2019t usually have any issue with him then I think you might need to spend more time with him because something else could be going on. \n\nIs there a reason he would jump to infidelity so quick? I would be wondering if something was going on with one of his friends parents or he himself was cheated on recently.", "Sheesh, that remark is a slapping offense\u2026", "NTA and you do not have a son problem, you have a husband problem.  What is he saying to your kids?", "NTA. But your son and husband certainly are. Your son was clearly out of bounds. jumping to that conclusion and calling you a slut was seriously disrespectful and he should have been raised better. Your husband believing that, forgetful or not, and involving the kids was totally off the wall after your time together. I really doubt I could resolve that lack of trust and disrespect from my family.  Therapy would be mandatory, and time apart optional.", "Does any of this really seem real? I may be rather sinical but you were alone with your boss for long enough that he walked in saw you took a picture and left.\n\nOnce he left he managed to beat you home with enough time to go through this with your partner and he is so forgetful he goes straight to cheating instead of remembering you are going out for work.", "NTA\n\nMake your husband move out. Send your son to a relative's house for a month.\n\nthis is seriously a marriage ending issue (at least for me), as I would no longer trust my partner. The husband automatically jumped to \"my wife is cheating\" instead of defending his partner of 20 years. When trust is gone, I can't stay married to the person.\n\nHow can you ever trust the husband again knowing that he never trusted you and still considers you to have cheated by having had a relationship when you were broken up in your teens?  \n\nHow can you trust a partner who clearly has told your son that you cheated on him? (or else why would your child think cheater, someone, probably spouse said you were a previous cheater to son)\n\nThis is also a relationship suspended issue with the son.  He saw op sitting at a table with another man and jumped to \"my mother is a slut.\"  The son needs therapy, and a hard look at himself.", "NTA but....

Do you know what kind of content they watch? This is giving me manosphere vibes", "I love my kid more than anything else in the world and generally don\u2019t yell at him but oof, I\u2019d have lost my shit.  I hate to say it but I think this would fundamentally alter my relationship with both the kid and husband in this scenario\u2026 I don\u2019t think any amount of therapy would help me forget how quick and easy it was for both of them to turn on me\u2026", "NTA \n\nThis is very worrying behavior from both your son and husband. Why did he immediately jump to infidelity and why was your husband so willingly to be believe him that fast without even getting your part????? Definitely need to talk to both of them and possibly see what your son is getting into online.\n\nAdd on: Read a few comments and I\u2019m inclined to believe that your husband has a hand in what your son thought. What made me believe this is that they had no problem in involving the youngest kids in this mess right away. Those kids must have been heartbroken and scared that the family was going to rip apart. Your husband and son should apologize to them too.", "NTA! its quite strange how fast he jumped toward you cheating on your husband. Perhaps he is doing the same to his girlfriend?", "Holy. That's a strong NTA and I'd be seriously considering separation right now. \n\nI'd also be explaining to your jerk son that his attitude toward women is incredibly wrong, and that if he doesn't fix it immediately, he will eventually end up alone and bitter because no woman would tolerate that crap from her partner.", "NTA? wtf?", "I read your comments, quite apparently the son knows about your break up and sleeping with another man. You were broken up with your husband at the time so it\u2019s not wrong. The number of men you slept with has no bearing on anything because you\u2019ve never cheated on your husband. If you choose to go back to your husband, I would insist on couples counseling because there\u2019s quite obviously still issues from your break up. There wasn\u2019t on your side it seems until now. Your husband did a good job creating the problem. If you indeed screamed at your son (I often on this sub wonder if people are truly screaming because it\u2019s used so often or if they just raised their voice which is different) I don\u2019t actually approve because screaming should only be used in times of danger. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily make you TA either. Your son just accused you of something horrible and called you a horrible name besides so I understand the actual anger you probably felt. NTA. If you go back to your husband, do it with the condition of counseling for the both of you and maybe family counseling for you and your oldest although after the horrible accusations you might find it helpful for the younger ones because they might not know how to handle the feelings they might feel at this whole debacle! Good luck!", "NTA at all. Your son was out of line and your husband is a TA for not being more in tune with your plans. \n\nWhy did your son have a photo of you and your boss though?", "NTA shame on your son for jumping to conclusions and telling the whole family, and shame on your husband for immediately believing him.  I don't blame you one bit for being furious, and I'd be very concerned that your son is exhibiting some incel characteristics.", "NTA. Your son is. Wow. First of all? Your marriage is none of his business until it needs to be. \nAnd he called you out if your name for no reason? Oh I wouldn't slapped him right across the face.", "NTA. What your son did was wrong and your husband's poor memory is no excuse. I would have a talk with your son about how what he did was wrong and the language that he used was extremely inappropriate. Make it clear that you never want to hear him use that kind of language again. Ground him for two or so weeks. I would also look into what he is getting up to online and what kind of crowd he is hanging around. If he is into the incel community, if he listens to Andrew Tate, I would shut that down hard and fast. Make it clear to him that those people are misogynists and not to be trusted or believed.\n\nAs for your husband, you need to have a serious discussion with him about his reaction. How it was entirely inappropriate and uncalled for to bring your younger two children into, how he should have shut your older son down and talked to you when you got home like adults. I would tell him that he needs to start going to therapy again and that you need to go to couples therapy together to work through his issues. He also needs to work on his memory issues. You told him where you were going and because he couldn't be bothered to remember what you told him, it added fuel to the fire.", "NTA\n\nAlso obviously it was a work dinner your husband was aware of\u2026. But if it wasn\u2019t, can\u2019t one get dinner with a friend of the opposite sex\u2026.\n\nTo jump to cheating is absolutely fucking insane!\n\nEdit: spelling error", "NTA but I blame your husband more. He has no excuse for not remembering, and shouldn't have taken your son at face value.", "I mean NTA for yelling at the son, but let's be real, you're angry right now, rightfully so, but YTA if you don't forgive your son for being a dumb teenager eventually.  As dumb as this situation is, you're a mother, and obviously there are some quirks with your son, try to resolve that so he can grow up to be a better person.\n\nDon't hold too much against your husband either, he wasn't aggressively accusing you, he had been provided a narrative and some \"evidence\" from your son, and of course that can be a lot to hear if you feel like it's coming out of left field.  You yourself said your husband might lose his head if it weren't attached, so he probably wasn't super analytical when his own son, which he probably didn't think to be skeptical of, was ambushing him with this stuff.\n\nI'm not saying it makes it right, just that it's not as evil as you might feel it is.", "NTA, I\u2019d take the younger two and go somewhere to cool off for a couple of weeks. Also to stress to your husband and oldest son that this is a serious issue and it can\u2019t just be solved by an apology. What they did was terrible. Poor memory issues isn\u2019t an excuse, it\u2019s just incompetence and frankly inexcusable. There are so many ways including a smartphone to help a person remember tasks. Why your son just jumped to that conclusion is an issue in itself that you need to look into. Could be your husband, social media, friends\u2026 He needs to do more than just an apology and letting this drop.", "NTA! I suggest you take some time away from your family. It\u2019s clear they don\u2019t appreciate you if they were so quick to shame/turn against you. Go to a hotel or stay with family/friends until you have calmed down. You need to have a discussion with your husband as to why he was so quick to believe your son especially when he should know your routine. As for you son, he needs to be punished. For him to slut shame you and disrespect you so easily, he needs to be put in his place. I wish you all the best. Also, maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m young, unmarried and not a mother. But, I would have broken up with my husband then and there.", "Your son called you a slut to your face. Your. SON. Called. You. A. Slut. To. Your. Face. And...your husband did nothing. NOTHING! The level of disrespect shown for you is galling! NTA that's for sure!\n\nYou said that you might not be able to forgive them. I don't blame you. Right now, extending forgiveness is a goal for the bottom of your list. Right now, you have bigger issues with them. \n\nFirst of all, what caused your son to jump to the conclusion that he did? What were his influences? Did one of his friends walk in on a cheating parent? Is he listening to incel or misogynistic podcasts? Did your husband actually not \"forget\" about the dinner and send your son over there to spy on you?\n\nSecondly, why didn't your husband defend you? Why did he just accept what your son said at face value? You saw someone else WHEN YOU TWO HAD BROKEN UP. You were free to enter another relationship, you had that right. It looks to me as if your husband looks at this situation like an act of infidelity...STILL...and that's a serious problem! He was so quick to accept the word of a teenage boy who called his mother a slut, that one wonders what is going on with him. I mean, he didn't even speak out at such disrespect. \n\nMay I suggest that you establish some firm boundaries before you even consider going \"home\"? Consider going home ONLY ON THE CONDITION THAT all parties attend family therapy. Them-and only then-will you come home. And don't worry about forgiving ANYONE until you've worked through the issues.

I have ADHD and forget a lot of things. Which is why a) I know not to trust my memory and b) have gotten help for it. How can this dude react like that?! Even if he hadn't forgotten it that's still a very weird reaction, but even more so, I can't imagine assuming things without going \"hey, honey, did you mention something about going out today?\"  \n\nAnd yeah, as you said, even if that wasn't a factor, why would he instantly believe something like that without questioning it and without asking her about it? Not to mention the son's reaction, who just SAW them on a business dinner and was sure they cheated AND decided to say it in front of everyone.", "For real! I'm a woman and my current boss is a man. We're usually the only people who go into the office so we end up having lunch together a lot. There's nothing going on between us, not just because it would lead to him probably losing his job but because he's GAY lol. \n\nPeople who see others of the opposite sex together and make assumptions are hilarious in how small minded they are.", "I would also suggest a separate conversation with the son about why that word is in mouth in a derogatory way & why it was so easy for him to level at his mother.

NTA.", "OP, your son saw you eating dinner with a man and automatically assumed you were having an affair. This is insane by itself. He took it further, he told everyone and then called you a slut - a filthy, derogatory term in front of your entire family. Your son called you slut because he saw you eating dinner with someone of the opposite sex. He has such little respect for you that he filled in all the blanks and called you a slut - the woman who gave birth to him. I would be so disappointed in him. I would drive home the point over and over again how he was being sexist to his own mother. How you cannot let this go easily because he is getting older and needs to learn a lesson. How disappointed you are that he has such little respect for you. And how cowardly it was to take a photo and cause a stir in the household you made with your husband.\n\nAs for your husband, he's a fool. Seeing a photo of you eating with your boss should not equal you having an affair. I eat with coworkers all the time, and my husband thinks nothing of it. He has no faith in you as a wife, and to allow your son to rant and rave about a freaking dinner - he should be ashamed of himself. He should have stopped this right when it started and not allow it to get to this point. He should have told the son that he would talk to you when you got home and that he needed to shut his mouth and not accuse you of something dirty because of a mere photo of a dinner.\n\nYou mentioned that before you got married you briefly broke up and you dated and had sex with another man. Who gives a crap. That happens. You were not in a relationship at the time, and you do not deserve the disrespect you were shown by the 2 men in your life. They need to both grovel and rethink their treatment of women.", "I guess it was too hard to go over and TALK TO  YOU IN PERSON...when he could just take a photo and slink out the door.

Just hanging out with someone of the opposite sex equals slut.  Guess her son thinks women should have a male escort from the family to avoid such confusion.  Maybe make it so that women can\u2019t work, that would solve it.  The fact that the Dad was in the living room hugging the kids tells me he already made up his mind on a picture of two coworkers out to dinner.  And he can\u2019t care enough to remember important events.  But of course she just laughs it off, she lives with a misogynist who would believe his teenage son over his wife of over 20 years.

If OP has to stay late at work, do they have to leave the extra work for later, even if it's time sensitive? I get where you're coming from but it's a bit victim blame-y and is putting the responsibility for the relationship solely on one partner, in this instance specifically the wife and that's not cool.
