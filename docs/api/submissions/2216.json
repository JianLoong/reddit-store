Don't be shocked this is just how things are done in my culture. (My fiance has also moved back with her parents until all this is over).  \n\nI have absolutely no problem with here bringing her bf around and I think neither do my parents. But my aunt and uncle certainly do. I've even heard them whispering that what effect this might have on the younger cousins when they heard he was coming. \n\nI tried to placate everyone and distract them with my wedding plans and it worked. However when my sister got here things got a little more complicated. Sister came home to a warm welcome and it wasn't that awkward with aunt and uncle and her bf either. \n\nBut when she saw the sleeping arrangements her face fell. I was bunking with another male cousin. My parents and aunt and uncle got a room each and there was another bedroom for her to share with 2 female cousins. She got annoyed and asked what her bf was supposed to do. I told her we can set up the couch for him.\n\nThis irritated her and she said she'd sleep on the couch out with him. I flat out refused as what would our parents and aunt and uncle think.\n\nShe then said she didn't like that he'd be on the couch and that she'd get a comfy bed even if she's sharing. I told her this was out of the question and that she's behaving like a brat.\n\nThen she suggested the cousin I was bunking with and her bf take turns on the couch (in our culture the wedding can last for a few days). I refused this as well because well my cousin brother is my buddy and I don't want to share space with her bf who is practically a stranger.\n\nSis started getting angry at this point and yelling at me asking why the hell did I say she was allowed to bring someone then. I told her she could bring someone for the wedding and not to my house.\n\nShe got even angry at this and told me I know Indian weddings last for 4-5 days and where was he to go during the wedding functions as they can't afford a hotel for those many days.\n\nI told her this wasn't my problem and that she's forgotten our culture. There's no way my parents would accept her sleeping on the couch with her bf. \n\nShe flipped me off and told me if she doesn't get to stay with her bf or if my cousin doesn't alternate, she'll leave. I told her i would be a waste of travel expenses and time and to stop behaving like a brat.\n\nBf at this point butt in and said he's perfectly happy on the couch.

You offered them somewhere to stay for free if the accommodations are not to her liking she can leave.", "NTA\n\nThis would have caused a lot of drama at your wedding. Yeah, we may or may not disagree with some stuff in our cultures, but someone else\u2019s celebration is not the time to take a stand.\n\nYou can\u2019t sleep with a random dude next to you. She has a bed and BF has a couch and it\u2019s free. If they cared so much about sleeping arrangements in a wedding house they should have checked in with you beforehand.", "YTA for at least not considering letting your cousin and the bf switch couch and bed every other night", "NTA.  I was anticipating going the other direction from the title.  But your issue is the very high number of house guests consistent with a cultural expectation.  You\u2019ve been forced to pack the house.  A bedroom for the male cousins, a bedroom for the female cousins, bedrooms for the older generation, and a separate space for the boyfriend.  If your cousin wanted to stay at your place, she should have inquired of sleeping arrangements.  If she was dissatisfied with them, she could go elsewhere.", "YTA. You knew the wedding will last for days, so of course he'd need a comfortable space to sleep. And she didn't invite a random date - she invited her partner, which you also knew about. You're honestly too locked up in people's judgements to give your sister any consideration, but since she's right in her demands you're writing her off as a brat.\n\nYou could have handled this in 20 other ways. But you chose the typical desi guy route - dismiss the person causing you issues on something as minor as alternate sleeping arrangements. Isn't our culture also big on hospitality? Would make sense to remember that. Make the poor guy feel welcome, groom-zilla.", "NTA.   You are providing a free place for them to stay.   If they don\u2019t like the sleeping arrangements you\u2019re providing, they need to pay for a hotel.  It\u2019s not unreasonable to ask them to respect your family\u2019s culture by not sleeping together for a few days while at your house.", "Ehh it's a tricky one. I'd say NAH only because I know what indian weddings are like since I'm indian too but at the same time I'm more progressive and not very traditional.\n\n It's not a huge deal for people to sleep on the floor when you're all living together so sleeping on the couch isn't anything special. \n\nAt the same time your sister probably feels like you're purposely excluding her BF since everyone gets a bed except for him. And while he isn't family he is still a guest and it's not polite to treat a guest like an outsider, especially when they're someone close to your sister", "I\u2019ll probably get flack over this but I\u2019m going to go with NTA- every culture is different and they\u2019re not married. If they want to sleep together they should get a hotel or an air bnb. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re not going to spend time together during the day. It\u2019s only for a few days.

Hope it works out for those two.", "You sound pretty condescending yourself.", "YTA. JFC with you people trying to control where couples sleep together", "NTA. It's pretty bold of her to add an uninvited guest to an already crowded house. Beggars can't be choosers. She deals with bf on the couch or she can go home.", "NTA. I understand the cultural demands. Your sister should as well having been raised that way. Instead of it being more of what your parents and aunt and uncle think, it\u2019s more of a respect thing for the older generation. It is also a cultural thing in my family as well. You just don\u2019t do it. It\u2019s your home.

She can eke out 4 nights w/o sleeping with her bf.", "YTA she is not acting like a brat, she just wants to be treated like an adult, without the cultural/religious BS being forced on her", "NTA she can get a hotel if she wants. Your house your rules. You don't want drama during your wedding.

How pathetic", "NTA.  You are trying to avoid offending so many people.   Expecting sister AH to observe social constricts adhered to by other relatives is completely reasonable.   IMO sister and bf would best be required to stay somewhere other than the family residence.  Sister is clearly the AH here.", "NTA your house and wedding, your rules.  And if you wish to make those rules based on respect for your elders and your culture, that's your right.", "NTA.  You are being reasonable and have offered a compromise. There is only so much space in the house.  Since you say packing the house is common in your culture, then she should've known that she would need to be flexible about sleeping arrangements.  Where you went wrong is that you should have given your sister a heads up about the fact that she would not be sleeping with her bf -- unlike past times when she slept with her boyfriend in your house.  But at this point, if she doesn't like it, then she should get a hotel.", "Yta...who are you to tell a grown up if she sleeps in a bed with her boyfriend .\nDoes she have to be married or will they be seperate then too?\nWho cares what someone else thinks thats her problem not yours.", "YTA\n\nSo your sister expecting her boyfriend to not sleep on the couch is unreasonable to you? She's not even acting like a brat, she just doesn't want her boyfriend to sleep on the couch. \n\nLet's be honest, you care more about what your family thinks then your sister's feelings.", "Really weird to see \"they are 23 and adults... YTA\" judgements here all over the place because it they apply their culture \"rules and norma\" to this situation.\n\nBut your \"+1 does not apply to staying with us\" and him being the only one not having a bed kinda makes you the AH.\nYou squeeze you sister in with 2 other cousins but can't make room for him?\nWhy are you not taking the couch yourself as the host which in my opinion would be the best way to do it.\n\nShe's just upset that you treat him as a second class guest and not that they just can't sleep together. YTA\n\nI'd hope they remember this if they ever marry and put you on the couch while your wife has a bed", "YTA. Oh my goodness. They're adults, & quite honestly, its time for you to pull up your big boy panties & not care what other people think. Other peoples opinions don't pay bills. And cultures only matter for the one celebrating it... Not for everyone else.", "She wants her BF to feel respected and valued. She obviously cares about him.

Your house, your rules. If she doesn\u2019t like it, she can leave. \n\nMy parents aren\u2019t overly religious, but they still don\u2019t want me or my sister sleeping in the same bed as our partner while staying at their house.

You\u2019re being ridiculous! YTA.", "NTA. She knows and understands her culture. I am not of the same culture but I would NEVER force my mother to accept me and my bf in the same bed, not even at 49 years old. If she doesn't like the sleeping arrangements she can sleep elsewhere.

It sounds like she's used to getting what she wants and to keep peace and tensions down, the sleeping arrangements need to stay the same.", "Esh. Her because she should have checked the arrangements before she left and should defer to the preferences of her host or stay home. You because you don't actually care if she sleeps with her bf, only what your family will think. Plus the cheap shot about forgetting her culture. Sounds like you resent her independence.", "Nta.

You\u2019re being gracious enough to let him crash at your house even though they are not married. Is she co-dependent? Is it not enough to be in the same house for 4-5 days?

Her bf doesn\u2019t seem to mind being on the couch, so hopefully  he can talk sense into her. Please don\u2019t let her ruin your wedding week. And if she leaves bc of this, then so be it.

She's not even saying she wants to fuck him all night, she even asked why he couldn't be in YOUR SHARED ROOM. the original commenter said your sister is sneaky, but really it's you. You're the one who wants to pretend to be accepting and liberal, you're now hiding behind your aunts and uncles and culture to treat someone you invited into your home like shit. If you were so busy you couldn't ask 2 follow up questions when she asked if she could bring a plus 1, then then you should've told her up front then and there. Now, you get to continue to be liberal and force her bf to sleep on the couch, while her bf has to be humiliated because if you don't think your aunts and uncles will have something to say about him for even sleeping on the couch, then you're lying to me and to yourself. \n\nAnd before you say one word about culture and expectations, let me say I am Indian. If I or my family cared enough to influence my decisions, I would have communicated that WHILE ASKED ABOUT THE +1. You don't get a pass for being \"too busy\", this is your event and these are your guests. Then why even have an event? Just do whatever you want by yourself. I think you're quite weird and wanton for how desperate you are for the approval of small minded people. And quite pathetic for the lack of hospitality you have displayed. Hope your wedding and appeasing your shitty relatives was worth it to you.\n\nEdit: I see you say in your comments that she should not be \"stoking the fire\" - what you don't understand is that the fire will be stoked no matter what. She's just enjoying her life with her bf and this is apparently gossip fodder - and as someone who comes from a conservative society, I know firsthand how annoying it is to have every single thing you do be used against you just because it's different from everyone else's expectations. And I almost bought your liberal act, until you started using words like \"wanton\" and \"stoking a fire\" for...wanting her bf to have a bed and posting some pictures? If you go to great lengths to accommodate someone's sensitivities, then you probably agree with them. I'm sure the LGBTQ+ community is looked down upon in your society; if you came here and asked the same question but with a gf instead of a bf, everyone here would be telling you that your efforts to do so would mean you are probably homophobic too. That's exactly how I see this situation, no one who truly is liberal would see her posting pictures and living her life as \"stoking the fire\".", "My husband and I lived together for several years before we married.  His parents and siblings are very religious. We would no more have slept together at any of their homes than we would have done drugs in their homes.

She wouldn't have traveled there at all with different knowledge.", "Shouldn't you have had the conversation before she brought him then? It seemed like you discussed her bringing  before they came, but maybe I read that incorrectly.", "Then why did you give her a plus one?", "So you'd rather sleep in a bed with your cousin than share the uncomfortable couch with your soon to be wife you love?", "She\u2019s not allowed to date?", "That changes nothing. Culture, tradition, older generations, you have to accept and respect because it\u2019s NOT YOUR HOUSE. NTA again.", "She is not being punished. OMG!  What about the fact this is HIS home. She had the obligation to check whim first.", "Why is the sister just making assumptions? I feel like if I was traveling to stay at someone else\u2019s house, I would ask what the sleeping arrangements would be.\n\nI actually backed out of a cottage weekend I was invited to because I was told I could only have access to a bed for one night and then have to trade off with someone else and sleep on the porch or the floor or something the second night. I chose to stay home instead.", "It's not a punishment to be told there isn't a bed available for someone who is uninvited. Sister dropped the ball, it's her culture she should have known that the house would already be crowded.", "Sister isn\u2019t being punished, she brought an extra guest to her brother\u2019s home, and since he was an uninvited and unexpected guest he didn\u2019t have an available bed to sleep on. Sister was meant to share a bed in a room with the female cousins, which is still available, but she wants to punish her male cousin by kicking him out of the bed he was given for her unexpected guest. Her sister didn\u2019t say her boyfriend was spending the night, and OP and his parents don\u2019t deserve getting trash-talked for his sister\u2019s wish to sleep on the couch with him.", "No not really but I just think she could do better", "I get all that I really do! I've been a very liberal brother to her. Just... she already lives with him in her city and posts pics of it on Instagram and our family's already talking about it. Of course, we won't force her. But why stroke the fire? why give them more gossip?", "He. Wasn't. Invited. To. The. House. Just the wedding. When I receive a wedding invitation I don't assume I can move in with the groom for the duration and without a heads up.", "Incorrect. She is trying to walk all over her brother and disrespected him in his own home.", "It is HIS house. NOT hers.", "How is this comment still here? Mods you love to ban me for the stupidest shit but this comment is still here?", "Do it elsewhere", "Invitation to stay at someone\u2019s house is direct ergo she should have asked for permission to bring him.

But equally OP should have told her the sleeping arrangements before she showed up given he knew this was going to be the an issue (also, he\u2019s said bf isn\u2019t good enough for sister, so it does feel a bit like he is trying to punish bf). It\u2019s too late now they\u2019ve shown up as they can\u2019t afford to pay for a hotel, but if they had known in advance bf could have made the decision not to come, or they both could have not come, or booked a hotel further in advance at a cheaper rate.\n\nESH. This was completely avoidable and just needed better communication!", "That sounds like a yes. You don't \"dislike\" him but think he's not good enough", "And you live with your fianc\u00e9e.", "I don't think you're TA in this specific situation but I must admit I really disagre with your patronizing attitude towards your sister in general. What do you mean, you have been a \"very liberal brother\" to her? How is it any of your business how she leads her life while she's not a guest in your house?\n\nAnd as your fiancee is obviously living with you prior to being married, how can you feel entitled to judge your sister for living with her boyfriend?", "That's definitely a cultural thing I don't experience, so will refrain from passing judgement. I understand that there is more difficulty  with how the extended family feel than I might perceive  since it wouldn't be much of an issue in my culture. \n\nI live in a relatively diverse area and have been invited to 4 of 5 days of a Hindi wedding. I've also had lengthy conversations about Indian culture with older Indian women who may be a little more free thinking, but still obligated to her cultural norms. So while I don't fully understand, I have some exposure. \n\nYou seem like a supportive brother.", "The groom acknowledges that the wedding is for multiple days. If he knew there would be an issue, it was HIS job to communicate that to his guests at the time of approving the +1. The shitty thing to do is to let them show up and then fucking drop the bomb that the BF would not have access to a bed. His sister even offered to go back home and miss the festivities, and he insulted her. You may not move in with the groom, but if your family was having a big event that everyone else was staying with one person for, and you and your partner were invited, would you not also assume that you'd be put up in the same house? Why is she wrong for assuming that her bf would also have a bed??? \n\nI'm not even saying they need to sleep together or anything like that. Neither is she. Just that the guest he invited deserves a bed. And his excuse for not giving him one is shitty.", "And he invited her and gave her a plus one.

I feel like it\u2019s obvious bf was also staying with OP and if that wasnt ok (which is perfectly reasonable) then OP should have made that clear so that sister and bf could find alternative accommodation or bf could decide not to come or both could decide not to come.\n\nWhy would sister be staying with OP if bf was paying for a hotel room elsewhere? Sister would stay with bf in that case, so it makes no sense.", "I\u2019m sure she knows her family and their traditions.

Based on his other comments about cultural expectations, I'm assuming fiancee still has her own residence separate from his.", "There literally isn't a free bed unless he kicks someone out of a bed he already promised to someone else. Why should boyfriend have more consideration than the people actually taking part in the wedding.", "Nope. She should have been mature enough to understand the chaos he was going through just before his wedding and called him to ask him what the sleeping arrangements were.  Think he is dealing with quite enough.", "Plus one to the wedding. Not the beds in his house.", "It is up to a guest to fit in. Not to impose their lifestyle or values on their host.", "He says in a comment he didn\u2019t clarify (if someone doesn\u2019t explicitly invite someone to stay then they\u2019re not invited) in any event she is aware of their culture so if sleeping arrangements are such a big deal; why not ask explicitly? \n\nHe is busy planning his wedding so she should have specified her needs instead of assuming. Why should he sleep on a couch or deal with unnecessary tension because older relatives are unhappy with sister and boyfriend sleeping together. Sister is aware of their cultural dynamic so if it was such a big deal then she should have asked. Imagine sleeping in someone\u2019s house because you can\u2019t afford a hotel then expecting them to sleep on a couch or start family drama the week of their wedding. \n\n\nIs it that hard to let your sibling enjoy their wedding and minimise drama\u2026really all sister has done is give her relatives a valid reason not to invite her boyfriend to event because they don\u2019t want fights.", "Again, that's stuff he needed to tell her BEFORE they arrived. All of this is understandable, but so is her assumption that at least her partner would be treated with dignity when he's invited by her family. To repeat, I'm not saying he has to take away from someone else \"more important to him\" but I am saying he's TA for not having told her that's how it would be prior to their arrival. And he should definitely not have called her childish for wanting to leave after she found out about the arrangements.", "It\u2019s a 4-5 day wedding! Of course he\u2019s going to stay with his gf! If OP wasn\u2019t ok with that he should have told sister so they could both make alternative arrangements before they showed up and discovered the issue too late!", "He says a lot of stuff in his comments including that he does not really approve of her lifestyle and that she can do better than him.\n\nThe \"did not clarify\" part was said regarding wedding functions, as it's a multiple day wedding.\nAnd as you said, they should be aware of their culture. She was to take part in every wedding function but her BF only for one unspecified part?\n\nAnd we still don't know anything that they talked about before. Or if she did tell OP what she expected/needed.\nAnd she did not expect for them to sleep together but that they are accommodated similarly as her suggestion regarding taking turns on the couch implies. She never said she needs to sleep in the same room with him only that he shouldn't be the only one sleeping on the couch (amongst all strangers).\n\nImagine being invited to a wedding +1 being told that you can sleep at the grooms house (as culture indicates) but your +1 was supposed to get a hotel/motel and was actually expected to not come at all(as OP also said in the comments).\n\nThe last section of your comment can easily be turned the other way. And if he did not specify he thinks she is the \"black sheep\" of the family and that he does not approve of them I would maybe think the same way. But this screams \"set up\" drama on OPs part.", "She has no responsibility to ASK about sleeping arrangements? He was not invited and her assumptions were ridiculous and disrespectful, not understandable at all. Why would the groom assume that he has to house a guest? The sister knew better and wants to make her point that she will not follow their customs at her brother's wedding. She can do that shit at her own wedding and deal with the fallout herself.", "Nope she had the obligation to check with him first. She is well aware of \u201ctheir\u201d mutual culture", "I have never assumed that my +1 was invited to all the family specific pre-wedding events without asking, especially a +1 that the couple getting married has never met.", "Like I said in my reply to your example, if everyone was being housed at the same place and you, why would you not assume that it extended to you unless told otherwise? She's not trying to not follow customs wtf she wanted her bf to have a bed, not to have a bed exclusively with her. How hard would it have been, at the time of okaying the +1, for the groom to say \"hey, I know I said that our living arrangements would be so and so, but now that your want another person there may not be enough room at our house for him to have a bed, do you think you guys could make other living arrangements\"?? \n\nHow is she supposed to know that the house is this tightly packed without his communicating that to her? I see it more like her brother enjoys this power play, and I hope when it's his sisters turn she goes out of her way to fuck around with bro and his wife. And clearly, anything will be acceptable if she says \"oops sorry! I was too busy to give a fuck about my guests\" because thats acceptable to you.", "And he\u2019s well aware that this culture clash was obviously going to happen when she showed up and had already decided that bf was sleeping on the sofa with no discussion.\n\nShe isn\u2019t even saying they need to sleep together, she asked if bf could stay in the shared boys room with OP!", "That\u2019s true.\n\nMaybe ESH then. This was a completely foreseeable issue and no-one thought to address it until it became an actual issue.", "That\u2019s very true, but not all the events in a 4-5 day Indian wedding are just for close family, there\u2019s a few that are for all guests, which you would assume you are invited to if invited to the ceremony.", "EVERYONE is not being housed there, just a few select people. There are two couples and three singles who have taken up all of the available beds. I would never assume I can stay somewhere without asking first."]}
