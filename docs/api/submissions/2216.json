Don't be shocked this is just how things are done in my culture. (My fiance has also moved back with her parents until all this is over).  \n\nI have absolutely no problem with here bringing her bf around and I think neither do my parents. But my aunt and uncle certainly do. I've even heard them whispering that what effect this might have on the younger cousins when they heard he was coming. \n\nI tried to placate everyone and distract them with my wedding plans and it worked. However when my sister got here things got a little more complicated. Sister came home to a warm welcome and it wasn't that awkward with aunt and uncle and her bf either. \n\nBut when she saw the sleeping arrangements her face fell. I was bunking with another male cousin. My parents and aunt and uncle got a room each and there was another bedroom for her to share with 2 female cousins. She got annoyed and asked what her bf was supposed to do. I told her we can set up the couch for him.\n\nThis irritated her and she said she'd sleep on the couch out with him. I flat out refused as what would our parents and aunt and uncle think.\n\nShe then said she didn't like that he'd be on the couch and that she'd get a comfy bed even if she's sharing. I told her this was out of the question and that she's behaving like a brat.\n\nThen she suggested the cousin I was bunking with and her bf take turns on the couch (in our culture the wedding can last for a few days). I refused this as well because well my cousin brother is my buddy and I don't want to share space with her bf who is practically a stranger.\n\nSis started getting angry at this point and yelling at me asking why the hell did I say she was allowed to bring someone then. I told her she could bring someone for the wedding and not to my house.\n\nShe got even angry at this and told me I know Indian weddings last for 4-5 days and where was he to go during the wedding functions as they can't afford a hotel for those many days.\n\nI told her this wasn't my problem and that she's forgotten our culture. There's no way my parents would accept her sleeping on the couch with her bf. \n\nShe flipped me off and told me if she doesn't get to stay with her bf or if my cousin doesn't alternate, she'll leave. I told her i would be a waste of travel expenses and time and to stop behaving like a brat.\n\nBf at this point butt in and said he's perfectly happy on the couch.

You offered them somewhere to stay for free if the accommodations are not to her liking she can leave.", "NTA\n\nThis would have caused a lot of drama at your wedding. Yeah, we may or may not disagree with some stuff in our cultures, but someone else\u2019s celebration is not the time to take a stand.\n\nYou can\u2019t sleep with a random dude next to you. She has a bed and BF has a couch and it\u2019s free. If they cared so much about sleeping arrangements in a wedding house they should have checked in with you beforehand.", "YTA for at least not considering letting your cousin and the bf switch couch and bed every other night", "NTA.  I was anticipating going the other direction from the title.  But your issue is the very high number of house guests consistent with a cultural expectation.  You\u2019ve been forced to pack the house.  A bedroom for the male cousins, a bedroom for the female cousins, bedrooms for the older generation, and a separate space for the boyfriend.  If your cousin wanted to stay at your place, she should have inquired of sleeping arrangements.  If she was dissatisfied with them, she could go elsewhere.", "YTA. You knew the wedding will last for days, so of course he'd need a comfortable space to sleep. And she didn't invite a random date - she invited her partner, which you also knew about. You're honestly too locked up in people's judgements to give your sister any consideration, but since she's right in her demands you're writing her off as a brat.\n\nYou could have handled this in 20 other ways. But you chose the typical desi guy route - dismiss the person causing you issues on something as minor as alternate sleeping arrangements. Isn't our culture also big on hospitality? Would make sense to remember that. Make the poor guy feel welcome, groom-zilla.", "NTA.   You are providing a free place for them to stay.   If they don\u2019t like the sleeping arrangements you\u2019re providing, they need to pay for a hotel.

I'd say NAH only because I know what indian weddings are like since I'm indian too but at the same time I'm more progressive and not very traditional.\n\n It's not a huge deal for people to sleep on the floor when you're all living together so sleeping on the couch isn't anything special. \n\nAt the same time your sister probably feels like you're purposely excluding her BF since everyone gets a bed except for him. And while he isn't family he is still a guest and it's not polite to treat a guest like an outsider, especially when they're someone close to your sister", "I\u2019ll probably get flack over this but I\u2019m going to go with NTA- every culture is different and they\u2019re not married. If they want to sleep together they should get a hotel or an air bnb. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re not going to spend time together during the day. It\u2019s only for a few days.

Your sister should as well having been raised that way. Instead of it being more of what your parents and aunt and uncle think, it\u2019s more of a respect thing for the older generation.

How pathetic", "NTA.  You are trying to avoid offending so many people.   Expecting sister AH to observe social constricts adhered to by other relatives is completely reasonable.   IMO sister and bf would best be required to stay somewhere other than the family residence.  Sister is clearly the AH here.", "NTA your house and wedding, your rules.  And if you wish to make those rules based on respect for your elders and your culture, that's your right.", "NTA.  You are being reasonable and have offered a compromise. There is only so much space in the house.  Since you say packing the house is common in your culture, then she should've known that she would need to be flexible about sleeping arrangements.  Where you went wrong is that you should have given your sister a heads up about the fact that she would not be sleeping with her bf -- unlike past times when she slept with her boyfriend in your house.

YTA\" judgements here all over the place because it they apply their culture \"rules and norma\" to this situation.\n\nBut your \"+1 does not apply to staying with us\" and him being the only one not having a bed kinda makes you the AH.\nYou squeeze you sister in with 2 other cousins but can't make room for him?\nWhy are you not taking the couch yourself as the host which in my opinion would be the best way to do it.\n\nShe's just upset that you treat him as a second class guest and not that they just can't sleep together. YTA\n\nI'd hope they remember this if they ever marry and put you on the couch while your wife has a bed", "YTA. Oh my goodness. They're adults, & quite honestly, its time for you to pull up your big boy panties & not care what other people think. Other peoples opinions don't pay bills.

She's not even saying she wants to fuck him all night, she even asked why he couldn't be in YOUR SHARED ROOM. the original commenter said your sister is sneaky, but really it's you. You're the one who wants to pretend to be accepting and liberal, you're now hiding behind your aunts and uncles and culture to treat someone you invited into your home like shit. If you were so busy you couldn't ask 2 follow up questions when she asked if she could bring a plus 1, then then you should've told her up front then and there. Now, you get to continue to be liberal and force her bf to sleep on the couch, while her bf has to be humiliated because if you don't think your aunts and uncles will have something to say about him for even sleeping on the couch, then you're lying to me and to yourself. \n\nAnd before you say one word about culture and expectations, let me say I am Indian. If I or my family cared enough to influence my decisions, I would have communicated that WHILE ASKED ABOUT THE +1. You don't get a pass for being \"too busy\", this is your event and these are your guests. Then why even have an event? Just do whatever you want by yourself. I think you're quite weird and wanton for how desperate you are for the approval of small minded people. And quite pathetic for the lack of hospitality you have displayed. Hope your wedding and appeasing your shitty relatives was worth it to you.\n\nEdit: I see you say in your comments that she should not be \"stoking the fire\" - what you don't understand is that the fire will be stoked no matter what. She's just enjoying her life with her bf and this is apparently gossip fodder - and as someone who comes from a conservative society, I know firsthand how annoying it is to have every single thing you do be used against you just because it's different from everyone else's expectations. And I almost bought your liberal act, until you started using words like \"wanton\" and \"stoking a fire\" for...wanting her bf to have a bed and posting some pictures? If you go to great lengths to accommodate someone's sensitivities, then you probably agree with them. I'm sure the LGBTQ+ community is looked down upon in your society; if you came here and asked the same question but with a gf instead of a bf, everyone here would be telling you that your efforts to do so would mean you are probably homophobic too.

At the end of the day that's not on her, and I say this because culturally, its on the host. Also, a sister trumps aunts and uncles. At my wedding I had my immediate family stay with me, and all other relatives were provided appropriate space, ie mattresses/cots, etc. Desi weddings mean the house being full to the seam with relatives. It's on you to find proper places for those relatives. I think what irks me most and pushed you to an AH is the way you talk about your sister.

Her growing up in that culture she should have known this was a potential issue and should have asked about the sleeping arrangement beforehand. Different cultures and religions have different rules. You may not agree with it but there are people that won't agree with your culture. As long as someone isn't getting abused people should try to keep an open mind and accept other people's/culture/religion differences. If everyone did that we would have less wars.", "Here\u2019s where the different cultures come in.  They obviously are traditional Indian.  She knows that and doesn\u2019t care.  I don\u2019t know where they are but if they are in the US I\u2019m guessing she\u2019s Americanized.  Don\u2019t know what that\u2019s called in UK or Australia if that\u2019s where they are.  She can just suck it up for the 4 or 5 days. NTA", "Exactly", "So it\u2019s ok for you and your fianc\u00e9 to live together before marriage, because you\u2019ve stated she\u2019s moved back to her parents til after the wedding. What are you f silt saying about her? Is she weird and wanton? Are they allowed to disrespect your fianc\u00e9 for sleeping with you before marriage? Or are you just a hypocrite who think it\u2019s fine for you, but not your sister?\nIf your fianc\u00e9 isn\u2019t a woman of loose morals, how is your sister, and why aren\u2019t you standing up for her?", "I didn\u2019t finish, but you stated that your fianc\u00e9 moved BACK in with her parents while the preparation for the wedding is going on, which implies that she was living with you before everyone descended on you.  It\u2019s ok for you to live with someone, but your sister cannot sleep in the same room as her boyfriend?  YTA", "YTA", "NTA nothing wrong with sleeping in the couch. They can skip having sex for a week lmao.", ">She then said she didn't like that he'd be on the couch and that she'd get a comfy bed even if she's sharing. I told her this was out of the question and that she's behaving like a brat.\n\nYTA\n\nWas reserving judgement until this.\n\nSo you literally invited +1 but have them on the couch when everyone is setup in their rooms? Then you stop an adult from also hanging out in the couch? \n\nInsane.", "YTA couples share beds, not everyone adheres to old school cultural expectations", "NTA. I have been to several Indian weddings myself, and had to introduce my boyfriend as my fiance to avoid the judgemental eyes from uncle and aunts in the family. We even had to wear rings to prove to them, because they kept on asking us questions. Indian families can throw a huge fit in cases like this, and the fact that it is a wedding, it is best to stay away from stuff like this which can later leave a sour taste. To be honest, I don't agree with these values and believes, but I would not want to force my modern values on someone either that makes them uncomfortable. \n\nInfact, in most weddings like this, even married couples sleep separately as women are involved in singing and dancing throughout the night with the bride and men might have their own plans, which is also a pretty standard practice. So it is not like she is being treated as a special case. I am surprised how is she not aware of all these though?\n\nIn this situation, it is best she rents out a room if she is not comfortable sleeping away. But definitely I don't see any harm in being accommodating for a few days.", "Indian here and hijacking top comment to say YTA for the misleading way in which this is set up. Your sister isn't demanding a separate room for her and bf. She's annoyed that her boyfriend is the only male guest expected to sleep on the couch, which makes her feel he isn't welcome. This is valid. You not wanting to share a bed with a guy you're not close to is some American bs. In India, people of the same gender share a bed comfortably, if the bed is too small then a mattress is brought into a bedroom, and yes as your sister suggested, different people alter between taking the mattress. No one who is a guest is ever made to sleep on the couch outside alone. That's just as taboo as your sister and her boyfriend crashing together. You don't like the boyfriend, but won't say so, aren't open to solutions, and are misrepresenting your sister's concerns just to get validation from an internet platform where no one knows anything about our cultures and is buying your bs.", "I knew it was an Indian wedding in the third paragraph.\nNTA\nYour sister should have known not to bring her boyfriend in the house. Those aunties will eat them alive!", "My guess is he's presenting his sister in the worst possible light to elicit a thread full of negs to rub her face into. Or to vicariously humiliate her by displaying the ruder bits to anyone whom he supposes is in agreement with him. \n\nThen again I suspect that sort of thing as a motive every time an absolute ass posts. And as you've cunningly deduced, we have a humongous specimen to contemplate right here.", "But OP and his girlfriend lived together. Just because something has always been done doesn\u2019t mean we have to continue to do it, especially if doing so makes you a hypocrite.", "In India, the fact that the daughter has a boyfriend and is allowed to live with said boyfriend is already extremely liberal of her family. In front of the other family and guests, however, they need to follow cultural norms. If they don't family loses face/honor. The parents will be gossiped about for being bad/failed parents, the daughter will be gossiped about for being loose/immoral. The wedding itself might be impacted if OP's inlaws take offense to gossip.\n\nJust like you don't wear white or make an engagement announcement during a western Christian wedding there are norms and traditions followed in India. The sister is creating unnecessary headaches and drama.", "Things are different in India", "Your aunt and uncle are fuckwits and you're an arsehole for siding with them.", "YTA\n\nHow would you have wanted your fianc\u00e9 to be treated by your sister if she was the one getting married first. Invite your fianc\u00e9 to be your plus one and then put her on the couch?\n\nYour sister isn\u2019t mad at you for not getting to fuck under your roof, it\u2019s about her feeling you don\u2019t respect her partner/relationship. Clearly family is a huge part of the culture which is why you\u2019re providing accommodation for aunts and uncles and cousins; normally when people approve or support their relationships, partners are treated like family.\n\nThis is someone who could be her life partner, aka your future family member, why do you have the attitude that he\u2019s just some tag along and that you\u2019re doing her a special favor or being surprised he\u2019d stay with family for the wedding? \n\nAlso\u2014audacity to cuddle in front of family? One, you don\u2019t know they\u2019d act in \u201cinappropriate\u201d manner. Two, have you and your fianc\u00e9e not been living together during at least your engagement? It sounds like you and/or family just don\u2019t approve or like him and are giving her a public showing of it.", "NTA", "culture and everything aside, I would not want them to bang on my couch anyways\nNTA", "NTA makes sense tbh culture or no cukture", "I think you\u2019re manipulating the headline to make it seem like sister wants to sleep with boyfriend at your house. What she wanted was for you to treat him like a guest and offer him a better accommodation than a couch since he would be the only one sleeping on a couch.  And when she asked if she could bring someone, she thought you\u2019d be a proper host.  But since you only would offer the couch, she wanted to sleep on couch in solidarity with him.  She wanted her bf and cousin to alternate using beds so that bf doesn\u2019t feel singled out like he\u2019s unwelcome.  I\u2019d be ok with the couch, personally. I think this is a matter of difference of expectations. NAH", "NTA, it\u2019s completely disrespectful for her to want to sleep with her boyfriend while her parents are in the same house. I\u2019m not Indian but my culture doesn\u2019t like that behavior either.", "Your sister is right. You knew she was bringing her bf. You knew how long the wedding events last. The least you could do is offer a decent accommodation for her bf instead of treating him rudely, pretty much ostracizing him and making him sleep on the couch. I'm with your sis on this one. YTA", "No Indian Wedding without THE DRAMA \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nI am also indian BTW.", "Thank you! I thought I was going nuts that I was the only one who noticed that! It\u2019s ok for him to have a premarital relationship, but not her. He says she went to her parents for the wedding as if that means his family somehow doesn\u2019t realize that they\u2019ve been living together for years. And big whoop. Most couples do that in most cultures. I lived with my husband for a year before our wedding and he went to his mom\u2019s for the days leading up to it. OP, YTA, and a sexist one regardless of culture.", "Wow, not surprised at all. I could smell it from his language in the op. Glad someone confirmed.", "But it\u2019s ok for OP to live with his fianc\u00e9e? Yeah, that\u2019s hypocrisy. For OP to not be a hypocrite, the he needs to allow his sister the same freedom he and his fianc\u00e9e have. It\u2019s great to have cultural values, but ones that belong in the 19th Century have no place in the 21st."]}
