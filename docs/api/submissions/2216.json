Don't be shocked this is just how things are done in my culture. (My fiance has also moved back with her parents until all this is over).  \n\nI have absolutely no problem with here bringing her bf around and I think neither do my parents. But my aunt and uncle certainly do. I've even heard them whispering that what effect this might have on the younger cousins when they heard he was coming. \n\nI tried to placate everyone and distract them with my wedding plans and it worked. However when my sister got here things got a little more complicated. Sister came home to a warm welcome and it wasn't that awkward with aunt and uncle and her bf either. \n\nBut when she saw the sleeping arrangements her face fell. I was bunking with another male cousin. My parents and aunt and uncle got a room each and there was another bedroom for her to share with 2 female cousins. She got annoyed and asked what her bf was supposed to do. I told her we can set up the couch for him.\n\nThis irritated her and she said she'd sleep on the couch out with him. I flat out refused as what would our parents and aunt and uncle think.\n\nShe then said she didn't like that he'd be on the couch and that she'd get a comfy bed even if she's sharing. I told her this was out of the question and that she's behaving like a brat.\n\nThen she suggested the cousin I was bunking with and her bf take turns on the couch (in our culture the wedding can last for a few days). I refused this as well because well my cousin brother is my buddy and I don't want to share space with her bf who is practically a stranger.\n\nSis started getting angry at this point and yelling at me asking why the hell did I say she was allowed to bring someone then. I told her she could bring someone for the wedding and not to my house.\n\nShe got even angry at this and told me I know Indian weddings last for 4-5 days and where was he to go during the wedding functions as they can't afford a hotel for those many days.\n\nI told her this wasn't my problem and that she's forgotten our culture. There's no way my parents would accept her sleeping on the couch with her bf. \n\nShe flipped me off and told me if she doesn't get to stay with her bf or if my cousin doesn't alternate, she'll leave. I told her i would be a waste of travel expenses and time and to stop behaving like a brat.\n\nBf at this point butt in and said he's perfectly happy on the couch.

You offered them somewhere to stay for free if the accommodations are not to her liking she can leave.", "NTA\n\nThis would have caused a lot of drama at your wedding. Yeah, we may or may not disagree with some stuff in our cultures, but someone else\u2019s celebration is not the time to take a stand.\n\nYou can\u2019t sleep with a random dude next to you. She has a bed and BF has a couch and it\u2019s free. If they cared so much about sleeping arrangements in a wedding house they should have checked in with you beforehand.", "YTA for at least not considering letting your cousin and the bf switch couch and bed every other night", "NTA.  I was anticipating going the other direction from the title.  But your issue is the very high number of house guests consistent with a cultural expectation.  You\u2019ve been forced to pack the house.  A bedroom for the male cousins, a bedroom for the female cousins, bedrooms for the older generation, and a separate space for the boyfriend.  If your cousin wanted to stay at your place, she should have inquired of sleeping arrangements.  If she was dissatisfied with them, she could go elsewhere.", "YTA. You knew the wedding will last for days, so of course he'd need a comfortable space to sleep. And she didn't invite a random date - she invited her partner, which you also knew about. You're honestly too locked up in people's judgements to give your sister any consideration, but since she's right in her demands you're writing her off as a brat.\n\nYou could have handled this in 20 other ways. But you chose the typical desi guy route - dismiss the person causing you issues on something as minor as alternate sleeping arrangements. Isn't our culture also big on hospitality? Would make sense to remember that. Make the poor guy feel welcome, groom-zilla.", "NTA.   You are providing a free place for them to stay.   If they don\u2019t like the sleeping arrangements you\u2019re providing, they need to pay for a hotel.

I'd say NAH only because I know what indian weddings are like since I'm indian too but at the same time I'm more progressive and not very traditional.\n\n It's not a huge deal for people to sleep on the floor when you're all living together so sleeping on the couch isn't anything special. \n\nAt the same time your sister probably feels like you're purposely excluding her BF since everyone gets a bed except for him. And while he isn't family he is still a guest and it's not polite to treat a guest like an outsider, especially when they're someone close to your sister", "I\u2019ll probably get flack over this but I\u2019m going to go with NTA- every culture is different and they\u2019re not married. If they want to sleep together they should get a hotel or an air bnb. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re not going to spend time together during the day. It\u2019s only for a few days.

Your sister should as well having been raised that way. Instead of it being more of what your parents and aunt and uncle think, it\u2019s more of a respect thing for the older generation.

How pathetic", "NTA.  You are trying to avoid offending so many people.   Expecting sister AH to observe social constricts adhered to by other relatives is completely reasonable.   IMO sister and bf would best be required to stay somewhere other than the family residence.  Sister is clearly the AH here.", "NTA your house and wedding, your rules.  And if you wish to make those rules based on respect for your elders and your culture, that's your right.", "NTA.  You are being reasonable and have offered a compromise. There is only so much space in the house.  Since you say packing the house is common in your culture, then she should've known that she would need to be flexible about sleeping arrangements.  Where you went wrong is that you should have given your sister a heads up about the fact that she would not be sleeping with her bf -- unlike past times when she slept with her boyfriend in your house.

YTA\" judgements here all over the place because it they apply their culture \"rules and norma\" to this situation.\n\nBut your \"+1 does not apply to staying with us\" and him being the only one not having a bed kinda makes you the AH.\nYou squeeze you sister in with 2 other cousins but can't make room for him?\nWhy are you not taking the couch yourself as the host which in my opinion would be the best way to do it.\n\nShe's just upset that you treat him as a second class guest and not that they just can't sleep together. YTA\n\nI'd hope they remember this if they ever marry and put you on the couch while your wife has a bed", "YTA. Oh my goodness. They're adults, & quite honestly, its time for you to pull up your big boy panties & not care what other people think. Other peoples opinions don't pay bills.

Your house, your rules.

Her because she should have checked the arrangements before she left and should defer to the preferences of her host or stay home.

She's not even saying she wants to fuck him all night, she even asked why he couldn't be in YOUR SHARED ROOM. the original commenter said your sister is sneaky, but really it's you. You're the one who wants to pretend to be accepting and liberal, you're now hiding behind your aunts and uncles and culture to treat someone you invited into your home like shit. If you were so busy you couldn't ask 2 follow up questions when she asked if she could bring a plus 1, then then you should've told her up front then and there. Now, you get to continue to be liberal and force her bf to sleep on the couch, while her bf has to be humiliated because if you don't think your aunts and uncles will have something to say about him for even sleeping on the couch, then you're lying to me and to yourself. \n\nAnd before you say one word about culture and expectations, let me say I am Indian. If I or my family cared enough to influence my decisions, I would have communicated that WHILE ASKED ABOUT THE +1. You don't get a pass for being \"too busy\", this is your event and these are your guests. Then why even have an event? Just do whatever you want by yourself. I think you're quite weird and wanton for how desperate you are for the approval of small minded people. And quite pathetic for the lack of hospitality you have displayed. Hope your wedding and appeasing your shitty relatives was worth it to you.\n\nEdit: I see you say in your comments that she should not be \"stoking the fire\" - what you don't understand is that the fire will be stoked no matter what. She's just enjoying her life with her bf and this is apparently gossip fodder - and as someone who comes from a conservative society, I know firsthand how annoying it is to have every single thing you do be used against you just because it's different from everyone else's expectations. And I almost bought your liberal act, until you started using words like \"wanton\" and \"stoking a fire\" for...wanting her bf to have a bed and posting some pictures? If you go to great lengths to accommodate someone's sensitivities, then you probably agree with them. I'm sure the LGBTQ+ community is looked down upon in your society; if you came here and asked the same question but with a gf instead of a bf, everyone here would be telling you that your efforts to do so would mean you are probably homophobic too.

You now have to choose if you carry on that misogyny for another generation or if you put a stop to it. Your aunties and uncles probably disagreed too but complied to avoid rocking the boat. Now they're old and set in their ways. How you act now is likely to influence how you raise your own daughters if you ever have any. \n\nStand up for your sister (and your future wife, who sounds like she normally lives with you) and find a sleeping arrangement that works for her and makes her feel welcome. Let the aunties die mad about it.", "YTA.\n\nSofas are uncomfortable, and can cause problems to the spine buy a darn airbed. It's pretty AH behaviour to say she can bring him to the wedding, not give her a heads up about the sleeping arrangements AND THEN expect him to sleep on the sofa for 4 - 5 days.\n\nA decent airbed is approx \u00a320. You could make an effort to actually welcome her bf into the family. And you most definitely should have told her the arrangements before arriving.", "YTA\n\nPut the cultural stuff aside for a second. In what world is putting your sister's boyfriend on the couch something a good host would do? Whoever sleeps on the couch has to go to bed after the latest night owl, and get up before the earliest morning bird. They and their things are at the center of everything. They get the least sleep and the least privacy out of anyone in the house, and you've assigned that role to the one person who doesn't have the comfort of being part of the family. This dude is going to be *miserable*. You should have either given your sister and her boyfriend their own room, or told them ahead of time that space was tight and you couldn't fit them.", "YTA for forcing your sister and her boyfriend (two adults) into an understandably uncomfortable and isolating sleeping arrangement because of your ignorant relatives. \n\n\"What would my aunt and uncle think about...\" \"There is no way my parents would accept...\" \n\nThis is YOUR house. It sounds like your relatives, throughout your life, browbeat you into thinking that this creepy, controlling behavior is acceptable. \n\nDon't bring culture into this, culture and religion are not valid excuses for any mistreatment. \n\nIf someone wants to treat YOUR YOUNGER SISTER poorly because she shared a bed with her partner overnight, maybe be a good brother and tell them to quit it or leave? Or does the idea of doing that scare you too much?", "I\u2019m saying YTA, I don\u2019t really care about culture or if other people aren\u2019t comfortable with what someone else is doing.

It\u2019s your house and you don\u2019t have to be beholden someone else\u2019s values.

It's your house, they are staying there for free, you get to decide the sleeping arrangements.\n\nAlso, her solution of having her boyfriend and cousin \"take turns\" sleeping on the couch is so weird!  First of all, why would you want to share a bed with a stranger on the nights when your cousin had the couch?  And second, wouldn't that require you changing the sheets on two different beds (yours and the couch), every night?", "You could have handled this a bit better by discussing sleeping arrangements ahead of time with her, but NTA. Sometimes it's worth making small sacrifices to avoid drama or tension. It's your house, it's your wedding, and you're absolutely not out of line for expecting them to sleep separately for a few nights for the sake of keeping peace. It would have been considerate to inform her of the house rules before she got there though.", "YTA", "Okay, being Indian myself (born in North America) I was going to say NTA, because I understand the culture.\n\nBut, you\u2019re actually vile.

I get that it\u2019s your house and you\u2019re allowed to make your own rules. But those rules should have been made known well before she came over, especially if she can\u2019t afford a hotel.

Hopefully everything goes smooth and congratulations!", "I think this is just a different set of expectations based on cultural norms. Neither is wrong both of you failed to communicate expectations.

She is not entitled to free lodging at someone's house.", "You don\u2019t sound like you have an awareness of the desk culture. families opinion is the number one thing. The sister is in the same culture and knows her family is traditional so she would have known there is no way in hell she can sleep in the same room as her bf with her relatives in the house. Home girl thought she would turn up and OP would have no choice but to agree.

I'd hate to have such gossipy and controlling relatives.", "Funny that you talk about imposing standards when this adult woman and her partner are forced into an uncomfortable sleeping arrangement due to the small-minded gossip of ignorant relatives and her cowardly older brother.", "Yea, that dog should be grateful that he's not on the floor! /s", "It's also pretty standard for the younger generation to take the smaller beds/ places with less privacy.

He also stated that he knew she was bringing him and \u201cforgot\u201d to clarify the situation.

I'm indian too so I get it. Aunties and uncles are always opinionated and gossip about everything. It's always some sort of competition on whose child is the best, whose is the fuck up of the family etc. \n\nBut why do you care? Ignore them all.

It'd make a lot of others uncomfortable since the guests are mostly divided by gender and OP didn't plan for this guy to be there.

Aunts and uncles will care and gossip. Sisters will be labeled loose/immoral and the parents will be labeled as bad parents.

But it's also ok to decide that the short-term comfort of your out-of-town sister is not worth the drama just before your wedding.", "Not just sexism and oppression but sexism and oppression against your own sister. How can someone call themselves a \"liberal brother\" and refuse to support their sister for having a love life", "You feel like it's obvious because you are American. To people raised in a culture like Indian, it is obvious that a boyfriend cannot stay with the family. Not married = not family. The sister is ridiculous.", "I wouldn't exactly say weird, as an American woman. If my kid was an adult, as long as I don't have to hear/see anything, I'm okay with them having intimate relationships, even while living with me. Just be discrete about it. We're all humans, sex is a normal part of life. However, if under 18, my child will not only need to disclose who they have intimate relationships with to me and let me know how old they are (solely for safety reasons), but they will also not be allowed to have sleepovers with someone that they're in an intimate relationship with in my home. I'd just be way too concerned about their mental health / development. Sorry, future 16-year-old kids, if we end up arguing about it at some point. \n\nThose would be my \"rules,\" I guess. It's just not a part of life that I feel I should have much of a say in, other than for safety reasons. I could see some of my relatives being a bit sexist about these types of things here and there (one cousin in particlular), but this is a very extreme reaction to me.\n\nIf either of my two siblings called my kid \"loose\" or any other backwards, fucked up shit that could easily mess them up mentally before the age of 25, I'd promptly kick them out of my house if they were there and not speak to them again unless they gave us a sincere apology and show changed behavior. And if they can't do that, then they ruined the relationship, not me. Fuck that. Life is way too short for that shit.", "I am not American. But I am also not Indian, so your point still stands.", "Downvote me for this if you like, but the bf wasn\u2019t invited - he\u2019s a plus one. The sister invited him, not OP or the family.", "Why should he have to deal with his sister\u2019s drama on top of getting married AND having his older relatives staying with him. It is enough of a chore having that many relatives staying in his home for 5 days."]}
