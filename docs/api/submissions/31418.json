Just go on vacation and leave me out of that part.*", "NTA. \n\nHe lied. \n\nNow you have a choice. You either officially uninvite them all, OR you communicate to them *in writing* that if she chooses to vacation with them and they choose to attend your wedding celebrations (including the days leading up to), that she is absolutely NOT welcome to participate in ANY of the planned events. And that if she shows her face at any event they will all be excluded immediately.

I would replan the activities and not inform your family and just tell them the activities yiu planed beforehand needed to be canceled and they should enjoy their family vaccation. And have someone at the wedding who checks that only invited guests are present. This way they can do their family vaccation before your wedding and you can enjoy the activities with your inlaws.", "NTA your family sounds immature and like they don't deserve to be in your wedding. Im sorry they are doing this to what is supposed to be one of the happiest days of your life.", "NTA\n\nBut I would disinvite your dad and hire security, grow the spine your father lacks", "NTA\n\nBut do you still want your dad there? He lied to his wife about her daughter being invited and is badmouthing you to the family. Unless you have security, I wouldn't be surprised if he tried sneaking her into the wedding.", "First, obviously you get to invite or not invite anyone you want.  It's apparent that your relationship with this person is over, and you don't have to invite them just because someone married someone else.  Also she is of course entitled to vacation anywhere she pleases.\n\nAre you requiring everyone to do activities together for three entire days?  That seems a lot to me.  And if your dad or someone else chooses to go and spend time with step instead?  Would you see that as a betrayal, or would it be fine with you if people skip your planned activities in order to do other things?\n\nWhat's missing here is information on why your dad feels she should be there and what he said when you confronted him about it.", "NTA- you have two choices- ignore the fact she is there (at the same resort) and enjoy your wedding, or disinvite your dad and his wife. In the long run option one might cause you less grief. \nBut I would let your dad know that you are disappointed with his behaviour, and that he has shown you his true colours. \nGood luck!", "NTA.

I did this when my future in laws became unbearable with wanting to invite their friends and extended family, and directing the activities.", "NTA. He picked his current wife over you. He certainly does not get to add anyone to your guest list, much less someone you do not want there. This is sad. I hope you can forgive him someday for not attending your wedding, because uh-uh. He has earned a disinvitation.", "NTA. What's she going to do during your planned activities?", "NTA.  Uninvite them.  Do you really want liars and manipulators at your wedding?  Time for them to learn consequences,  and you will have a much more peaceful wedding.", "Nta I would send him a messaging saying I told you I\u2019m not comfortable with her coming and it is my wedding and event. If you continue to put her feelings above mine you will no longer have an invitation to my wedding nor my life.", "Is it too late to change the destination for your wedding?", "NTA. She's not been a person in your life in any positive way for years, and there's no reason to invite someone you don't wish to invite. In contrast, it is a destination wedding, and if every other member of their family is going, it's reasonable for her to want to be at the destination too. Unfortunately, the *only* portion of that you have any say in, or control over, is whether or not she's at the actual wedding or reception.\n\nWhile it's obviously going to turn into a \"She's already here, so why can't she come in\" situation, being in that same area isn't really preventable unless you're willing to uninvite them all and hire some security to make sure they don't try to crash the wedding. In truth, your father has been perfectly content to stay silent over a month over this, so I see no reason not to inform him the invitations for him and your stepmother are no longer valid.", "NTA... Its YOUR wedding! you choose who you want to be there to share the special day with you.", "NTA.  Personally I would uninvite your father and step mother for going totally against your wishes for your wedding.  It is obvious they don\u2019t respect you.", "I know it's a hard decision...I went NC with my dad almost 3 years ago...but I think you may be at that point if he's refusing to communicate. I would try one more time maybe try to meet him somewhere for lunch or something and if you don't get anywhere with him disinvite him. It's hard but sometimes it's the only decision.", "NTA. Before cutting contact with everyone, maybe dig and find out who told who that your step sister is coming. Then send out notifications to those you want to unite that the wedding has been postponed. Send other invitations to those still coming.", "It\u2019s supposed to be the happiest day of your life. You don\u2019t want her there. Tell your dad that side of family is uninvited. Or cancel the wedding and reschedule without any of them.", "NTA, if your wedding is at some place like a Sandals resort, you could probably have it moved to a different hotel, same franchise \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40 I'm just saying", "Change the destination", "This is a complicated one! Of course you're allowed to not invite your step sister to your wedding, and make sure she's excluded from all wedding related activities (your wedding, your choice on who you'd like to attend and who not, regardless of reasons). And your dad is wrong to have told people she's invited when you've made it clear she's not. He's totally exploiting a loophole with the \"family vacation\" bit, and yeah it'll be awkward as hell knowing she's nearby and you could bump into her at any point, but the \"vacation\" is technically separate from your wedding (I know, loopholes...) and as such you can't really ban her from that... \n\nCan't blame you for not wanting her there, but I don't know what you can do about it other than changing your destination (if that's still possible for you and your guests) and not inviting step sister, dad, and anyone else involved in essentially trying to smuggle/force her into your wedding... Or elope...\n\nNTA for not wanting to invite a specific person to your wedding, but ywbta if you tried to ban her from the location given that it's not your own property / land.", "Tbh I\u2019d disinvite them all and see if I can have my wedding somewhere else. The whole area would be ruined for me.", "!updateme", "NTA - don't let her attend", "NTA. Tell your dad you are going to have a great wedding without any drama.

Weddings bring out the crazy in everyone. I would just cancel the destination wedding and elope or only have things with the finances side of the family. Your family has proven they will hijack your day for someone who has actively sought to ruin your life on multiple occasions. Even if she doesn't do anything, she just knows being there will distress you, and I personally wouldn't want to give her the satisfaction.

I don\u2019t think this is complicated unless dad is paying for everything but even still\u2026 also at no point did stepsis try talking to you about it. This isn\u2019t a family vacation, this is your wedding. You should let your dad know how it makes you feel knowing your contact history and without providing an ultimatum, let him know it feels like a deep disrespect and disregard of boundaries on something as important as your wedding day.", "NTA- solve every problem by hiring security for your wedding and the other events, and let dad, step mom, and step sister know that you have *absolutely no problem* with them being removed by force. If they want to embarrass themselves it's their prerogative, but you will not be making any exceptions or accept any excuse.", "NTA. He went behind your back and lied to you. If she goes on her \"vacation\" at the same place your destination wedding takes place and time, they'll pressure you into letting her attend at least some of the activities you have planned.", "Def NTA. If the venue you are using has other destinations in their portfolio, explain the situation and see if they would be willing to change it to one of their other properties.", "NTA you can't stop her from coming to a public place, but you've made it clear she is not to be part of any of your wedding activities.  Expect family members to be jerks about it, but do your best to ignore them and enjoy your wedding.", "NTA: Wait until she books it then change it.", "Your not the asshole for not inviting your stepsister to your wedding and related festivities but you can not prevent people from travelling to the location you are getting married. It may be source of annoyance but your stepsister is free to travel and wherever she likes by herself or with other people.", ">He also led my stepmom to believe my step sister was still invited and I had to break the news when they were looking up accommodations one night at dinner.\n\nSorry wtf. Why didn't you tell them yourself, as soon as you decided.", "Oh he is definitely bringing the step sister to your wedding. The only way to avoid that is un-invite Dad and stepmom. Since he has not spoken to you for a **month** I think it will come if no surprise when you email him and stepmom email him the reverse invitation. \n\nGood luck and Happy Wedding.", "NTA. My dad invited his brother (who I\u2019d only met twice) and SIL to my TINY, INTIMATE wedding and I ended up letting it slide. I hated having them there, it was weird and awkward and I\u2019m still mad about it. Part of me wishes I had told my father that if he wanted to be on vacation with his brother, then he should do that instead of coming to my wedding\u2026 But that marriage didn\u2019t work out anyways, and when I got married again we eloped and it was great.  It will absolutely disturb your event if she shows up. Even if you try to ignore her, she\u2019ll probably still be a distraction and stressor. Boundaries are important.

The activities, if they\u2019re held at places and times available to the public, can be crashed if there is anyone in the family willing to leak the information.  \n\nDad has the potential to really ruin this completely if he wants to.", "Nobody is being chosen over anyone.  Dad is coming to the wedding.  Must he choose them every day?  Why?\n\nIf someone came to my wedding and then went and did something else with someone else I don't like I LITERALLY WOULD NOT CARE.  I do not own their time or their affection.  I have no idea why this is upsetting.  \"Oh no, my dad has a relationship with someone I don't like?  (pearl clutch) Whatever shall I do?\"", "If they choose to go to a wedding somewhere does that mean they are required to spend three entire days doing things the bride planned?  Why or why not?  And does the bride have any say or any emotional stake in what they do when they're not around her?  Why or why not?", "Since you misunderstood what I said I will rephrase. He chose to make his wife and step daughter happy over respecting his bio daughters wishes about her wedding by lying to the step daughter and saying she\u2019s invited when she isn\u2019t. She can\u2019t tell him who to spend time with but it\u2019s within her right to say she isn\u2019t invited to the wedding. She still can be at the destination she just can\u2019t be part of the wedding festivities or plans.", "Yep. What a gut punch for dear ol dad!", "Why are you giving this person advice they didn't ask you for in the first place? Tell them if they are an asshole or not and why you think that and move on.", "Well, many daughters have very strong relationships with their fathers (and many do not, for good reasons).\n\nYou say \u201csomeone\u201d like it\u2019s anyone. For all we know it could be the most important person in her life after her partner and it would be unfathomable not to have him at the wedding. \n\nThe opposite is also a possibility but in your world it seems to be the ONLY possibility", "I don\u2019t know - I\u2019m not OP - but my read is that OP has not even *considered* uninviting her dad. Like it would never cross her mind.", "In your example he is choosing to spend time with stepsister who wasn't invited instead of participating in the wedding activities he was invited to. He is literally choosing to spend time with his stepdaughter instead of with his daughter in an organized event. 362 days to spend with step daughter, why does it have to be during wedding activities?", "It\u2019s not about \u201cspending the entire three days\u201d with the bride. It\u2019s about inviting someone who has been horrible to the bride to the destination during her wedding festivities. It\u2019s clearly a betrayal. Stop being obtuse.", "So you think that three days of activities are required, even though OP said no.  The wedding is what they are going for.  Three days of activities are optional.  According to OP.", "Personally I'd ignore it.  I'd say let whoever do whatever, I'm getting married.  Seems like even paying attention to it is a waste of energy.", "Explain to me why it's a betrayal.  Explain why the bride even cares where the step is.  If she's not coming to the wedding why is she concerned about her location?", "Congrats on your apathy. OP does care & has made it clear to her dad she does\u2014she set perfectly easy boundaries to follow that he ignored", "Using someone else\u2019s destination wedding to have a family vacation with someone who has been horrible to the bride, who the bride has made clear is not invited, at the same time is very much a betrayal. The chances of step sister & bride crossing paths? High. The chances of step sister crashing events? Also high. The chances of step sister creating drama and monopolizing her dad\u2019s time during the wedding festivities? Also high. You seem willfully obtuse here.", "What someone else does with their time is not up to her.  It's a boundary she doesn't own.  If she thinks it's up to her she's the one in the wrong.", "All that needs to be done to avoid drama is simply to ignore this.  If she wants drama the best way to give her what she wants is to be upset about this.  The best way to foil her is to ignore it.", "Omfg. He invited his stepdaughter to be at the same place as his daughter\u2019s wedding. You\u2019re ridiculous & I\u2019m done wasting my time with you.", "Lmao this is just naive nonsense"]}
