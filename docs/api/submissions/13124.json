This was a relationship that lasted 17 years and 13 years of marriage. We got married young and grew apart. We have three children. All were three adopted because my Ex has fertility issues and we wanted to help children in need. The divorce is amicable and we are splitting assets and child care 50/50. We have both been seeing other people, and I have had my girlfriend for a substantial amount of time\n\nMy current girlfriend (soon to be fiance once the divorce is done) is now pregnant; in the first trimester. I was trying to hold off announcing until the second trimester, but my youngest child eight-year-old figured out the secret. So, I told my three kids that my girlfriend was pregnant and had a talk about it and what that meant for our family. I did not tell my ex as i knew it would hurt her feelings. I did publicly announce through social media on Monday so that my kids had time to process it. \n\nOn Wednesday, my ex found out, again from my youngest child, and had an emotional breakdown. She freaked out because I did not message her privately before I announced it. She dropped off our children at my house and flew to visit her family on the other side of the country. She is refusing to talk to me now because I should have notified her before telling everyone. We do follow each other on all social media, but both of us check it infrequently.\n\nSo people of Reddit am I the Asshole for not telling my ex-wife that my current girlfriend is pregnant before my friends and family?\n\nI accept your judgment.\n\nEdit 1 - ok so im seeing a couple people calling out my vagueness on the time line. Yes I was intentionally vague because I didn't want people being like well studies say... So let me add this. I was separated for 6 months before I started dating. Yes my girlfriend was first person I dated after divorce. We have worked for the same company for a few years, but at different sites. We only met online meetings and never in person. We met in person in July after I was already separated. I was still fighting to reconcile and she had a boyfriend. We started chatting and just went together. There was absolutely no cheating involved in this story.\n\nEdit 2 - seeing quite a few people asking why I didn't tell her. I have moderate anxiety disorder (according to my psych) and confrontation is something I struggle with. My ex can come on a little strong, and last week  I was ejectected from my volunteer position at church until my divorce is finished. So when I announced I was hoping she would see... I didn't really think about how she would feel.

This is not the way to successfully coparent. You are starting down a bad path of putting your kids in awkward situations bc you\u2019re a coward.

I\u2019m cringing just thinking about it.", "Yes, YTA. \n\nYou knew this would hurt your ex, and you must have known your kids would mention it.

And you never gave her a quiet call at a time where she could process this news", "Soft YTA, it\u2019s totally fair for you to want to wait until the second trimester to share the news, but as soon as you told your kids, a courtesy call to your ex would have been best, given you\u2019re in good terms and this is a big change in your life that might impact co-parenting. \n\nYou\u2019ve also spent years with this person you once loved, and you know getting pregnant was not an option for her. It\u2019s a lot for her to take in, I can\u2019t help but have empathy for her.", "YTA regardless of her infertility issues I think you owe the mother of your children a heads up before you announce publicly. She should have time to have conversations with the children and avoid being blindsided of she hears it from someone else.", "YTA\n\nIn no universe do I believe that after a struggle with infertility you are so obtuse to not realize how devastating your ex-wife would find it to hear from your 8-year-old that daddy's new GF is pregnant. \n\nOf course you should have messaged her privately to let her know. Letting your 8 year old do the dirty work was callous and exceptionally cruel.", "YTA because you are separated and not divorced yet so this is embarrassing for her, between that and the fact that she had fertility issues, you should have been more considerate of her with a heads up.  I\u2019m also suspicious of you because your equated this one fact to \u201ctelling her all of your life details\u201d which is hyperbole and also that you have been with your girlfriend for a significant amount of time in your words, long enough for her to get pregnant and be in the second trimester but only separated for a year\u2026.", "Yeah, YTA.

You went through infertility.  You should know that. \n\nHaving her get blindsided by her kids is unkind. Be kind to your coparent.", "YTA. This is the mother of your kids? Beyond the fertility issues and the fact that you\u2019re literally not even divorced yet (and have been separated not that long but already with a long-time girlfriend), this is not effective co-parenting.", "NTA. You don't owe her personal details of your life. The only things you owe are things relevant to your kids.", "NTA,\n\nNot her issue and she\u2019s getting too comfortable expecting this level of honesty and transparency. You guys can co-parent without knowing everything about each other.", "You got an excuse for everything. Just take accountability that this was an AH move. \n\nShe had to find out from your youngest child that daddy\u2019s new gf is pregnant! This is someone you\u2019ve been with for 17 years & you couldn\u2019t give her a personal heads up. YTA", "NTA I disagree with many of the responses.   \n\n\nThe kids figured out the pregnancy, which has not  even passed the 'safe' stage.  There are two people involved here. I get what people are saying about co-parenting, but the ex is not entitled to know about the GF's private medical information.  \n\n\nI'm projecting here: my late husband eventually had a civil relationship with his adulterous ex, mainly for the sake of their adult children. However, she was - to say the least - intrusive. (Found out where we  were going on honeymoon and booked herself and her affair partner into the same resort, for example.)  \n\n\nAfter my experiences, I don't blame anyone for being guarded around their ex.", "YTA. No matter how amicable the divorce was up to this point, not telling your wife that you are having a child with someone else was massively rude. Or cowardly. Or both. Yeah, both. \n\nBecause she's not your ex-wife. The divorce isn't final. She's your wife and she deserved to be told as soon as you knew you could not keep it a secret.", "Big time YTA. Your title is misleading. Getting your new girlfriend pregnant when you have been separated for less than a year and share three kids, and then telling the kids and announcing it on social media without a courtesy call is callous.", "I think after 17 years together, 13 years of marriage and 3 children, ex wife is family. You will be connected forever through the kids so in that sense, she is family. It would have been better to tell her in private before announcing to the whole world. \n\n> I did not tell my ex as i knew it would hurt her feelings.\n\nSo better to let her find out through the youngest child or social media? Very shitty. And did you expect the youngest child not to mention this? That alone would be reason to tell her before kid spills the beans.\n\nYTA\n\nEdit: and a child, brother or sister of your adopted children, is not merely a \"detail\" in your life. That's downplaying it a lot.", "NAH. You\u2019re obviously not *obligated* to tell her. But your marriage and divorce were amicable and you could have given her a heads up\u2014-especially since fertility is likely a sad issue for her. Did you expect your kids to tell her?", "I mean\u2026 YTA. Fertility issues aside (which just add a whole new layer of complexity), you should have told her. Even if you feel like it has nothing to do with your ex, you have kids together. So she should have been told directly so you can navigate your kids\u2019 feelings about this change to their lives. It is normal for kids to have concerns about how adding a baby will change their lives. (Not every kid will, but it\u2019s not unusual.) It is a life change for your kids also. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a bad thing, but it is a life change. To coparent it\u2019s best to keep each other informed.", "YTA.\n\nYou've been together 17 years. She had fertility issues. You knew this would hurt her. If the kid is old enough to figure out a pregnancy, he's old enough to talk about it to people, especially a parent. You should have known this would happen. Why not give her a heads up? If you're ready to share with the world, you could have let her know privately so that she had time to process it in the absence of the kids. \n\nSometimes the shock of hearing news from the wrong channel, or being blindsided or backstabbed with it hurts more than the news itself. Have some empathy, otherwise co-parenting will be hard in the future.", "I had a similar situation happen. People will assume you cheated. Regardless, my now boyfriend and I started dating a month after he filed for divorce. He was emotionally and mentally checked out for 15 years and was just waiting for his youngest to turn 18. What my boyfriend did was classy AF. We kept our relationship private for a year in a half. He waited for his wife to move on and continued to help with house he gave her with all the equity. She re-married a year after they divorced. He kept in communication with her, even when he didn\u2019t necessarily want to, he was considerate of not doing anything to show how quickly he moved on. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH, but it would\u2019ve been considerate to give her a private heads up so she could process it first. It\u2019s probably somewhat humiliating for her. IDK, only you really know the answer to that question. Congratulations on the baby!", "nta. none of her business what you do in your private life since you are separated and waiting for divorce papers. your personal telationship is over and both of you have moved on. end of story.", "Soft YTA \n\nYou\u2019re not a monster, but telling her would\u2019ve been the kind thing to do. Especially since she has fertility issues. \n\nPlease remember that you will have her in your life for some capacity for a very long time, because you share three kids and their care.", "NTA\n\nYou could certainly have been kind and given her a heads-up, but you didn\u2019t owe her one and aren\u2019t the asshole for not doing so.", "NAH", "NTA.

You didn't have any obligations to tell your ex, but it would have been a nice thing to do so she could process it before it was made public. Again - it really isn't your responsibility, but after almost 20 years together, you knew this would be hurtful for her - you should have told her privately.", "NTA- you aren\u2019t married anymore and she has no right to matters unrelated to the care of your shared children.", "NTA, there's a reason why the term ex is used. It means used to be and no longer. You have no obligation to notify your ex-wife about anything except in regards to the children you share. Otherwise, your personal business is yours to share as you please.", "Sorry I probably will will get downvoted but NTA she is your ex, her emotional wall being is not more important than your family. They are the closest to you and you are entitled to share with them first\u2026she is your ex\u2026while you can be civil to eachother your personal life is no longer any of her business. This is a very personal issue and does not include her. This is coming from someone who has had an ex, was a single mother and has remarried.

The ONLY thing that matters is the children and their well being, I did not need to know when he impregnated his girlfriend nor did I have to run my engagement and marriage by him\u2026you are not responsible for her feelings, SHE is responsible for her feelings and YOU are entitled to your privacy.", "This is one of those situations that yea, she's your ex HOWEVER you're still technically married.\n\nIf legally separated (and recognized by your state), Soft YTA due to complexities of the situation and she is seeing this as a slap to her face.\n\nIf legal separation is not recognized by your state, Major YTA as this is now confirmed adultery.", "NTA", "INFO: how does this compare to the way that you handled other touchy subjects in the past? Did you have any agreements with each other about how big things like this would be handled?

She doesn\u2019t get prior authorization.", "I'm sorry to hear that you're going through a tough time with your ex-wife. It sounds like you're doing your best to handle the situation in a mature and respectful way, which is great to see. It's understandable that your ex-wife may be feeling emotional right now, given the circumstances, but it's important to remember that you can't control how she reacts. From what you've shared, it doesn't sound like you did anything wrong by announcing the pregnancy publicly once you'd spoken to your children. It's tough when things are still raw and emotions are high, but hopefully with time your ex-wife will be able to see that you had good intentions and didn't mean to hurt her. Keep doing your best to communicate openly and honestly, and hopefully things will work out in the end. Wishing you all the best.", "NTA But you may be insensitive based on your current relationship with your ex. It doesn\u2019t sound like you are close so you owe her nothing. If you wanted to know all about each other\u2019s lives then you shouldn\u2019t have gotten divorced. But if you are still friends (not just friendly) with your ex then you may have been insensitive. You tell the people in your life before making a public announcement. If she\u2019s not really one of the people in your life then she gets told with the rest of us.", "Sorry but YTA. It probably made her feel awful to hear that news from your kid. I feel like you owe her an apology.", "YTA \u2014 not because you owe your ex the information, but because it\u2019s shitty to expect the kids to either keep secrets for you or deal with the emotional results of telling her. If it\u2019s going to upset her, you should do what you can to manage that upset rather than using your kids to protect yourself from it.", "YTA. Not even just for hurting your ex, but for putting your children in the position of accidentally delivering that news. You were afraid to do it. So you had your kids do it? You can say that you didn\u2019t know they would but anyone with two brain cells to rub together could see that coming. You just let it happen to save yourself discomfort.", "No, the fuck does your ex need to know. She should leave u guys alone.", "NTA - you all are LEGALLY separated and headed towards divorce. You owe her nothing but to be a father to the children you all share. Nothing else. With this reaction I can see why things fell apart.

Like maybe a heads up would have been nice for her, but that\u2019s not your job or responsibility anymore. It\u2019s shitty because I\u2019m sure that\u2019s a horrible feeling for her but it\u2019s not your fault.

You don't owe her your every life detail, after all, you two are in the process of  divorcing. However, since the divorce is amicable and you two are going to coparent the kids you adopted together, it would have been a nice thing to do. You didn't want to hurt her feelings, but your approach backfired, and she was hurt anyway.

This is such a failure on your part.", "Unpopular opinion, but I think NTA. I\u2019ve been the ex-wife in the situation; my ex and I hadn\u2019t even filed for divorce yet and were separated (granted still talking/figuring things out for parenting) for about 2 months when him and his AP/now wife got pregnant. However, I fully do not think he owed telling me he was pregnant (and he didn\u2019t). About a year later, they got pregnant again with their second child, and again I never thought he owed telling me this information. It didn\u2019t change anything with parenting; if my son asked questions or talked about siblings or his step mothers pregnancy, I just either answered the questions or encouraged his excitement to be a big brother. \n\nMy point is that we were/are not in a relationship any longer; and in the same way that I don\u2019t divulge my personal relationships/life events to him, I didn\u2019t expect that from him. It didn\u2019t change anything with custody or my son besides a couple curious questions. When the relationship ends, so does telling personal details/having a confidante. And I\u2019m sure he wouldn\u2019t expect me to tell him if I become pregnant. \n\nThe only reason I could see this going into asshole territory is if he had been leading on the ex-wife. I know it probably sucked hearing about the pregnancy because of her fertility issues, but that\u2019s kind of just life and they aren\u2019t together anymore. I wasn\u2019t thrilled when I heard about the 2 pregnancies with my ex because we had been together for 10 years, but it wasn\u2019t my place to get upset at him when our relationship had ended.", "NTA", "I will go against the grain and say NTA for the part where you chose not to privately tell your ex. It\u2019s your life, she is an ex for a reason and has no business getting upset. Sounds like a bitter ex who is jealous for not being able to give birth. However I\u2019m a little leaning towards towards YTA for the fact that there is a little mismatch in timelines. You say you\u2019re dating your current GF for a substantial period now which I\u2019m sure how long after the separation it started.", "My husband met me very shortly after his separation (even shorter than than you met your gf) and we are six years in and incredibly happy together.  Anyone telling you it's too soon isn't worth listening to. People starting over in mid life know who they are and what they want much more clearly than people who married at 20 and think any happy relationship that follows a breakup is a mirage. :) \n\nAs for not telling her, she probably was always going to be upset by the news, but that means your delivery had nothing to do with it.  The fact that she's mad you didn't have a private, one on one moment with her is more about losing her status as your priority than it is about the baby.  If she would have taken the news fine if you'd told her, then this isn't about the baby. If she's sad about the baby but the drama is about you not having a private special moment about it with her then it's also not about the baby.  You are not together anymore - her emotional demands on you need to cease. Your guilt needs to cease as well.", "NTA what you do is your business now and not hers anymore, the only thing you need to share with your ex now are details about the kids you share with her!!!!!", "YTA-no way you didn\u2019t know that this would be deeply upsetting.  You were together for almost 20 years and you knocked up someone else less than a year after being apart?  I\u2019m devastated for your ex.   You needed to let her know so she could process alone-instead you let her get blind sided.", "You\u2019re a massive A and a coward.", "YTA\n\nAfter going through the process of fertility troubles and then the adoption process (3x) you should be more than aware of the emotional impact this would have had, instead you opted to do something hurtful because it was easier for you emotionally. \n\nYou have no obligation the consider her feeling, but you 100% have a obligation to your children who are now living with their mother who has had a emotional breakdown. That's where you have messed up massively. You only moved out a year ago, then you move in with another woman, then your having a baby and you even mentioned marriage - is a engagement so quickly wise, you have given the children no time to process all this drastic change. I have whiplash from your relationship story and I don't even know you. \n\nUnless you manage to repair the damage to the co-parenting relationship quickly,  your children may start to resent the baby.  Your kids will see that you had a good co-parenting relationship until your gf got pregnant, now you don't.

No, he wasn't supposed to ask for her blessing, but he was supposed to tell her information that will affect her children's lives.
