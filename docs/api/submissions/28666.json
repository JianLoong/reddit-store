We got married April 2022. We have two vehicles. A truck that is in his name only and my SUV that is in both of our names. He works out of town Monday through Thursday and has a work truck provided so his truck is only used on the weekends when he's home to drive it.\n\nIn October 2021 the transmission in my car went out and I needed a vehicle to drive for the week that it was in the shop. We live together so I expected that he would be okay with me driving his truck for the week. When I asked, he said no, stating I wasn't on his insurance policy and offered to pay for a rental car for me to drive. It was a nice suggestion but my boss offered to let me use their extra vehicle and not spend the money, so I took them up on that offer. My car got fixed and life moved on.\n\nFast forward a couple of months and his sister was in an accident. He drove his truck and hour and a half to her and let her borrow it for the 2 weeks while her car was being repaired. When I asked him about this, he said there were both on the same insurance plan with their parents still. I made my feelings known but didn't argue it.\n\nWe got married April of last year and are on the same insurance policy now.\n\nLast month, his moms car broke down and she needed a vehicle to drive for a couple weeks while they got it checked out and decided whether it was worth fixing etc. This time, he did come to me beforehand and let me know that he was going to let his mom borrow his truck for a couple weeks. I stated I have no problem with him loaning his truck out. My problem was that he was against letting me drive it for the week my car was down.\n\nWe got the truck back last week from his mom and all seemed fine. Until last night. He was in the yard cutting up branches to take to the Boy Scouts camp site for firewood. He cut the branches up on the interior yard first and as he started on the branches on the exterior part of the yard, I went outside and chucked the logs over the fence in a pile to help him load them up. After I had them over the fence, I went inside and got the truck key and backed the truck out of the driveway and pulled it around the yard to where the log pile was.\n\nGuys, he saw me driving the truck and put his chainsaw down and met me in the road while I was backing up asking what I was doing. Confused I said I was backing up to help him load the logs up and asked what the problem was. He looked at me and said, \u201cyou know my feelings about it.\u201d When I asked him what his issue is with me driving the truck when he has no problem loaning it to his sister/mom for weeks at a time to drive he said (in regards to his mom) \u201cbecause of all the stuff she does for us.\u201d I told him I understand that she does a lot but thats not a good enough answer. I want to know why he'll loan his truck out to them but has a problem with me, his wife, driving it. All he said was that he wasn't going to fight about it. \nMy driving record is good.

If I asked him - and I have - he will say he's a good driver because he's never been in an accident. As the passenger in the car I can tell you that's because the other drivers when he's done something stupid have been good and saved the day.

Make sure he's not on your insurance and you keep both keys.\n\nI'm not usually tit for tat, but him not wanting you to move the truck in the yard is  BS, along with him stating that his mom 'does so much for you' \n\nHmmmm... Maybe stop doing so much at home if it doesn't get you driving privileges.\n\nBut seriously, get your own car.", "You have bigger issues than the truck", "NTA I really think you need marriage counseling.

Spouses are allowed to have their own things, even if they share them with others, but I would find it pretty upsetting all the same especially if we had a joint SUV.\n\nFrankly you could get your own car that is not shared with him for any reason (take him off the SUV), and let that be that.", "You married a jerk.

Honestly it's such a weird thing that I would have called him on it and demanded answers when it happened before marrying because it's weird. If he's just like I love my truck no one can drive it I'd still call him an idiot but a consistent one. But his behaviour singles you out as basically having less rights within the relationship. He could have just as easily put on you insurance back when you needed to use it, it's one phone call and a hell of a lot cheaper than renting a car for a week.\n\nHis outright refusal to admit the problem or talk about it because he knows it will be an argument because he knows he's doing something that is wrong but wants to do it anyway.", "Buy yourself a better truck and don\u2019t let him us it.

It\u2019s kind of ass backwards and I never thought it might be taken badly so I have so something for me to work on.", "Perhaps the issue is that he\u2019s actually not comfortable with ANYONE else driving his truck.  However, he may feel he can\u2019t say no to his mother, whereas he can get away with saying no to you.\n\nIt could also be that he doesn\u2019t think highly of your driving skills, but doesn\u2019t want to say it directly.  It just becomes obvious when you ask to drive a vehicle he values."]}
