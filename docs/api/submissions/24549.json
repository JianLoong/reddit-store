Specifically his mother and sister. I am typically not a confrontational person, but I have finally had it. Since the beginning, I have been nothing but kind and respectful. For some back story, his parents are divorced. His mother and his sister have seemed to never like me, but his father is awesome. His father has said how much he likes me because I make his son happy. I come from a happy, loving family of parents who are together, so I have never had to deal with this before. To make a long story short- recently I have found how much his sister talks sh*t on me and my family behind my back, as well as his mother.  They aren\u2019t they kind of family that shows love. Mine is, and I don\u2019t know if they attack us because they can\u2019t find anything wrong with our family. I was informed tonight, that they have made a rumor that I have a \u201cweird\u201d relationship with my father and family. They even went so far as to accuse my father of doing something to me when I was a kid- and may I say, he has never laid a single hand on me in my life. My father is the best father that anyone could ask for, and I count myself lucky that he is my dad. That was the final straw. I can handle when they only attack me, but when they attack my family, and make up rumors about them that aren\u2019t true- what am I supposed to do? Sit back and take it? No. I have had enough. I have typed up a LONG note in my phone to send to my boyfriends mother and sister tomorrow-its quite long and a little brutal and down to earth- but I have to know, am I the asshole if I send this message?\n\nEdit:\nMore info- we just moved states so it\u2019s hard to sit down with his family and talk in person. The text I want to say is very mature, and for the most part just explaining as to why I am upset, and that they need to accept me and respect me and our relationship. My boyfriend is defending me, but we are both people pleasers and peacemakers so it\u2019s quite hard for us to talk to them like adults without being talked over. I\u2019ll be talking to my parents and then boyfriend before I send anything, but I\u2019ll make an update if anything changes.", "created_utc": 1691927005, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15pwqr3/wibta_for_putting_my_bfs_family_in_their_place/", "score": 56, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But I wouldn\u2019t send your message, I would speak to them in person, relatively calmly to not seem hysterical and give your bf any reason to rail against you, because it sounds as though you\u2019re 100% justified and if you remain calm and don\u2019t do anything stupid there would be no reason for him to not support you.

They are NEVER going to like you or respect you. Could they be less of a life suck?  Maybe, if they cared and they\u2019ve shown you for years that they don\u2019t. I\u2019d go with the layer letter mentioned above. Your father has nothing to do with them and they are fabricating a very dangerous factoid about him. The narrative does not need to be true to ruin one\u2019s life.", "OP they do not need to accept you. A text outlying that they do would not get you what you want.

They already know all the things you typed. They know they're making things up, they know they are being disrespectful. All you need to communicate to them are the consequences. Please don't send paragraphs to people who won't care about the contents.", "Nta", "NTA, but I don't think you'll get anything you want from any of those approaches. People don't change; if they're rude, snide and conniving now, they always will be. I have learned the hard way that when I married, I married his whole family. I had similar problems with MIL (she died) and still have issues with SIL - who I mostly just ignore.", "Dont think you are TA here but I would get your boyfriend to step up, text will probably be used against you, as for suggesting your dad touched you up, thats fucked up.", "Never put this in writing. Anything you write can be used against you.", "It\u2019s not really as much of a \u201cmean\u201d text, more so of calling them out on what they have done. It\u2019s more so to bring to their attention that they have hurt me and their son and don\u2019t seem to care. It\u2019s a lot of explaining my side of how I feel, my morals, and how I\u2019d like their respect. No harsh words or hate is being thrown at them, because I\u2019d like to still have them like me after this- but they also don\u2019t function like normal people. they are the kind of people who always dish it but the second they receive anything back they immediately turn into a victim.", "Agree this is a bf issue. He should be shutting that sh!t down.", "Yes thank you. He and I have been discussing that for a while and I think he may also be at his breaking point. I assume your in laws are also very manipulative and power hungry, so you can understand how hard it can be for us to even bring this up with them.", "Agreed! Also, if you text it, that conversation is there forever and they can show your message to anyone that they want. It will be tough, but have the conversation in person and make sure you are calm before you speak to them. \n\nI know you are hurt and angry, but conversing under those circumstances end up making things worse. Calmly let them know you heard about the rumors and don\u2019t appreciate what they are doing. Ask them what made them decide to make up such a lie in the first place.", "This!  It\u2019s so much better than the text you\u2019re thinking of sending.", "He does defend me and my family, no problem there. However we moved states and we can\u2019t sit down with his family in person. He is currently on vacation with them and I\u2019m not there. He called me tonight drunk and told me everything, which I deeply respect. So it\u2019s a sticky situation.", "While I agree there are better ways for OP to handle this than using a text I honestly can't see how you can call her the a-hole for this", "Don't you think the boyfriend should take the lead with his family?\n\nIt's a little concerning he's let it get this far.", "Why isn't your boyfriend taking the lead here?\n\nYou say he called you drunk on vacation with them and told you all this, was his only reaction to the awful things they were saying to tell you?\n\nHe should have immediately shut it down and let them know that if they continue talking about you and your family this way he will need to [insert consequence here.] We're looking for things like leave this vacation, take some time away from the family upon his return, etc. What it sounds like he has been doing is just telling them to quit it. For one, that's under-reacting and 2 it's ineffective, that's why instead of actually quitting they are escalating. And to such ugly things!\n\nIs he actually willing to DO anything?", "Why do you still want them to like you. They don\u2019t like you *now*. After you tell them what\u2019s what and they get butt hurt and turn into a \u201cvictim\u201d, why do you think they will ever like you?\n\nJust be glad they are states away from you. NTA", "Oh absolutely- it wasn't an easy thing for him to do; but in all honesty I'd had enough and was even considering ending the relationship due to the abuse. It was the best thing we ever did. They realised he was serious, that they could actually lose their son over it- and they did change. We have lived with a civil, almost pleasant truce since then. I know it's hard, but do it for your mental health if nothing else.", "OK, well this needs to be handled in person.  If you can't do it in person, then it is up to your boyfriend to do it.  You say he does defend me and my family, no problem there.  For three years?  No dear, that does not make sense.  If he was truly on your side with his family, this shit would have ended years ago.", "He shouldn't have repeated what they said, he should have shut it down and immediately left their vacation. If he supports you and your family, he shouldn't be around people who speak disrespectfully and untruthfully about you.", "I agree but only if that made sense. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t think it does. In my opinion, her boyfriend is just as bad. I think he agrees with his parents.", "This is also the way.", "Thank you- I\u2019ve always been a people pleaser and peacemaker, so this has been very hard and frustrating for me.", "If the boyfriend agrees with his parents and is just as bad, she should end the relationship, not waste more energy on them. Confrontation is just an exercise in futility at that point.", "It\u2019s a lot easier to have a peaceful relationship with somebody if you never have anything to do with them.", "Ok then they should break up.", "This is the way", "NTA.", "You will be TA if you won\u2019t talk it through with your BF first.", "I would tell your boyfriend to handle it. Inform him you won't attend his family gatherings anymore and you expect an apology and for them to publicly retract their rumours. NTA", "They don\u2019t care how you feel. Your upbringing and personal moral code is of no concern to them.  They aren\u2019t inattentive to your feelings, upsetting you is the whole point. They are very much focussed on your feelings, and are deliberately trying to make you feel as awful as possible. Sending a polite text respectfully asking them to be nicer and hoping they like you after you send it is frankly\u2026 well, the best thing I can call it is naive. You\u2019re NTA but trying to reason with unreasonable people will not work.", "Girl, they couldn't care less about how you feel, your morals, or how you'd like their respect. It's not a lack of understanding on their part, they're actively choosing to be like this. NTA but sending this would be an absolute waste of your time.", "Wow, what a keeper.  /s. Calls you drunk.  Did he shut them down?  Did he leave?   No?  Respectfully, your bar is too low if that is worth deep respect", "And when he drunkenly told you the awful things they were saying did he mention what he did to defend you?  Frankly, disclosing this while you are apart, when you have no means of addressing it directly with the instigators and leaving you to worry, alone and unsupported doesn\u2019t strike me as a very respectful thing to do. I mean, he went on vacation with the people who have been trashing you and your family for 3 years. Did he even pause and think, maybe I won\u2019t go?"]}
