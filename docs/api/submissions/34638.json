I get along well with them even though we have different views on certain things but I just don\u2019t bring it up and ignore the comments that they usually make. To clarify, I am a Puerto rican woman and am very proud of my culture. I understand that where I live (rural area), they don\u2019t necessarily know my culture and just assume that I have the same culture as Mexicans. Anyway, my gf asked me to bring pasteles to the dinner since her mom wanted to try it. She knows I spent hours making it by myself and wanted her mom to try something Puerto Rican. I brought 2 pairs of them just in case the family didn\u2019t really like it and cooked it. When I was explaining to her family what it is, they first said that the Malanga (taro root) that I used to make the masa looked weird and that it would give them nightmares. I just told them that it\u2019s a root and many different cultures use it in their food and to not know it until you try it. When the pasteles were done, I unwrapped it in front of them and explained how to eat it and to not it the banana leaf. Immediately, they said it looked disgusting and that they were going to throw up just looking at it. The mom was telling them to stop which I appreciated but I explained to them that this was eaten a lot in Puerto Rico and that it takes a labor of love to make this dish. My gf said that she isn\u2019t fond of it and her family started to say \u201cno wonder, look at it! Who eats that\u201d I tried to not let it get to me but I just felt really bad for bringing it or making it and I didn\u2019t know what else to do other than just say that it\u2019s good and she should at least try it. Some hesitated but ended up trying and liking it but some other family members just didn\u2019t try it at all. I haven\u2019t brought it up to my gf cause I don\u2019t want to if I am just overreacting but I just want to know if I am. I haven\u2019t talked to my family about it yet and I\u2019m not sure if I should.

It sounds like she set you up for failure and, instead of jumping it to head off her disrespectful and ignorant family, had the temerity to say that she doesn't like the dish. That she asked you to make.", "NTA. Those are incredibly rude, obnoxious and disgusting people. Your girlfriend asked you to bring the dish and did nothing to prevent them from disparaging your thoughtful cooking. No decent person would ever be so rude to a guest in their home. They are missing out on an opportunity to sample a different cuisine. I love trying all kinds of unusual (to me) dishes. I don't always like all of them but I appreciate the effort and skill that goes into making them. I would be appalled at anyone reacting the way they did.  Your girlfriend did not pass the good manners or loyalty test.", "NTA. It is basic manners not to insult the food someone has prepared for you, even if you don\u2019t care for it.", "NTA. These people have terrible manners. your girlfriend included- I don\u2019t know why she didn\u2019t shut any of this down. You deserved better. \n\nPasteles aren\u2019t even weird looking. Here I was expecting you to say that they ate them with ketchup or something and it started a fight (this may sound insane but I have a lot of Boricua friends and I\u2019ve heard things). These people sound like they\u2019re motivated solely by xenophobia.", "INFO - did your partner defend you or shut down their parents? If not - you have a bigger problem.  This will not change. Racism and xenophobia that is tolerated is racism and xenophobia that is encouraged.  This is enormously disrespectful behaviour and if your partner was not incandescent with rage and telling their family off - you've learned exactly where they will stand for every future snipe and act of disrespect.", "NTA and they are incredibly rude and ungrateful. I had to google them, and they don't look at all disgusting to me. I'd try them! :)", "NTA. Ignoring the culture aspect, these people are complete assholes. They insulted something you made /for them/ to your face.You spent hours preparing something and they told you it disgusted them before even trying it. That's pure asshole behavior. \n\nThem throwing on \"eww who would even eat that\" after you explained that it's a popular dish in Puerto Rico makes them mega assholes. Just because they didn't straight out say \"this food is nasty, and that makes the people who like it also nasty.\" doesn't mean they didn't mean it that way. \n\nYour GF is an asshole because she literally ASKED you cook, and then didn't speak up when HER family insulted said cooking.", "Who the hell acts like that in front of new, free food?", "NTA.\n\nEveryone (aside from your gf's mom) was being rude with their comments.  And I am including your gf in \"everyone\" because she should have told them to stop along with her mom.", "NTA why did your GF ask you to bring pasteles if she doesn\u2019t like them? Why did your GF ask you to bring something she knew it would take you HOURS to make if she was going to discourage her family from eating it? It sounds like your GF also doesn\u2019t embrace your culture or support your desire to remain connected to it. I would set aside her very rude younger family members for the moment & ask yourself if you want to build a life with someone who seems not to care about the time & energy you spend doing things for her mom/family? She also didn\u2019t seem to mind you being made fun of. Down the road would she be committed to your future kids being immersed in their Puerto Rican heritage or would she make fun of the food you make for them or the holidays you celebrate differently? \n\nYou\u2019re both young & maybe this isn\u2019t a serious relationship. If it\u2019s a casual thing just to enjoy yourselves, stop expending so much effort for her family & feel free not to join them for family gatherings. If you feel this is serious, then you definitely need to talk about these issues. She needs to know your feelings were hurt & that you expect her to support you especially when you\u2019re doing something she asked you to do! \n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like you GFs mom said or did anything negative but maybe that was left out. If so at least you nave a potential MIL who\u2019s invested in getting to know both you & your heritage!", "NtA I believe you just got an excuse to never cook for any of them again.", "Can't fix stupid, and getting offended by it is exhuasting. You sound kind and reasonable, just keep on keepin on.", "NTA. They were being rude. Even if they didn't want to try it, they could have just said \"no thank you\".\n\nI got curious, though, and googled it and it looks like perfectly normal food. Also, a taro root just looks like... A root? Do these people never visit a supermarket or anything?", "Nta - that is incredibly rude and immature of them. I would refuse to eat with them again or prepare food for them again. And have a conversation with your boyfriend about how he didn\u2019t defend you.", "You've done something that takes a lot of effort, for people to be openly offensive about anything that takes time and care they'd have to be AH in my book. However, this has another level to it, you tried to introduce them to your culture and food that has importance to you because of your culture - for them to outright insult your cultural dishes to your face and not at least have the decency to approach them with an open mind and take the opportunity to learn from you when you were willing to put effort to show them makes them even bigger AH. \n\nIt's ok for them to dislike the food, but they should try it before reaching that conclusion. And they should be polite in expressing their dislike and respectful of your culture. You are in no way the AH here.", "YWNBTA. This is so sad, I cannot even imagine how you feel! Hugs to you, continue to be proud of your culture, these were just not the people who would appreciate it. Never cook for them again, they clearly won't appreciate it and it looks like your GF will not come to your defense/aid in a similar situation in the future.", "If it's adults, then by all means be offended. If we are talking about kids, los of kids have issues with food based on it looking or smelling different than what they like or are used to. You might as well be upset that they don't want broccoli.", "Pure racism of them NTA", "NTA. Their are lots of food from many cultural that I refuse to eat because my stomach is a whiney little beotch and can't handle anything spicy.  I would never denigrate food from another cultute.", "NTA\n\nYou can cook for me any time you want and the only things I'll do are say \"Thank you so much!\" and \"What's this dish called and can I have the recipe?\"\n\nYour GF's family is rude AF", "NTA.  They sound like close-minded bigots, honestly.  \n\nI had no idea what pasteles were so I looked them up.  They look very close to tamales (a Mexican dish) but with taro root and banana leaves instead of maize and corn husks.  Now I want to try them.", "NTA.\n\nAnyone making comments like that about someone else's cooking is a rude, crude AH, and should be taught some manners by their parents.", "[deleted]", "NAH. Different people have different tolerances to new experiences, especially if they grew up with limited access to different foods.

You made that for them and it was a labour of love as it would be in almost all cultures I\u2019m aware of.\nMy parents are habitually rude and mean about my BFs but never to their faces and wouldn\u2019t dream of doing this. It\u2019s called manners in in the UK it\u2019s even a strong class signifier, meaning it would reflect badly on them if they reacted like this (obviously it does anyway, but you know what I mean).

It's so weird to me that the gf asked OP to bring something that she herself doesn't even like.
