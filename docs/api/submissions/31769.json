Our boys wear the same size as my husband. \n\nWhen my husband does the laundry and puts away the clothes, he always mistakes my clothes as the girls' clothes (my daughter and her best friend), or he mistakes their clothes as mine. Even though the underwear/shorts/shirts are clearly different styles, like the girls' are more pink/girly style/colors with characters or drawings or prints etc. While mine are plain colors/darker colors. \n\nSometimes he would also mistakes my black cycling shorts as our son's underwear and would give it to him with his pile of clothes. \n\nIt just frustrates me that he does that, we have 3 boys plus him, and they all wear the same size and I know which one is which, even though they all wear white shirts everyday.\n\nI spend a lot of money buying kids clothes, even my daughter's friend. I rarely spend on myself, and when I do, and I can't find it, it's frustrating for me. Like I just bought them 20 clothes and I buy myself two shirts, then I can't find it anymore when he does the laundry. He doesn't understand that feeling. \n\nLast week, I found one my daughter's shorts in my drawer. I didn't say anything. Tonight, we were both folding clothes, and he was about to grab her shorts, fold it and place it in our basket, and I said \"I know you're not about to put that in our basket, it's not mine.\" And at this point, I'm just tired of it, so my voice had an attitude. \n\nIt started an argument. Everytime I tell him he misplaced my clothes or he put one of the kids clothes in my closet/drawer, he always denies it, and I always tell him, I pretty sure I know which ones are my clothes and which ones are the girls. He would never admit it or apologize, just deny deny deny. \n\nTonight, he got really upset, telling me I should just be glad he's helping do laundry, and I said you are not \"helping\", this is everybody's clothes, you are simply just doing laundry, I don't misplace his clothes or the boys' clothes, I expect the same from him. He told me I'm being an AH for \"nagging\" him about this issue. I said I was nice at first addressing it, people has limits, so yes at this point I had an attitude about it. He said I was being an AH and making him feel like he was stupid and that I was condescending. And I said it's because he never took accountability or admitted to it or fixed the issue. I told him before, if you're not sure, just ask. Just like I do when one the boys get new clothes that are not from me, I would ask whose shirt is this and not just give it to someone who I THINK owns it. \n\nAITA for being upset about this issue?\n\nI think I may be the TA for pointing the issue out with an attitude.", "created_utc": 1700975655, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1843ap5/aita_for_starting_an_argument_with_my_husband/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I've had this same argument with my husband,  it's very frustrating to not be able to find your own clothing. And I have 2 teenage boys at home, not girls. He gives them my jeans and my tshirts and gives me theirs. \n\nBut I am going to say it was pretty funny the day he wore my black work shorts to work. I'm 2-3 sizes bigger than him, especially in the butt, but he didn't notice that they were super baggy \ud83e\udd23", "NTA this would be easily solved with writing the initial on the tag with a fabric marker", "NTA.\n\nBut it\u2019s definitely time to come up with a new system that does NOT involve adding work to your plate.\n\nWhat if your husband washes and dries the laundry and the kids do the sorting? Surely they can be trusted to identify and put away their own clothing.", "'Helping do the laundry'.... oh the rage that inspires! NTA", "NTA. My dad was the same once my sister and I got big enough that our clothes were the same size as our mum's. He used to dump a pile on my sister's and my beds for us to put away, so we would usually take the stuff that wasn't ours through to each other. But he used to actually put my mum's stuff away, so we would often lose stuff and end up digging through her drawers to find it. It was infuriating.\n\nNow my husband can't do that with our 3 and 7 year olds because they're vastly different in size, but he always has to look at the size to know what belongs to who. He doesn't just know, like I do. I just get the impression that a lot of men aren't that observant about things like clothes.\n\nI'm not sure you can make him more observant, but maybe you can mitigate. Someone suggested labelling the clothes, which is a great idea. Another option is to do as we did, the clean pile goes in your bedroom and you put it away, so you can fix the mistakes.", "You didn't question his intellect. You complained about his lazy habits. And maybe being thought of as lazy is much worse than being thought \"stupid\" anyway?  Why should you be glad he's doing things wrong?

But, I do expect he knows looking at an item if he's seen me or his child wearing it.\n\nNAH. Just stop arguing instead of figuring out a fix for this.

Esh", "NTA\n\nMy husband does the exact same thing. My kids are 5 and 11. And no one here wears the same size. I'm constantly finding my clothes in my 11 year olds drawers. My 11 year olds in mine and the 5 year olds. The 11 year olds in the 5 year olds and vice versa. He could just look at the tags, but it seems to be a difficult task. I know it is weaponized incompetence. And I won't budge. He can keep doing it incorrectly and I just keep pointing it out every time I find a misplaced piece of clothing. And my kids point it out too. It is the same amount of work to do it properly. And no, I won't be taking over the entire chore by myself. And....look I'll just say it.....He's trying to manipulate you into apologizing for calling him out. I've watched how my own husband makes the mistakes. He Tasmanian Devil's through it and just haphazardly slaps clothes on piles. They do a poor job because they don't want to do it at all and they want their wives to get fed up, 'fire them' and take over the whole operation.", "Depending on the age of your kids, maybe everyone should just do their own laundry? I started doing my own around 12.", "I think, a little ESH. What about you do the girls' laundry, your husband the boys, and alternate who does towels/bedding?\n\nOr have the kids start helping with laundry. I was 13 when I started doing my own laundry.", "YTA. Why would he do that on purpose since he knows you are going to bitch at him about it? Just have him leave the folded girls' and women's clothes in a basket so you can go through them before they are put away. And stop being insufferable. No one wants to live like your husband is being made to live.", "This seems to be the product of a silly view of equality.  I could never wash one article of clothing the rest of my life and my wife could do all of the laundry and we COULD still be equal. Because what you might not  know is that I clean all of the bathrooms and bathe the dogs and change the sheets every week while she does the laundry, and she and I agreed that we were comfortable with that arrangement.. that could also be what equal looks like.  Or it could look like any one of 1000\u2019s of other permutations.  \n\nI think you\u2019re focused on the wrong thing. You\u2019re focused on the fact that your husband doesn\u2019t recognize the differences in some pieces of clothing, rather than the fact that your husband is participating without coercion in a task that you want him to share with you. So you\u2019re already off to a great start.  Granted he responded to your criticism of the details with a harsh response that was likely uttered in haste and defensiveness (which I\u2019m sure you never do when you are feeling defensive) and he needs to work on being more gracious while getting to the root of a problem when he sees that you are frustrated, but I think you really need to focus on process. You already have his buy in that this is a task that should be shared. How can you tweak the process to get the result you\u2019re looking for?  Maybe he folds and puts away the boys clothes and you do the girls?  Maybe you both fold laundry, you sort it into baskets, and he then puts it away? Maybe you do what we do and have the kids do their own laundry and then there is never any question about whose clothes are whose when it is just mine and my wife\u2019s clothes commingled in the laundry?  There are myriad ways to modify the process to get the outcome you\u2019re looking for, unless you\u2019re not really looking for a solution in the first place.", "Can you just... iron little red dots onto yours or something? So he can visually check the tag and see it's yours?", "Hmmm, this is a close call. On one hand, your husband is the A\\*\\* for saying \"you should be glad he's helping with the laundry\". Um, he should definitely help... with that many people in the house, everyone should help. On the other, you may be the A\\*\\* because you let this issue boil up until you vented.   \nLook, you need a better system. Guys aren't gifted in understanding the subtle (not to you but they are to him) differences in clothes. How about assign him the task of rough sorting and folding towels, and put folder laundry in a central location where everyone can come and get what belongs to them?", "Perhaps he could take on more of a different chore and leave you with the laundry?", "Soft YTA. Most people will be envious that you have a husband that help with the laundry. Yes, it may be a little inconvenient to have to go hunting for your clothes, but he's trying. Perhaps you can take the time to check the baskets before they get distributed to be put away to make sure that the clothes are set aside for the right person.", "YTA. Be thankful he is helping. Since he isn't doing the clothes shopping it's harder for him to keep it all straight. If you don't like him making some mistakes, then either you can do all the laundry, or at least be the one who puts it all away. Or, have the kids put their own away.", "YTA  what strange thing to explored at ??? You buy the clothes therefore your more likely to remember it many men ((not all)) don't do fashion a top is a top half the time they don't even see colour. Be grateful you have a partner who helps in the house many couple don't. Yes, Partner, not husband!!! I think there's something underlying herr maybe try open communication with your husband instead of passive aggressive comments and arguments it's a fantastic life.lesson to pass on to the many children you have around you", "ETA, IF he's always going to get shit for what are probably honest mistakes with nobody offering to take their own clothes after they're washed and dried AND he won't take better ownership of correcting the same errors.

He was incredulous but I told him that I do that, his wife does that and the reason why she's pissed at him (he was asking for a book that would save his marriage) is because he doesn't. He just leaves all that to her and it's mentally **exhausting** to remember all that and all the other million things you need to remember when you have kids. Of course his wife is pissed, she's *tired*", "This! Men use this for all things they consider \"women's work\". They only care about details if it pleases them.

But when there's school, they got so many activities/sports that their weekdays and weekends are filled up with activities, clubs and homework. Like last year, one of my boys was doing JROTC, cross, and tennis. The other one was doing basketball and taekwondo, the other one is doing archery and JROTC, and a part time job. I'd ask them to do other chores like vacuuming, dishes or helping me prep for dinner, and feeding/bathing/walking dogs, but we decided that me and my husband would be in charge of laundry during school year to ensure that they have clothes for all their activities/sports/practices, I understand some would say \"it'd teach them responsibility if they forgot to do their laundry and have no clothes to wear\", but all my kids are pretty responsible so we're not worried about them forgetting their laundry, but mostly just them being overwhelmed with school and home.\n\nI think the only thing that frustrates me the most is his lack of care about the issue because it doesn't affect him and his unwillingness to do anything about it because it's not a problem to him and also his unwillingness to take accountability, he just denies that he does it and gets mad at me for making him feel \"stupid\" even though all I do most of the time is point out that it's not mine.", "Are you saying children would be better at identifying whose clothes are whose than a grown adult?", "Agreed. In summer time when there's no school, kids do their own laundry. But during the school year, my husband and I agreed that we're in charge of everyone's laundry. Mostly because the kids do a lot of school activities/clubs and on top of that they do sports. Like last yr, one of the boys was doing JROTC, cross and tennis. The other one was doing JROTC, archery and a part time job. The other one is basketball and taekwondo. They're responsible kids and I know they can do their own laundry even during the school year if need be, but we don't want them to be too overwhelmed with school and home, especially with all the activities they're doing. We let them keep track of their own activities/schedule though since it was their choice to join them and we're glad they're keeping themselves busy with stuff like that. We wanna make sure they have clothes for their school/activities/practices. We make them do other chores that won't affect their school stuff if left forgotten, like dishes, dogs, vacuuming, helping prep dinner and cleaning the bathroom. \n\nMy frustration was mostly about my husband not taking accountability, or admitting to the issue and instead denying that he does them, or his unwillingness to do anything about it just because it doesn't affect him.", "Oh no!

Please don't make him do *normal adult and parent duties!* GOD I bet he's SO HUMILIATED to be FORCED to be a goddamn ADULT!", "I think what frustrates me the most is his unwillingness to learn from the mistake or admit to the mistakes or take accountability, he just denies that he does it or he gets mad at me when I mention it. This is something we've talked about so many times. The thing is if I'm the one who makes a mistake, he expects I don't repeat the same mistake again, and if I do, I won't hear the end of it. But this issue, he doesn't see it as a problem because it's not a problem for him. He doesn't apologize, nor does he offer solutions, I've offered a solution like I told him one time, if he's unsure, ask me, just like how I ask them, if I'm unsure about the boys clothes when I'm the one doing the laundry. I don't just assume. To me, it shows his lack of care because it doesn't affect him. I might be wrong for my tone tonight, but I've mentioned this problem in many nice ways.", "Why should she feel grateful that he's contributing the bare minimum to their shared task of ensuring that everyone has clean clothes to wear? You might divide tasks differently, but this is how they do it and she gets to be pissed off if he's shirking.", "That would take hours. If the husband needs some kind of visual indicator, *he* can go to the store, buy the dots, and apply them to every article of clothing in the house.

It's doing the bare minimum.", "I understand, maybe the first few times were honest mistakes. But after the nth time, I don't think they were honest mistakes, it was just simply not caring enough. Most of the time he would misplace the same type of clothes that I had already pointed out before are not mine, he would say ok, but misplace them again the next time, either give it to one of the boys, or one of the girls and or give the girls clothes to me.

If my wife gives me feedback in a way that feels disrespectful such as yelling, talking down to me, insulting me (and she rarely if ever does), I do tend to go to a defensive place. However, when she approaches a concern in a way that feels like she values me and our relationship, I am much more receptive to that feedback. Eg \u201cI know how hard your day was, and I appreciate you folding the laundry with me.  Sometimes when my clothes get mixed in with the girls clothes, it\u2019s difficult for me to find them.  One thing that would make it easier would be if I didn\u2019t have to go searching for them. I realize it\u2019s easy for me to recognize my own clothes.

If they are upset with you, you apologize and do better next time. But there\u2019s all kinds of psychological data showing that men won\u2019t listen to feedback from women unless they jump through hoops to be \u2018nice\u2019 and \u2018gentle\u2019 and \u2018friendly\u2019 about it, whereas guys just get to tell each other, \u201cHey, dude, stop messing up my shit!\u201d and their anger gets listened to and respected."]}
