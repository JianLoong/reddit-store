He was throwing up and had developed a very concerning rash and was starting to have a very high fever hovering around 102 F. I took him to urgent car to get looked at and let my partner stay home to have time off from the baby. I unfortunately left the house pretty quickly and didnt think to grab any extra toys or books. About 5 minutes away from the doctors, he threw up all over himself and the only book and toy in the car.  I only cleaned him and his seat up and set everything else aside in a bag to cleanup later. I also only had 1 extra pair of pants for him. We got to the doctors and were there for about an hour and a half. He is not fond of the doctors to begin with. I tried keeping his attention in the room by pointing. Out the limited colors and trying to explain all the equipment in the room. He didnt want to do anything after 20 minutes and was getting very fussy. Around the 1 hour mark he was very upset, scared and just overall in pain from being sick. I decided to let him watch some Thomas on my phone. It was the original show with the models, not the cartoon one that's out today. He calmed down and was happier. He only watched about 15 minutes max, then we left.  We got home and she asked what we did and I told her that we just did doctors and got some medicine from the store. At the time she had no issue with him watching the 15 minutes of thomas in the doctors, but still wasnt happy about it.\n\nHe is still sick 2 days later and last night at about 4 am he was asking to watch trains on tv. My partner got very upset and was mad I let him watch tv without any reason( he only gets tv during meals to get him to eat or also to drink a bottle of milk) she said hes been dreaming about tv in his sleep and is now addicted to tv. She was mad and told me I ruined his life and his brain(he will no longer be a smart kid) and that he dosent even want to play with any toys now because all he wants is tv. She said I was an asshole for allowing him to watch tv when I knew he isnt suppose to be watching any until hes older. \n\nI dont know if I am the asshole. I understand I broke a rule, but i was trying to make my kid feel safe and comfortable when he was scared and sick. I know if i had prepped better for the urgent care, then I wouldn't have needed to use tv.\n\n\nTldr. I let my almost 2 year old watch 15 minutes of tv to keep him calm in the doctors office after we had been there an hour due to my lack of planning and not bringing any toys or books. Partner says I'm the asshole for going against the no tv rule and ruining his life and brain.", "created_utc": 1687270746, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ecf5s/aita_for_letting_my_son_watch_tv/", "score": 38, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Most kids don't want to play with toys while they are sick, that takes too much energy.", "Your partner is a controlling creep. NTA", "NTA\n\nYour partner is an abusive parent. That\u2019s the degree of controlling they are.", "What the actual hell? No you're not the asshole and your partner sounds legit crazy. Poor kiddo. Hope he is feeling better.", "NTA.\n\nYes, screen time is not great for young kids, when they need to be developing spatial reasoning, and coordination.  However, militant parenting is more harmful long term than a little bit of screen time as a toddler.", ">\tMy partner got very upset and was mad I let him watch tv without any reason( he only gets tv during meals to get him to eat or also to drink a bottle of milk) \n\nI mean, realistically, this is kind of opposite of most people.

Weird. \n\nShe\u2019s crazy. \n\nNTA.", "Definitely NTA. Your partner sounds super controlling and overbearing & he\u2019s not ruined for watching tv outside of his allotted time. It\u2019s not going to make him any less smart either. Your comforted you sick child! Tell your patented to chill!", "NTA but you and your wife are going to be so stressed if you are that worried over every little thing. It\u2019s 15 minutes of tv\u2026 not the end of the world. You can also tell your kid, no, to watching more if you don\u2019t want him to. Yes, I understand that he\u2019s 2 and he might throw a fit, but then he\u2019ll get over it. It was a way to help you at the doctor. It\u2019s really not that big of an issue.", "NTA- rules do not apply when you\u2019ve got a truly sick kid. They need lots of down time, and laying watching TV is a way to get them to stay still. You can take the TV away when he\u2019s feeling better.\n\nBy the way, my 4.5 year old woke up this morning and threw up. She\u2019s been on the couch with the TV on and 0 energy since 7:30. Even when we color she lasts 5 minutes before telling me she\u2019s tired and laying back down. Normally we\u2019re a 0 screen time Monday-Friday family, but given the situation the rules don\u2019t apply.", "NTA, and that's a huge jump from 15 minutes of tv to the child being addicted to tv and no longer a \"smart\" child. It is good to limit the amount of tv but 15 minutes when they are sick, in discomfort and just all around fussy is ok.\n\nAs a parent I can tell you with almost 100% certainty that this tv and Thomas addiction will be gone in a few weeks, maybe a few months at most. My kid is 8 and looking back at all the things they were \"addicted\" to most didn't last for more than a few months to a few years.", "Nta. Pediatric nurse practitioner x 25 yrs here (and parent). You did the right thing. Your partner\u2019s reaction is absurd. Your child is not addicted to tv and his brain is 100% fine. Keeping him calm and distracted in that environment took priority for his own sake. Illness and all kinds of upheaval changes how we parent. You kept an adaptive mindset and used your best judgement given the situation and internal/external resources available at the time. Your partner wasn\u2019t even present so they either trust you to make decisions or they show up themselves to put on a puppet show. \nBelieve me, when my husband (a pediatrician) gave our then 2 yr old son skittles (gross artificial colored candy) from a vending machine while I was in a 20 minute OB/gyn appointment I was not thrilled. I was less thrilled when 2 weeks later we were stuck in Chicago traffic and that overtired child screamed Skkkkitttttllllesssss! From his car seat for a full hour before finally sleeping. Said child is now the healthiest eater, kindest hardworking gracious human, competitive athlete/honorstudent/Eagle Scout/pilot/ 19 yr old university student. Your child will be fine. Your partner needs to understand that imperfect parenting still results in thriving happy kids. \nWho are also imperfect. There needs to be some grace readily extended in this journey on both sides of the equation.", "NTA.  You do what you gotta do when your kid is sick.   \n\nHonestly, your partner seems irrationally upset that this rule was broken.  Is she always like this or is she maybe over-tired and stressed from having a sick baby?", "NTA - you're his parent, too.", "This is absolutely ridiculous. \n\nNTA. A moderate amount of TV isn't going to rot the kid's brain. If he's stupid it's because your partner is a control freak who excessively limits what the kid is exposed to.", "Nta\n\nSo tv is okay when he needs to be bribed to eat but not when he needs to get better? Idgi. If anything I'd say the first one is more damaging lol", "If he gets TV time during meals to \"get him\" to eat, then that's significantly more likely to lead to an unhealthy relationship with TV than 15 minutes while he's sick. Your partner is being very hypocritical if what you did is a problem but putting on a show to persuade him to eat isn't. NTA", "NTA - You get to make decisions as well.", "\"She was mad and told me I ruined his life and his brain(he will no longer be a smart kid) \"  \nOh well, the damage is done so there's no point in limiting screen time anymore!  He can watch TV all the time now that his brain is ruined.   \nNTA and your partner is a controlling jerk.", "NTA, and your partner is behaving bizarrely. Obviously limits on TV time go out the window at urgent care, obviously 15 minutes of TV will not ruin a child's life, and you are also a parent and get to have input into the rules about TV in your house. Go directly to couples therapy, do not pass go.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

It's a small issue to watch some TV and age appropriate. It's not like you let your child watch for the first time ever and he's developed an addiction. Addiction doesn't work that way! She needs to stop being so controlling. Also, she wasn't there! She was having a break, it's ridiculous that she even has an opinion on this.", "Definitely NTA. Yeah too much screentime may be bad for young kids but 15 min of tv won't make him addicted and ruin his life & brain. You did the only thing you could do to comfort your son at the doctor's. However your partner seems very controlling.", "NTA -- sounds like first child syndrome where you think you need everything to be absolutely perfect with the best parenting trends from the most respected sources and everything will go to plan. \n\nLife happens, you have to be flexible and work around every situation that pops up each day. She needs to be realistic and understand that parenting is not an exact science and things will not always go to plan. OBviously monitoring screentime is important, but this is too far and in a dangerously controlling territory. You don't want your child to be so sheltered that the moment they get a little bit of freedom they go wild and can't control themselves since they've been sheltered so much throughout life.", "NTA, my son was always allowed to watch tv. He now has his master in mathematics and will be getting his phd in it too. Has a very good job and his IQ is in the top 1% of the population. Tv does not make people stupid!", "NTA. I'm laughing at someone upset about a sick child watching TV for a few minutes--when that same child is allowed to watch TV during mealtimes. HELLO?!", "NTA. You did what you had to do to make your son comfortable. Your partner has some controlling issues...", "This is insane. He watched TV and is now addicted to TV, and dreams of TV, and will no longer be smart because he just wants TV. That's crazy. I think most of us have watched TV almost every day since we were born. Are we all idiots? \n\nAlso, he can never watch TV because it will break his brain... unless he's eating, then it's totally fine. What the fuck kind of logic is that?\n\nIf she literally said that you ruined your sons life and brain, she needs to seriously apologize for saying that. Those are very strong words and you can't let her just say that to you. NTA", "NTA. Poor kid remembered feeling better the last time he got to watch Thomas, and he wants that again. Being sick sucks, and he doesn\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening. Any \u201cdamage\u201d (lol) that results from him watching extra TV will be vastly outweighed by the good that comes from showing him he\u2019ll be taken care of when he\u2019s feeling bad. \n\nSesame Street was practically my third parent, and the only noticeable difference it made was that I had fully learned to read at 4 years old.", "NTA.\n\nOld-School Thomas the Tank Engine is honestly a great choice for a show if parents are worried about \"spatial reasoning skills\"- I \\*loved\\* Thomas as a kid, so my parents got me a lot of the Brio trains and I would spend hours putting them together, creating tracks, and playing with the trains on said tracks.  I wouldn't have had that same interest if I didn't watch the show, since a lot of the play was acting out stories I saw there.", "Wait a minute has no one caught this?!?!? \u201cHe only watches shows during meals?!\u201d Wtf lol.

Me, on the other hand\u2026", "NTA! You showed him a tv show at the doctors to keep him calm and comfort him while he was sick. I\u2019m pretty sure your son\u2019s life is not ruined.

Everything in moderation", "NTA.but YTA for Letting your child watch TV during  meals just so they eat that is more unhealthy than letting them watch TV while sick.. tv while eating creates unhealthy habits such as binge eating...", "Honestly, your partner seems irrationally upset that this rule was broken.", "And if you want to \"ruin\" a kid, I feel like making TV a special treat to get them to eat is a great way to mess up relationships with both screens and food.", "Hey, I was raised by TV and I turned out TV.", "Right! No matter what you do (within reason) a child can still turn out great or be a total pos. Not like you really know until they're 25 and have already picked their own life journey anyways.", "That's what she told me. That she can handle him being sick and not resort to tv. But that's at home with toys and crafts. I forgot to bring those with me because I left too quickly.", "I was more stressed with him being so sick. He honestly looks like hes gunna just pass out left the time and looks dead for a bit at a time. Prior I've been good at following her no tv rule. Just this one time I forgot to pack activities for him because I left too quickly", "I tried to tell her hes not up for much cuz hes so sick, he slept most of the day yesterday, and didnt eat much. So I figured letting him do things that will cheer him up, like treats, would help. Plus I forgot to pack activities because I left too quickly to get him looked at because his rash doubled in a half hour", "Eagle Scout... awesome! That's hard to do. I mean... the other stuff is cool too, but I know how difficult it is to get to Eagle Scout; my husband is an Eagle Scout and has taught me and our kids some really awesome things.\n\nI agree... NTA at all. With all of the severe rules / restrictions, that kid will rebel. I've watched it happen.", "This level of control is wayyyyy beyond being overly tired or stressed.", "I dont feel like one most days tho.

He\u2019s not allowed to watch tv *except* at meal times?? That\u2019s a little backwards for sure", "Only for small things, she has final say because she is the main caretaker", "Yea, he loves vehicals, and obviously I wanted to make him feel better", "Yea, he won't eat without something distracting him. I try feeding him without tv, pretending to eat his food or eat the same thing as him most times. But if it takes too long to feed him or he dosent eat in a certain timeframe, she gets upset and says to put on tv", "Not married, but she does worry over lots of things that do with his development", "Hi TV.", "Mate - I\u2019m concerned for your and your child\u2019s well-being. This isn\u2019t normal.", "Aww\u2026It\u2019s definitely what he values most of everything he\u2019s accomplished. His dad is an Eagle Scout as well and still feels the same way.", "But you are still his parent, too. Which means what you feel is best for him is valid, also. Your partner sounds incredibly controlling and needs to loosen the reins for your child's sake.", "That's not how parenting works though. You are both equal in decision making for your child, regardless if you work more than your partner does. You may want to defer to her on the day to day, and that's fine, but when it comes to what is actually best for the child you have as much right as your partner does in deciding in the moment what your child needs. You really should take a look at your partner's 'rules', and how rigid she is about them, to see if they really are in the best interest of your child. You may want to consider counseling for both of you to work together at making sure you are creating a healthy environment for your child. Your partner sounds very militant in her rules, and in the long run that will be far more damaging to your child than watching a few minutes of tv will ever be. You keep putting the blame on yourself for not packing the right activities...you were rushing your child to get medical attention. Most parents do not have the wherewithal to do more than put their child in the car in that circumstance, much less take the time to make sure they have all possible activities for their child to do while at Urgent Care. You did nothing wrong here.", "Nope.", "My son does too! He has a few ongoing medical issues (he has a rare genetic disorder) and we wouldn\u2019t have gotten through all the doctors appointments he\u2019s had without the help of Thomas and Lightning McQueen. You\u2019re doing just fine.", "That's another separate thing that's an obstacle.  I trying to give suggestions on things. But I never did the research on taking care of a kid and what they need. Plus I'm gone most of the day and have the day baby free,  so I only really help take care of him the last 3 hours of the day.", "Okay, I understand a bit. I just thought because I'm not home and not taking care of the baby for most of the day, that I dont really have the say in the bigger stuff like what he eats and how his routine is and traveling stuff. Plus the fact I dont have time to research how to take care of a kid, with the fact I only see him for about 2-3 hours most days before he goes to bed, kinda made some sense that I havent earned that part since I do very little with the hard work of taking care of him"]}
