I put a lot of effort into it so it would look good and feel at home. \nI was supposed to leave my country for a few month for work and my brother (20M) asked me if it would be ok for him to stay in it since he was accepted in a new college in my city. \nI love my brother so I said yes, and added that he could even stay for the whole year at the condition that he helped pay the rent (just the rent not the utilities that I was taking care of bc he doesn\u2019t have a lot of money) \n\nWell, I returned this morning. My brother was at my mom the entier weekend.\nMy apartment was a wreck. My curtains were slammed on the ground, my couch cover in some white seeds, paper towel (I am not dumb) on my table, crumbs on my bed, stains on my wooden floor, toilet complety wreck with still a lot of poo in it (like he didn\u2019t clean it for weeks), eggs that have gone bad and it\u2019s smell in the entier appartement, bathroom that I can\u2019t even access, etc\u2026 \n\nI cried. I was in a plane for more than 24h and I was coming home to a dumpster. I tried to call him without any answer. \nSo I called my mom, showing her the place. She then managed to told me that he was just a boy, he still have to lear, it\u2019s ok I can clean and that when I was his age I wasn\u2019t a perfect cleaner either ( by that she mean I wasn\u2019t cleaning my clothes. Not the gross stuff I just witness) \n\nI warned her, telling her that he have to come back right now and clean the place, that it was disgusting and disrespectful of me. She said he won\u2019t. I then ask her to make him pay for an hotel for me cause I wanted to sleep and take a shower. She said no he doesn\u2019t have any money for that. I told her that if he wasn\u2019t back today for cleaning, I was kicking him out. \n\nI then managed to clean my bedroom and go to bed without a shower. \n\nShe called me 10h later telling me I was an asshole and that my brother had to take an hotel bc he was to afraid to come home. \n\nI lost it. He didn\u2019t have money for me but for him he had plenty? I told her that she had always played favorite with him, that he never had consequences to his action and that he was an adult not a 15 yo kid. I was glad he was scared, I hope he cried what you do have consequences, people are gonna be mad and you have to AT LEAST apologises (which he didn\u2019t if he didn\u2019t send me a single message all day) The apartment was a dumpster and that if she couldn\u2019t understand why I was mad she should a least be worried of the living condition of my brother. \n\nNow he doesn\u2019t want to clean so I have to do it and I told him to not bother coming back. \n\nMy friends are sitting with me, saying that I did the right thing but the rest of my family said I overreacted and I shouldn\u2019t have kicked him out.\n\nSo am I the asshole ?", "created_utc": 1673817640, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10cvbsi/aita_for_kicking_my_brother_out_of_my_place_and/", "score": 132, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your brother is an immature, spoiled, inconsiderate asshole. And your mother is an enabling asshole. \n\nYou gave lots of options to make things right, which was extremely generous. He wouldn't clean up his disgusting mess. He wouldn't get you a hotel room while it was cleaned up (but magically found the money for his own hotel room). And now he's just flat-out refusing to clean his own messes? Oh, heck no! \n\nDo not let him back. Ever. He can go back to his mother if she's so worried about him.", "NTA.\n\nYour mother and your brother are massive AHs though. You shouldn\u2019t let them into your apartment ever again, and you should keep them at distance to protect your peace of mind.", "NTA, you shouldn't let your spoilt brat brother back in your apartment.", "NTA at all your mother should be ashamed of playing favorites to this level. He is 20 not 12 he should have a little more respect for your home. He was then given the opportunity to show an ounce of remorse and to fix his mess and he again chose not to do so\u2026 he was at your moms and avoiding your call because he knew how wrong it was to trash your home. You need to stick to your guns on this and let him trash his own place. Your mom clearly has his back so I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be taken care of so you need to take care of yourself here.", "NTA at all, he trashed you apartment. \n\nOn a side note it\u2019s important to understand that even though parents say they don\u2019t have a favorite they always do. And no matter what your bother does your mother will defend it cause he\u2019s clearly hers.", "NTA \n\nI\u2019m sorry your place was a mess. Your brother was irresponsible and disrespectful.", "NTA, any of the family that are saying you are can take him in.", "NTA\n\nHe completely took advantage of you. He wrecked your home. Then he hid at his mommy\u2019s house knowing you would be angry, but also that you would clean his mess up.\n\nYour mother is completely wrong. You did the right thing.", "NTA. Of course, the family thinks you overreacted and want you to continue letting him live with you. Otherwise, he\u2019s going to be living with them and they don\u2018t want to deal with his mess. He\u2019s past the age of understanding he has a responsibility to clean up behind himself.", "NTA..your brother and mother are though. Your brother will not learn anything if no one calls him to task.", "NTA If I didn't read that he was 20 I'd assume he was 10-16. 20?! He is an adult, no way an adult should make that level of a mess let alone disrespectfully do it in someone elses home. He fully deserves to be kicked out, He is lucky you didn't make him pay or fix his mess. You didn't overreact, it's very normal to be upset when someone comes into YOUR home, your safespace and wrecks it - Only to not apologize or recongize what they did wrong. Make sure he faces consequences, it's the only way he will learn.", "NTA - maybe he'll come to regret his actions in time, when he actually grows up.  Maybe he won't.  In the meantime, you stay strong.  It's your home.  Your rules.  He broke  them.  He'll need to make other arrangements.  Your family didn't smell that apartment.  I hope you took pictures at least.", "NTA. First of all, your mother is completely wrong - your brother is 20 years old, he is an adult and is (in theory) capable of making mature decisions, one of which is to take care of the home of a place where he is a guest. If this is how your mother has treated your brother over the years, I can see why he is the way he is - she has created an entitled, selfish adult, and she is enabling him.\n\nYou had every reason to be angry with him - after all, this was your home, and he treated it like a dumpster.", "NTA\n\nHe can go get some roommates and figure it out on his own. I guarantee they won't be nearly as accommodating as you have been.", "NTA. He was a terrible roommate, not on the lease and he trashed your place. This wasn\u2019t a one-night party that he didn\u2019t pick up after. This was a long-term mess that he had no intention of fixing.", "NTA.  He's living in your house. The least he could was keep it clean.  Then he doubled down by hiding from you. And your mother?! Don't let him come back. Go NC for a while. Take some breathing space.", "NTA.  That\u2019s terrible!  You totally should have kicked him out and don\u2019t let him back in.  Change the locks.  If other family members want to defend him, let them pay for his apartment (which he will wreck).\n\nat 20 years old he is not a \u201cboy\u201d.  What a bunch of crap from your mom.  Yes she babies him and shields him from the consequences of his actions.  This is setting him up for unrealistic expectations and a warped future.", "NTA - His decisions are unacceptable. Mom is stating lame excuses for what he did and yes, he is clearly the favorite. You did not overreat. He was disrespectful; hold the line of him not moving in.", "NTA. The rest of your family can have him live with them. Offer to pay for an Uber for him to their house. Do it. Problem solved. You are 100% in the right here, your brother is a LEGAL ADULT and even five year olds know to clean up their messes. Bill him for the labor for cleaning at a normal rate for cleaners in your area. When he pays it, he can come back. He won't pay it. But yes, he's lost his spot with you, he's going to have to move home. Biggest tell that this has been an ongoing problem? Your mom doesn't want him back and is trying to push you to keep him, despite him CLEARLY being in the wrong BECAUSE SHE'S TIRED OF CLEANING UP AFTER HIM TOO.", "Well, that sounds utterly gross. Your brother should never have left the place in such a mess. You shouldn't have bothered going to your mother, because she's willing to make excuses for him. He's an adult, not a child. He gets the consequences for his actions & if she wants to treat him like a baby, I guess that's her choice. She made no attempt to make things right by you, so kicking him out was entirely justified.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your brother abused your hospitality and is old enough to know better. If he were my brother he wouldn't see the inside of my home again.", "NTA - you returning wasn\u2019t a surprise, he had plenty of options, and you shouldn\u2019t have to clean up after a grown man. If your mother thinks that it\u2019s not appropriate for him to clean up after himself then she should come over and do it for him.", "NTA \n\nFrankly your mothers behavior is quite strange.", "NTA\n\nIf anyone complains ask them if they'd be willing to house the brother and clean up after that. That mess by the way is well beyond simply not knowing how to clean or something. It sounds like he had a party or something. Consider burning the sheets.", "NTA. \n\nSend him a bill for the cleaning costs, the X hours it took you at the rate ($30/hr? $50) you would have had to pay a cleanup crew to do it (or even hire one!). And the curtain replacement or cleaning costs. With pictures! Send a copy to your mother snd to any relative that bugs you about kicking him out!\n\nMake the point that You are a busy professional, not a maid to clean up after your skanky brother.", "NTA.  You offered to let your brother stay at your place for cheap and his reaction was to be disrespectful and trash the place.  When called out on it he runs and hides with mom who makes excuses for him (both AHs here).  If you let him off the hook for this time then it will be repeated again and again.  Stop that behavior now for his own good.  Once cleaned up do not ever let him or your mother ever set foot into a place of yours.  You can meet up at neutral locations like parks and restaurants, or even their homes if you want to, but make yours off limits to them as they disrespect you and your living space and make excuses for it.", "NTA\n\nTake pictures of everything and hang onto them in case you need to show them to your mom or him again. Change your locks and never let him in your space again.. You are absolutely not overreacting.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
