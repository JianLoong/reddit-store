Also it would not be possible without my amazing mother\u2019s side family (mom, uncle and grandparents). They pay for my studies, my home, my food, and everything else I could ever need or want. They\u2019re amazing people to me, they care about me, they have always been there for me. I was fully raised by them and I know they\u2019d do anything for me. My mom and uncle work HARD to pay for my college. Otherwise, there\u2019s my dad. He\u2019s absent since I know myself as a kid, he never cared about me, he was not a good father and was an awful husband to my mom when they were married 20 years ago. We never spoke until I sued him 6 years ago for not paying alimony. Then, he started making some calls, talking to me like once a month. He never apologized and never admitted he was absent because he wanted to. He subtly blames my mom, like she didn\u2019t let him see me (which I know and remember is not true, when I was a kid she tried hard to make him keep contact with me, and he was the one that denied and avoided it). So the last time he called he mentioned my graduation party and told me \u201cI really hope you invite me to your graduation party\u201d. Tbh, I don\u2019t feel like doing it. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to my REAL family who works so hard to help me and takes care of me since I was born. He is my biological progenitor but I don\u2019t consider him my father. He was NEVER there for me (still isn\u2019t, emotionally or financially speaking).\nIt\u2019s been like 6 years since he started talking to me sometimes, but only through phone calls. He NEVER in 6 years tried to see me in person so we could look at each others eyes and talk for real. He doesn\u2019t give a fuck. I\u2019ve been dying to throw some facts in his face and telling him that no, I\u2019m not inviting him.\n\nExtra facts: he is a bad person, he has some awful opinions (including ones against science and medicine, which is exactly what I study). He also often screenshots my instagram pictures and posts them on his profile writing captions saying how much his daughter is beautiful, smart and how proud he is of my graduation, so people think he\u2019s an amazing father, all he cares about is his social status and that others see him like a good family man, but only me and family know the hell he put my mom through and how absent he was/is to me.\n\nAITA for not inviting him?", "created_utc": 1689330842, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14zcukd/aita_for_not_inviting_my_biological_father_for_my/", "score": 16, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The man has not seen you in years.  Based on your extra facts info, I think that he is probably planning on claiming full credit for your accomplishments at the party.  This puts you in the position of supporting his lie to keep the peace, or turning your party into fight club.  Leave him off the list and have some really big friends there in case he decides to just show up.", "NTA. He hasn\u2019t earned an invitation. Quite the opposite.", "Nta, block him on Instagram. You don\u2019t \u201cowe\u201d him anything. You know this. He knows this. But he\u2019s trying to make you feel guilty for what he\u2019s done (having no relationship). Don\u2019t fall for it.
