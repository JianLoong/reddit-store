You do need to be aware though that considering how she is acting, she could punish you for doing so and you need to judge if it is worth it.

My mum's older brother lied so much that he created an entirely different past and raised his kids to believe it. My mum lies like your mum with the whole DARVO thing. Same with my eldest brother. I thought my mum's half brother had escaped it, until he told me that the river I lived next to had no fish in it, and I'm like yes it does, the house actually has windows that see right down in the water, it is full of fish, even huge fish. But he turned the whole conversation around, complete DARVO on me. I just thought, oh you didn't escape the family curse at all.  Their father was physically and mentally abusive and their mother was often mentally ill, so they had to go into a home a lot, that had a very bad rep for abuse, so I do not know if it is a reaction to abuse, or a genetic thing. You cannot reason with them at all, because of their extreme self interest, you can only get away from them.", "He didn't demand her to walk out, he didn't point a weapon at her and tell her to do something.\n\nShe walked out on her own because she wanted to avoid the hard conversation.
