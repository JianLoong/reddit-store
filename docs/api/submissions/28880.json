Your mother is TA for infantalising him by dismissing his choices and ignoring his side of the story. \n\nAs an autistic adult, we're aware of our own needs and limitations and should be allowed to make our own decisions regarding them. Many of us are aware that our restrictive diet is not the healthiest, and appreciate opportunities to try broadening it in a safe environment. Finding new foods you like is something to celebrate. Thank you for listening to your brother and letting him have a say in how he wants to handle his own needs. You did the right thing. \n\nCan the pasta be made without the prawns? Often when there's an indredient that one of my family doesn't like my mum puts everything else in first, then serves one or two portions before adding the prawns/mushrooms/meat/whatever.

Sounds like your mum does not want to bother with making a range of food... I am SO grateful that as a child my dad just let me eat off his plate when i was younger as I have 0 food issues now.

When I read the title I def thought the story was going to be you refusing to make the safe food for your lil bro, but you helped him try new things! As an autistic person with ARFID, finding new foods that I can enjoy is so so important! You never know when you might go somewhere that doesn\u2019t have your safe food, and even so, diversifying the foods that one eats for nutrition and vitamin intake can be crucial! Forcing a young person (especially a neurodivergent one) to eat a food they hate can be harmful, but likewise, telling them they aren\u2019t allowed to eat something just because you don\u2019t want them to can be highly detrimental.

Suddenly he does it for you, and now he wants it all the time and she can\u2019t stand that food.  I am the parent of an autistic kid and I can absolutely see this.  Sometimes he will open up for someone else in a way he won\u2019t open up for me.  It\u2019s worse when the other person assumes I haven\u2019t been trying.

So, if I make jambalaya, I\u2019ll put the chicken and sausage in it. Then either my daughter or husband will saut\u00e9 some shrimp for the two of them to add to theirs.\n\nAlso, my kids alternate cooking one night a week. One week, my 12 year old will cook one night. The next week, my 13 year old will cook one night.

How many of the things that your brother 'can't have' because of his Autism just happen to cross over with things your mum doesn't want?\n\nNot an accusation exactly, but worth considering. She might not even be doing it on purpose. Also the fact that your brother has ASC/ASD means the likelihood of your family also displaying symptoms is much higher (it's called the Broader Autistic Phenotype and I loved it during my degree because it abbreviates to BAP, which is a bread roll). I should point out that I have ASC/ASD in my family and friend group, so my perspective on the condition is generally quite positive and me making that suggestion is in no way a negative thing.\n\nNo, you're NTA.
