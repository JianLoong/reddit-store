Your mother is TA for infantalising him by dismissing his choices and ignoring his side of the story. \n\nAs an autistic adult, we're aware of our own needs and limitations and should be allowed to make our own decisions regarding them. Many of us are aware that our restrictive diet is not the healthiest, and appreciate opportunities to try broadening it in a safe environment. Finding new foods you like is something to celebrate. Thank you for listening to your brother and letting him have a say in how he wants to handle his own needs. You did the right thing. \n\nCan the pasta be made without the prawns? Often when there's an indredient that one of my family doesn't like my mum puts everything else in first, then serves one or two portions before adding the prawns/mushrooms/meat/whatever.

When I read the title I def thought the story was going to be you refusing to make the safe food for your lil bro, but you helped him try new things! As an autistic person with ARFID, finding new foods that I can enjoy is so so important! You never know when you might go somewhere that doesn\u2019t have your safe food, and even so, diversifying the foods that one eats for nutrition and vitamin intake can be crucial! Forcing a young person (especially a neurodivergent one) to eat a food they hate can be harmful, but likewise, telling them they aren\u2019t allowed to eat something just because you don\u2019t want them to can be highly detrimental.

Suddenly he does it for you, and now he wants it all the time and she can\u2019t stand that food.  I am the parent of an autistic kid and I can absolutely see this.  Sometimes he will open up for someone else in a way he won\u2019t open up for me.  It\u2019s worse when the other person assumes I haven\u2019t been trying.

So, if I make jambalaya, I\u2019ll put the chicken and sausage in it. Then either my daughter or husband will saut\u00e9 some shrimp for the two of them to add to theirs.\n\nAlso, my kids alternate cooking one night a week. One week, my 12 year old will cook one night. The next week, my 13 year old will cook one night.

How many of the things that your brother 'can't have' because of his Autism just happen to cross over with things your mum doesn't want?\n\nNot an accusation exactly, but worth considering. She might not even be doing it on purpose. Also the fact that your brother has ASC/ASD means the likelihood of your family also displaying symptoms is much higher (it's called the Broader Autistic Phenotype and I loved it during my degree because it abbreviates to BAP, which is a bread roll). I should point out that I have ASC/ASD in my family and friend group, so my perspective on the condition is generally quite positive and me making that suggestion is in no way a negative thing.\n\nNo, you're NTA.

Thank you for sharing your experience.", "Thank you for sharing this", "There is also option 5.  She's not a good cook.\n\nThere are plenty of people who think autistic kids are fussy and just give them some fried stuff because it has salt and fat and crunch.  But ask them to cook anything other than steamed veggies or some plain pasta and they balk.  Sometimes with a texture issue, you need to actual get gud or get help with cooking to try out various ones.  For the longest time, because I was brought up vegetarian, I thought I hated meat.  Any time I had steak or fish or chicken, I'd just barf from the texture.  It was like rubber.  Turns out, I'm fine with the flavor - just not the texture.  And now, I love chorizo.  Good chorizo.  It has not of the rubberiness and its umani is complemented by all the spices in it.  I also love chicken stock and sushi (not sashimi) because the crab meat has been ground.\n\nSteamed broccolli, yuck.  Cabbage in salad - no thanks.  Plain rice or pasta - FUCK NO.  Sweet pumpkin or sweet beets - HELL NO.  Boiled beans or brussel sprouts - GET FUCKED.\n\nBut I like everyone of those in a different context.", "Haaa so mum isn\u2019t biologically related to brother I guess?

I'm old enough now that I can cook my own meals, but she still said that if I cooked that dish, she would make an exception to her diet and eat some just to show support and solidarity. \n\nIn my experience, the best parents of autistic kids find a middle ground where they aren't forcing their kids to try new things if they aren't ready, but also aren't keeping their kids away from things they might like because of personal preferences. I doubt a day will ever come where I like a food or dish that my parents don't, but I know if that happens they'll be nothing but excited.

All my mother ever served was either raw veggies or steamed, barely seasoned, frozen mixed vegetables. I ate them but once I moved out I didn\u2019t eat vegetables much for the longest time because that was the only preparation method I was familiar with and I hated it.

There were several things my family didn't eat when I was a kid, mostly as a result of my dad's food issues. He's not diagnosed, but I was diagnosed this past year (as an adult).\n\nI wasn't \"allowed\" to be picky as a kid. It was \"sit at the kitchen table until you eat those Brussels sprouts - doesn't matter that you can't handle the texture.\" I had a short-ish list of things I hated the texture of (sprouts, raw tomatoes, mashed potatoes) that were included in family meals because dad would eat them - my preferences weren't really taken into consideration.", "Exactly what I was thinking.", "I didn't like the things my mother didn't like to eat.

Because Autistic people often have a more direct line (so to say) to sensory input it likely takes us longer to dull some of the food sensory impacts that NT people do as the years go on. Over time we also dull and are able to eat more food but at a later time. Sort of like getting desensitized to capsaicin.  You start off walking it really strong and as you eat it more and more the hotness fills and you need more pepper or stronger pepper to get that same buzz.", "I found that too! I have an autistic kiddo, and I found that we'd go for months or years without any changes to diet, then all of a sudden, they're eating all sorts of different stuff! The key is to keep offering new things, so that when they're up for it, they try it, and they may like it. :)", "My stepson was like this! Nothing wrong, he just learned when he was really little but he could use food to control his parents who were divorcing at the time. So he would tell Mom Daddy doesn't make me eat anything but chicken nuggets and he would tell Dad Mommy doesn't make me eat anything but chicken nuggets and he always got his chicken nuggets and french fries!\n\nThen comes along the mean ole stepmom who decides there's a two-bite rule. Take two bites of dinner and if you really don't like it we can make you a peanut butter and jelly or some ramen or even the chicken nuggets in the freezer. Boy were they shocked when he started eating stuff! I didn't force him to eat an entire plate, just a few bites and then we can switch to whatever you want so after the first couple times he just started taking the two bites with no fuss. Then he found out that he liked more and more till it went from he will only eat one thing, to the five or six things that I knew he would never eat but he ate everything else.
