My uncle has no children, and I am my mother's only child. I am an adult with my own family (husband & child), home, career, etc. I was close with my grandfather (and was close to my grandmother who passed 6 yrs ago).  \n\n\nMy mother is currently in our home town with my uncle, dealing with the death. She called and walked me through a story about how as a family tradition, my grandmother wanted the trust to be split between her and my uncle, 50/50, and then I would get this other small amount (to equal about 5% of the total assets). My grandfather at some point got mad at my mother's husband and changed it to 50(uncle)/25(mom)/25(me). Then the last time it was changed, my grandfather made it where the three of us will receive 1/3 each.  \n\n\nDuring this call, she basically got me to agree that my grandmother would have wanted the trust to be split between her and my uncle, 50/50, and then I would get this other small amount (to equal about 5% of the total assets). They mentioned if I gave them 50/50, that they would give me a little extra, which would equal out to about 10% or less of the end total after assets are liquidated. She had me tell my uncle that I agreed with her. They both told me that I am a good person, that I am doing the right thing, and that they love me.  \n\n\nI've now had a day to think for myself, and I feel maybe they are trying to take advantage of me. I also am still grieving (he passed less than a week ago) and this situation has me feeling like my relationship with my grandfather, and his wishes, is being dismissed. I am really hurt that they aren't thinking about me. My mother would not stop calling and texting me, so I finally answered, and she could tell I was upset. I was honest with her and said I was rethinking the situation and maybe I want to honor my grandfather's wishes. She sounded very upset.   \n\n\nI want to do the right thing here but I don't know what that is. The way this was presented to me makes me feel they are trying to take advantage of me during this time, but maybe it was my fault for agreeing when I was caught so off guard. If I received the 1/3 I am currently entitled to, it would be life changing for my family in terms of stability and security.  \n\n\nSo I guess, in summary, WIBTA if I honored my late grandfather's will as is, splitting his estate 3 ways between my mother, uncle, and myself? Should I maybe agree to take a lesser percentage, but not just the very small amount they are wanting to give me after they take 50/50?

It's not legally binding, so long as you didn't sign anything.\n\nIt's shameful that they said you were \"doing the right thing\" and \"you're a good person\" and \"they love you\" AFTER you allowed them to pressure you into giving up what your grandfather very clearly meant YOU to have.  \n\nIt DOES kind of sound like your grandfather anticipated that if he did not specifically put you in the will, you would have gotten nothing from his children.  He changed the will TWICE, giving you more each time. That was very deliberate.\n\nThe thing you need to do, though, is make peace with yourself about the fact that if you stick to the will as-is, your relationship with your mother and uncle may be damaged forever.  They're already making a fuss.  They don't sound like they're just going to shrug and say okay.  EITHER they will stop talking to you and badmouth you to the rest of the family, OR they will keep harassing you.  Both are unacceptable.\n\nThey've treated you so badly already that for me, it would make the decision easier.  They aren't treating you well and they tried to manipulate you while you were grieving.  They treated you badly first.  (You are NOT treating them badly by sticking to the will.)  For me, that would break trust, especially with my mother.  I'm not sure what it would take for me to feel they had apologized enough for me to allow bygones to be bygones.  This would really sour my relationship with relatives.\n\nAll of that might be very painful for you to contemplate right now. You've lost your grandfather, and it may be distressing to lose your mother and uncle over some percentage points in what sounds like a substantial inheritance.\n\nJust realize that if you do lose them over this, it's because of THEM.  Not you.  They're the ones forcing the issue.  They don't respect your grandfather's wishes (while \\*claiming\\* to respect your grandmother's wishes more). They don't really respect you.  Their love is conditional.  That isn't how you should be treated.", "NTA- and I would just say- yeah, my bad, I let myself get twisted up in that conversation. We all have 100% proof positive of what was wanted in the form of the will and I'm going to honor it. \n\nYou should not honor the wishes of those who are trying to steal from you. And that's what I would tell them when pressed.  To them:  I understand you'd like more, who wouldn't, but at the point that you're trying to swindle it out from under my or make up some things that aren't in evidence, I'm not going to listen to that any further. Your opportunity to make this case was with grandfather. You didn't or you otherwise failed. This is my last on this subject.

You have a partner and kids who will also benefit, your uncle doesn\u2019t, and your mom should be happy for you.

Lawyer up and do not give them anything. Your grandfather made the will exactly as he wanted it and her \"family tradition\" story is a crock.", "NTA.

As for 'tradition' - that too is so much bullshit - if it was such an important tradition, your grandfather would have cared about it. He didn't. It's telling that this 'tradition' benefits them. \n\nI don't know your mom or your uncle, or their situations, but based on what they are trying to do, I'm not massively their fan.\n\nYour grandad wanted you to have a fair share. Honour his wishes, just like your mother should be.", "Give yourself more than a day to think about it.  Take your inheritance and take a year to consider what you want to do.

You can always change your mind later if you wish.\n\nNTA", "NTA, but holy hell, your mom and uncle are for sure. Get an estate attorney immediately. They have already made their plan to take your portion incredibly clear. Estate law gets ugly, and they could say things you'd never expect in an effort to get that money. I'm sorry that you are being actively preyed on by your family. Surely, it hurts. But please believe what they are telling you about themselves and lawyer up now.", "Why in the world would you agree to the money just going to your mom and uncle when your grandfather obviously wanted his money split three ways? Your mother and uncle are trying to take advantage of you. NTA.", "Nope NTA - people get so greedy and awful when death and money are involved. I agree with the person who suggested consulting an attorney, especially if it\u2019s a large sum. Your piece of mind is worth a few hundred bucks. I\u2019m sorry for your loss and that you\u2019re dealing with drama on top of it.", "NTA. Your grandfather changed the Will when he was angry. But then he later changed it again. Each time, he increased your share. This was not a heat of the moment decision. He did it on two separate occasions. This is what he wanted. You have nothing to feel guilty for. Your mom and her brother are perhaps greedy, or perhaps trying to reframe their relationship with their father to process grief/guilt. Either way, they can discuss that with a therapist. Keep your share. Your grandfather intended it for you.", "Your grandfather changed his will at least twice, so you know exactly what his wishes were.  If he wanted you to have only 5%, he would have written 5% to you in the will.\n\nYou need to contact the attorney handling the estate and tell them what is going on so that your mother and uncle don't try to cheat you that way.\n\nNTA", "Your grandfather's will reflects his wishes. Don't agree to any changes. NTA. Your mother is however", "NTA.\n\n*maybe* trying to take advantage? get real, **they are!**\n\ndo not speak with any of them. get your own copy of the will. hire a lawyer. do not sign anything.\n\n\\#\n\ni think if grandfather had the time to re-write the will a 4th time he would increase your portion again. thus making sure that you, maybe your husband but certainly your child are taken care off.\n\nthis is what he wanted, this is what he said clearly through his wills: he decreased uncle's and mom's portion of the inheritance and increased yours. not once, no, but 2 times. so it was not a mistake, it was his intention, his motive, his will.\n\nso 'don't spit on his grave', dishonor him by not getting the share he wanted you to have.\n\nand be prepared: one of the worst enemies you will encounter in your life is a familymember feeling entitled to your inheritance. in your case your mother.\n\n'woe me, woe me, my own child is robbing me' posts on facebook, 'how could she do this to me' sobbing on cousin berta's shoulder, 'i have to move / sell / downsize 'cause daughter influenced father to inherite' gossiping to neighbors.\n\nignore your mom and uncle.\n\nget quality time with your hubby and child.\n\nrespect your grandfather's wishes,\n\ni am sorry for your loss.\n\n\\# eta since copy / paste didn't work as i wanted:\n\nas for grandmother's wishes, is this anywhere in writing, did she have a will of her own? or do you have just your mothers words for it?", "NTA you don't owe them a dime", "NTA the only one who\u2019s opinion matters is the person who\u2019s money it was.
