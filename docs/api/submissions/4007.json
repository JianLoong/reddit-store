Her high school had a costume contest for Halloween. My daughter and her friends planned a group costume to enter. She went with her friends after school to buy costumes. \n\nI picked her and her friends up from the store and they showed me their costumes. My daughter spent 80$ on hers. I was pissed that\u2019s a lot of money to spend on something your going to wear for a few hours. Very irresponsible use of money. I told her as much in the car told her it was ridiculous. I dropped her friends off and took her back to the store to return the costume and accessories. \n\nHer friends found someone eles to take her place in the group and they won the contest and a 100$ visa gift card to split. My daughter came home from school on Halloween upset she claimed she had to sit and watch while her friends had fun and she missed out on everything. I pointed out to her after splitting the gift card it would be way less then she spent on the costume and it was only a few hours but she didn\u2019t want to listen to reason. \n\nNow a month later and she is still moody and mostly ignoring me. My ex husband told me I made her miss out and she works so much she missed out on a lot of stuff with her friends and I could have let her have this. But at the end of the day I saved her 80$. I just trying to teach my daughter how to be responsible with money she could have gotten a cheap costume especially since I she would have only worn it for a few hours.", "created_utc": 1670244919, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zd62bi/aita_for_making_my_daughter_return_a_halloween/", "score": 10605, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She can reuse it another time! \n\nJust being her parent doesn't give you control of money she earns through her work.", "YTA.  She had spent her own money on the costume and the point of the contest was to have fun with her friends. The $100 prize was irrelevant.\n\n$80 for a wonderful memory and experience.

This is HER money that she earns on TOP of doing school every day. You had no right to tell her to return the costume, and she has every right to be angry. All you did was ostracize her from her friend group. For $80. \n\nYou took away memories and experiences and wonderful, friendship-bonding moments for $80. \n\nCan't wait for the day you tell her not to bother with a graduation gown or bridal dress or anything else that she'll only spend a few hours in because the memories aren't worth the money!\n\nGo apologise to your daughter.", "YTA, especially if it was her owned earned money.

Making memories and having fun are huge parts of growing up and you took what should have been a great moment and life long memory away from her to save 80.00. So while that money sits in the bank you not only belittled your daughter in front of her friends, dictated what she can spend money she earned on, you also did damage to your relationship with your child. Is 80.00 worth all that? Make it up to her as best you can, be an adult and lead by example by apologizing to your daughter and asking her to forgive you.", "YTA, the fact that you'd rather watch your daughter miserable than give her a few hours of fun is just sad.", "Put simply, she will earn another $80, and will never earn that Halloween with her friends back.

You quite likely humiliated your 16-year-old daughter in front of her friends. Because she spent her own money on a costume to be part of the group. Then you deprived her of that opportunity. You don't get it, I'm afraid. She is old enough to make her own decisions. If you don't get on the same page with her and not expect it to be the other way around? You will lose her.

Bet they\u2019re all looking forward to Christmas.", "YTA 80 dollars for a lifelong memory of a wonderful group event with her friends?

Her money = her happiness.", "YTA\n\nSounds like she was responsible with her money and saved up to buy something she wanted.\n\nHer only mistake was trusting her mother wasn't going to be overly controlling and judgemental.

She had an opportunity to make a nice memory with her friends and she's responsible enough to earn her own money.

That could have been an awesome memory to cherish but instead she only get to learn that your version of responsibility is boring af and puts her on the outside.

What is hard to understand about that?", "YTA  \n\n\nShe's old enough to spend her own money, even if you think she's wasting it.  \nBut more importantly, that $80 wasn't only about a costume, it was for the whole experience of participating to a contest with her friends. You robbed her of a great social experience at an age when these experiences are very important to her own self-construction/identification.", "YTA. She worked hard and saved her money and spent it on what she wanted. Then you came in and decided she\u2019d spent too much and she didn\u2019t get to do something she\u2019d been looking forward to with her friends. All you taught her is that you are liable to mess up her plans if you don\u2019t agree with them.", "YTA\n\nSo you shamed her in front of her friends, berated her because she bought something you didn't deem valuable.\n\nForced her to return the costume she bought with her OWN money, something she saved up for.\n\nYou made her miss out on this fun event. Apparently a recurring occurrence going by your ex. She works FIVE DAYS A WEEK! As a teen!!\n\nYou took away her decision, her money...you made sure to use your control over her, all the while she has to study and work. Now obviously she isn't even allowed to use her money the way she wants to.\n\nEven one month later she still hates you for it, which is a clear sign how much you hurt her! \n\nYou sound terribly controlling, and cold like ice.\nYou don't even show an ounce of understanding or sympathy in your post. \n\nIf I were her I'd make sure to work during the Christmas holidays, instead of spending them with you.", "YTA and cruel", "YTA (I'm assuming that it was her own money since you said she works.) She's 16 and that's an important age for group dynamics. It was her money and you have no say in the dumbest things she spends it on. In a few years she may look back and say \"that was dumb.\" You can run the numbers and make sure she knows \"that $80 represents X hours of your work.\" You can remind her that in the future she needs to learn how to budget things like rent, food, utilities, etc. But forcing her to return the items crosses the AH line; it's not your money.", "YTA...\n\n... and beyond that, I wonder if you are planting the seeds for other things like hoarding or future money/hedonism issues. This is one of those things that sounds like a \"she'll never forget\" moment.  If your daughter worked to earn the money and spent it on something \"just for fun\" but is otherwise more practical, who cares?  A teen should be allowed to have fun every now and again in life, especially as she isn't hurting herself or others.", "YTA.", "YTA it was her money. Also did you ever see a wedding dress? Same principle. Let her have fun.", ">\tBut at the end of the day I saved her 80$.\n\nThis is why your daughter is upset. You showed her that you value money more than her experiences as a teenager.

It was your daughter's money.  She earned it and therefore had a right to spend it on something she wanted no matter how frivolous that purchase might be.  Plus, this wasn't just a costume.  It was a chance for your daughter to belong and feel a part of her group of friends in a very appropriate way!   Why would you take that away from her?    Instead of making her take the costume back, you could have sat down with her and talked about what else she could get with that $80.  But you also need to understand that sometimes an experience is more valuable than a tangible thing.  To your daughter, being a part of that group and participating in that contest might have been far more valuable than a new pair of jeans.  You need to go to your daughter and say that you were wrong and apologize.  Parents need to say the words **I WAS WRONG, and I AM SORRY** when they apologize.", "YTA\n\n1. It was your daughter's money. People, including your daughter, are allowed to spend their own money. By policing how she spends her money you're going to cause her to either feel guilty about ever buying herself something nice or to be extremely secretive with you about her spending habits. \n\n2. You caused her to miss out on a fun event with her friends. She got to watch them wear their costumes and win a contest. They have this fun memory. All she'll remember is how you made her sit out.\n\n3. $80 isn't a lot when it comes to costumes. Especially since you said she also bought accessories. Good quality costumes can run significantly higher than that. \n\nYou sound like the Halloween Grinch.", "YTA \n\nHalloween costumes tend to be expensive but it doesn\u2019t look like you couldn\u2019t afford it.\n\nYou could have let this incident slide and explained your opinions on financial responsibility to your daughter. \n\nIt was a group thing your daughter had with her friends and you robbed her of that fun experience", "YTA get of your high horse, your daughter is 16 and she works after school 5 days a week, let her have some fun. Only thing you taught her is to not share information about price of things with you.", "YTA, If she is working, then it\u2019s HER money to spend..\n\nThis post made very thankful my parents let me do what I wanted with MY money from my job. \nOne $80 costume isn\u2019t going to break her for life.", "YTA OP.

She works and earns money and spent her money on a costume (at least it sounds like she spent her money, if she spent yours it would be a different story).  While I agree, $80 is a lot of money for something she would have worn for a few hours, it was her money.

You didn't teach her an important fiscal lesson like you smugly surmise, you taught her to put you on an information diet regarding her purchases, her plans with her friends,  and probably more.

She's not being moody, she's justifiably pissed at you for unilaterally undoing what would have been a great experience.", "YTA.

Let her figure out what she wants to spend it on.", "YTA, just for berating her in front of her friends. Please learn to speak to your daughter as if she\u2019s an adult capable of her own choices, or she will stop speaking to you altogether.", "YTA. She used her own, hard-earned money for something she wanted to do. Since you clearly missed the point, it wasn't the costume that was important to her, it was the experience with her friends. That's what you excluded her from.", "YTA\n\nIt was her money! If you were trying to show her that saving is important, and maybe spending so much money on something \"frivolous\", you went about it the wrong way.\n\nBeing money smart is prioritizing spending. If this event was really important to her, it wasn't frivolous. The lesson should have been, \"you know $80 is a lot of money, if you spend it on this, you won't have it for other things, and I'm not going to get them for you, just because you don't have enough money.\" Then let her make the decision.\n\nAlso, did you start yelling at her about the price in the car while her friends were still there? That would make you an extra AH\n\nParenting isn't about forcing your children to do what you want them to, it's about growing them into a successful adult. Allowing her to create her own priorities is one of those things.\n\nETA: also, \"I saved her $80\", but what you cost her was a potential lifelong memory of that one Halloween when we all dressed up and won the prize. Now she has the lifelong memory of her mother prioritizing $80 of daughter's own money, over her daughter's own happiness and well being.\n\n Furthermore, you know it's possible to sell the costume later, right?

You can explain a concept all you want, but until they experience it for themselves, the lesson is lost. She needs to be in a situation where she literally doesn't have the money, because SHE already spent it on something frivolous. Only then will the \"aha!\" moment of understanding occur.  What you are doing is saving her from the 'pain' and not letting her stub her toe herself. You aren't doing her any favors because if she is not learning how to avoid the painful situations when they are small, then she will end up having to learn the lesson later in life when they may be bigger.   Additionally, I would point out that wisdom and confidence comes from having experiences: the costume event was full of experiences (team work, creative thinking, public performance, handling wins/losses gracefully) you denied her a chance to build up more life experience.

Her high school had a costume contest for Halloween. My daughter and her friends planned a group costume to enter. She went with her friends after school to buy costumes. \n\nI picked her and her friends up from the store and they showed me their costumes. My daughter spent 80$ on hers. I was pissed that\u2019s a lot of money to spend on something your going to wear for a few hours. Very irresponsible use of money. I told her as much in the car told her it was ridiculous. I dropped her friends off and took her back to the store to return the costume and accessories. \n\nHer friends found someone eles to take her place in the group and they won the contest and a 100$ visa gift card to split. My daughter came home from school on Halloween upset she claimed she had to sit and watch while her friends had fun and she missed out on everything. I pointed out to her after splitting the gift card it would be way less then she spent on the costume and it was only a few hours but she didn\u2019t want to listen to reason. \n\nNow a month later and she is still moody and mostly ignoring me. My ex husband told me I made her miss out and she works so much she missed out on a lot of stuff with her friends and I could have let her have this. But at the end of the day I saved her 80$.

Before I got to the end of your comment I had \u201cnatural consequences\u201d in my head. OP is TA for so many reasons. What a mean mean thing to do to her.", "Are you kidding? That kid will be NC after college.", "Think of how much she will save sticking her in the crappy nursing home.", "She can rest in the knowledge that the $80 she \"saved\" her daughter will go towards commissary at the old folks home she'll be placed in!", "If she even does that much for her.", "Do you mean Shady  Pines?", "Most states don't have filial responsibility laws. My mother will likely end up under a bridge because I sure as shit won't be paying for a nursing home.", "Never related to a post on here more lol.", "Absolutely. Op's daughter now knows better than to waste money on something as frivolous as a retirement home.", "I've worn the same costume almost every year for the past 10+ years. I bought it with my own money as a teenager, and it cost over $100. I'm glad my mom didn't react like OP!", "Nursing homes are a waste of money, think of all the money OP's daughter will save by letting her mother rot alone at home with no one who gives 2 s**t about her /s", "I snorted out loud with this one.", "Let's be honest, your being incredibly generous. Not all States have filial laws, and those laws have never been tested in the US Supreme Court to see if they violate the 13th Amendment.  \n\n\nMeaning, OP's daughter could just go \"no contact\".", "We have nurses at home.\n\nAnd by nurses, I mean Dr. Phil on TV and a cat that licks its ass in front of company.", "There\u2019s always a van down by the river.\n\nIt\u2019s also the most budget friendly option!", "YTA. You\u2019ve made yourself out to be an uncaring tyrant who makes all decisions. Controlling money thats not even yours to spend is financial abuse. Forcing her to return the costume IN FRONT of her friends is so embarrassing for a 16 year old. \n\nYou\u2019ve isolated her from an outing with her friends because YOU decided that was the right thing to do. This is a high schoolers worst nightmare. \n\nIm not surprised your ex-husband is your EX-husband.", "I'm imagining the OP forcing her daughter to return an $80 Disneyland ticket because the paper the ticket is printed on isn't worth $80.", "She will just point blank start lying by omission to her mother.\n\nLike way to to go OP - for the low, low cost of $80 (that was never yours to spend or revoke!), you ensured you will never have a fully transparent conversation with your daughter for the rest of her teenage and young adulthood!\n\n*Show her what she's won Johnny!*\n\nPlans, financial or practical, will never be shared with you! You have forever become the Bad Cop/Fun Police Parent and have ensured your ex-husband will always be the Favoured and Preferred Parent! Good luck never having the full security or knowledge of what your daughter is doing, or who she's doing whatever with and where or when! For good or bad! Even when or if she is struggling financially, she will now only come to you as a last ditch resort because she recognizes that you will ride her ass about this before being helpful to her and she would rather prolong the consequences of that than be proactive in her fiscal situation! And by the time she comes to you, said fiscal issue will probably be too far gone to really come back from without taking further damage! You have now created \"The Thing\" that your daughter will *never forget* about you and will subconsciously judge you by forever!\n\nWe hope you enjoy your prize!", "I thought the issue was going to be the costume was widely inappropriate for a 16 year old.", "Like literally Hank Hill, the hallmark of strict parenting, understands you can't dictate what your child spends their money on if they've earned it themselves.", "Wow I\u2019m sorry he did that. How tf did that ruin Xmas? Poor you. You didn\u2019t deserve it", "Indeed. Whatever lesson OP wanted her daughter to learn, went out the window when she , shortsightedly took away her right to spend her own money, in such a public, and humiliating way.  \nOp's daughter may one day forgive this act, but she will certainly never forget it.", "Self regulation is something all teens need to learn. Wow, what an AH OP is. And an apology from her won\u2019t begin to cover this", "A few years ago I worked retail at a kids store that highly recommended we dress up for Halloween. I bought a superman tee that had a cape attached, some tights and a matching skirt. Not only did i wear it both Halloweens i was employed there, i wore it on the last Halloween before Covid and would happily wear it to a convention", "Exactly. The OP stole a wonderful memory from her daughter. You can\u2019t get those back.", "YTA. The girl works 5 days a week! That's pretty responsible/ motivated. I guarantee the memories she would have made being part of a fun group costume would have been worth more than whatever that $80 will buy, that's Mom- approved.", "Yup.  The lesson here wasn't \"spend your money wisely\", it was \"mother has control issues.\"", "Same experience, with my sister and some space stations we built; never forgot.", "Totally this.\n\nLike even if the other teens aren't retaliatory, there's still the fact now the majority of the friend group has a precious moment to bond over that OP's kid can't relate to and was forced to be a spectator of.\n\nThe other girls don't even *have* to henpeck OP's kid for that to still present an emotional schism in the social circle. It's like when everybody sees a movie that you haven't or has an inside joke that's contextual to a moment you weren't there for - it makes you feel like tourist amongst your friends.\n\nAnd being a teenager amplifies that feeling of separation, of being outside looking in. Like, is it any wonder two months later the daughter is still upset?", "You know what lesson I'd get out of this, if I were OP's daughter?\n\n\n\"I need to conceal the things I do with my friends, the places I do them at, and the people I do them with, or risk getting yelled at.\"\n\n\nIn other words, OP might be setting her daughter up to put herself in risky situations (which is fairly normal for teens/young adults) *without* the benefit of adult backup.", "\"Because if I don't my asshat mother will attack me in front of my friends and humiliate me, better not tell her and wing it myself\"", "Loooool. \n\nWith my first paycheck I took Mom out for dinner...  So I'm not sure I agree with your daughter's purchase but I do agree with your parenting", "You took her out to dinner with your first paycheck?! As a Mom myself this 100% melted my heart. You\u2019re a good person CrazyIrishWitch.", "It's amazing how many people with kids end up alone in nursing homes or don't have visitors in the hospitals because they have treated their kids badly.", "And you\u2019re generous, I wouldn\u2019t even have put him in a cavern. Just under the rock would\u2019ve been fine for me", "Exactly, she\u2019s already dug her hole. Apologizing won\u2019t un-embarrass her daughter or build a time machine to get back the experience she missed. This is a hurt she\u2019ll carry forever. 20 years from now her daughter will be reading a post by some kid on AITA whose mom ruined something for her, and she\u2019ll be like \u201cthis reminds me of a time in high school when my AH mom\u2026\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t believe me, just check out these comments. A lot of people in here still harboring resentment over shit their parents did decades ago. I know I am.", "Awww ty!  Yep.  Since then, the first xmas present and the first purchase i make with my paycheck went to mom", "My mom was my bessst friend. I struggled to get through school but at one point my career skyrocketed. I spoiled the hell out of that wonderful woman that year! She passed away suddenly 3 years ago. I\u2019m glad I got to spoil her while I could. Keep showing your mama love, cherish her.", "YTA. You could've made your case, but allowed her to make her decision. It's her money she worked for, she should be allowed to occasionally spend. Your daughter is a kid, but only once in the grand scheme of things. Why ruin a good time and bonding experience over $80. Seriously, not cool.", "YTA. It's fascinating the chasm between what you say you want to teach your daughter and what you actually did, and how you learned nothing at all yourself.\n\nWhat's the point of having money if you can't use it to spend on things you want?\n\nWhat's the point of working if you can't spend your own money?\n\nYour daughter knew exactly how much that money cost in hours spent and she invested it in social bonding and a wonderful project together with her friends. You ripped it from her and remain heartless about it. You punished her for not having the same economic goals you do; it wasn't that she broke any rules, or aspect money allocated for something else. Arbitrary punishment is toxic. And punishment should me a last resort. Experience is the true teacher. Even supposing you were right about it being a waste of money, it was her money to waste. She has to have the freedom to make her own mistakes. To test her spending instincts. To evaluate whether her spending decisions paid off for her. She should be free to explore this with her own money.\n\nWhat she learned is that her mother is heartless and controlling. She will not tell you another time how she spends hey own money. She will not ask you for advice on budgeting or how to handle peer pressure to spend more than she's comfortable with. You've made sure to make that impossible. What a shame.", "Who\u2019s gonna ask OP if she wore a wedding dress to her wedding with her ex husband? Talk about a waste of money", "Yeah honestly this is really bumming me out to think about. I feel so bad for this kid.", "Wondering about this INFO myself. Unfortunately OP is being SUPER QUIET in these comments.", "I like this way of looking at it... I recently paid \u00a345 for a new pair of boots for field hockey and they'll last me for at least 2 years and possibly 5 going on my last pair...\n\nI wear them twice a week during the 22 week season plus other odd training sessions. That's about 50p a session if it's only for 2 years.\n\nI love playing hockey which makes the big initial expense absolutely worth it!", "Roughly 6 hours by my local minimum, so probably about a shift for part time. Not inconsiderable, but hardly a life changing sacrifice.", "It could also cause hoarding issues. Especially if this is what her mom does a lot. I've watched a lot of hoarders and there were a lot who had parents that would throw away their things, force them to return it, and once they grew up they weren't able to control their spending and gathering of things.", "Yes, exactly this! My thought was that this wasn't a \"waste\" of $80. It was OP's daughter buying a costume and being a part of an event, making memories, and enjoying a high school moment with her friends. Now instead of learning the value of money, OP's daughter has learned to hide what she spends money on from her mom and that being responsible by working and making her own money isn't worth it because she won't be allowed to spend that money on her own things anyway. \n\nOP - YTA.", "Right. OP YTA. Not even my mom did this and I was literally working to help out with bills and my expenses my mom didn't want me to she wanted me to spend time with my friends but she was a single mom to 6 so I decided to help.", "OMG too hilarious", "Yep. I still resent mine for some much worse things, than something basic like this. It's why when I see stuff like this on Reddit, I feel obligated to hopefully help someone see sense. Your paragraph was well written. Thanks for also doing your part to help others. (Not that it means much coming from a stranger like me lol but still).", "If you were my mom I would hate you too. Wtf", "YTA - A typical helicopter parent, ruining the chance for their child to make fun memories with their friends. She worked for her own money, she deserves to splurge every now and then and deserved to be a part of something with her friends, but you stripped her from it.", "Relatable. Any guy that is less controlling and micromanaging that lets her spend her money however she wants will seem like freedom, even if he is bad news in other ways.", "Its like an 8 hour shift at minimum wage. So like, not nothing, but also not outrageous for a special occasion, especially for a teenager who doesn't have bills.", "Yeah, daughter just wasn't paying for the costume, she was paying for the experience and the memories.  Winning that contest with her friends would have been something she remembers her entire life.  Now when she thinks about it all she will think of is what an AH her mother, OP, is.  Daughter worked for it and thought it was worth it. OP should have just let it be.", "Does OP think that only financially irresponsible people spend their money on fun or frivolous things? And the daughter is 16, is she just supposed to save all her money for when she's an adult or something?", "Honestly, I wish when I was younger, I wish my parents had taught be better money habits. Instead it was just save/don't spend was the lesson, instead of talking about budgeting, investing, compounding interest, researching fund based savings accounts, etc.\n\nI'm not saying those are all lessons a teenager has to be taught on the first paycheck, but instead teaching your kid about choices, and weighing options, etc are lessons she can take with her for life.\n\nInstead you are not teaching her anything.", "If OP is anything like my folks were? Yes, they fully expected me to never use any of my money and since our bank needs to have a co-owner on any minor's account, they knew if I used even a penny.. Idk how many times I'd hear, \"Saving are for *saving*, not for throwing away on junk.\" As if properly fitting underwear and bras were junk.", "Even trying to explain to her, \"I don't have mom logic because I am not the mommy around here. Please stop expecting me to agree with you when we have different perspectives because we are at different stages of our lives and I'm not trying to be your twin here. I'm trying to figure out how to be me!\" never worked. She could not hear me. sigh.", "Yes it is her own money.\n\n>My daughter (F16) works an after school job 5 days a week.", "I had a mom like OP and now I'm frugal to the point I recognize it as a flaw and miserly. I'm working on letting myself stop focusing only on the dollar value of things. \n\nIt's not good to have a relationship with money like the way the mom wants her to.", "Had the daughter spent the money and then regretted it, that probably would have been a better low-stakes \u201clesson\u201d about frugality than simply preventing her from spending it in the first place. People learn through mistakes. \n\n(Note: Not that I\u2019m convinced this would have been a mistake! Just saying, even if OP is convinced it was a mistake, it wasn\u2019t her job to stop it from happening.)", "Not to mention it was her fucking money!!!! (Excuse my language) she works after school 5 days a week are u kidding me OP??? Everything isn't always about money it's about the memories she was gonna make with her friends in highschool which u only get to do once YES YOUR 1000% TA!!!!!!!

I hope she does and never looks back.", "i know right, that is like forcing a bride to take a wedding dress back and saying \"i saved you $3,000.\"  \nThe money was paying for an experience she would remember for the rest of he life. \n\nalso i want to make this really clear......IT IS HER F'ING MONEY!. she can spend it how she sees fit.", "Cost her way more than $80 in happiness and now the likely humiliation that at very least is known by her friends, if not a wider circle.

I was asked to be a flowers and medal bearer for USA athletes. My grandmother refused to allow me to use her car to drive into the city because it was \u201cdangerous\u201c, and she said if I took it, she\u2019d report it stolen. I was buying the gas and insurance for it as I was driving it to college because she didn\u2019t drive anymore. She didn\u2019t understand why I moved overseas a few years later, and she lost the person driving her places."]}
