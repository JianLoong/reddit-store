Totally unreasonable for him to expect you to amend your schedule again so he can pick up his Xbox at his convenience. Maybe not the best idea to leave it out where anyone could steal it, but since he got it - he's whole. Ignore his texts and move on :)", "NTA he had plenty of chances to get his Xbox back before this and you had no obligation to put your plans on pause either. And with the way he\u2019s acted, it\u2019s good he\u2019s an ex. Yikes.", "NTA  \n\n\nHe got his stuff. He just wanted to be a jerk.", "NTA--- You gave him so many opportunities to take his belongings, he said he wanted it ASAP---so you compromised and put it outside since you couldn't meet in person. You did the best you could given the circumstances.", "NTA - if he wanted it that badly he\u2019d have come sooner! It wasn\u2019t stolen so I don\u2019t see what the problem is! Yelling at you certainly isn\u2019t gonna make you feel bad", "NTA- It's not your fault he's flopped a bunch of times before. You can't stop your life to accommodate him. I can see why he's an ex, sounds like a giant asshole, I would block him if I were you", "NTA.  He needed to work around your schedule.", "NTA\n\nAnd I wouldn't be surprised if the only reason he threatened to take you to court was to strong-arm you into cancelling your plans and force you to see him in person when he came to pick up his stuff.", "NTA- you don\u2019t owe them anything tbh. He didn\u2019t make it a priority, kept putting it off, honestly this is y\u2019all meeting in the middle\ud83d\ude02 at least you don\u2019t have a reason to talk anymore, i call it a win.", "Nta. You tried to arrange times before for him to pick his things up and he cancelled.  He demanded to get his stuff back that same day or he would start legal action.  You had plans already, so you put his stuff out on the porch where he could pick it up when you were gone. You gave him access to his stuff that day,  which is what he demanded. This is a good case of malicious compliance.", "Nta, block him and enjoy your life!", "Sounds like he cant get over the break up and by him flopping all the time gives him the \"control\" he think he has. So good for you for leaving it out there and doing what you want.", "NTA. \nYou acted in good faith on multiple occasions when he chose to decline retrieving his possessions. You obviously went beyond reasonable expectations by allowing him to \"flake\" several times and he continued to take advantage of the situation.  Personally,  the moment he accused you of \"holding his possessions hostage\", he would have been informed that he could then retrieve his possessions from the local police station, and should he choose to appear on your doorstep, the local police station has room for him AND his toys.\n\nWatch your back with this one. That kind of behaviors trouble.", "NTA. based on what you've told us, you've made efforts to return his stuff but he's been cancelling on you and wasting your time.", "NTA - all done and over now. Just block his ass and move on. Maybe next time someone tells him to come get something he'll think twice before backing out. P.S. your mom is wrong too!", "NTA. Your ex was wrong for demanding that you stay home and threatening to take you to court if you didn't give him his stuff that day. You were within your rights to leave the Xbox on the porch, as long as it was in a safe place. It's unfortunate that your ex called you names, but it sounds like you handled the situation as best you could.", "NTA.  This was the most reasonable thing to do given his flopping and how badly he seemed to have wanted the stuff back.", "NTA. I would have done the same thing. It\u2019s not like you put a free sign on it. He had multiple opportunities to collect it and canceled. \n\nHe needed to work around your schedule. Not tell you when he\u2019s going to collect it. And he yelled and threatened to take you to court over the phone? Definitely nta.", "NTA. You tried many times to get his stuff back to him. He cancelled every single time. Sounds more like he didn't want to move on. Now he has zero reason to contact you.", "Tell your mom how many times he didn\u2019t pick it up, to get her off your back. You\u2019re NTA, move on and block the Ex.", "He\u2019s a chump", "NTA. If his Xbox was so precious to him, he would have taken it with him the first time. It seems like he did all of this purposefully to keep in contact with you. Time to block him on everything! \u270c\ufe0f", "who cares if its an ex?", "It doesn't even matter, hopefully you never have to see him again.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's over.\n\nNTA", "Lol eXbox\n\n\nNTA", "NTA he\u2019s just an ex.", "NTA. He was totally fine screwing with your schedule when there was no consequence to him.  Once he was faced with a real possible loss to himself it was suddenly important.", "NTA he had plenty of chances before", "NTA. Block this loser. He got his toy back, let him go sulk. Glad you are rid of him.", "I don't know if I'd call you TA, but legally speaking you would be responsible if it had been stolen. I saw an exact court case like this where a guy left his ex's TV on the back porch and it got stolen, and he was deemed at-fault", "25 M and he's worried about an xbox?  Seems like you did well ending things with this guy.    \n\n\nLike if your games are that special, go get it.  If not, just buy a new xbox.   Quit trying to use your xbox to control your ex.", "If it got stolen or you left it in plain site then  Y W B T A and that's probably what your mom was considering when she took his side. But if it was tucked safely out the way and out of sight as much as possible from the street im going to say NTA because  theres always a chance he would flake again once youcancelled your plans or its some attempt at controlling you.  Hes just butt hurt you're over him and arent hanging off of his every word. Block him  and congrats on being free of him. He sounds tiring.", "Well kinda... it is an expensive piece of tech, and water or something could gotten in it I dunno", "Info: Could you see it from the street?", "NTA morally, but probably the A H legally had it been stolen. While in your possesion you had the responsibility to keep it safe.", "If I was op I would be laughing until I cried tears over the fact he got so damn pressed", "Are you saying that OP should've boxed the ex's Xbox?", "NTA If his expensive tech was so important, he had many (cancelled), opportunities in the last many weeks to have gotten off his butt and picked it up!", "Meh I didn't read the whole thing lol"]}
