He had no reason to \"confess.\" At the same time, though, confronting him once about it should have been enough. There's no reason to keep hammering at it. If you can't handle it, just stop being friends with him, but it seems like your gf has things covered and can take care of herself.", "It's really inappropriate for Tommy do this while you are in a relationship with your gf.  NTA.  Pressing him was the right move - basically, you needed to warn him to back off.", "NTA- that was a weird confession and it sounds like he was trying his luck.\nOtherwise why do it? Worst case scenario (for you) she leaves you for him, best case scenario (for everyone) it creates an awkward vibe and/or affects your friendship. \n\nWhy is your GF disappointed? Did she think you should have pretended not to know?", "NTA - this Tommy is not your friend. You don\u2019t need ppl in your life that move like that. Remove Tommy from friends, make better ones. \n\nYou teach people how to treat you.

There is nothing wrong with having feelings for someone you can\u2019t date, the issue is acting on those feelings. And Tommy absolutely did act on those feelings.

Dude, you fell in the trap, by being aggressive when confronting him you come up as controlling and as you don't trust your GF, he played you, and now if you ask her to cut contact with him you'll look even more controlling, the best you can do is tell your GF that you trust her and let her decide how to handle him but you will limit your relationship with him as you feel betrayed by him going behind your back. Don't give him more ammunition.", "YTA \n\nTommy messaged your girlfriend. \n\nYour girlfriend told you. \n\nSure you can be upset. \n\nBUT you don\u2019t get to keep pressing him about this. \n\nShe does.

There are some instances where confessing that would be totally okay but doing it right after breaking up with someone makes me wonder if his crush is the reason the relationship ended.\n\nBut even if it wasn\u2019t appropriate you could have handled the situation way more maturely.

This.\n\nTommy probably didn't feel too good about telling her and made clear it was before he met his Ex.

You intervened in a private conversation that had nothing to do with you. Your gf didn't request your assistance and Tommy didn't ask her out. He confessed some uncomfortable and probably embarrassing feelings. You then went flying off the handle. That's not how a friend acts. You should've just listened to what your gf told you and then done nothing. People can't control their feelings and emotions, but they can control their actions. Tommy told your gf about his feelings, but nothing here indicates he had acted on those feelings. You on the other hand clearly lack the maturity to control your own. You took something private and embarrassing that required no action from you and made a huge stink out of it.  I question if you have the maturity to be in a relationship. 1000% YTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your GF was completely upfront with you about this. You should have discussed this with her before taking up cudgels. I'm more concerned about the impact this would have on your own relationship. If your GF thinks that you overreacted then she might be less candid the next time something like this happens. Your GF is an adult, she can make her mind up whether she had handle this herself and it would have been better if the two of you had discussed it between yourselves first.", "I think OP overstepped though and should have spoken to the gf before texting Tommy.

It required a strong response - to back off and to stop making romantic overtures to his partner.

You call Tommy's words \"not actions\", and then you call the OP's words \"actions\".  In both cases, they were conversations.  So this whole \"words ok actions not\" argument is absurd.", "Who says he didn't trust his girlfriend to handle it? But as this isn't just a random guy but supposedly a friend, this really has two sides to it. There is the advance itself, that the GF dealt with. But then there is also the legitimate question, why that guy decided to shit all over the friendship like that. I would want to know that. And likely end a friendship over a move like that. Understandable reaction. NTA", "I would agree with you if Tommy was gf's friend.  In that case contacting him would have been an overstep.  But OP has been friends with Tommy prior to knowing gf.  Tommy had acted in a way which is a betrayal to OP.  It's wild to suggest that someone isn't able to address a betrayal with a friend because that betrayal targeted your gf and not you.\n\nImagine OP had brought Tommy around and he got handsy with gf.  Gf says to back off and what, OP is not allowed to kick Tommy out without first asking gf for permission??", "Incapable of handling?  What does that even mean?  She has the choice to stick with OP or to start up a relationship with Tommy.  Either way would be \"handling\" the situation, depending upon how she felt about OP and how she felt about Tommy.  You speak as if the future is fore-ordained.  You speak as if you have no control over the outcome of your own relationship, that you can only sit back and watch what your SO will do, that you have no obligation nor need nor desire to take any actions at all to make the relationship succeed.  You speak as if, in a relationship, your pure awesomeness means you need to do nothing and your SO will just stick with you no matter what you do, just because you are so darn awesome.  That is the naive narcissist approach.  In a relationship, you really do need to show your commitment to it, you do need to show you will defend it, you do need to show you care about it.  If you do not, then your SO just might walk away with Tommy, and that is exactly what Tommy is hoping for.", "But texting her that he had a crush on her *is* acting on them. \u201cbro code\u201d use or not, the above poster is correct: a good friend does not disclose feelings to your SO.\n\nEdit: OP, NTA.", "He did act on those feelings though.

No one just randomly confesses.  That's just stupid.  He's testing the water, seeing if he should make a move.", "Ok so? If she feels the same way then OP will be rid of a girlfriend who doesn't want him anymore. It's bad, but it happens, not all relationships work. \nIt's still up to the girlfriend to respond.

I also don't get the feeling OP was worried about where she stands. \n\nBut the guys are supposed to be friends. They too share a personal relationship. And Tommy has very much violated the trust put into him as a friend. I find it very understandable to be upset about it, and feeling the need to adress it.", "When someone makes a pass at your SO, you can be sure that the SO is contemplating who is the better option.  This is not a matter of trust.  Part of that consideration is the life you have built together, how much your SO likes or loves you at that point in time, and part of it will be just how committed you are to the relationship.  If you do not show your commitment to it, by telling Tommy to back off, you are putting it at unnecessary risk.  Your SO will take note and just might move on.", "It's not nuanced, I understood it.  It's just absurd.  But that's OK.  Thanks for trying!", "No, I\u2019m not.

I think that puts them in a more negative light, than him -based on the info we have at least", "I feel like you are kinda making up your own scenario here. OP never said his GF was upset with him speaking to Tommy, only that he was \u201ctoo hostile in\u201d his reaction and that she was \u201cdisappointed\u201d. You\u2019re reading too far into it and making it about trust. We don\u2019t know what specifically she was disappointed about.

Life ain't scripted reality my dudes", "This girl is in a committed relationship and he knows it. She is not Tommy's therapist, she is not there to help him \"move on\". Tommy betrayed the trust of his friend, and needlessly put a girl who is in a committed relationship into an awkward situation.

Onision?", "I'm sorry you're so insecure in your relationships that your friends can't have confusing feelings without you immediately discount their friendship.

What other purpose could they serve?  No other purpose - it is all negative.", "Exactly. To me it says far more about their insecurities than it does about Tommy. People have confusing feelings sometimes. What harm did Tommy do getting it off his chest? If anything it let's ops gf know to not make certain jokes or comments around him. He's just letting her know of his feelings. OP took it to a place it didn't need to go.", "Her and Tommy's. These perspectives are the only ones that are really of importance.

He felt threatened, he went full offense and is now wondering why is gf is disappointed in him. Well, duh - he misused the trust put into her.\n\nThe world isn't half as hostile as you make it out to be - and I am a pessimistic person telling you this.", "U-hu.\n\nMoving goalposts, aren't we?", "Yeah. I still disagree. I think he has a right to talk to his friend.", "Most people will betray a friend if it might result in a relationship with someone they admire, someone for which they have a \"crush\".  This is just reality.  Only very close friends might hesitate.  \"might\" hesitate - even a close friend might decide it's worth going for it.\n\nUnfortunately, your buddy learned the hard way, and who knows, maybe if he had stepped in confidently, things might have turned out differently.\n\nAnd in this story, Tommy already betrayed his friend, OP, by testing OP's relationship.\n\n\"we all betray that trust at some point\" - yes, and most friendships come and go.  Including most long-lasting friendships.", "You certainly can't deal with someone disagreeing with you, huh", "You jump to conclusions about the girlfriend despite OP not writing a single word about how she handles it - as he doesn't know. Didn't even care, wanna bet?", "I'm not talking about the world, and I'm not talking about hostility, I'm talking about the appropriate actions to take in such a situation, which happen to align with what OP chose to do.", "No, \"getting something off the chest\" is an expression, it's not an actual reason.  Neither is being an adult, you just \"are\" an adult, it's not a reason either.  None of the things you listed are actual reasons.  Seriously.  Why don't you just put \"what the hell, just wanted to spout my mouth off that day\" as a reason too.  Or \"sometimes I just say things without thinking\" as another reason."]}
