{"id": 29758, "submission_id": "17hfty6", "title": "AITA for wanting to name my baby instead of SIL?", "selftext": "Throwaway for privacy reasons. I (28F) am 5 months pregnant with my first baby with my husband (31M). Both sides of the family are really happy with the news since it's the first grandbaby of the family. Things have been rough on me, with sickness, body aches and emotions being in high gear lately.\n\nYesterday, my SIL (25F) came over with MIL (50F) to give us some gifts. They're family heirlooms for the baby, that were at my husband's grandmother's home. We were all talking and having a good laugh when the topic of naming the baby came up, and my SIL beamed up and said \"She can't wait to name that cutie pie!\".\n\nThis kinda took me aback. I do know, that in my husband's culture, it's the paternal aunt who names the child, but I just find it kinda odd. I'll agree that the perfect names can come out of nowhere, even my name was given to me by my late great-grandmother but the final call was my parents'.\n\nI asked SIL if she had thought of any names, and well the names she said, are not something I want for my baby for personal reasons. I told SIL \"I don't like the names\", to which MIL kinda gave me a stink eye and said, \"Those are really beautiful names, hubby and you should think about them, considering this name will stay with your baby forever\" ( even more the reason why I don't want the names ). SIL got a bit defensive and told me that she researched it from the internet and they were the prettiest names she found, to which I said \"They're pretty but not something that'd go well with the last name ( we're hyphenating the baby's name with my maiden name and hubby's last name ). I think at this point a passive-aggressive argument started, for about 15 minutes until Hubby came back.\n\nHubby and I talked after they left and he agreed that we should be the ones to decide the baby's name, but my reaction to the suggestion and the argument was just a bit harsh. AITA?\n\nEdit #1: Somebody in my DMs pointed out that I should mention this in the post.\n\n1. The names SIL chose are beautiful, but unfortunately, there is some history related to them. She told me two names, one for a girl and one for a boy. The girl's name is the same as my ex-girlfriend from high school through my first year of college, who cheated on me. She was my first love and I don't want a constant reminder of her, whenever I see my baby.\n\n2. The history behind the boy's name is darker. You see when MIL was pregnant with SIL, she was supposed to have another baby. She gave birth to two babies, but sadly baby #2, a boy did not make it through. The name they were supposed to give to that boy sounds eerily similar to the baby name SIL suggested, which only creeps me out, not to mention, that it's a bit of a bad omen IMO.\n\n3. One of the reasons behind MIL's reaction as one of you pointed out has to do with the fact of how much MIL dotes on SIL. She is the miracle golden child of the family, who made it and got into medicine, which is super tough to crack in my country. Though MIL has never done anything horrendous against my husband or me, it is clear that she has a favorite child, who can do no wrong.\n\nEdit #2: Bit of an update, I called her up today, asking if we can meet. She is leaving day after tomorrow for college, so we'll meet tomorrow to talk this face-to-face. As for MIL and extd. family, there's a bit of drama going on apparently in the group chat, over the baby's name. Idk what is exactly wrong. I'll know once I open the gc.\n\nSince a lot of you are asking, the naming ritual is from the Indian Culture. My husband and I are both from India but from different regions. The region where I come from has no naming ritual of sorts, but in my husband's culture, a ceremony is done 2 weeks after the baby's birth, where the paternal aunt names the baby. \n\n", "created_utc": 1698382286, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17hfty6/aita_for_wanting_to_name_my_baby_instead_of_sil/", "score": 312, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
