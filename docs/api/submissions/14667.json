After graduating college he decided that he would live at home until he could buy a house. Despite the recent US market changes and being in a HCOL area, he remained determined, and recently accumulated a down payment and prequalified for a loan.\n\nI have worked in some capacity of the residential remodeling industry for my entire adult life, so my wife told me she assumed that I would need to help him with whatever he bought because it probably \u201cneeded to be fixed\u201d since most properties in his price range were in pretty rough shape. I told her I am happy to lend a hand here and there with small items, or give him advice, but that I will not blindly agree to any work when he hasn\u2019t even bought anything and when it\u2019s as vague as \u201cneeds to be fixed.\u201d My wife was not thrilled with my response but dropped the issue and I didn\u2019t hear anything about Mason\u2019s house hunt for a few weeks.\n\nLast week, my wife announced that Mason had closed on a property a few towns over. She went over with her mom and sisters on a weekday to check it out while I was at work. When I got home she showed me some photos and as I suspected, the house is rough. She once again stated that I would need to help Mason out because \u201che didn\u2019t know where to start\u201d and \u201che\u2019s low on money after buying the house.\u201d I tried, as politely as I could, to explain that the house needed far more time and money than anyone in her family realized, and that I work 50 hours per week, we have two young children, property with livestock, and a 70 year old house that I am already working on in my tiny amount of free time. I cannot take on a full remodel, for free, 45 minutes away.\n\nA couple of days later, my wife said that we would be going to Mason\u2019s on Saturday for a work party. I reluctantly packed some tools and drove the family out there. My wife\u2019s parents, two sisters, and their husbands were there. No one in the group has any construction experience, I\u2019m pretty sure most of them have never even touched a power tool, and it quickly became clear that there was no plan and everyone was looking at me for direction. We fumbled through the day, everyone using my tools to pull up carpet or remove a medicine cabinet or take down paneling. Mason had no vision for what he wanted and no new materials on site, and even asked me to go to the bigbox store on my way home to \u201cget whatever we need for next time.\u201d\n\nThat night I said again that Mason is in way over his head and that there is no way a few Saturdays of work will make a dent. I think my wife understands that now, but my in-laws and wife\u2019s sisters are VERY upset and calling me the AH because I\u2019m not willing to help more. I told them I cannot do this every weekend, especially for free, and Mason needs to figure this out. Their response is that Mason has been counting on me for help ever since he started looking, and I need to give him a hand because he\u2019s family.

He never even asked if you would be able to help him once he bought it.\n\nHe should get some estimates on how much it will cost to get the work needed done. Maybe all these people complaining about you will contribute money for his renovation since they are so generous. Also, you have plenty of work at home.

That\u2019s hella rude, but the assumption that you\u2019d do all that for nothing (and prob pay for supplies) is just boggling. \n\nIt\u2019s gonna be a long term project for him and he can utilize YouTube if he wants to do it himself. He bought a fixer upper and it\u2019s his to deal with.", "NTA. Your wife\u2019s entire family sound like entitled AHs. If he needs your help, he should have reached out to you and told you so.

The whole time he was looking for a house he was under the assumption you would basically do a free remodel? Your wife and her whole family are TA, certainly not you after making your stance clear to her. Now he\u2019s in a pit with no help and everyone is trying to blame you. Not cool. If he went in with eyes wide open then I\u2019m sure he would\u2019ve gone about his home purchase differently.

At least your wife realized his request is unrealistic.", "NTA. While I think it's a good thing for family members to help each other out to a reasonable amount if they have expertise in a specific field, it's not some kind of blank check on that person's time. I'm sure there are tons of people who face this dilemma regularly when family members start over-asking for help. Think IT workers, any tradecraft, veterinarians, hair dressers, massage therapists, etc.\n\nBut this is a potential minefield that can cause hard feelings.

Please have the building supplies ready to go though.\"\n\nIf he doesn't know what he needs, then you could say \"I'll take a look and make a list for you, or do some shopping,  but that will likely use up all the free time that I have for this month so I won't be able to help actually do the project.\"", "NTA. Nobody is entitled to free labor from you. It sounds like Mason himself didn't even ask you for help, he just assumed you would handle the remodel of his entire house, for free. The entitlement here is absurd.\n\nIt sounds like Mason has been coddled by his family and now they're mad because you're not falling over yourself trying to protect him from himself. Tough. Mason is a grown man and needs to learn how to figure his shit out for himself.\n\nAnd your wife is the AH too. She should have had your back from the beginning and told her family that you aren't able to help. It might have even helped you avoid this whole mess.", "NTA. Sounds like they basically want you to redo his entire house.\n\nI'd tell him to figure things out himself using online resources (it's amazing the stuff you can learn online) and that if he has any specific questions you'll be happy to give him some advice.", "NTA your wife\u2019s family is for encouraging him to buy something that wasn\u2019t move in ready and for volunteering you without asking to remodel his house (FOR FREE)", "NTA. Your boundaries are fair. Mason should be empowered to solve his own problems, ask for help, negotiate with others, etc. You are not responsible for his choices. \n\nThat being said, it's a tricky thing to communicate to people who aren't valuing your time, effort, and expertise. There are some pitfalls there. Try to stake your boundaries calmly and directly (instead of in anger - I'm not saying you are, it would just be an understandable response in this situation).", "Most homeowners can hardly keep up with one house! I can\u2019t believe they think you have time for two. Something has to give, and I\u2019m not sure what the think you should take off your plate to take on Mason\u2019s projects.\n\nThe best advice is to Slow down if he just closed and has no experience with handiwork.

We just ripped up carpets and hired a floor sander and polished the boards and repainted the walls. We lived there for years very slowly remodelling a bit at a time. On occasions our uncle would pop in and give us a hand. He spent an afternoon showing my partner how to tile the bathroom. My partner did the rest. We could only afford a box of tiles a week on our wages so the bathroom took a year. Honestly it was the most fun we ever had on a house and we\u2019ve renovated many since that time. In fact my partner went on to become a professional bathroom renovater. \nNow people expect my partner to renovate their places.
