It\u2019s probably more about her resentment towards bio dad than how it would make step dad feel.", "Take them both. You are a lucky woman. And they are also lucky. NTA.", "NTA, your mom is WAY out of line!", "Your wedding, you can do it however you want. If they are both willing.", "NTA. \n\nMy BFF did this as well. It was a beautiful moment", "NTA. The only people who matter in this are you, your fiance, your stepdad, and your dad. It's a lovely gesture.", "NTA. Sounds like your mom is still carrying some guilt about getting knocked up young, and projecting that onto Harry. \"Deadbeat\" is a really unfair way to refer to a man who was imprisoned, and then got back into his kid's life once he was back on his feet and able to. Hard to believe she didn't know what sort of young man she had chosen to involve herself with, and her partner being imprisoned is an entirely predictable consequence of that choice.", "I agree but at the same time, by going to prison, Harry left mom, a teen mom, to raise a child on her own. She did (with eventual help from Ray) not only while Harry was in prison, but for another ~7-8 years while he got his life together. So 14 years. She\u2019s allowed to not forgive Harry for that, and seeing him get credit the same as the man who did step up, and also much more credit than she got as a single mom, because he came around after many many years. \n\nWhy can\u2019t mom walk her daughter down the aisle? The person who was there 100% of the time. Not only when Harry was in prison but while he got to pretend he didn\u2019t have a child so he could have a better life. \n\nIt\u2019s OPs choice, but honestly I think mom has the right to be upset because not only did Harry spend 8 years in prison and then CHOOSE to not be a dad for an additional ~7 years, he also put the entire parenting load on her shoulders alone, which Ray graciously helped her with.", "Being a mother (and parent) is a lot of putting your own desires aside to do what\u2019s best for your child. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s not what she wants, her child who has 2 dads is getting married and wants both to be her dads. \n\nMom lacks the maturity it seems to act like a mom. Both dads act like dads who just want their kid happy.", "Nah, her child has a dad and a guy who skipped 14 years out of CHOICE.", "Nta. Your mom is terrible. It's a shame that ray, a seemingly super cool dude wound up with her.", "NTA it's your wedding, it's your choice who walks you down the isle. Ray and Harry can either walk you down together or whoever throws a fit gets cut. You could have Ray walk you halfway down to represent the first half of your life and have Harry join to symbolize your relationship growing from then on. Up to you", "NTA - that is a wonderful thing to do, it sounds like you have two pretty great dads in your life.\n\nYour mom is still bitter about how Harry managed to screw up her life when she was young.  Listen to what your dads say, they are the ones who will tell you how they feel.", "NTA ... one of the sweetest moments I have seen at a wedding was a step father walking the bride to a certain spot, and handing her to her birth father to finish the walk down the aisle to her future spouse.\n\nWas an excellent and touching moment that was respectful and inclusive.", "NTA - Your mom is bringing her own bullshit into this. Don't let her. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCongrats on your marriage and the two amazing father figures in your life. I am so glad you have Ray and you perfectly explained to him his importance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you really want to be sure you are being considerate of Ray then just in the course of your lives reinforce his importance to you. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSeriously congrats!", "Harry brought you into the world; Ray brought you up in the world. They\u2019re both good with the idea, so go with it. Your mom is worried about nothing.", "NTA My dad was always in the picture. I met my stepdad when I was 9 (he married my mom when I was 10). Both of my dads provided me with love and support. When I got engaged I never thought for a minute that they wouldn't both be walking me down the aisle. Ignore your mom, it's your wedding not hers.", "NTA. You are very sweet to include them both.", "Nta", "Agree with what others have said, this is a lovely idea, sorry your Mom is struggling with it. At this point, if you gave in to her, you'd have to uninvite your bio Dad to walk with you, and that would be so hurtful for him. Maybe that can be a way to help your Mom accept this, that you aren't willing to uninvite him?", "Which isle? Maui? St. Croix? Crete? The Isle of Man? Oshima?", "I think having both Ray and Harry walk you down the aisle would be beautiful. Congratulations and best wishes on your upcoming wedding!  <3", "This!  If you don't want to have a baby in highschool, don't do baby-making things!  \n\nSame goes for jail...", "NTA - it\u2019s your day and you should so what\u2019s best for you!\n\nHowever, as an adult, I have a lot of empathy for your mom. You\u2019ve gotten an opportunity to get to know this new man, while your mom sees the man who left her alone as a teen mom, only to re-emerge when a lot of the hard parts of difficulty parenting were done. \n\n**Your day shouldn\u2019t be effected by that**, however I can understand an empathize with her. She is misdirecting her energy though.", "Your mother clearly loves Ray and hates Harry for obvious reasons and I don't blame her. She can no longer perceive Harry from a place of love or understanding so she will not be okay with him walking you down. Since you are looking at things from a more objective position, talk to your mother again and be kind in explaining your decision to her. If you can, talk to Ray too to let your mother know that He is fine with your decision. But please understand that she's probably speaking from a place of pain so be gentle.", "NTA Congratulations \ud83c\udf89 and your Mom isn't getting married, you and your future spouse are. I think it's a wonderful gesture, and BTW I've seen this before.", "NTA. Ray is a great father great enough to want your happiness over any solo honor. Tell your mother everyone is on board and she can either get on board or choose not to attend her choice. Either way they will both be walking you down the isle.", "NTA. By the way, aisle not isle.", "If you, Ray, and Harry are happy with it, that's all that matters. Your mom's opinion is irrelevant and likely based on her own issues with your biological dad.\n\nBut, it's not her call. You're not the asshole.", "NTA\n\nWhile your mom is entitled to her opinion, it's just that, HER opinion. She clearly has some trauma around your biodad, I'm guessing she didn't care to get to know his reformed side, so she's biased and angry.\n\nWhat matters is that both your dads said they'd be proud to stand beside you, together. You have two supporting dads who are big enough to share that role in your life. That's the most important thing. Not that your mom has some opinions about biodad.", "Her child has 2 dads. \n\nBoth of whom she sees as her dads, both of whom treat her like their daughter, and are happy for her to have 2 dads.", "NTA \n\nHarry and Ray are both happy to do it. It sounds like your mother has some unresolved bitterness towards Ray, which is understandable, but she needs to back down. It's YOUR wedding, not your mother's, and if you want both your dads and they're cool with it, her opinion ultimately doesn't matter.", "NTA. Harry has put in over a decade to repair your relationship. Ray respects that and says he's happy to share the moment. Ray raised you well, and Harry has genuinely tried to fix things.", "Nope. It\u2019s your day, and if they both played a big role in your life they should respect your choice.", "NTA.\n\nYour mother needs to work through her own feelings about Harry, and not project them onto you.\n\nI hope your wedding is everything you want it to be.", "NTA. Your mom is dealing with her own issues. Try not to think badly of her.", "NTA. \n\nHarry and Ray are both your fathers. One without whom you wouldn't exist, and the other without whom you wouldn't be in a good place today; had he not stepped up. If anything I would say Ray is more of a father to you because he has essentially taken the responsibility of raising you - and he's happy only if you are. But it doesn't change the fact that Harry is, in fact; your dad.\n\nNow I can understand where your mum's feelings are stemming from, she was just a vulnerable teenager knocked up by a guy who promptly went to jail after, leaving her to fend for herself. Guess who was a beacon of light to her in those dark times? Ray. She hasn't dealt with those feelings yet and I don't think she is inherently the AH for wanting to protect you - she feels Harry could abandon you too. But what she needs to realise is that he is no longer the same guy with no control over his life. The fact that he's done a 180 and even cried at the thought of being honored by walking you down the aisle, shows his heart is in the right place. If I was you I would just be glad my bio dad returned. So many people don't get that privilege. \n\nDon't let your mum gaslight you into thinking you're disrespecting Ray. From what I understand Ray himself is ok with the idea so why is your mum ASSUMING his feelings? If anything this is a convo you need to be having with him. Ask Ray point blank if this makes him uncomfortable. And if he confirms he's on board with the idea, then tell your mum to back off and stop being his mouthpiece. You're already being so accommodating and treating both your dads equally. This is not a competition. Neither does it have to be the way your mom imagined it in her head, this is YOUR wedding; you get to decide how it goes. Wish you all the best for your big day, and wishing you a happy married life <3", "NTA\nSince both Ray and Harry are on board with this idea, your mother can go and kiss your butt OP. \n\nCongratulations \ud83c\udf89", "NTA - both Ray and Harry are happy, so your mum can butt out.", "You do what YOU want! If you want them to both walk you down the aisle, then that's what you should do! I don't get on very well with my mother, and haven't seen my dad for more than 20yrs, so I had my daughter walk me down the aisle. She was also my bridesmaid, my husbands best man and she 'gave me away'. We did what WE wanted to do for our day, and it was so calm and a really enjoyable day!", "Aw. I think it's really sweet and appropriate that you'll be dancing with both of them, and that \"The\" father/daughter dance will be with Ray. Hopefully that formal and public acknowledgement of your dad-by-choice's role in your life will help your mom realize that you have no intention of displacing him. As others have said, your mom is projecting her understandable issues with Harry onto you. Maybe if you keep assuring Ray he's your number one dad he can help her come around.   \n\n\nEdited because I didn't vote: NAH. You are definitely N T A, your mom is acting like T A, but I kind of get why she is.", "YWNBTA.  Mom needs to set her feelings aside and allow the two men involved to show their respect for each other and their love for you by getting along on this important day.  Remind her in this day of broken marriages and blended families this is not an unusual situation, but it is rare to find both a bio and step parent willing to behave like adults and put the child first.  Both the men are willing to be cooperative, do what you want and tell mom to chill.", "NAH\n\nIf you have any doubts just double check with Ray. And ask your mom if she has any other problems with Harry being there to walk you down the aisle.", "NTA\n\nOther than you, the only people who are involved & get to have an impactful opinion are Ray & your biological dad. They both sound like great guys who have your happiness in mind. As long as the three of you are happy with the walk down the aisle, go for it. I hope you all have a great time during the walk & that you have a great wedding & an even better marriage.", "NTA Ray is on your side no matter what he has shown that your mom is projecting her feelings toward Harry onto you and Ray. It\u2019s your day be that princess who has a dad on each side!! Congrats BTW", "Your first paragraph is just a massive drama seeking escalation.", "Honestly idk why everyone downvoted you, i guess this is reddit. They see minor disagreement which can be resolved with a good conversation and advice things like 'go NC!!!' I disagree with you, i think bio dad should have that chance as a step dad too, (edit: i also think OP is NTA, but these commenters are AHs sometimes). It's funny how everyone jumped to condemn the mom who raised OP alone and, first of all, gave OP life. Childbirth is very painful process ya know, to make money and bring food to the table while being a single mom is painful too. Don't ever try to waste your time and argue with them spoiled little kids, their hive mind will never respect women and mothers enough.", "NTA \n\ntheir cool with it and it's your wedding so do what you want and what will make you happy. you don't wanna look back on your wedding day with regrets.", "Absolutely NTA. Your wedding, your choice. Especially if your bio dad and your dad are on board with it.", "you are not an asshole you handled them both well and they are both honoured.  \n\nyou\u2019re mom will have a bias and there is a good chance that your mom has kept certain issues away from you. like child support etc that maybe your father wasn\u2019t able to pay etc.   there are hidden problems that parents should and do keep from their kids when they are separated.  so just remember your mom may not be entirely unreasonable with how she feels. if address it with her and see if there are some unresolved issues or resentment she has and then let her know that those are separate from your relationship with either one of them", "Nta. If they\u2019re both fine with it, why does her opinion matter here? You\u2019ve talked with both dads and they\u2019re into it, so go for it.", "NTA \n\nRay doesn\u2019t have a problem with it himself, the only one who doesn\u2019t like it is your mom", "You are a kind person. I am a mom with a ex who hasn\u2019t been the best father. They also have an excellent stepdad. \n\nI told the kids if they get married, it would be best to have the groom/bride meet them at the beginning of the walk so they can do that together. No fights that way. \n\nLet your mom have her selfish reaction. Call her again and remind her why you want both. He was there for you from 14 onwards. He is not a deadbeat. Get on board or get out of the way. \n\nNta", "NTA This is your wedding, you can make whatever choices you want. Your mom has absolutely no say in the decisions you make, regardless of if she agrees with them or not.", "That\u2019s so sweet!", "Sure Mom has a right to be upset, but she doesn\u2019t have a right to put that on her daughter.\n\nFor the past 20 years I\u2019ve raised my kids predominantly on my own since they were babies with little helpful input from their father. Ten years ago he moved overseas and left me to it. Since then my son has mostly been NC with him and my daughter has been LC.\n\nIf my daughter has anyone walk her down the aisle I would expect it to be me.\n\nIf she told me she had asked her father to do it I would be hurt. But I wouldn\u2019t make a fuss or try and make her feel bad about it because it\u2019s not about me. \nMom is not entitled to anything in this scenario because it\u2019s not her wedding.\n\nNTA"]}
