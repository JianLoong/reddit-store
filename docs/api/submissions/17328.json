Wedding planning has been going great so far, except for one small hiccup. \n\nSee, my stepdad (who I\u2019ll call Ray for simplicity) was the one who raised me. My bio dad (Harry) was a teen dad (my mom was also a teen mom for the record) who got arrested right out of highschool when I was six months old. Drug charges and tax fraud, I think. He got eight years. When I was four, my mom met Ray and they eventually got married. \n\nFrom day one, Ray treated me like his own daughter. He was kind, caring, thoughtful, and so attentive to my needs.

When I was about six, I started calling Ray \u201cdad\u201d. \n\nWhen I was fourteen, I was contacted by Harry (through my mom). To my surprise, he\u2019d actually turned his life around. He\u2019d gotten a vocational qualification and was working a good job, and decided to reach out and get to know me.

The only one who had a problem with my decision was my mom, who found out when I casually told her. \n\nShe said that it was disrespectful to Ray, who had been there my whole childhood, to give Harry (who she called a deadbeat) the same honor as the man who raised me since I was little. \n\nHer words have me doubting myself, and the last thing I want to do is disrespect Ray.

As you said, Ray is your no. 1, and he knows that. He is happy for you, as is your biological dad.\n\nI fear your mum simply dislikes your bio dad and of course, loves her husband therefore doesn't think it's fair but she isn't seeing it from your perspective.\n\nFurther to that- it's your wedding and your choice.

That is all that matters. Your dad unlike some people, actually did manage to turn his life around, and be there for you(even if it was later on in your life).

It's great you have two good father figures in your life, and I'm super happy for you ! Your mother is definitely the AH. She doesn't have to project her feelings on your life. From what you wrote I assume she have a complicated relationship with Harry, maybe she felt abandonned when he was sent to jail, leaving her with a kid, but that has nothing to do with you. You have mend your own relationship with Harry, while still having a great one with Ray, which is extraordinary and awesome, and it has nothing to do with her. It's also your wedding and you choose who you want to be with. Maybe talking with Ray, so that he can explain to her he thinks that's great, would be useful ?

Thanks to him, yes, she had a harder time.  But she could have waited and choose another guy to have sex with and then avoided the whole situation.  Your father and step-father - bonus dad - both love you and both are trying to make this a positive event for you.  Not sure why your mother chooses to have a negative reaction other than she is ticked at your dad and this is her way of trying to get back at him for being irresponsible as a teen (but in fairness - most are).  That is not appropriate to do to you at all.  She needs to address her bitterness on her own directly to him.", "NTA. Your dads don't care and are ok.

I understand that my bio-father hurt you by not stepping up but he has turned his life around has/is proving himself daily.\"", "NTA, Ray doesn\u2019t have a problem with it, and Harry turned his life around and bonded.

You, Ray, and Harry. You went about this in a respectful manner by talking to them both. If all 3 of you are good with the arrangement, then thats all that matters. End of story. NTA.", "NTA.  My niece actually did JUST that at her wedding.  Her mom could have done it as well as we had both a dad and a stepdad, but she solved that issue in a much simpler way.  She asked ME to walk her down the aisle, which I did.  A little off topic, but reading this story just reminded me of a good memory I felt the need to share.  But if both your bio dad and your dad are okay with it then your mom really has no ground to stand on.  It looks to me like Ray is putting your happiness before any discomfort he may have (Not that he's having them, just saying) which is what a good dad does.", "NTA\n\nHarry is a significant part of your life, no matter what your mother thinks. Ray sounds like an amazing man. It\u2019s your special day. Do what you feel in your heart is best.", "NTA\n\nBut I\u2019m not going to lie to you like the other commenters and say you talked to both dads and yada yada and everyone was fine. Mom came at you upset for a reason maybe it was nothing maybe it wasn\u2019t. I\u2019ll say this though the man you described to be Ray would definitely not tell you if his feelings were hurt but he might confide in his wife. Your NTA cuz it\u2019s your wedding your choice but I personally felt how your mom did about it when I read it. I see it as a slap in the face to Ray for all he did by putting them on equal footing on such an important life milestone. Again that\u2019s just me and how I feel about it, still doesn\u2019t make you an ah. No one really is or isn\u2019t right in this it\u2019s simply different perspectives. Your mom is defending her husband against the boy who let her down, so obviously her view is going to be bias. You simply see your dads.", "Keep in mind your mum is also a victim of Harry\u2019s decisions. Be gentle with her too. NAH", "NTA\nyour wedding,  your choice.\nI think it is BEAUTIFUL that your bio dad turned his life around and you want to honor both men. You've got 2 great dads, when many don't have any.\nMom's probably struggling with her own feelings about bio dad and their relationship. hopefully she can put this aside and focus on your happiness.", "Nta. I plan to do the same thing. And it's not about honor it's about love. And being emotionally evolved and mature.", "NTA\n\nThe fact that both dads are on board proves that this is one situation where your mom's opinion doesn't matter.\n\nYOU are the only one that can define how important people are to you and that includes your parents/people who raised you. You have decided that both of these men are worthy of the honour and both of them graciously received the request that way. To change now would only hurt one or both of them based on the opinion of someone who's not even involved in the conversation!", "Absolutely not. I was the bio-dad in the three way walk down the aisle. I wouldn\u2019t have had it any other way.", "NTA. You\u2019re not disrespecting anybody. If anything you\u2019re honouring your relationship with both. You\u2019re not doing anything to spite anyone but your mom cannot see past who your biological father was as opposed to who he is now.", "NTA. Neither of the men involved nor you have a problem with it, so this is a problem your mom has that she needs to figure out.", "NTA, you handled the situation with both dad's very nicely. I think it's so lovely of you to want both of them to walk you down the aisle. Your mum will just have to get it together and act like an adult. Best of luck with the wedding btw.", "NTA - your mom (probably rightfully) still holds a lot of resentment against Harry, which is entirely understandable but she needs to keep in mind that said resentment is HER problem. Your relationship with your dads is your own - not hers. \n\nHonestly, it sounds like Ray is really secure in your guys relationship - he KNOWS that he's the man who raised you for the majority of your childhood. He knows the work he put in and he's proud of the relationship you guys have. I'm not entirely sure why your own mother is now offended on Ray's behalf that you've ALSO built a relationship with Harry, but again, that's a HER problem.", "I agree with QuinGood.  \n\nI also think the mother is holding resentment to the father for leaving her pregnant and then getting  put away I'm jail. \n\nThis is OP's wedding and as long as her bio dad and her dad by choice is good with it... Then mom has no say really.", "Yeah what it boils down to is she needs to respect you and your authority and mind her own business, just a question of how politely/directly you communicate that to her", "She definitely resents him for not being there to help raise me, I think she just wants to forget he ever existed and pretend Ray is my only dad.", "I hope your mom is able to put aside her differences and you have a wonderful wedding.", "Well, that isn't her choice and it's not fair put this on you. Her resentment is hers to deal with, not yours. You build a relationship with your bio father and you want him to walk you with your dad and that ALL that matters. Don't let her make your day about her."]}
