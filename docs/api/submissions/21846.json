We're only about 6 weeks away from the due date, so I'm in full-on get shit done mode.\n\nMy wife has also been having it out with her mother recently and they're not on the greatest of terms right now.  Her mother has this neat way of flipping every situation into being about her and her feelings, no matter how far away she actually is removed from whatever said situation is.  My wife has gotten to the point where she's done playing therapist to her mother, and is just giving her thoughts and opinions (when asked) straight with no sugar coating.  It's been going about as well as you'd expect, but I stand behind my wife fully as I'm also tired of the BS.\n\nSo yesterday afternoon, just as I'm about to lay down some new flooring I hear some car doors slam outside and our dog starts loosing her mind.  Great.  I see through a window that it's my in-laws walking up the driveway and go to tell my wife.  She had no idea that they were stopping by, and we both HATE it when people drop in without giving us a good 30 minute warning, especially if they expect to come in.  We've expressed this many times to them in the past.\n\nAnyway, MIL knocks and lets herself in, asking if we're decent.  I'm commando in basketball shorts and a very sweaty T-shirt, so I reply with a nope.  My very pregnant wife is still scrambling to get dressed at this point, and my FIL is standing just outside on the porch looking like he doesn't want to be there (typical).  MIL starts asking all cheerily if they can come in and see the progress we're making, completely ignoring that she's been saying some very unpleasant things to my wife lately.\n\nI tell her no, I'm right in the middle of doing stuff, I don't have time to be giving tours, and neither of us are dressed for company.  I think she thinks I'm joking, as I've been know to have a dry sense of humor and she's use to getting her way, but I stand firm that this is not a good time.  They both leave and head back to their truck with stunned looks on their faces, my wife shooting me a mild stink-eye in the process and goes off after them.\n\nSo my wife is outside talking to them for a few minutes and then they drive off.  My wife comes back in stressing that I may have just made the beef between her and her mother worse, and that her step-dad feels snubbed because he wanted to help me with whatever it was I was working on.  Neither one of us believe that he wanted to help one little bit, that was just her mother's in for coming over, but either way they should have called first.\n\nMy wife, however, was pleased that I was able to set a firm boundary with them, and generally agrees with everything I did.  I would have done the same thing with my own parents, even though I know I'd never have to as they respect our space and know how a phone works.
