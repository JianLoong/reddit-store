We're only about 6 weeks away from the due date, so I'm in full-on get shit done mode.\n\nMy wife has also been having it out with her mother recently and they're not on the greatest of terms right now.  Her mother has this neat way of flipping every situation into being about her and her feelings, no matter how far away she actually is removed from whatever said situation is.  My wife has gotten to the point where she's done playing therapist to her mother, and is just giving her thoughts and opinions (when asked) straight with no sugar coating.  It's been going about as well as you'd expect, but I stand behind my wife fully as I'm also tired of the BS.\n\nSo yesterday afternoon, just as I'm about to lay down some new flooring I hear some car doors slam outside and our dog starts loosing her mind.  Great.  I see through a window that it's my in-laws walking up the driveway and go to tell my wife.  She had no idea that they were stopping by, and we both HATE it when people drop in without giving us a good 30 minute warning, especially if they expect to come in.  We've expressed this many times to them in the past.\n\nAnyway, MIL knocks and lets herself in, asking if we're decent.  I'm commando in basketball shorts and a very sweaty T-shirt, so I reply with a nope.  My very pregnant wife is still scrambling to get dressed at this point, and my FIL is standing just outside on the porch looking like he doesn't want to be there (typical).  MIL starts asking all cheerily if they can come in and see the progress we're making, completely ignoring that she's been saying some very unpleasant things to my wife lately.\n\nI tell her no, I'm right in the middle of doing stuff, I don't have time to be giving tours, and neither of us are dressed for company.  I think she thinks I'm joking, as I've been know to have a dry sense of humor and she's use to getting her way, but I stand firm that this is not a good time.  They both leave and head back to their truck with stunned looks on their faces, my wife shooting me a mild stink-eye in the process and goes off after them.\n\nSo my wife is outside talking to them for a few minutes and then they drive off.  My wife comes back in stressing that I may have just made the beef between her and her mother worse, and that her step-dad feels snubbed because he wanted to help me with whatever it was I was working on.  Neither one of us believe that he wanted to help one little bit, that was just her mother's in for coming over, but either way they should have called first.\n\nMy wife, however, was pleased that I was able to set a firm boundary with them, and generally agrees with everything I did.  I would have done the same thing with my own parents, even though I know I'd never have to as they respect our space and know how a phone works.

Seems to be a theme for those who love making everything about them.", "NTA  \nWho does a surprise visit to a heavily pregnat couple while they are flipping the floor on their house?", "NTA. Sometimes you have to be a dick to get you point across. Especially with people who trample boundaries.", "NTA. Why are doors not locked? So many posts about people just walking in! Do front doors not lock when closed? If I pull my door closed without my key I\u2019m screwed.", "NTA.  You're preparing for a baby to come.  The least they could've done was called.  It's called common courtesy.  Something a lot of people are missing these days.  They are just entitled brats, thinking it's their daughter & they don't need an invite or to call ahead.  You set the boundaries & now maybe MIL will get the hint, or things will be worse.  Who knows?  The fact is, you've done nothing wrong.", "As anyone who has parented a toddler knows, when you start saying no it gets worse before it gets better. Keep up the good work. NTA.", "NTA.\n\nIt is in no way unreasonable or rude to request a heads up before someone shows up.\n\nHere's a story about my experiences with my MIL. She would randomly show up at our door, claiming to have \"just been in the neighbourhood\". The claim didn't hold any truth as they live 45 mins away and she'd have freshly baked banana bread with (this happened multiple times). At any point during making the banana bread, baking it, and/or driving in our direction, she could have easily called or texted, but never did. Often times we'd be out and my husband would feel the need to cut our activities short when his mother would call because she was outside our place and we weren't home. He insisted \"it's just how his family is\" and I needed to accept it. My compromise was that if he wanted to drop everything he could, but I would continue doing whatever I was already doing and not play host to uninvited and unannounced guests. The first time she showed up, I was in the middle of meal prep, so I just kept doing that, with my music blasting. When he realized I really wasn't going to stop and come say hi and help entertain, suddenly it stopped happening. \n\nStay firm on the boundary, as this is likely to get worse when there's a newborn. (MIL will likely come over to \"help\" by offering to hold baby instead of helping by doing something useful like offering to fold laundry, wash the dishes, etc.)", "Small-town Canada living, if we're home during the day the door we use most isn't locked.", "Time to get into the habit of locking it.", "Get a keypad door lock. That way you remove the need for a key if you're in and out. Also, in case you ever actually need to give someone access, you can set them up with a temp code that only works when activated. It'll also give you a log of when it's used (and typically also if it's attempted to be used when it's deactivated, so you can see if other crap is going on). Highly recommend.", " NTA. It\u2019s best to get this straight with them now before the baby comes. They can\u2019t drop in on a whim when you have a sleeping baby.", "NTA nor is your wife even if she's a bit of a doormat change the locks and DON'T GIVE MIL A KEY AGAIN FFS.\n\nAlso as of now if they don't call before you don't answer and they need to leave. You and your wife didn't yet put enough boundaries up not reinforce them.\n\nThink whats gonna happen when the baby is there:do you want Mil to barge in on you whenever she feels like it? Wake you or the baby up cause she wants to visit and doesn't bother to ask?! \n\nPut your foot down the both of you, now before your baby comes or you ll regret it.", "NTA", "NTA. I'd be enraged. They KNOW your feelings on surprise visits and are fully aware of the state of the mother/daughter relationship, yet they chose to concoct some half-assed story for a drop-by. It is beyond rude and inconsiderate.   \n\n\nUnfortunately, I fear it'll only get worse after the baby comes along. Keep setting those boundaries now, and lock your doors.", "NTA\n\nNext time they might call ahead.", "NTA\n\nGood to put this boundary in place before the baby gets here and MIL moves in.", "NTA. Anyone who\u2019s done a home project knows that dropping by randomly and offering help is going to be a disruption. This offer of help is complete nonsense. Even if they were completely sincere, it\u2019s really unwelcome and you did the right thing.", "\"Anyway, MIL knocks and lets herself in, asking if we're decent\". And what would she have done if you'd still been naked in bed? Or in the shower? Coming over without calling - rude. Walking straight into your house - rude. Saying nasty things to your wife and then blowing in all sunshine and rainbows - rude. NTA, and good for you for running her off. Once the baby's born I'm betting she'll think she can just \"drop by to help\" any time she feels like it - shut that down now, and don't apologize for it.", ">Surprise visits should be avoided for exactly this reason: you never know if the hosts are doing something or otherwise busy.\n\nAt this point the way to handle this is keep the doors locked (or take away their key and change the locks?

Or stand there and stare at them until they leave.", "YOU ARE RIGHT.", "NTA.

I would say that hopefully they have learned their lesson but I doubt they did and instead will just play victim.", "You are 6 weeks from having a newborn. Boundary setting needs to be hard and set right now and consistently. I guarantee that once baby arrives MIL will increase these drops-ins and you will be even less ready for visitors. Mentally, emotionally, house cleanliness, wearing clothes, etc.  Draw a line and hold it firm...  and start locking your doors now as a habit so you do when on sleep deprived autopilot after baby comes.", "NTA. Dropping by without asking is my biggest pet peeve.

I never remember to lock my front door, so I got a keypad lock that automatically locks the door for me 90 seconds after the door closes. Super handy.", "This is typical Reddit Aita: your in-laws presume and push and demand and stomp on your boundaries, and no sooner have you successfully stopped them and sent them on their way then you feel guilty.\n\nWhy? They're in the wrong, not you. The only reason your MIL feels she can dominate you is precisely because you go all squish when you stand up to her.\n\nAnd with a baby coming, you'd better make it clear to her just what the boundaries are. Or she will be on you like the wolf on the fold.", "NTA but this should be a boundary your wife is enforcing, not you.", "NTA\n\nI think you just saved yourself a lot of misery. One very blunt \"we aren't available\" should have them calling next time they want to visit.", "NTA,\n\nChange your locks if they have keys or anything. \n\nYour MIL is likely a narcassic, even if she isn't it is rarely (if ever) cool to just drop by someone's house when they have stated that they want advance notice. This goes more after an argument. \n\nI think you and your wife need very strong boundaries and possibly lc with the inlaws.", "Also, by setting a firm boundary now on the unexpected drop ins, you have precedence for setting the same boundary in 6 weeks when MIL is likely to do it even more once the baby arrives. \n\nIf you think unplanned visits are terrible now, just wait til it happens with a new baby in the mix."]}
