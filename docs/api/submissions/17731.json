Now, let's get into the situation that has caused a rift in my family and garnered quite a bit of controversy. Reddit, am I the asshole in this scenario?\n\nThe Story:\n\nI (32M) come from a fairly well-off family, and my sister (28F) has always relied on our parents for financial support. She's been in and out of various jobs and has struggled with stability. Recently, she informed the family that she's pregnant and in need of a place to stay.\n\nNaturally, my parents suggested that she move in with me and my wife (30F) since we have ample space in our home. However, my wife and I had already planned to convert the extra room into a home office for our growing business. We felt it was crucial to have a dedicated workspace to expand our careers and provide for our future family.\n\nWhen I expressed my concerns to my parents and sister, they accused me of being heartless and prioritizing work over family. They argued that as her brother, it was my duty to support her during this vulnerable time.\n\nI sympathize with my sister's situation, but I firmly believe that enabling her dependency on our parents would hinder her growth and personal development. I think it's essential for her to take responsibility for her own life and make choices that will lead to long-term stability.\n\nThe Conflict:\n\nReddit, here's where I need your judgment. AITA for not letting my pregnant sister move in with us? Am I being selfish for prioritizing my career and personal space over her immediate needs?

Family is often expected to support each other during challenging times, and by denying their sister a place to stay, the person may be seen as prioritizing their own convenience and personal goals over their sister's immediate needs. Some may argue that it is morally and socially expected to offer assistance to a pregnant family member, particularly when they are in a vulnerable situation. Refusing to help can be perceived as callous and lacking familial responsibility.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You can still offer her emotional and moral support, as well as practical advice and guidance. You can also help her find other resources or options that might suit her better. You are not abandoning her or cutting her off, you are just setting healthy boundaries and expectations.\n\n\r  \nOf course, this is just my opinion and you may disagree with it. Ultimately, you have to do what feels right for you and your family. I hope you can resolve this conflict peacefully and respectfully with your sister and parents.

You are not responsible for her or her current condition. NTA.", "\"Naturally, my parents suggested...\" , there is nothing natural about this.   \nFirst this is your sibling, not your child, and thus not your responsibility.   \nSecond, it's on your parents for not having taught her how to take care of herself, her bills and now her future as a mom.   \nThird, you are married, built a home/family with your wife, and have a career to build, before you expand your own family. \n\nHaving your sister move in, by the sounds of it, will also mean you are to take care of her every need, and soon after are probably expected to help take care of her little one... How about no.   \nYour parents raised her, but it sounds they're not quite done raising her. They can help her out.   \n\n\nNTA, something not your circus, something something... Stay firm on this. This is not on you to fix. And i'm pretty sure, your wife will thank you for it aswell.", "NTA\n\n\nThere is no rulebook stating how one must behave \"as a brother\" - and most certainly not when all the children are adults.\n\n\nI suspect what is really happening here is the sister and parents are working to move the sister from parental mooching to brotherly mooching as her overall life plan.  If she moved in, she was never planning to move out. \n\n\nNote: there's no point in explaining the thought process to the family. They aren't listening. Nor will they \"come around\" later. I expect this blow up would have happened eventually anyway, over some other excuse besides pregnancy.\n\n\nA person who is almost 30, still behaving like a helpless dependent, and now about to have a baby they cannot even house (never mind the rest of the baby's many needs) is rather disturbing. No one who wasn't involved ahead of time is required to help pick up the pieces.\n\n\nI do feel awfully sorry for that kid, though. The poor thing is nothing but a bargaining chip before it's even born.", "NTA. Lol it makes me laugh when parents think their responsible children will clean up messes with their irresponsible siblings. Don\u2019t move an inch. You owe your parents and sister 0. Do NOT let her move in on any way.", "NTA it isn\u2019t your duty to take care of an adult. Your sister is going to be a mother. She needs to get her shit together.\n\nPlus it isn\u2019t your parents right to tell you and your wife what to do in your home. If you let them force you into this it would be highly disrespectful to your wife. This will be a huge disruption to you house hold.\n\nYour parents realize how much work comes with a baby.. how much lack of sleep comes with a baby. They don\u2019t want to deal with it and they are trying to force you and your wife to take on the burden and the responsibility of a newborn that isn\u2019t yours.\n\nYou need to set firm boundaries that your sister and her child are not your responsibility. You will not be free housing or daycare for this child. No is a complete sentence.\n\n\nBut mainly grow up and set major boundaries with your parents.

Why on earth should your adult sibling and her future child be your responsibility? Her choices have led to this.

Did you help make the baby? No? Not your issue. Let your parents move her in.", "NTA. If she moves in, you will be supporting her and child financially for years.

Just because your parents enable her, that doesn't mean you have to.", "> they accused me of being heartless and prioritizing work over family\n\nNTA Accuse them back of prioritizing an irresponsible mooch's decisions over your own life choices.

It was unfair of your parents to volunteer you for this", "NTA\n\nJust refuse to discuss it further.", "The way you presented this feels weird like you\u2019re omitting details.
