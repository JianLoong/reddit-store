Now, let's get into the situation that has caused a rift in my family and garnered quite a bit of controversy. Reddit, am I the asshole in this scenario?\n\nThe Story:\n\nI (32M) come from a fairly well-off family, and my sister (28F) has always relied on our parents for financial support. She's been in and out of various jobs and has struggled with stability. Recently, she informed the family that she's pregnant and in need of a place to stay.\n\nNaturally, my parents suggested that she move in with me and my wife (30F) since we have ample space in our home. However, my wife and I had already planned to convert the extra room into a home office for our growing business. We felt it was crucial to have a dedicated workspace to expand our careers and provide for our future family.\n\nWhen I expressed my concerns to my parents and sister, they accused me of being heartless and prioritizing work over family. They argued that as her brother, it was my duty to support her during this vulnerable time.\n\nI sympathize with my sister's situation, but I firmly believe that enabling her dependency on our parents would hinder her growth and personal development. I think it's essential for her to take responsibility for her own life and make choices that will lead to long-term stability.\n\nThe Conflict:\n\nReddit, here's where I need your judgment. AITA for not letting my pregnant sister move in with us? Am I being selfish for prioritizing my career and personal space over her immediate needs? Or is it fair to expect her to stand on her own two feet and make responsible decisions?\n\nPlease share your thoughts and help me understand whether I'm genuinely in the wrong or if my perspective is justified.", "created_utc": 1684584168, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13mq3ku/aita_for_not_letting_my_pregnant_sister_move_in/", "score": 60, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Family is often expected to support each other during challenging times, and by denying their sister a place to stay, the person may be seen as prioritizing their own convenience and personal goals over their sister's immediate needs. Some may argue that it is morally and socially expected to offer assistance to a pregnant family member, particularly when they are in a vulnerable situation. Refusing to help can be perceived as callous and lacking familial responsibility.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

In the long run, she can\u2019t be reliant upon your parents forever. However, it won\u2019t hurt to help her out in some way now that she is having a baby.

I do believe family should help each other, but not to the point of always being dependent upon them. Your sister has taken things so far, and while I sympathize with her situation it\u2019s really hard to justify letting her live with one of the family members for free after all the financial support she has already received.

And obviously she was struggling financially before she got pregnant and still had unprotected sex. That\u2019s on her (and the guy) not you.

However, based on the information you provided, I would say that you are NTA in this scenario. Here are my reasons:\r  \n\r  \nYou have a valid reason for not wanting to give up your extra room. It is not just a matter of convenience or preference, but a necessity for your career and future plans. You have worked hard to achieve your goals and you deserve to pursue them without sacrificing your personal space and comfort.\n\n\r  \nYou are not obligated to provide housing for your sister just because you are her brother. She is an adult and she should be able to take care of herself. It is not fair for your parents to pressure you into taking on such a huge responsibility that you did not sign up for. You have your own life and family to consider, and you should not have to compromise them for someone else\u2019s choices.\n\n\r  \nYou are not being heartless or unsupportive of your sister. You can still offer her emotional and moral support, as well as practical advice and guidance. You can also help her find other resources or options that might suit her better. You are not abandoning her or cutting her off, you are just setting healthy boundaries and expectations.\n\n\r  \nOf course, this is just my opinion and you may disagree with it. Ultimately, you have to do what feels right for you and your family. I hope you can resolve this conflict peacefully and respectfully with your sister and parents.

That's part of being a parent - you either teach your kid how to look after themselves and take responsibility for their own actions, or, if incapable of that, you have to shoulder their burdens as penalty for not teaching them to be independent.

She should be taking responsibility unless she really needs a place to stay and cant afford it etc\u2026 But if funds arent an issue she should be taking responsibility in all aspects as an adult that is expecting a child.
