{"id": 5354, "submission_id": "zsg9qk", "title": "AITA for offering my brothers a place to stay and calling CPS on my parents?", "selftext": "I (28M) have been low contact with my family for a very long time, practically since I started college a decade ago, the only exception is my brother, let's call him Alexis (15M), who I've been writing letters to practically since I left, he's always been my baby boy and we were very close in those first few years of his life. \n\nA few weeks ago I got a call from him panicked out of his arse, apparently he's been left home alone with our youngest brother Jon (5M), for almost five months now. This isn't out of character for my parents, they've never been the most attentive, but I used to believe it was on me, they had me when they themselves were kids you see, and I figured they resented me for it, I realise now they just suck. It broke my heart he didn't have the courage to tell me sooner but I told him they'd always be welcomed at our home.\n\nMy parents' house is pretty close to our house, so I offered to pick my brothers up for a brotherly bonding sleepover, Alexis texted my parents for permission, just to make sure we weren't as likely to be accused of kidnapping and after they said yes I drove and picked them up, (I would have probably gone and stayed there or at least dropped off stuff regularly if they had said no).\n\nI got to meet my babiest brother!  He settled down surprisingly easy, my daughter is around his age which definitely helped. \nMe and Alexis got to have a few moments alone while he was settling down in the guest room and he just broke down, he was so exhausted and stressed from having to be an adult and care for Jon for so long. I couldn't be prouder of him but I'm so so sad and angry that he hasn't gotten to enjoy his first year of Highschool at all because of this.\n\nI asked a friend of mine who works with CPS what could be done and she recommended I keep them in my care with my parents permission and report the whole situation. So I did.\n\nTook CPS a bit to step in but there's finally been some movement, my brothers had to go back to my parents house for a bit. I've been told they either have to go to another adult in our family, which will have to be me, since our aunt's and uncles are back in our home country or go into the system, which I refuse to allow. That's where where at for now, dealing with all that.\n\nI thought I was doing the right thing but recently some of my friends from college are telling me I acted without thinking and could ruin my brothers lives as well as our parents'. And 2 of my aunt's have even come to visit and absolutely berated me for putting all of this on my parents, I've also gotten countless calls from family back in our home country calling me a selfish bastard.  I understand my parents have struggled a lot in their lives and I can see how my actions may absolutely ruin their lives but I can't just do nothing, still all this talk and especially my college friends have me anxious and confused so...

CPS should have been involved 4.5 months ago. Your brother is incredible BUT he should never have been in that position.\n\nYou did not ruin anyone's life. Your parents made a choice to leave a young teen in charge of a young child without adult supervision indefinitely. That was a choice and choices have consequences. Their consequence will likely be losing custody of their sons. \n\nFor your friends - tell them their attitude is the reason child abuse perpetuates. For your Aunts, ask them where they were and why they weren't helping your brother? Ask them why they think a 15 year old should be the sole caretaker for a 5 year old when both have been abandoned by their parents? Ask your family members back home if they plan on moving their to live in the home to care for both boys since your parents are clearly unwilling to.\n\nYou absolutely did the right thing.", "NTA Ignore those auntie assholes and other problematic adults. It doesn't matter if they have money you do not leave a 15 year old and a 5 year old ALONE for months.

Your parents abandoned a 5 year old to a 15 year olds care for five months.

NTA- for calling CPS. There might have been \"better\" actions you could have taken but given what you were facing you've done your best.", "NTA, 1. Thank you so much for stepping up for your brothers and that Alex knows he can count on you. And thank you for relieving him of the stress so he can be a child and enjoy high school. \n2. Your parents should be jailed for this. This is child neglect and it\u2019s abuse. Your brothers shouldn\u2019t have to go through. 3. Your family and friends who tell you, you were wrong are clearly child abusive themselves. I\u2019d reconsider those friendships because children should always come first. 4. CPS was the best to call, and I hope for your brothers\u2019 sake they give them to you, because they stand a better chance.", "You did exactly the right thing. ANYTHING could have happened to those boys. You gave them a place of love and safety, which is exactly what your brother knew you would do; that's why he called you. Ignore friends and family who have berated you; the only people who are A H in this situation are your parents. If they get it trouble, so be it. They abandoned their children for 5 months. God forbid there had been an accident/break in/house fire etc and they'd been injured or killed, people's opinions would be extremely different. It's down to you that they're safe and well. You're a great brother and an amazing man to step up like this. Even as a stranger, I'm so proud of you- your brothers will never forget this. NTA NTA NTA", "NTA. You are an amazing big brother and you're doing a wonderful job.", "NTA. If your parents are really doing their best, they will be cleared. But if not, that's on them. I want to drill down on the really important part here:\n\n\\>   I've been told they either have to go to another adult in our family, which will have to be me, since our aunt's and uncles are back in our home country or go into the system, which I refuse to allow. \n\nThat's really bad. \n\nIn terms of CPS, that means that immediate safety concerns have been identified by the investigator. CPS is not just saying your parents are bad parents, they are saying that if your siblings are left there, they are concerned harm will come to them. CPS has basically said they are confident that if they take this in front of a judge, they are confident the judge will order removal of the children from your parents' home temporarily. This removal is likely just for a few days, depending on jurisdiction, unless CPS and the courts are concerned your parents will not or cannot address the safety concerns.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Going L/N/C with any relatives or friends is probably best because you probably saved your brothers from a terrible situation. No high schooler should be subjected to parentification.

They do not deserve to have kids, and I note they\u2019re not among the people calling you the AH in this. The ones calling you selfish, ask them how are you less selfish than the people who abandoned their kids?", "NTA but your parents are. Leaving a 15 year old for months to look after a 5 year old is child negligence and abuse bundled into one. Not sure what they were so busy with to go for months doing whatever shit they were upto. They don't deserve to have or keep kids as they dont have a single parenting bone in their body. Tell all of those relatives who call to get stuffed and to mind their own business as none of them were there for you when you or brothers needed them.

But you are doing the right thing to protect these kids. Those who don't know the whole story won't  understand. I've had people lecture me about \"stealing\" a foster kid from their parents, when that kid a) begged the state to take them out of their parent's abusive  home. B) got to choose my home from several options and c) had hundreds of nightmares that their avusive parents might somehow \"get\" them again and only felt safe enough to sleep if I was within earshot,  preferably sleeping on the hallway floor in front of their bedroom.\n\nMy point is strangers and college students and uninformed relatives might not understand you are doing the right thing,  but you are. They also won't have any idea what you and your brothers have been through. I hope you can get them some trauma-informed therapist. Good luck, you good man.", "Vehemently NTA. Any time doubt tries to creep in, or the silence of the night gives way to the voices of those who would say you've done wrong, I want you to focus on one thing: the memory of your brother breaking down. \n\nI'm sure the look on his face, as he cried from relief and exhaustion, is forever etched into your memory. The poor kid probably shook once he was finally safe to fall apart. You likely recognize the pain in his eyes, because it's no different than the eyes you saw in the mirror when you were his age. \n\nYour parents neglect is different this time, because you're in the position to be the kind of person you needed to intervene back when you were your brothers age.\n\nRemember those things, and never doubt yourself again.

Your college friends (who are presumably educated and should know better) are useless immoral gutter trash for suggesting you abandon a 15yr old and a small child who have already been abandoned by all the other adults they should have been able to trust. You may well have saved your siblings lives. Never regret having the courage to be what was needed when every one else was a coward. That's the problem with your \"family\". Your courage to do right by these children highlights their failures as the adults to do right by you. Rather than face their own disgusting behavior, its more convenient to make you doubt yours.
