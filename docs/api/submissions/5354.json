This isn't out of character for my parents, they've never been the most attentive, but I used to believe it was on me, they had me when they themselves were kids you see, and I figured they resented me for it, I realise now they just suck. It broke my heart he didn't have the courage to tell me sooner but I told him they'd always be welcomed at our home.\n\nMy parents' house is pretty close to our house, so I offered to pick my brothers up for a brotherly bonding sleepover, Alexis texted my parents for permission, just to make sure we weren't as likely to be accused of kidnapping and after they said yes I drove and picked them up, (I would have probably gone and stayed there or at least dropped off stuff regularly if they had said no).\n\nI got to meet my babiest brother!  He settled down surprisingly easy, my daughter is around his age which definitely helped. \nMe and Alexis got to have a few moments alone while he was settling down in the guest room and he just broke down, he was so exhausted and stressed from having to be an adult and care for Jon for so long. I couldn't be prouder of him but I'm so so sad and angry that he hasn't gotten to enjoy his first year of Highschool at all because of this.\n\nI asked a friend of mine who works with CPS what could be done and she recommended I keep them in my care with my parents permission and report the whole situation. So I did.\n\nTook CPS a bit to step in but there's finally been some movement, my brothers had to go back to my parents house for a bit. I've been told they either have to go to another adult in our family, which will have to be me, since our aunt's and uncles are back in our home country or go into the system, which I refuse to allow. That's where where at for now, dealing with all that.\n\nI thought I was doing the right thing but recently some of my friends from college are telling me I acted without thinking and could ruin my brothers lives as well as our parents'.

Going to college. Getting married. Having families of their own one day. And remember that your actions today are what is going to allow them to have these lives.

What happened to you in particular is not that relevant to which one of us is right about this.\n \nThere are also plenty of families and children who have been damaged by an overactive CPS and LEO enforcement apparatus. There is very little way to eliminate all opportunities for error. And there is also the very real possibility that a child will feel undergo intense trauma from the government's actions in a dependency case.\n\nWe live in a democratic society.

You were raised in an abusive home. You didn't grow up learning what most of society considered \"normal.\" Instead, you were learning how to survive.\n\nThat fear of ruining things for your parents was purposefully instilled. Silence empowers the abuser, so they use things like shame and guilt to make sure their victims feel powerless and stay quiet. Even adults fall prey to that kind of manipulation. What chance did you as an innocent child have?\n\nIn case you just thought \"but I'm an adult, I should have seen it and known better,\" I want to preemptively try and tell you why it isn't that easy. I'm sure this will get long, but I want to try my best to get my message across. \n\nMy husband appeared to have a happy and loving family from the outside, but I saw little red flags early on. It was only after he saw how my parents and I interacted that something in him clicked. When we got in my car to leave, he just kept mumbling about it, almost like he was in shock. That moment was a catalyst.\n\nAs he shared stories over time, he came to realize how unhealthy his family dynamic was. He was isolated and controlled. The first time he didn't immediately capitulate, things went off the rails. *Fast.* \n\nThe attempts to manipulate were well done, but my husband saw through them by then. It ended with me at the police station, asking an officer at what point I should come to them for help. He told me we were well past that point.\n\nIt's been 10 years without any contact. My husband is now 38. That means he was 27/28 before he realized how bad things were. He had an idea, but he had always told himself he must be wrong. It wasn't until an outside voice told him he wasn't wrong that he finally saw it all for what it was. It wasn't an easy journey for him. He admitted that he knew he was really struggling, but he couldn't figure out why. That's what toxic and abusive people create in their victims\n\nSometimes it's easier to see a bit of ourselves in others. I'm hoping you'll read my husband's story and give yourself a break, because you've been victimized by your family, too. Be patient and show yourself the kindness your parents didn't. \n\nIf you haven't tried therapy before, it's really worth considering. Being validated by a professional really helped my husband. It's helped me as well over the years, so I'm a huge proponent.\n\nSorry, I know this got ridiculously long. I just wanted to be your cheerleader for a moment. I know difficulties lie ahead, but you're strong. I know you'll do all you can, and Alex knows that too.

My aunt has hinted that she'd like to take custody but I'm committed to getting them in my care.
