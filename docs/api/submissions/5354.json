This isn't out of character for my parents, they've never been the most attentive, but I used to believe it was on me, they had me when they themselves were kids you see, and I figured they resented me for it, I realise now they just suck. It broke my heart he didn't have the courage to tell me sooner but I told him they'd always be welcomed at our home.\n\nMy parents' house is pretty close to our house, so I offered to pick my brothers up for a brotherly bonding sleepover, Alexis texted my parents for permission, just to make sure we weren't as likely to be accused of kidnapping and after they said yes I drove and picked them up, (I would have probably gone and stayed there or at least dropped off stuff regularly if they had said no).\n\nI got to meet my babiest brother!  He settled down surprisingly easy, my daughter is around his age which definitely helped. \nMe and Alexis got to have a few moments alone while he was settling down in the guest room and he just broke down, he was so exhausted and stressed from having to be an adult and care for Jon for so long. I couldn't be prouder of him but I'm so so sad and angry that he hasn't gotten to enjoy his first year of Highschool at all because of this.\n\nI asked a friend of mine who works with CPS what could be done and she recommended I keep them in my care with my parents permission and report the whole situation. So I did.\n\nTook CPS a bit to step in but there's finally been some movement, my brothers had to go back to my parents house for a bit. I've been told they either have to go to another adult in our family, which will have to be me, since our aunt's and uncles are back in our home country or go into the system, which I refuse to allow. That's where where at for now, dealing with all that.\n\nI thought I was doing the right thing but recently some of my friends from college are telling me I acted without thinking and could ruin my brothers lives as well as our parents'. And 2 of my aunt's have even come to visit and absolutely berated me for putting all of this on my parents, I've also gotten countless calls from family back in our home country calling me a selfish bastard.
