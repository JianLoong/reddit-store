During last year she has gain 40lbs and was depressed about it. \n\nSo I suggested we should go hiking or we could go bowling or play soccer. Last two are her favorite when we go out with friends. She was a hesitant but agree to go bowling. We had our fun and some friends invited us for a late night hike close to their house. The spot is like 15min hike from their house and has an amazing view.\n\nWe took breaks like every 2 minutes because she was out of breath. After 30 min i told out friends they should go on and we will meet them at the top. I tried to motivate my gf, but she wasn\u2019t having it. She told me it was easy for me and that I didn\u2019t know how bad it was for her. She gave up completely mid way through. I slipped and said that maybe is she should workout to stay in shape.\n\nShe screamed at me and hike down to our friend\u2019s house. I hike up and meet out friend and stayed up there for like 30 minutes before going back down. She left a note she got an Uber back to her apartment.\n\nEdit: i get it i am the AH. I tried to apologize but she blocked me on everything, our mutual friends got blocked as well and her friends called me a sexist pig when i text them if they knew about my gf.

I\u2019m sure you meant well but when you say stuff like that, it just adds shame. When it comes to weight and fitness, your job as a partner is to support her in her journey, not try and be her fitness instructor.

I know because I\u2019m one of them. At first I would blow up on anyone who would comment on my weight, doctors, friends, family etc. I always had an excuse for why I\u2019m fat and would not think that some of the things that people were telling me, like eating healthy or exercising were actually things I should be doing. I always told everyone how hard it was for me etc and yes, it was hard but I never made any progress with anything because all I did was complain. \n\nNow, does your GF want to do something about her weight or is she just feeling sorry for herself? Has she tried seeking help or is she just finding excuse after excuse to not to do anything? Are you being mean to her about her weight often? Does it bother you? Or do you genuinely want her to be happy and healthy? She needs to understand that that extra weight is bad for her and she needs to make peace with that. If she doesn\u2019t then every time you or someone else mentions it she will blow up. The ball is in her corner. What you can do is to talk to her, be supportive and encouraging. Unfortunately, most overweight girls will feel that they are being judged and laughed at even if that\u2019s not the case. Sometimes there is no win-win situation and whatever you do, you always be a horrible person in her eyes. \n\nWhen I read your post it doesn\u2019t sound like you are mean to her etc. you just raised a valid point and if she doesn\u2019t understand it it\u2019s not your problem.", "NTA, shes unaware of her self sabotaging and not only that but she put herself to the hike you didnt force it.

But she places herself in the position to j sit with her weight, and that isnt on you. Yeah ik shes depressed about it but after a while soft love is just enabling.", "If the genders were reversed no one would be calling you the asshole so NTA", "NTA giving someone good advice doesn't make you a bad person.

If a 15 minute walk is causing your partner to become out of breath I'd say that there is a big difference between your fitness levels and you likely are not able to empathize with her situation as well. For her this is a difficult task and backhanded comments are putting her down more than raising her up. \n\nCome up with an actual strategy for this. If a 15 minute walk is too much, doing bowling after will make it even worse, especially if they get self conscious about their out of breath state when with your friends. Start with walks, move onto power walking, move onto jogging. The process is more important to focus on than the results. They will come with consistency and time most importantly. \n\nLastly as someone who has trained a few people in the gym. Make sure their milestones are accomplished, help them realise the progress they are making by pointing out these important events. If they are struggling with motivation then it is your job to keep them on track, tell them that you are helping them because you love them and want them to achieve their goals. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck to her on her journey.

We\u2019re not baffled as to how we put on the weight, or what we might have done differently to keep it off, or how to go about losing it. I pinkie promise you, the phrase \u201cdiet & exercise\u201d is permanently ingrained into the brains of at least every woman in the US, because we\u2019re constantly bombarded with beauty standards and diet pills and programs and the phrase \u201cnothing tastes as good as skinny feels\u201d and some new class our girlfriends can\u2019t stop raving about \u201cthat\u2019s like\u2026 hot yoga, but in a pole fitness studio, so the whole routine is done completely upside down\u201d or something equally absurd. She didn\u2019t need a man to step in and point out that she\u2019d be fit enough to keep up with the rest of the group if she\u2019d just work out more. Like no shit, Sherlock? Way to highlight everything she\u2019s clearly already insecure about there! \n\nTotally voting YTA.", "Hence, my use of the word \u201cemphasize.\u201d", "It\u2019s not kicking them, because she has the opportunity to do something about it.", "For sure. I was mainly highlighting how if a sensible/measured conversation was to be had, this was probably the worst time for it, lol.  No shit, Sherlock - exactly.", "How pedantic of you. Emphasizing such a thing in such a moment makes one an asshole. Personally, I do not believe there is anything wrong with being an asshole if that is what you want in life. It is often what I want though not always. Are you arguing that op is not an asshole?\n\nI think we all family grasp why it was said. It still makes OP an asshole.", "Not in that moment, she doesn't.  This is a conversation to be had later.", "I\u2019m pedantic because I\u2019m using words how they are intended? I said OP emphasized the point; but you\u2019re implying that I thought he was informing her of the fact. I\u2019m correcting your misapprehension of the situation.  \n\nOP is NTA. Girlfriend is depressed about her weight, but isn\u2019t doing anything about it.", "It\u2019s not kicking her while she\u2019s down. She could\u2019ve said \u201cyou\u2019re right, I\u2019ll start looking at gyms tomorrow.\u201d", "\u201cCorrecting **Your** misapprehension\u201d", "Ah yes, the best way to get someone that literally just gave up climbing a hill to get motivated to go to gym - rub it in while she can barely catch her breath so she cannot immediately tell you what an asshole you are. Excellent relationship advice!", "Ah well, agree to disagree.", "But that\u2019s all you have. You don\u2019t have an argument, just my typo. I fixed it, by the way. And I gave you an upvote\ud83d\udc4d", "Thanks!", "A single comment is not rubbing it in, unless you are emotionally immature.", "Me too", "You\u2019re pedantic because you\u2019re pedantic. You didn\u2019t respond to my question so I thought we were just quibbling.\n\nEdit oh I see you did. Please support your argument. Girlfriend came out of the house and went on a hike. That is doing something about it. \n\nInstead of supporting her, op tore her down verbally. Please explain how this is not an asshole move.", "If you know that your partner was depressed about her weight gain previously and is currently having really big difficulties with physical activity - as to much to \"completely give up\" in front of friends that participated in said activity - yeah, it is rubbing it in. It is literally flogging a dead horse.", "Support your argument that I\u2019m \u201cpedantic\u201dfirst. You made an accusation and apparently can\u2019t back it up.", "He made the comment in private, after the rest of the group continued on the hike.  \n\nAnd his girlfriend is not a horse and she is not dead, so I\u2019m not sure why you use the word literally."]}
