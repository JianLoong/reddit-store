{"id": 15128, "submission_id": "12r2u29", "title": "AITA for telling a guys girlfriend that he let our female friend change in front of him?", "selftext": "I (26F) have a friend Gracie, (24F) that ive known for a year. She has a guy friend Leo (34M), that she has known for 4 years. She says he looks out for her and is quite protective of her, such as how a big brother is. They talk daily and hangout a few times a week. Gracie gets along well with Leos girlfriend, but they aren't close. I've hung out with them all a handful of times, and I only know Leo through Gracie.\n\nLast week the three of us all hung out and went to meet up Leo's girlfriend and her friends at dinner. Leo, Gracie and I were all in the car together as Gracie had invited me to surf with them for a bit that afternoon before dinner.\n\nWhen we get to the restaurant, Gracie decided she didn't want to wear her swimsuit and coverup and would rather put on normal clothes which she had in the car. She said she didn't want to go inside and change though, so she was just going to wear her swimsuit and cover. Leo then suggested she just open the car doors and change there, and that he would stand guard for her. She agreed and did just that. When he suggested it, i presumed he would have his back to her, but instead he stood facing her and chatted with her as she changed. It seemed very natural to them, but it made me uncomfortable to see them act like that.\n\nGracie changed, and we went inside and met up with the rest of the group. When we got there, I was sat next to Leo's girlfriend. After a few minutes I leaned over to her and quietly told her \"I just wanted to let you know, Leo just let Gracie change out of her swimmer in front of him. With how they acted, it seemed like they do this often. I'd want to know if it was my boyfriend so i just thought I'd tell you\". She laughed and responded \"yeah, that kinda thing happens occasionally. They've been best friends for years, im not worried about it. Thanks tho\"\n\nApparently she told Gracie and Leo that I said that, and Gracie accused me of trying to start drama. She's mad at me and said that it wasn't my place, and that i could have asked her first and she would've explained. AITA?\n\nTLDR: told my friends, friends, girlfriend that he saw her nude. She said im trying to start drama and acting immature, aita?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT TO ADD: Apparently when Leo's gf told them that, Leo responded with \"boobs are boobs. You see one, you've seen them all\", which honestly makes it even weirder.\n\nEDIT 2: It got all scrambled some how, tried to fix it\n\nEdit 3: I was told to edit this into my post, Gracie is Scandinavian. First generation American, but spent a lot of her childhood in Scandinavia.   \nAlso, her and Leo know each other because she used to date his friend. When he found out how bad the relationship was, he helped her leave, and they became close after.

It\u2019s really weird that you did that.

Leo\u2019s girlfriend bringing it up with him seems kind of crappy too. Ultimately, I commend OP for living by their personal golden rule and looking out for someone else.

I can understand the idea that maybe she should have asked Gracie about it directly before doing anything else, but I also think it was something worth mentioning to the gf just as a heads up. Like you said, I would also want to know.  \n\nI also feel a bit iffy about the age gap as well.  Theres a 10 year age gap isn't there? (Sorry can't see ops post) And they've known each other for 4 years, so she was 20 and he was 30?  That could be totally fine and on the level, I don't know, I don't know these people, but does it give me pause?  Yeah, a bit. It's not like they were childhood friends that grew up together. I don't know. I would expect people, regardless of gender, to look away if I  was changing.  They could stay and talk, whatever, but we don't have to have eye contact. Lol maybe that's just me though. \n\nI guess I'm going to go NAH.  Because I agree with op that something feels weird about the situation, but I can also see why Gracie would feel like op was inserting herself into something that doesn't concern her. Ultimately if everyone involved doesn't care what they do, that's the end of it.  If op let's it go from here on out, then I don't think they're the asshole.\n\nEta: I reread ops post and just wanted to confirm that I got the ages right. Lol. Also, I misread earlier and thought that op and the gf were strangers, but if I read it correctly this time, it seems like they have hung out before? And op has only known Gracie a year?  Yeah that makes her even less of an asshole in my eyes. It sounds like she was closer with Gracie, but still didnt know her all that long.  Maybe it still wasn't ops business, but I can see why her loyalty was split.\n\nEdit: sorry for the deleted comment earlier. I am an idiot.  Meant to edit, but replied to my comment. Ugh.  Long day.", "I'd want to know if my boyfriend did that\n\n  \nShe did the right thing", "Then why does she need someone to stand there and guard her?", "Yes. Why does it seem american?", "It really does. I can't count the times I've changed with other people m/f present and I don't care to even try. It is not a sexual thing. I need to get out of bikini / sports gear / spa robe / something I spilled something on / other and into something else.\n\nAnd then back to regular scheduled content.", "Probably because if they were cheating they would just lie and say GF was cool with it. OP did the right thing by bringing it up to GF. It's shitty not knowing about things going on behind your back.

The gf is fine with it so that\u2019s the end. Gracie is trying to start drama out of something she says isn\u2019t a big deal. Its weird. Not like OP freaked out, unlike Gracie.", "This is exactly right. If she had concerns with the situation, the first person to talk to should be her own friend - not her friend's friend's girlfriend. (And on top of that, OP seems just slightly over worked up about nudity.)", "If she really wanted to know about why Gracie changed in front of him she should have pulled Gracie, her main friend side first and brought it up. Instead she tattled on them. What adult does that? Lol", "I love your comment! It perfectly describes what I wanted to say but couldn\u2019t find the words!", "They did it right out in the open... in the parking lot of the restaurant girlfriend was at. Clearly they're not trying to hide something...", "No, not when it\u2019s out in a parking lot and wet swim wear.", "Actually, most people would find it entirely appropriate in this situation", "Be honest about what? This had nothing to do with the girlfriend.  Besides, breasts are just for delivering milk, and the vagina is just for delivering babies.  Right, Reddit?", "I see only one dumbass. It is ok to be nude around a friend if both are ok with it,  stop making shit up", "If your partner is out cheating I hope nobody tells you", "Thank you. That was my point, but apparently they claim its pretty normal for surfers to change after a sesh.

I don't think she'd be okay with you seeing Gracie naked..\" to which they could have responded and explained that it's a normal thing for them and that she's fine with it.

Clearly Gracie does not see their behavior as anything but normal/friendly, and despite what I think, despite what OP thinks about that level of friendliness, Gracie will be forever left with \"my friend's sense of normal makes her assume my behavior is inappropriate\". \n\nEither there is something weird/sexual happening, and if OP found out, she would not want to be Gracie's friend anymore I imagine, or nothing at all weird is happening, and OP created a rift that will most likely stay open.

We\u2019ve seen so many other posts about the significant other finding out all the people in their friend group knew of behavior and never told them about it. I say NTA. Like yes your friend has a right to be mad, but honestly I think if I was in that situation I would say something to. I would want to know if my partner did something similar.

Leo could\u2019ve easily turned around\u2026his job was to guard her from the onlookers.

Are you sure that's appropriate? \n\nGracie: How *dare* you! Leo looks out for me! There's nothing wrong with anything we did! \n\nOp: What would his girlfriend think? Many women would be very uncomfortable with you doing this with their boyfriend. \n\nGracie:  she's fine with it! You shouldn't even bring it up to her! It will only make everyone uncomfortable/ laugh at you if you try to talk to her about it. \n\nOp would now be both incredibly uncomfortable and suspicious, as would anyone when a woman who undressed in front of someone else's boyfriend insisted it was fine. \n\nGracie needs to take into account that no matter how wonderful and honest you are, no one who says \"that's fine and you shouldn't bring this up to his girlfriend\" ever sounds like they are being honest. \n\nFor op, this was a no-win situation. Staying quiet would have felt like dishonesty, going to Gracie and Leo would have also felt like that, with a side order of feeling like op's friends were just totally fine lying to her face with their highly improbable explanation, and telling the girlfriend was either going to result in this, or the possible end of a relationship. \n\nOp may be drama seeking, but there's still no actual good answer to this problem, and Gracie is naive if she thinks that op coming and taking to her first was going to clear anything up. Or be anything other than highly suspicious.", "You know you\u2019re right I honestly don\u2019t blame Gracie for being hurt.

It\u2019s wayyy too common that people just sit back and watch this stuff happen, and then claim to have never seen anything out of the ordinary when there\u2019s cheating in the relationship. If someone came to me and informed me in that way, that my boyfriend had done something like that, my first reaction would not be anger. Just because OP doesn\u2019t know the dynamics of the relationship, doesn\u2019t mean they were trying to \u201cstart drama\u201d or be up on a high horse. Cheating has been massively normalized, and I\u2019d be grateful to have someone willing to step out of their own comfort zone to inform me of something they think is wrong. If I disagree?

They've decided that because Gracie likes boys and is seemingly a romantic person, that means she has zero regard for Leo's girlfriend, and is only pretending to be friends with Leo to get into his pants and make him cheat on her. Gross. Also ew, why are you accusing him of being a creep for being ten years older than Gracie? That was never the concern, it wasn't mentioned by OP, and there's not much reason to think it.

On that basis NAH.\n\nFor me, I definitely wouldn't trust a supposedly heterosexual man who said \"boobs are boobs, you see one you've seen them all\".

We all know the opposite gender has no value outside of their ability to smash", "Schrodinger's Adulterers.  They're simultaneously very comfortable flaunting their wanton behavior in public, and incredibly secretive about their wanton behavior when questioned.  They get off on being questioned and then denying it.\n\n... goddamnit that is probably an accurate decision of someone's fetish isn't it?", "Strangers seeing, and people you know seeing, aren\u2019t the same. He\u2019s blocking the door to protect her privacy from strangers. Which is what you do when someone\u2019s changing.", "That's fair, but, back to the post, doesn't really matter the girls' view on nudity\n\nStrippers are okay with people looking at their tits. Doesn't mean \"Leo\" should be doing so if it's not within his relationships' boundaries", "I'm pretty sure we're actually supposed to view their ability to smash as horrifying and terrible at any moment they are not currently smashing.  And even then, if it's not properly approved style of smashing, it's probably still horrifying and terrible.  That's why we're supposed to keep a constant vigilance over the sexual inclination of everyone we know, to guard against filth.", "Almost definitely. I'd call it Schroyeurism, personally.", "yeah it's another debate, but they seemed ok with that so i see no problem with it. OP could \"snitch\" (maybe making her friend think that OP believes she would make the boyfriend cheat) that's not a real problem, but being judgemental after knowing that all of the 3 people involved are ok with the situation is a problem (she said it's \"weird\" in her edit)", "Ok, the previous goddamning was nothing compared the damnation which my inability to pay for an award for that deserves.  \n\nPlease accept my most grudging, side-eying respect in lieu of anythign that actually costs money or requires effort."]}
