{"id": 15128, "submission_id": "12r2u29", "title": "AITA for telling a guys girlfriend that he let our female friend change in front of him?", "selftext": "I (26F) have a friend Gracie, (24F) that ive known for a year. She has a guy friend Leo (34M), that she has known for 4 years. She says he looks out for her and is quite protective of her, such as how a big brother is. They talk daily and hangout a few times a week. Gracie gets along well with Leos girlfriend, but they aren't close. I've hung out with them all a handful of times, and I only know Leo through Gracie.\n\nLast week the three of us all hung out and went to meet up Leo's girlfriend and her friends at dinner. Leo, Gracie and I were all in the car together as Gracie had invited me to surf with them for a bit that afternoon before dinner.\n\nWhen we get to the restaurant, Gracie decided she didn't want to wear her swimsuit and coverup and would rather put on normal clothes which she had in the car. She said she didn't want to go inside and change though, so she was just going to wear her swimsuit and cover. Leo then suggested she just open the car doors and change there, and that he would stand guard for her. She agreed and did just that. When he suggested it, i presumed he would have his back to her, but instead he stood facing her and chatted with her as she changed. It seemed very natural to them, but it made me uncomfortable to see them act like that.\n\nGracie changed, and we went inside and met up with the rest of the group. When we got there, I was sat next to Leo's girlfriend. After a few minutes I leaned over to her and quietly told her \"I just wanted to let you know, Leo just let Gracie change out of her swimmer in front of him. With how they acted, it seemed like they do this often. I'd want to know if it was my boyfriend so i just thought I'd tell you\". She laughed and responded \"yeah, that kinda thing happens occasionally. They've been best friends for years, im not worried about it. Thanks tho\"\n\nApparently she told Gracie and Leo that I said that, and Gracie accused me of trying to start drama. She's mad at me and said that it wasn't my place, and that i could have asked her first and she would've explained. AITA?\n\nTLDR: told my friends, friends, girlfriend that he saw her nude. She said im trying to start drama and acting immature, aita?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT TO ADD: Apparently when Leo's gf told them that, Leo responded with \"boobs are boobs. You see one, you've seen them all\", which honestly makes it even weirder.\n\nEDIT 2: It got all scrambled some how, tried to fix it ", "created_utc": 1681848992, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12r2u29/aita_for_telling_a_guys_girlfriend_that_he_let/", "score": 98, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s really weird that you did that. They have all known each other longer than you\u2019ve known them so they way you went about it without even mentioning or asking Gracie does in fact look like you were trying to start drama. The fact that they did it so casually actually should have told you that it most likely was not a big deal.

Not your business how they manage themselves.", "Honestly the YTA opinions are tiring. NTA.

Idk it might be different as we're all women", "If all of them are comfortable with it, why are they so mad at OP? Sounds really strange to me. Leo\u2019s girlfriend bringing it up with him seems kind of crappy too. Ultimately, I commend OP for living by their personal golden rule and looking out for someone else. You dropped it after that, you weren\u2019t looking to gossip, you were just honestly informing her as you would have wanted to be.\n\nOf course Gracie would have explained it away regardless of what was happening. Your friends are capable of lying.", "If the girlfriend posted here she clearly wouldn't be ok with it or wouldn't waste her time posting...", "But the point is the GF isn't posting here.  She's clearly aware of it and has been around their dynamic and doesn't mind.  Also, if the GF was posting here, it would be because it was about HER relationship.

I can understand the idea that maybe she should have asked Gracie about it directly before doing anything else, but I also think it was something worth mentioning to the gf just as a heads up. Like you said, I would also want to know.  \n\nI also feel a bit iffy about the age gap as well.  Theres a 10 year age gap isn't there? (Sorry can't see ops post) And they've known each other for 4 years, so she was 20 and he was 30?  That could be totally fine and on the level, I don't know, I don't know these people, but does it give me pause?  Yeah, a bit. It's not like they were childhood friends that grew up together. I don't know. I would expect people, regardless of gender, to look away if I  was changing.  They could stay and talk, whatever, but we don't have to have eye contact. Lol maybe that's just me though. \n\nI guess I'm going to go NAH.  Because I agree with op that something feels weird about the situation, but I can also see why Gracie would feel like op was inserting herself into something that doesn't concern her. Ultimately if everyone involved doesn't care what they do, that's the end of it.  If op let's it go from here on out, then I don't think they're the asshole.", "I'd want to know if my boyfriend did that\n\n  \nShe did the right thing", "Then why does she need someone to stand there and guard her?", "Yes. Why does it seem american?", "It really does. I can't count the times I've changed with other people m/f present and I don't care to even try. It is not a sexual thing. I need to get out of bikini / sports gear / spa robe / something I spilled something on / other and into something else.\n\nAnd then back to regular scheduled content.", "Probably because if they were cheating they would just lie and say GF was cool with it.

Not like OP freaked out, unlike Gracie.", "This is exactly right. If she had concerns with the situation, the first person to talk to should be her own friend - not her friend's friend's girlfriend. (And on top of that, OP seems just slightly over worked up about nudity.)", "If she really wanted to know about why Gracie changed in front of him she should have pulled Gracie, her main friend side first and brought it up. Instead she tattled on them. What adult does that? Lol", "I love your comment! It perfectly describes what I wanted to say but couldn\u2019t find the words!", "They did it right out in the open... in the parking lot of the restaurant girlfriend was at. Clearly they're not trying to hide something...", "No, not when it\u2019s out in a parking lot and wet swim wear.", "Actually, most people would find it entirely appropriate in this situation", "Be honest about what? This had nothing to do with the girlfriend.  Besides, breasts are just for delivering milk, and the vagina is just for delivering babies.  Right, Reddit?", "I see only one dumbass. It is ok to be nude around a friend if both are ok with it,  stop making shit up", "If your partner is out cheating I hope nobody tells you", "Thank you. That was my point, but apparently they claim its pretty normal for surfers to change after a sesh. Im pretty new to this, but it didn't sound right to me.", "You have trust issues", "His girlfriend is 31, they have been together for 2 years.

Just in case, because a lot of people wouldn't be okay with it and she deserves to make that call.", "holy moly what an insane takeaway", "Not really", "Those people are too weird to hang out with anyways", "Exactly this. Elsewhere OP comments that they didn't ask Gracie because they think Gracie would lie since she's a \"boys girl\" and \"ride or die\".

But why *wouldn't* Leo's girlfriend then tell him", "OP is *Gracies* friend, no Leo\u2019s, not Leo\u2019s girlfriend. Yeah I\u2019d be pissed if my friend went behind my back to tell one of my friends\u2019 girlfriends\u2019 something like this without ever approaching me about it.", "If you don't think they're cheating why mention it, why not talk to Gracie first?", "yea, not so much. YTA - you don\u2019t think they are cheating, you don\u2019t know them very well or their dynamic,his GF isn\u2019t your bestie, but you still decided to interject yourself into a situation that no one seemed to appreciate and you still are being self righteous. get over yourself.", "It's just a pure shit move to go all in and trigger the self destruct button to your friendship and the relationship of your friends without even having talked to Gracie first.\n\nIf you didn't like the answers and thought you need to follow your morals afterwards, so be it.\n\nBut this was just so poor on so many levels, Id be surprised if any of the people involved would like to continue hanging out with you.", "Info: why did you choose to bring this up with Leo\u2019s gf and not your friend first? I\u2019d be pissed if my friend talked about me like this behind my back without approaching me at all.", "OP didn't really assume anything. She brought up something that seemed weird. This guy in a relationship who's a decade older than her friend is watching her change. He's old enough to pretend it's so normal it's NBD. She's young enough to believe him. Friend just got weird enough vibes from it all. Definitely NTA on her part", "But they're not", ">giving peep shows is not normal.\n\nIn the US you might be right, it's rather unusual (but in no way problematic!).\n\nI've stayed at >100 hostels all over Europe and people, including women, changing in front of other guests regularly happens.\n\n>it would be disgusting to get naked in front of my older brother or really any man whatsoever that I wasn't dating\n\nThat's sad.

There's nothing disgusting about your body.", "To stop strangers from seeing her without her consent", "We can be very puritan when it comes to nudity.", "Americans get weird about any nudity.", "Because Americans are way more hung up on nudity and the sexualization of it then say European countries.", "Because, fairly or unfairly, Americans have a reputation for sexualising nudity when there's nothing inherently sexual about it and accusing all men of being perverts. Not saying that's how Americans actually are, but there's a perception that they are (probably because of ridiculous behaviours like yours).", "I've hid lots of things.  Know the best place to do that?  In plain sight.", "Closing the car door and the friend looking out for people, yes. That would have been perfectly normal.

You don't just jump to conclusions.

I'd challenge all of the Y-T-A commenters to consider how they'd feel if there SO was naked in front of someone of the opposite sex who they see regularly.", "[deleted]", "Yeah, tell yourself that.", "Personally, if someone were looking out for me in that manner it would feel like selling them out a bit? Unless you can trust it to stay between you and your partner, which it clearly didn\u2019t. Maybe she (girlfriend) just thought it was funny but it\u2019s just like dang, that girl (OP) was just trying to look out for you.", "What\u2019s there to talk about? How would that conversation even go?", "I think with how they acted they will eventually start hooking up, so i wanted to give the gf a heads up. Gracie is a \"boys girl\", she would ride and die for Leo without second thought of his gf, so I dont feel as though she would be completely honest if i asked her.", "But it\u2019s supposed to be common according to this person?", "Do you think the above scenario is normal then?", "Exactly.", "Your preference, and as a man I can say that seeing a woman nude can be a-okay. Unlike what most people think men aren't sex machines that only think about sex. But if I see a best female friend naked in front of me I think oh my friend is nude....ok", "Not exactly, more so she was inbetween the car doors and he was shielding her body. So it was the doors on each side, and then Leo and the car on the other sides making a square around Gracie.", "She doesn't know if his partner would have an issue, most people go by \"Do what you'd want others to do\" if this happened, i'd want someone to tell me.

That much is obvious.", "You have never had a close platonic  opposite  sex relationship  and it shows.

I don't care if my fellow scubadivers see me, I do care if people who I don't know see me changing. Big difference!", "Yeah I know what you're talking about. Still not weird. Esp since the gf didn't have an issue with it."]}
