I was annoyed, but these things happen, I thought. \n\nI went for a little walk to pass the time and arrived 20 minutes later. When I arrived, I told the owner of the salon my name and appointment time. She looked up and said \u201ctake a seat.\u201d I was a bit annoyed she didn\u2019t apologise for the 20 minute wait she gave me 5 minutes notice of. \n\nThen another nail tech came over, she gave me a look and took my hands. No smile, no hello. She didn\u2019t speak English so the salon owner asked what I wanted on my nails. I explained I\u2019d like some French tips. She rudely said \u201cdid you book that as an extra online? That takes extra time to do. You\u2019ll have to pay extra.\u201d \n\nI agreed, and the nail tech started doing my nails. She hurt me with the file and when I said \u201cow\u201d and pulled my hand back she shook her head, as if I was being dramatic. \n\nThe salon owner then told her she was doing it incorrectly and did not have the nail file on a fast enough setting. At this point I\u2019d had enough and I asked to leave. I told the owner it had been a really bad experience to have to wait 20 minutes with no apology, to have been hurt by the nail file and to have had the nail tech shake her head at me. \n\nThe owner apologised and said she would take over and do my nails but I told her I would just rather leave. She offered again but by this point I was feeling a bit upset and embarrassed so I told her I just wanted to go. \n\nIt was a really unpleasant experience but now I\u2019m wondering if I overreacted.
