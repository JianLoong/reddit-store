Their engagement party was basically a dinner with friends and close relatives, and my sister went all out on the food. To her marriage is a huge deal, and she's had her whole wedding and married life planned out since we were kids. I've never felt the same excitement for weddings and kids and such things, even though i do want it at some point, and since I'm a lesbian in an homophobic family, i long ago accepted that a big fancy wedding with my father walking me down the aisle isn't part of the plan. This doesn't sadden me much, but my sister (who's the only one in my family who know about my sexuality) has been convinced that I'm jealous of her since she started dating her fianc\u00e9. \n\nThe dinner started out great, but after the main course, my family and relatives started asking about my dating life. It was pretty harmless questions at first, such as \"when are you getting a boyfriend?\" and \"why aren't you dating? I saw that boy hitting on you just yesterday!\" It annoyed me, but my sister seemed even more annoyed. After dessert, when the alcohol started kicking in, the questions got a little out of hand. My mom said \"I can't believe your sister got engaged first, you've always been more social!\" and my grandma commented on that I was \"the more attractive sister\". My sister obviously got hurt by this, and I caught her crying in the bathroom at one point. I tried to talk to her, but all she said was \"Happy? You've made my engagement allt about you.\" and then avoided me for the rest of the party.\n\nSo this is the part where i might have been the bad guy. After my aunt asked when I would get a boyfriend for the millionth time, and I'd had my millionth glass of wine, I told her that I'd never get a boyfriend, but when I got a girlfriend she'd be the first to know. I then stormed out of the apartment, accidentally knocking a glass over, and took a cab home. My phone immediately started blowing up, but i turned notifications off and went straight to bed. One of me and my sisters mutual friend, who was on the party, told me the next day that a wild discussion about what I said to my aunt was held and then the party cut short, my sister locked herself in her room crying and everyone went home. I have now been blocked my most of my family and relatives, my sister sent me a nasty next about how me coming out on her part stole her thunder, and my mother no longer considers me family. \n\nI'm not gonna try to make up excuses for my behavior, because I definitely could have been a more supporting sister, but I just wanted to know, AITA?", "created_utc": 1685796540, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13zbw2s/aita_for_stealing_my_sisters_thunder_on_her/", "score": 776, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why can't you all be happy for my sister, who is engaged and looking beautiful?\"\n\nIt's looking like you might be the favoured younger child, and you've not done anything to call that out before. ESH I really feel bad for your sister, imagine being called the unattractive sibling at your engagement party and have everyone prioritise your single sisters potential future engagement over your own.", "ESH \nLet me explain. It isn\u2019t YOUR fault you were asked questions. Period. The relatives kept saying stuff that was 1) Taking the shine off of your sister 2) Bringing up your dating status.\nI wish you would have 1) Quit drinking when you were getting interrogated 2) Left earlier\nI wish you would have come out at a later date, OR better still a long time ago, Dear.\nLife is short.", "NAH, your sister and you both deserved better. Your family was being a bunch of AH both to her and to you. \n\nThings were already going sideways before you came out. You shouldn\u2019t need to hide who you are and although there may have been a better time for it (ok\u2014well, like, maybe) it sounds like you were completely pressured into it.", "NTA You weren\u2019t the one making it all about you, your family was. Who the fuck says that someone is more attractive than someone else right in front of the person?", "ESH.\n\nThere are a bunch of homophobic assholes.\n\nYou shouldn't have made a scene, and you shouldn't have been drinking.\n\nThat was not the place nor the time to come out.", "ESH\n\n Them for being intrusive and their comments about you being the prettier sister. \n\n Your sister for blaming you for their questioning. \n\n A very very very little you for chosing this party to come out. I love your answer to aunt, but maybe this party wasn't the place for it. \n\n And the worst of all assholes is your mother. I  don't have kids, but i can't imagine turning my back on my kid just because they're gay.", "NTA. Your family bullied you into your outburst. Ideally you wouldn\u2019t have caved to that pressure on your sister\u2019s engagement party but a person can only take so much so I really don\u2019t blame you. Your family sound awful. That \u201cprettier sister\u201d remark is unforgivable.", "I\u2019m going to go against most of the grain here and say, NTA. You sister was pissed off at you, before you even came out. She was mad at YOU and saying YOU were making it about yourself, when that was not true AT ALL. People were harassing you, that is NOT your fault. The FAMILY was making it about you, you were not. While you should not have come out at her engagement party, the timing was really poor, she was already super pissed at you anyway and I understand the anger of why you snapped.", "NTA. You were pushed  by your family into deliver a reaction you never intended in the first place. Your familiy are the big assholes here. Your sister unfortunately is another victim because of this, but she then became an asshole too by choosing not to undersstand that your family was at fault, and started blaming you. I'd advice you to cut ties with your family because you would never be at peace with your life and yourself, just chase your happiness, and love whoever you want to love. Your family is not realy your family if they don't love and support you. I know it's not easy, but don't you dare think that you are any bit at fault. Go on, don't let yourself , your peace, your future and your happiness be affected by this. GOOD LUCK", "I don't think it was your fault that the family was grilling you about your personal life over dinner. I think almost every example I've read on reddit where the OP said something after drinking too much, I end up thinking they are the AH. In this case, I would go with ESH - except for the sister. She should not have blamed you for the early discussion, but she otherwise was just trying to enjoy a big moment in her life. Her family did not allow her to do so.", "NTA - I'm not sure how you could've stopped them being more interested in you than in your sister... You can't help it that they're calling you prettier on her engagement party.", "NTA and neither is your sister. You're both victims of shitty family dynamics. You snapped, it happens and usually happens in high pressure/intense situations; this definitely fits the bill. All night trying to deflect obnoxious comments that effectively erase your identity while your sister blames you instead of the family? Of course you lost it and made an impulsive choice. \n\nAfter things calm down a bit, maybe try to explain to your sister what it's like to be trapped in the closet. That it sucks the family kept making her feel like shit, but most of those same comments made you feel ironically invisible and trapped. Admit that part of you is a little jealous because she doesn't have to hide a major part of her identity and you know her marriage is accepted while your potential future marriage to a woman wouldn't be, but that it doesn't mean you aren't happy for her or wish she didn't have the blessings she has.\n\nHopefully your sister can realize your parents and family are the enemy and you and she are the allies you both need. Good luck.", "Easy NTA and I'm sorry this happened to you. Im sure this isn't how you wanted to come out. You're the only not asshole here. \n\nYour sister sucks. It's OK for her to he annoyed about what happened at her party but that was your family not you. You both were the victim but she took it out on you. Your family entirely sucks.", "man these judgments are absolutely bullshit. you endured endless pestering from asshole family at a party that should have been about your sister, then had said sister act like you were the problem  and somehow *your* the bad guy because you had enough of all the bullshit? fuck. that. hard NTA and shame on reddit for acting otherwise. you're better off without the lot of them, including your sister, cause she was completely out of line to berate you for the rest of the family being assholes.", "Honestly ima say NTA. I can see you freaking out and storming off. Fuck your family.", "Fuck em.\n\nLive your life!", "Sorry your family sucks", "ESH. Your family of course for bringing up your life at all much less harping on it. You for not being an adult and knowing you needed to leave before you snapped.", "ESH. \n\nYour sister isn\u2019t right for taking it out on you but this was a huge deal to her and I understand her being really upset. \n\nYour family shouldn\u2019t have pressed you so hard but I also understand where they were coming from as they are curious about your love life especially since you have never brought anyone around before. Since they didn\u2019t know you were closeted they didn\u2019t know that they were pressing on a really sensitive subject.\n\nThe grandma who called you the attractive sister should be excommunicated. \n\nThe situation did really suck for you but coming out at your sister\u2019s thing wasn\u2019t the right time or place. You already knew she was upset and had been crying and you should have supported her more on that day. \n\nAlso OP please consider that having your sister be the sole keeper of your secret has likely been hard on her. It takes conscious effort to not let that secret come out accidentally during conversation. It also creates anxiety as your sister probably worries about how your family will react when they do find out. She likely regularly sees or hears them making comments about you and she can\u2019t freely explain or have a conversation about you because she can\u2019t let it slip. It takes a lot of mental effort to police your words. While the secret is yours and your choice when to share and to who, sharing on your sister\u2019s day when it was going downhill instead of trying to get the party back on track for her was not the best call IMO.", "ESH, except your sister.\n\nYour family sucks for making the party about questioning you, and for being a bunch of homophobes.\n\nYou suck for getting drunk and coming out at your sister's engagement party.", "You could've just left.

YTA", "YTA and so is your family. \n\nYou came out to the entire family at HER engagement party, you should\u2019ve waited until it was appropriate.

Although you can\u2019t control your families comments and how they were acting, it also doesn\u2019t sound like you tried to calmly and rationally put an end to the comments that were being made until you decided to blow up and come out. Your sister was the only one that knew, she kept your secret, and this is how you repay her? Kind of sounds like you are jealous of her because you\u2019ll never get the same support with the wedding festivities. That doesn\u2019t mean you have to ruin hers though.\n\nThe rest of your family also sounds like a bunch of toxic assholes, which is why ESH.", "ESH.  Sounds like everyone had way too much to drink.  Something to think about.", "NTA", "NTA, but your family (excluding your sister) sure is.", "NTA", "Sounds like you were pushed past your limit, felt trapped, and a bit drunk, and decided without deciding that it was time to be honest about who you are.\n\nYour sister may have a bad couple of days over not being the center of attention for this big event. But your reality is that you have no idea if your family will EVER be supportive, much less excited, for all the big days to come in your own life.\n\nComing out is not always at the perfect time, and that's the fault of homophobes, not people who just want to live their life and be who they are.\n\nNTA", "NTA, your family kinda sucks though tbh", "This sounds unrealistic. If it happened the way you're saying it happened then you literally said and did NOTHING for half an hour to an hour while being CONSTANTLY focused on by half your family despite repeated attempts to demur their attention.\n\nAnd for it to go so far as to make your sister break down crying in the bathroom with you not having said word one? What extreme melodrama.\n\nSo major NTA.\n\nBut I've never seen that kind of social dynamic play out so I *suspect* that you either siad or did more than you realize or than you're writing here. As written, this would be a bad sitcom moment.", "Here's the response that should've been given: \"we're here for sister's engagement, we can talk about me another time.\" Repeated at nauseam. ESH", "ESH, wow", "You were N T A until you decided to out yourself then and there.\n\n\nThat made you squarely an AH, so ESH. I give your sister a nta as she couldn't help having to deal with your family pretty much ignoring her and tearing her down.", "ESH, you for drinking too much and selfishly ruining the party, your sister a bit of an AH when she was blaming you earlier, but you proved her right later, your mom and grandma are pretty massive assholes for saying those things in your sister's presence but you are the biggest AH, especially when you already knew your sister was upset about you", "Ahhh it\u2019s pride month so gotta start making shit posts about gay people\u2026.", "Well yes, and no.   \n\nYour family were aholes for not letting your romantic life drop, and for placing you above your sister. They absolutely started it and frankly that party was a mess before you came out. \n\nClear headed you would probably have done well to stop drinking, make your excuses and leave right then. \n\nSadly that is not what happened, and regardless of how you got to that point announcing anything at someone else\u2019s significant event or party makes you the asshole. \n\nSo yea, YTA.

Your family is absolute AH for pressuring you with constant questions and especially with the nasty remark that you're the more attractive sister. They tore the attention from your sister to you, and it's ridiculous to blame you for it, as your sister did.\n\nAbout coming out and getting drunk, I cannot blame you that it happened as it happened. Who would stand family's interrogation sober? When you try to stay at the party and not make a scene, show your support to your sister as well as you can -she just didn't want to receive it. I also understand snapping and wanting to put an end to the constant questioning that must have got incredibly stressful, drunken or not. \n\nYou did not ruin the party. It was ruined by your family long ago you came out.

Maybe one day you'll find a girlfriend and a family that accepts you.", "This is tough one because, on the surface, coming out at your sisters engagement party should make you TA, but you were kind of goaded and pushed into it. I DO feel like you maybe should\u2019ve said something about how it\u2019s your sisters day so the focus should be on her, not you. You also probably should\u2019ve either held your tongue or made up an excuse to leave early. I\u2019m going to go with ESH. \n\nI\u2019m sorry your family are a bunch of AHs. Bugging you a little would be ridiculous enough but to say that you\u2019re the prettier one or to make anything about you on a day that was meant to be celebrating your sister and her fianc\u00e9 is just outrageous. \n\nApologize and make sure your sister knows you feel bad but you were also backed into a corner and it just sorta came out.", "NTA. \nNot your fault for being born into a homophobic family where you can\u2019t be yourself.

The only person you need to apologize to is your sister and I would work on that ASAP.", "Awww, you stole your sisters thunder long before your drunk admission about getting a GF.

Their engagement party was basically a dinner with friends and close relatives, and my sister went all out on the food. To her marriage is a huge deal, and she's had her whole wedding and married life planned out since we were kids. I've never felt the same excitement for weddings and kids and such things, even though i do want it at some point, and since I'm a lesbian in an homophobic family, i long ago accepted that a big fancy wedding with my father walking me down the aisle isn't part of the plan. This doesn't sadden me much, but my sister (who's the only one in my family who know about my sexuality) has been convinced that I'm jealous of her since she started dating her fianc\u00e9. \n\nThe dinner started out great, but after the main course, my family and relatives started asking about my dating life. It was pretty harmless questions at first, such as \"when are you getting a boyfriend?\" and \"why aren't you dating? I saw that boy hitting on you just yesterday!\" It annoyed me, but my sister seemed even more annoyed. After dessert, when the alcohol started kicking in, the questions got a little out of hand. My mom said \"I can't believe your sister got engaged first, you've always been more social!\" and my grandma commented on that I was \"the more attractive sister\". My sister obviously got hurt by this, and I caught her crying in the bathroom at one point. I tried to talk to her, but all she said was \"Happy? You've made my engagement allt about you.\" and then avoided me for the rest of the party.\n\nSo this is the part where i might have been the bad guy. After my aunt asked when I would get a boyfriend for the millionth time, and I'd had my millionth glass of wine, I told her that I'd never get a boyfriend, but when I got a girlfriend she'd be the first to know. I then stormed out of the apartment, accidentally knocking a glass over, and took a cab home. My phone immediately started blowing up, but i turned notifications off and went straight to bed. One of me and my sisters mutual friend, who was on the party, told me the next day that a wild discussion about what I said to my aunt was held and then the party cut short, my sister locked herself in her room crying and everyone went home. I have now been blocked my most of my family and relatives, my sister sent me a nasty next about how me coming out on her part stole her thunder, and my mother no longer considers me family. \n\nI'm not gonna try to make up excuses for my behavior, because I definitely could have been a more supporting sister, but I just wanted to know, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I understand she was exaggerating, but when she says she was asked for the millionth time, I'm taking that as she was asked MANY times.", "Oh, absolutely, the sister is out of everyone the least bit of an AH. Op could have absolutely tried to shut things down. However, by the sounds of it, the family wouldn't have let it go, and the result would have been the same. Op also said that her sister seems to have the idea that she is jealous of her engagement, so pretty much anything Op did was gonna be wrong. The only thing the sister did was wrong was to completely blame  Op for the first bit.. Op doubling down and using it as an excuse to come out and ACTUALLY ruin the party is what makes her an AH. Up until then, she was fine.\n\nI 100% agree that they ow her an apology, though.", "I completely agree, OP is not an AH for the family\u2019s questioning, the family is. I agree they wouldn\u2019t have let it go but it wouldn\u2019t by any means have exactly \u201cruined\u201d the engagement. \n\nOP said that her sister has the idea she\u2019s \u201cjealous\u201d about her *fianc\u00e9*, which info is needed because that doesn\u2019t add up in my head considering she\u2019s a lesbian and sister knew about that. \n\nI think everyone is really overplaying what her sister said to her. OP did not write how she responded to the family\u2019s questions. Her reaction doesn\u2019t sound great, but I wouldn\u2019t go as far as to say it makes her an AH at all. It sounds like her sister would have persevered through the night either way."]}
