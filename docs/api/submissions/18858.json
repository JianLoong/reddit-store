Their engagement party was basically a dinner with friends and close relatives, and my sister went all out on the food. To her marriage is a huge deal, and she's had her whole wedding and married life planned out since we were kids. I've never felt the same excitement for weddings and kids and such things, even though i do want it at some point, and since I'm a lesbian in an homophobic family, i long ago accepted that a big fancy wedding with my father walking me down the aisle isn't part of the plan. This doesn't sadden me much, but my sister (who's the only one in my family who know about my sexuality) has been convinced that I'm jealous of her since she started dating her fianc\u00e9. \n\nThe dinner started out great, but after the main course, my family and relatives started asking about my dating life. It was pretty harmless questions at first, such as \"when are you getting a boyfriend?\" and \"why aren't you dating? I saw that boy hitting on you just yesterday!\" It annoyed me, but my sister seemed even more annoyed. After dessert, when the alcohol started kicking in, the questions got a little out of hand. My mom said \"I can't believe your sister got engaged first, you've always been more social!\" and my grandma commented on that I was \"the more attractive sister\". My sister obviously got hurt by this, and I caught her crying in the bathroom at one point. I tried to talk to her, but all she said was \"Happy? You've made my engagement allt about you.\" and then avoided me for the rest of the party.\n\nSo this is the part where i might have been the bad guy. After my aunt asked when I would get a boyfriend for the millionth time, and I'd had my millionth glass of wine, I told her that I'd never get a boyfriend, but when I got a girlfriend she'd be the first to know. I then stormed out of the apartment, accidentally knocking a glass over, and took a cab home. My phone immediately started blowing up, but i turned notifications off and went straight to bed. One of me and my sisters mutual friend, who was on the party, told me the next day that a wild discussion about what I said to my aunt was held and then the party cut short, my sister locked herself in her room crying and everyone went home. I have now been blocked my most of my family and relatives, my sister sent me a nasty next about how me coming out on her part stole her thunder, and my mother no longer considers me family. \n\nI'm not gonna try to make up excuses for my behavior, because I definitely could have been a more supporting sister, but I just wanted to know, AITA?", "created_utc": 1685796540, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13zbw2s/aita_for_stealing_my_sisters_thunder_on_her/", "score": 8305, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why can't you all be happy for my sister, who is engaged and looking beautiful?\"\n\nIt's looking like you might be the favoured younger child, and you've not done anything to call that out before. ESH I really feel bad for your sister, imagine being called the unattractive sibling at your engagement party and have everyone prioritise your single sisters potential future engagement over your own actual engagement.", "ESH \nLet me explain. It isn\u2019t YOUR fault you were asked questions. Period. The relatives kept saying stuff that was 1) Taking the shine off of your sister 2) Bringing up your dating status.\nI wish you would have 1) Quit drinking when you were getting interrogated 2) Left earlier\nI wish you would have come out at a later date, OR better still a long time ago, Dear.\nLife is short. Edit: I want to edit this. I don\u2019t like ignoring people.\nThe young lady obviously has felt alienated from her family for a very long time. If it is religion, sexuality, or even politics, it is emotionally draining to live around this crap, let alone know your authentic self would be disowned by the people you should trust most in life.\nWeddings and engagements, baby showers like the trinity of \u201clet the focus be on whoever the event is for\u201d. If OP got badgered into saying she was an apostate, or a liberal, or whatever this \u201cfamily\u201d doesn\u2019t like, she was pushed. It wasn\u2019t her choice. \nIt is a dangerous time to be LGBTQ+ right now, and if she didn\u2019t want them to know, I am not sure this is the safe way to go. And yes, if someone is having to hide who they are, it has to suck. Many of us know people who have lived their whole lives for a family member, a religion, whatever. I personally think is has to feel like crap.", "NAH, your sister and you both deserved better. Your family was being a bunch of AH both to her and to you. \n\nThings were already going sideways before you came out. You shouldn\u2019t need to hide who you are and although there may have been a better time for it (ok\u2014well, like, maybe) it sounds like you were completely pressured into it.", "NTA You weren\u2019t the one making it all about you, your family was. Who the fuck says that someone is more attractive than someone else right in front of the person?", "ESH.\n\nThere are a bunch of homophobic assholes.\n\nYou shouldn't have made a scene, and you shouldn't have been drinking.\n\nThat was not the place nor the time to come out.\n\nEDIT : About the drinking, i think everybody at the party should not have been drinking. \n\nIt feels to me like they were pretty much all drunk and I think it's another family issue. OP should have known better. She knows how her family is and that the drinking was not going to help.\n\nAs OP did cause \u00e0 scene by leaving the way she did. She was drunk, knocked \u00e0 glass on the way out. That's making \u00e0 sc\u00e8ne.\n\nAnd someone commented that I should not tell someone when  or where to come out. That's true. And chances are, it would have been \u00e0 disaster no matter where and when, but the sister already had a shitty night and OP's announcement just made it worst.\n\nBy the sound of it, both sisters have suffered their fair share of emotionnal abuse from their familiy.", "ESH\n\n Them for being intrusive and their comments about you being the prettier sister. \n\n Your sister for blaming you for their questioning. \n\n A very very very little you for chosing this party to come out. I love your answer to aunt, but maybe this party wasn't the place for it. \n\n And the worst of all assholes is your mother. I  don't have kids, but i can't imagine turning my back on my kid just because they're gay.", "NTA. Your family bullied you into your outburst. Ideally you wouldn\u2019t have caved to that pressure on your sister\u2019s engagement party but a person can only take so much so I really don\u2019t blame you. Your family sound awful. That \u201cprettier sister\u201d remark is unforgivable.", "I\u2019m going to go against most of the grain here and say, NTA. You sister was pissed off at you, before you even came out. She was mad at YOU and saying YOU were making it about yourself, when that was not true AT ALL. People were harassing you, that is NOT your fault. The FAMILY was making it about you, you were not. While you should not have come out at her engagement party, the timing was really poor, she was already super pissed at you anyway and I understand the anger of why you snapped.", "NTA. You were pushed  by your family into deliver a reaction you never intended in the first place. Your familiy are the big assholes here. Your sister unfortunately is another victim because of this, but she then became an asshole too by choosing not to undersstand that your family was at fault, and started blaming you. I'd advice you to cut ties with your family because you would never be at peace with your life and yourself, just chase your happiness, and love whoever you want to love. Your family is not realy your family if they don't love and support you. I know it's not easy, but don't you dare think that you are any bit at fault. Go on, don't let yourself , your peace, your future and your happiness be affected by this. GOOD LUCK", "I don't think it was your fault that the family was grilling you about your personal life over dinner. I think almost every example I've read on reddit where the OP said something after drinking too much, I end up thinking they are the AH. In this case, I would go with ESH - except for the sister. She should not have blamed you for the early discussion, but she otherwise was just trying to enjoy a big moment in her life. Her family did not allow her to do so.", "NTA - I'm not sure how you could've stopped them being more interested in you than in your sister... You can't help it that they're calling you prettier on her engagement party.", "NTA and neither is your sister. You're both victims of shitty family dynamics. You snapped, it happens and usually happens in high pressure/intense situations; this definitely fits the bill. All night trying to deflect obnoxious comments that effectively erase your identity while your sister blames you instead of the family? Of course you lost it and made an impulsive choice. \n\nAfter things calm down a bit, maybe try to explain to your sister what it's like to be trapped in the closet. That it sucks the family kept making her feel like shit, but most of those same comments made you feel ironically invisible and trapped. Admit that part of you is a little jealous because she doesn't have to hide a major part of her identity and you know her marriage is accepted while your potential future marriage to a woman wouldn't be, but that it doesn't mean you aren't happy for her or wish she didn't have the blessings she has.\n\nHopefully your sister can realize your parents and family are the enemy and you and she are the allies you both need. Good luck.", "Easy NTA and I'm sorry this happened to you. Im sure this isn't how you wanted to come out. You're the only not asshole here. \n\nYour sister sucks. It's OK for her to he annoyed about what happened at her party but that was your family not you. You both were the victim but she took it out on you. Your family entirely sucks.", "man these judgments are absolutely bullshit. you endured endless pestering from asshole family at a party that should have been about your sister, then had said sister act like you were the problem  and somehow *your* the bad guy because you had enough of all the bullshit? fuck. that. hard NTA and shame on reddit for acting otherwise. you're better off without the lot of them, including your sister, cause she was completely out of line to berate you for the rest of the family being assholes.", "Honestly ima say NTA. I can see you freaking out and storming off. Fuck your family.", "Fuck em.\n\nLive your life!", "Sorry your family sucks", "ESH. Your family of course for bringing up your life at all much less harping on it. You for not being an adult and knowing you needed to leave before you snapped.", "ESH. \n\nYour sister isn\u2019t right for taking it out on you but this was a huge deal to her and I understand her being really upset. \n\nYour family shouldn\u2019t have pressed you so hard but I also understand where they were coming from as they are curious about your love life especially since you have never brought anyone around before. Since they didn\u2019t know you were closeted they didn\u2019t know that they were pressing on a really sensitive subject.\n\nThe grandma who called you the attractive sister should be excommunicated. \n\nThe situation did really suck for you but coming out at your sister\u2019s thing wasn\u2019t the right time or place. You already knew she was upset and had been crying and you should have supported her more on that day. \n\nAlso OP please consider that having your sister be the sole keeper of your secret has likely been hard on her. It takes conscious effort to not let that secret come out accidentally during conversation. It also creates anxiety as your sister probably worries about how your family will react when they do find out. She likely regularly sees or hears them making comments about you and she can\u2019t freely explain or have a conversation about you because she can\u2019t let it slip. It takes a lot of mental effort to police your words. While the secret is yours and your choice when to share and to who, sharing on your sister\u2019s day when it was going downhill instead of trying to get the party back on track for her was not the best call IMO.", "ESH, except your sister.\n\nYour family sucks for making the party about questioning you, and for being a bunch of homophobes.\n\nYou suck for getting drunk and coming out at your sister's engagement party.", "You could've just left.

YTA", "YTA and so is your family. \n\nYou came out to the entire family at HER engagement party, you should\u2019ve waited until it was appropriate.

Although you can\u2019t control your families comments and how they were acting, it also doesn\u2019t sound like you tried to calmly and rationally put an end to the comments that were being made until you decided to blow up and come out. Your sister was the only one that knew, she kept your secret, and this is how you repay her? Kind of sounds like you are jealous of her because you\u2019ll never get the same support with the wedding festivities. That doesn\u2019t mean you have to ruin hers though.\n\nThe rest of your family also sounds like a bunch of toxic assholes, which is why ESH.", "ESH.  Sounds like everyone had way too much to drink.  Something to think about.", "NTA", "NTA, but your family (excluding your sister) sure is.", "NTA", "Sounds like you were pushed past your limit, felt trapped, and a bit drunk, and decided without deciding that it was time to be honest about who you are.\n\nYour sister may have a bad couple of days over not being the center of attention for this big event. But your reality is that you have no idea if your family will EVER be supportive, much less excited, for all the big days to come in your own life.\n\nComing out is not always at the perfect time, and that's the fault of homophobes, not people who just want to live their life and be who they are.\n\nNTA", "NTA, your family kinda sucks though tbh", "This sounds unrealistic. If it happened the way you're saying it happened then you literally said and did NOTHING for half an hour to an hour while being CONSTANTLY focused on by half your family despite repeated attempts to demur their attention.\n\nAnd for it to go so far as to make your sister break down crying in the bathroom with you not having said word one? What extreme melodrama.\n\nSo major NTA.\n\nBut I've never seen that kind of social dynamic play out so I *suspect* that you either siad or did more than you realize or than you're writing here. As written, this would be a bad sitcom moment.", "Here's the response that should've been given: \"we're here for sister's engagement, we can talk about me another time.\" Repeated at nauseam.

They tore the attention from your sister to you, and it's ridiculous to blame you for it, as your sister did.\n\nAbout coming out and getting drunk, I cannot blame you that it happened as it happened. Who would stand family's interrogation sober? When you try to stay at the party and not make a scene, show your support to your sister as well as you can -she just didn't want to receive it. I also understand snapping and wanting to put an end to the constant questioning that must have got incredibly stressful, drunken or not. \n\nYou did not ruin the party.

I DO feel like you maybe should\u2019ve said something about how it\u2019s your sisters day so the focus should be on her, not you.

You should have stayed sober and just walked out when the grilling was ramping up and rose above your ridiculous family.  Not that you shouldn't feel free to be out and yourself but getting drunk,making a loud declaration, breaking dishes, and storming out isn't real mature.\n\nHonestly, maybe time to go no contact with these dysfunctional weirdos for a while and get yourself some therapy.

Their engagement party was basically a dinner with friends and close relatives, and my sister went all out on the food. To her marriage is a huge deal, and she's had her whole wedding and married life planned out since we were kids. I've never felt the same excitement for weddings and kids and such things, even though i do want it at some point, and since I'm a lesbian in an homophobic family, i long ago accepted that a big fancy wedding with my father walking me down the aisle isn't part of the plan. This doesn't sadden me much, but my sister (who's the only one in my family who know about my sexuality) has been convinced that I'm jealous of her since she started dating her fianc\u00e9. \n\nThe dinner started out great, but after the main course, my family and relatives started asking about my dating life. It was pretty harmless questions at first, such as \"when are you getting a boyfriend?\" and \"why aren't you dating? I saw that boy hitting on you just yesterday!\" It annoyed me, but my sister seemed even more annoyed. After dessert, when the alcohol started kicking in, the questions got a little out of hand. My mom said \"I can't believe your sister got engaged first, you've always been more social!\" and my grandma commented on that I was \"the more attractive sister\". My sister obviously got hurt by this, and I caught her crying in the bathroom at one point. I tried to talk to her, but all she said was \"Happy? You've made my engagement allt about you.\" and then avoided me for the rest of the party.\n\nSo this is the part where i might have been the bad guy. After my aunt asked when I would get a boyfriend for the millionth time, and I'd had my millionth glass of wine, I told her that I'd never get a boyfriend, but when I got a girlfriend she'd be the first to know. I then stormed out of the apartment, accidentally knocking a glass over, and took a cab home. My phone immediately started blowing up, but i turned notifications off and went straight to bed. One of me and my sisters mutual friend, who was on the party, told me the next day that a wild discussion about what I said to my aunt was held and then the party cut short, my sister locked herself in her room crying and everyone went home. I have now been blocked my most of my family and relatives, my sister sent me a nasty next about how me coming out on her part stole her thunder, and my mother no longer considers me family. \n\nI'm not gonna try to make up excuses for my behavior, because I definitely could have been a more supporting sister, but I just wanted to know, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I can't imagine they truly loved the OP (or any other LGBTQ+ person) in the first place if their reaction to this is permanently cutting them out. I love my own family and the only way I can imagine disowning one of my sisters was if one of them committed premeditated murder or started torturing animals or something.

It's a pooled product, but fewer people got HIV from cryo versus whole blood or plasma.  I say that he probably got cryoprecipitate because the evolution of treatment for hemophiliacs was: Whole blood, which had a whole host of issues; plasma, which did the same thing with less volume and somewhat fewer issues; then cryoprecipitate, which had a fraction of the volume of plasma and very few issues; then factor, which was ridiculously specific for the type of hemophilia, and thus more useful for treating the disease.\n\nWhole blood has very little clotting factor but is better than nothing.  Plasma has very little clotting factor, but one unit of plasma is much, much smaller than a unit of whole blood, so you can be given more plasma.  Cryoprecipitate is what you get if you take plasma and cool it to almost freezing (it looks like a snowglobe as it all \"precipitates\" out); what collects is clotting factors.  This is collected with a bit of plasma (think 15mL of liquid, total), and you can take several of these and pool them together for more factor and far less volume than plasma.  If you took cryoprcipitate and fractionated it - literally, separated out the individual types of clotting factors - in cryoprecipitate, and then did this same thing to a bunch of units worth of factor derived from a whole lot of plasma, then you could create a pure version of an individual factor.  Using factor is so much more efficient than using any other product mentioned so far.\n\nAs an aside, the plasma doesn't get thrown out after cryoprecipitate or factor is removed from it; it gets processed down into human albumin, which is given (mostly but not exclusively) to people with liver issues.", "That was the first gay movie I saw as a tiny gay person.

You're not the asshole here, and you're probably the one who comes off the best out of all of everyone. Both your sister and your family are in the wrong.", "Ehhhh... justified asshole.\n\nNTA", "So you were pushed to the point of breaking\u2026 no you\u2019re NTA. Sister can change the subject, sister can get pissed at the people asking the questions. You\u2019re just THERE being patronized. And now you\u2019re not even considered family.. ridiculous. Sorry your family is so homophobic.", "This is the best AITA ever. So much stuff that has already been on a simmer for years suddenly gets dumped into a pressure cooker and ka-boom. \n\nI don't think you're the asshole \u2014 or maybe it's that you are one many slices of asshole.   \n\u2022 NTA Repressing and disguising yourself for years in front of family is \\*work\\*. I'm gay, I used to get all the same questions you did. That lid had to blow off, so it is not surprising that it did in this context.   \n\u2022 YTA Growing up in the shadow of an older straight sibling who revels in straight life is hard, too, and sisterly relationships can be brutal. She says you're jealous \u2014 she might be right. But people act like jealousy is wrong, that it's not ok, and try to shame you with it \u2014 when it's as natural and predictable as being happy or angry. I would be jealous of all that if I were you, so what if you were? All that means is that it really turned up the heat on a situation that was gonna explode.  \n\n\nSo all told I think you're generally 9/10 NTA and 1/10 YTA, but you are my kind of asshole. Oh that sounds weird. Ew. Ignore.", "NTA. Your sister is a *little bit* of the TA, but your family is ALL of it. Your sister was being insulted and intentionally overshadowed at an event about her. Not by you, but it was still happening. I'm assuming this isn't the first time comments like these have happened. It takes a toll and when family pits siblings against each other, it's bound to cause resentment. This isn't either of your doing, but your rude and insensitive family (so shocked that they're homophobes too!).\n\nI know everything that happened was really upsetting for her, but she has to see you did not invite or want these comments. Obviously, as you hadn't come out, why the hell would you want the attention on you like that? It's the opposite of what you would need to stay \"hidden.\"\n\nI suggest you have a calm and open conversation with your sister. Tell her that you didn't want to ruin her party but it wasn't you who ruined it. You didn't make those comments, you didn't decide to shun a family member over who they love. You didn't plan on coming out, it happened in the heat of the moment while being badgered repeatedly. And as a result, you're now no longer considered family. She had a party ruined, which absolutely sucks, but you have a family ruined. \n\nIt's obvious your family aren't nice people in general. I don't know if there's hope of reconciliation, if you think they can open their minds possibly. But for now, I am sorry about how they have reacted to your truth. Everyone deserves to be themselves and love who they love. I hope you have others to lean on while getting through this.\n\nHopefully you can mend things with your sister. Tbh, she shouldn't be around your family while they're so willing to fling around mean-spirited remarks without care. They sound super toxic and she shouldn't be listening to them at all.", "Honestly this whole thing about stealing the thunder/spotlight is new to me. I'm a gen Xer so maybe that's why I am clueless. But until Reddit, I didn't know that when someone has a party/wedding/shower, all focus must be on the \"honoree\" and everyone else must dress down, remove flashy jewelry, hide pregnancies, disguise weight loss, and keep all manner of conversation on the honoree. If someone asks about your job? Don't you dare mention a promotion! Stealing the spotlight! If someone is getting married? Hide your own engagement ring! Stealing the spotlight! 4 months pregnant? Wear a baggy shirt and keep your mouth shut! Stealing the spotlight! If you are forced out of the closet by an annoying family who won't stop badgering?! Stealing the spotlight! Honestly, it's exhausting. My wedding, a friend I hadn't seen in months showed up pregnant. I was delighted! Someone else was newly engaged. We were thrilled for them! I cannot imagine throwing a fit. If someone \"came out\" at my party, who cares? What does that have to do with \"my spotlight\"?! And who are all these people who need a spotlight?? Is that brain damage from so much social media that you think every event is your Kardashian red carpet and the paparazzi better be 100% focused on you??? Please help me understand. Edit to add: NTA", "You aren't to blame for being bombarded with intrusive questions. I can understand the snappy comebacks too. No doubt it has been extremely difficult living in a toxically homophobic family and having to keep a part of yourself hidden to avoid being, at the very least, verbally assaulted by people who very much conditionally love you. You probably should have opted out at some point during the questioning. You could have pulled your sister aside and explained the situation before leaving. \n\nI cannot, in good conscience, see fit to blame you for your reaction to someone else's hatred and bullying. Your family was bullying you. Your sister's anger, quite frankly, is misplaced. You're an easy scapegoat. I can't help but wonder if your sister is a little jealous and homophobic herself. I'm sorry you have to deal with this shit. NTA.", "OP is NTA and her entire family sucks including her sister. I\u2019m sorry her party was ruined, but instead of helping her sister out by telling her family to stop, she called her sister an AH???? Where is the logic in that!!? And then to get mad at OP for defending herself \u2026 I agree she left quite hastily (and for those saying about the spilled drink, she literally said in her post that it was an **accident**. Stop making it look like she threw/pushed over the glass to make a worse scene. You\u2019re making shit up), but I would too if my asshole family was harassing me about my personal life. I also saw their questions as trying to make OP feel bad for not being \u201cfirst\u201d even though the oldest is the first one a lot of the time .. \ud83e\udd28\ud83e\udd28 \n\nI also do not like the victim blaming that is going on in these comments:\n-\u201cyou shouldn\u2019t have come out like that.\u201d HOW ABOUT HER FAMILY SHOULDNT HAVE BULLIED HER INTO IT? If she hadn\u2019t said that, no way they would\u2019ve stopped. OP probably tried to make them stop all night (I know there\u2019s no direct proof of this, but use a little common sense, eh?). It\u2019s so easy to tell someone to just \u201cignore them\u201d etc, but you have NO IDEA how upsetting and overwhelming it can be when a person won\u2019t stop harassing you no matter how bad you\u2019ve begged them (to that end, a lot of you haven\u2019t ever been bullied and it shows).\n\n-\u201cyou shouldn\u2019t have been drinking.\u201d This REEKS of SA victim blaming \u2014 \u201cwell how much did you have to drink/what were you wearing that night?\u201d Seriously? No way y\u2019all are looking for excuses for the family here (follow the logic. By saying OP was wrong for drinking, you\u2019re implying that if she hadn\u2019t been, they wouldn\u2019t have bullied her, which is bullshit. Sure, maybe she wouldn\u2019t have had THAT outburst, but she probably would\u2019ve snapped at some point because, again, no way they were planning to stop). \n\n-\u201cyou should\u2019ve just ignored them/tried to diffuse the situation.\u201d You guys are assuming she didn\u2019t try. Plus it\u2019s not like she had backup \u2014 her sister was more invested in villainizing her  than she was in helping end the conflict. Clearly her telling them to stop on her own wasn\u2019t working, so without backup, it certainly wouldn\u2019t. (Tbh I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if her sister is a little prejudiced too. I\u2019m not sure why, I just have that feeling. And I hope it\u2019s wrong).\n\n\nDownvote me if that\u2019s what you want, but I don\u2019t think OP is wrong for defending herself, especially since nobody else was interested in doing so. If you\u2019ve never had an invasive, judgmental, nosy family, you don\u2019t realize how bad they can get and how hard it is to make them stop. And the gaslighting! I\u2019m sure they made OP feel like she was overreacting even though her reaction to unsolicited questions and comments was/is perfectly normal. \nI think OP should sit down with her sister and clear everything out. She should apologize for how things went down (since they ruined the party), but I also think it\u2019s worth asking her sister why she didn\u2019t defend her and why she was so hellbent on the idea that OP was causing the issue on purpose. That\u2019s hurtful. \nDepending on how that conversation goes \u2026 contact may need to be modified or ceased completely .. \n\nBottom line, poke the bear a few times you might get lucky, but when the one time comes that the bear has had enough and eviscerates your stupid ass \u2026 you deserve that shit too.", "NTA. Why are people so damn annoying about engagement parties anyways? My thunder, your thunder...who the hell cares. You found someone to marry, okay great. Now relax, have a nice time, let everyone be themselves and get the hell over yourself.", "Amazing that you're calling a lesbian an asshole for being harassed and hounded into coming out", "NTA.\nKnocking a glass over isn\u2019t making a scene (and people regularly do it even if not drinking at all).\n\nSo they were drunk and that\u2019s maybe why she finally gathered strength to say it. I am proud of her! Very much.\n\nAnd about \u201ccoming out\u201d. I would maybe feel it somewhat similar years ago, raised and living in rather queer ignorant/homophobic country. But after living in a country where coming out isn\u2019t even a thing, really (Iceland), I am just tired of the idea that queer people have to \u201ccome out\u201d and plan it. People shouldn\u2019t be expected to do it and it\u2019s about time we stop making queer people tiptoeing around homophobic people.", "Ah yes the classic, \"it's abuse victims' responsibility to defend their siblings from abuse\" argument. Also, how do yo expect that to go? Can you feasibly see this resolving without this devolving into a huge fight? Either way she has \"ruined the night\" Her sister blamed her for \"making the party all about you\" just from simply existing on the other end of her relatives' shitty behavior. If she picked a fight that would have only her role in making the night \"all about her\" even more overt.", "Given the behavior of her relatives in this story, in what universe do you think OP could call out their behavior without it escalating into a huge fight in which she also would be blamed for \"ruining the night?\" Her sister blamed her for \"making the party all about you\" just from simply existing on the other end of her relatives' shitty behavior.
