Their engagement party was basically a dinner with friends and close relatives, and my sister went all out on the food. To her marriage is a huge deal, and she's had her whole wedding and married life planned out since we were kids. I've never felt the same excitement for weddings and kids and such things, even though i do want it at some point, and since I'm a lesbian in an homophobic family, i long ago accepted that a big fancy wedding with my father walking me down the aisle isn't part of the plan. This doesn't sadden me much, but my sister (who's the only one in my family who know about my sexuality) has been convinced that I'm jealous of her since she started dating her fianc\u00e9. \n\nThe dinner started out great, but after the main course, my family and relatives started asking about my dating life. It was pretty harmless questions at first, such as \"when are you getting a boyfriend?\" and \"why aren't you dating? I saw that boy hitting on you just yesterday!\" It annoyed me, but my sister seemed even more annoyed. After dessert, when the alcohol started kicking in, the questions got a little out of hand. My mom said \"I can't believe your sister got engaged first, you've always been more social!\" and my grandma commented on that I was \"the more attractive sister\". My sister obviously got hurt by this, and I caught her crying in the bathroom at one point. I tried to talk to her, but all she said was \"Happy? You've made my engagement allt about you.\" and then avoided me for the rest of the party.\n\nSo this is the part where i might have been the bad guy. After my aunt asked when I would get a boyfriend for the millionth time, and I'd had my millionth glass of wine, I told her that I'd never get a boyfriend, but when I got a girlfriend she'd be the first to know. I then stormed out of the apartment, accidentally knocking a glass over, and took a cab home. My phone immediately started blowing up, but i turned notifications off and went straight to bed. One of me and my sisters mutual friend, who was on the party, told me the next day that a wild discussion about what I said to my aunt was held and then the party cut short, my sister locked herself in her room crying and everyone went home. I have now been blocked my most of my family and relatives, my sister sent me a nasty next about how me coming out on her part stole her thunder, and my mother no longer considers me family. \n\nI'm not gonna try to make up excuses for my behavior, because I definitely could have been a more supporting sister, but I just wanted to know, AITA?", "created_utc": 1685796540, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13zbw2s/aita_for_stealing_my_sisters_thunder_on_her/", "score": 3461, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What is wrong with you? This is my sister's engagement party, who says that at someone else's engagement party? Why can't you all be happy for my sister, who is engaged and looking beautiful?\"\n\nIt's looking like you might be the favoured younger child, and you've not done anything to call that out before. ESH I really feel bad for your sister, imagine being called the unattractive sibling at your engagement party and have everyone prioritise your single sisters potential future engagement over your own actual engagement.", "ESH \nLet me explain. It isn\u2019t YOUR fault you were asked questions. Period. The relatives kept saying stuff that was 1) Taking the shine off of your sister 2) Bringing up your dating status.\nI wish you would have 1) Quit drinking when you were getting interrogated 2) Left earlier\nI wish you would have come out at a later date, OR better still a long time ago, Dear.\nLife is short.", "NAH, your sister and you both deserved better. Your family was being a bunch of AH both to her and to you. \n\nThings were already going sideways before you came out. You shouldn\u2019t need to hide who you are and although there may have been a better time for it (ok\u2014well, like, maybe) it sounds like you were completely pressured into it.", "NTA You weren\u2019t the one making it all about you, your family was. Who the fuck says that someone is more attractive than someone else right in front of the person?", "ESH.\n\nThere are a bunch of homophobic assholes.\n\nYou shouldn't have made a scene, and you shouldn't have been drinking.\n\nThat was not the place nor the time to come out.\n\nEDIT : About the drinking, i think everybody at the party should not have been drinking. \n\nIt feels to me like they were pretty much all drunk and I think it's another family issue. OP should have known better. She knows how her family is and that the drinking was not going to help.\n\nAs OP did cause \u00e0 scene by leaving the way she did. She was drunk, knocked \u00e0 glass on the way out. That's making \u00e0 sc\u00e8ne.\n\nAnd someone commented that I should not tell someone when  or where to come out. That's true. And chances are, it would have been \u00e0 disaster no matter where and when, but the sister already had a shitty night and OP's announcement just made it worst.\n\nBy the sound of it, both sisters have suffered their fair share of emotionnal abuse from their familiy.", "ESH\n\n Them for being intrusive and their comments about you being the prettier sister. \n\n Your sister for blaming you for their questioning. \n\n A very very very little you for chosing this party to come out. I love your answer to aunt, but maybe this party wasn't the place for it. \n\n And the worst of all assholes is your mother. I  don't have kids, but i can't imagine turning my back on my kid just because they're gay.", "NTA. Your family bullied you into your outburst. Ideally you wouldn\u2019t have caved to that pressure on your sister\u2019s engagement party but a person can only take so much so I really don\u2019t blame you. Your family sound awful. That \u201cprettier sister\u201d remark is unforgivable.", "I\u2019m going to go against most of the grain here and say, NTA. You sister was pissed off at you, before you even came out. She was mad at YOU and saying YOU were making it about yourself, when that was not true AT ALL. People were harassing you, that is NOT your fault. The FAMILY was making it about you, you were not. While you should not have come out at her engagement party, the timing was really poor, she was already super pissed at you anyway and I understand the anger of why you snapped.", "NTA. You were pushed  by your family into deliver a reaction you never intended in the first place. Your familiy are the big assholes here. Your sister unfortunately is another victim because of this, but she then became an asshole too by choosing not to undersstand that your family was at fault, and started blaming you. I'd advice you to cut ties with your family because you would never be at peace with your life and yourself, just chase your happiness, and love whoever you want to love. Your family is not realy your family if they don't love and support you. I know it's not easy, but don't you dare think that you are any bit at fault. Go on, don't let yourself , your peace, your future and your happiness be affected by this. GOOD LUCK", "I don't think it was your fault that the family was grilling you about your personal life over dinner. I think almost every example I've read on reddit where the OP said something after drinking too much, I end up thinking they are the AH. In this case, I would go with ESH - except for the sister. She should not have blamed you for the early discussion, but she otherwise was just trying to enjoy a big moment in her life. Her family did not allow her to do so.", "NTA - I'm not sure how you could've stopped them being more interested in you than in your sister... You can't help it that they're calling you prettier on her engagement party.", "NTA and neither is your sister. You're both victims of shitty family dynamics. You snapped, it happens and usually happens in high pressure/intense situations; this definitely fits the bill. All night trying to deflect obnoxious comments that effectively erase your identity while your sister blames you instead of the family? Of course you lost it and made an impulsive choice. \n\nAfter things calm down a bit, maybe try to explain to your sister what it's like to be trapped in the closet. That it sucks the family kept making her feel like shit, but most of those same comments made you feel ironically invisible and trapped. Admit that part of you is a little jealous because she doesn't have to hide a major part of her identity and you know her marriage is accepted while your potential future marriage to a woman wouldn't be, but that it doesn't mean you aren't happy for her or wish she didn't have the blessings she has.\n\nHopefully your sister can realize your parents and family are the enemy and you and she are the allies you both need. Good luck.", "Easy NTA and I'm sorry this happened to you. Im sure this isn't how you wanted to come out. You're the only not asshole here. \n\nYour sister sucks. It's OK for her to he annoyed about what happened at her party but that was your family not you. You both were the victim but she took it out on you. Your family entirely sucks.", "man these judgments are absolutely bullshit. you endured endless pestering from asshole family at a party that should have been about your sister, then had said sister act like you were the problem  and somehow *your* the bad guy because you had enough of all the bullshit? fuck. that. hard NTA and shame on reddit for acting otherwise. you're better off without the lot of them, including your sister, cause she was completely out of line to berate you for the rest of the family being assholes.", "Honestly ima say NTA. I can see you freaking out and storming off. Fuck your family.", "Fuck em.\n\nLive your life!", "Sorry your family sucks", "ESH. Your family of course for bringing up your life at all much less harping on it. You for not being an adult and knowing you needed to leave before you snapped.", "ESH. \n\nYour sister isn\u2019t right for taking it out on you but this was a huge deal to her and I understand her being really upset. \n\nYour family shouldn\u2019t have pressed you so hard but I also understand where they were coming from as they are curious about your love life especially since you have never brought anyone around before. Since they didn\u2019t know you were closeted they didn\u2019t know that they were pressing on a really sensitive subject.\n\nThe grandma who called you the attractive sister should be excommunicated. \n\nThe situation did really suck for you but coming out at your sister\u2019s thing wasn\u2019t the right time or place. You already knew she was upset and had been crying and you should have supported her more on that day. \n\nAlso OP please consider that having your sister be the sole keeper of your secret has likely been hard on her. It takes conscious effort to not let that secret come out accidentally during conversation. It also creates anxiety as your sister probably worries about how your family will react when they do find out. She likely regularly sees or hears them making comments about you and she can\u2019t freely explain or have a conversation about you because she can\u2019t let it slip. It takes a lot of mental effort to police your words. While the secret is yours and your choice when to share and to who, sharing on your sister\u2019s day when it was going downhill instead of trying to get the party back on track for her was not the best call IMO.", "ESH, except your sister.\n\nYour family sucks for making the party about questioning you, and for being a bunch of homophobes.\n\nYou suck for getting drunk and coming out at your sister's engagement party.", "You could've just left.

YTA", "YTA and so is your family. \n\nYou came out to the entire family at HER engagement party, you should\u2019ve waited until it was appropriate.

Although you can\u2019t control your families comments and how they were acting, it also doesn\u2019t sound like you tried to calmly and rationally put an end to the comments that were being made until you decided to blow up and come out. Your sister was the only one that knew, she kept your secret, and this is how you repay her? Kind of sounds like you are jealous of her because you\u2019ll never get the same support with the wedding festivities. That doesn\u2019t mean you have to ruin hers though.\n\nThe rest of your family also sounds like a bunch of toxic assholes, which is why ESH.", "ESH.  Sounds like everyone had way too much to drink.  Something to think about.", "NTA", "NTA, but your family (excluding your sister) sure is.", "NTA", "Sounds like you were pushed past your limit, felt trapped, and a bit drunk, and decided without deciding that it was time to be honest about who you are.\n\nYour sister may have a bad couple of days over not being the center of attention for this big event. But your reality is that you have no idea if your family will EVER be supportive, much less excited, for all the big days to come in your own life.\n\nComing out is not always at the perfect time, and that's the fault of homophobes, not people who just want to live their life and be who they are.\n\nNTA", "NTA, your family kinda sucks though tbh", "This sounds unrealistic. If it happened the way you're saying it happened then you literally said and did NOTHING for half an hour to an hour while being CONSTANTLY focused on by half your family despite repeated attempts to demur their attention.\n\nAnd for it to go so far as to make your sister break down crying in the bathroom with you not having said word one? What extreme melodrama.\n\nSo major NTA.\n\nBut I've never seen that kind of social dynamic play out so I *suspect* that you either siad or did more than you realize or than you're writing here. As written, this would be a bad sitcom moment.", "Here's the response that should've been given: \"we're here for sister's engagement, we can talk about me another time.\" Repeated at nauseam. ESH", "ESH, wow", "You were N T A until you decided to out yourself then and there.\n\n\nThat made you squarely an AH, so ESH. I give your sister a nta as she couldn't help having to deal with your family pretty much ignoring her and tearing her down.", "ESH, you for drinking too much and selfishly ruining the party, your sister a bit of an AH when she was blaming you earlier, but you proved her right later, your mom and grandma are pretty massive assholes for saying those things in your sister's presence but you are the biggest AH, especially when you already knew your sister was upset about you", "Ahhh it\u2019s pride month so gotta start making shit posts about gay people\u2026.", "Well yes, and no.   \n\nYour family were aholes for not letting your romantic life drop, and for placing you above your sister. They absolutely started it and frankly that party was a mess before you came out. \n\nClear headed you would probably have done well to stop drinking, make your excuses and leave right then. \n\nSadly that is not what happened, and regardless of how you got to that point announcing anything at someone else\u2019s significant event or party makes you the asshole. \n\nSo yea, YTA.

A simple \u201caunt/mom/etc, this event is about my sister, let\u2019s discuss her upcoming wedding/fianc\u00e9/plans after marriage instead!\u201d would have reverted the conversation back to where it belonged. \n\nYou did make her engagement all about you.

Your family is absolute AH for pressuring you with constant questions and especially with the nasty remark that you're the more attractive sister. They tore the attention from your sister to you, and it's ridiculous to blame you for it, as your sister did.\n\nAbout coming out and getting drunk, I cannot blame you that it happened as it happened. Who would stand family's interrogation sober? When you try to stay at the party and not make a scene, show your support to your sister as well as you can -she just didn't want to receive it. I also understand snapping and wanting to put an end to the constant questioning that must have got incredibly stressful, drunken or not. \n\nYou did not ruin the party. It was ruined by your family long ago you came out.

Maybe one day you'll find a girlfriend and a family that accepts you.", "This is tough one because, on the surface, coming out at your sisters engagement party should make you TA, but you were kind of goaded and pushed into it. I DO feel like you maybe should\u2019ve said something about how it\u2019s your sisters day so the focus should be on her, not you. You also probably should\u2019ve either held your tongue or made up an excuse to leave early. I\u2019m going to go with ESH. \n\nI\u2019m sorry your family are a bunch of AHs. Bugging you a little would be ridiculous enough but to say that you\u2019re the prettier one or to make anything about you on a day that was meant to be celebrating your sister and her fianc\u00e9 is just outrageous. \n\nApologize and make sure your sister knows you feel bad but you were also backed into a corner and it just sorta came out.", "NTA. \nNot your fault for being born into a homophobic family where you can\u2019t be yourself.

The only person you need to apologize to is your sister and I would work on that ASAP.", "Awww, you stole your sisters thunder long before your drunk admission about getting a GF.

You should have stayed sober and just walked out when the grilling was ramping up and rose above your ridiculous family.  Not that you shouldn't feel free to be out and yourself but getting drunk,making a loud declaration, breaking dishes, and storming out isn't real mature.\n\nHonestly, maybe time to go no contact with these dysfunctional weirdos for a while and get yourself some therapy.

You had zero control over the line of questioning. That\u2019s not your fault at all.\n\nThe coming out bit doesn\u2019t seem to be about sharing your identity to people you love. Just seems like you weaponized it because you were annoyed and angry at everyone around you. I totally get it. It\u2019s just a dick move and lacks the kind of grace that\u2019s called for at Engagement Parties, especially when you knew that your delicate sis has been planning this as soon as she got out of the womb.

Their engagement party was basically a dinner with friends and close relatives, and my sister went all out on the food. To her marriage is a huge deal, and she's had her whole wedding and married life planned out since we were kids. I've never felt the same excitement for weddings and kids and such things, even though i do want it at some point, and since I'm a lesbian in an homophobic family, i long ago accepted that a big fancy wedding with my father walking me down the aisle isn't part of the plan. This doesn't sadden me much, but my sister (who's the only one in my family who know about my sexuality) has been convinced that I'm jealous of her since she started dating her fianc\u00e9. \n\nThe dinner started out great, but after the main course, my family and relatives started asking about my dating life. It was pretty harmless questions at first, such as \"when are you getting a boyfriend?\" and \"why aren't you dating? I saw that boy hitting on you just yesterday!\" It annoyed me, but my sister seemed even more annoyed. After dessert, when the alcohol started kicking in, the questions got a little out of hand. My mom said \"I can't believe your sister got engaged first, you've always been more social!\" and my grandma commented on that I was \"the more attractive sister\". My sister obviously got hurt by this, and I caught her crying in the bathroom at one point. I tried to talk to her, but all she said was \"Happy? You've made my engagement allt about you.\" and then avoided me for the rest of the party.\n\nSo this is the part where i might have been the bad guy. After my aunt asked when I would get a boyfriend for the millionth time, and I'd had my millionth glass of wine, I told her that I'd never get a boyfriend, but when I got a girlfriend she'd be the first to know. I then stormed out of the apartment, accidentally knocking a glass over, and took a cab home. My phone immediately started blowing up, but i turned notifications off and went straight to bed. One of me and my sisters mutual friend, who was on the party, told me the next day that a wild discussion about what I said to my aunt was held and then the party cut short, my sister locked herself in her room crying and everyone went home. I have now been blocked my most of my family and relatives, my sister sent me a nasty next about how me coming out on her part stole her thunder, and my mother no longer considers me family. \n\nI'm not gonna try to make up excuses for my behavior, because I definitely could have been a more supporting sister, but I just wanted to know, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It does sound like the family was focused on OP. \n\nEither way it\u2019s her day, family and OP should\u2019ve been respectful about that.

Op could have absolutely tried to shut things down. However, by the sounds of it, the family wouldn't have let it go, and the result would have been the same. Op also said that her sister seems to have the idea that she is jealous of her engagement, so pretty much anything Op did was gonna be wrong. The only thing the sister did was wrong was to completely blame  Op for the first bit.. Op doubling down and using it as an excuse to come out and ACTUALLY ruin the party is what makes her an AH. Up until then, she was fine.\n\nI 100% agree that they ow her an apology, though.", "I completely agree, OP is not an AH for the family\u2019s questioning, the family is.

OP did not write how she responded to the family\u2019s questions. Her reaction doesn\u2019t sound great, but I wouldn\u2019t go as far as to say it makes her an AH at all.

It is her engagement party and everyone is asking you why it isn\u2019t you getting married.

Witches, gays and weirdos have always been more family to me than family. \n\nIt's a shame we can't ALL just accept everyone as a human. The fuck is wrong with people? I mean we're all different, how BORING would the planet be if we were all the same? Embrace everyone, regardless...we're all just trying to get through the day...if we can make others smile while we're doing it, that IS A GOOD DAY. If we manage to laugh and other people laugh with us, then THAT IS A GREAT DAY. I strive to be the one who gives someone else something to smile or laugh about every day. I think I'm doing a pretty good job of it too!", "[removed]", "Thank you. It's not always easier. Maybe it was easier for Vegetan.", "That's fair. The way I interpreted this was that OP was vague and evasive instead of just shutting the interrogation down. \n\nI can't imagine how frustrated OP was knowing what a dumpster fire of a family they are. That alone doesn't warrant the behavior. OP had too much to drink and handled the situation poorly. \n\nI think the family are the villains.", "OP had the opportunity to de-escalate multiple times, she chose not to. OP had the opportunity to leave before causing a scene. She chose not to. OP is sympathetic and not the only asshole, but she did asshole stuff, and I'm not gonna blame someone who literally got called ugly by family members at their own engagement party for being mad at OP for escalating (even if it was \"justified\").", "Absolutely. All I am saying is, OP probably went down this road before.  I feel lousy she let them take her down a road where she is going to be a jerk, not them.", "Not the appropriate event", "They basically forced her out because they wouldn\u2019t shut the fork up. It\u2019s not her fault.", "Yeah, I have also experienced it in many ocassions. And it's not that easy, the amount of patience and sheer will you gotta do every single time.\n\nShe tried holding it together for her sister, that's probably why she drank. If she left early because of comments... don't you think it would also been a scene and be blamed for it? \"You stole my attention in MY day and then left early!\". Everyone would still be talking about her, what's wrong about her.\n\nThe family is the one creating a rift between them, playing favourites, being nosy (and plain disrespectful, cause wtf are you doing? if someone tells you they're single, what more questions do you have?) and on top of that, homophobic. She just exploded at an inconvenient time, after the family already ruined it for both.", "And her family was drunk and asking shitty inappropriate questions. Yet it\u2019s her fault for being equally as drunk and answering them?", "I would imagine she\u2019s been doing it her whole life \ud83d\ude22", "> I am well aware of the sub\n\nSorry I didn\u2019t mean to suggest you didn\u2019t! Was just trying to make a joke", "Ok I\u2019ll posit you this. Next time you\u2019re at an event important to a person close to you, respond to any unwanted comments by other people at that event by blowing up. See how that goes over and how people think of your behavior", "If you witness bullying and you choose to stay neutral then you\u2019re on the side of the oppressor. OP mentions her families awful comments to her sister but doesn\u2019t stand up for her sister. She *is* responsible for that and she contributed to making it worse after", "Sorry I didn\u2019t know you knew them personally, I was just going off what I read.", "Well, her sister probably cares about her own engagement party. Wtf is wrong with people? Sure her family was the main reason it was ruined, but OP could have dealt with this more subtle. They all trashed her sisters engagement party.", "\n\n>OP had the opportunity to de-escalate multiple times, she chose not to\n\nwhat a fascinating *assumption* you have come up with to try and justify why you think she's an asshole.", "I don't care. they lost the right to consideration on ops part long before she actually snapped", "She was not water boarded. No one forced her to blow up & storm out. She\u2019s an adult", "She ruined it. The sister would have gotten over it but she made it worse by choosing to come out. She really didnt try to hold it for her sister because if she did she would have simply left. Why be around people who are down your throat anyway?", "This sub can be crazy. You can have a story about someone waking up to find their foot is being cut off but if they scream at their attacker they\u2019re just as bad as the foot cutting person.", "They didnt know she was in the closet so YES shes at fault for COMING OUT to her homophobic family at her SISTERS engagement party. She even said they have done this before which means u should know how to handle it and what ur limit to their bs is. She could have easily left and her sister would have understood.", "It's honestly amazing that you are literally demonstrating your inability to understand that OP tried to disengage, but the other people continued to push. Reply all you want, I'm done with this discussion.", "\n\n>OP mentions her families awful comments to her sister but doesn\u2019t stand up for her sister\n\nit sure is amusing how many of you assume that op just passively sat back and said nothing as her family insulted her sister. must be easy to justify your judgment when it's based primarily on your assumptions of what op did or didn't do.", "I could not give a single solitary fuck about what the sister cares about after she blamed op for other people's actions. what's wrong with people is an excellent question that should be asked of anyone trying to claim op is an asshole", "How is that an assumption? Literally, de-escalating is as simple as, \"hey, let's focus on sister!\" Or \"why would you say that? That's not kind.\"\n\nI don't know what your issue is, everyone, and I mean every single person mentioned in this story, is an asshole. OP included because there were things she could have done instead of make the situation worse.", "You may not care, but OP clearly does because she posted here. \n\nNot exactly sure what \u201clost the right to consideration\u201d means, but if you\u2019re suggesting OP doesn\u2019t have to think about anyone else\u2019s feelings, then why bother even going to the party?", "Yep. You don't get it. Like, not trying to be antagonistic or an asshole here, just. You DON'T get it, and probably won't unless you've been in a similar situation. \n\nReally wish life was as easy as \"why be around people who are down your throat anyway\", honestly.", "Something tells me her sister (who blamed her for being hounded by the family) would not have understood her leaving the party early.", "\"Jeez, we always punch you in the face. Why are you so upset about it now?\"", "She could have not come out. Absolutely agree. \n\nI am not talking at all about how she handled the situation. But demonizing her for drinking when that was clearly the entire families intention at the part is insane.\n\nEdit: and at the same time I feel her family are much greater assholes than her for coming out in that manner. \n\nShe wasn\u2019t perfect. But her family is a bunch of raging AHs.", "Keep up the stereotype that this sub is filled with teenagers with no life experience, cheers", "So you just missed the bottom of the post where OP admits she could have been a more supportive sister.", "You have a hard time understanding something here.\n\nWhen the family Kept asking questions, OP could have chosen to respond with for example \u00abhey, it\u2019s my sisters engangement party. Can we talk about something else?\u00bb No, instead OP chose to drink more, get more drunk and storm off. She ruined her sisters party, which means her sister is correct and OP is AH here.", "it's an assumption because there is nothing in this story to suggest that she didn't do exactly that. you are merely assuming that she didn't attempt to de escalate.  unless of course, you can point out where op sat back on her ass and said nothing to family pestering her and insulting her sister.", "Yea in her messed up mind she wouldnt \u201cunderstand\u201d but she\u2019d probably be in a better mood. The attention would be back on her and she could enjoy her party. Instead of bashing her sister because shes jealous", "not like that \ud83d\ude02. All she had to do was leave. Shes at fault for doing this at her SISTERS ENGAGEMENT PARTY bottom line. Idc about her being a lesbian thats not what my point is", "you want to explain how that translates to 'didn't say anything to her family'?"]}
