{"id": 24496, "submission_id": "15p9kxd", "title": "AITA for snapping at my late father's pregnant widow when she reached out to me", "selftext": "My mom died when I was a baby so I never got the chance to remember her. My father ended up getting arrested when I was 7 months old and my family found out he had been doing a lot of shady stuff behind my mom's back and behind the back of his best friend who he ran a business with. My father was in and out of prison when I was a kid and did some shitty things. I was raised by my maternal side of the family and cut off all contact with my father when I was 8 after he tried to use me to escape prison again. His family were never interested in me so I don't know a thing about them.\n\nI'm 19 now and a woman contacted me to inform me that my father had died. She sent me the obituary (where she had mentioned me) and asked if I would come to the funeral. I said no, but thanks for letting me know, I guess. She did not leave it there and a few weeks later reached out and told me she was expecting my father's child. I asked her why she was telling me and she was like, this is your sibling and I was like by blood maybe but not in a family way and I ignored the next message.\n\nThen she contacted me again two weeks ago. She said my father's family had made it known they did not care to know her or her baby and she was desperate for her child to have some family. She said I was going to have a sister and she wanted me to be in her daughter's life, as her daughter's brother. I told her no, to stop contacting me and blocked her.\n\nShe found my number and called me and begged me to give being a brother a chance and to give her daughter a chance. I lost it. I told her that her daughter is NOTHING to me. She is not my sister. Not part of my life. Nothing. That just because the same guy got her and my mom pregnant did not mean we needed to know each other. She married a criminal who didn't do shit for his kid and she should accept that it comes with consequences for her daughter, since there is nothing to tie her to me except blood, which is a shitty tie in my opinion. I told her if she contacted me again I would get in touch with a lawyer and see if I can make her leave me alone.\n\nShe started crying and ended the call. She sent me a text saying she was just a mom trying to do the best for her daughter and I didn't need to be cruel to her. Someone else texted me saying I was a dick to a pregnant lady (don't know who that was, maybe even her again because she was crazy enough to seek out my number after being told to leave me alone).\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1691859392, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15p9kxd/aita_for_snapping_at_my_late_fathers_pregnant/", "score": 23, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And you\u2019re right. Blood is a shitty tie", "NTA. Her initial contacts to tell you your father had died and that she is pregnant are not unreasonable, you made it clear you don\u2019t want to know her or her daughter. She then becomes an AH by continuing, she says you\u2019re fathers family made it clear they are not interested so is she still harassing them? Don\u2019t feel bad, pregnancy is not an excuse.", "Wooooooow NTA What an insane thing for her to do. Next it would be asking you for money and to take care of her daughter whilst she's off doing who knows what. \n\nCrazy how she was able to find and get your number. If the rest of your family didn't want anything to do with her then it's not down to you to shoulder that.", "NTA\n\nMy guess is that she wants to dump the kid on you or get money from you.", "NTA\n\nThis phrase: \"doing the best for her daughter\" exactly what value does she think a 19 year old stranger is going to add to her daughter's life? Not to be rude but a 19 year old doesn't have much to offer a single soon-to-be-mom, facilitating a relationship between her child and OP is going to cost this single mom considerable financial resources since it's unlikely OP can afford to on his own. What is she and her daughter going to get back during these difficult early years when the baby won't even remember?\n\nI'm going to offer a double standard, with the common denominator as OP's dad. OP's mom got together with his dad before dad's criminality was uncovered. This woman got with him after his criminality and deadbeat-dad position was known. OP would be wise to avoid this woman, she's at the very least a naive judge of character and at the worst also a criminal, it's not worth finding out where in between those points she resides.\n\nShe wants her kid to have family she can go looking in her own family tree.", "NTA - neither of them are anything to you. Maybe you share some DNA with the unborn child, but that doesn't make you \"family.\" You told her \"no\" several times and asked her to stop contacting you. She continued to do so anyway, so she deals with the consequences of that. You did nothing wrong here. You have a right to choose who is and is not in your life.", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s not your problem and if she doesn\u2019t stop contacting you then make it formal through the police or court system", "NTA. I understand her initial contact to you, which was to tell you about your father\u2019s passing, and even the second one to tell you about the baby. I was originally of the opinion of N A H, until she pushed you. When you declined going to the funeral, she should have taken the hint. When she told you about her baby, and you didn\u2019t ask any questions or display any emotion, this lady should have read the room and left you alone. You asked her to stop contacting you, and she decided to harass you. You have no duty to her, or her child, and that\u2019s the end of it.", "Feels like she is looking  for a support system and thinks she can manipulate you into being that. You did the right thing. It\u2019s your choice and this baby is not your responsibility . You tried being nice but it didn\u2019t work. I feel a bit sorry for her but trying to rope in a teenager as a support system / babysitter or whatever  is not the right thing to do", "NTA, Your Bio father is just a rando on the street to you after breaking your trust. You are not interested in his Business. Even after saying no multiple times, she still persists and so she is probably desperate and alone and its probably not about the daughter. But still it should not be your concern because that bond was shattered long ago.", "I guess ESH, but man, you are pretty heartless.\n\nI understand you have no relationship with your dad.  But damn, this woman is pregnant and her husband just died.  Whether you want to acknowledge it or not, this will be your sibling.\n\nI do think that at some point she should have left it alone, or at least given you more time, so I'm not absolving her.  But I'm willing to give a pregnant grieving widow a bit of slack for wanting her child to know his/her family.\n\nThis is a situation where reddit, with it being a bunch of people who don't really understand human interaction, will be totally on your side.  But IRL, you come off like a jerk.\n\nThink about how many people find siblings by doing these ancestry things.  I have friends who thats happened with.  And they have built a relationship.  Maybe not a sibling bond, but relationship.\n\nIf in 20 years they found you online through something like this, would you be a jerk to them, or be willing to meet them and learn about their life?\n\nEdit:  I'm saying this as someone with next to no relationship with my dad.  He was a deadbeat growing up, and when I tried reconnecting as an adult, he wasn't much better.  But if I learned he had a child, I wouldn't blame them for that, and would be open to getting to know them.\n\nThis post from a few years ago sums up. how I feel about this:  https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/d6xoro/meta\\_this\\_sub\\_is\\_moving\\_towards\\_a\\_value\\_system/?sort=confidence", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
