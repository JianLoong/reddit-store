The age gap is creepy but you as a kid would have got over it pretty quickly. A 20 year old to a 6 year old is still an an adult \n\nBut yeah, the deliberate lie makes me wonder what else they are keeping from you. Have either of them even apologised?\n\nNTA and they aren't sorry at all, you're getting justifications. You can invite whoever you want to your wedding.", "I'm going to say NTA at the moment - You say you uninvited them in the heat of the moment, you should sit down with your dad and Sam and talk this out - because they apparently lied to you (and only you if your aunt knew) for most of your life.  And people are going to say it's a harmless lie...but if it was harmless, then there wasn't any reason to tell it in the first place.    \n\n\nI think what your dad misses when he says \"16 years on you can't make that judgment\" is that it hasn't been 16 years for you.  You just found out.  He's been living with this fact for over a decade.  So as his family.  They've all had time to adjust.  You've just been told (1) a fact that you find inappropriate and (2) that it's been purposefully withheld from you for 16 years.  It's probably thrown a lot of questions into your head, asking what else they may have lied about.", "NTA\n\nIf the age gap wasn't a problem they wouldn't have lied about it. And it looks like they would have continued to lie about it.", "I think i don't understand reddit. Everyone in this sub, recently, flipped out over a 20 year old and 30 year old dating, to the point of calling it grooming, but think an 18 year age gap is OK because it worked out just fine for 16 years? I don't see the difference. Both should be fine or neither should be fine, surely. But yes NTA because of the sustained lie and 0 apology", "So he was 38 and she was 20?\n\nI agree it all sucks. \n\nAt the time I wouldn\u2019t have approved either. Absolutely would have judged him and thought he was manipulating her or somehow being predatory.\n\nBut\u2026. 16 years later, if they\u2019ve been *happy* for 16 years including her, then let them be happy.\n\nI think they owe you a conversation. Or maybe you at least need to talk to her one on one about how she feels and she can clear up the history.\n\nThey owe you some apology for the false pretense, but, I\u2019m not sure you should throw away the whole relationship", "NTA. Lying to someone for that long is an asshole thing to do, the fact that everyone going y t a because of the ages is not focusing on the main issue. The lying is the main issue.\n\nThe fabricated an age, ONLY FOR THE OP AND THEIR MOTHER, the rest the family **knew her real age.** This isn't a white lie, this is a complex one that everyone hid from OP. That opens a huge insecurity up. I've watched what a lie like this does especially when a whole family is in on it. And the skeletons in the closet that tumbled out because of 'if they lied this long about it, what else did the lie about?' OP is not the asshole in this situation. Emotional, however not the asshole.\n\nTalk to your partner first. It's not the ages, it's the fact your *entire family lied to you and your mother for 16 years*, knew they were lying and kept it up. They kept it up until you were of age and then kept it going until someone slipped up.", "Hot take I guess but, I understand feeling hurt by the deception. Uninviting them may be a big jump imo but, I think you need to take some time to sit with your feelings then proceed from there. Either way NTA.", "NTA.

This lie is fresh for you since it makes sense you have extreme emotions. You are also allowed to invite or disinvite anyone to your wedding.", "NAH.\n\nUnderstand OP feelings of being lied too and finding out Sam was much younger than originally was told when she met OP dad.\n\nThe wedding invite being rescinded is up to OP, but I think OP should talk with Sam and the dad and find out why they lied and why they didn\u2019t OP when OP was older instead of hiding it for so long.\n\nOP has a good relationship with Sam and I think OP shouldn\u2019t just go LC/NC with them cause of this one lie.", "NTA for reacting how you did, because it was a shock, but YWBTA if you let this ruin your relationship with them. Was their relationship a little creepy at the time? Yes. Did they lie to avoid judgment from people? Yes. But it was so very long ago, and the two of them have found some happiness together in this life, so try to focus on that, and find some of your own by forgiving them.", "ESH- \nThey lied. So, obviously they suck for that. \n\nYou\u2019re not obligated to invite them to the wedding, but everything was perfectly fine until you found out. They love each other, and have been in a relationship for 16 years. You\u2019re judging them for\u2026 what? Exactly? Now the age gap is weird and you\u2019re punishing them for it.", "He lied to manipulate your feelings. Him telling Sam who she can be friends with shows he needs to control people. He is extra mad because now he can't control you and force you to let him attend the wedding. \n\nAnd you can still judge his relationship 16 years later. Funny how telling you in real-time made him think you wouldn't accept Sam. But learning 16 years later makes you not want to accept HIM!\n\nNta", "NTA\n\nyeah the whole situation  is a bit sus. the age gap os a really biggy 18 years but whats done is done. the fact they lied and both thought to lie as they even knew it wasnt good and for that long thats more than enough to be upset with them", "NTA \n\n>My dad says 16 years on I can\u2019t make that judgment, \n\nWell, since he didn't let anyone use their own judgment at the time, I think you can. If not, you can sure make a judgment call on his lying for 16 years, and presumably making Sam lie as well, so she's always known he was embarrassed by her to some degree. \n\nHe lied to create this exact situation,  where now it's been too long and you already accepted it. He did it at the expense of his own integrity and his relationships. There are consequences for being caught out as a liar.", "NTA. my aunt\u2019s ex turned out to be a predator and it\u2019s taken my cousins years to process. he didn\u2019t do anything to my cousins/his kids so it was difficult for them to grasp the enormity of the situation, especially as it happened when they were kids. when it\u2019s your parent it\u2019s hard. this is the beginning of a long journey and i recommend therapy to help you through the emotions and realizations.", "Meh.. when it boils down to it you\u2019re allowed to un/invite whoever you want to your wedding.

But if you stand your ground, ESH.", "ESH.  Should they have lied?  No.  Do you have to invite them to your wedding, especially if you\u2019re now concerned what *else* they might have lied about?  Also no.  But does making a stink over the age gap sixteen years and two kids into what appears to be a happy marriage accomplish *anything* of value?  I\u2019m really not seeing what or how.", "ESH for them lying to you but at the same time, you're *punishing* Sam as well who you seemed to have had a great relationship with prior to this.", "NTA, they lied to you for 16!! years", "ESH\n\nOf course you\u2018re allowed to uninvite people from your wedding and they shouldn\u2019t have lied to you, but you also shouldn\u2019t judge and insult their relationship. It seems to be healthy, loving & long-lasting.", "I don\u2019t condone lying to your family about things like this, but I do think you\u2019re making a way bigger deal out of this than you should be.\n\nDo you have the right to be upset? *Absolutely.* Is this something to uninvite your dad and stepmom from your wedding over? *Absolutely not.*\n\nMost kids don\u2019t keep track of their parents\u2019 ages. Hell, I don\u2019t even remember how old my mom was when she had me or how old she even said she was when she married my dad. I think you\u2019re making a mountain out of a molehill, and you should apologize to your dad and invite your dad and your stepmom back.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter how old they were when they got together. You shouldn\u2019t care about this. Your dad was wrong for lying to you, but there are a million other things he could have lied to you about that are so much worse than this. At the end of the day, you don\u2019t want to burn any bridges. After all, on the bright side, you still have your dad and stepmom in your life and to have them both want to be at your side during your wedding day is important and would mean the world to both you and them.\n\nYTA.", "NTA. Though I wouldn't disinvite them yet. However, they did lie to you for years to have you like her. Kinda disgusting because your dad knew it was wrong.", "If I have a advice in your future ,don't ever do something for the peace of family! It will never end well and people will take advantage of the situation! I you don't want them in your marriage knowing they lied all this time and your dad was dating a minor when he was in his 30s then don't do it! He is a predator and it's gross, nobody have a say about this! \n\nEdit: make a mistake about the age she wasn't a minor but 20 but still a predator! I just hope Op will not discover another lie like they were having a affair that's why he married her soon after the divorce!", "Let it go.  It's been 16 years and she's been wonderful to all of you", "> it\u2019s still iffy but she was an adult.\n\n20 is considered an adult too. While I agree it isn't great, what has it changed actually? It doesn't change your relationship with them. It's okay to be upset with your dad about not being upfront but sounds like you never asked either. This is one small blip that you are turning into a mole hill.", "Yeah, YTA.on this one.\n\nThey've been together 16 years, and she was an adult when they got together. You're cool to have your opinions about it, but your misunderstanding is not their fault", "YTA.\n\nYou may find it gross that a 38 yo would date a 20yo, and I agree with you.  And I think the lying was unnecessary, and wrong, but it was a long time ago.  You can blame your Dad but I think Sam has no blame here.\n\n\\[EDIT:  Yes I realize the continued to lie about her age. NOT MY MAIN POINT.\\]\n\nBut if you ban your father and his wife from your wedding, you are going to create a rift that will probably never heal.  Are you willing to cut off these two half-siblings and this \"mother figure\" just to punish your dad for lying to you 16 years ago?\n\nBy now you should judge them by the life they are living and the family they have made, not their ages when they met.", "ESH but mostly you. \n\nThey shouldn't have lied but it was 16 years ago. You're throwing 16 years away simply because you wouldn't do what they did. Is this something you really want to do? \n\nGranted it was a idiotic lie, was bound to come out sometime. But maybe they thought you would be older and more mature when it did. \n\nShe was 19/20, it was legal. You've said yourself they seem happy together, if you had any concerns otherwise it may have been different.", "I would say soft YTA ... Age doesn't define a person; she was legal age; the difference in age is irrelevant as long as there wasn't anything nefarious going on and it's evident there wasn't. She's a genuinely nice person and ya'll have a good relationship. Apologize and tell then you're sorry you jumped to an emotional reaction; you simply needed time to process and while you're not ok with the lies, you now understand why they did it.", "YTA. I was waiting for some big secret to come out like she was a minor, or an affair partner. The big issue is she was 20 when they got together? Yes, in general thats a huge age difference that scales from being iffy to creepy. But by all accounts of this post, they sound like they have a healthy marriage. They've been together 16 yrs, are raising 2 happy kids (at least no issues are mentioned here), and even had a healthy relationship with you growing up. And they still want to continue having a great relationship with you!!! I understand being upset in the moment, they did lie to you. But do you really want to throw that away over this one detail?", "YTA tbh. It\u2019s far too late to be upset about it. You\u2019re throwing a tantrum. Yes it was questionable but she\u2019s pushing 40 now. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s Woody Allen or anything.", "Her age is none of your business, and making a big deal about it now and ripping your family apart seems childish. You are losing the relationship with your father, your father's wife and your siblings", "YTA. I don\u2019t see why it makes a difference that Sam is six years younger than you thought. She was still a legal adult when your dad began dating her. For all you know, they hit it off before your dad knew how old she was and he decided to keep dating her. You don\u2019t know what the thought process was when they decided to begin a relationship and it\u2019s really none of your business. \n\nI agree they shouldn\u2019t have lied but I can\u2019t blame them for that. Look at the way you\u2019re overlooking how happy they\u2019ve been for the last 16 years just so you can judge them.", "ESH\n\nLying is shitty as fuck. \n\nWay to tell your SM that all of those years belong in the trash.", "YTA. It was a perfectly legal relationship and seems to be happy and long lasting. You\u2019re applying retroactive judgment to people who have been good to you your entire life.", "I see a lot of people saying \"YTA, because age doesn't matter as long as she's not a minor\". Indeed, it doesn't. So why the hell did they lie about this for this long?!\n\nThis is not about her age, this is about a lie that has been going on for 16 (!!) years.", "YTA. If they've been together 16 freaking years, then the age difference is a moot point. Why are you trying to punish them for this?", "I don\u2019t know if I want to say AssHole because you were lied to.\n\nBut as a six year old I was never allowed to ask adults how old they were. It was never my business to begin with.\n\nSam\u2019s age was never your business \n\nThey have been married 16 years she was a legal adult then I think you should let it go and yes invite them", "YTA\n\nYou can uninvite whoever you want to your wedding, but it's none of your business how old they were at the start of their apparently completely successful 16 year long relationship. \n\nShe was an adult when they got together, she is an adult now, and your offence at their age difference ignores the fact that she has agency and is apparently quite happy with her decisions. \n\nSometimes an age difference can be a sign of a toxic relationship.  This does not seem to be one of those times. Keep your judgment to yourself.", "YTA\n\nWho cares that she was 20 when your dad was 38?  They're two adults doing adult things.  What they do is none of anyone's business.  It might be creepy and strange to many, but at the end of the day, what two grown adults do with themselves is their business.  \n\nThe two of them are obviously happy being married to each other.  Punishing them over a lie from 16 years ago seems really petty.  Especially if that lie never hurt anyone.", "YTA. you can have whoever you want at your wedding, but this is an A reason for uninviting your dad and his wife to the wedding. I understand you\u2019re hurt that they lied to you, but your response is over-the-top and the adult thing to do would be to talk through it with them. Regarding the age difference, so what? They were both adults capable of consenting to the relationship.", "ESH dad and Sam lied for 16 years. That is crappy behaviour and I can see why you feel hurt and betrayed. But not inviting them to your wedding doesn\u2019t solve that lie. I do think they both owe you an Apology for their prolonged lies though.", "YTA. They've been married for 16 years. At this point, its no longer any of your business.", "YTA, you're not even upset with Sam. They've been nothing but good to you. Do you want to ruin this relationship you have with your dad/step-mom? Look at any other thread on here and realize how good you have it.", "YTA", "Let it go.  My husband is 19 years older than me.  We lied about the age gap in the beginning because people are very judgmental.  The general consensus is younger women are gold diggers and older men are creeps.  We have been married 21 years.  We have built a life and raised a family.  Neither of us had dated anyone that much younger/older prior.  We met, it was right and we have a good life.  It\u2019s been 16 years for your father and Sam.  They are happy. Who are you to judge now?", "Yta", "YTA\n\nStay in your lane. However old they were when they got together, it has obviously been working.  Your dad was not a predator using and dumping young women, he has formed a stable family with her that has lasted to this day. \n\nYou are making a rash decision that will impact your relationship with your father for the rest of your life over a stale, inconsequential secret.  By your reaction today, you certainly weren't equipped to deal with the truth 16 years ago.", "YTA.\n\nThis sub loves to pile on and pass harsh judgements against relationships with large gaps.\n\nShould they have lied? maybe, maybe not. Maybe they didn't want to deal with the passing judgments of others. Maybe they didn't want others, invalidating their relationship, simply because of the age gap. Your reaction kind of justifies the lie... \"plus, i think its gross\"\n\nNot defending your fathers decision. And your right to feel upset about being lied to.\n\nAND. They are happily coupled, for 16yrs, with two children.\n\nShe's younger than you thought - what exactly does that really change?", "NTA  \nYour dad says 16 years on you can't make that judgement, but it isn't 16 years on. You only just learned about it. Your dad is gross, manipulative, and probably a groomer. She's not old enough to be your mom", "YTA.

Or did they flirt a bit before hand?  Or have a full blown affair.  Only two people can answer that question, and they've shown they can't be trusted to do so honestly.
