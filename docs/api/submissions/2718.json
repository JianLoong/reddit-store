I just shrugged and said \"Nah haven't seen it today\" (which was technically not a lie)\n\nI feel kinda bad but I can't live like that. We work in a 7 person office with no HR and our boss is not effective at dealing with issues do I felt like this was my only option. AITA?\n\nCLARIFICATION: when he said \"that's not my sweater\" he was referring to the stink not being his sweater. The sweater was in fact his (he's a bit of an oddball, but I can't imagine even he would wear a random stinky sweater that he didn't own)\n\nEdit: I see a lot of people suggesting that I had other options, and the ideas being brought up are frankly asinine.\n\n\"Just spray some freeze and call it a day!\"\nHave you ever sprayed febreeze is a bathroom where someone took a dump? Then you know it just combines with the shit smell and almost gives it a sort of power up. Next!\n\n\"Tell HR about it\"\nSome people have trouble reading it seems. I already said it's a small office with no HR. And our boss is incapable or unwilling to address situations like this. I did in fact bring it up to him and he said to \"find a compromise\" such as allowing him to wear the sweater 3 days a week. Not a problem solver this guy\n\n\"Take it home and wash it for him\"\nI don't think this one even warrants a response. I suppose I should ask the rest of the office if they have any laundry for me to take home so I can do it all at once?\n\nEdit 2:\nI see many people bringing up the legality of this and the police being called or this going to court. May I remind everyone we're talking about a sweater? I'd love to hear how that 911 call goes. \"Officer! I need to report a missing sweater! Please send your forensics team out ASAP and track this lunatic down before the sweater thief strikes again!\n\nOr God forbid I get taken to sweater court! I hope the honorable Judge Cardigan takes pity on me and offers a reduced sentence if I do people's laundry while in prison.\n\nGet real people.

I had to sit next to a girl in school who was not very good at personal hygiene (she wasn't poor by any means but apparently didn't like to shower) and it was awful.

And this is a completely addressable issue.  The guy just needs to take it home to wash it. \n\nAnd in my mind, keeping basic hygiene is the fundamental of being a person living in society. No one should have to deal with a guy who can't be bothered to wash his sweater after over 1 year. And he chose to causally dismiss another person when confronted. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, it's a sweater. I'm more disgusted with the guy's behavior than OP's behavior. \n\nWhat would you do in this case? Take it to HR?  Or continue to suffer the smell? What would HR do, is everyone going to start smelling the sweater and pass judgment?", "\u201cTheft\u201d is not dramatic-it\u2019s a point of fact. Whether you steal a sweater or $1000- it\u2019s theft.", "You\u2019re the one that wants to argue semantics so damn bad about \u201ctechnically\u201d not lying. You TECHNICALLY took something that didn\u2019t belong to you. That is TECHNICALLY theft which is TECHNICALLY illegal.", "Go to Walmart and take a sweater off the rack and try walking out without paying for it, take it to the trash can outside, and throw it away. See what happens. Same principle. Regardless of if it smells or has been sitting there for a month or has been tried on or touched by 100 people and has junk all over it. Doesn't matter. It's not yours, and they are well within their rights to call the cops on you.", "https://youtu.be/Xs-UEqJ85KE", "Either he has some health issues due to which he couldn't smell then in that case the least he could do was acknowledge it when someone was telling him that his sweater was smelling and taken it home or he was just plain being rude.\n\nIn any case he was clearly made aware of the issue and he choose to ignore it, so now he'll have to deal with the consequences.\n\nWhy should some else suffer for some else's ignorance.", "There's a book out there called Crucial Conversations. Both you and OP would do well to read it. Unfortunately we have to go outside our comfort zones when dealing with people. OP chose to avoid and not ask him why he's unable to wash his sweater, or why he's unable to tell that the clothing smells.", "It's intriguing and I will, because I believe in productive confrontation. But the fact is that OP *did* express themselves honestly, this guy was incredibly disrespectful in response, and why should OP have to therefore take on the additional labor of structuring a high-stress conflict?", "Only a lack of skill makes this a conflict. This is a conversation,  not a fight. If OP can be bothered to be a lying sneak, fine. Definitely not management material.", "I think all human beings are entitled to clean air, water, and the right for a peaceful, prosperous existence. \n\nI don\u2019t think smelly dude disrupting an entire office has any more right to do so than a chemical plant does to release noxious gas into a neighborhood. \n\nWhile there is a remedy in the latter, the OP enacted the only solution available to them in the former.", "OP couldn't deal with the issue like an adult and thus stole, of course OP is the asshole.", "Your \"quality of life\" doesn't give permission throwing out somebody belongings. You take it up with managemer regardless of how his management style is and not be a sneaky asstwat.", "So do you go through life disposing of everything that offends you, even if it doesn\u2019t belong to you? That\u2019s some raging entitlement.", "What would \u201cdealing with it like an adult\u201d LOOK like? \n\nOp speaking to their boss? \n\nOP going to HR, or, if there is no HR dept, the person who handles HR?\n\nOp asking coworker to address the smell indirectly?\n\nOp asking coworker to please do something about the stinking sweater? \n\nOp asking coworker to wash their sweater directly?\n\n# OP DID ALL OF THE ABOVE. \n\nWhen op did all of the above, the boss, who is also HR, shrugged op off. When op told coworker their sweater stunk, they denied it. When op asked coworker to wash their sweater, coworker refused. What recourse, besides *quitting* or *stealing a coworkers dirty laundry to take it home and wash it - BOTH wildly inappropriate responses* - did OP have?", "They actually tried to and their boss did nothing, coworker did nothing, and there\u2019s no HR dept.\n\nBut tell me more how the adult thing is to suffer in silence when a coworker shows a blatant disregard for peacefully coexisting in a shared space.\n\nThere are social contracts we implicitly agree to when taking part in social circumstances. \n\nWear pants.\nWash your hands.\nCover your nose when you sneeze.\n\nWashing your clothes is up there.\n\nWashing your clothes more than once a month is wayyy up there.\n\nWashing one sweater that you\u2019ve worn for over a month that your coworker has already spoken to boss about and then asked you to wash and then you denied it smelling at all is\u2026 a reasonable ask and also the bare minimum.\n\nWhat would you do? Just be miserable?", "THEY DID. Why is this thread full of people who cannot read.\n\nThey DID go to their boss, their boss did nothing. \n\nWhy does this question keep getting asked?", "If someone left food in the employee fridge for months on end to rot and mold, would you also think it was wrong for someone to throw that out?", "If you read their post you\u2019d know their company doesn\u2019t have an HR person, and they already spoke to their supervisor who did nothing.\n\nMy fucking 9-5 is not worth me being disgusted all day long. The asshole is the person who is showing zero consideration to their coworkers for an issue that\u2019s been brought to their attention and a supervisor\u2019s attention without any resolution.", "Are you lacking in reading comprehension maybe? Do words not make sense to you? OP stated ALL the things she had tried, including going to her boss, dropping subtle hints, and straight up asking the coworker to wash the damn thing. Why is she supposed to keep suffering after she tried multiple avenues and nothing worked? The coworker just buried his head in the sand and hoped OP would go away, HE is the one not being mature or professional about this."]}
