While I am not happy with her choice but she is an adult. Because my daughter moved back in I had to pick up extra shifts to cover the expenses (When she was a child we had child support to take care of her) and I have 3 more daughters (12,14,16).\n\nNow my daughter doesn\u2019t have a job tho she is claiming that she is trying to find one. Because of all the extra shifts im pulling I have asked my older daughter to babysit the kids (Pick them up from school and heat the food I have prepared for them and help my youngest with her H/W ) She always complains and says that she should not be doing unpaid labor which I replied to yes you don\u2019t have to if you can get a job to take the load off my back.  \n\nYesterday I got a call from my 16-year-old saying that they have been in school for the past 2 hours and she doesn\u2019t have enough money for the bus. I was livid while I was driving to pick them up (30 minutes away) I was calling my daughter but it kept on going straight to voicemail. I picked my kids up and when I went inside she was just there playing video games.\n\nWe started to argue and then I said you can find a fucking job or get the actual hell out of my house and come back because you're acting like a selfish brat. Both of us stood still for a bit cuz I have never spoken to her like that before she ran out and to her friend's place.\n\nAnd now I\u2019m getting calls from my ex and his family and even some of my own for cursing at her and threatening to kick her out.\n\nAITA", "created_utc": 1675212409, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10qfszi/aita_for_cursing_and_threatening_to_kick_my/", "score": 71, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They van take turns hosting her. NTA", "NTA, how is it unpaid labor if she\u2019s being fed and has a place to live rent free?", "NTA - she is 24, she\u2019s an adult. People fall on hard times, but the least she can do is help out around the house while she\u2019s there. Its not unpaid labor because its covering her free rent.", "NTA at all, not even a little bit.\n\nBut I'd give her an official 30 day notice. You have 30 days to get a job and start paying your fare share, or get out.\n\nAnd if your ex, or anyone else for that matter, starts at you, tell them they are more than welcome to take the GROWN ADULT in and pay for her to play video games all day. If they are unwilling tell them to stfu!", "NTA, your daughter is acting like a spoiled, entitled freeloader and you are well within your right to kick her out if she does not start pulling her weight. She is an adult and needs to start acting like one. If she can\u2019t be bothered to help with her siblings while you work extra shifts to cover her bumming around then she can kick rocks.", "NTA, she's being really bratty and entitled", " NTA- She is 24 years old ADULT.. \n\nmy parents rules were after high school either school, work, meaningful volunteer work or GET OUT. After 6 months of working, you start paying rent to them or a landlord. My kid is 11 yrs old and understands this is the way\u2026 Dad or his family can pay  to house her", "My 13 year old does more for me without even asking!  WTH is up with your daughter?  She was mature enough to quit school and casually move back home, yet not mature enough to put in an effort to help the person she is freeloading off of?  Maybe the explicit language could have been left out, but when you are at the end of your tether, what ya gonna do?   Tell everyone who does NOT reside with you or paying your bills to BUTT OUT and if they don't, she can go live with them.  \n\nNTA!!!!", "NTA it's the least she should be doing! Tell your ex and anyone else with an opinion they can take her in.", "NTA.   She shouldn't do unpaid labor, but she should have a free place to live?  Nice.   You should have thrown her out the day she said that.    \n\nEvery restaurant I see is begging for employees.  She could have a job tomorrow if she wants one, but why should she when she can freeload off you?", "NTA.  She is an adult and needs to pull her own weight.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter is not doing unpaid labour. She is working to pay you rent.", "Nta. She can live with your ex then. She is a full adult and needs to start acting like it. You shouldn't have to work more because your daughter is lazy.", "NTA. And the flying monkeys can take her in. Don't threaten, do it. Pack her off to dad or granny. Sheesh, some people's kids.", "NTA.  Its crazy someone that age would WANT to freeload.  The shame I would feel doing that would be crazy.", "NTA! Sounds like everyone would be happy if she went and lived with your ex", "NTA. You let her stay free of charge with some very reasonable stipulations seeing as you took on extra work to cover the extra person living there. She completely abandoned those reasonable responsibilities and left your kids stranded....to play video games. To have the nerve to be upset with you putting your foot down and showing that she crossed a line is truly entitled of her. If your ex is so livid with you then daughter can go live with them and take on the extra burden.", "NTA. you daughter is being a selfish leech. She is old enough to be responsible and needs to find a job or take on duties in your house. 24 is too old to be sitting on your ass. And she is t working for free - she is doing it for room and board.", "24 and no school.\n\nTime to work or move out.\n\nHave her make a spreadsheet of applications and status.\n\nNTA", "NTA - pick kids up from school, heat already made food, help a 12 year old with homework, that\u2019s literally all you asked her to do until she gets a job well you take extra shifts to care for your 24 year old, i\u2019ve babysat since i was 13, started getting jobs when i was 15 it\u2019s not that hard if she doesn\u2019t want to work well she can help out at home and if she doesn\u2019t want to do either and just live as a freeloader she can do it in another place", "NTA. I\u2019d apologize for the cursing, in order to salvage the relationship.  But she pushed you to a moment of snapping, and we all have those.  But even if you sit down with her and calmly explain your position, you are totally entitled to expect her to work for you in place of paying you rent, or get a job and pay you rent, or get a job and pay her own rent.", "NTA. She\u2019s a grown woman and should be more responsible. You are no longer required to support her. You were angry and sometimes we say things in anger we shouldn\u2019t. Threatening to kick her out of your house was not wrong. Tell her father and everyone else to let her move in with them.", "NTA.", "Nta. The yelling wasn\u2019t stellar but she\u2019s a grown ass adult who should be supporting herself. Time to grow up.", "NTA.  Her helping you is work, however, she is living rent-free in your home.  The expectation is that, with no job, she helps out.  She is old enough that if she doesn't want to contribute to the household, she can move out.", "NTA at all . She is freeloading and complaining on top ! She is an adult for all those calling you tell them to look after her and pay . She is 24 not looking for job or helping and playing games .\n\nShock horror you swore at an ADULT who is being childish and freeloading . Don\u2019t worry she needed to hear that as being polite has obviously got you nowhere", "NTA she\u2019s an adult living for free and can\u2019t be bothered to help. She needs to get a job and pay rent or move out.", "INFO: why can't she live with ex?", "NTA She's a grown adult who took advantage of your kindness. If the ex cares so much they can take her in.", "NTA\n\nShe is no longer a child. She either helps, works or gets out. \n\nTell your ex he\u2019s more than welcome to let her live with him, or he can continue to pay child support for her since she refuses to work.", "NTA. Our rule for our kids was that as adults, they needed to be in school or working. It's never been an issue. Your ex could take her in, but he's not going to do her any favors by letting her sit on her butt playing video games all day.", "NTA she's too old for that dumb shit put her out. No guilt", "I don't think y t a. You shouldn't have cursed and yelled, but I get it. No one wants to take care of someone doing nothing around the house. Just be calmer in the future, firm in your expectations, and if your kid doesn't want to help out, tell her to stay with her other parent. See if they'll be okay with her doing nothing.", "NTA, though I don\u2019t agree with you cursing at her. That could have been done much more tactfully. However, she needs to be helping out at home if she has no job, isn\u2019t contributing toward expenses, and isn\u2019t in school. If your ex and various family members have a problem with you requiring her help to live with you, they can take turns hosting her. \n\nI\u2019ve used this as an example a few times lately but my brother is currently staying with us because of a bad situation at home. He cleans (without being asked), watches my kids from time to time, has a full time job, and contributes toward groceries. If he was just hanging out on the couch playing video games and ignoring us asking for help we\u2019d ask him to leave. It\u2019s a pleasure to host him because he is so respectful of our home.", "Meh.  You aren\u2019t wrong.  Maybe shouldn\u2019t have cursed, but honestly most families do.  You didn\u2019t name call her.  If she comes back, sit down and make new rules.   If she isn\u2019t working at an out of the house at paying job, these are the things she is responsible for inside the house.   She isn\u2019t a slave or free maid, but she IS living for free and causing you to have to work more.   Her choice to drop out of school means consequences in other areas of her life.  When my daughter split from her husband and moved back home, we went to get her from out of state on a Saturday morning.   I let her cry all the way home and all day Sunday.   Monday morning before I went to work I tossed the Sunday Help Wanted Section in front of her and told her that she had a week to find work.  She was a little stunned but Wednesday called me all excited because she found a job and started the following week.   Her friends thought I was HORRIBLE!    No, I wouldn\u2019t have kicked her out as long as she was looking, but I did want her to realize that she couldn\u2019t mooch off us and \u201cbe sad\u201d.   You daughter is old enough to learn there are consequences to our actions.  If \u201cfamily\u201d thinks that is harsh, they are welcome to let her move in with them.", "NTA; she\u2019s a grown up that contributes nothing to the greater good of your household.  Your ex can host the parasite.", "definitely NTA. she's 24 and when her siblings needed her most, she was just sitting there playing video games like a lazy bum. if i was her, i would actually take care of the 3 other daughters and try my best to help the youngest with her hw", "NTA", "NTA. It irks me enough to be busting my ass to make a living and maintain a house while my 13yo and 15yo are sitting around like bums. I would be so pissed at 24yo in that circumstance and probably would have gone off on her like you did. Maybe it\u2019s best for her to get kicked out. Even if she got a job while she was living with you, I could see her saying that\u2019s \u201cher\u201d hard earned money. She\u2019s got a job so you don\u2019t ask her for help around the house, but you\u2019re still having to pull extra shifts to pay the bills.", "NTA. Perhaps, now that youre calm tho, sit down with her. Tell her that she's right, she shouldnt do unpaid labour, and you'll pay her standard babysitting rates. THEN, pull out a lease for her, explain what you'll be expecting toward rent, utilities, and shared groceries. Tell her she has a week to sign and provide a deposit.", "NTA she's doing nothing to contribute to the house but increase the mess and expenses. She's doing \"unpaid\" babysitting because she's getting free rent and food and everything else. She can't be bothered to do a simple thing or answer her phone she needs to leave. Let those who are upset with you cover her expenses", "NTA- she's 24, if she is living with you rent-free she should either be helping around the house or have a job. You did the right thing to stand up for yourself.", "NTA - she was being paid, with a roof over her head. If your ex is so pissed they can take her in for a while.", "NTA tell her you'll pay her for providing child care, but then she needs to pay rent.", "NTA. You should have never taken her in !", "NTA,  she shouldn't trouble finding a job because everyone is hiring. You did right you, she's an adult and she needs to grow up. For your ex, his family, and yours they can house her and take care of her.", "NTA, kick her out. If she\u2019s an adult and unwilling to work, that is not your responsibility to support her. She can go live with your ex and his family!", "Absolutely NTA. You gave her responsibilities that she had to uphold inorder to live there and she broke those responsibilities, and it's not like she's a teenager, she a grown ass woman, if she cant do pretty simple things everyday, she doesn't deserve the privilege to live with you.", "NTA. Sometimes you just have to tell it to them straight. Time to grow up girlie. She should be cooking, cleaning, watching kids & whatever the hell you ask from her in return for living at home.", "Why do parents always get so guilt-tripped into letting grown children live rent free and contribute no favors? Give her a list of tasks she needs to do as in-kind rent and if she doesn\u2019t like it she can get out", "ESH. You weren't wrong, but you definitely could have handled it more tactfully.", "ESH Your daughter is a selfish brat and despite being an adult, she wants all of the perks of being a kid with no responsibilities. You had every right to be angry. You just shouldn't have cursed at her. I would tell her that she has to pay her own way, in either rent or labor. If she is unwilling to do either she can freeload off of someone else.\n\nShe should have learned some responsibility by now. If she hasn't, it is a good time for her to learn.\n\nYour daughter needs to become an independent adult. You wouldn't be doing her any favors by allowing her to be dependent on others in order for her needs to be met. We want our children to eventually be able to provide for themselves.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
