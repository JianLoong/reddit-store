While I am not happy with her choice but she is an adult. Because my daughter moved back in I had to pick up extra shifts to cover the expenses (When she was a child we had child support to take care of her) and I have 3 more daughters (12,14,16).\n\nNow my daughter doesn\u2019t have a job tho she is claiming that she is trying to find one. Because of all the extra shifts im pulling I have asked my older daughter to babysit the kids (Pick them up from school and heat the food I have prepared for them and help my youngest with her H/W ) She always complains and says that she should not be doing unpaid labor which I replied to yes you don\u2019t have to if you can get a job to take the load off my back.  \n\nYesterday I got a call from my 16-year-old saying that they have been in school for the past 2 hours and she doesn\u2019t have enough money for the bus. I was livid while I was driving to pick them up (30 minutes away) I was calling my daughter but it kept on going straight to voicemail. I picked my kids up and when I went inside she was just there playing video games.\n\nWe started to argue and then I said you can find a fucking job or get the actual hell out of my house and come back because you're acting like a selfish brat. Both of us stood still for a bit cuz I have never spoken to her like that before she ran out and to her friend's place.\n\nAnd now I\u2019m getting calls from my ex and his family and even some of my own for cursing at her and threatening to kick her out.\n\nAITA", "created_utc": 1675212409, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10qfszi/aita_for_cursing_and_threatening_to_kick_my/", "score": 164, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No guilt", "I don't think y t a. You shouldn't have cursed and yelled, but I get it. No one wants to take care of someone doing nothing around the house.

See if they'll be okay with her doing nothing.", "NTA, though I don\u2019t agree with you cursing at her. That could have been done much more tactfully. However, she needs to be helping out at home if she has no job, isn\u2019t contributing toward expenses, and isn\u2019t in school. If your ex and various family members have a problem with you requiring her help to live with you, they can take turns hosting her. \n\nI\u2019ve used this as an example a few times lately but my brother is currently staying with us because of a bad situation at home. He cleans (without being asked), watches my kids from time to time, has a full time job, and contributes toward groceries. If he was just hanging out on the couch playing video games and ignoring us asking for help we\u2019d ask him to leave. It\u2019s a pleasure to host him because he is so respectful of our home.", "Meh.  You aren\u2019t wrong.  Maybe shouldn\u2019t have cursed, but honestly most families do.  You didn\u2019t name call her.  If she comes back, sit down and make new rules.   If she isn\u2019t working at an out of the house at paying job, these are the things she is responsible for inside the house.   She isn\u2019t a slave or free maid, but she IS living for free and causing you to have to work more.   Her choice to drop out of school means consequences in other areas of her life.  When my daughter split from her husband and moved back home, we went to get her from out of state on a Saturday morning.   I let her cry all the way home and all day Sunday.   Monday morning before I went to work I tossed the Sunday Help Wanted Section in front of her and told her that she had a week to find work.  She was a little stunned but Wednesday called me all excited because she found a job and started the following week.   Her friends thought I was HORRIBLE!    No, I wouldn\u2019t have kicked her out as long as she was looking, but I did want her to realize that she couldn\u2019t mooch off us and \u201cbe sad\u201d.   You daughter is old enough to learn there are consequences to our actions.  If \u201cfamily\u201d thinks that is harsh, they are welcome to let her move in with them.", "NTA; she\u2019s a grown up that contributes nothing to the greater good of your household.  Your ex can host the parasite.", "definitely NTA. she's 24 and when her siblings needed her most, she was just sitting there playing video games like a lazy bum. if i was her, i would actually take care of the 3 other daughters and try my best to help the youngest with her hw", "NTA", "NTA. It irks me enough to be busting my ass to make a living and maintain a house while my 13yo and 15yo are sitting around like bums. I would be so pissed at 24yo in that circumstance and probably would have gone off on her like you did. Maybe it\u2019s best for her to get kicked out.

She\u2019s got a job so you don\u2019t ask her for help around the house, but you\u2019re still having to pull extra shifts to pay the bills.", "NTA. Perhaps, now that youre calm tho, sit down with her. Tell her that she's right, she shouldnt do unpaid labour, and you'll pay her standard babysitting rates.

Tell her she has a week to sign and provide a deposit.", "NTA she's doing nothing to contribute to the house but increase the mess and expenses.

Let those who are upset with you cover her expenses", "NTA- she's 24, if she is living with you rent-free she should either be helping around the house or have a job.

You gave her responsibilities that she had to uphold inorder to live there and she broke those responsibilities, and it's not like she's a teenager, she a grown ass woman, if she cant do pretty simple things everyday, she doesn't deserve the privilege to live with you.", "NTA. Sometimes you just have to tell it to them straight. Time to grow up girlie. She should be cooking, cleaning, watching kids & whatever the hell you ask from her in return for living at home.", "Why do parents always get so guilt-tripped into letting grown children live rent free and contribute no favors? Give her a list of tasks she needs to do as in-kind rent and if she doesn\u2019t like it she can get out", "ESH. You weren't wrong, but you definitely could have handled it more tactfully.", "ESH Your daughter is a selfish brat and despite being an adult, she wants all of the perks of being a kid with no responsibilities. You had every right to be angry. You just shouldn't have cursed at her. I would tell her that she has to pay her own way, in either rent or labor. If she is unwilling to do either she can freeload off of someone else.\n\nShe should have learned some responsibility by now. If she hasn't, it is a good time for her to learn.\n\nYour daughter needs to become an independent adult. You wouldn't be doing her any favors by allowing her to be dependent on others in order for her needs to be met.

Take five minutes and look up apartment prices in your area, then sit down--with your ex and other family members around, if necessary--and start with the inarguable facts: you cannot afford to work more hours to pay for her food/etc. unless someone watches the kids, so either she pays rent, she moves out, she watches the kids, or they all starve. I bet she hasn't told them that she left her younger siblings at school, when she should have gotten them TWO HOURS AGO, to play video games; detail that because she's proven she can't be trusted, she can no longer watch the kids, and you're not going to let everyone starve, so you'll leave it up to her whether she wants to move out or pay you rent.\n\nThis is where those apartment prices come into handy: bring those out and point out how much an apartment costs per month, how much utilities cost per month, and how much food costs per month.

And let your ex take her and you have to worry about your underage kids. She\u2019s an adult she made her decisions. She had a place to stay. If only she would help out a little bit and she refused.", "NTA - losing your temper was not constructive\u2026 your daughter is 24, when she decided to drop out, why did you let her back into the house??  She is an adult, she needs to be working and paying rent to live somewhere.\n\nSo, that she has sailed, but you need to set good examples for your younger daughters.  So, you need to talk to your daughter calmly and explain the rules.  1.  She has to have a job by the end of the week.  You don\u2019t care if it\u2019s flipping burgers at Mc Donald\u2019s, but she needs to have a job now.  2. Explain what expenses she will be paying for, because she is an adult.  So, you need to stop paying for her stuff, like phone, car insurance, etc.  she needs to pay for those herself.  3.  Since she wants to live at home instead of her own place, she must contribute to to the household by doing chores.  You will give her an itemized list of the rules while she is living under your roof.\n\nWhile she may be an adult, she isn\u2019t self sufficient, she is living under your roof and she will have to follow your rules.  If she doesn\u2019t like the rules, since she is an adult, she is free to move out and live somewhere else.\n\nYou need to make it worse for her to live under your roof than being out on her own.  Your roof includes rules.  Her roof doesn\u2019t.  Anyone calling to complain about this, needs to take her in or stop complaining.\n\nTo the younger ones, you are responsible for their well being until they become legal adults.  While they are teens, you expect them to be figuring out what they want to do when they become an adult.  They can go to school or get a job or both.  They will be expected to be responsible for some of their own bills.  If they choose school, they need to pick a major and a school that is going to get them into their desired career field.  School is not for enrichment and partying, it is to get the degree you need to get the job you want.  So, you and them need to discuss what kinds of careers they want to get into, they can do research on how much those pay, what kind of schooling is needed.\n\nI had a rule with my son, 4 years = degree, job, place to live.  I didn\u2019t care what his field of study was as long as it led to a job that paid enough for him to live on his own.  I would be his port in storm, not his crash pad because he was too lazy to finish his degree and get a job.  I come from a long like of blue collar workers, so I didn\u2019t care if he wanted to be a plumber or an engineer or whatever.  But he had to a plan by senior year.\n\nYour 16 yr old, if she is not in any activities, she needs to be in structured activities or get a job.  My son was in a lot of activities, band, track, etc so I didn\u2019t require him to get a job until he graduated high school.\n\nYou need to stop taking the extra shifts.  Your oldest daughter is acting like a lazy teenager with no responsibilities. Nope, not happening.  She is 24, she needs a job now, and while she is working that crappy job, she can think about and look for a career path to better jobs.  That\u2019s what adults do.  And adult pay their own bills\u2026 you need to start treating her like an adult.  She has rules and consequences.  If she doesn\u2019t follow the rules, the consequences are that she has to go live with someone else.  It is long past time for tough love\u2026 you want her to become a self sufficient independent adult.  You need to start giving her rules and goals to get her going down that path.  \n\nHope this helps.", "NTA. She is an adult and responsible for her own life. Kick her out and let her live with her father.", "NTA. If she isn't paying rent in money, she has to pay rent in tasks and chores. Picking up her siblings and other household tasks are the compensation for her staying in your house. She doesn't seem to understand that *she is the reason* you can't pick up the other kids yourself.\n\nWrite up a chore chart like she's 8 years old. Rent/board is $X per week. She can pay the money or work off the amount. Picking up her siblings is a fixed task that pays $Y per week. The rest can be made up with cooking, cleaning, and other tasks, each with a dollar amount. Other tasks can be negotiated. Tasks must be completed to your satisfaction. If she gets a job then you can renegotiate whether she pays the whole amount in cash or part task, part money.", "NTA. If she was paying rent and contributing to bills it would be different because she would have the rights of any renter in that situation and doesn\u2019t have to help with the kids or nothing . However when you are a adult leech who doesn\u2019t contribute at all financially then at minimum you should be contributing in other ways to help out including in this case rides or watching kids and stuff", "NTA don't let her back in. She can live with your ex", "NTA. She can go to her dads", "NTA. Tell your ex and his family they can take her. She needs to get a job and contribute. This includes chores. If she is living there, then she can help keep the house tidy. She also needs to pay rent. There is absolutely NO reason why your adult child is not working. I have three adult son, two of which live with me. Those two sons both pay \"rent\" and have chores. You are not doing your daughter any favors by letting this slide. If you do decide to let her stay, she needs to have a timeframe on when she will have a job or she is out. No ifs, ands or buts.", "NTA. It\u2019s time to kick that fully grown bird out of the nest.", "NTA, but YWBTA if you allow your daughter to continue this. She sounds self destructive, and having a place she can be warm and fed while contributing and doing nothing only enables that. Your reality check for her was much needed.", "NTA", "I agree that the daughter is being entitled, but only for this situation. The mothers view is only one facet of the equation. I'm saying this as someone whose sibling has done the exact same thing as the post. The necessary context is missing to make a correct judgement on the sister as a person.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nThe eldest daughter has 8 years between her and the sister closest to her in age. The mother is single. The daughter could have been parentified from a young age and this is why she was so vehemently acting out.\n\nOr, she could be acting entitled.\n\nOP states that she has a drop out daughter that moved into freeload and doesn't want to babysit. It's a bare bones description. \n\nThe daughter drooped out of college. Isn't that information necessary to make a true judgment? It's what's causing the freeloading. Why hasn't mom asked about it?  \n\nThe eldest daughter is a woman. A woman in academia can be both targeted and belittled. Or, some other event could have happened that forced the daughter to drop out.\n\nOr, she could just be freeloading because it was too hard.\n\nHowever, I do think that a mother would inquire about it and mention it in a post about the argument that's leading to kicking her daughter out.\n\nThe lack of clarification means that this could be either a daughter being difficult or a daughter in a mental health crisis that mom is either ignoring or won't accept.", "Many redditors want to adapt that part of cultures in which children live with their parents until their early 30s. \"That's caring for your children.\"\n\nWhat they can't stand is the part of those same cultures where the parents are the boss and filial piety is expected.  \"That's abusive.\"\n\nWhat they manifestly do not want is that part of eastern culture where children (who probably lived at home until 30) are expected to house and care for parents in old age. They have \"Put them in the worst nursing home you can find\" as a ready threat.", "Yeah, mom should work those extra shifts gladly and stop with the blame game. She's harshing on her daughter's chill time.", "That's not what I'm saying.  I'm questioning if she's blaming the daughter for something that is not her fault.  Was the mother having problems before?  It's sounds like she expects the oldest to take care of the others everyday.  I do not believe the 24 year old added that much cost to the household."]}
