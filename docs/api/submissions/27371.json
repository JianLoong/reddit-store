{"id": 27371, "submission_id": "16p19z8", "title": "AITA for Rejecting a Disabled Student's Prom promposal?", "selftext": "throwaway for privacy reasons for everyone involved.\n\nSo this happened to me (19 F) last spring, but I'm still getting shit for it so I need to see if I was actually  TA in this situation.\n\nLast spring, I was a senior in high school. I was in a class called \"Mentor Study\" where I was assigned a couple of disabled students to help with homework/classwork/give life advice... etc.\n\nAnyway, there was a boy in this class that I mentored that I'll call \"James\". James is intellectually disabled ( I won't say with what for privacy). But beyond that he's a super sweet and friendly guy that I had become friends with since the spring semester started. Anyway, fast forward to April, people started getting asked out to prom. A few weeks prior, I had already agreed with a friend group of mine to go with this one particular guy. We didn't tell anyone because he wanted to plan an elaborate \"promposal\" of sorts later.\n\none day James comes towards me, with a bunch of teachers and assistants, holding a sign that said \"Will you be my prom date?\" holding balloons, and he was also holding a box of donuts. I smiled, and went up to him and said I was flattered, but I had already agreed to go with another guy. He was super understanding about it, and said we could share the donuts later in class. However it was super awkward as the TA's and teachers awkwardly smiled at each other and patted James on the back as he headed back down the hallway\n\nLater that day, I started getting a lot of nasty stares in the hallway, and a few friends and acquaintances in school started telling/texting me that I was a A-hole and a bitch for telling him no because \"he was disabled\" and that I was ruining his high school experience. I just told them that I already planned to go with someone else, and that I wasn't going to \"pity\" James by going with him just because he was disabled. That semester, I had basically been cast out as the \"major bitch\" of the school, and a campaign started for a bunch of girls to escort him to the prom. Memes and everything had been made of me online. I had to deactivate my Instagram due to the amount of hate I received\n\nMy issue is, I don't think I treated James any differently than any other guy that would have asked me to prom after I already had plans, and didn't see it any differently. It would feel weird and gross to agree only because he has a disability. But apparently my school seems to disagree. despite this, James and I both agreed in class that this awkward encounter wasn't a big deal, and we are still friends to this day, even though now I am in college. I am still getting shit for this to this day... so I wanted to ask AITA? should I have reacted differently or taken him to prom regardless? He did end up going to prom by the way... by the group of girls who started the petition to escort him.", "created_utc": 1695358067, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16p19z8/aita_for_rejecting_a_disabled_students_prom/", "score": 15, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your rejection got him a whole posse of girls. He was lucky \ud83d\ude02\n\nBut seriously, he's a person and, as you said, you treated him normally.", "NTA; the idea that you're required to go out with a guy because he's disabled is all kinds of wrong, and everyone that is sending you hate and calling you names because of it is an AH. \n\nPlenty of non disabled people don't get to have a date to prom too, so I don't get how you rejecting him was any worse than anyone else getting rejected. Plus you were polite and he seemed unbothered by it, so it's bizarre that people are STILL mad about it. Sounds like it's all just about clout for them at this point; unfortunately not much you can do about that", "NTA. Just because someone is disabled doesn't mean that you should treat them differently. I'm sure he was happy that you didn't just go to prom with him out of pity. \n\nThe fact that you're his friend even now proves that you didn't do anything to be ashamed or embarrassed of. And that hum being disabled was not the reason you choose not to go with him.", "NTA. The fact he even wanted to ask you shows you were good to him. I love the idea of a group of girls taking him anyway to make him feel better. That rocks! But to disparage you along the way? That sucks. High school sucks. You\u2019re still friends with him which would be giving him a much longer term gain than a pity date to the prom.", "NTA.  You said no because you said yes to someone else already.  His disability played no part in your decision.  Good for you.  That's what should happen.  The teachers and TA's are major assholes for crowding around when he did this.  Clearly they were expecting you to say yes and if not then hopefully the societal pressure of so many people there would make you say yes.  \n\nFor everyone else eff them.  Being told no doesn't ruin his high school experience.  What does ruin a hs experiences?  Getting a pity yes.  Being bullied for saying no.  (And make no mistake.  What happened to you was bullying.). Don't fret about it anymore.  You handled this as you should have.", "NTA. Wven if you didn't have plans you have no obligation to accept a particular invitation.\n\nI'm concerned that the mentorship program doesn't have a no dating mentees rule for situations like this, where a disabled student has a crush on a mentor who is then pressured to date the disabled student and bullied about saying no.\n\nI would go to the school or to the school board to suggest adding such a rule to hopefully avoid other students being bullied.\n\nThe students who bullied you also weren't interested in dating him.", "Nta, going with him ONLY because he is disabled would be wrong too.you treated him like everyone else. Because he is just like everyone else. You did fine", "NTA\n\nHe isn't entitled to date you just because he's disabled.", "NTA. Promposals (like real proposals!) work best when you already know the answer, AND, I\u2019ll add, the recipient is being asked in a way that\u2019s meaningful to them. Otherwise, it\u2019s just a show for the proposer, and in this case, more so the posse that hyped him up.\nEither A) he had an elaborate plan from the beginning, and not a single person who was in on it stopped to wonder or check if you had plans already or B) his original plan was more modest and got drummed up by the others to this elaborate thing so the letdown was just as dramatic.\nSomeone should have approached you or tipped you off OR if he had just asked without the theatrics then it could have been a normal discussion between two friends. In NO way does this come back as your fault. I\u2019m sorry you got the short end of the stick here.\n\nEdit: spelling and missing info", "Watch Pumpkin and then update us", "NTA, you aren't the Make A Wish foundation for prom dates.
