I was in a class called \"Mentor Study\" where I was assigned a couple of disabled students to help with homework/classwork/give life advice... etc.\n\nAnyway, there was a boy in this class that I mentored that I'll call \"James\". James is intellectually disabled ( I won't say with what for privacy). But beyond that he's a super sweet and friendly guy that I had become friends with since the spring semester started. Anyway, fast forward to April, people started getting asked out to prom. A few weeks prior, I had already agreed with a friend group of mine to go with this one particular guy. We didn't tell anyone because he wanted to plan an elaborate \"promposal\" of sorts later.\n\none day James comes towards me, with a bunch of teachers and assistants, holding a sign that said \"Will you be my prom date?\" holding balloons, and he was also holding a box of donuts. I smiled, and went up to him and said I was flattered, but I had already agreed to go with another guy. He was super understanding about it, and said we could share the donuts later in class. However it was super awkward as the TA's and teachers awkwardly smiled at each other and patted James on the back as he headed back down the hallway\n\nLater that day, I started getting a lot of nasty stares in the hallway, and a few friends and acquaintances in school started telling/texting me that I was a A-hole and a bitch for telling him no because \"he was disabled\" and that I was ruining his high school experience. I just told them that I already planned to go with someone else, and that I wasn't going to \"pity\" James by going with him just because he was disabled. That semester, I had basically been cast out as the \"major bitch\" of the school, and a campaign started for a bunch of girls to escort him to the prom. Memes and everything had been made of me online. I had to deactivate my Instagram due to the amount of hate I received\n\nMy issue is, I don't think I treated James any differently than any other guy that would have asked me to prom after I already had plans, and didn't see it any differently. It would feel weird and gross to agree only because he has a disability. But apparently my school seems to disagree. despite this, James and I both agreed in class that this awkward encounter wasn't a big deal, and we are still friends to this day, even though now I am in college. I am still getting shit for this to this day... so I wanted to ask AITA? should I have reacted differently or taken him to prom regardless? He did end up going to prom by the way... by the group of girls who started the petition to escort him.", "created_utc": 1695358067, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16p19z8/aita_for_rejecting_a_disabled_students_prom/", "score": 330, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

His disability played no part in your decision.  Good for you.  That's what should happen.  The teachers and TA's are major assholes for crowding around when he did this.

Otherwise, it\u2019s just a show for the proposer, and in this case, more so the posse that hyped him up.\nEither A) he had an elaborate plan from the beginning, and not a single person who was in on it stopped to wonder or check if you had plans already or B) his original plan was more modest and got drummed up by the others to this elaborate thing so the letdown was just as dramatic.\nSomeone should have approached you or tipped you off OR if he had just asked without the theatrics then it could have been a normal discussion between two friends.

NTA op, I\u2019m sorry so many are/were horrible to you.", ">This doesn't even factor in that OP is the kid's mentor and needs to keep a proper boundary.\n\nI didn't get into this but 100%; having a mentor take out a mentee for prom seems all kinds of inappropriate. They could have blown up a mentorship just to have the perfect tiktok moment", "Yeh it was agreed as part of the needs assessment he will have done when he joined (I also have a disability so went through the same process). There were a few things he wasn\u2019t able to do / comfortable doing in the lab (we used HF and he was not enthusiastic about getting that on his lap\u2026) but very limited as they had an adapted electric wheelchair for benches and microscopes etc. \n\nWhen I met him I just asked how he wanted to do stuff and he said \u201cI\u2019ll tell you when I need something\u201d so I just hung out with the other lab assistants until he said something. Easiest job of my life!\n\nOh and also technically if there was a fire I was the one trained to use the wheelchair stair thing. However this kid was crazy fit and did a bunch of wheelchair sports. He said no way was he going in the weird slide thing and he\u2019d make his own way out quicker than id be able to get it off the wall.\n\nIf you think I should have done something different always interested to hear!", "OP should have reported all of the at the time."]}
