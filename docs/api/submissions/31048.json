I met all the adults the first night, signed all the paperwork, filled out all the emergency contact information, etc. Everything seemed fine and she has been attending every Wednesday night. \n\nLast night she shows me this group chat thing on her phone. She says that the Youth Group teachers had them all download this private chat thing on their phones and they use it to communicate outside of Youth Group. I immediately was not okay with this at all. In my mind, there is absolutely no reason for adults to be texting children that are not their children for any reason whatsoever without the parents being involved or having knowledge of it. I don\u2019t care if these are church people. There is no reason for it. Not to mention this chat system is sort of like Snapchat so the messages disappear after the other party reads it and vice versa.\n\nI called the lady in charge of the Youth Group program and expressed my concerns. She explained that the chat is for kids to be able to reach out to the adults to talk about things like issues at school, issues with friends or family, depression, etc and for the adults to be able to return advice or assist in prayers regarding the specific issue. She said that the messages disappear so that the kids feel comfortable sharing things and they feel secure knowing nobody else will see what they said. She was very insistent that this was necessary and even argued with me about it. \n\nDuring this phone call she was interrupting me when I was trying to explain how I was feeling, telling me my feelings were wrong, even at one point telling me it was absurd of me think that Christian adults would do anything they shouldn\u2019t be doing with children. So I snapped. I told her it was completely inappropriate and under no circumstances should adults be asking children for their phone numbers and if they want to communicate outside of youth group it should go thru the parents. I then threatened to have them investigated and I posted on my Facebook asking if other parents in town were aware of this private chat that the church is having our kids download on their phones. Many parents responded that they did not know and some were very upset just as I was. I told the lady that my daughter would not be back and she would be attending a different youth group from now on. \n\nMy husband is embarrassed at my behavior and says that I blew this way out of proportion. He wants me to apologize to the church and delete my Facebook post. I believe that my reaction was completely justified and that I did the right thing by expressing my concerns and alerting other parents. So what do you guys think? Was I right to be concerned?

Any adult who tries to shame a parent into turning off their vigilance about other adults is in the service of a wicked power, whether they realize it or no.

The parents still should have been fully informed about it ahead of time and given the opportunity to ask questions and either give permission or opt out. The way they handled it by bypassing the parents was completely inappropriate. The fact that they\u2019re so angry about it and totally reject your concerns shows that if something DID happen because of this app, they\u2019d be too blind to see it or if they did, would probably hide and reject that too. \n\nMaybe the staff they currently have wouldn\u2019t do anything wrong, but the unconditional trust and direct private access to your children that they\u2019re asking you to give them is exactly what draws predators to churches in the first place.

I do volunteer work with youth in a church and this would absolutely not be allowed.

If we must communicate with children it should be through their parents or through things like a mass email that cc\u2019s the parents. \n\nA program that makes the texts disappear sounds absolutely ridiculous. That is not how to protect children. \n\nThe training my church uses is called Plan to Protect. It is Christian and absolutely doesn\u2019t advocate for adults speaking to vulnerable children one on one.", "NTA.  Religious organizations have for a long time attracted predators, this is not isolated to any religion, and spans many.

It is so far beyond what any reasonable person should know happens, that I would question the person saying it.   \n    \nBut even if the people who set it up believed it was for the right purpose, having an app that deletes texts from an authority figure to a child is ripe for abuse.  They set up the perfect tool for a predator to groom young children, and made it so even they couldn't audit or respond to inappropriate behavior.  So even if they were 100% above board, they have prepared a perfect platform for predators.   \n     \nYou were 100% right to be concerned, and I would stay very far away from that group.

They do not get to force children to download an app to a phone without their parent's permission, first of all.  Second, they don't get to try to encourage secrets from parents.

Why would they not be transparent and tell parents up front that's what they asked, have the parents involved, and have a way to ensure someone is reviewing what's happening online to ensure nothing untoward.

Your husband is and the church definitively is. This lack of attention and this respect for church is what led children to be abused. How many victims more do we need before we start realizing that predators use these institutions BECAUSE they are sort of trustworthy and that, because of it, these places and the ones we should distrust the most?\n\nLet's just ask an abused children, what about having an aggressive mom protecting you?", "\"I don\u2019t care if these are church people. \"\n\nI'd say it's even more important BECAUSe they're church people.

Don't trust anyone around your children, especially religious people, especially!!!  The stories I can tell you about \"youth pastors\" would keep you up. So stay vigilant.", "I was going to put this down to both sides having a point at first. OP is right to be concerned but there might be a good reason for kids to reach out to other adults if they have home issues and there might be a good reason for messages to be deleted I could see there being good intentions badly executed. BUT as soon as the parents concerns were dismissed and as soon as the group leader claimed Christian adults would never hurt children that sets up multiple alarm bells. Even IF nothing has happened, this is not a safe person to have responsible for children, this is someone who will dismiss any claims a kid makes about abuse if the perpetrator is seen as a \"good christian\".", "Esh. I can see from both perspectives though I do think the parents should be told, especially for an 11 yo, but they are correct that kids may not share things with their parents, but may with other kids or trust worthy adults. \n\nThink of it this way, if a kid is being abused at home, who might they go to if they wanted to talk or be safe from their parents? If a kid is suicidal and parents dont know or refuse to acknowledge it, would you rather have them talk to a trusting adult or kill themselves? Many children are fortunate to have parents who love and cherish them, but there are also a ton of kids whose parents do not. I think in that case, it is understanding that they'd want to create a safe space for kids to talk. Though personally, snap chat isn't the way to go, and there are safer apps to use or even other more professional resources available. \n\nThat being said, lets be honest and acknowledge that just because someone is Christian, it does not mean they aren't being innaproriate with kids. If that were the case, there wouldn't be pastors, youth leaders, Boy Scouts, and Catholic church molestation and rape cases. So I can completely understand your hesitation and anxiety as a parent. I would be hesitant to, especially if I wasn't told about it, and it was made to seem like it should be hidden from me. Depending on the group, I might have pulled my kid from a program that did the same, especially with a child in that age group\n\nTo be fair, my kids are older now, 13-20, and the underage ones all have access to a channel on discord with a program they were in that is a mixture of youth and adults, but I've known the adult leadership team for years, and have been involved enough in the program to know that it is a safe place for them and their friends. But that trust HAD to be established between me and the team. My kids are also old enough now that they know right from wrong and know they can set boundaries with adults when they are uncomfortable. They also know that if those boundaries aren't accepted, mama bear will step up if they need me to.", "I sponsored CYF at my church for years. But, all practices were approved by our pastor and supported literally by our national council of spiritual elders.  And as the sponsor, I was accountable as a church office holder and the diocese itself establishes guidelines. So, I can appreciate you not wanting what the group leader seeks from the kids. But, she can recommend you remove the student from group or seek the pastor's intervention.\n\nIts kind of like being an employee and in lots of places it isn't free booting. Again I understand why you don't like this aspect. But, you'll have to ask your pastor about changing program policies and dictates, probably? (Personally, I'd hate to lose a kid's participation and growth from group and would simply ask the pastor to approve one child not having the app for contact.

Admin and parents are all able to see them anytime.\nTwo- teachers are certified.  We get background checks and training, we're mandated reporters, and we have trained counselors on site as well.\n\nThere's a place where a child should be able to speak freely without their parents being allowed to hear- in a therapist's office, speaking with a certified mental health professional.  Somehow I doubt that all the folks using that app have their psychology degree.", "\"it was absurd of me think that Christian adults would do anything they shouldn\u2019t be doing with children...\" That statement right there should be a RED FLAG to keep your kid away from this group...\n\nNTA", "NTA.

Absolutely not. \n\nAs others have said, it's your job to protect your children the best you can. \n\nI'm Agnostic (recovering Catholic) and if my kids decided they want to go to church and/or join a youth program I would be on that leader like white on rice. If my kids get heavily involved in sports with a shady background, you bet your ass I'm sitting in the front row reading a book while practice goes on. \n\nNTA.

I met him and thought he was a complete dud. I\u2019m gonna say about 6 months later, my best friends dad went over to the youth pastors house and beat his head in THEN called police, because my friend and youth paster were calling each other basically every night and having phone sex. \n\nI don\u2019t know if anything else happened.. the entire family has wiped it from their collective family history. \n\nTrust your gut mom!!!!", "I just want to say that I was a teacher, and I'd expect to be fired if I participated in something like this.

They were shocked when he \"resigned suddenly\" and the congregation was never told why he \"has chosen to leave to pursue other opportunities\".   \n\n\nIt's a mix of ignorance and arrogance that's all too common in churches, where people like to believe they're part of a special group that's righteous and holy and morally superior to \"the world\".
