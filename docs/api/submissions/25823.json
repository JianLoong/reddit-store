He could have pulled the problem parents aside and explained that their behavior is concerning and he doesn't want unruly children being destructive. Instead he basically threw you under the bus. Guaranteed there will always be hard feelings between them and you specifically. Again, not a great way to start off with his family.

What \"behave\" means, and that if they don't behave, you'll ask their mom and dad to leave and take them home, but if they do behave, you'll have a little surprise treat for them at the gift opening (or whatever next event).", "Hard YTA.

He was the one that suggested not to invite them and it should be his responsibility to clear up any misunderstandings. Hoping that he'll assert with ILs that it was his decision to exclude them and not yours. \n\nILs at least waited till you were back from your honeymoon but are AHs for blaming you solely and accusing you of \"driving a wedge\"", "RB summed it up superbly.

When security is needed they engage as quietly as possible. \n\nFor example I did a lot of the day of running around and coordination for my sister's wedding, and the only reason I knew we had security was because it was a popular venue and because they were directed to me and introduced themselves to me to confirm if there was anyone specifically to watch out for, which there wasn't. They were very good at staying inconspicuous, and honestly if they hadn't introduced themselves, I would have assumed they were just guests from the groom's side that I didn't know.", "I think the same thing, who the heck has security at a wedding, when you aren't expecting  problems.

It was in our contract with the venue, and most places I looked (private halls, our local zoo and science center, even our city hall rotunda) required at least one security guard.  Some supplied their own guards (city hall, the zoo, the science center, and one other venue), and the customer just paid their hourly rate, but most had security companies that they worked with.  We did get the option to have family/friends in Law Enforcement serve as our security, but then they would have had to work the wedding, so we shelled out the $50/hr for the private security.", "If all of the husband's nephews were younger and OP's were in their teens (aside from the babies), they'd probably just let security know the ages that shouldn't be included.", "Very odd.", "Yes.

Do also ask your husband how that initial conversation with them went. Many people are calling him out for being a coward but frankly I think it could just have been an oversight. Basically, we don\u2019t know.\n\nAs for the reception thing - I\u2019m not from US, UK, etc. so I\u2019m not sure, but is there designated seating such that accepting \u2018gatecrashers\u2019 (like the children) is not feasible? If not, it might have been better to just let them in. The idea here is that you guys may not have realised that your family\u2019s kids being invited was an issue, so when you eventually realised it at the reception, a good way to smooth things over would have been to let them in. They may still resent you a little, of course, but can\u2019t be helped at that point in time.", "OP is NTA.
