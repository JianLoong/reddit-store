He could have pulled the problem parents aside and explained that their behavior is concerning and he doesn't want unruly children being destructive. Instead he basically threw you under the bus. Guaranteed there will always be hard feelings between them and you specifically. Again, not a great way to start off with his family.

What \"behave\" means, and that if they don't behave, you'll ask their mom and dad to leave and take them home, but if they do behave, you'll have a little surprise treat for them at the gift opening (or whatever next event).", "Hard YTA.

Everybody always gives the bride the power to make any and all rules but it was 100% the groom\u2019s decision to not invite the kids in his family because he knew they\u2019re badly behaved. The bride has no obligation to go against his wishes and invite them. And she has no obligation to not invite kids in her own family even though she wants them there and they\u2019re well behaved and the groom is fine with it. Both the bride and the groom are entitled to make the rules about who attends their wedding.", "INFO - were the toddlers in the wedding party? Even adult only weddings sometimes make an exception for ring bearers and flower girls.", "NTA. your wedding, do whatever you want to do. No one is entitled to an invitation - kids or adults", ">When we were planning the wedding I said I wanted to have the children in my family at the ceremony and the reception. Husband said he didn\u2019t mind but he didn\u2019t want to invite his nephews. He finds them too rowdy and active and he\u2019s had bad experiences with them at other family events so he\u2019d rather they weren\u2019t at the wedding.\n\nNTA. Maybe their parents shouldve taken the time and effort to teach their kids how to behave around otherd.", "ESH - Unfortunately you'll be expected to take the blame from ILs. \n\nDon't think you're necessarily to blame, you should be able to have the wedding you want without having to compromise. \n\nHusband is definitely the AH for not being firm on reasoning as to why nephews from his side weren't invited. He was the one that suggested not to invite them and it should be his responsibility to clear up any misunderstandings. Hoping that he'll assert with ILs that it was his decision to exclude them and not yours. \n\nILs at least waited till you were back from your honeymoon but are AHs for blaming you solely and accusing you of \"driving a wedge\"", "RB summed it up superbly. ESH", "Husband is definitely a bit of an AH. He tonally threw his new wife under the bus!", "My cousin pulled this with our kids.  Had a no kids wedding, fine, We showed up and there were kids everywhere. I get it, we have 5 kids, that is a lot.  But they are well behaved.  And they come to EVERY holiday at our house.   Then about 5 years later my son was getting married (He was 17 at the time of her wedding and very hurt he was not invited) guess who he did not invite?  She was very upset, so sorry, if she could do it all over again...blah, blah, blah...", "Im.just gonna say that you guys probably lost his side of the family over this.", "And how did you see that going down?\n\n\"Well there are plenty of kids coming, just not your little hellions, *Sharon*\"\n\nESH, because trying to sneak your kids in is just weird, but you and your new husband suck too", "Sure but expect people to cut you out of their lives over it. He probably just lost his family relationships.", "It isn\u2019t different.\nBut your husband ff up, and now he needs to have a difficult conversation with his family about why His nephews and nieces weren\u2019t invited and yours were. And he needs to do it soon!\nBut quite frankly, I think that this\u2019ll stand between you guys and your husbands family for ever. Because where it is easier to exclude certain adults at a wedding, it is a big no to just exclude one half of the children because they are too rowdy. \nI agree that you guys then should have said like no children under 12 ore something, because you basically said:\nHIS nieces and nephews are shittie children and can\u2019t come but yours are nice and can come.", "\u201cWe\u2019re asking the brides family to cover the venue and food. The grooms family will cover flowers, music and the bouncer.\u201d", "I've been to quite a few, but they were Jewish weddings at my temple from when I was temporarily living in the southern US, so I can't vouch for it even being the norm for this particular temple.\u00a0I happened to be there when there was a lot of antisemitic vandalism at this particular location so that's more why they were there.", "To be fair, the whole point is that you don\u2019t notice them. They're not standing around with sunglasses and white wire earpieces, most security I've seen just mill around and keep eyes on the doors for non-guests and blacklisted persons, and on the bar for guests who the couple would prefer not to get intoxicated. When security is needed they engage as quietly as possible. \n\nFor example I did a lot of the day of running around and coordination for my sister's wedding, and the only reason I knew we had security was because it was a popular venue and because they were directed to me and introduced themselves to me to confirm if there was anyone specifically to watch out for, which there wasn't. They were very good at staying inconspicuous, and honestly if they hadn't introduced themselves, I would have assumed they were just guests from the groom's side that I didn't know.", "I think the same thing, who the heck has security at a wedding, when you aren't expecting  problems.  I have read a few stories, where, for various family  issues, they are expecting problems.  Also, who, once they realize other kids are there, leaves and goes get their kids from wherever they  are", "Ummm, my wedding (in the Midwestern US) was at a hall, and we were required to pay for security, 1 guard per 70 guests, so 3 guards total. It was in our contract with the venue, and most places I looked (private halls, our local zoo and science center, even our city hall rotunda) required at least one security guard.  Some supplied their own guards (city hall, the zoo, the science center, and one other venue), and the customer just paid their hourly rate, but most had security companies that they worked with.  We did get the option to have family/friends in Law Enforcement serve as our security, but then they would have had to work the wedding, so we shelled out the $50/hr for the private security.", "If all of the husband's nephews were younger and OP's were in their teens (aside from the babies), they'd probably just let security know the ages that shouldn't be included.", "Very odd.", "Yes. Or at least have a conversation with him about what he planned to say to them or what he actually said. Communication is key.", "He probably didn't given how he cowardly backed out of telling the truth (I don't want my nephews there) and instead claimed there would be no children. Because now they've seen all HER side of the family there with children it'll be easy to place the blame fully on the new wife and never let her forget it. Like, ever. I doubt hubby will stand up and tell the truth post screw up.", "Not just in the south, every Jewish wedding (or at least wedding at a Jewish venue) that I\u2019ve attended had mandatory security", "What kind of venue was it? I've been to weddings at aquariums, hotels, zoos, and freaking disney world... none of them had security that was specific to the wedding. Disney world, for example, definitely has security but none of them worked the wedding. There was a sign on the door of the specific location that it was closed for a private event, that's it. The aquarium probably has security, and the wedding took place after hours so security was probably present somewhere in the building but again they were not there to work the wedding."]}
