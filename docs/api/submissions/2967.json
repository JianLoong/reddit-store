He and his fianc\u00e9e Anna have been together for several years. They have a daughter together and Anna has two boys from a previous marriage. They just decided to finally have an official ceremony.\n\nBut before I get into the wedding, I need to explain why I\u2019m not so enthusiastic about it:\n\nI\u2019ve felt a lot of animosity towards my brother lately. His fianc\u00e9e is very controlling and selfish. She always insists on doing holidays and special occasions with her family and completely leaves our mother out of it. She\u2019ll happily pack up the kids on a Sunday to go visit her parents, but if our mom wants to see her grandkids, she has to drive 30+ minutes to their house. My mom is blind in one eye, so longer drives can be hard for her and she can\u2019t drive at night under any circumstances. Anna and my brother are also very picky about the time that our mother can come visit because they\u2019re \u201cvery busy\u201d, so it\u2019s always on their terms, and it\u2019s not uncommon for times to get changed or cancelled at the last minute. \n\nAnna\u2019s also constantly posting pics on Facebook of them, the kids, and her parents doing activities that my mother is never invited to. My brother says that all of this bothers him, but he won\u2019t say anything to Anna about it.\n\nTo make matters even more infuriating, they behave this way despite the fact that our mother has provided them with immense financial support over the last few years. We\u2019re talking tens of thousands of dollars. Bailing them out when they fell behind on their mortgage, buying them a car, paying for their upcoming wedding, etc. She would do anything for them despite their neglect. \n\nThis has been going on for years now. They call her when they need money, our mother takes it out of her retirement $ even though she knows she shouldn\u2019t do it, and then they go back ignoring her. It\u2019s painful to watch, and I\u2019ve honestly had it. \n\nNow to the main question. My brother and Anna are now planning their wedding. We were all at our mother\u2019s discussing some of their plans, when Anna just turns to me and says \u201coh yeah, we scheduled the wedding on your birthday. You\u2019re not upset about that are you?\u201d As if it matters at this point - you\u2019ve already set the date and paid the deposit!\n\nOf course I said nothing because I didn\u2019t want to sound like a selfish brat, but the more time has gone on and the closer it gets to the wedding, the more annoyed I get.  They behave so selfishly towards our family all the time and break our mother\u2019s heart routinely, but I\u2019m supposed to smile and give up my birthday celebration to go to a wedding for two people I\u2019m not very fond of at the moment?\n\nMy mother says I should go because Anna\u2019s family is much larger and my brother won\u2019t have as many people coming on his side. I still don\u2019t want to go. I\u2019m not in the wedding party or anything, so my not being there won\u2019t have any effect on the ceremony. \n\nSo WIBTA if I don\u2019t go?", "created_utc": 1669121291, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z1sr4w/wibta_skipping_brothers_wedding_for_my_bday/", "score": 90, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Did they give you a reason why they chose that date?", "Your situation is eerily similar to my family. Only difference is no kids. My wife\u2019s brother married someone like Anna. Her family was huge, and very important to her. They did everything together because that\u2019s the way her family operated. Holidays, life events big and small, everything was a family event. My BIL is also just clueless. Very intelligent, but absolutely clueless when it comes to situational awareness. So he had no idea the effect that them always choosing his wife\u2019s family had on his family. It took my wife sitting down and saying something to him about how it was affecting their mom for him to even realize it. He just assumed everyone was happy and everything was ok. Now several years later time is evenly split and everyone gets along well. All it took was someone opening his eyes. \n\nSorry for the incoherent rambling. I say it all to say that you need to talk to your brother about this. Make him aware of the effect it\u2019s having on the family and your mom. Not saying your situation is the same as mine, but I\u2019ve learned in life that people can really be thick idiots incapable of seeing the obvious signs in front of them. \n\nEither way NTA.

So if it was just that your birthday was the best day that would work in the time that they wanted to get married, I\u2019d say you\u2019d be wrong to skip it.  But the bigger concern here is the pattern of disrespect, manipulation and micro-aggressions. \n\nI\u2019d say you\u2019re NTA for taking a stand, but I\u2019d recommend talking to your brother *separately from Anna* and bringing up the points you made above, and ask why your birthday was chosen.

He\u2019s the one holding his child hostage. He\u2019s the one who is refusing to visit. Trust me.. if he truly wants to visit your mom he would.

He should be the one driving them to see your mother. It isn't SIL's job. Would it be nice if she did it? Sure. But his family is his responsibility, and he is the one neglecting it, not her. She may well be a shitty human being, but the only thing I'm sure of out of this is that your brother is an arsehole.

My mother treats Anna\u2019s kids as her own grandkids and always has. They have become a part of our family and are always treated as such. I don\u2019t buy that Anna has zero obligation to consider my mother just because they\u2019re not blood related, particularly since she and my brother have clearly decided as a couple that Anna calls the shots when it comes to family activities.\n\nHowever, it absolutely is my brother\u2019s responsibility to stand up for his mother and ensure that she gets time with his family even if it means he needs to get up and drive the kids over to see her himself. He does not do this, nor does he advocate for his mother to Anna even though he\u2019s well aware of how much it hurts her. He is an AH for this and I am very upset with him for it.", "I totally agree with you and didn\u2019t mean to imply that Anna should be solely responsible for taking the kids for family visits.

There\u2019s no reason both of them can\u2019t come to visit our mother.\n\nI\u2019m angry with both of them. I do feel Anna is the active influence in the situation because she makes all of the family decisions, but my brother in no way gets a free pass for his tacit approval. He should bring the kids to come see their other grandmother, with or without Anna.", "yeah, I have a cousin who is like this. His wife definitely prefers her family. So even though his kids are the closest great-grands, my grandma sees my nieces- who live a 3 hour airplane ride away- more frequently.\n\nI see how hard it is on my aunt seeing my parents have the relationship with their grandkids that they want to have with their grandkids.\n\nBut ultimately, it's on my cousin to make the effort to take his kids to see our family. Yes, his wife wants to spend time with her family. But my cousin is an adult, who can make his own decisions.\n\nHe's decided that spending time with our side of the family just isn't that important to him. Is his wife an influence on that? Sure but it's still his choice at the end of the day.", "You\u2019re correct. The issue is their prolonged neglect of our side of the family. The wedding being scheduled on my birthday is just adding insult to injury at this point. And in my mind, my attendance has sort of become symbolic of this idea that we\u2019re all supposed to just keep smiling and acting like my brother and SIL aren\u2019t being incredibly selfish, which I\u2019m running out of patience for very quickly.", "Yes it\u2019s the way she\u2019s (SIL) going to justify her future negligence towards OP and mother. It will only get worse as time goes on. I would sit down with mom, brother, and SIL and express why you are upset, angered, and done with the disrespect. If that doesn\u2019t go well, then don\u2019t attend. Your brother needs to really step up here, it\u2019s his responsibility to defend his family.

HE Has the capacity to take the kids and come see mom, even if his wife doesn\u2019t want to come, too!  HE has the capacity to ask that his mother be included in family celebrations - let him open him mouth and get off his ass!\n\nMy maternal grandmother joined us for all holidays with my paternal family because she was widowed with only one child.

That's the grooms problem to explain why OP doesn't support the marriage because brother and SIL are shitty people, and to explain why they chose brothers birthday instead of Amy other days for their wedding.", "I think your brother has the responsibility of making sure the kids see his mother. Your brother is equally responsible of all the decisions the family makes. If he doesn\u2019t do the right thing, he is to be blamed.\n\nI feel you are enabling his behavior by belittling his responsibility, same way as he is belittling his own responsibilities and letting SIL make the decisions. He is a grown man.", "I hear what you are saying there, but I still think you are giving your brother a bit of a pass on this.\n\nI don't think they are equally accountable - I think he's MORE accountable than Anna is.  It's not odd that a spouse is going to favor going to see their own family, if they have a close relationship with them.  It's up to the other spouse to push for equal priority for their own family.  \n\nOn a side note - I also want to agree with another commenter.  While I don't think you are TA... I think you should go to the wedding.  Giving a personal experience here.. (again, nothing to do with TA verdict, but rather advice/thoughts).  \n\nI flew back to my hometown for a wedding a couple of weeks ago.  The bride's parents (my family) have a number of issues with the groom + groom's parents.  Some of it is legitimate.  Some of it is not.  Due to some issues (comments made to them by the groom + his parents), the bride's parents ended up leaving the wedding 5 minutes after they got there.  \n\nDo you know who really won here?  The groom's parents.  Because at the end of the day - even though (for them leaving the wedding), they were 80-90% (maybe even 100%) at fault... ultimately, the bride's parents missed the wedding.  And the groom's parents were able to control the spin - because the bride's parents were gone.  (and I was one of the only other family member of the bride there).  \n\nAssuming your goal is to have contact/relationship with your brother & his family in the future, I'd say go to the wedding.  Otherwise, it just fuels this going forward.  Even if you do it more for your mom - than your brother.  Not going is letting Anna win. \n\nAgain, you are absolutely in __no___ way TA.  Just my thoughts - having recently went through a related situation.", "Yes, exactly. Attached this wedding symbolizes you support their marriage when you dont. You don't support how SIL treats the family and is controlling, and you don't support how your brother does nothing about it. Going to the wedding will just further affirm this behavior, just like your mom giving money to them every time also further affirms their behavior.\n\nEdit: a word", "Again, you are blaming the SIL. It is their wedding, they decide the day together, they both treat your family badly- blame your brother!", "Op, don't go, don't let them think everything is cool and they can act like entitled jerks, stand by your mother and let them know where you stand. Or better take your brother aside, tell all that is in your heart and let him know your path forward. Anyway NTA", "I would maybe go to the wedding and then never attend any anniversary celebrations that were placed on my birthday. Your brother definitely needs to speak up more and other commentors were right if you don't  attend this will likely just speed up your inevitable isolation from them.", "Because not going will put her mother in the middle of a conflict between her offspring, and her B and SIL sound like the type of abusive people who will use that to their advantage.    Her primary concern is her mom, so she should suck it up and be the more mature person.  It\u2019s one day.  If she wants to be petty, wear something absolutely garish - red sequins and feathers sound nice.  And in the meantime focus on how to stanch the flow of $ from her mom to her B.", "OP did say in a comment that they are angry at their brother too, but that doesn't excuse SIL behavior.

The second one is just childish and silly, people need to quit acting like their birthday is such a big fucking deal that everyone around them needs to plan around it. That\u2019s what 16 year olds act like, not adults. Grow up.

Keep your opinions to yourself.   Marriage is hard enough without every person throwing in their two cents about your partner.\n\nAlso, since you aren't a child, I hope you can understand how your brother's wedding should be the primary focus and not your bday.
