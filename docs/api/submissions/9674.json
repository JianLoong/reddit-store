My sister Amanda29 also lives with us. We have an agreement, she doesn\u2019t have to pay rent, but help with groceries and watch the girls when needed or get them to or from school. \n\nOur daughter Madison is a lot of work. She skips school, and sneaks out. I\u2019ve found vapes in her bedroom, and weed pens. Amanda was very similar to Madison At this age.\n\nOur dog had gotten out a few days ago, so I was replaying our outdoor video cameras to see if he came back for the food I left out in the middle of the night. Instead I see Amanda leaving then pulling up again around 45 minutes later at 3 am. She then gets out of her car, goes around to the passenger side and pulls out Madison, who is literally stumbling, Amanda\u2019s practically carrying her in. You could tell she was drunk. I was so mad, I went straight to Amanda\u2019s room and asked her what the hell that was.\n\nShe then admitted to me that Madison had called her really drunk, she had snuck out. She then told me that Madison begged her not to tell us. I was so livid, Madison was home that day from school because she was puking, I thought she caught a bug when she was just super hung over.\n\n I started yelling that she couldn\u2019t keep things like that from us, and that Madison is 14 and we should\u2019ve been notified immediately. I told her she betrayed my trust. Amanda just quietly apologized. I left the room and a few minutes later I could hear her crying. Madison is now grounded, and refuses to talk to Amanda for \u201cratting her out,\u201d and Amanda been mostly in her room. My husband told me earlier that Amanda was talking to him about how guilty she feels for upsetting me so badly. He said she seemed really upset. I feel bad because it\u2019s days later and she\u2019s still upset, but she has to know she can\u2019t do those things.\n\nInfo: before my sister moved in my daughter has called me many times to pick her up in the middle of the night. She knows she can call me. I\u2019m quiet when I pick her up, there\u2019s no yelling or arguing. But she does have consequences the next day.

It's got to do with your daughter's trust and sense of self.  She most likely didn't want to embarrass herself in front of you and lose face.  She knows she did the wrong thing and will hopefully learn from it.  Perhaps she didn't want you to judge her more because of your previous experiences with her behaviour  She didn't need to feel any worse than she was.  \n\nThe good thing is that she had Amanda to call so she could be safe.  If Amanda wasn't there, your daughter may have chosen to call no one and be in a much more dangerous position than she was.\n\nGoing off your nut like that only solidified Amanda and Sarah's reasoning for not telling you.  They may get even more secretive even if Amanda moves out.\n\nMadison needs some help and some boundaries.  But she needs to know that you will actually be supportive rather than punitive.  There do need to be consequences for her behaviour but natural consequences go a lot way rather than just taking stuff off her and grounding her.  She would've felt like crap and she may have needed to clean some vomit up and change her sheets... and also clean the rest of her room.\n\nMaybe when your anger settles you can have a chat with them.  Start with Amanda but it's Madison that you really want to talk to.  She may be able to tell you what happened and what she may be able to do to avoid that.  It's not about being permissive at all but she doesn't trust you.\n\nAs a parent, yes you should've known.  But if you didn't have Amanda, your daughter could be in a much worse position right now.  Madison needs to know you will be there for her no matter what.", "I\u2019m actually surprised at seeing so many YTA comments. Why are none of you talking about how dangerous it is for a 14 year old to be sneaking out and getting drunk. Obviously as her mom op is worried and will have to give her punishments and if she doesn\u2019t want to face the consequences of her actions she should not be sneaking out of her house and drinking. \n\nNTA op and the fact that she has called you before shows that she knows you will come to her rescue\n\nEdit: corrected a word", "NTA.\n\nSome people are going to tell you that you\u2019re the AH because your daughter needs someone to be able to call in that type of situation, and there\u2019s some truth in that. But as a mother I am adamant you are NTA!!!! When a young teen is that drunk it can become a medical concern. It would be like if you had a baby and the baby got hurt and your sister didn\u2019t tell you. What if your child had alcohol poisoning? Fuck what your sister thinks, she doesn\u2019t have to live there. \n\nAlso, I would talk to your daughter and let her know that she can call you if something like that ever happens again. That she\u2019s going to get in more trouble if she is deceptive and hiding things, and that she won\u2019t get in trouble if she is honest and forthcoming. \n\nBottom line- that\u2019s your child and not your sister\u2019s, so it should be you calling the shots in your home.", "I\u2019d just be happy my daughter trusted someone enough to call to get her out of a bad situation. If she told on ur daughter she would break that trust. Would u rather her walk home drunk or get a ride from a stranger or drunk friend. I don\u2019t think ur the AH but neither is ur sister.", "NTA - as her parents, you are legally responsible for her health and well-being. You should have been told. \n\nMy first guess is that Amanda was so quiet and is acting so down because she feels guilty. It makes sense she would have felt incredibly conflicted about telling you vs betraying your daughters trust. Additionally, it\u2019s possible she was thinking of Madison\u2019s well-being. If Madison knows she\u2019s \u201csafe\u201d to call Amanda, she will before the shit really hits the fan. \n\nMy advice is: go talk to Amanda. Take her out to do something sistery and have an open and honest conversation with her about the incident, about Madison, and about why she chose to handle it the way she did.\n\nAnd as long as you\u2019re in a reflective mood, consider this: the next time your wild child decides to make a dumb decision that leaves her wasted and out of her depth at 2am, who will she call? And why did she feel she couldn\u2019t call you?\n\nTrying to deal with your daughters destructive behaviors must be incredibly frustrating and more than a little bit frightening, but simply cracking down harder isn\u2019t working on anything but making her sneakier. Maybe a little insight into why will give you the tools to do what discipline alone can\u2019t.", "NTA, but you should probably be a little less nonchalant about a 14 year old getting high and drunk like it\u2019s a normal or regular occurrence. This is ridiculous, a 14 year old running the streets! But then her consequences are to do extra chores or no video games, like a REGULAR 14 year old. No way in hell I would let my 14 year old be in the streets like that. Y\u2019all need some counseling or something to get a grip on these issues.", "NTA absolutely not. You should have been made aware instantly - given your daughter was throwing up she easily could have aspirated in her sleep - did your sister make sure she was on her side? Or check on her during the night?", "YTA. Your sister was put between a rock and a hard place. She had to choose between being loyal to your daughter or being loyal to you and she rightfully chose your daughter. \n\nYour daughter is in a vulnerable place and needs an ally more than you do. You owe your sister an apology. I wonder if your sister could have told you without you having a meltdown. Are you jealous of the relationship that your daughter has with your sister?", "Very soft YTA. You were understandably concerned about your very underage daughter drinking, but should have taken a beat to calm down and consider a few things:\n*  While your sister agreed to watch your kids when you aren't around,  you're the parent. It's your responsibility if your kid is sneaking out after you go to sleep at night.  Not hers.\n*  You should be more concerned that your kid didn't feel she could call you when in what I would call a dangerous situation.  \n*  Your sister seems to understand that she's in a no-win situation.  Your daughter needed immediate adult help from someone she trusts and by someone who wouldn't make a bad situation worse. Your sister knew she would pay a price with you by putting your daughter first, given the immediate apology she offered.\n*  You don't know what was said on that ride home. I sincerely doubt your sister was supportive of dangerous behavior that pulled her out of a warm bed at 3 a.m.  She's not a co-conspirator; she's attempting to parent a child who doesn't trust you. \n*  Thank goodness your sister responded to your daughter and got her home safely!\n\nYour worried/angry energy is misdirected.  In order to make sure your daughter had someone in the house she trusts, your sister kept a secret.  Small price to pay for immediate safety.  Rather than blow up that relationship,  you could have easily told your daughter you saw the video and that your sister didn't betray her trust. Separately, you should have THANKED your sister for getting your kid home in one piece and talked with her about how to handle similar situations in the future.  But job one is talking to your kid about why she felt she couldn't call you and rebuilding that relationship.  Her safety is the primary concern  here, not who to blame.", "NTA; A 13 year old in my school died from alcohol poisoning when I was in school. I would be going to family therapy with her though to see if there's anything that can be done about her behaviors/possible start of addictions.", "Congratulations, you've now removed from your daughter's trust the one adult she felt she could call when she was in trouble. What do you think she'll do next time she needs help?\n\nYTA", "NTA Your daughter is still a minor and drinking alcohol at that age will have its consequences. Your sister Amanda is neither the legal guardian nor a parent, she is just the aunt.\nDon't forget what could have happened. For example, what if Madison drank too much alcohol and ended up in the hospital with alcohol poisoning? She's still a teenager, and sometimes teenagers do stupid things and try new things. \n\n\n(For heaven's sake, I don't want to sugarcoat the idea that sneaking out and drinking is a good thing at her age)\n\n\nTalk it over with your daughter as she probably won't trust anyone and explain things to her what could have gone wrong, I mean, what if Amanda didn't answer the call and stayed asleep? \n\n\nEnglish is not my first language, so forgive me for any grammatical and spelling mistakes.", "YTA be grateful your daughter has someone she trusts?! Next time she'll just call nobody - so end up sleeping in a bar somewhere, getting in a cab with a dodgy driver, staying at the house of someone awful, sleeping on a street for a night - wouldn't you MUCH MUCH rather she just called someone she trusted to bring her home?! \n\nYTA so much and I don't even think you can fix this.", "YTA for the way you delivered your message to your sister. You'd probably have the same vote from me if you'd asked if you were TA for how you handled it with your daughter, as well. \n\nA 14-year-old girl (esp assuming you're in the US) should absolutely not be out getting plastered. That said, your daughter had the maturity to realize she needed a safe way home and made the right call to get that accomplished. Your sister saw that your niece needed a safe way home and provided that. And the ONLY reason she was able to is because your daughter trusted her. That trust between them has now been broken, because you blew up at them both. \n\nOP, ask yourself: since it sounds unlikely that your daughter's decision to party underage was a one-off and will never happen again, how do you suppose she will handle herself the next time she needs a sober ride home? Who will she call now? Handle the discipline however you and your husband see fit (and I'd suggest seeking therapy for all, if you haven't done so yet), but you need to give your daughter praise for taking a responsible step in reaching out to her aunt that night. And you owe your sister an apology for how you treated her.\n\nEdited for clarity", "YTA Here's the thing. Your daughter thought she had someone safe she could call, and now she doesn't. What happens the next time she sneaks out and gets drunk? She's not calling Amanda, or you. Mayne she gets in a car with friends who have been drinking. Maybe she gets behind the wheel. Maybe she spends the night with other drunk kids and maybe one of them isn't super concerned with her inability to consent. These are all worse situations than your sister picking her up and bringing her home safely.", "Forget Your sister. You should be worrying about your KID. How did you not know that your kid wasn't home at midnight? How did she even get somewhere with alcohol?\n\nYour kid needs to switch schools. No more phone. No internet. No unsupervised visits with her friends. \n\nYour daughter's behavior isn't going to stop just because you yelled at your sister.", "ESH Your sister needed to tell your daughter that \"No, I won't keep secrets from your parents for you but I will help deliver the news of the incident in a way that helps you.\" She could've been there for her and been her advocate while still keeping you informed. However, this could've been a conversation instead of a shouting match. It made your daughter feel more isolation which is not going to help whatever substance use/impulse control issues she's having. Try doing some reparative work now and maybe save the relationships.", "ESH You shouldn't have yelled. She shouldn't have hidden this from you. By doing that it is like she condoned the behavior. Madison shouldn't blame your sister for ratting her out. Madison was found out because you were looking at security footage.\n\nYour daughter is in danger any time she sneaks out and you have no idea where she is. Something needs to be done in order to keep her from doing this. Maybe door and window alarms. She is probably friends with other kids who are doing the same thing. If there is a way to get her interested in something like Horseback riding or something, where she could meet people who have interests other than getting drunk and high.", "Look OP as a mom of a daughter NTA, she should have told you.  The rule should always be that as a non parent, they will help their niece or nephew out, but parents will be told.   So NTA\n\n\nBut....YTA for not nipping this is the bud with your kid.  You have stated you have picked her up multiple times.  She is 14, not 17, not 18.  I didn't sneak out or come home past curfew, or come home super drunk till 17.  At 14, yea smoking and chilling in my room or with friends for a bit, not any of this.\n\n\n\nYou need way tougher consequences with her, and your sister being the cool aunt, who likely would have never told you, isn't going to help things.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Next time she will let a drunk 15 year old drive her home or spend the night in an unsafe place because she has no one. OP. You\u2019re probably the reason your kid acts out. Go to therapy. Add family therapy to the list. Every child needs someone they can call when they are unsafe. Your child clearly would never call you.

You\u2019re a huge part of it.", "Going against the grain to say ESH. \n\nYour sister should have told you, yes, and she shouldn't have promised your daughter she'd keep it from you - you needed to know. Shes TA for that. But by blowing up at her, especially before confronting your daughter, you destroyed the trust your daughter had in her, and made it less likely your daughter will feel safe calling *you* as she has in the past. That makes you TA as well. She's at an age where she needs every trusted adult she can get, particularly mentors who have been through similar things, and especially if she has a problem with drugs and alcohol (which it sounds like she might). Now, she can't call you without fear you may blow up at her like you did to your sister, and she can't call your sister without fear of you being told and blowing up at both of them. \n\nHad you gone to her first, explained your concerns over the camera footage you saw, and asked her to come clean, it would have allowed you to reinforce your relationship with her. Then you could have gone to your sister and told her off for keeping this from you, without wrecking their relationship. \n\nThat aside though... if this is something your daughter does regularly, you need to get her help. Substance abuse is a very dangerous spiral - don't wait until it's too late. Is she using this to cope with something else? Is it a social thing? Having a serious talk with her is a good start, and consider getting her a therapist as well. She's potentially just lost trust in 2 mentor figures, and if she's already struggling, that could easily push her over the edge.", "ESH-You clearly indicate this is a recurring issue for your daughter at only 14 years old, and you don't seem to have taken it seriously enough to get her in rehab and help.\n\nIf she's drinking enough until she can barely walk regularly, you need to step up and get her some serious help quickly before she dies from alcohol poisoning or is in an accident.\n\nAmanda sucks because she could have pulled you aside at some point calmly and asked how you wanted to address the situation. Instead, she withheld vital information and acted like she's the parent.\n\nWhat if Madison had been assaulted or severely dehydrated or had too much in her bloodstream? You wouldn't have known what to tell the doctors.\n\nIMO, you need a reality check that this situation requires immediate professional intervention for Maddie and setting some boundaries with Amanda about knowing her place and overstepping.", "I didn't vote YTA, but I understand why. \n\nThat is indeed dangerous. But so far OP has failed to address that in any successful way. OP can't even get her kid to go to school reliably. \n\nFor whatever reason, OP can't manage Madison's behaviour. Until that can be solved, you want to keep Madison as safe as possible while she is doing these things. \n\n> she has called you before shows that she knows you will come to her rescue\n\nNo, that shows that she once trusted her mother to help her.

Telling her that how she handled it is not the way you want it handled (and then clearly explaining how you expect things to go in future) without your daughter present would've gotten you and your sister on the same page, while still preserving the trust and bond between her and the child who is floundering. Now, if your sister repeated her mistake, that's a fuck up she would have to own.\n\nAll of this sounds like your daughter is in some really serious trouble and needs some significant help, before she ends up in a terrible situation as a result of terrible decisions.

You might have left over anger from your childhood since you yelled at her so ferociously. Were you upset that she did those things when she was younger and upset your parents? She now could be a resource for you because she knows what your daughter might be going through and she is adult enough to see where it could end up. You also have removed a 'safe' person from your daughter's life- should she have told you, yes. Maybe she was waiting to have a conversation with you so she could explain some things to you.\n\nIn short, you reacted badly to this situation. Go apologize to your sister and talk to her. Ask her about her childhood-why did she do what she did and what turned her around. Don't ask her to divulge anything that your daughter might have told you but thank her for being there for her. Then you and your husband get your daughter the help that she needs. A little teen rebellion is expected but your daughter is on the path to destruction.

While I can understand wanting to know, you should start by talking to your sister and explaining your point of view.  I can see where she was coming from in wanting to be there for her niece.  Both sides have legitimate points.  By yelling at your sister instead of talking to her, you're breaking your trust with you sister and demoralizing her when she likely had good intentions.
