NTA", "NTA I play candy crush and the first thing I want to ask is how much money is he spending on it? You only get so many lives, which get filled back up over time, so if he is playing it constantly he might be spending money to get more lives (or he's just really good at it and never dies!)\n\nIt sounds like he has an addiction to the game. These games are made to be as adictive as possible. As he is playing the game so much that it is causing problems in his life then it is having a negative effect.\n\nIt can be really hard to get someone to see that they have an addiction, esspecially when it's something like a little game. There is lots of advice out there about addictions and how to help someone. Hopefully as he's only been playing it for a few weeks it might not be too hard to give it up. Good luck", "NTA. Your husband is acting like a child over a game.", "He needs therapy ASAP before he wrecks his entire life which he is already in the process of. \n\nIt sounds like something else might be causing his sudden addiction, perhaps he\u2019s been depressed for awhile or going through something. He needs a professional to get him off this addiction fast.", "NTA. Sounds like a massive addiction, similar to gambling or shopping. Unfortunately, addicts blame orhers until the toll it takes becomes undeniable.", "NTA\n\nAs someone who games her fair share (but I don't have family responsibilities nor I let it take over my personal life), generally as long as I'm not negatively impacting anything or anyone, it's my business how much I choose to play.\n\nHowever, in your case, your husband's gaming addiction has obviously negatively impacted his own and your lives (yours and your son's, aka his family), in which case you absolutely has the right to address this with him.", "NTA, ultimatum time, he quits the game entirely or divorce", "NTA", "NTA Your husband needs a lesson in phone etiquette.  If it were me, I'd start with no phones at a family meal and make sure husband new it is a hill I'd die on.", "NTA, he\u2019s gonna blow up his entire life over a phone app. And what\u2019s it costing you? See if you can figure out what\u2019s he\u2019s spending on it because there\u2019s no way he\u2019s simply playing for free anymore. Get a copy of the phone bill.", "NTA   \n\n\nBut does your husband happen to be ADHD or possibly autistic? Neurodivergent people can often get hyper fixated on a novel thing and will be stuck doing it until the hyperfixation passes. A hyperfixation can last anywhere from a day to several months. The ND person can get very cranky when they are interrupted while in hyper fixation mode and it can interfere with basic needs of self care and work and life in general. i would suggest looking up the symptoms list for ADHD and autism spectrum and see if your husbands other traits fit into either of those. Like for adhd does he consume a lot of caffeine but seem to be completely unaffected by it, like he can have a cup and pass out asleep? Does he have food pickiness, textures, flavors, times of eating? Is he either extremely organized or extremely cluttered but has bouts of random organizing? Does he need high amounts of planned structure and routine, but in a way he hates It? Does he fidget with things, like something in his hands, change in his pockets, toes or feet tapping on the floor, bouncing his leg while sitting, or mindless munching on snacks while he watches something on tv? Is he or was he a nicotine consumer? As a kid was he described as being all over the place and difficult to handle (hyper activity) or was he very abhorrent to change and needed every step involved known and if he couldn\u2019t know or have time to adjust to the new circumstances did he have meltdowns?   \n\n\nThere\u2019s obviously a lot more symptoms for both but these are just some common things ND adults experience. If you find he fits on either scale of the spectrums you might want to suggest he sees someone for it, because it is not an easy way to live when you are unsupported. He needs to learn better communication skills and needs to have help with hyper fixating on something like a video game to the detriment of his social connections and family. Having temper tantrums when not getting his way is certainly a sign of emotional immaturity and he needs to work on that too.   \n\n\nAnd while you aren\u2019t the asshole here, if he is neurodiverent there are ways in you that you will have to change in terms of communicating with him. Just something to remember when you do a bit of research.", "NTA. He clearly has a game addiction!", "NTA.  He needs help.", "Your husband is lacking dopamine which is a medical problem that can be diagnosed and treated with meds. Get him to a doctor. If you explain it to him with concern and a medical thing, maybe he'll be more open about seeing a doctor. If he refuses, can you reach out to friends/family/etc to ask for help? Like the 50yo - can he say \"Dude let me take you to the doctor\"\n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nYour husband has an addiction. This is just a serious as an addiction to drugs or alcohol or gambling or anything else. \n\nHe needs help. If he refuses to get help, you may want to give some thought to the state of your marriage and whether you need to consider separating until he gets help. Because this will only get worse. If his work performance continues to be affected, they may end up firing him.", "Addicts can still be assholes", "I'm saying that OP is NTA", "Did he fall into a time warp to 2012?", "Addicted to Candy Crush?? What is this, 2014? Weird.", "NTA Honestly sounds like something else is going on. Videogame addiction can become a thing but usually it's rooted in something else underlying like depression or anxiety. Then those endorphins from games specifically made to be addicting (like Candy Crush) can become a problem.", "NTA- your husband is an addict.", "NTA start tracking his time playing candy crush over a week. But this is going to be hard to work thru because he is definitely addicted.", "Sure but NAH suggests the husband isn\u2019t being one.
