{"id": 26720, "submission_id": "16gsdn1", "title": "WIBTA if I moved away from my husband for a few days to prove a point?", "selftext": "UPDATE: I decided not to go to my family\u2019s house. But I did tell him that if he can\u2019t control his anger he needs to warn me the next time he feels he is about to blow up. And if he can\u2019t do that then we are either going to marriage counseling the next time this happens or are separating.\n\n\n\nWould it be bad if I (26F) moved out of the house away from my husband (28M) for a week?\n\nI guess I\u2019m trying to prove a point. I (26F) don\u2019t want to get divorced but I have honestly thought about it. My husband (28M) has rage problems. He frequently gets mad about stuff and then resembles a toddler that didn\u2019t get his way. He swears like a sailor, rampaging and talking to fast you can barely understand him between swear words. He will do this for a solid 10min. Then he has a terrible time accepting blame for his actions and tries to blame people around him. \n\nThis past weekend he was at a bachelor party. Before he left he was angry because he couldn\u2019t find a stray cat that got trapped in his garage. I told him don\u2019t worry about it. Have fun on your trip. I will get him out. I wasn\u2019t trying to promise I would get it out, rather that I would do my best. This cat is legit a ghost because I spent a ton of time this weekend with the door open, banging around in there, trying to lure the cat out and even setting 3 humane coon traps and I still couldn\u2019t prove the cat was officially gone. I told him when he got back because he was all worried about it- that I\u2019m pretty sure that cat may have snuck out when the door was open but idk. \n\nWell last night he found evidence of the cat in the still and blew off the handle, throwing a massive swearing fit and stomping his feet around. I said I know you are mad but you need to calm down. He said \u201cwell I\u2019m just mad because it\u2019s your fault you didn\u2019t get the cat out. I gave you one job and trusted you while I was gone and you couldn\u2019t even do that right. I\u2019m just gonna half ass when you ask for help now.\u201d\n\nI was appalled and said what did you expect me to do??? I did my best. Somewhere in our arguing he told me I couldn\u2019t do anything right because I forgot to do some stuff while he was gone. I told him I was busy and I was sorry but I didn\u2019t my best all the way around. But why is he so focused on what I didn\u2019t do and can\u2019t see what good I did do? I try to focus on the good and don\u2019t bring up if he forgets to do something. He said \u201coh please, even if I did everything right you still wouldn\u2019t do anything right.\u201d\n\nOuch\u2026.\n\nWell he said he was sorry only after I told him basically he needed to apologize. Then said he\u2019s not mad anymore and just wants to stop talking about it and just fix the problem. Part of me just wants to drop it. The other part of me wants to go spend a few days at one of my grandparents rent houses to see if he gets how serious I am. I\u2019m pretty good at forgiving, so I know I\u2019ll be over this later. But I\u2019m getting pretty resentful of this pattern of him hurting my feelings and then apologizing by going \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said that BUT do you see what you did wrong too?\u201d It doesn\u2019t feel like he actually gets it.\n\nI\u2019ve told him this and he just says I\u2019m trying to start fights that have ended. He doesn\u2019t listen.

He will use it as another lever of his abuse.\n\nI am sure there is a part of you that wants to fix this, because divorce is a big no no, and you \"love\" him.\n\nThe path to fixing this, is to confront him and demand that he get therapy AND an anger management program. Be clear: his behavior is unacceptable. It is abusive. You will no longer tolerate it. He does these things and gets better or you are out.\n\nIf he doesn't move on getting the therapy and anger management, within a week, you leave. Period. (Having scheduled something for first available appointment is acceptable.)\n\nIf he does, you give him 1 year (or less, but have a definite timeline in mind). If in that time the abuse hasn't ended, you leave.\n\nAs someone who tried to fix a similar situation, don't waste your time. You are better off just leaving now.", "NTA...You don't have to tolerate this behaviour. Do whatever you have to do.", "NTA. DO NOT DROP IT.

Tell him he gets to pick which way he wants to go because this has to stop. Hes awful!", "NTA. He is bullying you into submission, that is this behaviour. You need to go.\nIf it were up to me, i would say divorce him and do mot look back. Since you do not want that, I think a long seperation is in order, combined with couple therapy (or single therapy for him).

And if he doesn't, welcome into the rest of your life!", "NTA, but if this were me I'd be making it a permanent move. He's already verbally and emotionally abusive towards you, and doesn't seem to respect you at all. Then he thinks he's in the right for behaving the way he did. And it's only going to get worse the longer you stay around him. Honestly, I'm genuinely worried for your safety. \n\nAnd he wants to not talk about whatever the problem is anymore, but wants to fix them? How does that even work?

I think you might need to move out of the house for longer than a week so you can experience life without his behaviour. Like separation.

It's a very fine line between stomping around and slamming doors, to hurting the person who ticked him off. Like others said, pack up your stuff and get out.  Until he promises to attend anger management classes, and you both have counseling.  Until you feel safe again.", "NTA. I'd leave for a hell of a lot longer than a few days. I would insist he gets anger management help or I would divorce him. No one should live with someone who verbally attacks them like that. It's horrifying. This will NOT get better without a serious commitment on his behalf to bettering himself. Otherwise, - THIS IS WHAT THE REST OF YOUR ENTIRE LIFE WILL LOOK LIKE.", "NTA. Leave for a week and read the book **why does he do that**. It will answer a lot of your questions. \n\nYou do not deserve to be yelled at, you do not deserve to be told degrading things like \"you never do anything right.\" Im glad you understand this. \n\nBut you will not be able to fix his problem of angry outbursts. Only he can do that.

You don't want to get a divorce, but does he want to be married to you??

Not just for a week, but until he owns his behavior and maps out and implements how he is going to improve his mental health and be a better/safer spouse for you.", "NTA. Tell him to get therapy or you're out. This is not healthy. Do you really want to waste years of your life walking on eggshells around someone?

He didn\u2019t get as ragey as you describe your husband, but I was shocked at the contempt he had for others who had more than he did and it made him angry at the world and he couldn\u2019t take responsibility for anything. I paid off his 10k student loans debt that was 10 years old so he could be on the title of the house we were having built, and instead of saying thank you, he was angry because he was still trying to negotiate down the amount of the loan. I paid it off a week before it had to be handled. I left him one month before we were due to take possession of the house, and you better believe his entitlement extended to that houses too. He paid NOTHING toward the house I owned or the one we were buying, but felt he deserved 50% of the appreciated value of the new house (50k) because \u201che didn\u2019t let me take the lower offer\u201d on the house I was selling. His effort to save the marriage amounted to him taking me to one nice dinner, and when I still wanted a divorce he proceeded to try to get as much money as he could.  I found strength (and pettiness lol) I didn\u2019t know I had.  I told him if he didn\u2019t accept my settlement terms (a portion of the appreciated 50k but a far cry from half) I\u2019d refuse to sign and finalize the house and he\u2019d get zero. He looked into my eyes and knew I was not bluffing. He signed and I can honestly say I do not for one moment regret the marriage or the divorce because I learned vital things about myself and what I needed in a partner.
