Sometimes I have more than him and vice versa and that's fine. However, when it comes to coffee, he is a much bigger coffee drinker than me. I like the occasional coffee but I might only have one a week rather than one every day.\n\nI decided to buy some expensive coffee pods and knew that if I said that we went halves like we usually do, I would probably never get to drink them. So on this occasion I told him that I was going to buy the expensive coffee pods myself (so we were not going halves) but I didn't want him to drink them so that, when I did want a coffee, I could enjoy the coffee myself. I said that if he did want some, he needed to tell me and give me whatever I bought that pod for so it was fair. I explained that I couldn't afford to keep buying this particular coffee that I wanted at the rate I knew he could drink it.\n\nA few weeks later, I go to have my coffee and I find that he had drunk most of it without telling me. I confront him and an argument ensues where he tells me that the coffee was fair game because I wasn't drinking it quickly enough and he thought that I was being stupid by getting upset over it. He said that no normal person would take this long to drink coffee and that it's unreasonable for him to ask me every time he wants to use a coffee pod. I explained that if he wanted some he could buy it himself or we could go halves on some normal coffee but that the coffee pods we currently had, I had bought for me. He told me that he wasn't going to do that and that I should just get over it.\n\nSo AITA?\n\n[edit: Regarding \u201cgoing halves\u201d we essentially split the bills and groceries but we don\u2019t keep score on how much we have of things because it tends to equal itself out (coffee being an outlier in this regard). Groceries and bills are paid from a joint account which we pay equal amounts into. The coffee I bought was paid out of my own account as I intended it to be only for me. Other normal coffee is usually available for him which comes out of the shared budget.]", "created_utc": 1701963482, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18cy98q/aita_for_asking_my_boyfriend_to_not_drink_my/", "score": 19, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were pretty clear that you bought that coffee for your own use and why. Boyfriend should have replaced it if he was going to drink it. Best solution if he likes drinking that type of coffee more than what he usually buys is for you both just to start buying that type of coffee for the household. If you\u2019re not doing that because of cost, the he is doubly the AH for letting you spend the extra on it, then drinking it himself", "NTA - you are entitled to have your own food, drinks, snacks, treats etc and he should respect the fact you don\u2019t want to share that one particular thing. \n\nHowever , living together, doing life together, while going \u201chalves\u201d on everything from bills to coffee pods sounds exhausting", "NTA. You bought the coffee with your own money, and specifically asked him not the drink it. It\u2019s not really about the coffee, it\u2019s about the fact that he doesn\u2019t respect your request and is making you believe you\u2019re the asshole when he\u2019s the one who couldn\u2019t even honor a simple request", "NTA, you bought them for yourself, explicitly stated that they were just for you, and asked him to please not drink them.  He did it anyway.  That is incredibly frustrating.", "There seems to be an understanding that sometimes you have a little extra money and sometimes he does. \n\nThat said - you were clear that you bought the coffee for yourself and he was welcome to share it, if he replaced what he drank - which is sharing with the understandable contingency.\n\nHe agreed to this - so it makes him look selfish and disrespectful by arguing that he doesn\u2019t think you drank it quickly enough?! He needs to replace it and drink what he can afford if replacing it is out of his budget. NTA", "Anyone saying she\u2019s the asshole is being very extra. Theres no obligation to share everything with a partner. Yes you don\u2019t want to be labelling every single thing in the fridge but also you\u2019re allowed to buy nice things and want them for yourself. \n\nI used to do the same with toiletries, we\u2019d share everything in the bathroom but sometimes I\u2019d treat myself to expensive shower gel / shampoo etc so I\u2019d ask my boyfriend if he would mind not using it and he\u2019d be fine with that becaus eit was mine?", "NTA. You bought them for yourself and you've stated that you want to have them. You're allowed to want to have things for just *you*. I'd be frustrated as well.", " NTA.  It\u2019s the not drinking it quickly enough comment that got me. It\u2019s not a contest, should not be survival of the fastest.", "NTA, you got yourself a little treat and asked him not to take it. I would be upset too and its not stupid. \n\nIf he were under 10 and it was juice then I'd be like 'Well what did you think would happen?' but a grown up should be able to say 'No I love my partner and I want them to get their little treat, I'll have the normal coffee to chug today'", "NTA, most definitely. \n\nI love snacks, but I don't have the need to eat it immediately. I'll often just put it in my cupboard and leave it there until I eat it. When we, as a family of four, buy snacks everyone get to eat theirs at their leisure. I get asked when I'll be eating mine because it's bothering them. I tell them it's a them problem, not a me problem. Your bf has a \"him\" problem and needs to learn to leave your coffee alone.

Something like San Fransisco Bay brand French Roast goes for about $19 on Amazon. ***It's 2 lbs of good coffee.***\n\nThere's no reason to be buying pods.

You asked him not to use something that you purchased for yourself and although he agreed at the time he did not have enough respect to keep his word. \n\nGoing forward, if he is unable to respect you in regard to the little things, then I would be very wary that he would steamroller over you for the bigger things.\n\nI would be having a serious discussion with him, but in the meantime, if you buy yourself expensive coffee pods again, I would transfer them to a Tampax box and hide them in the bathroom cabinet.", "NTA. But in the future hide it.", "NTA, because it's one specific treat you bought for yourself to enjoy alone and he had most of it. (I have a sibling who does this all the time it's so upsetting).\n\nBut also i think that feeling should be unrelated to how you're handling your finances. Overthinking finances so much is very exhausting in a partnership, going halfsies on everything. You should think of a more sustainable way to decide things. Cover for him when he's short and let him cover for you when you are. Keeping a running tab is not going to work long term. You two are one unit, not separate people simply sharing a living space out of convenience. And bringing finances into arguments like this will eventually create a lot of bitterness.\n\nAs conflict resolution tell him to buy his own pack, or buy you a new one. Or tell him to take over coffee expenses and you'll take over something else. Feelings over finances complicate a lot of very simple things.", "If this is the worries of your life.... I wish life was this easy", "You\u2019re partners, not roommates. I think setting a limit on how much coffee (or any grocery items) someone can have is unreasonable in a relationship.

Please don't use any, so that I know when I am running out because I am the only one using this stash.\"\n\nBut man, if you're going to act like this with such relatively-small expenses, what a miserable relationship you two will have. Do you buy all your own personal care products or do you share them, and are you sure you don't use more of that than he does or that you don't pick a more expensive brand for yourself? What about heating in the house, maybe he's happy for it to be 16 C but you want it to be 19 C so you put the heating up for that, perhaps he can ask you for that price difference as that will be quite a lot of $$$ in colder months. What about TV, do you watch it more by yourself than he does, using more power and wearing the TV down faster? What about laundry detergent, do you wash your clothes more frequently than he does?

The coffee pods can be bought as caramel latte, holiday special flavours, etc. Starbucks at home tbh. \nAnd unless you buy the strong brew pods.
