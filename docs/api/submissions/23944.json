Best of luck <3", "Your mom was gaining a confidence boost by putting you down, even though it was giving you eating disorder habits. Screw her. You are awesome. Workout if it makes you happy.", "NTA. Send them some articles about how parents create eating disorders in children (and you are technically a child!). They need to see that what they are doing is not parental concern or guidance but emotionally and psychologically dangerous especially  in today's society.\n\nMany foreign cultures (I come  from one) have a different mind set. Parents nag and you are supposed to obey. We have a strange relationship with food. It is perfectly okay for grandmoms, mothers, aunts,  everyone to both stuff your mouth and be completely offended if you don't eat second helpings;  but also scold you for being 5 pounds over what is healthy in that culture.( You can't be 4 pounds less than that either. Then you are unhealthy and look like you are dying.)\n\n Our mothers grew up like this and it was toxic . But there was no internet, no constant influx of body shaming, no easy tips on the internet on how to purge,  so while that toxicity did harm, it did not as egregiously as it does with women that grew up after the 90s. Not as bad as girls today living in the world of Instagram and cyberbullying.\n\nYour family should be your place of safety. Not the place where you are being bullied. \n\nNow, if you are a non Westerner, esp Hispanic, Asian, African, let's face it. They are always going to nag you about studies, grand kids, men etc...depending upon culture...those things we can't help. But health and emotional wellness, that culture can't afford to get in the way.\n\nIn addition to articles, look for YouTube clips, or stories from psychologists that work with recovering teens with ED. Especially those with parental influence. In countries like US, Mexico, a. Korea and Brazil, kids as young as 9 want to go on diets because of casual comments by family members about their chubbiness, \"puppy fat\" etc. I am hoping this will help your parents stop seeing this as a typical teen confrontation. Then once your mother can acknowledge why it was wrong and fix her behavior, you can apologize for your tone if you think you need to.\n\nGood luck and well done for standing up for yourself.", "NTA.

Also, don't listen to someone who talks the talk but doesn't walk the walk.", "NTA  \n\n\nMatters of respect are not something inherent to anyone, be they higher on the hierarchy of family or status or what. It sounds as if there's some bizarre insecurities with your mother that she needs to address for herself if she's constantly feeling the need to compare to her daughter and to say those things.   \n\n\nIt can be difficult to speak up for yourself when you're younger, but they are going to have to realize that you're coming to the point of development as an adult. And they're going to have to respect that you're not going to stand being a teased child any longer.   \n\n\nSomewhat unrelated but I am concerned for anyone that doesn't get at least three meals a day. Not eating enough food can affect your moods and development for sure. I would advise to be more wary about only eating once or twice a day, but ultimately you're growing to make your own decisions for yourself.   \n\n\nI hope you are able to reconcile with your family about the instance. Maybe you and your mom could look into doing those youtube workouts together to bond? At any rate, I hope things work out for you!", "NTA. All you\u2019ve done is started to reflect her comments back at her. If it\u2019s rude for you to say them, it\u2019s rude for her as well.

It is saying that you feel sad that she is sad. You can go that far without backing down.)\n\n\"Remember a while back when you got worried that I was eating so little? I need you to understand that I was developing an eating disorder, and the reason for that was because of the way you have always talked to me about food and my weight. The only way I can have a healthy relationship with food is to ignore everything you keep saying to me, but you are not making that easy.
