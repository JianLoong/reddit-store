Parents aren't always right, they're just as flawed as the rest of us.  It is unfair of your family to request this of you, the reality is don't dish it if you can't take it.", "NTA. My sister went through the same thing growing up. Your mom was likely just projecting and couldn\u2019t take the taste of her own medicine", "NTA. Your mom is TA for making comments about your weight and your eating habits. And your dad is wrong. You do not have to show your mom respect about this because she hasn't shown you any. \n\nIt sounds like you actually should both go to therapy together because there are some unhealthy attitudes towards food and weight in your household.", "NTA. She is completely projecting her internalized fat phobia onto you. Like it\u2019s some therapy for herself and you 1000% don\u2019t deserve to go along with that. She\u2019s mad you called her out and now she knows she can\u2019t bully you anymore to make herself feel better. Gtfo of there, and go no contact with your family if you\u2019re able to and make a new family around people that build you up and not tear you down. Best of luck <3", "Your mom was gaining a confidence boost by putting you down, even though it was giving you eating disorder habits. Screw her. You are awesome. Workout if it makes you happy.", "NTA. Send them some articles about how parents create eating disorders in children (and you are technically a child!). They need to see that what they are doing is not parental concern or guidance but emotionally and psychologically dangerous especially  in today's society.\n\nMany foreign cultures (I come  from one) have a different mind set. Parents nag and you are supposed to obey. We have a strange relationship with food. It is perfectly okay for grandmoms, mothers, aunts,  everyone to both stuff your mouth and be completely offended if you don't eat second helpings;  but also scold you for being 5 pounds over what is healthy in that culture.( You can't be 4 pounds less than that either. Then you are unhealthy and look like you are dying.)\n\n Our mothers grew up like this and it was toxic . But there was no internet, no constant influx of body shaming, no easy tips on the internet on how to purge,  so while that toxicity did harm, it did not as egregiously as it does with women that grew up after the 90s. Not as bad as girls today living in the world of Instagram and cyberbullying.\n\nYour family should be your place of safety. Not the place where you are being bullied. \n\nNow, if you are a non Westerner, esp Hispanic, Asian, African, let's face it. They are always going to nag you about studies, grand kids, men etc...depending upon culture...those things we can't help. But health and emotional wellness, that culture can't afford to get in the way.\n\nIn addition to articles, look for YouTube clips, or stories from psychologists that work with recovering teens with ED. Especially those with parental influence. In countries like US, Mexico, a. Korea and Brazil, kids as young as 9 want to go on diets because of casual comments by family members about their chubbiness, \"puppy fat\" etc. I am hoping this will help your parents stop seeing this as a typical teen confrontation. Then once your mother can acknowledge why it was wrong and fix her behavior, you can apologize for your tone if you think you need to.\n\nGood luck and well done for standing up for yourself.", "NTA. Don't apologise, you have no reason to. Also, don't listen to someone who talks the talk but doesn't walk the walk.", "NTA  \n\n\nMatters of respect are not something inherent to anyone, be they higher on the hierarchy of family or status or what. It sounds as if there's some bizarre insecurities with your mother that she needs to address for herself if she's constantly feeling the need to compare to her daughter and to say those things.   \n\n\nIt can be difficult to speak up for yourself when you're younger, but they are going to have to realize that you're coming to the point of development as an adult. And they're going to have to respect that you're not going to stand being a teased child any longer.   \n\n\nSomewhat unrelated but I am concerned for anyone that doesn't get at least three meals a day. Not eating enough food can affect your moods and development for sure. I would advise to be more wary about only eating once or twice a day, but ultimately you're growing to make your own decisions for yourself.   \n\n\nI hope you are able to reconcile with your family about the instance. Maybe you and your mom could look into doing those youtube workouts together to bond? At any rate, I hope things work out for you!", "NTA. All you\u2019ve done is started to reflect her comments back at her. If it\u2019s rude for you to say them, it\u2019s rude for her as well. Having said that, the things we hate about ourselves are the things we pick at in other people- your mum hates her own thighs so she comments endlessly about yours. Doesn\u2019t make her right tho. Do I dare ask if you\u2019re from a culture where elders are to be respected no matter what their behaviour? That\u2019ll make it harder on you and I\u2019m sorry that I can\u2019t suggest a better way to handle it", "You might try this.\n\n\"Mom, I'm sorry that what I said hurt your feelings.\" \n\n(Note, that is NOT apologizing for what you said. It is saying that you feel sad that she is sad. You can go that far without backing down.)\n\n\"Remember a while back when you got worried that I was eating so little? I need you to understand that I was developing an eating disorder, and the reason for that was because of the way you have always talked to me about food and my weight. The only way I can have a healthy relationship with food is to ignore everything you keep saying to me, but you are not making that easy. If you don't want me to end up with anorexia, can we please have an agreement that neither of us will talk to the other about our weight or how we eat?\"", "NTA.\n'I'm sorry you can dish out, but can't take it'", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I can't blame you for losing your temper and talking back after putting up with years of non-stop verbal abuse.\n\nIt might have been more effective to tell her how you feel about her insults, instead of criticizing her weight and size. Saying what you did put her on the defensive, and she retaliated by pulling the \"respect your mother\" card instead of listening to your complaints. Now she, your dad and relatives are all on their high horses saying that you're disrespectful to your mother. What they are doing is bullying and disrespecting your legitimate concerns. \n\nI suspect your mother knows very well that she has an eating and weight problem, but instead of facing it, she's projecting her inner issues onto you.\n\nAre you seeing a therapist, or can you ask to go to one? It sounds like your mother's verbal abuse has pushed you to the verge of having an ED. Therapy may show you ways to tune her out and manage your heealth effectively. \n\nThe therapist  can show you how to form I-messages, which are better ways to voice complaints to another person. For example, \"I feel so hurt when I get criticized about my body.\" \"I'm feeling worried that I could be getting an eating disorder, and I need help to deal with this.\" What you're doing with I-messages is voicing your concerns without putting the person hearing you on the defensive.\n\nMaybe you can play the \"I'm shocked at what I said to Mom and I want therapy to help me not do it again\" card in order to get the therapy for what you really need.\n\nGood luck!", "NTA!
