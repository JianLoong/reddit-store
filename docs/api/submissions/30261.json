Victor is gay and has been dating \"Liam\"(M25) for about 2 years seriously. During pride event, Liam had jokingly gave me a condom and said \"Would you want to?\" since it said it on the package in front of Victor (I guess the bit was that I was going to bang him). \n\nI had talked to Victor about this a while ago and expressed how I felt a bit uncomfortable with the joke and Victor had talked to Liam about it. This leads to what happened a couple of weeks ago. I recently got a cat and posted a photo of her  to our Discord full of highschool friends including Victor & Liam saying \"Guys I am a mother\". Liam then called me \"hi mommy\" and everytime I call Victor to chat I sometimes here Liam in the background saying \"Mommmy!\" or\"Hi mommy!\" I want to talk to Victor about this and ask him to talk to Liam again about calling me \"Mommy\" since it does make me a bit uncomfortable. \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
