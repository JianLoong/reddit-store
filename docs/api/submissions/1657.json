So, I chose not to donate it.\n\nWhen I posted the video of me shaving it my SIL commented that it looked good but I should've done it in a way that would've allowed me to donate it. I ignored the comment. \n\nBut she then brought it up during a family gathering. We were talking one-on-one and she asked why I didn't donate. I was honest with her and told her why. She said it was a horrible thing to do and that wanting a cool video was a silly reason not to donate.\n\nShe was clearly upset about and the rest of the family heard about this issue. Everyone thinks I was an asshole not to donate it because it is such a sensitive topic for my SIL because her wife is a cancer survivor. \n\nThey think that because she did bring it up to me before I shaved it, I didn't have an excuse not to donate it. I get that donating it would've been a great thing to do but I don't think doing the opposite makes me an asshole. \n\nSo, am I really an asshole for not donating my hair?\n\nEdit: Don't know if it makes much of a difference, but I have to explain that the video was mainly for me only.

I can't believe how few people are giving any thoughtful consideration to OP's motivations here. Drastic changes to appearance, hair in particular, often arise from some sort of emotional upheaval that the person is going through. A need to reestablish identity, let go of something, regain control of their own existence. How many of us have suddenly felt the need to dye it purple or cut bangs after a bad breakup? There is some emotional processing that happens in the act of exerting control over one's appearance, especially in a way that subverts societal norms. It's not necessarily something that people are aware of or willing to articulate to others when they're in the middle of that type of emotional processing. \n\nDespite the fact it wasn't specifically explained as being part of the motivation in this post, I get a strong impression that there is an emotional struggle at play when someone goes from long hair to entirely shaved head. Everyone's here acting like it's no skin off her back whatsoever to donate it, saying it's selfish not to donate, but that's not an accurate or fair assessment. It was her hair and her *experience* and there is nothing selfish in keeping control of that experience for herself.

I cannot fathom the time I spent to research and mail the hair being deemed more valuable than helping a child feel good while potentially battling for their life.\n\nBut OP has the right to say no, so NTA, based on that alone. No is a full sentence, but the need for a video and lack of time to research is meh, personally.", "Or, SIL could have just donated her own hair.", "I\u2019ve donated my hair at least 10 times now (been donating every haircut for 25 years. I only cut every couple years, I have thick hair that grows fast). It\u2019s not a lot of trouble.

Since the sister cares so much about OP taking all the steps to donate her hair I\u2019d like to know how often her sister does it. OP has good reasons like maybe it won\u2019t go to a good cause but instead a wig factory or something similar so if OP\u2019s sister cares so much she could of easily referred OP to her sources and where she donates her hair, yet seems like the sister doesn\u2019t even donate her own hair enough to have a sources for her sister to donate to. Definitely think sister is just trying to play the moral high card to make herself look good for her wife or the rest of the family but id love to know since she cares so much and must also be an avid donor why she didn\u2019t help OP find an easy trustworthy place to donate to.

You can then cut whatever is left at a salon or of shaving your head do that for the video.\n\nOP is selfish and prioritized laziness over relationship with SIL.

NAH - the SIL is allowed to feel disappointed in OP", "I've donated 5 times and the only reason I'm not doing it now is due to the amount of grey. How it is hard??  You do 10 mins of research to find one that fits the length you want to cut. The stylist ties the hair multiple times with rubber bands. She cuts it off, hands it to you. Then she styles your hair. You place the hair in a bubble mailer and send it in. \n\nI'm not saying you have to donate. It is your hair. But it isn't difficult. If you don't like the rules of one organization there are others.", "When my kids were little, we went to a children's haircut salon that donated the hair, with permission, to an organization that used the hair to soak up oil spills.

As you said, you wouldn\u2019t shame someone for not donating to charity, so why is this different?\n\nIt\u2019s hers, and her reasons for not donating are her own (e.g. some people are simply uncomfortable with the idea of donating it, and that\u2019s completely fine!) When she decided against it, SIL should\u2019ve dropped it. \n\nSecondly, she\u2019s right; many of the organisations and so-called charities that you can donate hair to are NOT reputable, and will actually take people\u2019s hair and sell it. Many that I approached for wigs asked me for payment in return, and they were low quality. I, like many individuals with medically induced alopecia, got sick of it and ended up purchasing our own wig out of pocket.\n\nOP realised that many were disreputable, and didn\u2019t wish to put in a great deal of effort, only to find she contributed to an organisation that scams cancer patients. That\u2019s totally fair.\n\nThirdly, I know a couple of people who did donate their hair, but then stopped as it was a huge hassle.

When I was in my 20s I could grow 18+ inches of hair in a year, and a free haircut fit my budget beautifully. Until one year when they cut my hair too short and uneven. The stylist tried to tell me it looked \u201csassy\u201d but half of it was too short for even pigtails. I stopped donating after that.", "What this means is that you have been told several times that it was donated. And it\u2019s possible it was.

Most give you the hair to send in yourself.", "Op did research and couldn\u2019t find any reliable places to donate to.

When I first started (8th grade) I went somewhere that donated it themselves but after that I've had to donate it myself. I just explain to my stylist how they need to do it with the braids and then I take it in a ziplock bag home with me and mail it in. Ive had some confused stylists before and some who may not do it in the sort of \"most ideal\" kind of way (like they've just done 1 big braid instead of multiple smaller braids, which ends up losing some longer hair on the sides, if that makes sense) but those are the kind of things I've learned the more I've done it and aren't the end of the world for newer people who are still learning (id guess I've donated about 5 times as well)", "I\u2019m puzzled as well. Of course no one has to donate their hair (I\u2019ve been dyeing mine lately instead of prioritizing donating it), but you normally just stick it in a bag and mail it. In the past I always donated to Pantene and now I\u2019m wondering if other organizations have more complicated requirements.", "I can't remember the low down exactly on locks of love, seem to recall they've done some problematic things though. \n\nHowever, a lot of charities that accept hair do sell the hair - they sell to wig makers, and then use those profits to buy wigs from them at a reduced cost. Wig making isn't exactly a simple process, and it would be incredibly uneconomical for most charities to set up their own factory.", "When my niece lost her hair due to a tumor, we tried Lock of Love, and they wanted a deposit, then someone would come try styles, and the deposit would be applied to the cost of the wig, which we would have hhad to pay for.\n\nWigs for Kids, operates on donations only,  we donated hair and money, and she got a beautiful wig, we donated it back when she passed, Hopefully it went to another little girl", "This!

It's \"I don't want to donate, I want to do something for myself\". She says it wasn't for social media but for herself. And my sister had cancer, we discussed donating my hair at one point and the rules can be very strict so there's no guarantee her hair would even be used. Frankly while donating is fantastic, it's not something that makes you an asshole for not doing. \n\nOP wanted to do a video for herself. If OP wanted to dye her hair a crazy color before shaving it off (effectively ruining the hair for donation) would she also be an asshole? I don't want to donate instead I want to flash fry my hair and do crazy colors for fun. You could spin it in a way that sounds bad absolutely. But at the core of it, OP should be allowed to not donate without shame. I'm all for donation. But not doing so, or doing something that makes it so you cant isn't inherently wrong. \n\nThe only scenario I could see OP as an AH is if OP did so out of spite to ruin a donation. Like saying \"I hated the idea of donating so much I ruined my hair so they specifically couldn't.\" That's a lot of extra steps to be petty. But she didn't. She just wanted to do a video for herself. I took pictures when I shaved my head. Not for social media but to see the back of my head as I lost my hair. So I guess I'm biased, but I get the feeling OP had about it. It wasn't for clout it was for myself. OP didn't do it specifically to ruin a donation.
