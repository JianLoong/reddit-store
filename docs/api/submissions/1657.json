I still think there\u2019s more work to be done in terms of determining who is reputable. Why didn\u2019t SIL say \u201cthis is the reputable personal who is accepting the hair, if isn\u2019t gonna be a wig for so and so down the block or around the way, this is their contact, and I\u2019m willing to help.\u201d  Instead she\u2019s just tossing out marching orders.", "I thought I posted this on my throwaway but it doesn't make much of a difference really. Thanks for letting me know though!", "It means \"untouched\". Or, like with olive oil \"unprocessed\" .. EVOO being just the first pressing and nothing added to the oil.  \n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive\\_oil#:\\~:text=The%20word%20%22virgin%22%20indicates%20that,been%20linked%20with%20better%20health.", "I am OP using a throwaway which I intended to use when posting my issue. I'm replying to comments with this one because I might delete the post on my main account eventually, but this way, the comments will be here if anyone comes across this post later.", "Thanks. I think we all do things that are selfish and maybe even silly instead of helping someone in need. We do it all the time and we aren't called asshole for it, which is why my family's reaction is strange to me. The petty in me wants to go to each and every one of them and say things like why don't you donate money to cancer charity instead of your expensive car or clothes or meals?", "To quote OP\n\n\n>Edit: Don't know if it makes much of a difference, but I have to explain that the video was mainly for me only. It wasn't for \"clout\" or \"shocking\" people. I only posted it on my private account after most people saw or knew about my shaved head and some asked me to share the video.", "Oh no, not attention! Someone call the police!", "What if I wanted to make an art work or sentimental object with those clothes? Would it be okay? Because that's how I kinda view the video i took. I wanted to see my reactions to shaving it. I wanted to see the hair that mattered too much to me fall. I wanted it on video for me and I ended up sharing with people I love.", "I agree, I\u2019m just saying those arguments are stronger than what kind of hair she had, since it sounds like she would meet the requirements.", "Oh, FFS, don't go deleting shit.\n\nAnyone reading will still know who originally posted this, /u/Spirazura", "1000%. I take back what I said originally, once again was mostly if it were for clout. More so annoying than asshole. Everyone could do more, so it\u2019s a never ending spiral. If it were me I would try to be the bigger person for now but if it continues, say something along those lines but in a calm tone and different words of course.", "You\u2019re right.", "I can delete what I want after the vote. There is always a copy of what I said. You are weird btw.", "Also, I didn\u2019t know hair needed to be braided up to be donated but it definitely makes sense. Thank you for teaching me something new today!"]}
