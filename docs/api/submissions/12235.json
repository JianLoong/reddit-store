I want to point out, I *didn't* know them prior to moving in, I found out when touring the house. We made friends while living together, but I wasn't asking any friend to let me stay at their family house.\n\nSo I simply looked for an affordable house near my college and moved in. Their family isn't well off, but they had this house in the city they have always been renting out to students with 2 rooms and 4 beds. When the eldest started college, she kept renting the remaining spots and, of course, they're still renting a bed. So I am just dealing with regular rent as a regular tenant, because they want at least my rent to make ends meet (fair enough). I pay as much as the girls renting before me did (so 1/4 of their previous total income), pay 1/4 of the utilities, make my own groceries runs. All in all, regular renting life economic wise.\n\nProblems started when their parents decided to come over and stay a week. The sisters asked me if it bothered me if guests slept in the living room or if they should rearrange the twins' bedroom to fit 4 people, I said I didn't mind but the twins ended up giving up their room and the parents got the beds. Fine with me. But then they started to demand I had dinner earlier/later to let them have dinner \"as a family\". I said I didn't mind eating by myself in the kitchen instead of the dining room, but I wanted to eat when I wanted because I have class until late and then I want to study after dinner. They said it was annoying because I would be lurking in the background (kitchen, living/ dining rooms have no doors) but also dining in my bedroom would be bad, because I would be cooking while they're trying to enjoy their time as a family and come in to wash my dishes or *worse*, leave them dirty in the sink.\nThe next day they brought up my \"hanging around\" too much in the kitchen (no doors) while the twins wanted to sleep (I was making myself coffee to stay up and they didn't have a problem with me waking them up, they were still up, but with \"walking in their new bedroom is creepy\") and how I was spending all time off class at home (my room) instead of studying in the library at uni. \n\nI don't think those are fair requests because I also have to live in this house, I don't care if they're related and want to spend time as a family without me. I'm not imposing myself on them but I was wondering if I should just stay out of the house as much as possible out of respect, like having dinner at the school cafeteria or studying in the library. I don't like my university too much, so I'd rather just stay home. So AITA? It's been three days already and this is wearing me down.\n\nalso sorry for the bad English.\n\nEDIT: because I don't think it was clear. The house is their family's. I assume parent's or uncle's because it was to be their grandparents' house before they passed.
