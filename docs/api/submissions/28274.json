I 42 work from my home office. We have two children 2/4. \n\nWe had a nanny, Esme, whom we hired after we moved to this city for my wife's job. We do not have family in this city. \n\nEsme was with us since we got here six months ago. She was excellent at her job and she was a pleasant person in general. \n\nDanielle got it into her head that Esme was going to try and get me away from her. She fired her. It was a ridiculous assertion. I love my wife. But she insisted. She then proceeded to kibosh any nanny that the agencies sent. Even the male one because she thought it was \"weird\" to have a male nanny. \n\nShe wants me to watch the kids since I'm home anyway. I said that there was no way that was happening. I bring home 65% of our income. I cannot watch the kids and work. I have dealt with this temporarily by inviting my parents to stay with us so they can watch the kids.  \n\nDanielle hates this. She likes my folks but she doesn't like having them here 100% of the time. However neither her mom or dad are able to help. \n\nI told her that if she wants my parents to go home she either has to replace our nanny or she has to stay home to watch the kids.\n\nShe says that I'm an asshole for devaluing her work and expecting her to watch the kids because she's the woman.

She fired Esme over her own insecurities, then disagrees with having your parents over for so long and then thinks that working from home means you're basically free to look after the kids as well.\n\nShe is devaluing your work by expecting you to watch the kids whilst WFH. Even if you didn't bring in the majority of the household income, her stance is insulting to you.", "NTA. She is absurd, she created the situation. It's fine if she doesn't want to stay at home, but she can't expect you to somehow both work and parent two children at the same time, because she doesn't like either your parents or any nanny", "NTA. Your wife must be joking using terms like \u201cdevaluing\u201d when she is the one devaluing you, devaluing a professional nanny who just so happens to be female and then utterly dismissing a male nanny based upon his sex. She needs to get it together. Does this self centered thinking affect other aspects of your marriage, as well? She sounds like she lacks any type of self awareness.", "\u201cShe says that I'm an asshole for devaluing her work and expecting her to watch the kids\u2026.\u201d\nI\u2019m confused, isn\u2019t this exactly what she\u2019s doing to you?

The Iranian yogurt is not the issue here.\n\nTherapy? A vacation? I don\u2019t know but if you don\u2019t start making decisions as a team and she doesn\u2019t figure out what\u2019s making her so insecure that she can\u2019t have a nanny (male or female) then this will only get worse. \n\nDid she cheat? Did you? Is there a reason for this? If not, this is probably a pattern of behavior and you need to get to the root of it together.", "NTA\n\nThe fact that she not only had issues with Esme but also every other nanny provided as an option? Serious question - is this the marriage you want to be in?  I know people on Reddit jump quickly to divorce, but this level of jealousy/insecurity isn\u2019t healthy.  I\u2019d look into counseling, both marriage and individual.", "NTA. She did create that situation. It's up to her to fix it.", "  Nta - insecure and jealous. It\u2019s not your fault. She stirred the pot she can fix it.", "NTA, she got herself into this situation by being jealous, and her solution is for you to watch two little kids while trying to juggle work at the same time? That's ridiculous and impossible. If anything, she's being the AH by creating this situation and then expecting you do your job plus a nanny's job. You tried several different solutions and she didn't like them.  I find it funny that she can't seem to grasp that you dividing your attention between kids and work is just a disaster waiting to happen? Has she parented a day in her life? This baffles me. Being a nanny to two small children is a full time job, and I am assuming yours is also a full time job. Tell her that what she is expecting is not reasonable, end of discussion. Tell her it's her issue now and you are washing your hands of it. See how quickly she will either let the IL's stay and hires a new nanny.", "NTA\n\nBut there is a 3rd option. \n\nTell her you will watch the kids starting next month BUT in order to do this you will quit your job so she has time till end of the month to show you a plan how she will raise her income significantly by end of the month or how your household budget is going to work with only her salary and not reducing your available fun money by more than 10%.", "Have either of you ever cheated, or were either of you already in a relationship when you got together?

She expects you to work & be the nanny at the same time because of her insecurities.", "NTA. \n\nIs there any way you can go into work for awhile? Or do your work from a different place like a cafe or library? It seems like she doesn\u2019t value what you are doing just because you are at home.", "NTA - Her behavior is going to be what causes a divorce, not a nanny", "Definitely NTA. As a nanny, working for work from home parents can be hard already. Then you slap on top of that a mom who thinks you're trying to bang her husband? Nope, just nope. Depending on where you are, there is probably a strong nanny community, and others have been warned about your wife. I really hope you gave a good severance and recommendation for your last nanny. Maybe look into daycare/preschool cause your wife is probably going to scare off any nanny you are able to hire and is unwilling to take responsibility for her insecurities and actions.", "NTA.  \n\nShe is sabotaging your job, along with your ability to work outside the home.  I think you need to have a serious conversation about what both of you need and expect.\n\nI would tell her she has a short list of options:\n- she allows you to rehire a nanny\n- she lives with your parents as childcare\n- she gets a job that makes up for your financial contribution to the household if she wants you to stay home\n- she stays home, and adjusts her lifestyle to make up for the loss of her income\n- she moves out and lives a lifestyle she can afford by herself\n\nIt isn't just about her insecurity with the nanny.  It's about how little she values a job that lets you work from home, and how little she values the work involved in childcare.", "NTA and how do people think that working from home means a person isn't working. Kids need attention. Does OPs wife expect him to ignore the kids? She needs to deal with her discomfort and figure this out.", "NTA\n\nYour wife is undervaluing YOUR work because you WFH.

Stick to your guns.", "NTA. Your wife is acting very insecure around both female and male nannies. I wonder what is troubling her beside feeling that they are going to pounce on you. This needs discussing with perhaps a third party like a therapist. You are unfortunately in a no win situation.", "NTA. I am sick and tired of people that think because we work from home full-time we have time to do whatever the hell we want whenever we want. You have to do your job. You do not have time to look after a two and a four-year-old. Two and four year olds need a lot of looking after and when you don\u2019t hear them doing anything that\u2019s when you need to worry because they\u2019re doing something they shouldn\u2019t be doing. Your wife either needs to get over herself and hire another nanny or she needs to quit and take care of the kids. Or she needs to pay to send them to daycare.", "NTA. You're spot on.

We don\u2019t want your husband. We want a consistent, quality paycheck and employment. And how offensive to you! She thinks so lowly of you that she can\u2019t trust you alone at home while your child is there? \n\nBoth of my bosses work from home. there is no way that they would be able to watch their children, handle, pick ups, handle meal times, change diapers, and create learning opportunities while also trying to work a full-time job. If she keeps doing this, the nanny agency might even blacklist you as employers. I mean, why waste the time and resources? \n\nNTA and if she can\u2019t come up with a solution then she can deal with your parents.", "NTA.  And the fact that your wife is playing the \"woman\" card on these facts is reprehensible.", "Danielle is manipulating the situation to allow her to quit her job while blaming others (sexy nanny,stubborn husband, annoying in-laws) and get to be the martyr who has to give up her career.

Are there any reasons for your wife to be jealous/past instances of cheating or insecurities?\n\nNTA for the time being, but if you have an otherwise loving relationship, I would investigate this further and see if your wife needs some counseling. Obviously, she created this situation and needs to be part of the solution. But, part of that is overcoming her insecurities and taking responsibility for them.\n\nAlso, it's impossible to watch two little ones while working from home. I've tried. LOL  \n\n\nGood luck.", "NTA for the nanny thing, but you guys need couples counseling because that level of distrust and jealousy is not sustainable.", "\\> I think she created this situation and it's her responsibility to deal with it.\n\nNTA for exactly this.

She fired the nanny, refused any replacements, refuses to accept that WFH is actual work and you can\u2019t take care of two young children, refuses daycare, and is rejecting your parents as live-in caregivers?\n\nYes, she can either suck it up and help pay for a new nanny or daycare OR she can stay home with the kids instead of volun-telling you that your job is irrelevant and you need to bow down to her irrational demands.\n\nIs this the only instance of utterly irrational behaviour? If not, seek marriage counselling soon.", "NTA.\n\nPut the children in daycare. Hire a new nanny yourself. Nanny share with another family at their house. \n\nThere are options. Use them. You can't work at home and watch children. It does not work.", "NTA - but if you have the resources then you might consider therapy for yourself. \n\nYour wife\u2019s behaviour sounds very unbalanced, and moving you away from your family, then trying to stop you from earning your own income isn\u2019t a great look on her. \n\nIf the genders were reversed, a lot of people would be saying: research the factors for abuse, and look for red flags. \n\nBecause removing you from your friends & family (and being annoyed when they visit, because that\u2019s failed!), then trying to sabotage your ability to earn an independent income are classic signs of abuse in a relationship.  \n\nEven if it\u2019s \u201cjust\u201d that she\u2019s stressed by the new job on top of a move, her behaviour is irrational and a good therapist will be able to help you to help her - rather than doing the wrong thing & escalating the problem.", "You have marital problems beyond who is watching the kids.

Did I miss something that would leave you to believe the OP is insane and belligerent?", "Just parent. OP seems okay. The wife however is nuts", "Parent not parents. The only belligerent one I see here is the wife.", "I just got mine into a preschool, with no wait, but she\u2019s 2 and a half now and we\u2019ve been on the waitlist for the daycare/preschool we actually wanted since my wife was about 4 months pregnant. It\u2019s insane how competitive the good ones can be.", "When my son was an infant he went to a daycare owned and run by a man. There was a waiting list, and his employees were wonderful. This was over 30 years ago, and I wonder if he'd even be able to do this in today's times.", "It's so fucked up that we don't think of men as kind and nurturing, when obviously that potential lives in either gender. I, for example, have always had the nurturing spirit of a granite boulder, whereas the boy I crushed on in high school always wanted to be a dad and is a wonderful father now.", ">No kidding.    My friend brought his kid with to go fishing and handed me the kid so he could grab his gear.   I was like \"when was the last time someone handed me a child?\"  The answer is never.", "Yes, which is why it's funny that she's playing the misogyny card. She's also hypocritical about devaluing her work since she expects him to work and watch the kids. She really can't think critically", "It sounds like paranoia, a female nanny will steal away her spouse, a male nanny might \"hurt\" the kids.\n\nI think marriage counseling or a mental health evaluation might not be out of line.", "I think the main reason she threw it away was the smell (and lack of space), and the casually-mentioned part is that it's illegal.\n\n\"So our apartment was smelling like rotten milk for the last two weeks -- and my boyfriend's attitude was 'oh it's fine' and 'just deal with it for a little longer' until I pulled the plug and threw it all out this morning. I was looking at my groceries, which I had to put beside the fridge because there was no space, and everything smelled like death, and then I kinda snapped and threw it all away.\"", "It's pretty obvious that a large number, if not the majority of people in this sub, are not in active relationships, have never been in relationships, and/or are just projecting their own insecurities from their past relationships as a form of \"advice\".\n\nThis sub is quite frankly just rage porn for people. It really doesn't help that a lot of submissions are also straight up fake to cater to that crowd.", "Currently most daycares that cover the normal 9-5 are waitlisted for 2+ years. It's one of those things currently fucked beyond belief in our economy, just like housing and food prices.", "You know this is going to happen. She's going to expect him to pick up the kids from day care since he's working from home and will then feel threatened by the women who are caring for her kids. \n\nOP needs to insist that she not only find a solution for the childcare problem she has created but she also needs to find a therapist.  Her problem is not going away on its own.  She's in danger of destroying her marriage.", "Yeah its such a shitty opinion. over 900 upvotes and every single one of them is a naive non-adult. yes, punish children by denying them the appropriate care because *checks notes* one person in the family is a few fries short of a happy meal. \n\nare you people completely out of your trees?", "Simple. Kids get signed up for daycare. Danielle acts insane and belligerent to the staff. Kids get kicked out and word travels through the professional community that these people, or at least Danielle, are not worth the the drama that comes with doing business with them.", "Right? My sisters refer to my husband as 'the baby whisperer\". We started having kids first, and my husband was and is super hands on. When my sisters starting having kids and we saw them, he would automatically rock, carry, feed, soothe etc distressed infants and small children, lol. And he was good at getting them calm.", "Yeah I love kids but I won\u2019t interact with ones that aren\u2019t mine unless my wife or daughter are with me. Other wise I\u2019m just the creepy guy who is potentially a molester. Feels bad :(", "Oh I agree. I don't think she is right. Or even that this is what the issue is. I was just seeing so many \"did someone cheat\" posts... and like, offered an alternative reason why one might be insecure.", "And if the daycare employes MALES??? That's wierd!!/s", "> hussies \n\nThat's what my grandmother used to say, 30+ years ago, when she saw girls wearing shorts.", "Male role models in care taker roles are good for kids! It\u2019s crazy people are so weird about it. \n\nEspecially since women harm children too.", "Man the first time a male friend told me this and explained the reasoning my heart just broke. I had just never really thought about it.", "All named Jerry", "I'm in my 40s, I've decided some people are just a ball of barely contained emotions. They constantly blurt out opinions and descriptions of whatever crosses their field of view. They can be ok to be around if you treat them like spoiled children, but generally they are exhausting and probably have some fragile definition of \"who they are\" that they have to test a few times an hour.   \n \nAfter being around them for awhile you get tired of being so patient with them and steering the conversations to be more constructive that you just let them dig their own hole, but then you end up in situations like OP, and the resentment builds.", "Some tasks are small for the person but take time and so become bottlenecks. If you get up to make a coffee mid-morning then you can dump the clothes (and detergent) in the washing machine while the jug boils.  If you get up to make a coffee mid-afternoon then you can dump the clothes in the dryer. If you put it in your calendar to do on set days,  it needn't be a burden to remember. \n\n It ends up being a 5 min job for you because you're home.  But to the person working outside the home it becomes quite a large task to manage amongst the other things that have to be done at night.", "My husband did the same when I worked from home for a week, and I shut that down fast.  We sat down and laid out our expectations.  When he wanted everything done, I told him it was unreasonable, so I didn't do anything the next day.  He got the point quickly, as I timed his ass, and understood he had flawed expectations.", "I read it as more trying to control ops but also not understanding how budgets and wfh work", "or she's trying to isolate OP. Her behaviour sounds pretty paranoid. She doesn't what the nanny, she doesn't want his parents, she surely won't like the daycare... it's almost as if she wished for him to be only with the kids, no work done. She already managed them to move to another city where they do not have any family. It's weird aff and, I might be overthinking this, but what if she has undiagnosed psychiatric problems??"]}
