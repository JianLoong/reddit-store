That is money your dad worked hard for to either provide through a life insurance policy or saved up for you. She didn\u2019t do a damn thing for it and has done nothing to earn it. And depending on what country you\u2019re from she likely got child support through you.\n\nHer life choices are her own and her financial situation isn\u2019t your problem. Had you not gotten that money she would still have to come up with a solution. Use your money to set yourself up for a better future and honestly it\u2019s infuriating to hear she\u2019s trying to justify taking money from a man she clearly still holds resentment to. Don\u2019t piss on your dads grave by giving money to a person who speaks ill of him.", "NTA \n\nYour mom seems like one tho. \nI don't think you need to appease her with paying her bills or taking her on vacation\n\nAt the end of the day, your father chose who to will that inheritance to, so nobody else has any claim to it.", "NTA. And that is the answer in virtually every situation involving someone not giving part of an inheritance to another person who claims they\u2019re \u201centitled\u201d to it. \n\nYour father designated his beneficiaries because that is who he wanted to have those benefits when he died. That was his prerogative. Nobody else has a claim to them, moral or otherwise.", "NTA. Invest that money.", "YTA -For giving your mother anything. That money was left to you and I guarantee your father did NOT want anything to go to your mother. She sounds like an entitled narcissistic person. \n\nDo NOT pay off her bills or take her on vacation. Do NOT give her money. Once she inherits she will not reciprocate or return the money. If it\u2019s a substantial amount of money, consider a financial advisor. Good luck!", "OP your mom made her own decisions, although they may have been bad ones, and is in the situation that she's in.  Your dad determined this is the way he wanted the monies divided, and your mother and sister are using emotional blackmail to have you give up your share of what was directed towards helping give you a better life.\n\nOne of the goals that parents are supposed to impart on their children, is give them a better life.  This is what your dad is doing.  This is NOT what your mom is doing.  Ask yourself if you were in the same situation with your own child, wouldn't you want to give them a better life than what you had?", "NTA. She has had her share. This is yours. If she didn't manage her share well, you should not be liable for that. But if you can manage yours well (i.e. through smart investment), you can not only grow your share, but also help you to raise your credit score and may be give some to help your mom instead (in the long run). Don't look to the short term as most people do. Look at the long term reap, but a more sustainable one.", "NTA she is entitled to exactly 0.00% of this money.", "NTA... you have been generous to help her with debts and vacation...

Do not pay off your mothers debts and don't take her on an international holiday. \n\nSo what your mother \" had to put up with him \" she chose to be with your father that's on her and her decisions in life are also hers. Besides as you've said they've been seperate for 13yrs and she can't all of a sudden decide to stake claim to what's yours is also mine.\n\nSave yourself any further grief and heartache by not paying her bills, speaking to a financial consultant and leaving the money in an account that she can't touch. \n\nYou owe her absolutely nothing.", "Do not take her on a holiday.

For himself.  He is 21 years old. I don't have much money but as he has been in college I try to help him out now and then.  This is the deal, if your mom wasn't so entitled I would say sure give her some from you.  Why not.  She's your mother.  But something seems off about it. \nYou should ask yourself these questions. Is she OK? Does she have food and shelter and clothing? If the answer is yes ok.  You're conscience is clear.  The truth is there us nothing wrong with lifting a burden from your mothers shoulders.  But at your age it shouldn't be a manipulative situation.   Do what you can.  Invest.  Get some help with investing in gold silver or whatever so the money doesn't lose value.  And take maybe 25 percent for yourself your mom fun etc.  Whatever you do don't keep it in cash.  Cash is almost worthless.   Just try to be kind and don't be manipulated. You sound like a good kid.  I don't think your mom is entitled to anything but there's nothing wrong with being kind to your mom.  I lost my mom last year and I know no one ever gave me as much as she did.  We can never repay our moms.  But we don't have to be manipulated either.", "NTA unless you give your mom money.\n\nKeep your money, and don't let your mother drain your inheritance.
