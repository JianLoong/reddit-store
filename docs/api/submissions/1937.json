And  now I'm on my own.\n\nI specifically did this so I wouldn't be on my own too much because me MH is bad. \n\nEDIT TO ADD: I wanted him to wake me after she had left, about 1 or 2 hours probably but i didnt want to wake up before he was back from seeing her or before he left, so I didnt set an alarm. \n\nTLDR: My boyfriend says he couldnt wake me up, despite being able to whenever I need to go somewhere, and didnt do other important things for me, so I woke him up and very angrily told him was really angry and accused him of trying to upset me", "created_utc": 1668053499, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yr4xsr/aita_for_arguing_with_my_boyfriend_because_he/", "score": 84, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But based on your comments, I would still say something\u2019s up there, because in your comments I don\u2019t get the \u201cmature\u201d vibe.", "Thank you for answering my question.  It sounds like you will (probably) be ok. Take care.", "\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af that\u2019s my opinion", "Yeah, alarm clock should be your 1st step. I normally set up 4 alarms over a half hour and 1 alarm each hour for the next 2 hours. Then ask my husband if he doesn\u2019t see me by a certain time if he can make sure I\u2019m up, but this is because sometimes my blood sugar drops when I\u2019m sleeping so it\u2019s harder to wake. However, even with that medical issue the first step is always trying to get myself up.", "I'm currently dealing with a trial so I've had a ton more flashbacks, nightmares and spiralling so it's just a lot nicer to wake up with someone there to help me feel safer. It's not needed but its deffinately a lot nicer.", "Nah it's because my mum and dad usually wake eachother from naps and whoever's awake first wakes the other for things. Almost daily. And its allways worked for them. They clearly got something right to have been together so long.", "Where I live, considering it's not exactly a secret to anyone we know and no one in our personal lives has any issue it seems ok to.me.", "either way, sorry if i seem judgy, but i find it very disturbing that someone in his twenties was attracted to a teenager/minor. one piece of advice i\u2019ll give you, watch out for that. And think, if you were a grown ass adult, would you be attracted to someone that hadn\u2019t graduated high school?", "He stays up all night in order to be able to wake you up? That seems weird and maybe codependent", "It's a common occurrence to remind him of some stuff, sometimes it's simple as having to drink or eat something, sometimes its having to go back to the shops and sometimes its stuff like this. \n\nI do think he tries and I'm a lot less annoyed now and not angry about it, I just find it annoying when something else has already made me irritated.", "We do manage and have for 1.5 years, our house is a bit messy but never gets unreasonable. We are both going to services that provide help and trying to figure that out individually, but being together has made him feel able to leave his mums despite her manipulation, find a better job, lose weight and his mental health has improved. \n\nPersonally I already lived alone but I now have a relationship with my mum and dad and go out more thanks to him. I also have the beginnings of working doing art, thanks to him as he bought me an ipad to do art on and has encouraged me every step.", "No he doesnt say stuff like that really. I personally have experienced other people seeming to think that or saying that but he doesnt.", "I will say all his exs are older than him and most of the people hes been with in any way, none are around my age. He infact refused to have a girl come to his place of work for being too touchy, because he was uncomfortable with someone childlike being flirty with him. And I think that happened twice but idk for sure I forget stuff.\n\nWe have only similar life experiences just at different times.", "I'm 19 it's literally a 2 year age gap above legal age? I dont get at all how this one is an issue.", "I managed to buy drink for friends at 16, I didnt get IDd. I also got mistaken for being older constantly by other people, I probably didnt look older than him but I didnt look the same age as my peers at all. \n\nI have mainly been around older people, usually 40s to 90s so I do act older, and get older references, because I'm usually doing stuff or chatting to people that age. \n\nI dont and didnt come off as a teen and that was clear to me then and now. \n\nHowever he has never commented on that to me, like I said.\n\nAnd i started dating him because he liked me, i liked him, he hasnt got a history of dating younger at all and EVERYONE I spoke to about him only had nice things to say, his ex came running up and hugged him and they had a really nice friendly conversation. He makes nice food and I love his singing.", "Ok that makes sense. Thank you for clarifying", "See, thinking that the only serious relationship you've ever witnessed is automatically correct and every other way is wrong is classic 19 year old thinking. I'm not trying to insult you, I was 19 too and thought I knew exactly what I was doing and what I wanted but spoiler alert I was a completely different person 5 years later. \n\nIt sounds like you have great role models for a strong relationship, but you can't force another person into that dynamic if it's not who they are and they're not willing to change.", "I mean, in the USA it\u2019s illegal.", "The thing I allways point out is I was strangled and abused by a guy who was a day younger when I was 14. He was the worst guy I've ever dated, huge mistake. I also dated a guy who's 2 pr 3 years older who never hurt or upset me and still if he sees me hes lovely. \n\nGuys can be any age and have the worst intentions, I allways keep my eyes open for issues or feeling controlled or upset. \n\nI also honestly looked like an adult for sure, there was nothing about me that looked under 20 or whatever. And genuine mistakes from.other people who thought I was over 20 and the lack of being IDd.", "Personally I'm pretty sure its coz hes not a fan of the dark, same reason hes going to bed at 3 30am. He gets tons of nightmares too and hes always wanted to.do it to the point I've set an alarm and hes woke me up slightly before it with food or something.", "That is some serious codependency and it isn't healthy. You both should be able to function as adults separately. You aren't his mother or caretaker. My suggestion: break up and learn to function on your own. You shouldn't rely on him to wake you up. He shouldn't rely on you to drink and eat.", "I hope for your sake that you\u2019re right. Keep your wits about you (and set an alarm).", "He probably didn\u2019t want to wake you because he was with the female friend longer than he was supposed to be and that is why he looked panicked and also why the cat was able to get into the garbage. He put the load of laundry in before he left. Your mad because he didn\u2019t wake you but he really had just gotten home. What was he up to all of that time.  I think there are bigger issues here and your not seeing them.", "Well, you still don\u2019t sound a day older than 19. But hey, not all stories are the same. I hope you\u2019re right.", "Right so I didnt think I was an asshole for asking to be woken up in a couple of hours because my parents do it. But also because my bf has never complained and at about 11 I'll be waking him up, he also usually is okay with waking me up and does it if it's the morning, he will stay up all night to do this without me asking. \n\nMost of what I want from a relationship is communication on what we both want and need and compromise and understanding. And if that fails or it feels wrong/ like I'm doing controlled or upset then I'm out.", "Well that's like me saying it's illegal for you to own a gun because int he uk it's illegal.", "The awful male who assaulted you and the male a few years older who is lovely shouldn\u2019t be justification. If you \u201calways point out\u201d these things then you\u2019ve had to rationalize it to others before, including yourself. How old you are told you look doesn\u2019t matter. \n\nDefinitely get an alarm clock and place it across the room so you don\u2019t snooze through it.", "I get what you\u2019re trying to say, but hands down it\u2019s wrong for an adult to look at a minor that way, sorry girl. now you guys are both adults, so it doesn\u2019t matter as much, but yeah. Anyways, you should probably use an alarm on your phone, humans are unreliable alarm clocks, believe me, my sister let me sleep in for work one too many times and i learned my lesson the hard way.", "Well I did live alone for a long time and I can set an alarm but I genuinely didnt think I was asking him to move the fucking earth for me. \nSometiems some adults do need reminders or dont eat or drink till extremely thirsty, he does that often and it's not healthy for him so occasionally I remind him at like 6pm that he hasnt eaten and he probably should, or get him a glass of water. People have apps to do it, and he could get one but he doesnt allways forget either.", "Will do haha", "The cat got int he garbage because he never took it out, he didnt even clean up the mess from it. The laundry he said would be \"finished soon\" 2 days ago, he just didnt dry it all for some unknown reason. \n\nI got some xbox achievement notifications and he had watched a lot of family guy on YouTube by the looks of my youtube history so I think he was home. He also knows I wouldn't have issue with him staying out longer with her.", "Then it sounds like this is a much deeper issue.\n\nAlso, waking someone up after a 2 hour nap in the middle of the night is totally different than waking someone up after a regular amount of sleep in the morning.\n\nYour body produces different hormones at night so it's totally plausible that he did try and you didn't wake up even if he has no issues other times.", "You avoided the question and then didn\u2019t say where you lived \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "It's not justification I guess I'm just trying to say anyone can be good or bad to date it's just who they are and their behaviour, thoughts and feelings. Me dating a 19yo doesnt make me more safe than dating a 25yo. What makes me safe is checking in with myself and making sure it still makes me happy and it's still a positive in my life to be in this relationship. \n\nAnd how old I look matters to a degree I think in my oppinion.", "I sincerely hope for you that you can get access to an amazing therapist who can help you realize this is not healthy behavior.", "She lives in the UK. And as a Brit myself\u2026.I would be grossed out by the age difference too. It\u2019s not illegal but doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not immoral.", "Are you happy? Because you don\u2019t sound happy in this post.\n\nAnd I totally get dealing with mental health issues, but it sounds like you basically don\u2019t want to be awake if he\u2019s doing something that doesn\u2019t involve you, which is alarming.", "I go to therapy \nI have an advocate / support worker\nI go to a building designed to support people and talk to a worker there too. None of these people have had a single problem and I am open and honest with them. They know him too. Maybe people should remember that they dont know everything about everyone"]}
