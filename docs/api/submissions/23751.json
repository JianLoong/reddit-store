I kind of skipped that phase when all my friends were buying it and figuring it out and i've gone through life make-up free. Before you think i'm a Not Like Other Girls girl, I think it's really cool on everyone else but it's just not for me.\n\nMy friend Jessie (27) is getting married and she picked me to be a bridesmaid along with 4 others. I don't really know the girls that well but I've known Jessie since I was in school and we've always kept in touch so she asked me.\n\nThe wedding is in a month from now. She's asked us all to wear dresses, high heels and she wants us to get our hair done and make-up done for the big day. I'm also not really a huge dress or heel wearer but I decided to go with it to make her happy. The only thing I'm against is wearing makeup. I don't want to look at the photos and look at a strange version of myself and feel uncomfortable.\n\nOne of the other bridesmaids decided that we should all go to lunch yesterday to talk about wedding things. I thought it would be a nice opportunity to get to know everyone better so I went. I thought it would be about planning a surprise gift for Jessie because it's been an idea that was floating around. Instead, the conversation drifted more towards our wedding looks so we could all look similar but different which is where I brought up that I wasn't going to wear make up, maybe eyeliner or lipstick at most.\n\nEveryone was really shocked and it's caused a sort of divide between me and the other girls. They all know each other better than me having been friends with Jessie in university. They were trying to persuade me to wear make-up to make her happy because it's her wedding and what she wanted us to wear as part of our dress code. I tried telling them that I'm already pushing my comfort level just wearing a long dress and heels over 4 inches high but they wouldn't listen and they made me feel like I was being selfish.\n\nI called Jessie to talk about it and ask if it would be a huge deal for me not to wear make up and she said it was okay but she was disappointed I couldn't suck it up for one day. It's not even like I have acne or any visible scars, my skin is very clear and I look after it well which is another reason I don't want to wear any. Now she and the other bridesmaids apparently made a Pinterest board of no-makeup makeup looks and have fired it into the groupchat and they all trying to persuade me to wear it. Saying that it's not like it's a permanent change to the way I look and I'll have so much fun at the wedding I'll forget i'm wearing it.\n\nAm I an asshole for not wanting to wear makeup? I see where they're coming from but also I'm trying to be the most comfortable I can be on what is going to be a really busy day.\n\nETA - If I knew it was going to be a requirement when I accepted this role, I wouldn't have and attended as just a guest. Jessie asked me if I was willing to be a bridesmaids as soon as she was engaged which was months ago", "created_utc": 1691013891, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15glh04/aita_for_not_wanting_to_wear_makeup/", "score": 348, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A good MUA worth their salt in the bridal industry will do what they can to make you comfortable. A no-makeup makeup look to simply enhance your features is a great compromise. And if it\u2019s done right by a good professional, you shouldn\u2019t feel awkward or out of place. The whole idea is to give you more confidence. \n\nMy advice is to check out the MUA beforehand (or find one of your own\u2014not super clear if they\u2019re expecting you to use the same MUA, although that\u2019s the easier solution) and have them do a trial for you. You\u2019re not the bride, so it\u2019s not normal to do a trial, but it might be good for you to talk to the artist, discuss what you\u2019re looking for, discuss what you\u2019re comfortable with, and have them do an application on a random day\u2014NOT the wedding day. Live in that makeup for the day and see how you feel.", "i mean they\u2019re literally not asking you to go full glam\u2026\n\ni do get that you\u2019re trying with the dress and heels, but that\u2019s like the bare minimum to be a bridesmaid you kinda do have to fit the aesthetic the bride wants, you can\u2019t just wear what you want\n\nalso as someone else pointed out, they\u2019re not your photos, you won\u2019t be the one hanging them up in your house (do ppl do this with photos of the bridal party or is this only for the bride and groom photos)\n\ni also don\u2019t think you\u2019d be doing your own makeup so you can\u2019t use the excuse that you\u2019re not good at it if someone else is doing it, this also relates to not looking good, if they\u2019re a professional doing a no makeup look, they\u2019re enhancing your features not changing them \n\nsoft YTA", "Yeah you\u2019re in the wrong honestly, it\u2019s one day not even a full 24 hours. What\u2019s the big deal with wearing it for a short period of time to make your friend happy. I\u2019d wear the ugliest dress and makeup up etc if my friend told me to for her wedding because that\u2019s what friends do.

You're creating drama around you when there shouldn't be any. This is the type of thing we do for friends, so stop turning this into a big deal and just suck it up. Go home after the wedding, wash your face, and it'll look the way you like it. (And don't worry about the wedding photos - they aren't yours anyway.) YTA", "YTA. This is not about you and how your pictures will look. \n\nLol at your comment that you want to be the most comfortable that you can be. You should have said NO to being a bridesmaid then!", "I don\u2019t wear makeup so I understand not wearing it. However you aren\u2019t going to be looking at the pictures. She is for hopefully the next 50 years. Suck it up and put in the makeup.", "It's one day. They won't be *your* photos because it's not *your* wedding. They're not asking you to go full drag queen glam. You're overly concerned with comfort for what will essentially be a few hours of your life. You keep mentioning how clear your skin is - so is mine. So what? If the bride wants me to get my face done, I'll do it. She's not asking you to get plastic surgery.\n\nYou shouldn't have accepted the request to be in the bridal shower if being outside of your comfort zone causes you such distress.", "YTA.\n\nYou're in the bridal party. That comes with demands about your appearance. You will only be wearing the bridesmaid's dress, hairdo, and make-up for a few hours. Your makeup will be applied by a professional so you don't have to worry about doing it yourself.\n\nOver the years people have become more and more inflexible. Step outside of your comfort zone for a few hours. It isn't that big of a deal.\n\nI don't regularly wear tuxedos but have worn them when I was a groomsman. I wear hats everyday and have for years. When that isn't allowed because of the dress code I suck it up and go without it.", "Gently, YTA, and you need to step down as a bridesmaid before this becomes a disaster.\n\nYou're arguing with everyone in the comments about how you just absolutely cannot do this. You can't compromise, you don't want to. You keep saying that it makes you too uncomfortable, and most commenters aren't really understanding what you're trying to communicate - they keep telling you it's \"just one day\" and that you \"should do it to make your friend happy\". \n\nBut I understand. I understand because I have Sensory Processing Disorder. And while you do not, you mention dysphoria in the comments, and feeling deeply uncomfortable and \"not like yourself\". I understand what it is to feel like something on your skin is just WRONG, and you would do ANYTHING to get it off. That it makes you feel absolutely awful.\n\nI get it, and I have every bit of  empathy for you. \n\nBut in this case, it does not mean that you get to refuse to wear makeup as your friend's bridesmaid. It means that you need to tell her that you are so grateful for the opportunity, and you adore her, but you cannot do what she needs you to, so you are going to have to step down from the role and just come as a very enthusiastic guest.\n\nAnd you need to do that because I know what you're going through . . . and if makeup triggers dysphoria for you, and anxiety, then all of these suggestions and compromises aren't going to be the solution, they're going to be an absolute disaster. Because I saw the comment where you said \"what if I change my mind on the day of the wedding\" . . . and I know that that's exactly what's going to happen. You already have your mind made up that YOU DO NOT WANT MAKEUP TO TOUCH YOUR FACE. You can't cope with it. And no matter what, you're going to end up breaking down on the day of and refusing makeup . . . and you're going to absolutely ruin the bride's day. \n\nShe's going to be in a panic about how the pictures will turn out, about you standing out from the other bridesmaids, about people making comments . . . and YTA because some part of you already knows deep down that there is absolutely no way you're going to wear makeup to that wedding, so this will be 100% your fault. \n\nYou don't have to wear makeup or do anything else to your body that makes you feel so deeply wrong and not like yourself. But then you don't get to be a bridesmaid. That's the choice. And YTA - a huge one - if you let this get any further and ruin your dear, dear friend's wedding day with last-minute nonsense.", "YTA, it's not your day. You can get very light, natural makeup look for the day; I think you need to compromise on this. The bride has already left you wear different shoes. \n\nI've been a bridesmaid before and have had to wear some unflattering dresses, uncomfortable shoes or wear my hair a particular way for the wedding. These were not my choices but it made the brides happy. It comes with the role of being a bridesmaid.", "I wonder if you're ready to hear any suggestions at all?\nPeople are very kindly giving you marvellous ideas on this thread and you're rejecting every one of them.\n\nI wonder if you really need to think about what's driving this resistance.\n\nI feel sorry for your friend. Organising weddings is stressful and shepherding a person through what is frankly a perplexing anxiety must just be adding to it.\n\nYTA. Piss or get off the pot.", "Honestly yeah YTA. Just suck it up for one day. It\u2019s not like she is asking you to dye your hair or remove a piercing. She\u2019s asking you to put on makeup which is expected of every bridesmaid at virtually every wedding ever.", "Quite frankly, YTA. It's not your day and you're a bridesmaid. I'm the exact same as you, never wear dresses, makeup, heels, nothing. I hate it, makes my skin feel uncomfortably tight, and think I look terrible. That being said, I did all that for my cousin's wedding because it's her day and the dress code. Literally only time I've worn makeup and I'm 26. I wasn't even in the bridal party. You're creating unnecessary drama.", "Ok. I was going to give a different judgement bc I haaaaaaate hate hate that men are allowed to be \u201cenough\u201d with their plain old faces and women have to wear makeup to look \u201cpresentable\u201d at events etc for some reason. I have zero judgements about people who love it, I wear it myself often as part of my job or a little to feel more confident- it\u2019s the requirement that is so stupid. It should be preference. \n\nHowever\u2026. I read so many of your responses here and honestly, you sound like a little kid having a tantrum. If you had severe gender dysphoria and this messed with you psychologically or if you had extreme sensory anxiety around something touching your face\u2026ok. But basically you are just making a huge deal out of feeling somewhat uncomfortable for a day to make your friend happy. \n\nI\u2019ve never, ever been 100% happy with any bridesmaid look I\u2019ve been assigned. Often I feel ridiculous. But that\u2019s the gig you signed up for. Get on board and stop stressing your friend out during an already stressful time. YTA I\u2019m afraid. \n\nThen go fight the patriarchy and make societal change however you can, and be sure to ask the requirements of things before you say yes.", "YTA. I don\u2019t actually think you\u2019re an asshole but for this sub, you\u2019re the \u201casshole\u201d in the situation. \n\nEven just light, well done makeup can vastly improve the photos. It\u2019s not about you having bad skin and I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t as you say. It\u2019s about powder stopping the light or sun glare on skin, things like that. I\u2019m sure you look great, I\u2019m sure you look great in photos. I know people who aren\u2019t into makeup and photography don\u2019t really get it but the difference is quite noticeable to people versed in both. The weddings I\u2019ve been involved in, translucent powder was also applied to the men for the glare reason specifically. \n\nYou\u2019re already not the most comfortable you can be if you\u2019re wearing a dress and heels you\u2019d only wear for her. You knew those would be an expectation of the role, and it\u2019s silly to think that makeup wouldn\u2019t be part of that. \n\nI mean do I think you should have to wear fake eyelashes, full glitter cut crease instaglam style makeup? No. Do I think people should have to wear that heavy heavy makeup that covers tattoos and ruins clothing? No. But even just some powder and mascara will make a difference to the camera.\n\nThe photos are for the couple. The day is for the couple. I would just suck it up for one day.", "Why would you even post to reddit if you\u2019re just going to argue with everyone in the comments and make excuse after excuse because you don\u2019t like the verdict? YTA 100%. It\u2019s one day. If your friend really matters to you then suck it up and be uncomfortable for one day. If you\u2019re THAT self-centered then back out of the wedding now and save your friend the trouble of having to worry about making HER day about you.", "Gentle YTA, from someone who also hates wearing make up and almost never does (the exception being, you guessed it... weddings). Think of it as part of the dress code. It's one day, it's not going to be the end of the world.", "YTA!! you could wear make up for one day, you don't have to do foundation and all that, wear light eye shadow and mascara. The photos aren't for you they are for your friend.", "YTA it's just one day and it isn't about you. you can wash it off after the pictures are done. with that said I GET IT. makeup always feels gross especially foundation and mascara. since you've said you have really nice skin, you probably don't even need foundation and since you're willing to wear eyeliner, you won't need mascara. blush and highlighter is usually pretty light and you won't notice it. they're willing to compromise and give you options so maybe you should consider it. the makeup artist will know what to do and make you comfortable.", "Hate to say this but you got to bite the bullet either by wearing makeup or not being a bridesmaid. \n\nIf you had allergies/moral/religious reasons I would have rooted for you, but this is just you don't like it. But seeing as this day isn't about what you like but what the bride likes.\n\n\nI nearly had to go to a wedding where the bride wanted me to wear Hot pink tight mini dress (I do not do pink) wear heels I was going to have to practice walking in for a month (I don't do heels) and then for the cherry on top of what I considered tacky bridesmaid look, was informed I would have to wear \nwhat myself and many other people considered wolverine nails, (I grow my nails long naturally) the bride wanted us all to go out and get fakes done with hot pink and light pink swirls with a splash of gold glitter. I wasn't happy with any of this by any stretch. But it wasn't my day so because I wanted to be a part of her day I agreed to it all (I have never been so thankful a wedding fell through) \n\n\nI will add that after all this, if you back out this late in the game you will get backlash and Jess won't be happy. Or she will be happy not having to cater for you (it could go either way)", "I (38F) am someone who does not wear makeup often, if ever. I will put on some mascara & eyeliner & lipstick for a nice dinner. For my wedding I went all out - full face with fake lashes and all. I still looked like me, just more colorful. It\u2019s not going to hurt you or your skin to wear some subtle makeup for a few hours to make your friend happy at her wedding. The day is not about you, it\u2019s about her. Just do it & don\u2019t be a whiner. YTA.", "YTA.\n\nIt's not your wedding, and the request being made is pretty reasonable. As a bridesmaid , you'll be in a lot of pictures. The photos aren't for you, they're for the bride and groom. At your own wedding you can wear whatever you want. Nobody cares whether you feel like like you look like yourself, because you are not the main character here.\n\nYou are acting like this is cosmetic surgery, and that you'll suddenly be unrecognizable if you put on mascara. It's really not about whether you have acne or not, it's just that the bridal party wants a cohesive look so that one person isn't in blue eyeshadow and purple lipstick with a 2 foot bouffant while the other looks like they just got back from Woodstock without stopping for a shower. You seem to think you're naturally pretty enough to look identical to others wearing makeup, but trust me you'll stick out like a sore thumb, especially with all the harsh lighting. Normally bridal parties get a makeup artist, so you're already pretty lucky the bride is so laid back --- why dig in your heels to make this wedding about you and your comfort? Weddings are not comfortable as a general rule. \n\nOne question: how do you feel about having your hair styled for the event, with tons of hair product and heat tools? In what way is this better than a bit of concealer and blush, some mascara and some lipgloss for a no makeup look?", "YTA - bridesmaids wear the dress and the shoes, get the hair done, and wear the makeup. It\u2019s all part of the package. You won\u2019t die if you wear some makeup. It\u2019s not permanent. You can suffer through for a few hours.", "YTA\n\nHonestly it\u2019s standard to wear make up as part of the bridal party. The onus was on you to clarify at the start \u201cwill I need to wear make up?\u201d and you chose not to. While your friend knows that you never choose to wear make up, it\u2019s part of the accepted wedding culture and she shouldn\u2019t have needed to clarify with you. \n\nYes, you are being an asshole. It will not harm you and it is temporary. It is not like she is asking you to dye or cut your hair.", " YTA.\n\nI am a man, and I definitely don't wear makeup.\n\nIf my high school friend wanted me to come in full drag makeup as is groomsman I would happily oblige to make him happy.\n\nYou don't have an allergy, you just don't like it. What difference does it really make?", "You could ask the make-up artist to give you a very light look, but I would be far more worried about the 4 inch heels. I wouldn't be able to walk in them and would likely break something if I tried. My tiny feet would be on tip toes.", "YTA.  I say this as a makeup free person who thinks weddings are dumb: This is not your day, and nothing in this day is about you.  The decisions aren't yours, the photos aren't yours.

I'm just really bad at it and don't think it suits my face. I kind of skipped that phase when all my friends were buying it and figuring it out and i've gone through life make-up free. Before you think i'm a Not Like Other Girls girl, I think it's really cool on everyone else but it's just not for me. \n\nMy friend Jessie (27) is getting married and she picked me to be a bridesmaid along with 4 others. I don't really know the girls that well but I've known Jessie since I was in school and we've always kept in touch so she asked me. \n\nThe wedding is in a month from now. She's asked us all to wear dresses, high heels and she wants us to get our hair done and make-up done for the big day. I'm also not really a huge dress or heel wearer but I decided to go with it to make her happy. The only thing I'm against is wearing makeup. I don't want to look at the photos and look at a strange version of myself and feel uncomfortable.\n\nOne of the other bridesmaids decided that we should all go to lunch yesterday to talk about wedding things. I thought it would be a nice opportunity to get to know everyone better so I went. I thought it would be about planning a surprise gift for Jessie because it's been an idea that was floating around. Instead, the conversation drifted more towards our wedding looks so we could all look similar but different which is where I brought up that I wasn't going to wear make up, maybe eyeliner or lipstick at most.\n\nEveryone was really shocked and it's caused a sort of divide between me and the other girls. They all know each other better than me having been friends with Jessie in university. They were trying to persuade me to wear make-up to make her happy because it's her wedding and what she wanted us to wear as part of our dress code. I tried telling them that I'm already pushing my comfort level just wearing a long dress and heels over 4 inches high but they wouldn't listen and they made me feel like I was being selfish. \n\nI called Jessie to talk about it and ask if it would be a huge deal for me not to wear make up and she said it was okay but she was disappointed I couldn't suck it up for one day. It's not even like I have acne or any visible scars, my skin is very clear and I look after it well which is another reason I don't want to wear any. Now she and the other bridesmaids apparently made a Pinterest board of no-makeup makeup looks and have fired it into the groupchat and they all trying to persuade me to wear it. Saying that it's not like it's a permanent change to the way I look and I'll have so much fun at the wedding I'll forget i'm wearing it.\n\nAm I an asshole for not wanting to wear makeup? I see where they're coming from but also I'm trying to be the most comfortable I can be on what is going to be a really busy day.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Guess you need to decide what is important to you.  Of course, it is you right to not wear makeup, and some women don\u2019t need it.  My daughter is one.  But some women look more polished with just a bit.  And then of course, there are the women who take a shovel and just pile it on.", "ESH. I really, really hate this trend of brides nitpicking their bridal party\u2019s appearance. People want uniform models at their wedding, not their friends and family as they actually really look. \n\nBut on the other hand, makeup seems like a bit of a silly hill to die on IMO. It\u2019s only a temporary change to your appearance that you can wash off that night.

It\u2019s one day for someone else\u2019s wedding. My niece took the same stance for her sisters wedding.

I can see if you weren\u2019t a bridesmaid obviously, but common it\u2019s not your wedding. And just because your friend (the bride) says that it\u2019s ok , just do it for her anyway.

Also, the maximum amount of time to find that replacement. \n\nSeeing that dress code, shrugging, and deciding it wasn't going to apply to you without immediately talking to the bride is what makes you the asshole. She deserved a frank and honest conversation the minute you knew you couldn't meet her expectations. Blowing it off, and then bringing it up in a group setting, not even to her, was not the right call here.\n\nI'm seeing a lot of \"suck it up\" comments, and screw that. You don't have to compromise yourself or feel guilty for not being willing to for any circumstance.

It was half a day, and it made my cousin happy. Afterwards, I showered and donated the dress. Over twenty years later, when I come across pictures of me at that wedding I laugh.

I asked if I could go with a 2 inch or some heels that were a little big chunkier so my balance wouldn't be so off but she said no so decided to go with it instead of dropping out.\n\nI do have photos of myself at family weddings in my house, I was wanting to put up a photo of me and Jessie on my wall too because this is a big moment.\n\nI just added that in for context of how I never really got used to wearing makeup and that's why I think it makes me so uncomfortable now because I never saw that like change in the way I look", "Yeah I agree with this. As a bridesmaid, you can suck it up even if it's not a look you would normally choose.\n\nFor my sister's wedding, the bridesmaid dresses were all a blush pink which is not a colour that I would ever choose for my skin tone. I didn't say a word and wore the dress she liked. All the bridesmaids decided to go with fake eyelashes which look kind of weird on me because my eyes are wider than standard length fake eyelashes.

She only engages with people saying it's NBD because she wants to convince them she's right. If anyone mentions dropping out of the wedding she disappears. \n\nSo while I agree with you that OP appears to have some type of major illness when it comes to her perception of her appearance (incl. things like compulsively looking at photos of herself), I'd say the actual issue that people here are picking up on is that she's completely self-absorbed and genuinely believes that her comfort is more important than the bride's comfort.

She's only here to have her self-centeredness vindicated, she doesn't want solutions.", "Honestly I\u2019m amazed that a bride would be panicked about a bridesmaid not wearing makeup.

Like go to Sephora, explain the situation, ask for no makeup makeup and an extremely light touch. If your skin is nice you honestly don't need full coverage foundation, which for me is also uncomfortable.

I would still suck it up if i planned to stay in the bridal party. Those are her photos, even if you hang them up. She is paying for the photographer likely. She has a right to a certain aesthetic that she wants in her paid for photos. I would do what others have suggested with a \u201cno makeup\u201d makeup look.

I am not trans, but I am a woman who does not wear makeup. I experience dysphoria when I try to wear makeup, and clothes that are particularly feminine. it is uncomfortable as hell.
