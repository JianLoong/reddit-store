I understand she was frustrated but didn't want to end up as their marriage counselor so I said something along the lines of \"I'm sure he'll make it up to you soon since it's your birthday too this weekend\"\nAnd uh.\nHe didn't.\nNo flowers, no chocolates, he didn't even get her a damned card. Her present? A gift card for the movie theatre. She's mysophobic.

That was yesterday. \nMy sisters spent the evening at M's parent's house and we went to a steakhouse. M had some wine so I asked my dad to pick us up. He did come to the restaurant and I paid for the meal, so other than $5 of gas he had no expenses, but he completely lost his shit at us in the car. Mostly at me.\nHe called me a spoiled brat, said how I've always hated him and how I am disgusting for taking my stepmom on a date. Like it wasn't a date bro but aight. How my childish attempts at \"emasculating him\" won't work and how he's still the patriarch of the family.

He could have easily done something for her, but he'd rather her have expectations in hell and not have to make any effort.\n\nAnd that bs about the patriarchy....it may be time to put some boundaries between you and them.", "you are very much NOT young man. you did a sweet gesture that should have been applauded by your dad. something else is happening with him and he took it out on you.\n\nbtw, your boyfriend sounds like a good partner and i hope you two have many happy years together.\n\nhave a blessed day!", "NTA. You did something lovely for your stepmom, in a filial duty kind of way. Def not a date. You have nothing to feel bad about. And I'm sorry that your family is making you question yourself.", "NTA\n\nTalk about being insecure. Your dad needs to grow up.", "NTA.  It is very sweet that you took her out for dinner for her bday.  Your dad is pissed because he didn't bother to do anything and it makes him look bad.  But that's his fault, not yours.", "NTA. You did a good and sincere thing. Shame on your father and grandma for refusing to see it as such. That\u2019s straight up insecurity. If it was that big of a deal he should\u2019ve done something considerate for her birthday.\n\nI don\u2019t blame your stepmom if your family can have so much friction over something so kind, she probably just doesn\u2019t want it to escalate further. I\u2019m sorry. I hope I one day have a daughter with even half of your empathy", "NTA\n\nYour father is toxic af and likely still ranting and raving about his own insecure nonsense. \n\nWhat you did was both kind and considerate.\n\nYour stepmother is in an unfortunate situation and seems to be shielding you from your father's irrational behavior. \n\nYour grandmother - you should talk to her in person and explain your side neutrally without your father being present.", "NTA.  And your stepmom didn't back you up?  That sucks.  Sounds like your dad is super abusive and she is afraid of him.  Sorry your dad and family are like this.", "NTA,\n\nYou did a nice thing, but you are never going to get your father to admit it. He has taken several steps to \"put you in your place\", but really this is to keep your stepmother from \"getting any ideas\" about whether a \"real man\" helps with housework or is considerate of birthdays, etc.\n\n(Likewise his useless BD present to her was to tell her not to expect anything.)\n\nThis is all about your dad's control over your stepmom.  It's not your fight, so since it appears you've moved out I suggest you leave it.", "NTA. Your dad is being ridiculous and his wife and mother are placating him because they feel they have to.", "NTA all you did was take her out to dinner for her birthday. You wouldn't have done that if your dad actually put anything into his marriage. Tell your dad he needs to stop watching step porn.", "Dad is mad because he got shown up.", "Nta- you wouldn't even be the asshole if you cut contact with them. I understand you probably won't because of your siblings. But damn, this sounds toxic and abusive af.", "NTA. Dude. Everybody involved sounds fucking wack. You did a very thoughtful, kind thing and it sounds like ya dad has a lot of issues he needs to examine. Grandma and M are gonna placate him but you didn\u2019t do anything wrong. I\u2019d distance from your family and do what makes YOU happy.", "Aw this makes me feel sad for your SM. All you did was take to a birthday dinner! A completely normal thing to do with a parent or step-parent (if you have a good relationship). Your grandma is entitling his stupid stance and your SM is made to feel terrible. Of course, your dad is a massive jerk. NTA.\n\nINFO: Did your dad know you were going ahead of time? Like, hey Dad, I'm going to take M to dinner for her bday or was this sprung on him. If it's the latter, I can get why he'd be a little irritated and feeling bad for not doing anything for her bday but his reaction is still OTT", "NTA  Tell them that they are ridiculous and block them", "When I read the title and the first lines, I was gonna say YTA, but then I read the whole text and it sounds like your dad is a bit paranoid and blew everything out of proportion.

I really don't see how you treating her to dinner is more emasculating than him running to his mommy about it.", "NTA! Has your dad ever displayed any homophobic tendencies? If so, could it maybe have been an excuse to uninvite the two of you from the vacation? The whole \u201cpatriarchy\u201d and \u201cemasculating\u201d thing just screams homophobic to me, but I could be totally wrong.\n\nEdit: Just to be clear, you\u2019re one hell of a good person. And what you did was incredibly kind. This kind of thing makes me so, so sad- someone does something good for someone and gets shit on for it.", "NTA, but your dad sounds like an abusive jerk if I'm being honest here. Most likely why M isn't backing you up, because she has to live with him and she is afraid of the repercussions if she dies not keep the peace. As for your grandmother, well she did raise your dad to be the person he is today.", "NTA. Good for you for managing to fall far from that misogyny tree. I\u2019m sorry your grandma isn\u2019t backing you up. I guess it\u2019s clear where your dad gets his attitude.", "NTA\n\nI think that was a very sweet gesture on your behalf. I\u2019m sure it meant a lot to your step-mum.  Your dad and his mother sound like total As. Their behaviour is very controlling so I would ignore them", "NTA. Your dad's abusive, your grandmother is...whatever. Tell your stopmom that you love her, happy birthday, and you're happy to go do something else during the vacation. She has enough on her plate.", "NTA. Whining is always way easier than self-reflection but damn you're dad is a lot of work on so many levels ! So much insecurities / projection / gaslighting / anger issues / homophobia / jealousy and so on !! For absolutely no reason at all. If i was him i would be very proud of you and would find this very cute. The bond you and her share is precious and should make him happy. It doesn't even make sense. Good luck. Run as soon as you can. Very toxic environment. You deserve much better. Take care", "I'm so sorry he was such an asshole, and that the women in your life didn't appreciate you enough when you're the kindest stepson a person could hope for. \n\nHere's what you should have heard, and what you hear from all of these other commenters: thank you for being so sweet. Like, on behalf of humanity. Those little girls are so lucky to have you in their lives.", "NTA What you did was very kind!! From reading your other comments I'm sure it's been a LONG time since someone took your stepmother out and I'm sure she loved it!!\n\nI don't think that she is 'siding' with your father either. If he had that reaction in front of you and keeps bring it up, can you imagine what your stepmother is dealing with at home? Please don't hold it against her for not setting your dad straight, she's probably afraid of dealing with the after math.", "NTA aw hon.  You did nothing wrong, in fact you were very kind and considerate - something you clearly didn't learn from your dad.  He's a lousy husband, and sounds like a lousy father too, and looks like he learned to be that way from grandma.  \n\nI give you a lot of credit for seeing all this, including the unfairness of their home situation, and recognizing it for the problem it is, especially at your young age, and wanting to help. \n\nI don't think M dis-inviting you is about not backing you up, but likely trying to shield you from him a bit, and to keep the peace for the younger kids.  I hope she's able to remove herself from that marriage sooner or later.", "NTA but you know that. But wtf is wrong with your family man. Yeah, so I guess since your dad is being weird as fuck, your grandma is being weird as fuck, and your stepmom is being weird af for not backing you up. Like she just sat there and let you take all the fire because you tried to do something nice for her. IMO some low contact with that whole side of the family might be the move. They are all AH\u2019s.", "NTA, not at all. Your dad is pissed off because you made him look bad by thinking about his wife on her birthday while he didn't. That's not your fault, it's his.", "NTA.  That was sweet of you to show her appreciation and disappointing that she didn\u2019t support you.  Considering your dad\u2019s reaction, I would have talked to him first.  Sometimes guys just don\u2019t get that women like to get those things.  It\u2019s crazy, I know.  I\u2019m now wondering what he gets on his birthday\u2026", "Hmmmmmmm\n\nmmmmmmmm\n\nSorry, it is closer for me than I imagine it would be for most people. I definitely think your father overreacted. And at 19, well, setting up these things well is an art that requires practice.\n\n\\[Edit: I'm gonna go with NTA\\]\n\nI'd be interested to know how did you discuss this event and the planning of it with your father, and what did you discuss?\n\n\\[Addendum:\\] But on reflection, I think there is a big difference between making a faux pas and being TA. Even if you made a \"this just isn't done\" mistake somewhere along the way, being your recent adulthood and being of the gender that rarely takes the lead in social gestures, how are you going to learn? A proactive host or event organizer is transparent about their intents and receptive to ideas from the other parties, it is not an easy thing to do to set up a social event. The accusatory statements against you are way, way over the top.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Something set his fragile ego off LOL", "this is exactly what I was thinking too", "Ignorance of What, would you mind explaining?", "Ugh, not the grandkids thing. I\u2019ve been happily married for over 10 years and I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve been asked that. You\u2019d think eventually they\u2019d just stop asking, but nope. \n\nAnd honestly, if half the \u201cyoung men these days\u201d had your heart and mindset the world would be a much better place.\n\nEdit: Just checked your age again and goodness. That\u2019s very young for him to be asking that!", "And I am sorry for your stepmother but she will carry the burden of chores and childcare forever or until the divorce if she finally tries to rebel.\nBut do not change, you are great!", "Yep, this. He's mad because he knows deep down that he should have done something for his wife, but he can't be bothered. He's been divorced twice--I see a third divorce in his crystal ball in the future.", "The birds and the bees maybe?", "Off topic, it is Reddit of course.\n\nHow can any woman marry a two-time loser and think \"welp, I see what the other two women who had children with him don't see\"\n\nLike seriously women. Do better.", "Don't let the mother who raised him and the current wife who puts up with him make you feel like the crazy person. If they faced who he actually is, it would make them feel too much shame. \n\nNTA.

She deserves your father after that.\n\nTell your grandma, that archaic coffin dodger that you'll vogue it up on her grave.\n\nAnd as for your...patriarch father, the fact that he's himself is the greatest punishment of all.\n\nY'all did nothing wrong but, you should really do what the Scissor Sister's did when they sang \"Take Yo Mama Out\", except do it for your bio mom.\n\nMove the fuck out, your dad is cringe.", "NTA. In fact you are so much NTA I had to double take a few times and make sure I understand what I had just read. Your step mom is ungrateful, your dad is insanely immature, and your grandmother is totally out of line to even step in. Please try to get out of there as fast as you can.", "They say don\u2019t argue with crazy.  I\u2019m kinda getting that vibe from your dad here.  He\u2019s going to see what he sees and feel what he feels and logic and reason will mean nothing.  I have to assume he gave your grandma some skewed version of what happened.   NTA for trying to be a decent human being to your dad\u2019s wife.", "Awww, daddy had a tantrum! Poor lil guy. Let's all feel bad for the grown man who doesn't care about his wife. Or his other wife. Or his other other wife. What a loser, berating his son for his own shit behavior...\n\nNTA\n\nNo offense, OP. I know he's your dad and all, but like... what a toxic person.", "Lol, I'm looking forward to hearing about his next divorce. NTA.", "He had to get angry. Its to cover the feeling of being an absolute shit of a husband. You did a nice thing. Now you know not to do it again. \n\nNext time they bring it up reply, \u201cI had to because you sure didn\u2019t\u201d. NTA", "Oh so incredibly NTA. The world needs more people like you, you are truly not the problem.", "NTA, and don't take her saying it might not be best to go on the vacation with your sperm donor personally. She's trying to warn you. She lives with him, you don't. You don't know what he might have said and done to her after you left. Your grandma's just trying to validate her \"pwecious wittle baby boy\".", "NTA. Although I can\u2019t decide if getting your dad to pick you and his wife up was silly or a total boss move. I hope you did it just to really make your point.", "Huge NTA. You were trying to do a nice thing for someone else. Your stepmom is an ah for not backing you up when you did something nice for her. Your grandmother is an Ah for sticking her nose in your business. Your dad is the biggest Ah for being a shitty husband and shitty father", "NTA, you sound so sweet and considerate. I'm sure your stepmom really appreciated it but your dad is pressuring her to stay away from you.\nSo sorry!", "NTA. Of course he\u2019s mad. He did absolutely nothing for his wife\u2019s birthday but you made sure it was special for her. It just emphasized how much he sucks.

Being misunderstood is awful.", "NTA. The number of stories I see here about step kids who hate their step parents/want nothing to do with them, you'd think your dad would be happy it's the opposite case here...\nYou did something wonderful and I honestly hope M divorces your dad. She deserves so much better than him.", "Im so sorry. You sound windwrful. NTA", "NTA. Is your dad abusive? Because this definitely screams emotional abuse.", "Are you sure grandma has the whole and correct story? Sounds like she got the info from your dad, who probably isn't the most trustworthy narrator... NTA", "I agree that Dad is mad that the OP showed him up. The OP made  his dad look bad by doing what his dad should have done.\n\nSo is the OP an asshole for deliberately making his father look Bad?  \n\nI say yes. The OP is an asshole. And yes, it was damn easy to make the dad look bad. But that's not the point. He is an asshole for doing it regardless.", "He sounds verbally abusive at least so she's probably just taking the path of least resistance. Poor woman.", "Because blame the victim. It\u2019s pretty clear there\u2019s some sort of emotional abuse going on here.", "I actually just figured it was the most obvious thing to do. She had alcohol and I'm on very strong medication, so medically not advised to drive. I just called him because I figured it would be safest for us. BOI I was wrong", "I\u2019m trying to make you feel better here\u2026and I may not succeed, because it\u2019s not a very comforting notion of the possible future of your relationship with your dad, stepmom, etc, but your dad sounds a LOT like my dad. When I was your age and pretty much up til last year, I tried to make sense of this man and tried so hard to have a \u201cgood father-daughter relationship\u201d with him, according to him, but it\u2019s a 2-way street. Growing up with a guy like that, and he does really sound like my dad, warps your sense of reality. You haven\u2019t done a single thing wrong and you should not be iced out of your own family for being a caring son, step-son, and brother to your sisters. You don\u2019t deserve this. You really really don\u2019t. \n\nMy dad is on wife #4 now. They just got married a few months ago. He\u2019s the \u201cpatriarch\u201d of the household in all his failed marriages. Of which there have already been 3. No clue really how #4 is going to go, but it took me going along for the ride with each \u201cfamily\u201d my dad has created, and trying to fit into it every time and failing to realize hey- it\u2019s not me. It\u2019s my dad. It\u2019s the guy who gets married and divorced so much and sees people as disposable objects, accessories, chess pieces in his manipulation game he has to so carefully try to manage to maintain his illusions of himself. It\u2019s not me. I have a fucked up dad. And trying to make sense of him only hurts me more, because there is no sense. It\u2019s a feedback loop for driving yourself crazy.\n\nListen to your boyfriend. He\u2019s right. Your dad doesn\u2019t deserve a son as cool as you. He is a clown. Always remember you\u2019re dealing with a clown man that doesn\u2019t know a thing about maintaining healthy relationships, from one clown\u2019s kid to another. <3\n\nAlso with M\u2026it\u2019s hurtful. It really is. I\u2019ve been there with stepmom drama. But this is your dad\u2019s fault. He\u2019s manipulating her. She clearly appreciated you taking her out and had a great time. Your dad blows up and she\u2019s stuck in the house with him probably ranting about being \u201cemasculated\u201d by you\u2026which I - yknow guy needs serious mental help. And he probably practically forced her to be the one to disinvite you from this family vacation. It\u2019s fucked up. Allow yourself to acknowledge that and be hurt by it. Anyone would be. And remember this feeling, because it\u2019s only going to keep happening the more you sacrifice yourself to try to maintain your dad\u2019s idea of a father-son relationship. I\u2019m so sorry. I know how much these things can hurt, but you\u2019re not alone. And don\u2019t second guess your feelings here because they\u2019re valid. You can protect yourself and future you better if you allow yourself to look at how deeply fucked up the situation truly is.", "Your grandma is his mother, she's partly why he is such a shit human being. Your step mom is likely very afraid of your dad. Take what they say about this with a grain of salt. \n\n\n\nYou did a nice thing and your father is unhinged for behaving the way he did. You are an adult, there is no authority to rebel against. He has no power over you.", "You would think the \"patriarch\" would already realize how many times he has failed at relationships by now.  With his mother enabling all the way to the divorce court every time.", "NTA at all. You\u2019re a lovely person whose behavior contrasts sharply with your father\u2019s sh!tty behavior. He clearly has more issues than The NY Times, and he\u2019s utterly un-fixable. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019ve had to deal with this BS. The proof that \u201cit\u2019s him and not you\u201d lies in the swath of unhappy people he has left in his wake. Not sure if talking to your grandma would accomplish much, but only you can make that decision. Sadly, I can guarantee that you will never find a good relationship with your father. I learned decades ago that cutting toxic people (narcissists, which he definitely is) from my life gave me a sense of peace and tranquility I never would have found otherwise. You\u2019ll find your peace as soon as you see your father getting smaller and smaller in your rear view mirror. Good luck to you! \ud83d\ude42", "I'm sorry you are having to go through this. Your siblings are lucky to have you. What you did was a sweet gesture that shouldn't have been met with all that hostility.", "Right and I would love for it to be that easy but if I just go and fuck off what's going to happen to my siblings? I have to stick around at least until they're old enough to have their own phones etc. so I can contact them. Unless of course Mr Patriarch decided to patriarchically disown me. Would that make me my own Patriarch? Can I out patriarch him-", "Or he didn't give a f what they did, but while he was sitting at the tv he wanted some beer and his servant was not there, and at that time he had the epiphany... oh no, she went out for her b-day, and now she is going to have such expectations from me! How DARE HE go against the way I run MY house like this!!!", "Just overall ignorance on many lgbt topics or social issues. He's a very \"oh this has never happened to me specifically, therefore it simply doesn't happen\" type of person", "Yeah I wouldn\u2019t be mad at M. She probably got quite the haranguing when she got home that she was probably trying to protect OP with the suggestion that he doesn\u2019t go on the vacation with them.", "Dad lost his crystal balls apparently because son metaphorically cut them off...", "Yes, because you have a boyfriend which makes you \"double patriarchs\" or possibly even \"patriarchs to the power of 2\" both of which outrank the original.", "I have a psycho dad and a little half brother and I did exactly the same thing you\u2019re doing for as long as I could. I stuck it out until he was 14 and now I\u2019ve cut my dad out completely and my brother and I communicate independently and make plans to spend time together. \n\nOf course this only works if like my dad, your dad is too prideful to speak to you even to ban you from seeing your sibling. He could still very much forbid me from spending time with my brother since he\u2019s a minor but he won\u2019t which works out really well for me. \n\nI will say that I only made it until my brother was 14 and my mental health was shattered because of it. It honestly got to the point where I decided to walk away even if it meant losing my brother and having to wait until he was an adult to reconnect. I learned that I was no good to him if I was a broken shell of a person due to my dad\u2019s treatment. You have to put the oxygen mask on yourself first and all that\u2026 my point is, be there for your siblings but remember that walking away for your own sanity isn\u2019t abandoning them or the wrong thing to do.", "LOL perhaps!", "NTA. This is one of the most infuriating things with older women. It's disappointing and impossible to understand when you really see it for the first time. Much of the work women do to keep families together is catering to men's emotions in order to maintain the status quo. Standing up to his ego on this one risks a divorce and upsetting your sisters. Multiple lives upended. People will choose the path which is easiest rather than the one that is right. It is easier to remove you from the situation than to confront your dad because your removal causes less upheaval. That kind of betrayal hurts. I am sorry that is happening to you.", "You are an absolutely lovely person. NTA. \n\nBut the patriarch of your family sure is. \n\nI feel sorry for M. Your patriarch sounds like a nightmare. I actually wonder if the text really came from her. And if it did, I do also wonder if your patriarch is violent. He's definitely bordering on abusive imo.", "NTA, but your dad certainly seems to be. I don't think you did anything wrong at all personally.", "NTA", "NTA - wow you had me in the first half NGL. Then you dropped the bomb that you\u2019re gay and everyone knows it and now I\u2019m just so confused why everyone is mad.", "NTA\n\nAnd yeah your family is very strange.

Does your grandmother actually know what happened or did your dad tell her some BS? Considering what a shit husband he is (and from the bit you put here he ain\u2019t winning any father of the year awards) he probably lied or completely distorted the truth. Or your gran is just like him.\n\n2. As for your step mom - I just feel bad for her. She has a young child with this guy and as you said - works full time, parents full time, and cleans up full time. He has her too exhausted to fight for herself let alone anyone else. \n\nYou\u2019re not the AH you just treat people with decency - making assholes angry because they look all the more like assholes next to you.\n\nEdit - saw your comment that he\u2019s been divorced twice already.

That dinner was probably everything to her.", "NTA - You should\u2019ve been petty and texted your stepmom, \u201cFine I won\u2019t go on your vacation.

Run.  you sound like the only sane and polite one in that bunch.  Stay away from the psychos !!", "No NTA. Actually everyone sucks here except you, tbh. I agree with you about the \u201cpatriarch\u201d comment. It sounds like your family is dysfunctional and your stepmom appreciates what you did for her but doesn\u2019t want to back you up because she doesn\u2019t want to fight with your dad. Meanwhile, your father sexualizing what was a nice gesture just seems like he\u2019s gaslighting you. He knows that you have no sexual interest in your stepmom but he\u2019s contorting this gesture to make it look inappropriate because he knows that the real reason makes him look bad. He didn\u2019t like what you did because it made him look thoughtless.\n\nI hope at least your mom is backing you up.", "NTA. I have a dad like yours. This is not your fault. Step mom is likely not siding with you bc she is afraid of how your dad will treat her. I hate that you are in this position. I have no answers, only support from afar.", "Nta. Please dont be mad at stepmom. It seems your dad may be abusive. Shes trying to protect herself as she wont have your help on the daily.", "NTA. I mean, your grandmother raised your father. Are you *really* surprised that she has the same trashy opinions in the end? And your stepmom has to live with him. What else is she going to do?", "Your Dad was confronted with his poor life choices when it became obvious that his gay son was more a partner to his wife than he was.  So he has to 'project' his anger somewhere or else risk acknowledging his own shortcomings.", "NTA, at all.  Billions of stepmothers wish their stepchildren had a good enough relationship that they would take them out for their birthdays!  Your dad and stepmom and grandma are all AHs, not you.", "NTA  You did a very nice thing and you should stay with that.

Stay away (as much as you can if possible) from toxic relatives.", "NTA. You treated your stepmother to a birthday dinner. Something he should have done. \nStepmother needs to divorce him and be with a man who treats her right.\nDad mad gay son showed him up and showed what a real man does for a woman he cares about.\nYour dad has a disgusting mindset.\nMy bday and my grandpa's bday is literally side by side. Mine the 12th his the 13th.

Like what I did was wrong somehow.\n\nNo please don't, what you did was so thoughtful and kind. One of the many reasons I love your generation, so many of you are just good eggs who care about treating people well. \n\nI know it sucks that your gran and step mom aren't backing you up. I really think you dad told your gran some other story. Are you sure she knows the truth?\n\nAs for your step mom, looks like she's putting up with a lot of shitty behavior from your dad. I mean this in the kindest way possible - it's upto her to grow a spine. I don't know what's going on with her that she's not able to stand up to your dad, but it has nothing to do with you and its not your responsibility. I think distancing yourself from their marriage would be healthy for you.", "Did your dad make a fuss when you came out? Obviously you're NTA, but it's pretty obvious to me that he is angry about the fact a gay man is a better man than he is. Because he's a choice string of words I'm not allowed to say on here due to the fact it would be \"too mean\". Never mind that it's the truth. How dare a gay man topple his delusions of patriarchal grandeur....  \n\n\nI'm assuuming 'grandma' is his mother. Another hard pill to swallow, she's as much an asshole as your dad is and is likely the major factor in why he's a asshole. Your stepmom isn't backing you up because she's in an abusive relationship with an delusional manipulator who thinks his shit doesn't stink.   \n\n\nThe best thing you can do for yourself is to surgically excise them from your life.

It was a birthday meal for them both as well, not like it was just for her. If the father was offended it was because he didn't like someone, anyone even, making an effort to show that she mattered. And again, it's not like OP did this for the purpose of showing up his father.", "So making the dad look bad for doing literally nothing for his wife\u2019s birthday is morally worse than OP doing an act of kindness for her after seeing she\u2019s been going through a hard time\u2026?\n\nAre you OP\u2019s father lmao", "If dad looked bad because OP did a kind thing for a family member that dad couldn\u2019t be bothered to do, that\u2019s entirely on dad. \n\nBut thank you for announcing that you\u2019re the kind of person who rages at people who are more compassionate than you are. Enjoy being miserable.", "My mom ended up the same way for essentially the same reasons.

Sometimes it feels like no good deed goes unpunished, sadly.", "Fair enough. I wonder why Uber or similar wasn\u2019t an option but I do get you reasoning and on balance it was a boss move to get your dad to chauffeur you and his wife after you took her out. Definitely still NTA.", "I'm just wondering how on earth a man like your father managed to raise a kid who's biggest teenage rebellion is apparently taking their step mum out for a birthday dinner, who takes care of his younger siblings, who has a good relationship with and empathy for his step mum, who is responsible enough to not let anyone drink and drive and responsible enough to not drive while on medication, who has a good head on their shoulders... Like how???\n\nA round of applause to you for being the apple that catapulted yourself as far from the tree as possible.", "Absolutely.
