My daughter was very close to her dad and me and when she was at her sickest, she begged us to stay in the kids lives and make sure they always knew she loved them and that we were her family just as much. She mentioned how worried she was that her husband would encourage them to forget her and would try to replace her for them with a new woman. She asked that we leave anything we might have left her to her children. We assured her we would never let the relationship end and that we would make sure they had a good life and would remember her always.\n\nEight months after she died her husband moved his now wife into their home. She had a baby with someone else and was also expecting a baby with someone. At that point he did attempt to make it a package deal where we could not see our grandchildren without treating his now stepchildren as our grandchildren and that we were to treat all future children of his the same. Otherwise we would need to be cut out to give our grandchildren the chance to form the new family bonds without interference from us. That they deserved the chance to have another mother and only see the new children as true siblings.\n\nTheir lawyer told them we would have a case to get grandparents visitation. We also sought advice on if we were denied access, if we could obtain that. We were told given our close relationship with the children it would be easy to get access through the courts. This led to us getting minimal access but it was all that was needed because our grandchildren were glad to see us and their aunts, uncles and cousins.\n\nIn the last few years my former son in-law has found himself estranged from his own family and his wife's family are also no longer in the picture and he has 6 children (not counting my grandchildren) in his home with no family or support outside of him and his wife. Now that my grandchildren are teenagers they seek to spend more time with us and their lives have benefitted from it. We admittedly spoil them more than some would like because of the circumstances but they are wonderful children. Their father confronted me recently about his other children and how they have no extended family and are suffering seeing their siblings being spoiled. He also said we had already come between our grandchildren and their siblings because they are not close and have never asked for their siblings to be part of the extended family they have. He told me I owe it to his children to step in and give them love and some of the same spoiling. I told him I did not owe his children anything, and that I would never forgive him for what he attempted to do before.

No, it isn\u2019t the new children\u2019s fault, but you also aren\u2019t actively trying to hurt them. You\u2019re taking care of your grandchildren. They aren\u2019t your grandchildren. I have zero idea as to why this couple is estranged from both sides of their own families, but there is probably a lot more to that.

You, she, and her children are the only people that matter in this scenario.\n\nI am so incredibly sorry for your loss.", "NTA, but I would talk to your grandkids about being sensitive to the other kids' feelings when talking about their time with and gifts from you. They're old enough to understand that (and they might already be doing it). Also, maybe suggest they keep more expensive gifts at your house to help the other kids not feel so left out and abandoned by their own extended families?", "NTA, he could have handled things better in the beginning and given everyone a chance to be a big family but instead used the power he (incorrectly) thought he had to try and set conditions to you being in your grandkids' lives.  Now that they are older teenagers and he is losing more control of them and they will be presumably moving out in the next 3-5 years he is panicking because he probably benefitted from you \"spoiling\" your grandkids by having to buy them less stuff and not feed them and whatever else while you had them, when they move out he will get zero benefits moving forward so he's trying to squeeze something out of you now.", "NTA -- if he is estranged from his family it is likely on him.  He needs to find his own group of friends", "Your former son in law is disgusting. How can you deny access to the grandparents like that? Under what right? You are literally grand- PARENTS. The kids are 15 and 16 and can very well come and visit you and I'm sure in 2 years they will both run away from this father. NTA you have two grandchildren and that's it. Continue showing your love to your daughter's children!", "NTA.", "NTA. Those other kids aren't your grandkids and their own grandparents need to step in for them.

You should of course be polite and caring towards any child when you see them, but you should not feel pressured to buy them anything or spend time with them.", "NTA\n\nSounds like you are doing just what your daughter asked. I would be concerned for the other children too. Do your grandkids have a good relationship with the little ones? Could they help you in helping the other kids? Telling you when something is needed or just really wanted that the parents can't provide. Or just doing things for the other children through the grandkids.", "NTA. \n\nAll the children are innocent, and that doesn't make it your problem. \n\nHe and his wife decided to bring this many children in to the mix, and it is their responsibility to care for them. It doesn't sounds like they are in danger or not getting the basics, they just aren't getting all that your grandchildren are getting. That is life. \n\nAnd I am not being callous, because of course if you were blending the families and coming together I would tell you to include the other kids in holidays and all that (aka, treat them the same when they are all together), but your ex son in law is the reason none of that happened or will happen. \n\nHE tried to severe the relationship between you and your grandchildren, thus creating an adversarial relationship that remains very icy. That is fully on him, and the consequence of that is that you have zero relationship with the other kids- fine- and you certainly don't feel inclined to help him. \n\nI have a feeling your grandchildren will be living with you soon, and while it hasn't been easy, nor pretty, you are doing exactly as your daughter wished.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your so called rights as a grandparent won't hold much weight. Hell being a father still doesn't hold much weight. You can do whatever and you can take them to court.

I am so sorry that you are having to go through this but your grandkids are old enough now that I am sure they are aware of what is really going on.
