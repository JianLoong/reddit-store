Unfortunately you are handling it all wrong.\n\nAll wrong.\n\nYou seem more focused on your social embarrassment and lurid imaginings of what they might have done in the past than in thinking this through. You seem more interested in wielding what limited power you have like a sledgehammer rather than working with your husband to develop a unified and kind approach. \n\nYou realize that the person you may be icing out of the family is you, right?", "YTA. \n\nThey were teenagers when they met and now they\u2019re adults. If you hadn\u2019t married the boy\u2019s father he would have been no different than a high school and college boyfriend. It\u2019s totally normal and healthy for teenagers to individuate and test romantic love.\n\nI think you\u2019re projecting an idea onto them that they don\u2019t share about your family relationship. They aren\u2019t brother and sister and never will be.\n\nIf you fell in love with the boy\u2019s father it should be no surprise that your daughter would fall in love with the son. You all likely share similar value systems and that is something to be celebrated, not scorned.\n\nThe only advice these kids need is making sure they both understand that they will always be connected by family, even if they break up. As long as they can respect that, what harm can come?\n\nWhat you are doing will divide your family, and it won\u2019t stop them. It might cost you your marriage and relationship with your daughter.", "YTA. They're not biologically related, and as far as I can tell there wasn't a power imbalance, and they went to different colleges even. You're shocked, we get it. But stop letting that shock destroy your family relationships.", "YTA. Please explain your issues with it, and to say \u2018going too far\u2019 is insufficient. Otherwise, there are no issues. They have been together since they were 16. They are not genetically related (or are you keeping secrets?). They went to different colleges and each had a unique experience. They are good for each other. They support each other (clearly better than you do). Other than YOUR discomfort at the country club introducing your children, what is the issue?", "INFO what do you think going ballistic is going to achieve?", "YTA - my parents are legally step parents had a similar situation and while it\u2019s a little uncomfy. It\u2019s a great icebreaker when meeting people tbh. Because of the jokes that comes with it everyone loves to laugh. \n\nYou brought two people of age together and now you\u2019re mad about it? \n\nImagine how scared they were to tell you and all you did was prove them right.", "YTA\n\nThey are not siblings. They have no reason to feel like siblings to each other. You really are just alienating them for no good reason.", "YTA they didn\u2019t grow up together. You can\u2019t expect to marry and all the kids suddenly see each other as siblings.", "You did come off really harsh, however, I\u2019d be grossed out too as a parent. I definitely would not be thrilled about this.", "YTA. They are not siblings. They were pretty much set as people by the time they met. It's not really their fault their parents are married. You handled this situation very poorly.", "YTA\n\nI understand from your follow up comment that you are concerned if they break up you won\u2019t be able to do anything together as a family, but that ship has already sailed as they have already been a couple for a year. How do you think your freak out and kicking them out of the house is going to affect family time?", "YTA - They are not related. You chose to get married and they had to adapt to a blended family.  Stuff like this happens and now youve humiliated and ostracized your daughter for being honest. No one is forcing you to support it but if they are serious they are allowed to do what they want (being adults)\n\nYou seem to care more about your image than having your child at Christmas so thats why it comes across very assholy", "I think it\u2019s a gentle YTA.  I find the situation uncomfortable, but they didn\u2019t grow up together since childhood as they were both 16 when you married.  Not illegal, and no blood relation, but it still feels awkward and definitely people will talk.  I get where your mind is at, but you don\u2019t realize that you are doing more harm than good by taking this hard of a stance.  They\u2019re already together, so you aren\u2019t going to stop it, but are you really ready to lose your child over it?", "I saw another reddit post a long time ago where a couple were going to get married and then each of their divorced parents married each other after a whirlwind courtship (while their kids were engaged), the mother then screamed like a banshee saying not to get married because it was 'wrong' for step siblings to marry.\n\nMy thoughts then are surprisingly still the same here despite this being a far more blended family. Your kid and step kid are not related, they've been step siblings when they were at the height of their teens and only a few years from adulthood, I find it hard to believe they would have had strong sibling bonds to one another regardless of what you call them - they spent 6 years together like that, it's clear they basically saw each other to be more like housemates than family, and them dating is just the icing on the cake of that.\n\nYou're taking this way too far, again I repeat that they are not related, yes it's messy, but you treating them like they committed a disgusting sinful act is wrong too. If you had found out they were dating at 16 when you just got married, would you have reacted differently?\n\nI ask that you take a huge step back and just talk to the two of them, not put up this wall where they aren't welcome in your home like they're unclean. YTA for the way you reacted by the way.", "YTA they\u2019re not biologically related and didn\u2019t choose to live in the same house.  It\u2019s also not like they\u2019ve known each other since they were young kids, you said high school and that you were naive to have not seen what was going on, but it sounds like you\u2019re naive overall, what\u2019s kicking them out doing, pushing them together.  What\u2019s your real problem here, they\u2019re not related.", "YTA. They're not related. They're step siblings and we're practically adults when they met. At 16 there's absolutely no way they considered one another siblings. Ever.\n\nFor you to be nauseous is stupid. They're not siblings and likely developed fees as adults. You're a complete idiot to think you can control their relationships and have probably ended your relationship with your daughter and steer because you're being so ridiculous.", "YTA. They\u2019re not related. They are both adults. They are not brother & sister & they didn\u2019t grow up as brother & sister. Fracturing your family over a non-existent \u2018issue\u2019 is wrong.", "YTA. The first thing that came to your mind was how they got physical under your roof ? Seek help.", "All the YTA people here, what the fuck is wrong with you? That's so fucked up to date the child of your parents partner. Have some common sense/decency. NTA wtf", "Focus on helping them prepare for their future and stop worrying about how you look and your future.", "YTAH", "YTA. They are not biologically related and are both adults.

This control-freak meltdown you're having over it makes you look very much like the bad guy here, sorry to say.\n\nWhat if it had gone the other way around? If they started dating as teenagers, and you met your husband as single parents because of THEM and hit it off, and took a few years dating casually to see if it wasn't just a passing thing but something that lasted. How would you feel if your kids (still together as a couple) went scorched earth screaming about what the family would say and how it's sort of incest and all that? You wouldn't like that, would you?\n\nYou should admit you were wrong and apologize to both of them. If you still insist on barring them from family holidays, you need to accept that they'll be justified in going no-contact with you.", "Absolutely YTA. These two are not related by blood, so you feeling sickened by the idea was entirely on you. You should be happy that the two of them found love together, but instead you had a tantrum and decided to cut them out of your life. Your husband is absolutely right, and you\u2019ve got some hardcore groveling to do.", "I get you're not comfortable with this.

YTA and need to get some counseling to come to terms with this fast.", "Yta", "YTA. honestly both kids are probably way better off without you", "I've heard stories of parents getting married when their kids are dating. They are not related. Yes they lived together but sometimes a blended family doesn't work the way  you think. I am sure it's weird but it's not that serious.
