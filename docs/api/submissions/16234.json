It was a quick but solid jab at something you know she's sensitive about and afraid of. Laughing along with MIL.... Bad choice. \n\nGiven how sensitive your wife is to this topic, I suspect her mom has a history of taking shots at your wife's appearance. This is surprisingly common, actually: Mothers who attack their daughters for failing to live up to some kind of dress code or beauty standard, but dress up those criticisms as being \"helpful\" or \"just joking around,\" so that people won't call them out on their consistent (possibly constant) cruelty. I would be 0% surprised to learn that your wife's preference for dressing comfortably has been a hard-won battle for her, mentally, and that she still needs moral support in knowing that it's okay for her to dress for herself, and not for some crazy standard set by her mother. \n\nOn the other hand, I also suspect that you are not psychic. So, if she hasn't explained any of the psychology or history here to you, then... Well, another soft she's TA, because she's making her issues your problem without explaining what the issues are or what kind of support she needs. \n\nOn the *other* other hand, you are her husband.

So, I'm wondering how self-centered you are, that you have yet to notice exactly how deep your wife's insecurity goes in this area. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, you both suck a little. She's not doing a great job explaining it to you, maybe, but you're not doing a great job picking up on the parts that she clearly has explained, either. \n\nShe needs to understand that her insecurities are not, in fact, caused by how you dress, and that they're ultimately her own responsibility to manage. As her husband, though, you need to be sensitive to the fact that she does have these insecurities and supporting her through them. \n\nLike, for starters, shut people down when they use how good you look to insult your wife's appearance. Because that's \"the joke\" that her mom made. You look so good, she doesn't deserve to be your wife. You could've insisted that your wife is beautiful no matter what she wears, or even that nothing you wear could ever outshine her lovely face. Instead, you laughed.

Maybe OP's wife could look into those rather than insisting he dress down.", "I just want to point out that even if OP wore simple jeans and a Tshirt, his wife would still look like a slob next to him. So there's that.", "Maybe she expected more from you than a half-hearted, laughing defense when her mother rudely insulted her in your presence? My husband likes sweatpants when not working and if his mother called him a slob I would have dressed her down rather cuttingly. He doesn\u2019t deserve that from her and I wouldn\u2019t let her get away with that . . . like you did.\n\nStop being so self-absorbed that a compliment from your mother-in-law about your style of dress can distract you from the fact that she\u2019s being insulting and abusive toward the wife you love. Ffs, man.", "Op I just wanna give you my opinion on what i see from your post. Your MIL insulted and called your wife names. You laughed about it (implied agreement) and then said something (that to someone who now already feels like crap because her husband and mother are making fun of/ganging up on her) mocking her. \n\nDon't ever laugh at a statement that puts your spouse down, even if you think it's a joke.", "I live in the Netherlands and seriously, if people want to see me in anything different but jeans and a t-shirt (using a hoody as a coat) they might as well give up hopes now. \n\nSeriously sweatpants and a hoody is so much more comfortable. I run around in them all the time. The only reason I wear jeans when running errands is because of the lack of pockets in my sweat pants", "It just depends a lot on the company. Meetings with clients in my company means jeans + button down shirt. \n\nCasual is whatever you like - shorts, (band) t-shirt etc.", "where are you from? SLOBenia?", "...no? I said no assholes here, as in I don't believe either of them to be an asshole and I don't think OP needs to change how he dresses.", "She certainly didn't help.", "Or if one of her pregnancies has changed her body shape so that those are the only part of her wardrobe that still fits.  I've been losing weight and I'm very much in a not much fits stage at the moment.", "A lot of people seem to miss this part. Reading isn't everyone's cup of tea it seems \ud83d\ude02", "Top tip from a lady in a similar position: wear a dress! I can't coordinate an outfit to save my life, but I can throw on a tunic and BOOM! Dressed to impress! I buy bulk second hand business casual dresses on ebay, and donate the ones I don't like to the nearest charity shop. The best part is no horrible waistband digging into me, and I can eat a big lunch since there's plenty of tummy room!", "A bit of a tip: accessories helped a lot in making you look presentable, whatever your style is.\n\nI love basics shirts/t-shirts, tailored/good pants, and statement accessories for everyday office wear.", "Well, OP is also kind of TA, too, then, because he laughed along with it.\n\nHe took the coward's way out, and that is one thing that he can't dress up.", "Its also very easy as the work from home person to slide into rotating sets of pyjamas and sweat pants and hoodies round and round... I have more sets of pyjamas than anything else. I just got a non work from home job and I have had to purchase what I would like to call, grown up clothes.", "Covid accelerated it for sure. Why buy and wear nice clothes if you can't leave the house?", "Is this the US? I don't think that is common anywhere else.", "Trackies being tracksuit bottoms.

It's an attempt to soften the blow and move on from the subject.", "I\u2019m confused here? What does ETA mean in this context? Is there a new version that I\u2019m not up to date with?", "Yes. To the best of my knowledge, this isn't common in Europe. I did live in Canada briefly, but it's been roughly 20 years and I honestly don't recall if they tended toward this. Plus, I was a student at the time anyway.", "Her mother's comment was very pointed and clear. She may have *tried* to seem teasing but she was definitely cutting with her words.", "Oh, the MIL can still keep her thoughts to herself. Most of us learn to do that as kids. If she\u2019s super upset about the way her daughter dresses, she can come here on Reddit and vent about it.", "This would absolutely be the best way for ops wife to feel like she's dressed up a bit but also comfy. I do the same thing dramatic sleeves and wide leg pants but also elasticated this and that and comfortable material.", "I wore scrubs to work for 20 years. Nothing more casual than elastic waist pants and an untucked shirt as workwear", "The issue here is that OP\u2019s mother-in-law essentially called her daughter, OP\u2019s wife, a slob and he made a very half-hearted defense of her, laughing. I don\u2019t know the family dynamic here but if my mother-in-law called my spouse a slob and he didn\u2019t call her out on it for any reason, I absolutely would. I love him and he doesn\u2019t need that kind of insult from anyone, especially his own mother. Same for OP\u2019s wife. She might be letting her insecurities take hold of her. Or she might be mad he practically agreed with her insulting mother.\n\nI\u2019m the opposite of OP. I wear suits to work most days but the moment I get home that comes off and is replaced by t-shirts and shorts. But people should generally wear what they like. \n\nOP\u2019s style of dress is not the norm where I live and I\u2019m guessing that holds for where he lives too which is why his wife\u2019s reaction is to lash out at him.
