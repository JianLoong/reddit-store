He told her once or twice he doesn't like her food, and then went behind her back and ordered takeout. She's being ridiculous and if she won't drop it, it'd be a major dealbreaker for me to get into a fight every night cause I don't want to eat her food. But I see no abuse here where he can't safely tell her he refuses to eat her food", "True, I don't think OP and gf are compatible based on his language alone. All he needed was \"her cooking style is not to my taste\".", "Dump your girlfriend. You clearly don't like her. And good luck with your health later on in life. I work in a restaurant and the amount of oils, fats, and sugar used in restaurant food is going to cause you health problems later on in life.", ">I have suits for work that need to be dry cleaned, and everything else my gf does.\n\nHow are you not embarrassed?", "Oh, now your horrible girlfriend fucks up everything, not just cooking huh? She's bad at cooking and so dumb you're surprised she doesn't mess up laundry.", "I didn\u2019t think you were the AH\u2026 but now I do.", "Then you can solve this problem by gentle nudging her instead of going full nuclear by pretending to eat.\n\nI agree she is silly but you are too.", "Seasoning should be added before cooking, not afterwards. Totally different experience.", "Adding seasoning after cooking has nowhere near the same effect as adding it before. Also, the dude was just making an example.", "Don\u2019t you DARE add seasoning to a chef\u2019s perfectly prepared dish!! And I\u2019m kinda serious, some people are horribly offended that you want to add salt/pepper.", "I mean, yeah, I'm incapable of time travelling and adding seasoning to the dish during the cooking process.", "But if he doesn't know how to cook, how is he supposed to tell us the specifics beyond just \"it's bad/I don't like it\"", "A lot of people don't want to get into \"the true work and science involved in cooking,\" especially every day. 60-80 minutes is a long time. It'll still be good to eat after a 20 minute prep, even if more time invested would make it better.", "Why not? If he can afford it and is fine with it, who the fuck are you to tell him otherwise?", "What\u2019s stopping him from getting take out all the time?", "You aren't allowed to disagree to something unless you jump through the hoops I SAY you need to jump through!", "Bro, listen: I can complain is someone\u2019s drive makes me sick even if I cannot drive. And if I have money I can get an Uber or a Lyft. Your point makes no sense in this conversation, they\u2019re not short of money. You\u2019re hating someone just because probably has more money than you have.", "Why would I be? She want's to do that, if she didn't, I'd have someone else do it. I value my time too much to do it, she works from home and says she'd rather do it herself than have someone come in.", "Didn't say that, lol"]}
