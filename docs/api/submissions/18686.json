To have the skill set. \n\nI'm sorry if I was unclear. But until you have she skills to take care of yourself, you are not an adult in my opinion.", "Yeah but he rejects all of her meals. And doesn't cook himself. So at some point you start to wonder what you really think about a partner who will only ever consume takeout at home...", "i told her. we talked. she didn't lsiten", "But like\u2026 why does he have to eat her food if he doesn\u2019t want to?\nHe wants to spend his money buying take out\u2026 why should that matter??", "But he did, read the post. He brought it up a few times and gf insisted she's great. Also OP didn't ask her to cook, why she can't respect OP's taste but he should the gfs? Also, his money, if he can afford it he eats what he want.", "I make much more than her, easily enough to cover takeout daily. And I'm fit, so I think i can eat whatever the hell i want.", "My money, i think i can spend that any way I see fit, no?\n\nAnd it definitely depends on where you order, I also go out to restaurants a lot and many of them have high quality, fresh, healthy meals. Certainly healthier than my gf's poisonous concoctions lol", "We haven't been together that long. Most gatherings on my side will have catering and on her side im not always able to go since i work a lot", "My dad's new wife sprinkled cocoa powder on spaghetti pasta, put mustard into everything she could and every meal just tasted like vinegar... I can imagine she sucking that badly bcs of experience.", "I had a friend who\u2019s wife destroyed any meal she touched. It\u2019s absolutely possible.", "Yes, all the salt and fat in takeout/restaurant food can ruin your taste for \u201cnormal\u201d foods. I\u2018m not saying that\u2019s what\u2019s happening here. Possibly OP is just an AH.", "His complaint is literally that her food is bland\u2026 he doesn\u2018t say anywhere his takeout is bland.", "Okay you're making shit up now, where did I say any of that?", "Oh well yea, sure. Tastes like poison at least", "didn't say mush. just bad. i can't pinpoint what's wrong with it, its just completely off.\n\nnever had covid, and anyting made by someone other than her tastes fine", "Alright, I can follow a recipe. I can use a washing machine. But I still won't.", "I can answer the question bcs my husband is an extreamly picky eater. I accept and respect his taste and let him order if he doesnt like what I cook. I ask him to taste the dish and if he doesnt like it, no hard feelings. My son has SPD and also picky. I still love him.", "u're just missing the point", "like i said he should have maturely told her he didnt like it. hes a grown adult if this post is real he needs to be able to cook and not get take out every single meal. he handled it like a huge asshole lol. the fact he doesnt even TRY cooking himself but complains when she does is big asshole move", ">And I'm fit, so I think i can eat whatever the hell i want.\n\nI would be VERY interested to hear what your doctor says about your blood pressure, cholesterol, and sodium levels.", "You have a scewed view of what is healthy.\nBeing fit doesn't mean you eat whatever you want. You still have to eat healthy, everybody does. Nobody eats out daily and stays healthy.\n\nGood luck managing high cholesterol and blood sugar 10 years earlier than most people would", "Until you can't. Things change when you get older. YTA for criticizing without helping her. And if you don't cook, how do you know you would do better?", "Weight isn't the only potentially unhealthy outcome though. From cancer to high blood pressure to cholesterol to diabetes - plenty of health issues you can develop from eating unhealthily, even if you are \"fit. You certainly can eat whatever the hell you want, but it won't hurt you to consider whether you should.\n\nIt does sound to me from the post and your comments that you're a food snob at best. You mention that she has tasted the food and likes it, and that her friends also like the food she makes. It's only you that seems to have a problem, and you don't even properly define what's wrong with the food. It's all just expletives and disdain, so if that's how you provided \"feedback\" to your girlfriend it's no wonder nothing's changed in the cooking. There's no suggestions to go by.\n\nAt worst, it might be that you don't actually respect your girlfriend, and see her as an unworthy poor. She and her peasant friends can enjoy their peasant grub, while you go to \"kinda more high end places\".\n\nWherever you land on the scale there, it doesn't sound like your relationship is a happy one. You should work on it, or else look forward to getting back on tinder.", "Basically the only thing you know is restaurant food. Which is different from home cooked meals. Home cooked meals are usually lighter in salt and spices and fats, and also there is no fancy presentation like a restaurant. \n\nDid you not eat regular food growing up?", "If he said that I would get it! Or that she insists on rotating three dishes he doesn't like something specific about and won't swap out.\n\nIt's just the strange lack of specifics combined with the insistence that she ruins absolutely everything. I think that it's more likely that the OP is so used to punched up or processed restaurant flavours that he rejects homemade cooking, especially that he won't cook himself.", "You literally admitted to dumping the food and refusing it. Also the meals you said she makes - especially the roasts and stuff - take HOURS.", "You literally did say mush in your first response to me. Who else is cooking for you other than your partner and restaurants buddy???", "Wait, you also won\u2019t use a washing machine?", "You don\u2019t do your laundry, either?", "what point?", "He did. Read. The. Post. He told it maturely but she's in denial. Also lost of ppl don't cook nowadays, especially upper class ppl. OP can afford the luxury then it's his business just like what he eats.", "I mean sure he should know how to cook, he doesn\u2019t want to learn that\u2019s his own business, if he can afford takeouts good for him. Doesn\u2019t exactly make him an ah for not knowing basic life skills since he isn\u2019t solely relying on his gf to feed him. Plus he mentioned that he has told her and he doesn\u2019t like it, but she doesn\u2019t wanna change\nWhich again is also fine, but she can\u2019t be mad at him for not eating the food he doesn\u2019t like\nIf that\u2019s all they were eating and he was complaining without making any efforts to cook himself, sure he\u2019d be an ah. But like here it seems like a pretty small issue?", "Yea sure, show me your diet plan, love", "Of course i did, my mother was a great cook, but we also ate out a lot. Fine, home cooked meals might be a little worse than proffessionally cooked foods, but nowhere near what my gf makes.", "I dunno why ppl are insisting OP doesnt know what he speaks bcs he doesnt cook. My husband doesnt cook either and borderline addicted to McDonald's yet he loves my cooking (and I barely use salt/sugar) yet can tell if I messed a dish up. Not the why just that it didn't taste good. I know the why bcs I cook. \n\nOr just because I'm not a movies maker my opinion on a movie is invalid and I must be forced to watch trash movies or what? Gf just should let it go really and get over it.", "Sure, but I dont \"consistently choose food that is basically the exact same texture and taste every time you eat it\", nor do I \"refuse new foods\" or \"not even try them\" \n\nI love exploring food from different cultures or trying new things, if theyre done right. I've been to a hundred different restaurants and never order the basic dishes. And I do try my gf food, not every single time, but often enough. At the very least i did so she wouldn't catch on", "Stop overplaying how long a roast takes. 15-20 minutes TOPS to prep then you throw that shit in the oven and walk away. It\u2019s not hard.", "u are a literal adult u cant get away with takeout for every single meal", "that if u want to complain about ur gfs cooking without cooking URSELF = u being an asshole lmao do u get it now?", "How could tell her maturely if he can't give any specifics when people ask here? \"Your food is all poison\" is not exactly mature feedback", "Show me your blood work first", "Ypu realise your not supposed to argue your verdict it's one of the threads rules?", "They are not worse, they are different. And I suspect that hers might just be a different taste than you are used to.   I think its time you got a 2nd opinion from others.", "When he's asked about specifics he can't give any but at the same time everything is 100% bad. That's not what your husband does", "Yes, I can have my gf prepare meals for me every day, but if someone who has learned how to do it and gets paid to, then that's not okay."]}
