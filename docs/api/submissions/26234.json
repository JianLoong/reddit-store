My parents were wealthy and set up a trust for my sister and me. I can get access to it now, but my sister has to wait until she\u2019s 21. \n\nMy sister is going to a boarding school abroad, and I\u2019m working abroad. We are initially from a Southeast Asian country. Our family home is extremely huge and unoccupied as my parents have passed away. After discussing it with my sister, I decided I want to sell that house to help pay for her education. I don\u2019t want to use her trust money because I believe it was set aside for her future after her studies, just like my parents did for me. My parents paid for my education, housing, etc. \n\nSince I just started working recently, I can\u2019t fully support my sister financially. We have three more houses, and I\u2019ve decided to turn it into an Airbnb. The other 3 houses are just apartments and not as big as our main house. \n\nMy sister and I have no plan to return to our home country, so I don\u2019t see the reason for keeping the house. Yes, the house contains lots of memories, but managing it would put a dent in my pocket. \n\nMy parents lived more comfortably than their siblings, so they would always help them out. However, my relatives always took advantage of their kindness. They were incredibly mean to me and my sister growing up. So, I don\u2019t have a good relationship with them. \n\nMy mom had promised my cousin that she could have her engagement party at our place when she was young (like around 6/7?) we are desis, so the engagement party is going to be extravagant.\n\nThere is no written agreement about this, and my mom never once brought this up. My sister and I hate this cousin cause she used to bully us. My cousin freaked out when I said I would sell the house. She told me to wait for 7 more months before selling because she wanted to have her engagement party there. I refused and said for the 7 months, the house would be unoccupied, and I couldn\u2019t be bothered to manage it. She said she could move in with her family. I stood my ground and said no. \n\nEveryone on my mom's side is pissed because I\u2019m ruining my cousin's life. Also, since they can't afford to rent a hall, I\u2019m being the AH. My lawyer said I\u2019m in the clear here, and I don\u2019t owe her anything. My bf and sister are on my side.\n\nSome friends say I\u2019m the AH because it\u2019s legally right but morally wrong.

Omg!", "NTA, but who are these 'friends'?\n\nTell them to offer their homes up for your cousin's engagement.\n\nIt's not morally wrong at all. The house is yours. Even if you loved your cousin more and wouldn't have minded her using the house, you LOSE MONEY keeping the house for another 7 months just so she can have a party there. Besides - why 7 months? Is it because she is not actually engaged yet? So what happens when 'just 7 months' becomes 1.5 years?\n\n**Your only moral obligation is to your little sister and SHE is whose welfare you are safeguarding.**", "NTA. You owe these people absolutely nothing. They are manipulative and blood sucking entitled morons. \n\nTell them the last thing you want to do is \"ruin\" her life. Tell them you are going to sell the house no matter what, but understand that they will need to find alternate accommodations.  As soon as the house is sold, you want to be certain to give them money from the proceeds that is equal to all of the love they have shown you and your sister throughout the years.  They can use it for the engagement party, the wedding, towards a down payment on a house, or anything else.  \n\nThen, after the house is sold, give them $0.99.  Block them afterwards, and enjoy the rest of your lives.", "NTA here, but if you wanted to be kind, or extend an olive branch, you could offer to rent a hall instead.", "NTA- You owe her nothing and if she \"moved in\" you would never get her out.", "NTA. Get a realtor and get it on the market asap before they can start squatting", "NTA\n\nFirst of all, I\u2019m sorry for your loss. \n\nShe made an agreement with mom. Mom isn\u2019t there. You don\u2019t need to wait months to sell to fulfill a promise that you didn\u2019t make. She also has plenty of time to make alternate plans.", "NTA. You have no obligation to please your bully cousin who you don't even like to begin with.\n\nThis is her problem, let her figure out where to have the party but it has nothing to do with you or your property.\n\nFamily will try to guilt trip but just hold strong.", "NTA - your relatives are for harassing you.  You are under no obligation to let any of them use YOUR house (its yours and your sisters now - not your parents), especially if that relative is a bully.  \n\nSorry for your loss.  Look after yourself and your sister, you two are the most important people in this situation.", "Absolutely NTA\n\nYour mom made a verbal promise to a 6 year old. That shit's not binding in court\n\nAnd the cousin sounds like a giant AH bully. Wouldn't lose sleep over it", "NTA. A verbal promise your mom may have made in passing to a young girl are in no way binding to you.", "NTA- sell the house as planned.", "Not the ahole! You owe nothing and do what is right by you", "NTA.  Bullies don't need to win every time.  Besides, was there a witness to the promise?", "NTA.\n\nMy condolences for your loss. But you need to protect yourself, and protect your sister. Your parents are dead. You and your sister are now orphans - she's still a young child, and you're barely even an adult.\n\nI would strongly suggest making sure you have security on the properly like cameras and you check on them frequently -- I'd suggest seeing if you can get the house sold sooner rather than later. Your cousin's demands - including the mention of \"oh but our family can move in!\" I believe betrays what they really want: they want to take possession of the house. Whether that means they can try to weasel in and steal ownership or become squatters and a nightmare for you would depend on the laws of that country, but this is something you will want to be proactive and \"nip it in the bud,\" as the saying goes. \n\nSell the house, and save the money for you and your sister. You've both lost your parents and judging by how your family are treating you right now, I worry they would not be a good support system (if a support system at all!) should you ever need it for any reason. You may need this money to care for your sister... you may be able to invest in into her/both of yours future. Either way, this is the \"support\" your parents were able to pass down to both of you as they are no longer able to be here physically - do what you need to do. Protect both yourself and your sister.", "NTA\n\nYou're not ruining your cousin's life. It's not like her or your other relatives are paying for the cost of running the house", "NTA. \u201cYou were planning to have your engagement party here? Well, I was planning on my parents still being alive.\u201d \n\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if your cousin and other relatives invented that \u201cpromise\u201d anyways. Who knows what other \u201dpromises\u201d they might start claiming that they\u2019re owed next.", "NTA. \n\nDo not let your cousin move in or you will never get her out of there. \n\nSell the house. Live your life. \n\nIf your cousin were more reasonable and kind, I would suggest that you could give her some money from the sale to put toward her wedding, but as it is I think you should just sell and ignore all her protests. \n\nHaving you keep the house for another seven months is not a reasonable thing to ask. Nor is asking to move into the house.", "Tell your relatives the reason why you won\u2019t let your bully of a cousin use your house. You have no moral obligation to her. Let everyone know how awful your cousin treated you and your sister and sell the house now.", "NTA - We need to stop feeling obligated to be kind to \"family\" who were AH's to us!", "NTA, sell everything and buy a new family", "IF you let them move in you will never get  them out", " yea- Sorry you and your sis have lost your parents so young. You are doing an amazing job supporting your younger sibling and securing her future through a solid education and leaving her money alone.", "NTA. If you are ruining your cousins life by not allowing her to use your house, she has a pathetic life. They can host it at their own house or someone else\u2019s home, it doesn\u2019t have to be yours. If they have all that money for a huge engagement party, why can\u2019t they shell out some for a venue? They are just being selfish and cheap.stick to your guns!", "The those relatives to go fuck themselves. You don't owe them anything, not even the right to step a foot in that house.\n\nNTA.\n\nSeel that house when you wanted and live far away from that kind of people.", "NTA", "NTA your good hon", "NTA. They should have treated you better. It's their fault, not yours", "NTA \"ruining my cousin's life.\" so much drama over a party. I'm sure not having an engagement party at a particular house is going to destroy the rest of her life lol It's yours and your sisters. Do what you want with it and the rest of the family can take a hike", "NTA, if they can afford an extravagant party, they can afford to downscale for the amount it costs to rent a hall.", "NTA\n\nCousin should have been nicer to you growing up. \n\nOr, she and her family can buy the house and do what they want with it. Either way, not your problem.", "Not morally wrong. Dump those frenemies.", "And what if the cousins and family decide not to leave after the party? Then it's eviction time, which is expensive and drawn out, plus whatever damage they might do to the house. Plus whatever damage happened during the party--as things always get damaged during big parties, even fancy ones. If you let them move in, they will hate you a lot more when you have to throw them out, or you'll be supporting them forever.\n\nOP, as someone old enough to be your mom: Don't let them move in. Sell the house now. It's lovely that you're using the money to support your sister. And my condolences on your loss. May their memory be a blessing.", "My house\n\nMy rules\n\nMy coffee", "Have you been to an Indian wedding? Reasonable lifestyle isn\u2019t considered at all. It\u2019s all about showing off and showing up everyone else.  That\u2019s not the OP\u2019s circus or monkey though. The sooner the house is sold the better.", "Desi here as well. Very well said. Though I'm big on family, I don't trust the laws in our countries. Occupancy is 9/10 of the law.", "Don\u2019t pay for anything.  She doesn\u2019t deserve it.", "NO   NO    NO", "\"Ruining their life\" by... not giving them a free house.

Thank goodness THAT didn\u2019t happen. I\u2019d be allergic to myself", "Please do it soon because people can take advantage of terrible situations. Just tell them you have no money and need to take care of your little sister. Really pile on the guilt and shame - so that they feel bad.\n\nFamilies can be so bad. My great aunt had a maternity hospital Stolen by a sibling. Seriously. Especially you never know what the property laws are like depending on your country. Sell it.", "Someone who likes the rest of their family and doesn\u2019t want to have a hellish family forever.   \nYou don\u2019t HAVE to give money to someone you like. But sometimes it makes sense to go the path of lessor angst.   \nOP has lost her parents, and this could be enough friction to dissolve some other relationships. It\u2019s easy to say \u201cWell they are relationships she didn\u2019t need anyway\u201d but some nice and reasonable family members might turn away simply because they don\u2019t want to be int he drama of it all (particularly if others are very vitriolic / drama laden). By offering a token help out OP is showing a level headed reasonableness that puts family interests at a reasonable priority, while not losing her autonomy. I\u2019d stay in touch with a person like that around all the drama."]}
