My parents were wealthy and set up a trust for my sister and me. I can get access to it now, but my sister has to wait until she\u2019s 21. \n\nMy sister is going to a boarding school abroad, and I\u2019m working abroad. We are initially from a Southeast Asian country. Our family home is extremely huge and unoccupied as my parents have passed away. After discussing it with my sister, I decided I want to sell that house to help pay for her education. I don\u2019t want to use her trust money because I believe it was set aside for her future after her studies, just like my parents did for me. My parents paid for my education, housing, etc. \n\nSince I just started working recently, I can\u2019t fully support my sister financially. We have three more houses, and I\u2019ve decided to turn it into an Airbnb. The other 3 houses are just apartments and not as big as our main house. \n\nMy sister and I have no plan to return to our home country, so I don\u2019t see the reason for keeping the house. Yes, the house contains lots of memories, but managing it would put a dent in my pocket. \n\nMy parents lived more comfortably than their siblings, so they would always help them out. However, my relatives always took advantage of their kindness. They were incredibly mean to me and my sister growing up. So, I don\u2019t have a good relationship with them. \n\nMy mom had promised my cousin that she could have her engagement party at our place when she was young (like around 6/7?) we are desis, so the engagement party is going to be extravagant.\n\nThere is no written agreement about this, and my mom never once brought this up. My sister and I hate this cousin cause she used to bully us. My cousin freaked out when I said I would sell the house. She told me to wait for 7 more months before selling because she wanted to have her engagement party there. I refused and said for the 7 months, the house would be unoccupied, and I couldn\u2019t be bothered to manage it. She said she could move in with her family. I stood my ground and said no. \n\nEveryone on my mom's side is pissed because I\u2019m ruining my cousin's life. Also, since they can't afford to rent a hall, I\u2019m being the AH. My lawyer said I\u2019m in the clear here, and I don\u2019t owe her anything. My bf and sister are on my side.\n\nSome friends say I\u2019m the AH because it\u2019s legally right but morally wrong.

The \u2018promise\u2019 was made a long time ago in entirely different circumstances, if it was made at all. You do not owe her anything.", "NTA. They cannot afford a hall? Then postpone the engagement party, I see no concern of yours here. These are leeches, the cousin used to bully you, I think that she's acting way too entitled here. Block everyone that harasses you.\n\nPlus, can I add that your cousin is so effin delulu, seriously holding \"her promise\" when she was 6/7?!\n\nOn top of everything she is trying to occupy the house with her family, - oh hell nawwww!", "I would do the same thing as you. You have no obligation to let her use the house. Perhaps you should remind her of her bullying and let her know pay back is a batch. You don't want these leaches in your life anyways. Send her a small gift for her engagement (not money) and move in with your amazing future life.", "NTA can you transfer to title of the house to some LLC-type entity?  That way, you can say the house is now out of the family.", "Ruining her life? My god, the drama. Your extended family sound like a nightmare, who the f cares what these hysterics say about you?\n\nSell the house and block them.  NTA", "NTA \n\nSell it ASAP before they take advantage of it being empty and just go live there", "NTA. Your cousin sounds amazingly entitled. I know your sister is still quite young but you are in agreement it is nobody\u2019s business except yours,", "NTA where is the morale if you bully ppl and expect them to dingledangle around your needs? the audacity. sell the house, be done with family that doesnt care. period", "NTA and not your problem. Sell the home and move on. You are under no obligation to continue to subsidize your mothers family, and it seems they are continuing to bully you because they think they can get away with it due to your age.", "NTA. You let them occupy your house and she is capable of getting pregnant and using children as a weapon. You owe your cousin nothing, even morally. That family wants to take advantage of you like they did your parents.", "NTA. It was morally wrong of her to bully you  Tell her that if she had treated you kindly then you would help her. Also, it's your responsiblity to keep the properties in good order. If she damages anything you don't have as spare income to fix it.\n\nThe future is a long time, btw. You never know if you might decide to return. Can you rent the property out, appoint a good property manager? \n\n\nMake sure you get excellent king term financial and investment advice. You should be able   to live off rental from the various properties. Sorry svttiur osrebyr", "ruining her life... good one lol, nta\n\nThey are trying to move into the house and stay there permanently.", "Nta. If neither you nor your sister have plans to return home, there is no point keeping the house anymore. I am truly sorry for your loss. I wish you and your sister all the best and hope the two of you heal from your grief.", "NTA. It\u2019s not immoral if OP wants to sell the house. She has no moral obligation to lend the house to her cousin for her engagement party.", "NTA and no it isn't \"morally wrong\" do not let these people move into that house or you might have a difficult job getting them out again. Why would you do any kind of favour for someone who used to bully you anyway!", "It\u2019s your home and you decide! Your cousin caused her own consequences, and if they can\u2019t afford a hall for their party\u2026 then- they shouldn\u2019t be having the party. I would NEVER let them move in because you would NEVER get your home back! Her family would be backing their lies to the authorities if you ever let them stay there and you tried to get it back\u2026 don\u2019t even let them have a party there - because a lot of things would mysteriously disappear. Your NTA", "NTA. You and you sister are now your top priority. How your family can't support that is beyond my comprehension. Letting anyone form the family move in would be a disaster. They won't move out willingly. You'll still be paying for the hone and its upkeep. Sell it and move on the best you can.", "NTA - If they want the house to stay in the family, they can buy it.  Sounds like you have a ton of family, they could pool resources to set up a trust to buy the house for the family and manage it with the trust money.\n\nSorry for the loss of your parents at such a young age, and for making the choices needed to support your sister.", "NTA", "NTA. \n\nDO NOT let her move in. She will never leave and you'll be paying for her home.  Sell the house and stop sharing your financial and real estate plans with anyone.  She didn't need to know you were selling the house until it was sold.", "NTA your mom promised your cousin could use her house. It's not your mom's house anymore. It's yours. Life happened and the facts changed. The promise your mom made, died with her. There's no moral obligation to uphold it. Things might have been different, if the party was already set in stone and invites had gone out. But that doesn't seem the case. The fact that she bullied you only adds to the fact, that the morals are on your side.\nMy condolences to you for the loss of your parents.\nSell this house, support your sister and live a great life.", "NTA, no one can dictate your life or your possessions. You don't owe your cousin anything.", "NTA.  \n\nMake sure you have good security at the house so that she doesn't just show up and try to take up residence.", "If the cousin has their life ruined because of where a party is held then maybe cousin\u2019s life is just super easy to ruin and you don\u2019t have anything to do with it. \n\nThese people aren\u2019t family by any measure beyond blood, and blood is pretty insignificant when it comes to what family is supposed to be. \n\nNTA \n\nSell the house, live your life free of these assholes. See it as an escape", "NTA.  Your friends telling you are morally wrong are very much mistaken. Ask them if they want to throw a huge party for their childhood bully and let that bully just take a house. I say this because if you let them move in they will never leave. You have no obligation to do anything for anyone, een family. Especially so called family that has never treated you well.", "NTA - but you realise your cousin is lying, yes?\n\nYour mum \u201cnever once mentioned the promised party\u201d - because she didn\u2019t promise it. \n\nYour cousin is making it up. \n\nAnd the reason she\u2019s now talking about moving in is because you *explained* your \u201cno\u201d. \n\nThis is a useful life lesson. You don\u2019t need to explain your decisions to people like this - they will use your explanation or justification as a starting point to bargain with you. \n\nReduce your answers to: no, I am selling the house immediately \u201d. \n\nDon\u2019t give any other answers, just:\n\n- sorry, the party cannot be here, *I am selling the house immediately* \n\n- no you cannot move in, *I am selling the house immediately* \n\n- no, you cannot do (anything that would give me extra work in tidying or maintaining the house - like a party, or moving in, or anything else), *I am selling the house immediately* \n\nEtc.", "NTA.\nSell it.\nBe done with it as \"it's out of my hands now\"\nAlso I'm sorry but it doesn't ruin your cousins life. They can get over themselves.", "Offer to let them buy it before the house goes on the market. They might not realize the point you're trying to make about how big a financial commitment a house is, but at least you will have been fair.", "NTA - it's morally wrong to expect relatives to sacrifice time, money and effort they clearly do not want to donate, for the sake of a bully who's clearly never been repentant (and even if she was sorry, it's still to expect you to just give give give). Good luck!", "morally my ass, and since you don't even live in the same country, just block them and life goes on, NTA", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"My mom had promised my cousin that she could have her engagement party at our place when she was young (like around 6/7?) we are desis, so the engagement party is going to be extravagant. There is no written agreement about this, and my mom never once brought this up. \" ... That's probably due to the fact that it never happened.", "Nta you never committed to anything and you don't even know if your mom really did agree to that. You're certainly not \"ruining\" anyone's life.", "How is the desii engagement party going to be extravagant if they can't even afford a hall?\n\nNTA", "You may be TA in your cousin's eyes but I fully support your decision.  She is getting what she deserves.", "NTA  Sell the house and move on with your life!", "Sell ot ASAP and don't trust them.\n\nThey are lying because they want to claim the house which they will using as leverage their word against yours, fake non verbal agreements and a lawyer.\n\nThey ar buying time. Theu don't care about the wedding.\n\nThey just want to buy time.\n\nOmce a bully, always a bully.", "NTA.  Sell the house very soon. With the proceeds, tell the cousin you're willing to pay x amount directly to a venue and that's the end of it. Like a couple hundred dollars.  Apologize and say you're sorry your parents' deaths have affected her party plans, but it's out of anyone's control. And you & your sisters gift should be accepted gratefully from 2 orphans.  Turn it on her.", "Cut off communication with your family, they will suck you dry.  Sadly they have done nothing but use your parents over the years.  The buck stops here!\nTake care of yourself and your sister, my condolences to you both.", "NTA \nMeh just block them and move on, you don\u2019t need that toxic shit in your life.", "NTA - and be VERY careful and make sure they don\u2019t end up squatting in the house and/or break in to have their party and trash the place.

Even if your mother had put it in writing, it wouldn't be enforceable because the agreement died with your mother.\n\nI wouldn't even bother with making it an Airbnb. Just put it on the market. If your family can come up with your full asking price, your cousin can have her party. If not, she'll have to figure something else to do. \n\nMake sure you have a good security system in the house. With the level of entitlement they seem to have, they might just decide to move someone in.", "Your moral friends can sponsor the cousins wedding.  Candidly they are bad friends.", "NTA - and im not so sure you are morally wrong either.  You say there's no written agreement, and your mom never brought it up - so how do you know this was promised to them?", "Yup and it\u2019s usually a good idea not to mix family and money/business affairs. Especially when it can have nefarious consequences like trying to take ownership of the house.", "NTA. Don't buy into the melodramatic \"ruin my life\" BS that people here toss around so freely. Cousin was (is?) a bully, relatives are leeches, you know the score. I wanted to be a veterinarian & marry a rock star at the age your cousin was \"promised\" use of the house. Was not my lot in life, cousin will survive her own disappointment. \nList the property ASAP & move on with your life & your sister's plans. Yes, many of us do miss our childhood homes, but you've got great memories (& will only experience headaches or heartbreak hanging on to it from a distance & continuing to deal with grasping, greedy relatives).\nGood luck & much happiness to you & your sister.", "NTA, OP better find out what squatting rights are in her country because once they are in, it may be impossible to get them out.", "If they can't afford to save up money for 7 months to rent a hall to have their engagement party what makes you think they have money to upkeep the house for 7 months.", "Make sure you have a good security system in the house.", "Yes, exactly - it\u2019s not going to \u201cruin\u201d anyone\u2019s life.
