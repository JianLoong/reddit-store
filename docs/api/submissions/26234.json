My parents were wealthy and set up a trust for my sister and me. I can get access to it now, but my sister has to wait until she\u2019s 21. \n\nMy sister is going to a boarding school abroad, and I\u2019m working abroad. We are initially from a Southeast Asian country. Our family home is extremely huge and unoccupied as my parents have passed away. After discussing it with my sister, I decided I want to sell that house to help pay for her education. I don\u2019t want to use her trust money because I believe it was set aside for her future after her studies, just like my parents did for me. My parents paid for my education, housing, etc. \n\nSince I just started working recently, I can\u2019t fully support my sister financially. We have three more houses, and I\u2019ve decided to turn it into an Airbnb. The other 3 houses are just apartments and not as big as our main house. \n\nMy sister and I have no plan to return to our home country, so I don\u2019t see the reason for keeping the house. Yes, the house contains lots of memories, but managing it would put a dent in my pocket. \n\nMy parents lived more comfortably than their siblings, so they would always help them out. However, my relatives always took advantage of their kindness. They were incredibly mean to me and my sister growing up. So, I don\u2019t have a good relationship with them. \n\nMy mom had promised my cousin that she could have her engagement party at our place when she was young (like around 6/7?) we are desis, so the engagement party is going to be extravagant.\n\nThere is no written agreement about this, and my mom never once brought this up. My sister and I hate this cousin cause she used to bully us. My cousin freaked out when I said I would sell the house. She told me to wait for 7 more months before selling because she wanted to have her engagement party there. I refused and said for the 7 months, the house would be unoccupied, and I couldn\u2019t be bothered to manage it. She said she could move in with her family. I stood my ground and said no. \n\nEveryone on my mom's side is pissed because I\u2019m ruining my cousin's life. Also, since they can't afford to rent a hall, I\u2019m being the AH. My lawyer said I\u2019m in the clear here, and I don\u2019t owe her anything. My bf and sister are on my side.\n\nSome friends say I\u2019m the AH because it\u2019s legally right but morally wrong. My relatives are still harassing me.

I dont think its morally wrong also. Them wanting to move into your house for 7 months just so they can have the engagement party there is a huge red sign. Seems like they are trying to occupy your house and claiming it its theirs, or guilt tripping you in letting them stay there longer. Definitely stand your ground.", "NTA. Your house your rules. If your cousin can't afford to rent a hall for her engagement party, she need to reconsider her lifestyle  instead of feeling entitled from taking advantage of her aunt (your mom).", "NTA\n\nYou have good reasons for selling this house.\n\nAlso\n\n>She said she could move in with her family.\n\nHuge red flag, make sure they won't do something like this.", "NTA. It\u2019s your home, and since your relatives have taken advantage in the past, there\u2019s no telling how they would leave the house. Your cousin sounds like a spoilt brat and needs to learn you don\u2019t always get what you want.", "NTA. \n\nLawyer up, get buyers discreetly and sell the property before they decide to break in and become squatters. It will become difficult to move them then.\n\nShe was a bully. So doesn't deserve it.", "NTA. \n\nYou didn\u2019t promise your cousins anything. And your cousin was (and probably still is) a bully. \n\nYou don\u2019t owe her or anyone else in your family anything. \n\nYou sound like an awesome big sister. Block your family and go live your life.", "NTA: guess she shouldn\u2019t have been an asshole to you when you were young.  If you\u2019re feeling kind, offer to rent an engagement hall just for family politics. Or, more my style, keep it All and tell the shitty family to pound sand, or whatever the desi equivalent of that is (what is it btw?)", "NTA. Your mom made a promise she sadly couldn\u2019t keep. I\u2019m sorry that your relatives are\nhassling you. You sound like a great sister.", "NTA - stand your ground. You don\u2019t owe your mean cousin anything.", "I was on the verge here, but...  \n\n\n>Everyone on my mom's side is pissed because I\u2019m ruining my cousin's life\n\nlol pathetic much? How do you RUN HER LIFE by not letting her use your venue? she needs to get her shit together and throw her oh so precious engagement party herself.\n\nProbably smth along the lines of \"how humiliating\". Yeah, show off you own wealth, gold digger.\n\nDef NTA and I\u00b4m really sorry for your loss. You sound like a great big sister.", "NTA you have valid reasons for your decision.

Your parents left you and your sister everything to make you comfortable and secure.  As a parent, I'm pretty sure that keeping a large empty house for seven months so a cousin who bullied you terribly could have a large party there is not what they would have wanted.  In fact, you need the cash from the house in order to support your younger sister's education.\n\nYou are not morally wrong here.  Your extended family is being completely inconsiderate of two young bereaved sisters and don't seem to care what's best for you.  Please sell the house with zero guilt.  You owe your cousin nothing.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Not a bit. Selling your parents home seems to be the only reasonable thing to do. You can't afford to support the upkeep of it. It is not financially feasible to keep something that is going to drain your pockets, renting it opens a can of worms because you could end up with people who would. Your bully cousin can suck it up, it is not your job to provide anything for her wedding or other related activities. \n\nI am sorry for your loss. Grief is a deeply personal thing. Don't let anyone tell you how you should feel or  how quickly you should get over it. The first year is the hardest. Time heals all wounds. My husband lost his mom 2 years ago, he said its like losing a body part and learning how to live again without it.", "Nta.\nYou are not obligated in any way, shape, form, or manner to help them out.\nGo no contact with any of them that push the issue.\nThey will only create headaches.", "NTA  that\u2019s a HUGE ask.

Do you have a historically low interest rate on the house? Given how much property values have appreciated, it may be worth hiring a management company to rent out the house as a long-term rental so that you can keep it. If you can get by on that level of income. Sorry if this isn\u2019t even financially an option, but if it is, the house could be your crown jewel asset. \n\nEither way, you can\u2019t host her engagement party. As a retort to cousin, maybe a simple \u201csometimes it feels like my parents dying ruined my life too\u201d or \u201csometimes I feel like my parents dying ruined my life, but the human spirit is so resilient and I must go on for my sister\u2019s sake\u201d.
