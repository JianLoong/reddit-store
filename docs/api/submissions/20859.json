Being that you are playing audio books, not music with a bass that might carry further - the 'sound pollution' as those two termed it is unlikely to be any greater than if you were backpacking with a buddy and chatting to each other. \n\nThose two men were entitled to their opinion - they choose, one assumes, to leave behind all technology when backpacking, as is fine for them.   \nYou have a medical need for the white noise of a human voice speaking in a soft, regular cadence, in order to remind your brain that you are safe. It's a very valid thing that silence in a warzone equals Oh Fuck Adrenaline Time. This is no different to if you had a service dog trained to prevent/bring out out of PTSD episodes, and you took your dog backpacking with you - people might equally object to you doing that.\n\nSo carry on. You are finding a way to heal, and that is good.", "YTA, sorry, but you should be using headphones instead of a speaker. \n\nIf you can only hear it in your camp it's either too quiet to be understandable for you at the edges OR it's going to be heard elsewhere. Sound becomes unintelligible long before it stops being able to be heard.\n\nThere's also acoustics to consider, depending on the area it might carry 5' one way and 25' the other. Sound also tends to carry pretty far in nature simply because it's quieter.\n\nSince there is a simple personal solution, personal headphones, you're the asshole. If someone is near enough to complain about it, they had a right to.", "NTA\n\nAs a vet that has deployed I feel your pain.  White noise is refreshing to me as well, it drowns out the tinnitus as well as prevents my mind from \"wandering\".

It's irritating to hear someone wandering around with a speaker, especially if you're trying to watch the wildlife.

Yes, many if not most people find it very annoying to hear other people's music when they're out in nature.\n\nYou're clearly not considering the therapeutic needs of the people around you.

When trying to sleep or to help with tinnitus, brown noise might be helpful. I have problems falling asleep because my brain won't shut up, brown noise interrupts the conversation I don't want to be having with myself. It also would be less artificial conversation type sound as far as having to deal with entitled nonsense complaints.

From what I'm gathering the audio is only at talking levels, so is talking rude when you're camping ? All this man is doing is lightly hearing something to calm down his PTSD and everyone here thinks he's blasting dubstep or something. Do none of you have empathy ?", "YTA - there is never an excuse to use a Bluetooth speaker in a place where people deliberately go to get away from stuff like that.

They can move along instead of camping right next to you.", "Gentle YTA, OP, I can appreciate why you don't want to use earbuds or a headset, as they may block crucial background sounds you need to hear for your own safety. Eyeglasses with small speakers or behind the ear speakers (one ear might be enough) may allow you to listen to your audiobook and still hear the sounds from your environment.", "NTA, if your at a campsite for the night or the morning and there is no one like so close to you that it would be bothersome then I think your fine. Especially since your not blaring music or anything.\n\nIf your on the trails hiking then I think that would be different but at your campsite it's fine", "NTA. Even in public campgrounds people listen to music and such. If you're hiking then wear headphones but if you're chilling in camp then there's really no issue at all, they're just gatekeeping backpacking.", "This from the guy whose mommy served so he can call me a disgrace?", "NTA.

Bring Bluetooth ear buds for when you're around others or likely within earshot of others because, yes, backpacking is often an escape from all that. Many people *want* the quiet you're drowning out.", "NTA \n\nI thought it would be pretty standard for every campsite to have some music or sounds playing!\n\nWe always have music playing. It\u2019s never loud or obtrusive but the second we settle the music comes out. \n\nWho listens to headphones while camping? Honestly no way would I listen to headphones in the bush. Kinda dangerous", "NTA. If anything, it\u2019s impolite for others to set up camp within earshot of your site in the backcountry (unless sound REALLY carries in the area), so if anyone\u2019s close enough to hear a voice-level audiobook that\u2019s really on them. It\u2019d be a problem if you were blasting music, but listening to a book at a reasonable volume seems perfectly fine in a wilderness area.\n\nI\u2019d wager that the Y T A votes are mainly from people who commented before the update or haven\u2019t been in a proper wilderness area before. Other than people hiking through, there shouldn\u2019t be anyone around to hear you in the first place.", "NTA.  Your peace matters too and I\u2019m going to say that it matters even more because this is a health tool for you.

First and foremost thank you for your service. Second you are not bothering anyone with it because it\u2019s in your campsite and they just so happened to walk through the middle of it. Honestly I think half of these have no idea what happens when a soldier gets deployed and what they face. I come from a military family and my dad had PTSD really bad to where he would get nightmares if he watched some war movies. So to the people saying your an AH are any of you from a military family or joined the military if not then quit disrespecting him because he already said about the headphones and that these people walked through HIS campsite. Also why don\u2019t you guys do some research on what can happen when a soldier has PTSD because sometimes it\u2019s not a pretty site.", "NTA\n\nAlso, WTF is electronic pollution?", "NTA", "NTA - assuming the audio books aren't super vulgar and kept low, fuck them.", "Heres one for you social warriors.  Swap PTSD with tourettes syndrome.  Hypothetically, some person suffering tourettes goes camping because they are alone and dont feel the shame of being stared at in public.  Then someone comes along and get in their case about their outbursts.  \n\nHows it look in your eyes now?", "Firm NTA!\n\nit sounds like you are using it respectfully, the y. t. a. votes are being flogs. \n\nwhy does a strangers preference for complete silence trump your preference to play through your speaker?.  its not like you found their campsite, set up right next to them and started blasting music.", "NTA- who blasts an audio book? Nobody. I work in an office and usually will put on an audio book over music. No one has ever said anything. \nIf OP was using the Calm app to play ocean sounds while he sleeps, would that garner complaints?  \nIf I read the story right, the grumpy guys complained about the use of electronics, not the loudness of them. Also how close are these cabins/tents anyways? I don't think they are right next to each other, but I could be wrong about that.\nAs long as you are not playing anything excessively loud or beyond what would be considered a normal bedtime, 9pmish maybe? I think you should be fine.\nI would be way more inconvenienced by hearing sex noises or drunk people personally.", "NTA. Use your speaker as you like. They don't make the rules about who can and can't listen to music or how they choose to do it.", "Esh - you for apparently forgetting headphones are a thing. I'm going to guess your speaker is louder than you think since they literally had to move camp to avoid it. Them for being annoying about it.", "NAH\n\nBut I think if you continue to do this now that you know it is bothersome, you might become an AH. Doesn't sound like you are being obnoxious about it but sounds pollution is a real thing. You mentioned the earbuds you have died in rain and snow. There are weatherproof earbuds that survive in all sorts of conditions (even swimming!) that you should invest in. It should solve the problem!", "NTA. If you were playing music along your hike, I could see that being annoying. In fact I really hate when ppl do that. But a low volume audio book at your camp site is the same as having a conversation with a friend imo. \n\nIf the elk don\u2019t mind it I think the humans can get over it. The wilderness has plenty of room for everyone & if you\u2019re being considerate of how the sound travels and the ppl around you, who the hell cares?

The real assholes here are all the folks saying YTA. It's a fucking forest. If it was a public campground with sites side by side I'd maybe agree. But it's not. \n\nAlso the people saying shit like, \"you're in nature you should leave that stuff behind\", who are you to tell the guy how to camp and spend his time outdoors? Bringing electronics with you camping is a Forbidden faux pa now?\n\nNTA. You're not hurting anyone my guy. Enjoy the outdoors.", "Unpopular opinion but your NTA. If you have it low and the sound doesn't travel past your campsite there should be no issue. I've never had anyone complain when we have used ours while camping. We keep it low and you can barely hear it in our tent. If someone walking through your campsite doesn't want to hear it walk a little faster to get away from it. If it's loud enough to be heard past your site then you'd be the problem but if it's low people should mind their business and keep moving to where they are going. If they can hear it from their site then your definitely in the wrong.", "NTA. \n\nI hope you still *are* trying to wear earphones whenever possible.

But really, if the weather is nice you should use headphones.", "NTA\n\nif you were walking along side them and playing it loudly that\u2019d be different. Would the guys moan at a group of people chatting? I doubt it. A lot of people when camping play music and people even play guitar and sing so I don\u2019t get why everyone is saying y t a", "NTA! Backcountry camping is totally different than campgrounds. No one should be close to you long enough to be annoyed!", "NTA. \n\nThank you for your service!\n\nYou have as much right to be out in the woods as anyone else. It isn\u2019t a campground, and the outdoors is an awfully big place, people are welcome to move as far away from you as they need to have their own ideal camping environment.
