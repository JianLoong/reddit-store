Being that you are playing audio books, not music with a bass that might carry further - the 'sound pollution' as those two termed it is unlikely to be any greater than if you were backpacking with a buddy and chatting to each other. \n\nThose two men were entitled to their opinion - they choose, one assumes, to leave behind all technology when backpacking, as is fine for them.   \nYou have a medical need for the white noise of a human voice speaking in a soft, regular cadence, in order to remind your brain that you are safe. It's a very valid thing that silence in a warzone equals Oh Fuck Adrenaline Time.

It\u2019s never loud or obtrusive but the second we settle the music comes out. \n\nWho listens to headphones while camping? Honestly no way would I listen to headphones in the bush. Kinda dangerous", "NTA. If anything, it\u2019s impolite for others to set up camp within earshot of your site in the backcountry (unless sound REALLY carries in the area), so if anyone\u2019s close enough to hear a voice-level audiobook that\u2019s really on them.

First and foremost thank you for your service. Second you are not bothering anyone with it because it\u2019s in your campsite and they just so happened to walk through the middle of it. Honestly I think half of these have no idea what happens when a soldier gets deployed and what they face. I come from a military family and my dad had PTSD really bad to where he would get nightmares if he watched some war movies. So to the people saying your an AH are any of you from a military family or joined the military if not then quit disrespecting him because he already said about the headphones and that these people walked through HIS campsite.

Nobody. I work in an office and usually will put on an audio book over music. No one has ever said anything. \nIf OP was using the Calm app to play ocean sounds while he sleeps, would that garner complaints?  \nIf I read the story right, the grumpy guys complained about the use of electronics, not the loudness of them. Also how close are these cabins/tents anyways? I don't think they are right next to each other, but I could be wrong about that.\nAs long as you are not playing anything excessively loud or beyond what would be considered a normal bedtime, 9pmish maybe?

They don't make the rules about who can and can't listen to music or how they choose to do it.", "Esh - you for apparently forgetting headphones are a thing. I'm going to guess your speaker is louder than you think since they literally had to move camp to avoid it. Them for being annoying about it.", "NAH\n\nBut I think if you continue to do this now that you know it is bothersome, you might become an AH. Doesn't sound like you are being obnoxious about it but sounds pollution is a real thing. You mentioned the earbuds you have died in rain and snow. There are weatherproof earbuds that survive in all sorts of conditions (even swimming!) that you should invest in. It should solve the problem!", "NTA. If you were playing music along your hike, I could see that being annoying. In fact I really hate when ppl do that. But a low volume audio book at your camp site is the same as having a conversation with a friend imo. \n\nIf the elk don\u2019t mind it I think the humans can get over it. The wilderness has plenty of room for everyone & if you\u2019re being considerate of how the sound travels and the ppl around you, who the hell cares?

But it's not. \n\nAlso the people saying shit like, \"you're in nature you should leave that stuff behind\", who are you to tell the guy how to camp and spend his time outdoors? Bringing electronics with you camping is a Forbidden faux pa now?\n\nNTA. You're not hurting anyone my guy. Enjoy the outdoors.", "Unpopular opinion but your NTA. If you have it low and the sound doesn't travel past your campsite there should be no issue. I've never had anyone complain when we have used ours while camping. We keep it low and you can barely hear it in our tent. If someone walking through your campsite doesn't want to hear it walk a little faster to get away from it. If it's loud enough to be heard past your site then you'd be the problem but if it's low people should mind their business and keep moving to where they are going. If they can hear it from their site then your definitely in the wrong.", "NTA. \n\nI hope you still *are* trying to wear earphones whenever possible.

I also live in a very rural area, on the edge of the forest where there might not be bears, but there are wild boar and also French hunters, who are probably more dangerous - I'm not joking either, I've seen the statistics\n\nWhen you camp, whether bivouacing, in a tent, in a caravan, or even a campingcar (RV), whether you are wild camping deep in the woods and/or up the side of a mountain or whether you are staying on an managed site surrounded by other campers: your pitch, your campsite becomes your temporary home away from home, your small circle or rectangle of earth that you make comfortable and adapt to your needs.\n\nThe smaller and more secluded the site, the more intimate a place it becomes. \n\nThere's an etiquette when camping. You try not to let your day to day noise and your stuff escape the boundaries of your campsite - OP's speaker playing an audio book at a low volume seems to respect that.\n\nYou also respect the boundaries of others' campsites. You don't intrude on them but wait at the edge to get their attention if they're up and moving, for example. \n\nYou don't use other people's sites as shortcuts.\n\nThese two men were invading OP's private space, his temporary home away from home.\n\nThey chose to find something to complain about that day.\n\nI suspect that they were grumpy just because they met someone else who reminded them that they were not completely alone in nature.
