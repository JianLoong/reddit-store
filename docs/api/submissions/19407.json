We have been \u201cliving together\u201d, but really in name only. We share an address. He was working in a northern camp for really good money, but we both wanted him to come home so we could actually grow our relationship. Fast forward a few months, I found a position in our city for him \u2013 not his dream job, but in his line of work, with decent pay. \n\n\r  \nThe same week he came home to start the new job, I ended up in the hospital with double super-imposed pneumonia for nearly two weeks. I was incredibly sick; septic, fevered, hallucinating, etc. During my stay in the hospital, he got another job offer that pretty much was his dream job (and it turned out he really hated the job that he had just started)\u2013 but it was located over 1000 km away. I wasn\u2019t really up to trying to figure out what that would mean for us, but I had no choice, as they needed an answer ASAP. So, he took the job, moved there, and plans were put in place that I would sell my house and follow sometime this summer. He was gone and working at the Dream Job less than a week after I got out of the hospital. \n\n\r  \nIt's been three months now with him working there and me being here(with a couple of visits in between). I contacted a realtor, had some home repairs done, planned to list the house. But. As it gets closer and closer, I have been feeling miserable and sick about things. I have an incredibly great job where I\u2019ve been for 6 years. Great pay, great people, all around fantastic. I can afford my house, I can afford my lifestyle, and for the first time in my life, I feel safe, secure, and most importantly, independent. \n\n\r  \nThere\u2019s no guarantee of a job for me there, so I would be dependent on Mr. A. Selling my house here is the only way we could buy a house there \u2013 but Real Estate is very different there. The price of my nice little middle class house here would buy us a tiny \u201chandyman\u2019s special\u201d there. In addition, it\u2019s a small community, job opportunities aren\u2019t plentiful. \n\n\r  \nI find I just cannot turn my back on the stability and security I have here at home. AITA for saying that yes, I\u2019ll sell the house and move my life across the province \u2013 and then completely changing my mind?\n\nEDIT\nReddit, you are amazing. I came here expecting a severe judgment. \"Maybe NTA for your decision, but YTA for saying you would, and now you won't.\" \n\nThat's honestly what I expected. Instead, I feel like Reddit has put its arm around me and told me it's okay.  I absolutely cannot tell all of you how much this has meant to me. I wish I could reply to every single comment. \n\nThere have been other red flag which I have been ignoring, but am rethinking now. I've paid off his debts, to the tune of roughly 14K. He left before I was well enough to go back to work. He has no assets; basically a suitcase and a car (and his Marvel collectibles). I can't trust him with my dogs - he's not mean to them, but has no idea how to care for them. They were kennelled during most of my hospital stay, and  they came home two days before I did. But when I got home, their water bowl was completely dry  \n\nI got into this relationship too soon after my husband died. I know that now. I am naive. I know that too. Now I just need to figure out how to get out. \n\nThank you, Reddit.
