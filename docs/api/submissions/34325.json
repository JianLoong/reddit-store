Throughout the entire week I tried indiscreetly asking if my parents made any plans for my birthday so I could call off work and tell my friends when I'd be busy but they never brought the topic up. I even asked them outright if they had anything planned and if they didn't I'd be going out with my friends. They answered no. \n\nThe night before my birthday my friends surprised me over text with tickets to a movie I wanted to see, outdoor rock climbing, and a paid dinner at this new restaurant I've been wanting to visit for a while now, everything was paid for by them and obviously I was ecstatic! I managed to get a coworker to cover my shift last minute and the next morning after i got ready to leave I was bombarded by relatives the moment I walked downstairs. \n\nNow to be clear these were aunts, uncles, and friends of my parents who I never really talked to aside from pleasantries during family gatherings, I wasn't exactly close with any of them. They had food, cake, and presents in the kitchen, and my parents were at the center. I was super touched at all the work they must have gone through to get everyone here (and the food looked delicious) and I told them I would be back before sunset. Immediately my parents got annoyed and asked me where I was going, and I told them I had plans with friends. They asked if I was just saying that to get out of celebrating with family and I told them that since they never gave any indication that they had anything planned for my birthday my friends made plans themselves, plus everything was already paid for. I tried to reiterate that I would be back before it was too late but they started yelling at me, calling me selfish for ditching family for friends and that I was a jerk for disregarding all the work they put into my surprise party. I once again tried to tell them that I had no idea they were going to invite anyone over, and if they had told me beforehand I would have been able to plan accordingly, but they said that would have defeated the purpose of a surprise party. \n\nI had to leave since my friends were waiting and if we were late our reservations to the restaurant would be rebooked, all the while my parents were yelling while my relatives watched. By the time I got home (6 pm) my relatives were gone and all the food was put away. I asked my parents about it and my mom told me I'd get the presents next year if I decided not to be selfish and put my actual flesh and blood before some 'silly friends' \n\nAita?

When planning a surprise party, one of the most important planning elements is to make sure the surprisee doesn't have other plans. They shit the bed on that one, and instead of taking responsibility for the results of their shitty planning, they're blaming you.\n\nI mean, they didn't even involve your friends... That's the first step.", "NTA. This party wasn't for you, but for them. If they wanted a surprise party for you they would have invited your friends too... So, they boobed, relatives you don't know, no friends, no notice, and they moaned when you said you had made other plans. Then they cleared away all the food before you got back, at 6pm. Sorry OP, they are utterly at fault here, and just embarrassed that they got caught out.", "NTA you told them that if they hadn\u2019t planned anything you\u2019d be going out with friends and they said they hadn\u2019t planned anything so what did they expect", "NTA. Your parents totally missed the point of a surprise party. They are the ones who need to be more mature. When you tell people I need some advance notice so that I can arrange my work schedule, they need to realize you have commitments. They were so excited about their surprise party that they gave no thought to the actual person the party was about. What if you had come down to the surprise party and then had to leave and go to work? Your parents are a soft TA for making the party about them instead of you.", ">if they had told me beforehand I would have been able to plan accordingly, but they said that would have defeated the purpose of a surprise party. \n\nThey are correct. But I just attended a surprise birthday party for a 19yo, thrown by her parents, and guess who was in on it?\n\nHER GODDAMN FRIENDS.\n\nThe parents had her friends take her out to a few places she enjoyed, while they set everything up and the guests started arriving. Then she showed up at home later in the evening.\n\nNTA. \n\nI'm sure Reddit as a whole will offer a dismissive \"fuck your parents!\" take but...I feel a LITTLE bad for the thoughtful/thoughtless duo because mine would have totally done something like this (and I love them to death). But as long as you actually popped back into the party before the guests left I don't blame you in the last.\n\n**EDIT:** I'm also REALLY impressed that you're a 17yo boy who allows his parents to follow him on Reddit.", "NTA. Your parents could easily have done something to ensure that you wouldn't make other plans, but didn't. They didn't have the blow the surprise in order to do that. It's also really inappropriate for them to expect you to cancel the other plans you told them that you were going to make at the last second. That would have been the selfish thing.", "NTA \n\nYour parents threw a party and didn\u2019t invite your friends? Hardly seems fun for a 17 year old. Only thing is, I find it odd you didn\u2019t think to mention to your parents that you had a full day going on beforehand? I mean I definitely wasn\u2019t asking for permission to go places when I was your age, but I would mention plans to my mother in passing, especially things I was excited about.", "NTA\n\nYes a surprise party is supposed to be a surprise, but the assumption on the parents' part that OP would automatically be there. Also didn't OP mention having to change swifts with someone? So yeah, the parents dropped the ball quite a bit on this one.", "NTA because:\n\n>I even asked them outright if they had anything planned and if they didn't I'd be going out with my friends.  THEY ANSWERED NO.\n\nAt that point, if I were the parents, I would have mentioned we may have something planned, I wouldn't make any plans.  That's just enough info to give without ruining any surprises, and for you to know not to make any plans with friends.", "NTA. Surprise parties are one of those things that are better in concept than in practice, for the very reason you demonstrate. \n\nFirst of all, by keeping the person of honor in the dark, you run the risk of them having other plans. \n\nSecond, your parents made the party about them and making them feel good for throwing a party as opposed to doing something for the person having the birthday (you). Among other things, they invited people *they* liked, as opposed to people *you* liked. This was their party, not yours. And this was further proof by them punishing you about it when you got home. \n\nAnd there is nothing \u201csilly\u201d about your friends. You were not selfish - you parents were. They threw the party they wanted on your birthday - what you wanted did not factor into their thinking at all.", "NTA", "Um why weren't your friend invited to your surprise party?", "NTA. All they had to do was invent a different plan they were doing with you that day and then surprise you with the party. They could have said they were taking you out to lunch or whatever. It\u2019s a basic rule of surprise parties to make sure the person is available.", "Doesn't make sense that they didn't inform you about the surprise party. Very strange.  How did everyone but you know there was a surprise party for your own parents?  People were informed.\n\nSomething is off.", "Nta. They fucked up. Surprise parties are a thing of the past, imo. Everyone has too much going on for a surprise party to work. They knew you had plans. They just thought they could bully you into dropping them", "I'm going to go NAH.\n\nI've planned a surprise party once, and I've been to a couple.  They can be awesome. \n\nI get where you are coming from and why you left.\n\nBut, I won't lie, I'd be annoyed if I went to one and planned my day around it, then the guest of honor left and just expected me to wait around until they decided to come home.", "You NTA, but I do believe a lot of this could have been avoided. What would have been best on your end is to have your friends come in and cancel dinner. All parties involved probably would have been ok with this. You could have also told your parents the plan and maybe they would have been able to compromise themselves. It's a shitty situation all around since they did something so nice it what could be your last bday being together. Them reacting the way they did was AH but this is one of those hindsight is 20/20 situations where there isn't a solution", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That would have solved the whole thing.", "Your parents should have invited your friends to the party, and not just their friends.  That way, your friends wouldn't have made the plans.  Your parents blew it.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You were conscientious about trying to figure out if there were plans and even told your parents that you would be with friends if there were none. Your parents don't value your friendships, so they didn't even think to involve your friends and were offended/hurt that you chose them over your family.", "NTA. You made plans and were in the right not to break them. How could your parents be so dense as not to understand why you were asking about if they had anything planned for you?", "Right? Why would they not just say they had planned a family lunch, or whatever.", "Exactly this! You\u2019re 18 and then didn\u2019t even contact your friends to let them know they were planning a party for you much less, I don\u2019t know, invite your actual friends to your party! This party had nothing to do with you.", ">If they wanted a surprise party for you they would have invited your friends too\n\nThis, right here, is my first thought too.  This wasn't a party for OP, his parents used his birthday as an excuse to invite their relatives and friends over for a party.  Shame on them.  If it were actually a party for him, they would have contacted at least one friend to give them a heads up on the surprise, and to ask that person to invite OP's other friends.\n\nNo, OP, NTA and your parents are manipulative AHs.", "I was also confused about the work thing- like they didn't even claim to want to take OP out to dinner or something to make sure the time of the event was blocked off. What did they expect an 18yo to do? Be alone and go work a shift on their birthday? That's suppose party 101- have a fake event or otherwise ensure the time is not spoken for so this exact thing does not happen", "> EDIT: I'm also REALLY impressed that you're a 17yo boy who allows his parents to follow him on Reddit.\n\nExcellent point. 17yo me would have been kicked out of the house, if not exiled from the city entirely, if my parents had had access to my adolescent Reddit commentary.", "Not just cancel other plans, but change a work schedule as well.", "He said the plans with friends were only organised the night before and he managed to arrange someone to cover his shift last minute. So if his friends hadn\u2019t made plans he wouldn\u2019t have been able to stay for the family party anyway because he\u2019d be off to work? Parents messed up here on multiple levels.", "Because the party wasn\u2019t for OP, it was for the parents and their extended family with OP being just a reason to get them together.", "So usually when you throw a surprise party, you make sure the person you\u2019re throwing the party for is actually free for it. This is accomplished by someone who knows of the party \u201cbabysitting\u201d them and taking them on some adventure while the party is being set up. The parents did not do this, in fact, they did the opposite. \n\nOP asked them if they had any plans, they said no. OP then told them if they weren\u2019t doing anything, he was going to make plans with his friends.

Hell, OP didn't have that time off from work until his friends made plans.", "The parents are T A  in this case.   I'd say the rest of the guests at this party are completely blameless and if I were one of them I'd be annoyed.....at the parents.   Rule#1 of a surprise party is the Trojan horse person making sure that the recipient is the party shows up to the party and doesn't have competing plans.  Surely the parents could have found one of OP's friends to do this.   The cherry on top is that they put the gifts away and said that OP can get them next year if they do what they are told and act less independently.", "To be fair to OP and friends- hanging out with a bunch of people not their own age that OP barely speaks to vs hanging out with your close friend group doing activities you specifically enjoy... I know which one I'm taking. What kind of parents schedule a surprise party for an 18yo and don't invite a single person their age? That's just weird. Don't get me wrong, I am all for celebrating with family and having the aunts and uncles over- but at least for me growing up that was a known yearly thing. I go to my cousins Bday party the weekend close to their born on date, they all come to mine. A surprise party should be your close friends and family you see regularly.

Nope. The parents just completely excluded the friends.", "Right? I see no mention of even cousins getting invited. What kind of parent sets up a party without a single person near the age of the birthday boy?

All my life you told me you were my parents and never my friends. why tf are you trying to change the narrative now?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nanyway NTA.", "NTA,\n\nThis party was an ego trip for your parents to show how \"good\" they are as parents. But considering that they lied when you asked if they had anything planned and didn't even invite your actual friends, it all rings hollow. Being immediately spiteful afterward by withholding other people's gifts seals any chance of this being an act of kindness away.", "NTA\n\nMy mom planned a surprise dinner for my dad one year. The surprise was she got a bunch of his siblings to come too. He knew we were going out to dinner.\n\nHis eyes lighting up seeing his siblings at the table is still one of my favorite things.\n\nMy mom threw me a surprise party when I was 16. She planned it with my best friends. I can\u2019t imagine her not inviting them.", "NTA. Surprise parties are totally stupid for this exact reason, and parents who lean into the surprise gag, even when you've explicitly told them not to do that, are the real AH's. \n\nIt's incredibly awkward and you have my sympathies. But obviously someone's plans in the schedule conflict were going to be broken, and you keeping with what you'd said in advance marks you as a young man who keeps his word. \n\nAs you transition to being an adult with possibly chaotic parents, this is a lesson you may need to deliver to them multiple times going forward. This was the first step, and good for you.", "Your parents probably know they messed up but are embarrassed that the whole family know they didn't communicate effectively (and who throws a surprise party without having a fake appointment/activity for the guest of honour? - that's just sensible \n\nPlus the party sounds like it was more for them than you.\n\nNTA", "NTA you told your patents if they didn't have plans you would make them with your friends and you did. after your friends made such elaborate plans it would have been rude to tell them 'no'", "You specifically told them that you would make plans with friends for your birthday.

First rule of a surprise party... make sure the person being surprised can actually make it!!! They didn't invite any of your friends which would be normal at a birthday party. They screwed up and blamed you for it. Quite frankly I'd stick with your \"silly friends\" next year too.", "NTA you\u2019re an adult now you\u2019re supposed to be spending birthday parties with friends. \n\nText your relatives individually thank them for showing up, you really couldn\u2019t bail on your friends who had planned and paid for something because no one had any idea your parents actually cared about your birthday. You wished everyone had been able to stay later or the party was communicated so you could\u2019ve visited.   Also say you have no idea what to do about thank you notes since your parents seemed to have kept the gifts for themselves or gave them back and aren\u2019t communicating. You didn\u2019t want them to think you were being rude.", "Surprise parties are the worse for just this reason.  NTA.  If you were just going to go hang out at a friend's house and play video games, maybe, but your friends made reservations, spent money that can't be recovered, and you specifically asked your parents if anything was planned.\n\nI'm sorry they're being pissy about this.", "be like on next year i just wont come. i asked and asked and asked and you said no. thats on them not you. cuddos to your friends.", "Yepp, came here to say this. This was all for a show. \n\nI'm sure OP is torn but he said *multiple times* that if the parents had no plans he will go out. And so he did. He promised and made this very clear in advance. I hate those parents on behalf of OP :D", "Based on how the parents come off in this story, I have a feeling OP doesn\u2019t have a choice about if they follow him\u2026", ">I feel a LITTLE bad for the thoughtful/thoughtless duo because mine would have totally done something like this (and I love them to death). \n\nI have a theory about what might be going on.  Parents of children this age have been watching their child slowly slip away for some time, as their friends have become their priority.  Now, although they're likely still financially dependent on them, the children are legal adults.  Soon they'll be losing them to a partner too.  Even when they come back to some extent as they begin their own families, it won't be the same.  The parents might be feeling vulnerable and trying to capture the time when they and their relatives were their children's priorities and center just one more time.\n\nThey're not getting that the moment is already gone.  Once they're a certain age, you're going to lose against the strong pull of friends and then possibly a life partner.  Emotionally anyway, even if you use financial leverage.", ">Why would they not just say they had planned a family lunch, or whatever.\n\nAnd give up the control they have over their child?\n\nI have a feeling these are \"my way or the highway\" types, and in that case, the child does not need to know about decisions because he is just a child with no agency of their own. \n\nGood luck OP NTA", "This would have been the best solution. \"why yes dear, we've ordered something special for dinner and we'll need you home between \\*this time\\* and \\*that time\\*\"", "I think the usual technique is to have someone \"in the know\" make plans with the surprise-ee, and then guide them to the place of the surprise.  If you don't make *some* kind of arrangement, you're basically asking for what happened in the OP.  People like to celebrate their birthdays, and if you pretend you're doing nothing them, they will make their own plans."]}
