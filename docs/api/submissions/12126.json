My boys are now 12 and 9. Once a year me and the boys go to my families vacation home with the entire family and up until this year, my fiance did not attend. But now that we are engaged and merging families, the family asked that he come too (they all get along great with him anyways). I explained to him prior to us coming to our family retreat that during our week stay with the family, my kids do not have a bedtime. We do a lot of night activities, such as night swimming in the pool, karaoke, fires, nightly strolls through the neighborhood, etc etc. So during this week, my kids absolutely do not have a bedtime and this is how it has always been. I made it clear that bedtime was not to be enforced like it was at home because this is vacation and time with family and I'm not making my kids miss out on the nightly activities. I also explained that due to this, some nights they are up until easily 11-midnight. It's once a year, it's no big deal. So he was fully aware and please note that this is the only time I've seen this side of him that I will mention below.\n\nWe get here the first night and you can tell he is already uncomfortable with the boys staying up past their bedtime. He was stressing out because the boys were still in the pool at 10pm and he felt they should be in bed already. I reminded him at least twice that we were not enforcing a bedtime here and he let it go the first night. The second night 9pm rolls around and the boys were still up and my fiance was dropping comments like \"you're lucky you're even still awake right now, you should be in bed\". Saying it right in front of my mom, who looked mortified that he had such an attitude. I told him to cut the fucking shit, in private. He tells me he thinks it's fucked up and that it's going to be terrible trying to get them back on their schedule (never been an issue in the years prior). I stood firm and told him to knock it off and let it go. \n\nBut then last night my fiance starts angry sighing every single time he looks at my kids still awake and I finally pulled him aside and told him he was a fucking embarrassment because he keeps saying these comments in front of my family, which leads to awkward silences and judgemental glances my way. I warned him prior to coming here and if he had an issue that he can't control for a week than he needs to leave because he's ruining our trip with his passive aggressive BS surrounding a bedtime. He told me I'm an AH for making him feel like garbage over wanting to keep the kids on a schedule because it's \"best for them\".

Get out. You have a responsibility as a mom to put your boys first, to have their back, and to not let anybody abuse them. This will escalate as soon as you're married.

I don't think it's to do with genuine concern for sleep cycles (because the event is once a year, and it's their holidays). I suspect it's about control and/or he likes the kids out of the way for adult time. \n\nMy Dad used to moan when I was in the lounge watching TV quietly when I was 13 (I had no TV in the bedroom - I'm old!) and he would drop comments of \"you need to go to bed!\" \"why are you still up?\" \"it's really late!!\" when I was sat still, engrossed in the programme. He just wanted me out of the way so he could spent time with mum. He didn't care about my sleep cycle, he just wanted me out the room full stop. I wasn't doing anything. In fact, I was deliberately trying NOT to draw attention to myself because he would be harassing me to go to bed, when I just wanted to watch TV. \n\nI think you need to seriously think about how he views time with your kids. They may have a bedtime now at their age, but as they get older - that bedtime will get later and later. If the real reason is, he wants the kids out of the way, how will he deal with the fact that as they get older they will take over more of the house. They will be up as late as the adults, have friends over etc. Would he be able to handle that if he secretly wants them to just buggar off to bed and be quiet.", "NTA. \n\nYou told him that bedtime doesn't exist on vacation, and now he's mad because.... you told him the truth?

But might explain it.\n\nI am going to suggest sitting down, a few times, with him, and getting to know about HIS childhood.  I read your comments.  Did his Dad rule the house? Did his Mom embarrass him by dressing inappropriately, therefore making him sensitive to your sports bra?   Did he find his parents controlling? Did they stick to schedules?  Explore how he thinks a household should run. Don't debate him - yet.  You need to find out first, so don't argue with him until he has expressed himself.\n\nAnd the thing about bedtime ... Is it ONLY after the kids go to bed that he gets your complete and undivided attention?  He may not know it, but this was a thing even when raising kids with their father, for their whole life.

That's what makes vacation fun and I loved staying up by a campfire as a kid listening to adults made me feel included and loved. \n\nAlso, a slip of what really goes on in the relationship was towards the end where she says\n\n \"I warned him prior to coming here and if he had an issue that he can't control for a week than he needs to leave\"\n\nThis combined with the overexplaining of bedtime means that she is desperately trying to manage his emotions and mitigate his control issues. she may not have known what he would try to control or manipulate but she knew it would be something.", "Yep, saw them. Yikes. Feel bad for those kiddos.", "This\ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udffb", ">You are severely underreacting here.\n\nThat captures this perfectly!", "I was thinking the same. I can\u2019t imagine having to talk to him multiple times about it unless she expected it to be an issue. I dated my husband as a single parent for 6 years before we got married. Something like \u201cwe don\u2019t adhere to bedtimes during vacation\u201d wouldn\u2019t even be a topic prior to going. I can\u2019t even see him feeling the need to comment on my child\u2019s bedtime during a vacation and we DID take multiple trips with my family and she was often up later than normal.", "she said she pulled him aside, so how exactly is that \"**always** belittl(ing) him in public\"?

At the time of my comment OP had only replied to someone once and they talked about something else.\n\nThat does change things.", "OP said that they have a full-time father that they spend time with. And stepdad was not interested in taking a full-time father role. So no, if he doesn't want to be a full-time father, he does not get to have a say in the children's everyday routines, behaviors or discipline. That needs to go through their mother and their biological father, who is absolutely still in the picture.", "Oh yeah I agree he's got no leg to stand on here, and should not be expressing his concerns other than with her, in private. He is damaging all of his relationships here.", "Traditionalists,  they are usually some flavor of religious. They like things the way they were in their holy books. But usually they ignore half of the holy book and just implement the controlling parts. I just changed the term from Trad-wife, to Trad-man.", "Traditional. It's become popular when denoting to relationships heavily influenced by christian fundamentalism.

She tried again, it failed. \n\nSome people just need to be told they are fuckups and to cut the shit.", "Nah I'm good. I have a serious allergy to bullshit.", "She tried that a few times and he still was being a fucking embarrassment so that's what he gets called.", "Oh, so basically in the beginning of the relationship I made boundaries clear on the aspect of discipline, reprimanding, etc. My kids have a full time father figure in their life (their bio dad takes them week on, week off). I told him that if he had any problems and/or concerns that he was to come to me directly and we would find a way to work through it together for the most comfortability because I was 100% not comfortable with him setting ground rules on situations that I hadn't been informed about. He was completely okay with this. He very bluntly said from day one that he was not trying to be the boys father and generally speaking he is very good with communicating to me if he has a problem with something. However, I've noticed a lot of conflicting opinions on his parenting versus mine in the past. Such as he pushes modesty to the highest degree possible and had issues with me walking around in a sports bra, which I did shoot down. My boys aren't looking at me like that and it's weird that he would think such things. Or the fact that he feels the boys should have to ask permission to eat the snacks that I purchased for them. I don't agree with that either and there really was no compromise made there because he absolutely hates that the boys have an open door policy on my fridge. He also hates that I allow them to have drinks right before bed because then they are up using the bathroom. So now that I mention it.. there have been a lot of issues that I have kind of overlooked in the past and turned a blind eye too. But usually he does pull me aside and bring up the issues in private whereas while we have been here he is just pushing his passive aggressiveness off in public.", "He should feel like he's a father figure with no say in how the kids are raised because that's what he is. He's a step parent. That's what you sign up for", "The children have a father - their bio father is involved in their lives.", "Yikes", "I was thinking this too. She already knew in her heart he was going to be a stickler for bedtime even though they were on vacation. Make you question how much he is pushing it at home. He is probably the type that he doesn't want to see these kids after 8PM.", "Yeah this is very clearly about control and has nothing to do with him wanting to parent these kids.", "Oh. Ugh.", "I have not heard that awful phrase before. \n\nDouble ugh", "That doesn't apply. There are many ways to solve a disagreement over parenting. And arguably, I can't think of one time that name calling was a viable solution.", "She said where her reactions came from. I didn't assume anything", "I don't think this dude respects you. You might want to reconsider this relationship and protect your kids from this guy", "This is very controlling behavior. Your boyfriend has issues with you allowing your children to decide when they are hungry or thirsty?! What???", "One thing that's kinda striking about your story is how long you apparently spent explaining this to him. Like, my expected range would be between saying on the day before, \"By the way, we don't really enforce bedtime during the trip, cause fun stuff,\" and, at literally 7PM the first night, \"Lol yeah we don't do that here cause it's a vacation. Sry for not warning you but it's not a big deal.\"\n\nPoint being, the vibe is that you kinda seemed to expect this reaction? Not necessarily in this form and magnitude, but you were planning on him making a huge deal about this for no reason, you did your damnedest to tiptoe around his feelings, and the attempt failed utterly because there was no actual escape from him being an asshole. It high key sucks, is the message. He says you made him feel like garbage, but it's worth asking yourself the extent to which this dynamic makes you feel like garbage. Cause it'd make me feel like garbage.", "This will escalate when you marry. He will feel that he deserves to now be a father figure and control what happens in \"his home\".

Your son's deserve better.", "Those are all very controlling parental behaviors. That is concerning. Do his controlling tendencies also affect his behavior towards you?", "Please listen to the people warning about red flags. Your op was concerning that he kept up about bedtime on vacation. What you said here leads me to believe you are headed for major problems over parenting if you marry.", "Okay OP, so it seems like you two have a lot of differences when it comes to raising children. And you unfortunately just didn't notice how large those differences are, it seems. If this man is being this controlling about his stepchildren, I would be very wary about continuing any other type of relationship with him. If he's pushing weird modesty and over controlling parenting on you, this can't be the first time. You're saying it seemed to come to a head when he was with your family and in a public setting with your children. This is a power  and control move. He's posturing, and it's gross. I'm wondering if he came from a Christian Fundamentalist background? Or some other type of fundamentalist or Orthodox religion.\n\n NTA. Run from this man or set even more boundaries regarding yours and your children's autonomy. If he does actually care about you he'll listen without complaint. Otherwise a lot of this sounds like he was playing a long con for control.", "OP, I have been the child in your boys position, and he was absolutely fine until the day my mother and he bought a house together.

Good luck!\n\n\nNTA", "NTA - To add what others have said, your fianc\u00e9e sounds like he doesn\u2019t like your kids that much. Does he subscribe to the belief that children should be seen and not heard?", "Remind him to stay in his lane or he can take the exit ramp.", "Please think twice about it. Your sons are YOUR responsability, not his. And that will never change: they are too old to accept him as a second dad, even more because they already have one - AND because I doubt your fiance loves them like his owns. Your fiance is being a pain in the ass for your sons, with no reason. You would not tolerate from ANYONE to dictate what your sons drink before bed time, right? You would be mad if you learned that the new wife of their father would dictate such things (I would with my children). So again, think twice about it. In a couple of years they could very well decide to stay full time by the father to avoid your partner - as a mother it would hurt me very very much to not see my children anymore.\n\nAt least, please take time and don't marry too soon. And explain you fiance very clearly - like you did here - that his behavior will not be tolerated.", "Don't marry this man. It's gonna be too much work  maintaining boundaries with him and his strategy is to burn you out until he gets his way. And his issue with the fridge? I WISH he would've tried that shit with me.

It's fine for him to come to you and say (once) \"hey, wouldn't it be better for the kids if ___?\" But... they are your kids. And their bio dad's. If you say no, that should be the end of it.\n\nHe's trying to control your parenting.\n\n> had issues with me walking around in a sports bra\n\nHe's trying to control you.\n\nAnd the fact that he's willing to do these things publicly now, when he never has before doesn't indicate a change in *him*. It indicates that he believes there's a change in *you*.\n\nHe can be more forceful with his opinions now because you're in too deep to leave him. That's why he was invited on the trip this time, right? Cause you're basically married, you're trapped and he can let his flag fly now. \n\nHe's also setting the rules with your family. Letting them know that you're his wife and these are his kids and *he* gets to set/change the rules.\n\n\"Passive aggressive\" is still aggressive.\n\nThis isn't a behavior that is going to improve or go away. It will only get worse. *Especially* after you get married. He'll have more ammo at that point because he gets a fancy new \"stepfather\" title, and it's harder for you to end the relationship.\n\nRight now, this is your moment. You've seen his true colors. You get to decide for your children. Is this man going to control your half of their future? Are they going to be watching the two of you argue every time he wants to assert dominance?\n\nEDIT: PS: Absolutely children should have water before bed. Everyone should.

On top of him obviously trying to assert control over you in front of your family (\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9) why does he care about these things at all? This is just\u2026 normal behavior for children. Why does he care if the kids are up at night using the bathroom? Why does he care if they don\u2019t have a bedtime one week out of the year? I don\u2019t think I knew ANYONE growing up who didn\u2019t have open fridge policy for snacks or who had to adhere to bedtimes on vacation.
