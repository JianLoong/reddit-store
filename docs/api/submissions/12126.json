My boys are now 12 and 9. Once a year me and the boys go to my families vacation home with the entire family and up until this year, my fiance did not attend. But now that we are engaged and merging families, the family asked that he come too (they all get along great with him anyways). I explained to him prior to us coming to our family retreat that during our week stay with the family, my kids do not have a bedtime. We do a lot of night activities, such as night swimming in the pool, karaoke, fires, nightly strolls through the neighborhood, etc etc. So during this week, my kids absolutely do not have a bedtime and this is how it has always been. I made it clear that bedtime was not to be enforced like it was at home because this is vacation and time with family and I'm not making my kids miss out on the nightly activities. I also explained that due to this, some nights they are up until easily 11-midnight. It's once a year, it's no big deal. So he was fully aware and please note that this is the only time I've seen this side of him that I will mention below.\n\nWe get here the first night and you can tell he is already uncomfortable with the boys staying up past their bedtime. He was stressing out because the boys were still in the pool at 10pm and he felt they should be in bed already. I reminded him at least twice that we were not enforcing a bedtime here and he let it go the first night. The second night 9pm rolls around and the boys were still up and my fiance was dropping comments like \"you're lucky you're even still awake right now, you should be in bed\". Saying it right in front of my mom, who looked mortified that he had such an attitude. I told him to cut the fucking shit, in private. He tells me he thinks it's fucked up and that it's going to be terrible trying to get them back on their schedule (never been an issue in the years prior). I stood firm and told him to knock it off and let it go. \n\nBut then last night my fiance starts angry sighing every single time he looks at my kids still awake and I finally pulled him aside and told him he was a fucking embarrassment because he keeps saying these comments in front of my family, which leads to awkward silences and judgemental glances my way. I warned him prior to coming here and if he had an issue that he can't control for a week than he needs to leave because he's ruining our trip with his passive aggressive BS surrounding a bedtime. He told me I'm an AH for making him feel like garbage over wanting to keep the kids on a schedule because it's \"best for them\".

Stepdad never screamed or fought in front of us, but oh, the \"conversations\" they would have in the bedroom when we didn't behave exactly as he demanded (adhering to bedtime as a college student, leaving shoes in den or dish in sink, basically any type of indication that we lived in the house when he didn't want us around) and the silent treatment that would ensue if we didn't meet his standards after the conversations. Get out. You have a responsibility as a mom to put your boys first, to have their back, and to not let anybody abuse them. This will escalate as soon as you're married. If you don't, you'll be in the exact situation my mom is now - I don't speak to her because she never, ever had my back and put me in the fire line to save her relationships, both times.

I don't think it's to do with genuine concern for sleep cycles (because the event is once a year, and it's their holidays). I suspect it's about control and/or he likes the kids out of the way for adult time. \n\nMy Dad used to moan when I was in the lounge watching TV quietly when I was 13 (I had no TV in the bedroom - I'm old!) and he would drop comments of \"you need to go to bed!\" \"why are you still up?\" \"it's really late!!\" when I was sat still, engrossed in the programme. He just wanted me out of the way so he could spent time with mum. He didn't care about my sleep cycle, he just wanted me out the room full stop. I wasn't doing anything. In fact, I was deliberately trying NOT to draw attention to myself because he would be harassing me to go to bed, when I just wanted to watch TV. \n\nI think you need to seriously think about how he views time with your kids. They may have a bedtime now at their age, but as they get older - that bedtime will get later and later. If the real reason is, he wants the kids out of the way, how will he deal with the fact that as they get older they will take over more of the house. They will be up as late as the adults, have friends over etc. Would he be able to handle that if he secretly wants them to just buggar off to bed and be quiet.", "NTA. \n\nYou told him that bedtime doesn't exist on vacation, and now he's mad because.... you told him the truth?

Yet, you say this is the first time you have seen this side of him.   I am thinking not.  It seems he has already been very co trolling about your children\u2019s bedtimes.   I see a huge red flag here.  One, the way he reacts about their bedtimes, two, the dismissal of your words prior to vacation and three, not only the lack of respect for your words, or what you call your warning, but for you, your children and your family.  Seriously need to rethink marrying this man.", "Sounds like he has a fetish for control, and that you already knew about that. I thought it was weird that you felt the need to so strongly warn him about their bedtimes during this trip, but now I see it\u2019s because you really DO know what he\u2019s like, and that the assurance you gave us that you\u2019ve never seen behavior like this from him before this was either a lie, or that you\u2019re in denial.\n\nNTA, but you would be if you were to marry this man and subject your children to his control.

But might explain it.\n\nI am going to suggest sitting down, a few times, with him, and getting to know about HIS childhood.  I read your comments.  Did his Dad rule the house? Did his Mom embarrass him by dressing inappropriately, therefore making him sensitive to your sports bra?   Did he find his parents controlling? Did they stick to schedules?  Explore how he thinks a household should run. Don't debate him - yet.  You need to find out first, so don't argue with him until he has expressed himself.\n\nAnd the thing about bedtime ... Is it ONLY after the kids go to bed that he gets your complete and undivided attention?  He may not know it, but this was a thing even when raising kids with their father, for their whole life.

She could not handle having a young teen and the minimal steps towards independence I was ready for. By that, I mean hanging out with my fellow goody two-shoes overachiever friends. A parent needed to be present, although neither her nor my father was ever available to be that parent. It was bad enough in middle school, but once I hit high school it was ridiculous. This was part of the toxicity she permanently brought out in my father. Thanks to their emotional, verbal, and psychological abuse, I had to get out of that house at 16.  I\u2019m extremely thankful that I was in a nice area with excellent services for teens. You'd think I was a horrible rebellious uncontrollable child.

Hugs from an internet mom!", "You're correct with the gender. I have a feeling it would have been easier for me if I had been a boy rather than the stand-in for a son. They wouldn't know what to do if I had actually been the \"throwaway teen\" or \"failure as a human being\" they told me I was. I've been permanently estranged from my father since I had to move out at 16. The kick-out/move-out was a combination of \"you aren't going to live with us anymore\" from them and \"let's get you the heck out of that house\" from every other adult around me. According to my younger sister (who made it to 18 before getting kicked out for different reasons), our stepmother divorced our father years ago, but he has confirmed that he will never apologize for anything he put us through because he doesn't think he did anything wrong. My sister is a nicer and more forgiving person than me, as she's merely low contact to my no contact with our father. I celebrated the 2 decades out of that house in 2021 and I'm still dealing with the psychological fallout. I'm pretty angry that they pulled me out of marching band twice (partly as punishment and partly as a misunderstanding of how vitiligo should be handled for outdoor activities). Good times!", "Understandably so! My stepmother always tried to be a replacement for my mum, who I\u2019d never had a close relationship with. Ofc to her disappointment that changed when she literally \u2018banished\u2019 me to my mothers house and I didn\u2019t go back. (She went through my phone and specifically searched through my discord for anything nasty I had ever said about her, to get me in trouble. It happened once a year, I gained back her trust, and rinse and repeat. Fun going through that as a teen).\nI\u2019m almost 18 now so very glad she\u2019s out of the picture :)", "Isn't it though??  I'm sorry for your loss...we lost my father-in-law to GBM in 2000 -- 3.5 weeks from diagnosis to death.", "Considering what they put the poor kid through I guess it was to have a pawn for their perversions. Maybe money as well. I honestly can't read too much about these cases because it makes me sick", "Walter Matthau was awesome in that movie.", "Old folks know.", "Ugh so sorry for your loss too. That\u2019s such a tight timeline, we thought 9 months was bad! He was only 56 too. So cruel \ud83d\udda4", "They won't hibernate because they're bears. They torpor! \ud83d\ude00\n\nhttps://www.fourpawsusa.org/campaigns-topics/topics/help-for-bears/brown-bear-torpor-or-hibernation", "Indeed!  And I hope there are others here of a similar age to me that remember the 1976 original!", "Legitimately had an issue like this as a kid because of The Mighty Ducks. I was told it was about a hockey team and my wee toddler brain was excited af to watch a movie about ducks playing hockey. You can imagine my immeasurable disappointment when there were no ducks to be seen.", "\ud83d\ude21 What the heck", "What the fuck. My day is ruined \ud83d\ude14", "We\u2019re so old. \ud83d\ude1e", "Bears playing dice in the alley.  Bears running an illegal sports betting ring. Bears that are the Mob", "So so old."]}
