This had inspired me to do the big chop & care for my natural hair. It took time, but I began to embrace & love my 4c hair.\n\nA few weeks ago, I got married. While planning it, I was set on the decision to wear a natural hairstyle for my big day. The main reason being that I don\u2019t have any pictures of me during major milestones with my natural hair out.\n\n A few days before the wedding, my grandmother threw me a dinner party w/ only the women of the family & my bridesmaids. My aunt then asked me what I was going to do with my hair since the day was coming soon & I told her I was going to wear my hair out & showed her the style I was going to do.

I\u2019m sure you looked amazing", "I bet you looked fabulous :) Congratulations on your wedding! \n\nYour aunt\u2019s opinion is irrelevant but it was also extremely rude.

Your aunt was so out of line. It doesn't even matter that it's your wedding.  It's YOUR hair. As my mom used to say, as long as it's clean, who cares? And you gave your aunt exactly what she wanted. She can't have it both ways. Your dad is right.", "NTA.\n\nThat's so mean!  I think natural afros are very regal and cool looking (I had to go google 4c).\n\nHowever, there's not ONE damned thing wrong with natural hair. There's not a darned thing to \"die over\" if someone wears their hair completely natural and as big as it wants to be.  \n\n\nEDIT: had to finish my comment, stupid tap pad.", "That wasn't an opinion. That was rude and shitty attack and why should you be open to taking criticism when it's a matter of preference, you weren't and aren't looking for anybody else's opinion. Personally, since she'd \"die,\" I'd go ahead and provide her with CPR  instructions and one of those necklace buttons that summon paramedics. \n\nYou sound like a very strong, very proud, very wonderful woman and you have no need to apologize or beg for anything, and you'd be justified \"saving her life\" by uninviting her.

Typical in black families. Sweep the insults under the rug and honor/respect your elders no matter how they act or what they say. (I\u2019m black too so I know all to well). At most I would tell my aunt that what she said was offensive to you but you honored her wish to not want to sit and see your hair. Our hair, no matter the texture or length is our crowning glory. It\u2019s not your fault that she can\u2019t embrace what God gave you and she has no right to tell you you should never! How insulting and degrading. I wear my hair naturally curly and on the rare instance that I straighten it, I get \u201coh you\u2019re so beautiful with straight hair\u201d but God didn\u2019t make my hair straight. Kudos to you for standing your ground!", "NTA its your wedding and she was rude you can move her seat if you want you are still letting her come to the wedding which is more than what I could do.", "NTA\n\nYou should in fact be open to criticism-- CONSTRUCTIVE criticism-- not criticism designed to insult you, and then when that criticism is ignored, more insulting criticism. If someone had said that to the woman I was marrying, I would have told her that I would never have the poor taste to insult someone's vision for their wedding. I also would have moved her as you did.\n\nHaving said that, you could take the high road and go to her and explain how hurtful her comments were and how, if she could just admit how wrong it was to criticize you that way, you could probably forgive her.\n\nLeave the ball in her court, and tell the other elders of the family before you address things with her so that she can't try and sway them again as she obviously already has before about her insulting behavior.", "NTA! You do you, and your aunt needs to stfu. I had to google 4C too. It\u2019s gorgeous! Congratulations on your wedding, your journey of loving your natural hair, and standing up for yourself!!!! Don\u2019t apologize and don\u2019t back down.", "Hmm, it sounds like your mother might actually agree with your aunt (is that her sister, or your father's sister?).

Your solution was perfect.", "Umm, why do you need to be open to criticism of your hair? No. NTA.", "NTA - No ma\u2019am, no woman should be making another woman feel bad.

She deserved the demotion since she'd probably also be a judgmental drag on the day itself.\n\nI like your decision, btw. I don't get why people sometimes get so done-up for weddings that they don't even look like themselves. Your spouse isn't marrying someone with straight hair or a weave, so why on earth should your wedding photos reflect something completely different?", "NTA. Your natural hair sounds beautiful and I hope as other women embrace their natural hair your own community stops hating on itself.", "What the actual?\n\nYou have zero to apologize for. 4c is beautiful.
