Look at the part that discusses the custodial arrangements and the wording regarding the court's expectations- most that I have read have never stated that the child \"has to\" visit another parent- the agreements express expectations  for the adults but in the end, ultimately, the child can not be forced into a legal agreement in which they had no part in discussing.

Not listening right now\" and hang up or walk away. Help them understand that, if they want ANY relationship with you in the future, this is the summer for Taylor to take your will into consideration.\n\nBe smart about this - call an ombudsman or a lawyer today.", "NTA and I'm surprised that the court ordered you to go.  Generally they just go along with the wishes of a child your age and they certainly can't force you to go.", "Your court appointed advocate is useless.

If you don't go today, and they schedule a time to go to court/arbitration/etc, then that process has to come to an outcome, and say the outcome is that you have to go, you refuse again. Keep in mind that they can't really arrest you for not going, just try their best to force you. They would then have to get the police/bailiff/etc, to force you to go. There's no way that entire process is done in the less than a year until you turn 18. Time is on your side here amigo.", "NTA your 17 and the court can't force you.

Now, that might result in the judge ordering you to go visit but, if Taylor and your guardian ad litem (who I'm assuming is who you're referring to as your lawyer) are completely disregarding your feelings, then you could always appeal directly to the judge (via their assistant.)  \n  \nYou'll need to inform them of the and who you are.  I'd advise you to have a list of bullet points that you want to cover, in order, so that you don't get off track when talking to the judicial assistant, and go over the fact that you are being forced to visit, you absolutely don't want to go visit, the last visit was *horrible* for your mental health, that you're \"not capable of going to visit without having dangerous thoughts.\", and that this has been disregarded by the parties involved.", "My parents normal court order was that my dad got 6 weeks of the summer.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "Please report your cout appointed advocate.

At 17 I don't think they can keep you out of the entire hearing, maybe only parts.
