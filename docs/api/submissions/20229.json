Look at the part that discusses the custodial arrangements and the wording regarding the court's expectations- most that I have read have never stated that the child \"has to\" visit another parent- the agreements express expectations  for the adults but in the end, ultimately, the child can not be forced into a legal agreement in which they had no part in discussing.
