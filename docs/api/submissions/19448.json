She was diagnosed in February and didn't tell me until late March, although I already knew. My mum and I don't have a good relationship. My parents split up when I was 4 and I got to stay with my dad 2 nights a week. I have anxiety and depression, and I knew that staying at her house would make both of those things worse, but I decided to stay. It's been just over 2 months since she started chemo and things have gotten progressively worse since then. Last week, she nearly reversed the car into me and laughed about it. On Monday, she came back from chemo expecting me to have cooked for her, not knowing what time she'd be back, I hadn't done it. She had texted and called me, but my phone is on do not disturb and I wasn't using it, so I couldn't see her messages. She screamed at me, calling me a \"selfish b*tch\". She uses stuff like that to describe me often, but I'd had enough and told her I was going to stay with my dad. I've been staying with him for 6 days now and it's been so much better. My dad does live around 4.5 miles away from my school, which is impractical.\n\nMy mum has threatened to kick me out multiple times, and has kicked me out once. I came out to her as bi last year and straight away she told me it was just a phase. My dad took me to see her today so I could get some clothes. It seemed she was under the impression I would be staying overnight with her, but it was just to pop in. She called me a \"selfish cow\" and shouted at bothe and my dad. She wants me to move back in but the way she is treating me makes it less and less likely to happen. My granny died last year, and I made so many sacrifices to support her through that, but now that I finally put myself first I'm being punished for it. Seeing her today made me feel like I am the worst person in the world and the idea of going back terrifies me.", "created_utc": 1686400303, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/145z3s7/aita_for_moving_out_of_my_mothers_house/", "score": 16, "replies": ["##[AITA for blocking your go-to time killer from June 12-14?](https://redd.it/145o4jz)\n\nWelcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Verbal abuse is not okay. Also you're a minor, she can't expect you do be doing adult stuff and taking care of her.

It\u2019s not okay for her to treat you that way or speak to you that way.

Learning how to respect yourself after what has happened to you will take time and will be worth it. Be patient with yourself. You are on a good path to healing. \n\nHaving a parent treat you the way your mom does isn't right. Your mom should not be treating you this way. She has issues that she needs to work out and you aren't responsible for her feelings or actions.\n\nI'm glad you have a safe and loving home to go to with your dad. \n\nThis situation is a lot to handle.
