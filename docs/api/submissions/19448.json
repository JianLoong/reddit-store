I have anxiety and depression, and I knew that staying at her house would make both of those things worse, but I decided to stay. It's been just over 2 months since she started chemo and things have gotten progressively worse since then. Last week, she nearly reversed the car into me and laughed about it. On Monday, she came back from chemo expecting me to have cooked for her, not knowing what time she'd be back, I hadn't done it. She had texted and called me, but my phone is on do not disturb and I wasn't using it, so I couldn't see her messages. She screamed at me, calling me a \"selfish b*tch\". She uses stuff like that to describe me often, but I'd had enough and told her I was going to stay with my dad. I've been staying with him for 6 days now and it's been so much better. My dad does live around 4.5 miles away from my school, which is impractical.\n\nMy mum has threatened to kick me out multiple times, and has kicked me out once.

She wants me to move back in but the way she is treating me makes it less and less likely to happen.

I speak from experience. Being sick does not suddenly render their behavior acceptable. It's still okay to protect yourself.", "NTA \nI appreciate how shit the situation is and how it must make you feel guilty. \nThe best you can do right now is to focus on your mental health and cut the toxicity out of your life. \nShe\u2019s going through a lot right now, but she\u2019s an adult, you are a child.

If so, KEEP TRACK OF EVERYTHING, screenshot your messages with her, record your conversations, take pictures, everything. This will help your dad immensely if he decides to go for full custody of you.\n\nStay safe lil bit, and I applaud your courage.

My mom was diagnosed with cancer a few years ago, and endometrial cancer last year, and my sister was **THE WORST** to my mom throughout both treatments. She refused to take a different shift at work (she's a host at a restaurant) so she could drive my mom to surgery when they live together. I took the day off both times (I work in an office, and I almost got fired the first time because that boss was a dick. One of those \"we're family here\" offices, but it turns out he treats his actual family like shit, too). My mom stopped giving my sister treatment updates because she always had shitty responses. She was basically acting like my mom got cancer twice, on purpose, specifically to make my sister's life harder, and I started this defensive thinking if my mom.

If your dad will let you live with him full time, then do it.  Change schools if you have to.

Do not let her illness make you feel guilty.  Hugs.", "NTA", "NTA Your mom is abusive. Stay with your dad.", "You are absolutely NTA.

Please stay with your dad as much as you can. You deserve to feel safe.", "You should not be a caregiver for you Mom.  But you mom needs some support system. Maybe your dad can help her get one set up?  She needs to contact the social worker at wherever she is getting chemo, or have her doctor get her in touch with one.

You do not need to go back to an abusive household. How your mother has treated you is not okay or normal. You have all the right to put your mental and physical health first and stay in safe environment, aka with your father.\n\nIf possible, could you talk with someone about your feelings? Friends, school councelor, psychologist, therapist? It's important that you feel heard, and that you understand it's not your fault your mother treated you like that. You didn't deserve it. Good friends are enough if you can't or don't want to talk with a professional. Take time to focus on your life now. She has put way too much pressure on you, asked too much from you.

You deserve to live in a peaceful home, not one full of fear.", "NTA!! Regardless of whether or not she has an illness, she has no right to treat you that way. Even if it might be the cause of the behavior, there is still nothing that jusitifies it. What she's doing is a form of abuse, and you as a child are not obligated to these adult responsibilities. As a child, what is best for you should be her #1 priority, and you have every right to walk away from this abusive situation.\nThe way she treats people is why she'll be alone.", "NTA, it ain't nothing to cut that b\"tch off. The whole family argument, means NOTHING. Parents don't get to disrespect you just because you're a child.
