This goes beyond helping out, because it is really disruptive of your family life. Ubers are safe. She needs to find a more permanent solution for her rides home.", "NTA\n\n\"*Can you give me a lift on your way home from work*?\" OK\n\n\"*Can you wake up in the middle of the night and take me and my exotic dancer friends home*?\" NO WAY\n\nShe doesn't feel safe in ubers even with a group of other women? This is **super** sus and .... I would not be surprised if there's more to this story (I'm sorry).", "NTA \nYou are married and are allowed to set boundaries on things that make you uncomfortable. I can see how late night rides home from a club could make you uncomfortable. \n\nWould she do the same for him? Have him ask her for a favor at an inconvenient time and see how willing she is to help. You could be on to something with her taking advantage of him. Seems very odd that she would want him to give her a ride so late at night.", "NTA. She's using their friendship, especially if she's waking him up late at night and getting other people rides. He needs to set boundaries.", "NTA - Uber is safer than most taxis, you just don\u2019t hear about taxi problems because people can\u2019t identify the taxi.", "NTA. This is very intrusive and presumptuous, disruptive to your lives, and odd. I would feel this way if the friend were a male as well. She can find another mode of transportation home.", "NTA\n\nThese are very reasonable requests that you are making.", "NTA\n\nCalling your husband in the middle of the night on a regular basis is not only unreasonable but disturbing you as well.\n\nCan she not request a female Uber driver? \n\nWhatever, this is not his problem.", "Want to bet that the club has transportation the dancers can take home? Solely for their protection, as patrons can get awfully familiar when they\u2019re drunk. Source: I know a guy who once was a club chauffeur.", "Sorry, but this is utterly ridiculous--not because of her job or gender, but because your husband is being used as an Uber late at night.\n\nNTA. Tell him she has to stop immediately because you can't stand it anymore. Go to the mat over it. She can damn well take a real Uber, whether she's afraid or not. And her stuffing his car with her friends is yet further exploitation of their so-called friendship.\n\n'She is not his friend. She is his exploiter.", "NAH.\n\nI think anyone asking for a ride this frequently from a friend is a little unreasonable, regardless of gender or employment. Hopefully, she's chipping in for gas at the very least.\n\nThat being said, being a \"dancer\" doesn't automatically make one an out-of-control trollop. It's just a job, a decently paying one at that. The few strippers I've called my friends were better people than most of the folks in any church congregation. I also can't blame her entirely - it does come with risks and if your husband has offered her protection, at least for the ride home, then I would probably take him up on the same ride with no intentions of anything other than that. I think what your husband is doing is a very kind gesture.", "Oof, gonna go with NTA here assuming you calmly explained to him that this makes you uncomfortable before putting your foot down. I know I sure as hell would be extremely uncomfortable with my girlfriend/wife picking up a car full of males strippers in the middle of the night on a frequent basis.\n\nUbers are really easy to get, seems unnecessary for her to keep using your husband at a taxi service in the middle of the night.", "NAH. I do say that the friend is very unreasonable. Your husband isn't an Uber. And she is taking advantage of him being a friend and a man.\n\nThe only thing I can recommend is that you communicate as clearly as possible to him how you feel. Demands only go so far sometimes, and while i would hope he would respect you. Sometimes a little more conversation is needed.", "Jeez, NTA. There are many safety tips Uber offers to make sure you have the correct ride. Some examples,  check vehicle make and model (or see if it matches the car on the app) , check license plates, and confirm with the driver what is your name and theirs. Lastly, if homegirl is a stripper she should at least have some pepper spray. Cudos to you for your patience, I would have 0 for a situation like this.  good luck!", "he's cheating on you. sorry you found out this way.", "YTA. Your husband is an adult and can make his own decisions.", "NTA\n\n Can't you block her on his phone? Or change her number in the phone? I know it's shady, but  desperate times call for desperate meassure. Just to specify, i meant block her in the night so that she can't call him. Unblock her in the morning so he doesn't realize.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

A lot of relationships have rules about friends of opposite sex, a lot also have rules on strip clubs / bars etc. Combining the two together just feels like a disaster waiting to happen.\n\nI don't believe it to be healthy for yourself to have to go through this. Also fuel is expensive why is your husband supporting her why doesn't she get a car. She has a job.\n\nAlso while I accept Uber has issues it is a lot safer than alternatives. The better option is again, she gets her own car.", "I am going with YTAH.  Only because of the information you have given.  You claim her making a move on him is not what bothers or concerns you.  The reasons you gave are ones that do not seem to effect you or the relationship (interrupting his sleep).  Now, if the real reason is because your husband is driving a bunch of dancers around late at night then I would say he is the MAJOR AH.  Communication with your loved one is important.  Being honest with yourself is extremely important.", "No, he is sleeping with her", "YTA.... Sorry but if this friend was a guy would you have the same issue?  I don't think so. I think the OP is reading into the friendship, a lot more than is there and making her decisions based upon her perception of potential infidelity when there is none.  Her Husband has a friend who's down on their luck...  If they can lend a hand and it's not hurting anyone, then what's the problem", "I can see both sides NTA side your husband is in hot water to begin with doing that with a wife YTA side this is a friendship of 8 years which means there has to be a strong bond there it\u2019s just 2 friends helping each other out and at the end of the day wouldn\u2019t you want your husband doing that instead of killing robbing raping etc \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f idk I see both sides pretty even", "NTA", "NTA.

My guess is he either has unresolved feelings for her, or is getting some sort of benefit.  No adult man is getting up and giving rides to someone that isnt his wife (and hearing grief about it) out of the goodness of his heart.  NTA.", "NTA\n\nTalk to her yourself and tell her she has to stop calling for free lifts at all times of the night Even throw out the question to her. Ask, \"is she having a relationship with your husband?\" That will close it down straight away.", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s using him as an Uber.", "NTA. He's felt bad for eight years for her?  I seriously doubt that.  He's up to something.", "NTA. Why would he volunteer to be middle of the night stripper cab?? All those tips and no one could come up with cab fare? No boyfriends within the group willing to ferry them?", "NTA and there is way more to this story than your husband is telling you.  No one is getting up in the middle of the night without a darn good reason.", "NTA she\u2019s more than a friend", "Seriously lady, you\u2019re nuts if you think you have any right to tell anyone what to do ever in your entire life, check your insecurities at the door and don\u2019t ever tell a grown man what he can or can\u2019t do", "NAH\nthe only thing i see here being problematic if you would be awoken by the call. if that's not the case your husband is free to get his sleep interrupted, if he choses. who am i to tell him that he isn't allowed to get up. i personally wouldn't but well. on the other things: trust is key in a marriage. i would trust my husband to turn down anyone hitting on him, so i don't mind if it would happen.", "Nta it sounds like she wakes him out and he\u2019s going out of his way. If he could help her in the normal course of his day, fine, but if he is getting out of bed and it\u2019s a continuing thing she needs to find a different solution.", "NTA. This is stupid. I used to be a dancer and plenty of decent humans would be willing to give a ride home and are already awake and hanging at the club. One of the other dancers boyfriends for example, the dj, one of the bouncers, one of the other girls or a bartender. In a small town there was still enough ride opportunities to never need to wake anyone up and I danced way before Uber existed. She\u2019s being weird. Your husband doesn\u2019t need to leave home in the middle of the night.", "For the sake of playing devils advocate there are lot of issues with Uber also. Mainly the fact there is no screening to become a driver. Lots of people report drivers but they can just signup again with another phone number.", "You can't request a female uber driver, it matches you with the closest driver in the algorithm.", "So she, as his wife, should agree with all his decisions? What if his decision is to cheat on her ?", "Why does them being dancers have any merit?  Are dancers incapable of Platonic friendships like the rest of us?", "Bruh did you even read the post \ud83d\udc80", "Still safer than taxis, for the driver, and passenger. It\u2019s not perfect by any means, but still much safer. A local taxi driver assaults someone, if they were to get identified and caught, it usually doesn\u2019t make national news. Uber, while a shitty corporation, is nationwide. Any assault, by even someone pretending to be an Uber driver makes headlines. You get into a Uber, you have a record of the license plate and most people don\u2019t track that with taxis. The driver also has a way of tracking the passenger. There isn\u2019t any cash exchanging hands like with most taxis.", "then she can chose to divorce :D\nHe is a free human being and if you doesn't mind getting his sleep interrupted he is free to do so.", "Nope, but the probabilities are considerably higher.  Might sound inappropriate, but sometimes the truth is.", "And this is based on personal belief and ancedotes or actual truth?  \n\nIf truth please feel free to site your sources to that.  Because last I checked generalizing a group of people without anything to back it up is pretty inappropriate."]}
