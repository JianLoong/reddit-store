I'm on mobile so I'm sorry for the format.\n\nFor the sake of privacy (and in case this goes on tiktok and my family sees it) ages have been changed. \n\nI (15 enby) am going off to college in September, I'm in the UK so this is normal, lol. The only problem is the college I'm going to is in the town next to me, I have made the decision to move in with my dad (40M) since he lives literally what, 25? 30 mins away from the campus, my mum (41M) has agreed. (Important note:My parents divorced when I was 9.) When I told my mum, she laughed at first because my dad is a part time carer for my brother (29M) who has autism, adhd, pica, mobility issues, etc. and my dad only lives in a 2 bedroom house, so she thinks I'll be sleeping in the living room which is what I do currently when I visit on weekends. I told my dad this, and he said I won't be sleeping in the living room and my brother will be moving back in with my mom and I'll be having his bedroom, now before I continue, my brother is my HALF brother, he is my mum's son, my dad is not related to him at ALL. When they divorced my mum dumped him onto my dad and collects his benefits and dad doesn't get a single penny of his money, my dad does work but he struggles a bit. Anyway, I haven't told my mum she'll be taking my brother back, because me and my dad are worried she'll try stop me from moving out, so we're going to tell her after my prom so not only can she not stop me from moving out, but she can't stop me going to prom, which is what she's like. \n\nWe also think that if my mum has to take care of my brother, her boyfriend (34-36M, I don't know his age because he's lied about his year of birth to me multiple times.) is going to either leave her or cause more and more arguments. This doesn't bother me since I don't like him and he's a horrible person, not getting into that though. My brother is extremely high needs, he has accidents in the night, he hurts himself when things go wrong, he is at risk for seizures in his sleep/throughout the day and is VERY loud. I don't mind this, though since he's my brother and I love him. So I don't think it was fair for my mum to just give him to my dad when it's her own son. There's also the problem of my mum's authority, she does not know how to oarent AT ALL, and relies on my older siblings to try and scare us into behaving (i. e if we said something about not liking the food, they'd say \"oh if we said that we would get slapped\") which obviously doesn't work, fear is never a good tactic, so reddit, take my fate into your hands and tell me. AITA?\n\nTL;DR my mum has to take her disabled son back when I move into my dads for college\n\nedit: social services are involved!! ty all who are concerned for his welfare but if anything my mums house is better than my dads because of the area we live in, its very rough and the house does not fit my brother, hes 6'0, super strong despite being skinny", "created_utc": 1678556741, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11oq6gk/aita_for_being_the_reason_my_mom_has_to_take_back/", "score": 156, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If she is claiming benefits for your brother, which if mine are anything to go by it's at least \u00a320k a year, but not actually caring for your brother then she could be forced to pay back every penny as well as a fine and prison sentence if the DWP think it's serious enough.", "NTA, and I agree with other comments suggesting a heads up call to social services so they can be aware. Might be worth her having some home visits and there should be some home health care aides or respite care to help her (but really it would be a set of eyes on your brother to make sure he stays safe)", "NTA\n\nYou are moving on with your life by going to college. You shouldn't have to hold yourself back and blame yourself for your brother.", "NTA for causing this chain of events, but are you telling me that your vulnerable brother is just going to be passed off into what sounds like a terrible household?\n\nyou might not be TA but goddamn is your brother the victim here \ud83d\ude33", ">*I (15 enby) am going off to college in September, I'm in the UK so this is normal, lol.* \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>*now before I continue, my brother is my HALF brother, he is my mum's son, my dad is not related to him at ALL.* \n\nI really don't know how to tell you this, but your mum seems like a horrible mum who forgot that having a child means that there's a chance your child might be disabled.  I am glad to see that child welfare services are involved, but good lord, she does not seem like a loving, caring mum! \n\nAs an autistic person myself, I really don't understand why your mom feels it okay to put this kind of responsibility on you when you're about ready to head off to uni. The fact that your brother's *stepfather* took on some of the responsibility of raising your brother is incredibly honorable of him, and he seems like someone who is really caring.  But I also believe is also in his right to stop being the caregiver of your disabled brother. \n\nIt is normal for children to help take care of their siblings to small degrees, such as pouring them a bowl of cereal or helping them with homework.  But taking on the role of being a caregiver for your disabled brother *should* be a job for a trained professional.  That is a very, very demanding job your mum just assumed you would be taking on *on top of* going to university to pursue your career.   \n\nNTA.  I really, really hope your disabled brother gets the help he so desperately needs and deserves!", "Info - how exactly are y'all planning on forcing your mom to take your brother? Just drop him on her doorstep and hope for the best? \n\nBecause a woman who can convince her ex to to take in an unrelated special needs adult after the divorce and without monetary support is not a woman who is going to accept all this without a fuss.\n\nUnless there is some way of enforcing all this.... It's going to be ugly. None of it is your fault,  but I can't help but feel bad about your brother,  who is being bounced around like a hot potato.\n\nBut that's not your problem,  it's your parents. You have every right to go to college,  but don't be shocked if your brother ends up staying with your dad and you end up on the couch.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I would think that a parent -- a proper parent, that is -- would make sure their kid is always given the best care for in life.  She was the one that desperately wanted a kid nearly 3 decades ago.
