But you kind of have to accept her answer because it is a public space.", "careful NTA,\n\nI mean some cafes even have the sign with the phone volume down. If it' s constant disturbance and the sound is annoying just ask her. If you are polite about it I don' t think there's anything wrong with it. But she is in a public space and if she abides by the place's policy she can refuse you easily.", "NTA. Ask the woman to reduce the volume on her phone. People go to coffee shops hoping for some peace and quiet... meaning some quiet background noise - not complete silence.\n\nShe can put the phone on vibrate (still annoying, but less so) and go on with her day.\n\nThis reminds me of people talking loudly on their phones in stores, on the airplanes, and so on.  Yikes!\n\nYou might tell the waitstaff at the coffee shop you plan to talk to this woman just in case she flips out and becomes combative... maybe they would even intervene for you. Good luck!", "Nta", "She's not doing anything wrong by having her phone notification sounds on. \n\nI don't think you would be an AH for asking her to silence it or turn it down, but also, you're in a public space... if you want peace and quiet then maybe just stay at home if you're going to get that irritated by someone's phone notifications. \n\nNAH.", "NTA...Though to avoid drama, I would likely alert restaurant staff to the disruption.  There are likely others all asking themselves the same question you're asking us.", "NTA. Doesn't have to silence it completely, but just ask her to turn down the volume a bit.", "NTA.  That is excessive.", "I ONLY have my phone sound on if I am waiting for an important text/call\u2026.

Do same as them and make sure they hear you", "YTA. i listened to your little mp3. the cafe wasn\u2019t even that quiet and the phone ringing wasn\u2019t that loud. put on some headphones and recognize that you\u2019re in a public space.

If the ringing really bothers you you could just turn towards her, get her attention, *smile* and say something like \u201ehi, excuse me. I don\u2019t mean to be rude, but would you mind silencing your phone while we\u2019re both sitting here? If there is a reason the ringer needs to be on lmk and I\u2019ll understand, I just thought I\u2019d ask.\u201c\n\nI\u2019d be really curious what kind of results that would get, so OP if by any chance you\u2019re still there, it\u2019d be really cool if you tried it!

It may be annoying but it is what it is.", "While I agree that sounds annoying YTA for expecting people modify their behaviour in a public space to suit you. She\u2019s perfectly entitled to have her phone on loud and receive texts.", "NAH. People have different tolerances for this sort of thing, and what she\u2019s doing is not unreasonable in a public space. If it\u2019s bothering you, I don\u2019t think you\u2019d be TA for asking her to turn it down, as long as you (1) ask politely and (2) take no for an answer.", "NTA. She's being inconsiderate. People saying YTA like to remind you it's a public place. They're right. But it's her that needs to be reminded of that and ought to be respectful. If it was just a couple times, sure. But every few moments? Come on. I wonder how much of this is a cultural difference with people saying YTA and calling you entitled. I was raised in an Asian society and honestly, we'd say the opposite. IMO, she's TA.", "NTA", "Omgggg.. just get yourself some noise canceling headphones. Why all the arguments in the comments? It\u2019s NO ONES job to make you comfortable. It\u2019s YOUR job to adapt to your environment. If you want quiet, stay home or get those headphones. Get over yourself.", "NTA. Tell the staffers to help you out. This is distracting!", "The interior of a cafe is not a public space. It is a private space, maintained by the cafe owners for the benefit of their customers (and therefore their own benefit).", "What if every single person in the cafe had their notification sounds on? It's an annoyance if it's one person... it's absolute chaos if it's everyone.", "LOL my mom always has the sound up on her tablet when we go over there. It is mildly annoying to me, my husband hates it. I guess i might have to mention that she can turn it down or put it on silent. It chimes constantly, she must have it set for any and all notifications possible!", "This is the answer.  Mention the frequency and level of noise - putting it on vibrate might be sufficient.", "What about somebodt having their ringer on in a movie theater?\n\nIs my option there to leave the theater?", "What? I'm not entitled to the same level of comfort at the person who's phone is ringing?", "So if you are out in public is it ok to have  someone scream in your ear?

That seems like the logical move here.", "Wow really, that small beeping is bothering you? If you're that sensitive to other noises you're probably better off getting takeout and eating at home. I understand it happening often is frustrating, but it's a public space and honestly kids with their tablets on full blast are way more annoying than this.", "What? No it's not. If this person is alone, then obviously it's not bad manners to be texting in public. It's only bad manners if she's on a date or something. She also wasn't even attending to the text, they were just coming in and making noises.   \n\n\nDid you read the story? It doesn't seem like it.", "So sorry for not being 100% clear in my statement for you...But I bet you knew what I meant.", "Then they have notifications on...? This is a NAH because you have a right to ask but you're in public so there's nothing you can do if they say no.

The horror.\n\nAre you 12? Grow up", "Both my parents (79) have it set on high volume. My Dad owns his own business... phone rings constantly... on high. My mother will often grab her phone to answer it when his rings. SMH ... I\u2019m completely oblivious to phone sounds now.", "Hardly the same scenario. There are social expectations that come with being in certain places: a theater, a funeral, a church, a ceremony, etc. where silencing phones is expected and not to do so is incredibly discourteous. \n\nA cafe? Nah.", "You had the same level of comfort", "Nope", "Honestly, I don\u2019t feel I have any control of other people so I would just solve my own problem. Headphones work magically in this situation. This is a you problem. So solve it. \n\nImo ... there\u2019s literally nothing here that is stopping you from enjoying your coffee. Why waste your time & energy being annoyed by something you have the power to fix? Get up & move.", "Me personally? I wouldn't care. It's not a big deal. If it's annoying, I have earphones.", "Or a flashing light.  I know hearing-impaired people who use this.", "The logical answer is move your seat & stop worrying about the stranger sitting near you.", "Then you'll need to look at every notification. I also have different  rings for work , text messages and even certain contacts. I can tell from the sound if I can ignore it or if I need to respond.  If it's on vibrate I'm looking at it all the time", "lol yes kids with their tablets are. That's so clear cut that I wouldn't even bother to post it here. I would ask the kids  (or the parents) to turn them down.\n\nI don't know when it became acceptable to essentially be watching your own personal television at restaurants.", "I understood you fine. \"We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone\" is a thing for a good reason.", "I think people get used to it.... but they don't realize that nobody else around them is used to the sound of \\*their\\* phone notification.", "I guess I was operating under the impression that there are certain social expectations in a cafe/restaurant?\n\nIt's a slippery slope. Let's say you're eating dinner at a Michelin star restaurant and the person at the table next to you has their phone sounds on? Or takes a call in the middle of dinner?", "No one is talking about refusing service.", "If your expectation is you set the rules & everyone should understand & live their lives within your comfort zone then.... I don\u2019t honestly know how you deal with being around other people in public spaces. People are annoying .... and life goes on.\n\nAt the very least, give her credit for starting this online debate for you that\u2019s kept you entertained.", "There is no slippery slope here. You were in a public space, a cafe, where there is no expectation of somebody having to pipe down for your comfort. Again, don\u2019t post here if you\u2019re going to argue with everyone who isn\u2019t on your side in the matter.", "Of course we are. If the owner asks the noisy patron to turn it down, and they refuse, then out the door they must go."]}
