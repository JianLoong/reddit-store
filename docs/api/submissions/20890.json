Or back when they started making public spaces smoke free, including on airlines. I\u2019m sure many people back then were annoyed as well because they felt they were entitled to smoke in a public space. I think with the technology advances and changes in society were in a transition period of finding out what\u2019s an acceptable etiquette in regards to things like phones and iPads and laptops.

Obviously it was loud, yet, with the amount of noise there was from people talking and kids screaming, it was the only way you could hear the audio... but here is where my GF and I differ.\n\nShe said it was rude for the woman to ask to turn the volumen down when there was a lot of noise around and only seeming to tell her about it but not the couple with the kids screaming next to both of us, yet, even if that is true, I told her that what made the woman rude was not \"what she said, its how she said it\", because she acted like snob, saying \"thank you\" before my GF could even give a response and putting a face where it was obvious the she was kinda bad looking at us.\n\nIn conclusion, if you asked politely and in no way did you acted disrespectful, then for me you would be NTA, but the other person can either do what she want, as if it wasnt loud music playing in a public place, then she can have it ring however she want, even if it isnt very respectful what she is doing.", "NTA, she can turn it down and still when texts come through!", "NTA, but I would ask the waiter or the manager to speak with her.
