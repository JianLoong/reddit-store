But how is it any different when you\u2019re in a movie theatre and they ask you to turn off your ringer on your phone to respect the people around you trying to enjoy the movie? Or back when they started making public spaces smoke free, including on airlines. I\u2019m sure many people back then were annoyed as well because they felt they were entitled to smoke in a public space. I think with the technology advances and changes in society were in a transition period of finding out what\u2019s an acceptable etiquette in regards to things like phones and iPads and laptops.

I'm sorry the noise can be annoying, but so can other people's conversations, or someone tapping a pencil, or a noisy keyboard, or loud breathing, or clacky shoes,  or a runny nose, or laughter, or a million other things that reminds you other people exist.

Obviously it was loud, yet, with the amount of noise there was from people talking and kids screaming, it was the only way you could hear the audio... but here is where my GF and I differ.\n\nShe said it was rude for the woman to ask to turn the volumen down when there was a lot of noise around and only seeming to tell her about it but not the couple with the kids screaming next to both of us, yet, even if that is true, I told her that what made the woman rude was not \"what she said, its how she said it\", because she acted like snob, saying \"thank you\" before my GF could even give a response and putting a face where it was obvious the she was kinda bad looking at us.\n\nIn conclusion, if you asked politely and in no way did you acted disrespectful, then for me you would be NTA, but the other person can either do what she want, as if it wasnt loud music playing in a public place, then she can have it ring however she want, even if it isnt very respectful what she is doing.", "NTA, she can turn it down and still when texts come through!", "NTA, but I would ask the waiter or the manager to speak with her.

OP let themselves get too riled up to the point of recording her and posting on reddit instead of doing any of the above simple solutions. Who knows? That person is probably used to it and not thinking of how it\u2019s bothersome. All you have to do is politely communicate. If that person gets offended or upset, then that\u2019s a different story.
