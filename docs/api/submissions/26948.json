In that time, I have never cheated on him nor has he, as far as I know, cheated on me. We have a good relationship and love each other very much. \n\nA few months ago, I got a new coworker (\"Dave\"). He's a very nice guy, a few years younger than me, and undeniably hot. I was attracted to him instantly.  In the months since Dave started, he and I have become rather close (professionally speaking). We work on projects together, often eat lunch together, and have a good, solid, work friendship. We talk a lot about non-personal things (workouts, books, movies, etc), but not much that is personal. He knows I'm gay and married and I know he's single, but not whether is straight or gay.  \n\nThen, about a month ago, Dave invited me to work out with him. I had been telling him that I was trying to put on some muscle as well as lose weight. Dave has been an avid \"gym rat\" (his term) since he was a teenager and knows much more than I do about good workout habits and routines. So, with my husband fully aware, Dave and I started working out together two to three times a week.\n\nThis only made my attraction stronger. Dave and I would leave work, change into workout clothes at the gym, do our routines, and then shower and change together when we were done (like many other male friends working out together). Now that I have seen him naked on numerous occasions, I find myself thinking about him more...and not in a platonic way.\n\nNow, I was content to just let it go at that. I have no intention of ever cheating on my husband. I have had sexual attractions to other men before, as has my husband. We are both well aware that loving each other does not mean we don't find other guys sexually attractive. As well, even if I DID want to cheat on my husband, I don't even know whether or not Dave is A) attracted to men and, if so, B) attracted to me.\n\nThen, the other day, I was talking to a long-time friend of mine. I told him the same things I mentioned here. I also told him that I had no intention of telling my husband, since I had not done anything inappropriate with Dave, nor had Dave ever indicated he would be open to that if I had tried.\n\nMy friend, though, insists I have to tell my husband. He says it's different than past sexual attractions, though, for two reasons.\n\n1) Dave and I work closely together almost every day.\n\n2) Dave and I work out together and, because of that, see each other naked in the locker room and gym showers on a regular basis.\n\nHe says to not tell my husband, given those two things, would make me an asshole. He says that I'm spending enough time with Dave, including time unclothed, that I have to be up front and confess to my husband that I am attracted to Dave and have some non-platonic feelings for him.\n\nSo, Reddit, is my friend right?\n\nEDIT: Thank you, Reddit.  I've read every response, even the ones I didn't reply to.  I have not, nor would I ever, cheat on my husband.  But, people brought up an emotional affair...which, honestly, I had never considered.  I can't say those people are wrong though.  I just didn't recognize it for what it was.\n\nI accept my judgement.  I'm an asshole and I accept that.  I'm going to talk to my husband this weekend and put some distance between me and Dave.", "created_utc": 1694818621, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16jrlq5/aita_for_not_telling_my_husband_im_attracted_to_a/", "score": 207, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

On top of that you think about him more and more in sexual terms. You are having a full blown emotional affair", "Yta your friend is right. You aren't telling him because you know it's inappropriate on your end. It's your little fantasy you dance near the edge of no return on. The fact that you feel as you do for him meant it wasn't appropriate to pursue any dynamic with him. You say your husband knows but I'm curious if he is aware of how attracted you are to him and that you are showering together. As a gay man I'd dump you.", "Yta this sounds like the beginning of an emotional affair. You said ur growing more attracted to him and u choose to spend more time with him. It honestly sounds like the only reason nothing has happened is cause he hasn't made a move on u and it feels like ud be pretty receptive considering how u keep thinking about his body.", "YTA. Affairs don\u2019t start with sex- they start exactly where you are. You claim to be committed to your husband, but here you are spending as much time as possible with a man you\u2019re attracted to, as well as fantasizing about him. You should\u2019ve put him at arm\u2019s length the second you realized you might be attracted to him. You\u2019re playing a dangerous game of rationalization, as IMO you\u2019re already cheating. Don\u2019t lie to yourself; you\u2019d jump into bed with him if he came on to you. You might think you wouldn\u2019t, but you would. If you love your husband and are committed to your marriage, come clean now, and cut this guy off. If you can\u2019t bring yourself to do this, let your husband free to find someone he deserves.", "I\u2019m in a heterosexual relationship so I\u2019m imaging my spouse hanging out with some hot chick and working out with her, having a very close professional relationship with and I really wouldn\u2019t be ok with it. I think what makes it inappropriate is the building of feelings that you\u2019re having. I\u2019m loyal to the bone so I\u2019d agree with your friend right and YTA. \nNow, not saying you need to go spill all the beans to your hubby but I\u2019d really rethink the interactions you have with your co-worker. Would your spouse care if you had a male friend that you\u2019re hanging out with? Is there any lying to cover your tracks? If not, maybe  more of a conversation with the hubby might give you better clarification on what\u2019s expected with male friends and any boundaries you have or have not crossed ?!!!", "I think your husband would be a lot less comfortable with you spending so much time with Dave if he knew that you were attracted to him. For me, that's the answer right there.\n\nOther than the above I won't weigh in you being TA or not, BUT I do want to say: tread carefully here, friend. As someone in a monogamous relationship, when I find myself attracted to someone outside my relationship, I try to spend *less* time with that person, not more. I think you are walking a very dangerous line here, whether you realize it or not.", "Yes. If I were you, I would leave the gym, reduce interactions with Dave to strictly work and bare minimum, tell my husband that I am attracted to Dave and and also tell Dave why I am distancing from him and put a strong boundary there. The emotional energy leaking from a relationship becomes obvious sooner or later, even if your husband does not know and cannot put a finger on it, he will subconsciously start feeling the difference. Let it go, friend. It\u2019s not worth it.\n\nSay goodbye to Dave whether or not your husband asks for it. That\u2019s what two of you deserve. \u2764\ufe0f", "I would say YTA, your friend is kinda right, this isn't just \"oh this person looks good and if I was single I would think about it\" but you are actively putting yourself in a situation where you see that person naked on a regular basis and that's not okay.", "YTA for sure. You may have not done anything physically with Dave, but you're moving into the direction of having an emotional affair with Dave. What you are doing is not at all appropriate. If you really love your husband, you better damn well make sure you're loyal to him, period. I think its time that you should put some distance between you and Dave, and stop this behavior, one thing for all.", "YTA. If you were only work friends and that's where it ends, it would be appropriate to not say \"hey I'm attracted to this guy I work with\" for no apparent reason. But you have moved far beyond that with 3x a week gym hangouts and naked locker room time. Time to tell your husband you are lusting after your gym buddy (okay, probably not with that phrase). \n\nAnd fwiw, I think you need to stop this now.", "YTA, if you are checking out this \"dave\" while he's naked.. You've already crossed enough lines in my opinion. If it was my spouse/ bf getting naked around a girl he was attracted to I'd lose my shit. Even if she wasn't interested at all. Stop working out together and have some respect for your spouse and co worker. Edited to add: tell your spouse they deserve to know all of this.", "YTA. This is way more than sexual attraction.  Finding someone else sexually attractive is an entirely different thing than choosing to spend 3 evenings a week with that person getting sweaty and then naked with him.  You may tell yourself it\u2019s innocent.  It\u2019s not.  Frankly, it\u2019s a bit creepy that you\u2019re willing to get naked with someone who doesn\u2019t know you have the hots for him.  \n\nYou\u2019re having an emotional affair.  Now maybe it\u2019s one-sided, but you\u2019re setting yourself up to fall.  \n\nEven if you choose to not tell your husband, you need to end the after work voyeurism thing you\u2019ve got going on.

You need to put some distance between the two of you.

You're hiding it intentionally and you know that's wrong.", "YTA - Wow, you're literally almost inches away from some porn fantasy come to life and we want us to believe that you'd never go for it. That's a lie if I had ever heard one.\n\nYou're acting as though you're just sneaking glances at Dave at his desk and having short *what-if* daydreams about him. If that were the case, I may be able to find it acceptable if you didn't tell your husband since that is nothing is happening here, and just a confession that you're maybe a little creepy.\n\nHowever, you are infatuated with this man and getting closer and closer to him. Your husband deserves a say in whether or not he trusts you in this type of situation and I believe you're not telling him because you know he would be uncomfortable with this.", "YTa, you're veering into dangerous territory and right now the only obstacle is Dave possibly being straight or not into you.\nEmotionally you've gone well past merely finding him attractive!\n\nNow, if you tell your husband would you be ready to accept consequences, such as no more gym time with Dave?", "You seem to at most, be having an emotional affair with this man. Or at the very least are lying to him by omission. YTA", "YTA.  Part of being gay and marrying another gay guy is looking at other guys and whispering to each other about how hot they are, so I won't judge you on that (trust me, I'm just as guilty).  But you really do need to be honest about how you feel when this happens, *especially* when it *doesn't* get in the way of you and your husband's love.  If he learned it from anyone other than you, he likely won't see it as innocent.  Not letting him know could lead to heartbreak everywhere, so it's your resposibility to inform him of this attraction and its current effect on the marriage.", "Seems like you seriously want to fuck around and find out, OP, and Dave is why you want to bottom out. Your husband wouldn't appreciate that and that's why you're concealing the true nature of your relationship with the other man.\n\nAre you having an emotional affair? Yes. Do you need to stop now? Hell yes. Because, seriously, you're fuckin' around and will soon find out if you don't stop.\n\nYes, YTA.", "YTA. The fact that you don't want to tell your husband is sketchy af.

What *matters* is what you do about it. Do I think you\u2019re being smart by spending a bunch of time with Dave? No. At least not if you want to be in a monogamous relationship. You\u2019re playing with fire & it seems that you\u2019re aware of that. \n\nThat said, what does your relationship have to gain by telling your husband you\u2019re sexually attracted to your coworker? Is this something you can\u2019t control & want permission to explore? Is it to soothe your own guilt? What is it? If my s/o cheated on me once, honestly? I wouldn\u2019t want to know. So long as he doesn\u2019t get another woman pregnant & so long as he doesn\u2019t bring home an STD, I can get past that but it doesn\u2019t mean I want to know the details. He can live with the guilt, but leave me out of that turmoil. \n\nThis situation & whether you want to disclose depends largely (imho) on what you plan to do. If you value your marriage & are committed to not putting it in jeopardy, you need to put some distance between yourself & Dave.

You're a grownup in control of your own actions, you're not going to have an affair, and fantasies don't hurt anyone.

Since you're not, that's an unnecessary thing for him to have to carry. \n\nThat is, however, a different matter from whether you want to stay in this situation for your own sake. Having a crush is fun, but feeling like you have something to hide isn't, and if the amount of time you're spending with Dave is distracting to you, you might want to pull back from him a little just for your own sake.
