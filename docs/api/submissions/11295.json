Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/xxc8uu/aita_for_telling_my_wife_shes_needs_to_be/). Recently someone commented on that post asking if my wife has left me yet, so I decided to update.\n\nA lot of people recognized that the way I spoke with my wife was full of frustration and anger, which was unproductive but even more than that, it was scary to my wife. [u/willoxash](https://www.reddit.com/u/willoxash/) had an excellent comment pointing out that I was just blowing off steam and that my priority should be my partnership.\n\nWe covered a lot of topics in the weeks following that incident. We had a couples therapy session to talk about strategies and communication. I saw one of my coworkers react in anger and frustration instead of taking the time to become calm and realized from the outside looking in just how unproductive his behavior was.\n\nAnd then my wife showed me a section of one of our self-help books. It's called The Five Personality Patterns and my therapist had recommended it to me a while back. We had been reading it together, my wife and I, but then we got busy and we stopped. She picked it back up after our fight and read about the \"leaving\" pattern. She underlined a bunch of sections and read them to me. And I finally understood.\n\nI grew up in a house where my parents screamed and yelled at each other or picked fights in order to storm out of the house, and that's how I used to interpret my wife's silence. As a way to \"win\" the fight. In reality, when she became silent, she was terrified. She wasn't stonewalling me, or trying to win the fight by manipulating me, or trying to avoid taking responsibility. She was so scared in that moment that she wasn't even in her body. She couldn't even speak, she was totally dissociated. She told me that even though she knows that how I was acting wasn't objectively scary, that her threshold for shutting down is really low.\n\nRealizing how much I scared my wife broke my heart. The descriptions of dissociation in the book were terrifying to me. My wife is the sweetest person, I love her so much and I never want her to experience what she experienced that day ever again. It changed my perspective completely.\n\nEver since my realization, our relationship is better than ever. We laugh and tease each other playfully. We have worked on projects together. We've talked about chores and money. We've even had a couple of fights and resolved them quickly and lovingly. Our communication is better because we trust each other. My wife told me that she has never felt safer or more loved now. I won't say I'm glad the fight happened, but what I realized because of it has been a turning point in our marriage for the better.", "created_utc": 1677772278, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11g62jx/update_aita_for_telling_my_wife_shes_needs_to_be/", "score": 7360, "replies": ["THAT is an awesome update!

People can change and couples can learn to grow together. If marriage counseling didn't work for some it wouldn't exist. I think that's always the best option if both are willing to at least try. Even if its to know in their heart they did everything they could to keep their family together and then call it quits. But for many people that just isn't possible.

He took that as me silently storming off because that is how we grew up, and got super upset. I had to sit him down later and be like \" I'm not mad at you, I set a boundary by asking you to stop splashing me or else I would leave, you didn't stop so I left. I dislike feeling angry so if verbal communication isn't working, I remove myself from the situation because my emotional overreaction is no one else's problem to deal with.\"\n\n It was an ah-ha moment for him because literally no one in our family is capable of stopping the anger train lol Anyway I'm just mentioning that story because I find that (almost overly) communicating to my partner helps avoid any misconceptions. Like \"I am annoyed at what you said but I'm not laying down in bed sulking, I just need space and time to process my own reaction to what you said; I'm not angry at you\".

There was never any \"harmless\" yelling that happened in my home.\n\nSo when my own temper flared, my thought was to protect him by taking myself away until I cooled off. He interpreted that as me punishing him. When he yelled at me and \"got it out\" he thought he was releasing the anger, and for him it went away. But it didn't go away for me, it just built up.

Kudos to you!!", ">A lot of people recognized that the way I spoke with my wife was full of frustration and anger, which was unproductive but even more than that, it was scary to my wife. u/willoxash had an excellent comment pointing out that I was just blowing off steam and that my priority should be my partnership.\n\nAt least you were able to take accountability and put effort into changing. If my soon to be ex husband could've done this it would have meant the world to me. But he could never admit to having a problem. He damn near destroyed me as a person by being so damned careless with the way he spoke to me. So good on you for acknowledging there was a problem and being honest about your role in it. It takes two people to make a relationship work but one person can easily destroy it.", "I\u2019m so happy for you and your wife op, being able to learn about each other, especially how each other behave when shit goes down, is so so important for a healthy relationship. It\u2019s amazing both of you worked together to make the relationship healthy. Congrats and I hope you and your wife can continue to resolve obstacles in life as partners :)", "OP, I'm glad you turned it around and really got a picture of where your wife was coming from, so that you could come back with understanding. Kudos on your commitment to your marriage, this is the kind of update from a former asshole that's really good to see.", "I'm so happy to hear about a story where the couple worked things out... It seems far to often people suggest divorce as the first step...  I hope you guys have 50 more years of blissful marriage.", "Or they may be in denial, even if it's not fully conscious, and even if it arises from not wanting to hurt others.\n\nI asked my ex to work on our communication issues and they refused. Things got worse. I then explained to my ex that what they did scared me, but then I was told I was \"too scared\".  Not feeling like your partner can respect your experiences and feelings really makes you feel like crap and like you're not going to be heard.\n\nNow I know that if someone doesn't want to work on things, I can't make them and I can't wait around and hope it gets better.", "(I'm sure you saw the comments above by now, but the contractor also agreed that their dude put it in a weird place and fixed it for free)", "... You mean the post that's an update on the post I mentioned? And you don't think that's relevant? Lol", "Exactly what I was thinking. Yes sometimes people go to divorce as advice too quickly, but honestly like 85% of the time when I see a bunch of people saying that it\u2019s because it\u2019s that bad. If it made it to this sub then we are already in the weeds a bit most of the time.", "[removed]", "The willingness to change and doing it shows that you are actually not an AH and seem to really love her. I am happy things have chanaged for the better and that you took the advice to heart even when a lot of it was probably quite harsh. Not everyone would take it all in and turn it into a positive. I wish you and your wife nothing but the best.", "You are NTA, ive read your original post, there was nothing wrong with it, if she wants to be your partner she needs to be accountable to everything, and not only when she succeeds. People are riding you, cause they dont know how much responsibility you have on your shoulders. Ho did you resolve those couple fights? In whose favor? You are getting molded into something you might not like, and into someone that your wife no longer will want. Remember - she married you for you in the first place.", "Wow so happy to hear that change is possible. Well done for being open-minded enough to look at yourself. Full of admiration for your courage (and your wife's) and humility.", "Wow, what a great update!", "This is one of the most heartwarming updates I've ever seen.   Well done for wanting to improve your communication & for putting in the time and work to do so", "This is a great update, glad for the two of you!", "Wow so happy to hear that change is possible. Well done for being open-minded enough to look at yourself. Full of admiration for your courage (and your wife's) and humility.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Weirdly people are often frustrated with TV characters", "And it shows he's a real man for sure and that he does really love her as much as he said he does. It makes me happy too.", "Granted 60% of the time I\u2019m yelling at tv or book characters.", "What a doormat. She stepped and walked all over you while making shitty decisions and making you wasted thousands. All while not working and making you work two shifts/jobs. And you accepted idiotic opinions from redditors and followed them. This whole situation is a joke. How about her making sure everything is done right? Too complicated.", "This should go on the Not Assholes Anymore subreddit!", "Figured I had to sort by controversial to find this question.", "what about the internet cable?", "Good on you!", "Thank you for realizing you really did scare her. I disassociate regularly because of extreme trauma. I wouldn\u2019t wish that on anyone.", "When my ex used to yell\nAt me and scare me I would go silent and for some reason imagine myself curled in a little ball being beaten with sticks. And get would get more mad at me for not being able to speak and going quiet \n\nDisassociating is a good word for it hadn\u2019t thought about it like that", "The only thing I care about is did the gutter get fixed to be in the right place?\n\nI have to withhold judgment until I get an answer.", "Good for you. Take an awesome person to admit their wrong and work to change. Most people don't want to admit this or not do the work. \n\nThanks for sharing and keep being awesome! Congratulations to both of you you've earned it\n\nAlso, what's that book again?", "Glad you have your mojos back. She\u2019s still an awful project manager though. She still never took ownership for that before you blew up. We all suck at certain things.\n\nYou really should have gotten to know each other and had a few more chats before marrying, but there are lessons here for everyone.", "Whatever. You're still trash and I still hope she leaves you. This isn't a happy update, this is a terrified abused woman trapped with an asshole.", "You are truly one of those people that refuse to support others just because you choose to stay stuck in 'oh poor me'. Grow the hell up.", "And how in the hell does this give support to a man that realized how important his spouse is to him. Go somewhere else with your 'poor me pitty bs' FFS", "it\u2019s irrelevant because i don\u2019t even know what would possess someone to say this. \n\nwhy are you adding unnecessary gender swap hypotheticals implying reverse sexism on this otherwise really nice post about a dude and his wife learning how to understand each other and communicate better? kinda feels like you\u2019re TA.", "It's not irrelevant simply because you don't understand it. I don't know or care what TA means.\n\nBye now", "Bad bot"]}
