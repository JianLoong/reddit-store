{"id": 11295, "submission_id": "11g62jx", "title": "UPDATE - AITA for telling my wife she's needs to be accountable for her actions?", "selftext": "I posted about five months ago about an argument my wife and I had, and I was determined to be the asshole. Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/xxc8uu/aita_for_telling_my_wife_shes_needs_to_be/). Recently someone commented on that post asking if my wife has left me yet, so I decided to update.\n\nA lot of people recognized that the way I spoke with my wife was full of frustration and anger, which was unproductive but even more than that, it was scary to my wife. [u/willoxash](https://www.reddit.com/u/willoxash/) had an excellent comment pointing out that I was just blowing off steam and that my priority should be my partnership.\n\nWe covered a lot of topics in the weeks following that incident. We had a couples therapy session to talk about strategies and communication. I saw one of my coworkers react in anger and frustration instead of taking the time to become calm and realized from the outside looking in just how unproductive his behavior was.\n\nAnd then my wife showed me a section of one of our self-help books. It's called The Five Personality Patterns and my therapist had recommended it to me a while back. We had been reading it together, my wife and I, but then we got busy and we stopped. She picked it back up after our fight and read about the \"leaving\" pattern. She underlined a bunch of sections and read them to me. And I finally understood.\n\nI grew up in a house where my parents screamed and yelled at each other or picked fights in order to storm out of the house, and that's how I used to interpret my wife's silence. As a way to \"win\" the fight. In reality, when she became silent, she was terrified. She wasn't stonewalling me, or trying to win the fight by manipulating me, or trying to avoid taking responsibility. She was so scared in that moment that she wasn't even in her body. She couldn't even speak, she was totally dissociated. She told me that even though she knows that how I was acting wasn't objectively scary, that her threshold for shutting down is really low.\n\nRealizing how much I scared my wife broke my heart. The descriptions of dissociation in the book were terrifying to me. My wife is the sweetest person, I love her so much and I never want her to experience what she experienced that day ever again. It changed my perspective completely.\n\nEver since my realization, our relationship is better than ever. We laugh and tease each other playfully. We have worked on projects together. We've talked about chores and money. We've even had a couple of fights and resolved them quickly and lovingly. Our communication is better because we trust each other. My wife told me that she has never felt safer or more loved now. I won't say I'm glad the fight happened, but what I realized because of it has been a turning point in our marriage for the better.", "created_utc": 1677772278, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11g62jx/update_aita_for_telling_my_wife_shes_needs_to_be/", "score": 87, "replies": ["THAT is an awesome update! Hugs to both of you for having the courage and love to work things out. You'll both be stronger for it.", "I want to recognize OP for being the kind of person who can actively look at themselves, hear criticism, understand what they did wrong, apologize, *and then* change that behavior.\n\nNot every partner would be that committed to their spouse, hell, not everyone would be that *respectful* to their spouse.\n\nIt sounds like you two are finding new adventures and joys in life together, your combined communication skills are to be applauded.\n\nHave a fantastic life.", "Great update! So many people have difficulty seeing how their actions impact others because they are caught in their own perspective. It's great that you talked with your wife and listened to her! Communicating can solve so many problems.", "Empathy and good communication makes EVERYTHING easier. I'm so glad you are both doing better!", "This makes me so happy...its heartbreaking when I read get a divorce as advice.\n\nMarriage is like a house...At first everything is shiney and brand new but over the years its lived in, worn out, and needs maintenance. Eventually you'll need a new roof...So what do you do? Buy a new house or repair your roof? If you buy a new house eventually you have the same issues with the new house because you never learned to repair your first house. Kudos for repairing your roof...(marriage). \n\nI can totally relate to the construction projects! We are almost finished with a $100k remodel of my backyard. I cannot tell you how many times I was asked something and totally gave the deer in the headlights look..They completely tore out my pool and moved it over several feet away from the poolhouse. When he asked me if I was happy with the pool placement...I didn't know what to say other than...You moved it over? Is that why you brought all of the dirt and filled it back up? I felt so stupid! I just said Okay cool...looks good to me. Fingers crossed my husband agrees because I have no idea what to look for!", "As someone who has a dissociative disorder, this update is really awesome and really important. Other's frustration/anger aren't my triggers (I have issues when I see others upset/sad/crying; my response to anger is fight, not flight), but when you're in that dissociated state it's so hard to put thoughts together as well. You are awesome for not only listening to your wife, but giving her the space to come to you with this and be willing to work on it with her. And especially for giving her time to explain her side, and for taking her seriously about the dissociation. That can honestly mean the world, so thank you.", "Thank you so much for the update and de5of how you got there.  This can help others like myself have better relationships.  Best to your family.\nBTW the books are currently free on Kindle Unlimited.", "OP I\u2019m so happy to read this. Well done for reflecting and growing.", "What a great update!!!\n\nSometimes, it just takes a little perspective."]}
