Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/xxc8uu/aita_for_telling_my_wife_shes_needs_to_be/). Recently someone commented on that post asking if my wife has left me yet, so I decided to update.\n\nA lot of people recognized that the way I spoke with my wife was full of frustration and anger, which was unproductive but even more than that, it was scary to my wife. [u/willoxash](https://www.reddit.com/u/willoxash/) had an excellent comment pointing out that I was just blowing off steam and that my priority should be my partnership.\n\nWe covered a lot of topics in the weeks following that incident. We had a couples therapy session to talk about strategies and communication. I saw one of my coworkers react in anger and frustration instead of taking the time to become calm and realized from the outside looking in just how unproductive his behavior was.\n\nAnd then my wife showed me a section of one of our self-help books. It's called The Five Personality Patterns and my therapist had recommended it to me a while back. We had been reading it together, my wife and I, but then we got busy and we stopped. She picked it back up after our fight and read about the \"leaving\" pattern. She underlined a bunch of sections and read them to me. And I finally understood.\n\nI grew up in a house where my parents screamed and yelled at each other or picked fights in order to storm out of the house, and that's how I used to interpret my wife's silence. As a way to \"win\" the fight. In reality, when she became silent, she was terrified. She wasn't stonewalling me, or trying to win the fight by manipulating me, or trying to avoid taking responsibility. She was so scared in that moment that she wasn't even in her body. She couldn't even speak, she was totally dissociated. She told me that even though she knows that how I was acting wasn't objectively scary, that her threshold for shutting down is really low.\n\nRealizing how much I scared my wife broke my heart. The descriptions of dissociation in the book were terrifying to me. My wife is the sweetest person, I love her so much and I never want her to experience what she experienced that day ever again. It changed my perspective completely.\n\nEver since my realization, our relationship is better than ever. We laugh and tease each other playfully. We have worked on projects together. We've talked about chores and money. We've even had a couple of fights and resolved them quickly and lovingly. Our communication is better because we trust each other. My wife told me that she has never felt safer or more loved now. I won't say I'm glad the fight happened, but what I realized because of it has been a turning point in our marriage for the better.", "created_utc": 1677772278, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11g62jx/update_aita_for_telling_my_wife_shes_needs_to_be/", "score": 1887, "replies": ["THAT is an awesome update! Hugs to both of you for having the courage and love to work things out. You'll both be stronger for it.", "I want to recognize OP for being the kind of person who can actively look at themselves, hear criticism, understand what they did wrong, apologize, *and then* change that behavior.\n\nNot every partner would be that committed to their spouse, hell, not everyone would be that *respectful* to their spouse.\n\nIt sounds like you two are finding new adventures and joys in life together, your combined communication skills are to be applauded.\n\nHave a fantastic life.", "Great update! So many people have difficulty seeing how their actions impact others because they are caught in their own perspective. It's great that you talked with your wife and listened to her! Communicating can solve so many problems.", "Empathy and good communication makes EVERYTHING easier. I'm so glad you are both doing better!", "This makes me so happy...its heartbreaking when I read get a divorce as advice.\n\nMarriage is like a house...At first everything is shiney and brand new but over the years its lived in, worn out, and needs maintenance. Eventually you'll need a new roof...So what do you do? Buy a new house or repair your roof? If you buy a new house eventually you have the same issues with the new house because you never learned to repair your first house. Kudos for repairing your roof...(marriage). \n\nI can totally relate to the construction projects! We are almost finished with a $100k remodel of my backyard. I cannot tell you how many times I was asked something and totally gave the deer in the headlights look..They completely tore out my pool and moved it over several feet away from the poolhouse. When he asked me if I was happy with the pool placement...I didn't know what to say other than...You moved it over? Is that why you brought all of the dirt and filled it back up? I felt so stupid! I just said Okay cool...looks good to me. Fingers crossed my husband agrees because I have no idea what to look for!", "As someone who has a dissociative disorder, this update is really awesome and really important. Other's frustration/anger aren't my triggers (I have issues when I see others upset/sad/crying; my response to anger is fight, not flight), but when you're in that dissociated state it's so hard to put thoughts together as well. You are awesome for not only listening to your wife, but giving her the space to come to you with this and be willing to work on it with her. And especially for giving her time to explain her side, and for taking her seriously about the dissociation. That can honestly mean the world, so thank you.", "Thank you so much for the update and de5of how you got there.  This can help others like myself have better relationships.  Best to your family.\nBTW the books are currently free on Kindle Unlimited.", "OP I\u2019m so happy to read this. Well done for reflecting and growing.", "What a great update!!!\n\nSometimes, it just takes a little perspective.", "INFO\n\nSure, sure, that's all great, but WHAT ABOUT THE DOWNSPOUT ISSUE?? Did that *ever* get resolved? /s", "They don\u2019t happen often enough, but updates from voted The Assholes who come back and update with completely new understanding and changed behavior are just the best.\n\nIt\u2019s honestly really like motivating and gives a lot of hope.", "What type of Reddit creep is going around commenting on posts that are 170 days old just looking to be a dick to OPs?", "You should post this to r/BORU. We need more wholesome posts. Good on you for listening and doing the work. This made me tear up.", "Ok but what about the fact that she keeps fucking your house up? lol where is the resolution of that?", "well OP I'm glad you fixed your mistake but she fixed hers about knowing how to communicate? I think that time it was an ESH and here we see how you change for the better, but what about your wife? Do I take into account your bad communication? It is useless for only one to fix their problems if the other maintains theirs.", "It's so refreshing to read a positive update. Good on ya!!\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude4c", "Awwwww. Good for you!", "I'm glad to hear you took a really good approach to this and that you guys are working on it. I think I'm going to buy the book you mentioned because that sounds dead on like me too.", "SOOOO happy for you both!

So nice to hear this!", "This is the most wholesome update I've ever seen. Good for you OP.", "Thank you for the update. It sounds like you have had some good personal growth since your last post. Keep up the good work!", "The world would be a better place if more people opened their ears and heart when interacting with others. That is what you ultimately did OP and I am so happy for you & your wife!", "GREAT update!! Good job to the both of you on working together!", "Congratulations for no longer being an AH. Seriously. When you're raised by people like that, it seems so normal, and it can be really hard to change.

I was like, but what about the downspout!? But I'm very happy for the great update!", "True but if the roof damage goes unfixed for too long, water seeps in and the house becomes toxic to live in. Not saying that happened here, and I think reddit is a bit too focused on \"get a divorce\" but sometimes that is the best answer", "Just because I was frustrated with the quality of the work done so far, doesn't mean she was fucking our house up. \n\nIn the end, she called the contractor and they fixed the gutter installation and fence gate at no charge. She personally fixed the marks on the house and we agreed to clean the sculpture in the spring.\n\nPart of what we learned is that when I would open up the conversation with anger, she would get defensive and we never got to a solution. By softening my approach, she wouldn't get defensive and we could talk about solutions together.", "Both my wife and I have been in therapy for a while now and she has been working on her communication with her therapist. All I can say is that she has told me that feeling safe with me makes her feel safe communicating more.", "After I read his original post...My first thought was Oh no not a reason to divorce and blow your life up. People can change and couples can learn to grow together. If marriage counseling didn't work for some it wouldn't exist. I think that's always the best option if both are willing to at least try. Even if its to know in their heart they did everything they could to keep their family together and then call it quits. But for many people that just isn't possible. Once contempt comes between two people and divorce is a topic in every fight...thats the point of no return. The relationship is done. It's encouraging to read these outcomes because they are so rare.", "I grew up in a similar household as you and luckily also had a partner patient enough to allow me to work through my communication issues. My brother, on the other hand, is also married to someone who grew up in the same type of house and neither of them has broken the pattern. \n\nI forgot this and set a boundary one day on vacation that led to me leaving the area and doing something else, specifically to avoid escalating my annoyance into anger (he was splashing me from the pool while I was reading lol). He took that as me silently storming off because that is how we grew up, and got super upset. I had to sit him down later and be like \" I'm not mad at you, I set a boundary by asking you to stop splashing me or else I would leave, you didn't stop so I left. I dislike feeling angry so if verbal communication isn't working, I remove myself from the situation because my emotional overreaction is no one else's problem to deal with.\"\n\n It was an ah-ha moment for him because literally no one in our family is capable of stopping the anger train lol Anyway I'm just mentioning that story because I find that (almost overly) communicating to my partner helps avoid any misconceptions. Like \"I am annoyed at what you said but I'm not laying down in bed sulking, I just need space and time to process my own reaction to what you said; I'm not angry at you\". It's not a perfect system by any means but it helps me control and reduce the effect my anger has on others.", "The good ending", "wonderful update, communication is everything.", "Look at this sub curing  AH's!", "This is an awesome update!

The fact that you were receptive to feedback and wanted to change is a HUGE deal. I congratulate you and I wish you a very happy marriage :D", "Good for you op, that kind of realization can be hard. I'm glad you're working to improve and that both of you are working on your marriage together now.", "Blows my mind that mature adults only see a way out instead of room to grow. Good job.", "Love to hear this. I, too, grew up in a yelling and screaming household. As a direct result, not only did I become a yeller, but I chose bad relationships with people who were also abusive in various ways - verbally, emotionally, and even physically. It takes a lot of introspection to recognize our own contributions to these problems and take steps to change them. Good on you!", "this is one of my favorite updates\n\ngood job OP, you actually solved the issue instead of breaking up like most people on reddit would suggest", "If I came home and everything I paid for and wanted done correctly was basically shit I would be PISSED!!   With yelling or not you are a perfectionist, she's a DIYer... that is doomed for me.", "There is nothing more courageous than saying, \"I'm wrong and I will fix it\". Bravo to you.", "So happy that things have improved.  Keep working on your relationship.  Keep communicating with each other.", "I recently celebrated my 27th wedding anniversary and the top two things that have gotten us through the years are, being able to admit you fucked up and be willing to say you\u2019re sorry and being able to communicate with each other in a healthy way.

I am so glad for both of you.  Good luck as you move forward together.", "relationships take a lot of work, glad you found your answers on how to work on yours, first steps are realizing a problem, getting told you are the asshole can sometimes be a good first step if presenting the thing to 'impartial' outside people, and if you take it to heart and start taking the steps needed.  Too many people turn into monsters instead, never realizing what they are doing.  You would have lost her eventually, but maybe not now.  Keep up the good work yo.", "I love this.

It was hard and there was shouting and tears, and at the end of it, whoo boy did we walk away knowing so much more about each other. It made all the difference.", "I'm so happy for you. This reminds me so much of my dad. He used to scream at my mom all the time and was full of anger. When I was little I was afraid of him too. It took him a lot longer to realize he needed to change, he didn't have Reddit to give him a wakeup call and it's been a lifelong process for him, but he's gotten so much better and I'm proud of him, and I'm proud of you.", "What a wonderful and wholesome update. I give you huge props for beeing able to see fault and change yourself. Its certainly not an easy thing to do and not everyone can do that.", "Not every partner truly loves their spouse.

It needs to be added to \u2018not the asshole anymore\u2019.", "Aww Good for you!", "I say this all the time. Granted 60% of the time I\u2019m yelling at tv or book characters.

At least it was the bread and butter of 90s sitcoms lol. Weirdly people are often frustrated with TV characters but can't apply it to their own lives.", "THX.

If you fixed the roof when it started leaking, you wouldn't get damaged walls and mold. It's a matter of recognizing the issues in time and actually fixing them rather than letting them compound to the point they can't be fixed.

My niece took forever to verbalize why she was feeling hurt in the first place. We gently went round and round about why for a good 5-6 minutes before she was able to tell me why she had decided not to be friends anymore. Granted at age 11 I terminated a friendship by kicking a kid in the balls when he tried to hug me after I said no soooo she\u2019s doing better than I was at her age!"]}
