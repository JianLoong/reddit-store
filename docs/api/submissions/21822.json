The way OP is describing it (\"She was the person keeping my dad away my entire life\") makes absolutely no sense coming from an adult. I'd understand if OP were a child, but at 25 they should stop thinking of their father as some kind of puppet with his wife pulling the strings. He's a grown man who has been making his own decisions since before OP was born. Also: moving to a country with better (and more affordable) healthcare AND where the mother of a sick child has a support network makes a lot of sense (especially since she's likely to be the main caregiver, considering her husband's job involves a lot of travel). OP's father was an AH for not telling OP before he decided to move, and letting them waste time looking for houses nearby.
