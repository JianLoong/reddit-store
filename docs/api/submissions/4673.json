I wasn't going to do anything about it because I figured there was no way it was true, but I made the mistake of telling a friend that likes that sort of stuff, who convinced me that we should report it to the police anonymously just to see if we were right. \n\nIt turned out that we were right, but we didn't know until almost three weeks after our report, when the people committing the crime were arrested, one of who was my girlfriend. \n\nAt the time I didn't know why, but I wasn't allowed to see her or call her when she was in jail and I wasn't allowed to attend her hearing or court either. I could only stand outside and wait for her transfer. It was such a confusing time that I hadn't even linked my report to her crime at first because it happened weeks apart and my mind was not in the right place.\n\nFYI, we do not live in our home countries. Where we live now, her months added up to just over 2 years, but at the end of her sentence she will have to be deported. In her home country however she could have gotten up to 10 years plus she would have had to pay however much she earns in 2 years.  \n\nMy only chance to speak with her  was after she had been taken to prison, by phone or by visiting. She didn't call even though she had my number but she did accept my request to get on her visit list. \n\nI went to see her for the first time over a week ago. She wasn't happy to see me. \n\nWhen I asked her if there were maybe issues with the phones because she hadn't called me, she called me stupid for thinking so. \nShe told me that the reason I couldn't attend court or get in contact with her before was because she had blacklisted me. And when she had been transferred, she just didn't want to call \"the guy who got her into prison.\"\n\nThat was when it was finally confirmed that it had in fact been me who got her into prison. It had been one of her girlfriends who told her (before her arrest) that me and my friend reported some crime what she thought was \"as a joke.\" \n\nShe blamed me for forcing her to lose two years of her life, and the life she had built in this country. \n\nDespite everything she had said, I couldn't bring myself to be angry at her because I entirely agreed with her. I apologized repeatedly. I told her it was in fact my fault. I asked her to forgive me. \n\nBut now I've been able to think about it rationally without my mind being clouded. I'm starting to believe that I am not at fault here, but it feels awful to admit that. \n\nAm I really the asshole here, or is am I part of the blame?", "created_utc": 1670965237, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zl6szn/aita_for_getting_my_girlfriend_into_prison_by/", "score": 88, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If she had shown remorse for her actions and behavior, and exhibited a genuine desire to provide restitution, serve her sentence, and make sincere personal changes, I don't think you necessarily should have ended things or that she's a bad person.

You\u2019re NTA, but was this money laundering affecting you?", "Unfortunately it's probably true. And what happens if it escalates? She gets involved with bad people and puts your safety at risk?

Do you all just hear that someone broke the law and immediately side against them?", "you should have made that more clear in the post", "Haha absolutely not, I read the comments to figure out what the crime was for this very reason. My verdict depends on the crime. I hear that someone laundered money and that crime is severe enough for me to decide that it was worth reporting. Plus the girlfriend is gaslighting OP. \n\n\nShe made her bed, now she has to lay in it.", "I really don't think the crime matters in this situation, that's why originally I chose not to mention it. The point was that it had been her and I didn't know. Even if it had been something much much worse, but I knew it was her, I wouldn't have reported it.", "What exactly do you consider to be gaslighting about her behavior? Even if you fully consider her to be in the wrong that doesnt change the fact that her anger isn't lying or a manipulation tactic. She just knows he ratted her out for something multiple people have easily gotten away with, and if you were in her shoes you'd be angry at him too for not just keeping his mouth shut", "The crime does matter if that's part of the story. The comments are full of people ready to pounce on this woman when all they know about her is what you told them. People are incredibly quick to dismiss the lives of anyone they deem a criminal because that is one of the few classes of people left that it is still somewhat socially acceptable to dehumanize. You are being irresponsible for the sake of having your ego stroked."]}
