Bluey is really annoying and he misbehaved a lot, but I love him, and so does my daughter. He is a young dog (around 2), so I expect him to mature as he ages, and he has separation anxiety. I work full time, so my dog is at home when I am at work. My neighbor does not like my dog and says he is impacting her mental health. She is disabled, so she doesn\u2019t work, and she does have to deal with my dog a lot. He keeps trying to escape when I leave (I leave him in the yard), and I\u2019ve tried several things to keeps him in, including little fences inside my main fenced in yard, but he somehow escapes. I will leave him inside a lot, but he makes a huge mess, so I\u2019ve been trying different techniques to allow him to stay outside. When he gets out, she puts him back in the fence. I\u2019m really grateful for her for that! \nMy neighbor talked to me about her frustration with him and I mentioned that I had considered rehoming him. He does a lot of things that are hard to deal with, like peeing on my bed, and I told her about this. She said she had someone that would want him if I rehomed him. I thanked her and said I would think about it. \nUltimately, I decided not to rehome him and just spent about $500 on a heavy duty fence with a top to keep him in throughout the day. I also got an AirTag for him to try and keep up with him, and I took him to the vet for anxiety medicine. He has only taken it one day, but it helped with his separation anxiety and yappiness. \nMy neighbor mentioned to me again that she would give me the person\u2019s number to rehome him and mentioned that he is affecting her. Am I being the asshole for wanting to keep my dog? He is a nuisance, but I love him.\n\nUpdate: y\u2019all are ripping me a new booty hole, and that\u2019s fine. I work from 7-3 because I am an educator. Children cannot walk my dog because I am with the children. I know I\u2019m a shitty dog mom; that\u2019s why I\u2019m reaching out. I\u2019ve obviously TRIED to talk to someone because that\u2019s how he got on meds at the vet. I asked what I should do and the vet said try medicine. I never thought of training and that on me, 100%. I am literally contacting someone about training right now. I don\u2019t exactly know how to entertain a dog while I am at work, but I am actively doing research. I prefer not to throw out perfectly good animals when I just need improvement. So I\u2019m working on it, I love my new asshole, and thank you for your time.\n\nI did not adopt this dog. My ex husband adopted the dog after I had our child. I did not ask for the dog, and I did not plan for it. The dog was his baby, he worked with him, and I just hung out with him and fed him. My ex husband left the dog when he moved out.

You need to train the dog- crate train, dog obedience school, etc.. and if you don\u2019t, your neighbor is right, rehome the dog. If training doesn\u2019t work, you could look into doggy daycares. \n\nThere is no reason your neighbor should be impacted by your dog in a consistent basis", "YTA. When a person chooses to become a dog owner, they take on responsibilities of appropriate care. This includes training, maintaining an appropriate environment, and ensuring the dog\u2019s needs are being fully met. These needs go well beyond food, water and housing. They include providing appropriate stimulation, addressing behavioral challenges, taking steps to ensure your dog is fulfilled while minimizing impacts to others, etc. You\u2019ve become a dog owner but have not fully taken in these responsibilities. You have permitted your dog to engage in behaviors that are problematic to you and to neighbors. It seems you are not taking steps to address these behaviors through training and environmental change. You are expecting everyone else to deal with the effects of your inaction. Get your dog training. Board your dog during the day, or work with an in home dog sitter/walker to provide care while you are at work so your dog can be left indoors. Take steps to address behavioral issues. If you cannot commit to these things, you are not in the best position to be this dog\u2019s owner. The loving thing to do would be to rehome the dog with an owner who can fully commit to meeting this animal\u2019s needs.", "YTA\n\nYour dog is barking all day, escaping the fence and getting into your neighbor's yard. He's two years old. This is not something he's going to grow out of. You need to fix his environment so that he can't escape, keep him indoors, or arrange it so he has entertainment during the hours that you aren't at home (a dog walking service, doggie daycare, something.) You leaving him outside is transferring the annoyance of him messing up the inside of your house onto your neighbor, who then has to deal with your dog. It's YOUR DOG and your problem to deal with. \n\nIf you are unwilling to take measures to make sure your dog is contained in the yard where he can't escape, take him to doggie daycare, or get him properly trained, then yes, you should rehome him.

YTA for misleading your neighbor, and allowing your dog to generally be a nuisance.", "YTA for getting a dog in the first place when you weren\u2019t prepared to train and properly care for him. YTA for allowing him to impact your neighbor in this way for any period of time. If you\u2019re *not* going to rehome him, you need to start treating his training like it\u2019s your biggest priority in life. You need to stop leaving him outside for your neighbor to deal with. Who cares if he makes a mess in your home\u2014 it\u2019s your responsibility to clean up, not your disabled neighbors\u2019 job to chase your dog back into the yard.\n\nHonestly the more I think about it the more I think you should rehome and never get a pet again. Your dog has been at constant risk of being hit by a car because of your negligence, and you don\u2019t seem to get what a big deal it is at all.", "YTA for being a bad pet owner.  Bluey doesn't need medication, both he and you need training.  Petsmart offers it at a very reasonable price.  One thing you can do is get a cheap T-shirt and wear it over a weekend and put is in Bluey's kennel Monday morning.  When I was training my  dog, that would call him down a lot if I had to leave.", "Def NTA for wanting to keep your dog. But YTA for the evident lack of training early on, as it's now inconveniencing your neighbors. People tend to forget that dogs require deep deep training in order to be the best companions, and it doesn't just magically happen.\n\nAs I mentioned, issue may be you didn't train the dog early on enough, so now training will be more difficult, especially since he's almost out of the younger, puppy-like age.\n\nIf you're able, I recommend getting him professionally trained, either at home or taking him to a center. At home, you can train him using a stern voice, treats, and crate training. Crate training was a LIFE SAVER when I trained my lab. He would frequently pee and poop everywhere, and whenever we saw signs of him about to do it or actually doing it, we would put him in his crate so he would, overtime, acknowledge that as his timeout space. We also have a second crate as a \"leaving for a bit, will be back\" crate. He knows the difference now. Also, do get a better fence. It costs money, but that's what comes with getting a dog. It's your job to keep him secure, not rely on your neighbors for that support (even if it is kind of them to do so).\n\nIt's gonna be hard cause you do work FT. But use some methods I mentioned, as well as any others people mention, and implement them in increments to see what works best.\n\nIf you can't see yourself dedicating ample time though, rehome it now that it's still young. And make sure the new owner will properly train it and care for it.", "N T A for wanting to keep your dog.\n\nMASSIVELY YTA for failing to train or care for him properly. He won't just \"grow out of it.\" Dogs have to be trained", "YTA not for not wanting to rehome your dog but for being an awful owner. I'm glad you've finally started to actually manage blueys issues but the way you talk about them is as if they're just little things and not potentially fatal. If he escapes so often all sorts of things could happen to him, and honestly it's not your neighbors job to keep catching him after he escapes. If it was me I would have brought him to the local shelter after so many escapes. Not to mention that anxiety like that causes a lot of stress on dogs and can shorten their life span. The making a mess (which means he could eat something that causes a blockage and requires major surgery to remove) when left inside and peeing on your bed are all behaviours that can be trained out of a dog with time. You could also put him in doggy daycare so you know he's safe and cared for and not alone. Also 2 years is plenty old enough to mature, these behaviors aren't because he's still a puppy but from lack of training and likely neglect on your part. If it took you this long to secure your fence so your dog doesn't escape constantly I am genuinely concerned your backyard doesn't have any of the other requirements to safely keep a dog outside all day, mainly shelter/shade and enough water, could other animals get in your yard and hurt bluey? Does being outside cause bluey more stress? Are these things you've thought about? If you can't provide these basics then you shouldn't own a dog.\n\nI'm not trying to be mean, but these are the realities of owning a dog and sadly as a volunteer at a dog shelter I see way too many cases of accidental neglect (letting your dog escape so often before ever actually doing anything about it is a big red flag!)\n\nYappy dogs are gonna yap, but you are definitely aggravating it with all these other things.", "YTA- you don\u2019t have the lifestyle to adequately support this dog\u2019s needs. \n\nMany dogs cannot be left home alone all day, and will make a mess out of the house if they are home alone, bored, lonely and anxious. In addition to anti-anxiety meds- dogs like this need to be exercised before you leave, need training so you can change their behavior chains that triggers anxiety, and need a mid-day play break. \n\nJust keeping them outside alone and bored while you work is not working for this animal. Either change your patterns with him, or rehome the dog with someone who can give him what he needs.", "YTA. For being an irresponsible pet owner. For (according to your own comments) not having looked into training him before you got him?!? For leaving him outside in an unsecured yard all day. For expecting him to _mature_ without training or training intervention for his separation anxiety.\n\nDogs are wonderful but they are an enormous responsibility that you clearly didn't think through. You shouldn't be leaving a dog alone for 8+ hours every day, it needs a walker or ideally daycare. If you can't afford this you frankly shouldn't have gotten the dog. Bluey and your neighbour both deserve better than you.", "Definitely look into training your dog (yes, small dogs can be trained!!) and make sure there\u2019s an adequate shelter if you\u2019re leaving your dog outside all day. Going to say YTA for now, since you should\u2019ve been training him since the day you got him, and this noise issue was completely preventable. NTA for not rehoming him, however. For dog training, look into local dog trainers, youtube videos, and dog training guides online.", "YTA for not training your dog, but not one for wanting to keep him. Why isn\u2019t he in a crate during the day?

You need to crate train him for starters.", "YTA for not training your dog, it sure sounds like he'd be better off rehomed. Seperation anxiety if its REAL SA doesn't just disappear as they mature. Anxiety meds don't magically mean you can leave him for long periods without issues you still need to put in the work. \n\n He escapes from the yard because he's stressed and unhappy when you leave, same reason why he trashes your house.

Pets are a lot of work and if you can't or aren't  willing to do the work, don't have them.", "YTA. Your poor neighbour is suffering because of your inability to keep the dog controlled. You dont put the dog inside your home because its destructive, so you decide to transfer the problem to your disabled neighbour? Only love isnt enough. Also, it doesnt justify letting the dog become a problem for others. You shouldnt have gotten the dog if you work for such long hours and dont have resources such as daycare, dog sitters/walkers, etc. Its also unfair to the dog. If you cant find a solution to this, rehoming will be the most reasonable option for everyone.", "YTA. You\u2019re teaching him bad behaviors. You should really look into crate training. It\u2019s not a bad thing. My dog is crate trained and we worked with her to love it, so it\u2019s one of her safe spaces that she goes when things bother her (like thunder). You\u2019re being an irresponsible dog owner. Your dog won\u2019t grow out of bad behaviors. You have to work with them. If you can\u2019t find a trainer, look online. There\u2019s great resources on YouTube from professional trainers, and there\u2019s even people who do virtual classes with you.\n\n\nEdit: it\u2019s not always about keeping them entertained while you\u2019re at work,  but doing different activities while you are with them too. There\u2019s a ton of great mental stimulation activities for dogs you can research. And simple things like working on commands is great for them. And leaving them things, if they do get bored, and destructive. . My dog honestly just sleeps and barks at the mailman when I\u2019m gone. (I had a camera when I first got her just to make sure she was okay when I left)", "YTA for not training your dog for two years. Dogs don't just grow out of it, they need to be taught how to behave. Do your damn job or re-home the dog to someone who will.", "YTA\n\nRehome the dog. You obviously don't know what you're doing and you're making everyone, including Bluey miserable!", "Doggy daycare and training.", "NTA for loving your dog but YTA for your not being able to train the dog better\u2026\n\nYour neighbor should not have to be made to put your own dog back over the fence when again, he\u2019s yours not hers.\n\n\u2018Either spend some additional money on some good training or seriously consider rehoming\u2026 \n\nOf course you love your dog but if you\u2019re unable to truly take care of him in a way that he clearly needs, the best and most loving thing you can do is give him to a household that can\u2026", "YTA. At 2 not train very well age won't fix that. Invest in a good one on one trainer. Try the invisible fence. Where I live lots of walkers and deer. You never see a strays or one chasing a deer. Very few real fences due to wildlife.", "YTA. Not for not wanting to rehome. But for not training your dog. I worked from 8-6 when I first got mine and still managed to do it. Don't get the dog if you won't put in the work. It's not just about the fun times", "YTA for not researching dog ownership first, BUT, big kuddos to taking it on the chin and searching out answers.  \n\nWhen you talk to trainers, make sure you understand and are comfortable with their techniques.  Different  trainers have different techniques and you may be uncomfortable with those techniques.  For example, I was working with a trainer because the BestusBoyEvah was a rescue and when it came to me, or our house, he was kind of aggressive because of PTSD.   The trainer had me stand at my open door and had someone come up behind me.  BestustBoyEvah lunged.  The trainer quickly fixed the leash so that BBE was on his hind legs pawing the air and counted to ten. Yeah, I was upset.  Found another trainer that worked with easing him into social situations with kindness and support.\n\nSo ask a lot of questions, to make sure you guys are on the same page.  They should be willing to listen to your expected outcomes.  In fact they should ask what your goals are. It is not too late.\n\nAlso, I have a doodle that absolutely had to go to doggy day care because he was so active.  There was a sea change in his behavior at home after that.  He does not go everyday, but it gets that energy out in a healthy manner, and also teaches socialization.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Would you say oh don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m sure it will be fine. Or research how to solve the problem! Your dog deserves better", "I\u2019m not taking things too seriously. I work in rescue. I\u2019m the one who has to deal with the aftermath of animals like yours and people like you. \n\nI\u2019m not going to feel bad for being honest and telling you the reality of that. But, you\u2019ve made it very clear that you have not in fact learned anything. I hope you never get another pet again. They deserve better than you. \n\nAnd don\u2019t give me this bullshit about how you tried so much and just couldn\u2019t afford training until now. You said yourself in another comment that the idea of training literally didn\u2019t even occur to you. I get that you\u2019re feeling shitty because people are telling you how shitty you are and you can\u2019t handle the reality of accepting and taking accountability for your actions. But that\u2019s a you problem. \n\nAnd here the thing \u201cbabe\u201d. Maybe I am being to serious. But the worst thing that happens if I\u2019m too serious is I maybe hurt some feelings while I  educate people. The worst thing that happens when people aren\u2019t serious enough about animals is they die. But obviously you don\u2019t seem to care about the reality of that cause it hurts your poor feelings.", "Because teachers should know everything without help.", "Country tells you basically nothing and plenty of people want basic privacy on the internet.", "They should know how to do basic research, yeah.", "No, because you should have a basic understanding of how to find answers to basic questions. Knowing how to learn is more important than what you already know. \n\nYour attitude sucks."]}
