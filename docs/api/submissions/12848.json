Bluey is really annoying and he misbehaved a lot, but I love him, and so does my daughter. He is a young dog (around 2), so I expect him to mature as he ages, and he has separation anxiety. I work full time, so my dog is at home when I am at work. My neighbor does not like my dog and says he is impacting her mental health. She is disabled, so she doesn\u2019t work, and she does have to deal with my dog a lot. He keeps trying to escape when I leave (I leave him in the yard), and I\u2019ve tried several things to keeps him in, including little fences inside my main fenced in yard, but he somehow escapes. I will leave him inside a lot, but he makes a huge mess, so I\u2019ve been trying different techniques to allow him to stay outside. When he gets out, she puts him back in the fence. I\u2019m really grateful for her for that! \nMy neighbor talked to me about her frustration with him and I mentioned that I had considered rehoming him. He does a lot of things that are hard to deal with, like peeing on my bed, and I told her about this. She said she had someone that would want him if I rehomed him. I thanked her and said I would think about it. \nUltimately, I decided not to rehome him and just spent about $500 on a heavy duty fence with a top to keep him in throughout the day. I also got an AirTag for him to try and keep up with him, and I took him to the vet for anxiety medicine. He has only taken it one day, but it helped with his separation anxiety and yappiness. \nMy neighbor mentioned to me again that she would give me the person\u2019s number to rehome him and mentioned that he is affecting her. Am I being the asshole for wanting to keep my dog? He is a nuisance, but I love him.\n\nUpdate: y\u2019all are ripping me a new booty hole, and that\u2019s fine. I work from 7-3 because I am an educator. Children cannot walk my dog because I am with the children. I know I\u2019m a shitty dog mom; that\u2019s why I\u2019m reaching out. I\u2019ve obviously TRIED to talk to someone because that\u2019s how he got on meds at the vet. I asked what I should do and the vet said try medicine. I never thought of training and that on me, 100%. I am literally contacting someone about training right now. I don\u2019t exactly know how to entertain a dog while I am at work, but I am actively doing research. I prefer not to throw out perfectly good animals when I just need improvement.

You need to train the dog- crate train, dog obedience school, etc.. and if you don\u2019t, your neighbor is right, rehome the dog. If training doesn\u2019t work, you could look into doggy daycares. \n\nThere is no reason your neighbor should be impacted by your dog in a consistent basis", "YTA. When a person chooses to become a dog owner, they take on responsibilities of appropriate care. This includes training, maintaining an appropriate environment, and ensuring the dog\u2019s needs are being fully met. These needs go well beyond food, water and housing. They include providing appropriate stimulation, addressing behavioral challenges, taking steps to ensure your dog is fulfilled while minimizing impacts to others, etc. You\u2019ve become a dog owner but have not fully taken in these responsibilities. You have permitted your dog to engage in behaviors that are problematic to you and to neighbors. It seems you are not taking steps to address these behaviors through training and environmental change. You are expecting everyone else to deal with the effects of your inaction. Get your dog training. Board your dog during the day, or work with an in home dog sitter/walker to provide care while you are at work so your dog can be left indoors. Take steps to address behavioral issues. If you cannot commit to these things, you are not in the best position to be this dog\u2019s owner. The loving thing to do would be to rehome the dog with an owner who can fully commit to meeting this animal\u2019s needs.", "YTA\n\nYour dog is barking all day, escaping the fence and getting into your neighbor's yard. He's two years old. This is not something he's going to grow out of. You need to fix his environment so that he can't escape, keep him indoors, or arrange it so he has entertainment during the hours that you aren't at home (a dog walking service, doggie daycare, something.) You leaving him outside is transferring the annoyance of him messing up the inside of your house onto your neighbor, who then has to deal with your dog. It's YOUR DOG and your problem to deal with. \n\nIf you are unwilling to take measures to make sure your dog is contained in the yard where he can't escape, take him to doggie daycare, or get him properly trained, then yes, you should rehome him.

YTA for misleading your neighbor, and allowing your dog to generally be a nuisance.", "YTA for getting a dog in the first place when you weren\u2019t prepared to train and properly care for him. YTA for allowing him to impact your neighbor in this way for any period of time. If you\u2019re *not* going to rehome him, you need to start treating his training like it\u2019s your biggest priority in life. You need to stop leaving him outside for your neighbor to deal with. Who cares if he makes a mess in your home\u2014 it\u2019s your responsibility to clean up, not your disabled neighbors\u2019 job to chase your dog back into the yard.\n\nHonestly the more I think about it the more I think you should rehome and never get a pet again. Your dog has been at constant risk of being hit by a car because of your negligence, and you don\u2019t seem to get what a big deal it is at all.", "YTA for being a bad pet owner.  Bluey doesn't need medication, both he and you need training.  Petsmart offers it at a very reasonable price.  One thing you can do is get a cheap T-shirt and wear it over a weekend and put is in Bluey's kennel Monday morning.  When I was training my  dog, that would call him down a lot if I had to leave.", "Def NTA for wanting to keep your dog. But YTA for the evident lack of training early on, as it's now inconveniencing your neighbors. People tend to forget that dogs require deep deep training in order to be the best companions, and it doesn't just magically happen.\n\nAs I mentioned, issue may be you didn't train the dog early on enough, so now training will be more difficult, especially since he's almost out of the younger, puppy-like age.\n\nIf you're able, I recommend getting him professionally trained, either at home or taking him to a center. At home, you can train him using a stern voice, treats, and crate training. Crate training was a LIFE SAVER when I trained my lab. He would frequently pee and poop everywhere, and whenever we saw signs of him about to do it or actually doing it, we would put him in his crate so he would, overtime, acknowledge that as his timeout space. We also have a second crate as a \"leaving for a bit, will be back\" crate. He knows the difference now. Also, do get a better fence. It costs money, but that's what comes with getting a dog. It's your job to keep him secure, not rely on your neighbors for that support (even if it is kind of them to do so).\n\nIt's gonna be hard cause you do work FT. But use some methods I mentioned, as well as any others people mention, and implement them in increments to see what works best.\n\nIf you can't see yourself dedicating ample time though, rehome it now that it's still young. And make sure the new owner will properly train it and care for it.", "N T A for wanting to keep your dog.\n\nMASSIVELY YTA for failing to train or care for him properly. He won't just \"grow out of it.\" Dogs have to be trained", "YTA not for not wanting to rehome your dog but for being an awful owner. I'm glad you've finally started to actually manage blueys issues but the way you talk about them is as if they're just little things and not potentially fatal. If he escapes so often all sorts of things could happen to him, and honestly it's not your neighbors job to keep catching him after he escapes. If it was me I would have brought him to the local shelter after so many escapes. Not to mention that anxiety like that causes a lot of stress on dogs and can shorten their life span. The making a mess (which means he could eat something that causes a blockage and requires major surgery to remove) when left inside and peeing on your bed are all behaviours that can be trained out of a dog with time. You could also put him in doggy daycare so you know he's safe and cared for and not alone. Also 2 years is plenty old enough to mature, these behaviors aren't because he's still a puppy but from lack of training and likely neglect on your part. If it took you this long to secure your fence so your dog doesn't escape constantly I am genuinely concerned your backyard doesn't have any of the other requirements to safely keep a dog outside all day, mainly shelter/shade and enough water, could other animals get in your yard and hurt bluey? Does being outside cause bluey more stress? Are these things you've thought about? If you can't provide these basics then you shouldn't own a dog.\n\nI'm not trying to be mean, but these are the realities of owning a dog and sadly as a volunteer at a dog shelter I see way too many cases of accidental neglect (letting your dog escape so often before ever actually doing anything about it is a big red flag!)\n\nYappy dogs are gonna yap, but you are definitely aggravating it with all these other things.", "YTA- you don\u2019t have the lifestyle to adequately support this dog\u2019s needs. \n\nMany dogs cannot be left home alone all day, and will make a mess out of the house if they are home alone, bored, lonely and anxious. In addition to anti-anxiety meds- dogs like this need to be exercised before you leave, need training so you can change their behavior chains that triggers anxiety, and need a mid-day play break. \n\nJust keeping them outside alone and bored while you work is not working for this animal. Either change your patterns with him, or rehome the dog with someone who can give him what he needs.", "YTA. For being an irresponsible pet owner. For (according to your own comments) not having looked into training him before you got him?!? For leaving him outside in an unsecured yard all day. For expecting him to _mature_ without training or training intervention for his separation anxiety.\n\nDogs are wonderful but they are an enormous responsibility that you clearly didn't think through. You shouldn't be leaving a dog alone for 8+ hours every day, it needs a walker or ideally daycare. If you can't afford this you frankly shouldn't have gotten the dog. Bluey and your neighbour both deserve better than you.", "Definitely look into training your dog (yes, small dogs can be trained!!) and make sure there\u2019s an adequate shelter if you\u2019re leaving your dog outside all day. Going to say YTA for now, since you should\u2019ve been training him since the day you got him, and this noise issue was completely preventable. NTA for not rehoming him, however. For dog training, look into local dog trainers, youtube videos, and dog training guides online.", "YTA for not training your dog, but not one for wanting to keep him. Why isn\u2019t he in a crate during the day?

You need to crate train him for starters.", "YTA for not training your dog, it sure sounds like he'd be better off rehomed. Seperation anxiety if its REAL SA doesn't just disappear as they mature. Anxiety meds don't magically mean you can leave him for long periods without issues you still need to put in the work. \n\n He escapes from the yard because he's stressed and unhappy when you leave, same reason why he trashes your house.

Pets are a lot of work and if you can't or aren't  willing to do the work, don't have them.", "YTA. Your poor neighbour is suffering because of your inability to keep the dog controlled. You dont put the dog inside your home because its destructive, so you decide to transfer the problem to your disabled neighbour? Only love isnt enough. Also, it doesnt justify letting the dog become a problem for others. You shouldnt have gotten the dog if you work for such long hours and dont have resources such as daycare, dog sitters/walkers, etc. Its also unfair to the dog. If you cant find a solution to this, rehoming will be the most reasonable option for everyone.", "YTA. You\u2019re teaching him bad behaviors. You should really look into crate training. It\u2019s not a bad thing. My dog is crate trained and we worked with her to love it, so it\u2019s one of her safe spaces that she goes when things bother her (like thunder). You\u2019re being an irresponsible dog owner. Your dog won\u2019t grow out of bad behaviors. You have to work with them. If you can\u2019t find a trainer, look online. There\u2019s great resources on YouTube from professional trainers, and there\u2019s even people who do virtual classes with you.\n\n\nEdit: it\u2019s not always about keeping them entertained while you\u2019re at work,  but doing different activities while you are with them too. There\u2019s a ton of great mental stimulation activities for dogs you can research. And simple things like working on commands is great for them. And leaving them things, if they do get bored, and destructive. . My dog honestly just sleeps and barks at the mailman when I\u2019m gone. (I had a camera when I first got her just to make sure she was okay when I left)", "YTA for not training your dog for two years. Dogs don't just grow out of it, they need to be taught how to behave. Do your damn job or re-home the dog to someone who will.", "YTA\n\nRehome the dog. You obviously don't know what you're doing and you're making everyone, including Bluey miserable!", "Doggy daycare and training.", "NTA for loving your dog but YTA for your not being able to train the dog better\u2026\n\nYour neighbor should not have to be made to put your own dog back over the fence when again, he\u2019s yours not hers.\n\n\u2018Either spend some additional money on some good training or seriously consider rehoming\u2026 \n\nOf course you love your dog but if you\u2019re unable to truly take care of him in a way that he clearly needs, the best and most loving thing you can do is give him to a household that can\u2026", "YTA. At 2 not train very well age won't fix that. Invest in a good one on one trainer. Try the invisible fence. Where I live lots of walkers and deer. You never see a strays or one chasing a deer. Very few real fences due to wildlife.", "YTA. Not for not wanting to rehome. But for not training your dog. I worked from 8-6 when I first got mine and still managed to do it. Don't get the dog if you won't put in the work. It's not just about the fun times", "YTA for not researching dog ownership first, BUT, big kuddos to taking it on the chin and searching out answers.  \n\nWhen you talk to trainers, make sure you understand and are comfortable with their techniques.  Different  trainers have different techniques and you may be uncomfortable with those techniques.  For example, I was working with a trainer because the BestusBoyEvah was a rescue and when it came to me, or our house, he was kind of aggressive because of PTSD.   The trainer had me stand at my open door and had someone come up behind me.  BestustBoyEvah lunged.  The trainer quickly fixed the leash so that BBE was on his hind legs pawing the air and counted to ten. Yeah, I was upset.  Found another trainer that worked with easing him into social situations with kindness and support.\n\nSo ask a lot of questions, to make sure you guys are on the same page.  They should be willing to listen to your expected outcomes.  In fact they should ask what your goals are. It is not too late.\n\nAlso, I have a doodle that absolutely had to go to doggy day care because he was so active.  There was a sea change in his behavior at home after that.  He does not go everyday, but it gets that energy out in a healthy manner, and also teaches socialization.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Yes, the dog is a nuisance inside. This can change with age, but not if you don't put in the effort. Train the dog to want to be outside for playtime and potty. Close doors you don't want him in.

I am assuming he whines a lot when you are gone due to separation anxiety. \n\nDo your dog a favour and rehome him. If you insist in keeping him: do your homework yourself about training him instead of asking that here.", "How tf did you get a dog with 0 realization that they need to be trained? I mean did you not spend 5 minutes looking into what a responsible dog owner needs to do before getting one?", "Holy hell you start by not getting a dog until you have the faintest idea of how to care for them. \n\nPlease give him to someone who knows what they\u2019re doing if you care about him in the least.", "Buy and read Culture Clash by Jean Donaldson. It\u2019s a very accessible primer on operant conditioning and dog training. It has a FABULOUS section on entertainment for dogs who need to stay at home without a person for several hours at a clip.\n\n\nBe warned. It may make you feel like a very bad dog owner, but just remember that perfect is the enemy of the good and that most people who own dogs aren\u2019t also stay at home dog owners. Don\u2019t take Jean Donaldson\u2019s levels of perfect dog ownership on the chin. Adapt what you can as best you can.\n\n\nYou should also couple this reading with an actual trainer or puppy boot camp. While Culture Clash is great on concepts, it\u2019s less concrete on day to day execution other than to hammer home the need for consistency. As a result, you need to learn how to actually train your dog on top of fulfilling all of your dog\u2019s psychological and physical needs (which the Culture Clash covers extremely well). Your dog should be able to do a number of critical commands (sit, stay, come, wait, heel) as well as recognize behavior corrections (say for barking, begging, and nipping). \n\n\nYTA. You got a dog before doing any research or educating yourself and you aren\u2019t meeting the dog\u2019s physical and psychological needs and don\u2019t even know where to being on that. That\u2019s on you. But you can fix that with studying, diligence, and some behavioral classes. So get on that.", "Ask your vet for suggestions", "If you\u2019re on a budget, in the US, and can\u2019t afford a local private dog trainer, PetSmart and Petco both offer affordable basic 4-6 week training courses for ~$200. Privates would probably be better to focus on the separation anxiety issues but some training is 100% necessary for owning a dog. \n\nThey\u2019re like toddlers that never grow up so it\u2019s on you to teach them how to navigate the world.", "I didn't say \"tie up\" dogs.  Idk where you are, but they have long leashes that you can attach to your porch or a tree or whatever.  If your dog keeps escaping, you can't let him out unless he is on a leash.", "Try Pet Smart or petco they have training there, I saw it when my mother was talking to the employees at one of them", "Is there local dogwalker who could walk him once or twice a day which would help. Can you get up earlier and wear him out before you leave so he sleep when your gone.", "Just because a lot of people in your area neglect their pets doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not neglect.", "It's not bad to leave them out if your dog is trained and not a nuisance. Yours is a nuisance and shouldn't be outside.", "Hire a damned dog walker or take him to doggy day care. Leaving him outside all day why you're gone is horrible and extremely dangerous.", "Except run in the yard apparently turns to run in the neighborhood because he constantly escapes. Crate train Bluey.", "Exactly. It\u2019s all about how you introduce it to them. My dog has a bed and blankets in hers. And she will take toys with her. Crates can be a great thing, they just can take time to build that association with a dog, but it\u2019s rewarding when you are done. (Not that you\u2019re ever truly done)", "Good to know...that breed isn't for inexperienced owners. We love them though.", "I\u2019m obviously not.", "To be clear, the trainer is not going to do the work for you. They will tell you what needs to be done and help you practice. *You* need to train your dog with consistency, every single day. You need to make sure his needs for exercise and stimulation are being met or the training will be worthless. It will take hours of your time every day especially since you are so late getting started. And in the meantime you need to leave him inside while you\u2019re at work for his and others\u2019 safety, so add the cleanup from that to your daily tasks. If you aren\u2019t willing to start doing that, like, *today*, you should rehome the dog.", "Lol true but maybe if he had someone to play witb they would at least be busy and not bored.  In theory.", "It's ok. You're making steps and the internet is a wonderful resource if you can't find a local trainer.  You're dog has had 2 years of being bad without training but dogs are wonderfully smart and they WANT you to be happy.  \n\nI don't think your neighbor hates animals.  The constant barking would drive most crazy. If your neighbor is reasonable, apologize and let them know you Are finally addressing your dog's bad habits.  \n\nI've seen a PetSmart trainer do miracles in two months (but she was really an exceptional person).\n\nYour vet might also be helpful.\n\nEducation and disciplined perseverance will fix dumb and inexperienced.", "I hope youve learned your lesson to never take something on unless you\u2019ve done extensive research. People like you who adopt pets without any forethought are the reason animals are euthanized at an alarming rate. If you rehomed your dog to a shelter it would likely be put on the kill list. I\u2019m not trying to be mean. I just hope you really learned your lesson here.", ">You can crate him during the day if needed\n\nWhy should the poor dog be locked in a crate all day, alone at home, for OP's convenience?\n\nYTA OP.

I have thought about it every word.", ">I don't think your neighbor hates animals. The constant barking would drive most crazy.\n\nI am the biggest dog nut out. Nothing sends me into a seething rage more than my neighbours yapping dog who starts the second i open my back door and will bark for hours if I don't manage my dogs outside time (i shouldn't have to but i do). We cannot leave our dogs outside for more than a few minutes at a time because he will bark the entire time and my dogs are starting to get to the point where they'll chase him on the fence which is not ok. It's like nails on a chalkboard at this point, especially since my dogs are a breed that aren't typically barkers. The owner knows and will not do anything to solve it. Like OP she's gone for hours and hours every day. There's other barking dogs around but none are as bad as this guy.", "There are no kids who might want to make some extra cash after school? Really?", "Where are you that putting a leash on a dog is illegal?", "I used the app rover and found someone who walked my dog when I was going to be late from work. She was a stay at home mom and was honestly great. My dog loved her. It wasn\u2019t super expensive and there\u2019s usually reviews for the walkers. She also used to send me photos when she was walking my dog! It was really easy to use and communicate.", "He needs to be were he feels safe and house trained. My dog barked when we left but calmed down after a while like 10 mins. He should be toliet trained in a the house and be out all day if he ia barking as they means hes upset. An elderly person could walk a small dog no problem if they are used to dogs.", "My way of thinking about difficulty raising a pet is : dogs are toddlers, cats are roommates. I think it really helps inexperienced understand the level of commitment and work a pet can have. Dogs are very dependent and if you get them from puppyhood really require training and patience in order to have good manners and avoid bad behaviours/habits. I'm glad you seem to really be understanding what went wrong and trying to fix it. \n\nIf you have a local pet store or shelter or something that's always a good place to get information on what's available for pets, you'd be surprised.", "He needs to be were he feels safe and house trained.
