This is all okay.\n\nPeople getting up in arms about you having been in public... I don't get it. Just because you're in public doesn't mean people get to invade your space and oddly hovering.

People are wrong to blame the server when they really should be blaming corporate.

It's built into the training. It's especially sucky because the training in and of itself is contradictory. They want servers to be super attentive but also expect them to read the table and tailor the service based on what they think the guest wants. So if you're super attentive like this server, you get a complaint, and if you try to give them space and they don't like it, you get a complaint.

Although I rarely go to these types of restaurants, preferring local owned places, I have occasionally. I'll give you an example. Server drops off our main course, not 2 min later ,she comes back and asks how are food is. We hadn't even taken a bite yet. She apologized, saying she noticed we hadn't , but that servers, by corporate order must check within 2 minutes of dropping off the main course, or they will have \"points\" taken away from them, too many points, they no longer have a job. This wasn't the only thing they could lose \"points\" for. Although it's normally chain restaurants, there are nitpicking managers/owners in local places who would \"set\" when and how service should be conducted .

Nobody will rush you, but you also should not tarry needlessly, if the place is very busy and there are customers waiting in line outside. Of course, in an upscale restaurant, you are free to spend as much time as you want in there, but, of course, you are entitled to do so, since your bill for the whole luxury experience will no doubt be spectacular.\n\nAlso, if the staff needs to have you seated at a table booked for a certain time, they will let you know when you are seated that you can only stay until that specific time.\n\nEven if, in some European countries (not all!), waiters do not depend on tips, the restaurant itself still depends on a high client turnover rate for the business to flourish.

And before anybody downvotes the crap out of me for this, I was a waiter for 15 years, was very good at it, and was generally tipped very well because of it. You have to cater your waiting style to what the majority of the people expect, which is for you to wait on them hand and foot. To not check on them often typically means that they will feel you\u2019re not doing your job, and will lower your wages accordingly. The waiter in your example wasn\u2019t being rude.

And yes, the wait staff is trained to inform the manager any time a table has an issue with their service.

The biggest issue I take with having the long serious talk at the restaurant is not only there servers ability to make money via tips (which is an entirely different topic in its own right) but it is also the restaurants ability to turn the table and the missed revenue. Restaurants operate on a fairly thin margin as it is, and while yes, you have paid for a meal which entitles you to use of that table.... there has to be a limit. Your analogy is flawed in my opinion and needs to be flipped around. What if you paid for a 1 hour couples massage but got in a serious conversation with your partner. Is it fair to take up the massage beds/room for 2 hours? Of course not. If the conversation is that serious and you're just taking up space after the avg/usual/normal table time..... Then perhaps you should finish the conversation in the parking lot or at one of your homes or etc. Just because between the two of you, you ordered $50 worth of food and drink which may end up as $8 or so actual profit, doesn't entitle you to that space for 3 hours.", "> or a breakup?\n\nWho the fuck invites someone to dinner at a restaurant and _breaks up with them_ during it?\n\nI'll tell you who.\n\nA fucking coward.\n\nA coward that's hoping that doing it in public will spare them having to deal with the other persons feelings _by_ doing it in public.", "Yes.", "There's no restaurant owner that would be okay with this. Turning tables is how the server AND the restaurant make money. This is true for restaurants that actually want to make a profit everywhere (the server thing is American).", "Yeah in Europe you can just sit at a table all day and they don\u2019t take reservations, obviously.\n\nCmon. Think for two seconds. Any business benefits from more paying customers and any restaurant that takes reservations needs available tables at roughly the time of the reservation. Europeans aren\u2019t some magical fairy species immune to market incentives"]}
