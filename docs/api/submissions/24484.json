Bringing the manager was weird too - was he trying to intimidate you (I can get you kicked out)?", "NTA\n\nMy guess is that manager has hard rules about the way that \"each table must be treated identically and upsell upsell upsell\" and the waiter would have gotten in trouble for leaving you alone. It's possible they sent the manager over so they could hear for themselves that their demand that EVERY table be harassed was bad for some customers. A lot of service industries have management like that, and they won't listen to their employees about it.

You did not need to go on and on about how he was being intrusive and disruptive or whatever.\n\nWith that being said, maybe you should\u2019ve gone somewhere else.

In the US I\u2019ve noticed that the opposite is true \u2014 they come over a lot. As a Brit I find that seriously annoying when visiting the US, but I recognise the cultural difference and pay the 10% tip or whatever regardless of how intrusive and overbearing I find the service. \n\nSo it\u2019s either N T A or Y T A depending on where you live. And either way, a restaurant is not the place for a quiet and personal conversation.", "NTA\n\nA good server tries to anticipate the needs of their customers. Bringing over some extra napkins if they have a small child, providing refills without having to be asked, things like that. Some tables will be particularly needy and you'll see them looking around or using things or asking lots of questions. Other tables will be leaning in to have a more private conversation. This is all okay.\n\nPeople getting up in arms about you having been in public... I don't get it. Just because you're in public doesn't mean people get to invade your space and oddly hovering. If the server was being a bit much, they simply should have said (the first time being asked) \"my apologies, please signal for me if/when you need anything, okay?\" And then done some side work or something.\n\nActually that sounds amazing because then that's one less table I'd have to babysit and I could get some other work done lol!", "I would say no one is the AH, but I don't understand why she went and got her manager after you specifically asked for privacy. For that, NTA. You are allowed privacy even in a public space. Yes, the waitress has a job to do but it sounds like she was over the top. I served for years and it was incredibly obvious when customers wanted space.", "ESH. Sure maybe the waiter shouldn\u2019t have been hovering as much, but if you\u2019re in the US that\u2019s literally his job.

I don\u2019t think he \u201csent\u201d the manager over there, but he definitely informed them that you requested he back off in order to cover his ass. What the manager decided to do after that was his own decision. \n\nNot to mention, I\u2019ve seen multiple instances of customers not wanting to be interrupted at that certain moment, but then they turn around 5 minutes later and get mad that their waiter isn\u2019t around because they need service *right now*.", "NTA, but maybe you could have worded it a little better and it sounds as if the waiter was going a little overboard with the service.
