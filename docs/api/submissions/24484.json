This is all okay.\n\nPeople getting up in arms about you having been in public... I don't get it. Just because you're in public doesn't mean people get to invade your space and oddly hovering.

Once a waiter's wife went into labor, once someone got cut badly and had to be taken to urgent care, like that was the level of exception required for them to want to flout the policy.", "Yup, immediately thought OP and mom are campers who weren't leaving.", "BINGO! \n\n  Often when customers get so involved in their Serious Conversations , no matter Where they are -they can lose track of Time & even Where they ARE ! \n\nSo many restaurants now DO enforce a Time Limit , even if it's invisible to you. \n\nIf wanting to stay longer -you have to keep ordering something . Like your renting your table space. If your waiter is asking about dessert or apertifs, thats kinda a hint. But-that along w. all Else by now going on over dining Out -have me hooked on Take Out . Even home is more pleasurable, or use your car or van ., in a nice location meant for spending & enjoying your time there . Utilize what your taxes already Paid For!", "I don\u2019t think we have it either. Something seems to be left out.", "I\u2019ve had waiters and waitresses come by every few minutes even before mains arrived. Just last week, a waitress nearly yanked my plate away with half a crab cake on it when my fork was still in my hand at one of the GAR group restaurants. OP said they were also trying to upswell different parts of the meal. \n\nI see what you\u2019re saying but sometimes, the wait staff is just extra.", ">demanding our attention by asking how the food tasted, attempting to upsell us on various items,\n\nSounds like the OP and her mom were still eating.", "Almost every post in this sub leaves out pertinent info. You make a great point.", "Agreed, I think it's obnoxious and shortsighted to hold \"personal and deep\" conversations in a restaurant.  \n\nOther patrons will be there, who might recognize you or just overhear you, the music or the ambiance might be loud, the waiter is trying to do his job, especially if you're keeping a table too long...", "Yes,\n\nAlso OP says they got some space for a brief period .\n\nI think the OP was the annoying pest not the waiter.", "I think even without the story, OP is an AH.   \n\n\n1. dinner at a local restaurant is not the place for a heartfelt conversation, especially if it can last a long time.\n2. the waiter was doing their job by checking on you, and them trying to upsell items to you was likely the hint to \"get out\"\n3. how long were you there and when did this conversation start? did you start the conversation while you were eating or did you finish, get asked if you wanted dessert, declined, and then started this \"private\" conversation while sipping on your drinks? \n4. again, public is not the place for a private conversation. It's one thing if you were reminiscing about someone who passed away, it's another if it's a serious and private.. key word is private discussion.   \n\n\nI know plenty of these conversations happen in restaurants but I can't help but feel OP's still an AH just by having it there.", "It's jarring coming back to the US and going out to eat, especially after being in Europe for a couple of weeks. It's so relaxing going out to eat there. Here? Not so much.", "Manager is an idiot in this case though. They complained about being constantly interrupted... what does manager do? INTERRUPT AGAIN. Genius move.\n\nManager should save that conversation for the bill.", "In this instance, the manager should bring them the check when it's signaled for and check in then.", "That's silly, and I'm sorry for being so blunt. I'm English, just so you know. One shouldn't have to be all \"Right, so I want to talk to my girlfriend/mother/wife about something Very Important, so I'd best take her to a small cafe or coffee shop so we can linger.\" \n\nDid I completely miss the point of your post? I mean, in a doctor's surgery, I know I have X minutes to state my case, but in a restaurant, there's no way I'd be pushing myself to be finished by X time because of table turnover. It wouldn't even occur to me. And if my waiter said, by his/her actions,  \"Sorry, it's Saturday, and we're slammed, so I'll pester you every five minutes until you leave\" I'd be most upset. \n\nI don't know, I think I'm misunderstanding you. The OP said they were pestered every few minutes, which isn't right, but you seem to be saying a restaurant isn't the right place for a serious convo?\n\nQuick Ninja edit: I upvoted your post because I'm totally prepared to accept it's a cultural thing, honestly I am.\n\nEdit again: To me, a cafe/coffee shop is more of a place where the owner and staff would be VERY present and would be making a VERY obvious point of being present and personal and \"You are in my living room having tea with me! And we're all best buddies!\" If you know what I mean.", "That 15% rule is entirely that poster's opinion lol, plenty of people will go way lower than that to tell a server that their service sucked.", "But the fine dining service is still really unobtrusive and if you asked for privacy you would get it", "Restaurants are tiny margin businesses, and most don't make enough to survive. They need every penny just to keep going.", "You've never been to an Asian restaurant lmao", "lol \"greed\" or literally wanting to be able to pay your fucking bills", "That's not OP's problem.", "Fun fact: Eating out is generally still more expensive in the US than in Europe, even without counting in tips.", "I mean sure but that's not the issue at hand", "I was just gonna say, I used to work for OG and they hassle you to go hassle your tables.", "I really think this is a habit specific to big-city restaurants with a lot of demand. If a waiter knows there's another party waiting for the table, those \"anything else for you?\" visits become a subtle nudge for you to go ahead and settle up so they can turn the table over. Sure, another round of drinks may add $4-$5 to the tip... but if they can fit another table in for service, that's at least an extra $10-$20.", "Right?! It makes no sense. \n\nOh, that table there asked to stop being interrupted during their conversation? I KNOW WHAT WILL HELP! I'll go interrupt them and apologize for the interruptions! \n\nThat's like of you complained about there being too much salt on your food, and the manager flounces over to make up for it by dumping more salt on your food.", "You are absolutely correct it\u2019s not going to improve the situation and it shouldn\u2019t be done. \n\nUnfortunately the manager is obligated to go check. It\u2019s really OPs fault. \n\n1: OP could have asked for privacy at the start,  \u201ccan we get a table for a private conversation with no interruptions \u201c\n\n2: OP could have let this be known after the first interruption. \u201cWe appreciate your service, we won\u2019t be needing anything else as we\u2019d like to have a private conversation, we\u2019ll be sure to call you over if we need anything else.\u201d\n\nOP failed to plan and placed himself in a frustrating situation. All his fault.", "The greed of the owners in this case, not that of the waiters.", "I served tables for ten years and I can assure you that is exactly what most customers want. I have also had experiences where a table wanted a private conversation and I would respect that. The server was probably new and there was no asshole in this instance, though I for sure wouldnt want to ever wait on op as she seems incapable of sympathizing with the classes beneath her as she clearly doesnt understand what a servers job is.", "If you don't trust your employees, fire them. There's no point in keeping them but be second guessing every single thing they tell you.", "Plenty of restaurant managers are intelligent, insightful people.  The rest of them are not.", "I agree. OP probably was at least short if not outright angry with the waiter, I know that is an assumption, but due to the way they  built the story to full blown irritation/annoyance/anger, it is difficult to imagine it was said politely, which would lead to some upset on the waiter's part, for sure. \n\nNo to mention, if this was getting lengthy as some others suggested, that table is losing money for the restaurant and the server. It's really inconsiderate", "Three hours for dinner is not at all unusual in Europe. Starter, main, dessert, coffee, three hours is fine.", "It depends on a lot of factors\u2026.. I run a restaurant I would have left it alone. The only reason I would have gone over is if they were mean to the server\u2026.. or the restaurant was slammed and tables were expected to turn over faster. If you have a giant waitlist and customers are \u201ccamping\u201d you gently nudge them to move it along. You aren\u2019t paying for the table for the entire evening\u2026.. \n\nBut those are the only reasons id go over.

Customers are NTA for voicing frustrations with that system.", "1000000% this.", "Exactly. I've had a similar situation as an EMT. A patient was being taken to the cath lab BLS which was ridiculous because they need cardiac monitoring which we can't do. I ask the nurse and they don't see why the patient wouldn't need cardiac monitoring. The doctor confronts me about it and I ask why they're being taken to the cath lab BLS and he said it's likely kidney related. After a few more questions I say if he signs off on it then okay, and it's on him to which he agrees. A few minutes later he storms over and says if we're not comfortable taking the patient then he doesn't want us taking the patient in obvious backpedaling because he knows he fucked up. My partner starts objecting but I motion for her to back down. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI tell my manager what happened in case they complain and they said they'd watch out for it in case they did, there's no need for them to reach out about something that isn't an issue yet.   \n\n\nIt turns out they originally ordered it ALS but didn't like the response time so they downgraded it to BLS \ud83d\ude44"]}
