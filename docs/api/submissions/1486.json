You're young and selfish.", "The main reason I don't want to go to the wedding is because I rarely even speak to that cousin (we have nothing in common and rarely even see each other), hardly know the girl he's marrying, and I'm a major Introvert with anxiety around crowds, which my family knows. Pictures is just another reason because I don't like having pictures of me around the house or posted online. Just the thought someone other than me has a photo of me gets my anxiety going. I feel I have a right to privacy, and that pictures should be included in that right to privacy.\n\nAnother part of it is that I'm always forced to go to places that I'm not even told about until last minute, which just makes me not want to go. I just wouldn't have fun and would be upset the whole time.", "With my family I basically never have a choice. If they want me to go somewhere they just force me to go no matter what I say. And what's stupid too is that my mom said she needs someone to watch the dogs, but refuses to let that person be me. The dogs like laying down with me, too, so if anything it'd be a good idea if I watched them instead of whoever she's thinking of (which by the way she still wants someone within the family to watch the dogs)", "I don't make any money, and even if I did I legally can't drive due to my Epilepsy, so I can't move out.\n\nI've asked My mom ever since I was 16 to help me find a job and drive me there when I get one so I don't have to ask her for money, and despite saying she will everytime, she magical forgets the conversation ever happens the next morning.\n\nRight now all I have is a YouTube channel with 65 subscribers, and am trying to upload there in hopes I can turn that into a job.", "Please elaborate. How am I being selfish? If I don't know, I can't improve. And what does being young have to do with it?"]}
