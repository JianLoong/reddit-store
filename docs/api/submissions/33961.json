Your sister has chosen martyrdom and you are the lucky recipient of the \u201cevil sister\u201d badge.", "I have to say in my personal experience having a miscarriage is like a death. Also hormones are out of wack and lastly shock. Giving a short text for what she went through is harsh. I get you're not close but what she went through is devastating and putting aside your differences and calling her and offering support would probably mean a lot to her. People can die during these experiences and it's life changing.", "NTA. People reap what they sow. I want to add that I have had a miscarriage, so I feel \u2018allowed\u2019 to weigh in on what is \u201cfair\u201d to be expected of people in the aftermath. \n\nI am like you and cannot tolerate people expecting a relationship they put no effort into. I was expecting much worse from your tagline but you sent a very empathetic text back. \n\nThe only people who \u201cdid more\u201d for me than just speak empathetically and let me talk about the loss or not talk about the loss were my husband and my best friend. My best friend brought me a latte and some soups for my freezer and we sat and talked for a few hours. My husband did all that a husband can and should do to support their partner after a loss. \n\nMy sister and I don\u2019t have a relationship so I didn\u2019t tell her about the loss. My SIL knows, has had losses of her own, and also didn\u2019t do anything other than talk when I wanted to about it. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what she expected but if there was something additional to the text then she absolutely should have said so before it turned to resentment.\n\nMy personal opinion is that your sister desperately needed the support and didn\u2019t get it. It should have come from her own partner or her closer family and friends but she didn\u2019t get it. She resents those people for it and needs someone to be mad at. She\u2019s channeling her disappointment, anger, feelings of being not worth it, etc. to you because the relationship with you is low stakes and can be tanked because you aren\u2019t close anyway.", "NTA. As you said, she has a history of being entitled and one sided in the relationship.

I told her straight up that if she wanted a different response from me, then she should\u2019ve been having a different relationship with me over the past 15 years. She doubled down and doesn\u2019t see my point.", "I wouldn\u2019t say I acted like I didn\u2019t care - I said I was sorry for the loss and I was actually sorry because it does suck, nobody\u2019s denying that, but I just didn\u2019t really feel natural going further than that or asking more questions/etc. You\u2019re correct, we don\u2019t communicate well, and tbh I was afraid to ask questions or try to go more into detail because the lashing out behavior here is common for her. She also was involuntarily committed just prior to this pregnancy, so I didn\u2019t know where she stood and didn\u2019t want to find out I pushed her over the edge or something. I felt it was touchy and because we\u2019re not close, just left it at what I did.\n\nRe: the post-wedding stuff, I didn\u2019t go into super details because of the post limit. More so was just trying to put forth the idea that she wants me at her discretion when it\u2019s convenient to her, but not the other way around. More specifically - she had 4 bridesmaids, the other 3 didn\u2019t even show up to her bridal shower or to the wedding on time because honestly, her relationship with friends / other family is similar to ours. It\u2019s at her convenience and she has a hard time keeping people around her being like that. I was there every step of the way, planned and payed for her bridal shower and aspects of her actual wedding, etc. and she never even quickly said hey thanks the day of. She also skipped over me when writing thank you cards too, which I wouldn\u2019t have cared if she would\u2019ve just said thank you in passing at one point. My mom found out about this and addressed her to which she doubled down there and said I didn\u2019t need thanked for anything.", "Correct! We are formally husband/wife now. The lashing out and conversations I referred to started in May and then things were shut down because she was literally texting us saying she hoped our future child died within its first year of life. Then things went no contact from May-Nov, just prior to my wedding, and she started reaching out/lashing out again because she knew my wedding was coming up (was texting my fianc\u00e9 the week before the wedding telling him he should second guess marrying me because of this). So, we haven\u2019t had conversations with her since prior to getting married, as we had to block her unfortunately\u2014 which is why I phrased it like that, but it sounds confusing.", "I definitely don\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong here \u2014 I think this is pretty on par, I just don\u2019t think I can understand her confusion on the different interpretations of the relationship. She has done a lot to intentionally harm me in life & then plays this card of \u2018I didn\u2019t know I did anything wrong.\u2019 Ex- asked to come visit me at my house with my roommates for my bday (prior to my current relationship) and left the bar that night with who she knew was my disgruntled ex & slept with him. It\u2019s been years and she admits it happened, but won\u2019t acknowledge that it was prob not cool to do to me. She smirks and changes the subject when it\u2019s brought up. That\u2019s one somewhat comical example of a million things that have lead the relationship to where it is.", "you seriously believe she had a miscarriage just to mess things up for you? If that's true, YTA.\n\nto most people who've never experienced a pregnancy loss, they really don't understand the emotional toll it can take. It can be so hurtful to hear \"it's just a miscarriage, you'll have other kids\" or something along those lines. Maybe your sister for the first time really felt the need for family support. I would not instantly ascribe malicious reasons for her actions. No one but the mother knows what it's like, although if the father's in tune with her he gets and inkling of the pain. You go into the hospital pregnant and you leave not pregnant. It's as if your baby never existed. And frequently it didn't to anyone but you. It's possible that the grief and the hormonal fluctuations are making it impossible to articulate what she needs from you. It's possible she's wanted to be closer for years but didn't have the emotional intelligence or maturity to know it, let alone articulate it.\n\nOr she could be just what you think. None of us know.\n\nI was never close with my brothers until one of them died and one of the other and I went to Europe to claim his body. It was then that I finally got to know the kid I grew up disliking if not despising. We are close now and I'm so glad. We helped each other through his cheating wife, the death of our parents, and are there for each other now. We're not twins close, but it's nice to have family.\n\nFood for thought. She's suffered something you can only imagine. is it possible to sit down and have a heart to heart and see if you can start to mend fences?", "You can\u2019t win. Let her go and know you tried.", "Cool. Still ESH.", ">asked to come visit me at my house with my roommates for my bday (prior to my current relationship) and left the bar that night with who she knew was my disgruntled ex & slept with him  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>she was literally texting us saying she hoped our future child died within its first year of life\n\nOkay, the other things you've mentioned were bad enough -- but these indicate that she has serious narcissistic/sociopathic tendencies.\n\nRational discussions will have zero effect with someone like this. She will never change. Just block her on your (and your husband's) phone / email / social media, go No Contact with her and move on. Consider it a blessing that she's decided to avoid you.", "haha that makes sense, also i would\u2019ve assumed that it\u2019s either that or maybe you\u2019re just new to married life so still getting used to calling him your husband in conversation. \nbut anyway, again, you are NTA, you did what anybody would do given the kind of relationship you have with her, especially since it looks like if she wanted more and expressed what she wanted from you, you\u2019d have done that to support her. \ncongratulations on your wedding, i wish you the best", "A lot of assumptions here..\n\nWhere did I articulate that I thought she had a miscarriage to mess things up for me? I responded to another comment re: her lashing out & potential reasoning behind it by saying that I didn\u2019t find a lot of this problematic behavior in the aftermath to be coincidental. That\u2019s what this post is about - problematic behavior in the aftermath, now almost a year later. I never questioned the trauma she experienced or the loss the experienced, I questioned the fact that a year later somebody is still lashing out at myself and my partner over this and refusing to move forward. This also isn\u2019t something I can \u2018only imagine,\u2019 - which is another incorrect assumption.\n\nThe initial conversation re: this was almost a year ago and we went on with life, as normal, for several months before she disclosed to me that she was upset about this - 6 months prior to my wedding. When she disclosed she was upset about this it was a reaction to another conversation where I said wouldn\u2019t do what she wanted me to \u2014 She pursued genetic testing and wanted me/my now husband to pay out of pocket to do it as well, when we weren\u2019t trying to conceive (and still aren\u2019t). I told her we would do so when timing was appropriate and it was medically recommended for us, which set her off because she doesn\u2019t like to be told no. At that point, she brought up her feelings on my response to the miscarriage, which included saying she \u2018did not give a fuck about our timing,\u2019 she \u2018hoped our future baby would die within its first year of life,\u2019 and unsuccessfully tried to turn me/my parents against each other in the process. At this point, again only 6 months out from my wedding, she began telling our mom how she was refusing to be around me, etc. We did not communicate from May-Nov and she began reaching back out in Nov because of being put up to it by our grandmother / mom due to my upcoming wedding. She wasn\u2019t ready for it and continued to lash out at me and when I stopped engaging with the behavior, she sought out my now husband. She was texting him telling him not to marry me the week before our wedding & criticizing his parents/family at the same time. None of it really tied into the original point, it\u2019s just unhealthy, maladaptive coping mechanisms and things that need addressed professionally at this point.", "That\u2019s pretty much where we\u2019re at and how we feel about her - my husband has known us since childhood, but has been in my life in this respect (as my partner) for 3.5ish years now. I\u2019ve felt this way about her for a long time and it took him maybe 3-4 months to pick up on it without me pointing anything out to him.\n\nLike others have said 1) miscarriage is a death and it is tragic and it is life changing and 2) it shocks you/hormones are raging, etc. Hence why I originally posted without a lot of these other details - because I just wanted to see, at a surface level, where people stood on this. Because I really have tried to understand and wrap my head around it, but because of her past behavior and tendencies, we just can\u2019t wrap our heads around it. Tbh I think a lot of this was her trying to tarnish my wedding season/memories for me (it didn\u2019t) because she has these narc tendencies. I also think she rushed to get pregnant when she did (not good timing, as she was fresh out of the mental hospital) because I had just gotten engaged and she wanted to pop a baby out before I got married - which mind you, actually wouldn\u2019t have bothered me. But would something like this irk her soul? Yes, everything bothers her. \n\nSomething else that I think irked her - I decided on a small, intimate wedding. No bridal party, etc. Just courthouse and dinner party with immediate family. So she didn\u2019t get the opportunity to fuck me over as a MOH either.", "Maybe it\u2019s time to have no relationship at all ? NTA", "Based solely on the question within the title, I'm going to have to go with YTA. You responded to some traumatic and sad news without personalisation, almost like a copy and paste job off Google, and didn't check in on her a few days later. Nobody is saying, given your relationship (or lack of) that you should drop everything and spend months by her side hugging her, but given that you had a neutral relationship rather than a negative one, you could've treated her with more empathy and compassion. Send some flowers... get her a gift card for food delivery perhaps... message her every few days to see how she is doing... simple yet thoughtful gestures which could go a long way. When an initial message is received from a family member with devastating news for them, a bit more personalisation would also be a better response.\n\nOutside this issue, you and your sister need to learn how to properly communicate. It appears you both have varying perceptions of how close you both are, regardless of how your behaviours are interpreted. It appears your sister believes you are closer than you think, and you just feel neutral and that your sister generally communicates with you when life events of hers (happy like a wedding, sad like a miscarriage) take place. I think you both would benefit from a proper conversation, with or without the presence of a therapist, to establish what you both would like from the relationship, how to compromise and how you can move on going forward. It isn't sustainable, nor fair, on the wider family to duplicate and make separate events to keep you both apart. If you both do wish to have a better relationship, then maybe the first step in apologising for the miscarriage response could be to donate to a miscarriage charity in memory of the baby.", "<< This is just how things go between us.>>\n\ninstall a spine and stop wet noodling her nasty behavior.", "So let me get this straight, you do a whole intro about not having much of a relationship, but are kerfluffed, that now there's actually no relationship you can't turn to her?\n\nA simple: hey how are you doing, some flowers or even, dropping off some food since that news, which is what i even do to people i only barely know when they've gone through something traumatic is something you didn't even do.\n\nThere's lack of empathy and then there's apathy...\n\nGonna go YTA, you were just using basic one liners to a traumatic event 'i think of you but not really'", "NTA. She has main character syndrome and expects that you revolve around her like the sun. However in the real world if you want a relationship with someone you need to put the effort in.

It's not ok to repeatedly lash out at you/cause family drama.\n\nIf she chooses this hill to die on it's absolutely not your fault.

She didn't say she had a miscarriage to cause the trouble.\n\nShe said she caused drama in the lead up to the wedding.

She feels this was less about the miscarriage and her response to it and more about finding a way to cause an argument to avoid the wedding.", "NTA\n\nI think your text to your sister about the miscarriage was fine. I say this having had two miscarriages, including one that happened very late.\n\nFrom your comments, your sister sounds like she has some sort of personality disorder, and the level of rage she has directed at you is unreasonable and a bit unhinged.\n\nIt seems like you have no choice other then cutting her off.

Sounds like you should have gone no contact a long time ago.", "OP isn't trying to turn to the sister for anything. She just wants the sister to not be openly hostile and badmouth her for not doing the *something* sister expected but can never actually say what it is.", "Valid question! I was honestly just curious about an outsider perspective where nobody knows us. I feel like she can be really manipulative & she\u2019s been spending the past 6+ months trying to make me think I\u2019m the worst person to walk this earth and deserve no love. She also will try to get into my head and convince me that everybody is talking about me behind my back, has issues with me, etc. like my parents, extended family, etc. That gets to me sometimes & I felt like I needed the outsider perspective. This all also came to a head recently because I got married right before the holidays - so my wedding & the holidays (family events) happened on the heels of this issue with her. \n\nWe have issues like this pretty frequently, but over things that are less important. She will completely lash out at me and just rip me apart if I so much as have a different opinion than her. She will text me for hours on end just going off about everything she hates about me to the point that I have to block her number \u2014 which is what I had to do when the lashing out re: this started in May. Normally, when something like this happens, I just block her number and move on with life for a few months until she settles down. But obviously, with my wedding coming up, everybody was kind of in my ear about having to rectify the situation because I needed to make sure that my \u2018sister was at my wedding.\u2019 On the other end, people were also in her ear too about my wedding coming up. After going no contact from May-Nov, she made last ditch efforts to try to make contact with me and couldn\u2019t help herself from lashing out at me again. I didn\u2019t play into any of it and that\u2019s when she started making comments about my now husband/relationship/etc. because I wasn\u2019t engaging with her BS- and I 3000% defended him/us & shut her down. She then flipped the script & reached out to him, a week before the wedding at that, to talk shit on me and try to get him to call off the wedding. Hence why she was not at our wedding Lol - it\u2019s sad because I do really feel bad that she feels this lost, desperate, etc. right now about this, but she\u2019s absolutely nuts and her behaviors almost a year later aren\u2019t reflective of the original issue anymore, IMO. She\u2019s using it as an excuse to be crazy and try to get away with it. His sibling has not always been perfect to me either (nothing to this level though), and we both stand up for the other. \n\nHowever, we just never really cared to be around her more than necessary because she\u2019s annoying to be around/negative. We had a really intimate wedding with less than 20 people, and when we were planning our wedding, we made jokes about the fact that we wish we didn\u2019t have to invite her because she just would kill the vibe in one way or another. However, we knew that it wouldn\u2019t go over well to not include my sibling. So, this ended up being a blessing in disguise because she essentially pushed herself out & we had a valid reason to not include her. As a result, our wedding was honestly perfect & exactly what we wanted.", "Info: was he your ex when she slept with him or were y'all still together? Why did you agree to be her MOH if she is your Ex's affair partner?\n\nI was with the above comment on no judgement originally but after this reply I'm wildly confused and am thinking we are missing information.", "There\u2019s a ton of missing info re: our poor relationship and how it got to where I keep her at arms length because of post limit. From my POV, she did things in life that can\u2019t really be explained other than just being terrible to me & pushed me further and further away until I got to the point where I was prior to this happening (keeping her at a distance and being civil a few times a year).\n\nThe ex thing occurred when I was still in college & she was with her now husband (not married yet, but were living together). Me and him were not together at the time, but he was still in my larger friend group and somehow ended up out with us on my birthday (I didn\u2019t invite him, but you know how that goes when everybody\u2019s in your 20\u2019s and going out etc). She left with him knowing exactly who he was to me & my roommates even followed her back to his house begging her not to do this because 1) he was my ex and 2) she would be cheating on her partner by doing this, however, she slammed a door in their faces and did it anyways. I was young and still reliant on my parents in some ways, and they pushed me to get over that. They pushed me to get over a lot with her over the years - my mom especially. She always is like okay it doesn\u2019t matter though, she\u2019s your sister. That\u2019s how my mom\u2019s relationship with her siblings is, it\u2019s completely boundary-less, but everything is okay and nothing is off the table because blood is thicker than water to them. \n\nAs far as agreeing to be MOH years later, same thing. If I didn\u2019t agree to it, I never would\u2019ve heard the end of it from my mom. I also don\u2019t want to have a poor relationship with my sibling if I don\u2019t have to, so I\u2019ve been very forgiving and tried to move past things with her multiple times in the past.\n\nEdit** Pretty much, she did poor things to me numerous times in the past, and I was forced by my mom to move past things in the name of sisterhood. Now, in this current situation, the tables have turned, and my sister is the one that feels she\u2019s been wronged and she\u2019s the one that\u2019s angry. In the current situation, my mom is very hands off and says that whatever we do as adults has nothing to do with her - no pushing anybody to move past things. Do what you want with this info!", "I hope you\u2019ve read your parents into this situation, so they know the irrationality they are dealing with on your sister\u2019s side.", "I have, however, my mom is kind of just throwing her hands in the air at this rate. She says we\u2019re adults and there\u2019s nothing she can do. I agree, she can\u2019t control us. However, you can condemn concerning behavior. You can also stop trying to force a relationship that is shot and no longer wanted."]}
