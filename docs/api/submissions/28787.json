I was in the mood for veal parm but when we sat down I was a bit bummed to see it wasn't on the menu. However, they had both chicken parm, and several veal dishes, including veal milanese on the menu. When the waiter came to take our order I asked if it was possible for the chef to do veal parm. He told me he had to ask the chef, took our drink orders and came back and said yes the chef can do veal parm. I figured it was an easy swap because they have veal cutlets to make veal milanese, and they have chicken parm on the menu so they could just swap out the chicken cutlet for a veal one.\n\nMy sister is a waitress herself and she insisted that ITA because I essentially asked for a different dish to be created. I argued while I agree it is a \"different dish\", it's not like I asked them to create something completely different from scratch, it's a one ingredient swap with something they already had on the menu. I said the cutlets are probably already breaded and fried anyway so what's the difference with swapping a chicken cutlet out with a veal one?\nAnd even if they aren't breaded and fried ahead of time, I would have either ordered chicken parm which would cause them to fry a chicken cutlet, or veal milanese so they would fry a veal cutlet anyway.\n\nShe said the fact that the waiter had to ask the chef if they could meant it was out of ordinary, and I said he was just checking to ask the chef's permission, and they said yes. Had he said no I would have just ordered something else. They charged us accordingly and we paid (my parents treated us) and left a generous tip like we always do.

Sis needs to cool it. There\u2019s no harm in asking! As you said, if they couldn\u2019t do it, you\u2019d have gotten something else. Just because you ask something to be made to your preference doesn\u2019t mean a new dish is being created \ud83d\ude44. It\u2019s an ingredient for ingredient swap, no biggie.\n\nINFO: as a side note, does your sister when she is waitressing have an internal bias and discriminate against those with allergies etc.? Her mindset is \u201cmenu swaps are a no no\u201d and it\u2019s inferred based on how it reads that there are no exceptions in her eyes because it is \u201ccreating a dish\u201d. Does that mean she makes a stink when people who can\u2019t have certain ingredients, but want the dish request it without those ingredients?? That\u2019s discrimination.\n\nSerious question because she was making such a fuss about menu swaps. I know you may not have food allergies, but it\u2019s still a valid scenario. And an actual problem.", "If it was a pain in the ass at all then the chef would have said no. The fact that the waiter had to ask the chef first does not inherently make OP an asshole, that part doesn\u2019t even make sense. \n\nAlso, not to be rude, but I don\u2019t see what the opinion of a waitress (the sister) has to do with anything here. The only person who would be inconvenienced by OPs request was the kitchen.

Perfectly reasonable request, it's not like you demanded anything.", "NTA. You asked, the chef agreed. You didn't demand it or ask for something ridiculous. It is literally a single ingredient swap.

Waiter could have said no. I personally would only order something off the menu if it is not a busy night though. Working in a kitchen is so stressfull so an extra dish adds some stress. So I do understand where your sister comes from. But they could have said no.", "  I lived in Italy for a short while. There was a very nice Italian restaurant locally that did not have what I wanted, much like you. I asked for a very specific Italian dish that is known in Italy and the waiter went out and checked just as yours did. I didn't even ask for the traditional version but mixed it up a bit with an alteration of the way I liked it done.  He came back and said sure. Some short time later the chef came out and asked me about how I knew to order this dish and how delighted he was to make it for me. I told him about swimming out to collect muscles at Rimini and how much I loved this dish.  Later when I would go I would ask the waiter if Chef Roberto was there and if he was (he always was) I would tell the waiter to ask him to make my dish. Invariably he would come out for a moment to say hello and chat. A free glass of wine or a desert was not uncommon.  It didn't hurt that I tipped 50% or more.  I am sure there are some chefs that bridle at any change but I can tell you that at least some of them are very pleased to have somebody ask for something a bit different and you know they will be making it just a little special simply because it IS a little special.  I have never hesitated to ask for something off the menu, particularly in fine dining where I know it's not just an assembly line.", "NTA. They had the ingredients. It not like you were asking for something they did not have or know how to make. The chef had the right to say no.", "NTA for sure. You asked if they can do the thing, they agreed. I see no point to agrue about\n\nI go to one indian restaurant, and i have my own special meal.

It's not like you went to a Vegan place and made the ask.  If you ask and they say no, you have the answer, but if you don't ask you'll never know.  Your sister must not work at an accommodating restaurant if that's her position or she has no conception that veal parm = chicken parm/ chicken * veal and it is not a different dish to be created.", "NTA, your sister\u2019s wired way too tight", "NTA this is done at any restaurant - you can ask if something is available to be made.", "I suppose I get where she's coming from, but like a friend always says. \"Don't ask, don't get\" There was no harm in asking, if they didn't want to do it, they would have said no. As it is, they said yes. NTA", "NTA. It wasn't that bad of a request and the chef didn't think so either.", "If it\u2019s not crazy busy in the kitchen cooks enjoy something different. Probably had fun making it.", "NTA - While I have seen \"No substitutions please\" printed on a few menus, it's either a super fancy place with a prix fixe menu or else it's a fast food place. Anyone that is called \"chef\" needs to be able to do basic substitutions like this. It's not like you asked for a Baked Alaska.", "NTA. I\u2019m a waitress and it\u2019s really common to do this. Like you said, you didn\u2019t ask for a whole new dish from scratch", "NTA for the request.  Every cook I\u2019ve worked with would refuse a request that was actually inconvenient. Same dish, different protein, which is already available?  No problem.", "NTA\n\nIn a good restaurant they actually COOK the food and don't just heat it up.\n\nThey might have sauces and other stuff prepared in advance obviously but the actual dish is cooked and assembled when ordered.\n\nObviously the waitress had to confirm that the Veal Parm could be accommodated but there is absolutely no reason why any \"real\" restaurant wouldn't accommodate it. The prep and ingredients are identical to Chicken Parm except for the obvious substitution of veal for chicken.", "NTA, if it was an issue they'd just say no.", "This sounds like a question for people on a restaurant sub, because while it seems fine to me, I'd never do it, and would take the word of people in the industry on whether it is bad or not.\n\nBut I can't be the only one thinking you were wondering if you were an asshole for eating veal.", "NTA if the chef said it was ok then it was. If they couldn\u2019t do it then they would have said. You didn\u2019t demand or insist just asked if it was possible. Possibly the place your sister works has a very firm policy to not make menu changes but obviously this restaurant was happy to do it.", "Out of the 6 people saying you are half of them gave no reason and half said it was because you were eating veal which I find hilarious. NTA btw.", "NTA I think you were right that it was an easy adjustment for the chef and if they didn't feel comfortable making it they would have said no. The yes says they were confident they could and do it well enough to make you happy.", "NTA\n\nIt does no harm to ask politely.\n\nIf it is an absurd question, the server will just say no, or will waste a minute of their time asking the kitchen and getting a no from them.\n\nMaybe it is a simple request, or one the chef is happy to oblige, and you get the meal you want.\n\nAs long as you are polite and accepting of the answer you are given, I see no issue.", "NTA. It\u2019s as simple as swapping out for a different cut of meat.", "NTA, but that doesn't mean that the staff was happy to do it.  Just that they did.", "NTA, they had all the component parts and the relevant technique on the menu, so you weren't waltzing in there and asking for a pulled pork sandwich lol.", "NTA for what you asked, that didn't seem like a major inconvenience for the kitchen by all means.\n\nbut eating veal.. i dunno. i would find that questionable", "NTA: that's an easy dish the way they described the menu. I bet they do a veal Parm as a special from time to time since nothing extra needs to be prepped.\n\nEasy ask and back when I worked in the kitchen I wouldn't have thought twice about it.", "NTA, and you are right, the chef could have said no and it seem like you would have been fine with ordering something else. I wouldn't say your sister is an AH but I do agree that she was stuck in her waitress mindset. I can't say that I understand because I'm not a waiter/waitress myself but I believe not all restaurants are the same so it certainly does not hurt to ask for any changes and the worse thing that could have happen is a simple no.", "NTA I used to serve too and sure it can be a pain in the ass but it\u2019s really not all that hard especially if chef is down for it", "NTA your sister is a waitress not a chef, she needs to stay in her lane. I assure you if the chef didn't want to make it, they wouldn't. A swap like this is no big deal.", "NTA", "NTA at all! Chefs love that! If they could not, the chef would not permit them to take the order. And more places need Yummy Veal Parm!", "NTA. \nI regularly visit a small Italian place and order the same dish every time which os a modified version of their fettuccine bolognese by substituting angel hair pasta and adding grilled shrimp. The first time I asked for this the server even commented how appealing that sounded. She told me on another trip she had it for herself and loved it. \nIts not like you asked for Chinese fried rice at the Italian place. Your sister sounds like she is a bit of a try hard because of her job.", "NTA. There's no harm in politely asking.  Unless your waitress sister is also the chef at the restsurant she works at, her opinion on this is moot.  It's not the wait person's call to make.", "NTA.  I don't see why your sister had an issue here.  Your request was actually very simple, and the chef said they could accommodate you.

Veal comes from young calves who are confined and killed at just a few months old. These sensitive, intelligent animals experience extreme cruelty and deprivation during their short lives. Choosing this dish directly financially supports these abusive practices. \n\nWhile the kitchen workflow or menu substitutions may be minor concerns, the animal welfare issues are severe and should be the top priority.

But many chefs are able to accommodate.\n\nNTA", "It\u2019s not a big deal.  NTA\n\nNo clue as to why sister is making a mountain out of ant hill\u2026?", "For real, easy swap and an extra \\~$9 for the house they wouldn't have otherwise got. This was totally in their favor to do.", "I once ordered a chicken caesar salad with chicken strips on top versus the grilled chicken they normally put on there. I like the added crunch, not a big fan of grilled chicken. Lady at the next table tried giving me crap about substituting and I had to tell her \"I work here, I already knew it's perfectly fine, it's just one type of chicken versus another.\"", "I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say she\u2019s not a very good waitress. One of the smaller restaurants I worked at had a very temperamental chef so some days asking for swaps isn\u2019t a problem and he was nice but others he would make the rest of your evening hell for asking. I would cringe when a customer asked because I never knew which chef I would get that night.", "nta, a menu with every combination is just too big and unmanagable. i agree this is very much in the boundaries of normal. like asking for cream instead of ice cream on a dessert when you see they have the other one but it doesn't go with it on the menu. \n\ncooking times etc will be basically the same with the switch here as well.", "My guess is that in this particular case, veal parm isn't on the menu because they don't sell a lot of it, not because the staff doesn't want to make it. They clearly can, and did. Sis needs to shut her yap. OP, NTA. There's never any harm in asking---it's how you respond to a denied request that matters. I hope you enjoyed your veal parm!", "Plus, if the chef was really annoyed, he could have said no. The fact that he said yes makes me think it\u2019s no big deal. I\u2019m also a former server and this wouldn\u2019t have bothered me at all. There are so many other worse things people do. So so many. NTA", "I worked back of the house, and lots of chefs definitely get angry if a server doesn't ask about things like this first. Some substitutions take a lot more work or just aren't possible because of how the different ingredients are prepped, in which case the kitchen staff will obviously refuse the request. This definitely isn't one of those situations since I can guarantee you they already had both the veal and the chicken breasts breaded ahead of time so it's just a simple swap. The fact that the chef had no issue with it means OP definitely isn't an asshole.", "As a previous cook, if it was a simple swap chicken for veal, it was never a big deal and we rarely even raised our eyebrows at it.", "Possibly the sister works somewhere where they do not want to accommodate this type of thing, whether because they find it difficult with their menu or their chef or whatever.", "It's very silly to say that op's sister may discriminate against allergies just because she feels that ordering off menu is poor manners, lmao. Nobody considers a simple allergy request to be an off menu or customization order, unless you're ordering sesame noodles with no sesame or something like that. Servers and chefs know the difference.", "NTA...i do this all the time. You want my business...meaning money...then attempt to accommodate me. If you cant because you dont have the item...i get it...but it should be expected that if you are paying you can make a request. For example they have a mussels dish...i want clams prepared same way...of course i expect to pay more but certainly within my right as a diner. No different than requesting a dish to be made spicy. Tell sister to cool it.", "21F ?  you bet she's wound tight", "> would take the word of people in the industry on whether it is bad or not\n\nWell I mean, we have already heard the word of at least one person in the industry: the chef in question. That person was fine with it.", "Yeah, anyone who eats veal is an arsehole.", "former server here. it\u2019s not a big deal to get these reasonable requests every once in while. but you have to drop everything you\u2019re doing, walk to the kitchen, wait for permission to speak to chef, let them think about whether it\u2019s feasible, go back to the table to relay the news, possibly ask a manager how to upcharge or ring in an off-menu item, type in a bunch of extra instructions on the order, walk back to the kitchen again to make sure no one is confused, & when the order comes up, if other people are running your food, you may have to relay the message again. are some restaurants more organized with this message relaying? sure. but don\u2019t count on it.  \nwhen it\u2019s busy & within a half hour 3 of your tables have made off-menu requests, this time adds up so fast.", "Yeah I thought this was going to be a story about an upset vegan/vegetarian from the headline \ud83d\ude02", "The sister isn't taking into account that the server might be relatively new and hasn't been asked this yet. If OP went to brunch, didn't see an omelette on the menu, but saw eggs and all of the ingredients that they wanted in their omelette on the menu, then they would have been creating their menu item and absolutely WOULD be TA. Asking about protein swaps is not a big deal, because, as you pointed out, they can just say no.", ">but I believe not all restaurants are the same\n\nwhat, how dare you have a nuanced take on this issue!", "Would he not be TA if he had chicken?", "This is the real correct answer.", "Downvoted for being right", "Do you eat eggs?", "Then the chef would say no. There's really only one person whose opinion on this matters and we already know that person was on board, so I don't see the problem.", "The difference there being that the chef said NO\n\nIn this story, the chef said YES \n\nThe spaghetti guy also made a huge scene, OP said they would not have made a scene", ">spaghetti  Bolognese\n\nLook.... do you have spaghetti?
