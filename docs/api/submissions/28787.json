I was in the mood for veal parm but when we sat down I was a bit bummed to see it wasn't on the menu. However, they had both chicken parm, and several veal dishes, including veal milanese on the menu. When the waiter came to take our order I asked if it was possible for the chef to do veal parm. He told me he had to ask the chef, took our drink orders and came back and said yes the chef can do veal parm. I figured it was an easy swap because they have veal cutlets to make veal milanese, and they have chicken parm on the menu so they could just swap out the chicken cutlet for a veal one.\n\nMy sister is a waitress herself and she insisted that ITA because I essentially asked for a different dish to be created. I argued while I agree it is a \"different dish\", it's not like I asked them to create something completely different from scratch, it's a one ingredient swap with something they already had on the menu. I said the cutlets are probably already breaded and fried anyway so what's the difference with swapping a chicken cutlet out with a veal one?\nAnd even if they aren't breaded and fried ahead of time, I would have either ordered chicken parm which would cause them to fry a chicken cutlet, or veal milanese so they would fry a veal cutlet anyway.\n\nShe said the fact that the waiter had to ask the chef if they could meant it was out of ordinary, and I said he was just checking to ask the chef's permission, and they said yes. Had he said no I would have just ordered something else. They charged us accordingly and we paid (my parents treated us) and left a generous tip like we always do.

Sis needs to cool it. There\u2019s no harm in asking! As you said, if they couldn\u2019t do it, you\u2019d have gotten something else. Just because you ask something to be made to your preference doesn\u2019t mean a new dish is being created \ud83d\ude44. It\u2019s an ingredient for ingredient swap, no biggie.\n\nINFO: as a side note, does your sister when she is waitressing have an internal bias and discriminate against those with allergies etc.? Her mindset is \u201cmenu swaps are a no no\u201d and it\u2019s implied based on how it reads that there are no exceptions in her eyes because it is \u201ccreating a dish\u201d. Does that mean she makes a stink when people who can\u2019t have certain ingredients, but want the dish request it without those ingredients?? That\u2019s discrimination.\n\nSerious question because she was making such a fuss about menu swaps. I know you may not have food allergies, but it\u2019s still a valid scenario. And an actual problem.", "If it was a pain in the ass at all then the chef would have said no. The fact that the waiter had to ask the chef first does not inherently make OP an asshole, that part doesn\u2019t even make sense. \n\nAlso, not to be rude, but I don\u2019t see what the opinion of a waitress (the sister) has to do with anything here. The only person who would be inconvenienced by OPs request was the kitchen.

Perfectly reasonable request, it's not like you demanded anything.", "NTA. You asked, the chef agreed. You didn't demand it or ask for something ridiculous. It is literally a single ingredient swap.

Waiter could have said no. I personally would only order something off the menu if it is not a busy night though. Working in a kitchen is so stressfull so an extra dish adds some stress. So I do understand where your sister comes from. But they could have said no.", "  I lived in Italy for a short while. There was a very nice Italian restaurant locally that did not have what I wanted, much like you. I asked for a very specific Italian dish that is known in Italy and the waiter went out and checked just as yours did. I didn't even ask for the traditional version but mixed it up a bit with an alteration of the way I liked it done.  He came back and said sure. Some short time later the chef came out and asked me about how I knew to order this dish and how delighted he was to make it for me. I told him about swimming out to collect muscles at Rimini and how much I loved this dish.  Later when I would go I would ask the waiter if Chef Roberto was there and if he was (he always was) I would tell the waiter to ask him to make my dish. Invariably he would come out for a moment to say hello and chat. A free glass of wine or a desert was not uncommon.  It didn't hurt that I tipped 50% or more.  I am sure there are some chefs that bridle at any change but I can tell you that at least some of them are very pleased to have somebody ask for something a bit different and you know they will be making it just a little special simply because it IS a little special.  I have never hesitated to ask for something off the menu, particularly in fine dining where I know it's not just an assembly line.", "NTA. They had the ingredients. It not like you were asking for something they did not have or know how to make. The chef had the right to say no.", "NTA for sure. You asked if they can do the thing, they agreed. I see no point to agrue about\n\nI go to one indian restaurant, and i have my own special meal.

It's not like you went to a Vegan place and made the ask.  If you ask and they say no, you have the answer, but if you don't ask you'll never know.  Your sister must not work at an accommodating restaurant if that's her position or she has no conception that veal parm = chicken parm/ chicken * veal and it is not a different dish to be created.", "NTA, your sister\u2019s wired way too tight", "NTA this is done at any restaurant - you can ask if something is available to be made.", "I suppose I get where she's coming from, but like a friend always says. \"Don't ask, don't get\" There was no harm in asking, if they didn't want to do it, they would have said no. As it is, they said yes. NTA", "NTA. It wasn't that bad of a request and the chef didn't think so either.", "If it\u2019s not crazy busy in the kitchen cooks enjoy something different. Probably had fun making it.", "NTA - While I have seen \"No substitutions please\" printed on a few menus, it's either a super fancy place with a prix fixe menu or else it's a fast food place. Anyone that is called \"chef\" needs to be able to do basic substitutions like this. It's not like you asked for a Baked Alaska.", "NTA. I\u2019m a waitress and it\u2019s really common to do this. Like you said, you didn\u2019t ask for a whole new dish from scratch", "NTA for the request.  Every cook I\u2019ve worked with would refuse a request that was actually inconvenient. Same dish, different protein, which is already available?  No problem.", "NTA\n\nIn a good restaurant they actually COOK the food and don't just heat it up.\n\nThey might have sauces and other stuff prepared in advance obviously but the actual dish is cooked and assembled when ordered.\n\nObviously the waitress had to confirm that the Veal Parm could be accommodated but there is absolutely no reason why any \"real\" restaurant wouldn't accommodate it. The prep and ingredients are identical to Chicken Parm except for the obvious substitution of veal for chicken.", "NTA, if it was an issue they'd just say no.", "This sounds like a question for people on a restaurant sub, because while it seems fine to me, I'd never do it, and would take the word of people in the industry on whether it is bad or not.\n\nBut I can't be the only one thinking you were wondering if you were an asshole for eating veal.", "NTA if the chef said it was ok then it was. If they couldn\u2019t do it then they would have said. You didn\u2019t demand or insist just asked if it was possible. Possibly the place your sister works has a very firm policy to not make menu changes but obviously this restaurant was happy to do it.", "Out of the 6 people saying you are half of them gave no reason and half said it was because you were eating veal which I find hilarious. NTA btw.", "NTA I think you were right that it was an easy adjustment for the chef and if they didn't feel comfortable making it they would have said no. The yes says they were confident they could and do it well enough to make you happy.", "NTA\n\nIt does no harm to ask politely.\n\nIf it is an absurd question, the server will just say no, or will waste a minute of their time asking the kitchen and getting a no from them.\n\nMaybe it is a simple request, or one the chef is happy to oblige, and you get the meal you want.\n\nAs long as you are polite and accepting of the answer you are given, I see no issue.", "NTA. It\u2019s as simple as swapping out for a different cut of meat.", "NTA, but that doesn't mean that the staff was happy to do it.  Just that they did.", "NTA, they had all the component parts and the relevant technique on the menu, so you weren't waltzing in there and asking for a pulled pork sandwich lol.", "NTA for what you asked, that didn't seem like a major inconvenience for the kitchen by all means.\n\nbut eating veal.. i dunno. i would find that questionable", "NTA: that's an easy dish the way they described the menu. I bet they do a veal Parm as a special from time to time since nothing extra needs to be prepped.\n\nEasy ask and back when I worked in the kitchen I wouldn't have thought twice about it.", "NTA, and you are right, the chef could have said no and it seem like you would have been fine with ordering something else. I wouldn't say your sister is an AH but I do agree that she was stuck in her waitress mindset. I can't say that I understand because I'm not a waiter/waitress myself but I believe not all restaurants are the same so it certainly does not hurt to ask for any changes and the worse thing that could have happen is a simple no.", "NTA I used to serve too and sure it can be a pain in the ass but it\u2019s really not all that hard especially if chef is down for it", "NTA your sister is a waitress not a chef, she needs to stay in her lane. I assure you if the chef didn't want to make it, they wouldn't. A swap like this is no big deal.", "NTA", "NTA at all! Chefs love that! If they could not, the chef would not permit them to take the order. And more places need Yummy Veal Parm!", "NTA. \nI regularly visit a small Italian place and order the same dish every time which os a modified version of their fettuccine bolognese by substituting angel hair pasta and adding grilled shrimp. The first time I asked for this the server even commented how appealing that sounded. She told me on another trip she had it for herself and loved it. \nIts not like you asked for Chinese fried rice at the Italian place. Your sister sounds like she is a bit of a try hard because of her job.", "NTA. There's no harm in politely asking.  Unless your waitress sister is also the chef at the restsurant she works at, her opinion on this is moot.  It's not the wait person's call to make.", "NTA.  I don't see why your sister had an issue here.  Your request was actually very simple, and the chef said they could accommodate you.

Veal comes from young calves who are confined and killed at just a few months old. These sensitive, intelligent animals experience extreme cruelty and deprivation during their short lives. Choosing this dish directly financially supports these abusive practices. \n\nWhile the kitchen workflow or menu substitutions may be minor concerns, the animal welfare issues are severe and should be the top priority.
