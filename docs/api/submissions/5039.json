It was a gift to you from your dad, saying that you could put it together with your girlfriend. She saw the note, not sure why she thought it would be ok to open and put it together without you.", "NTA. She not only stole a precious memory-making moment from both of you, she also completely took over your gift and didn't care enough about you to even ask if it would be okay. I get that she probably thought it would be a nice surprise, but she was EXTREMELY selfish in her thinking.\n\nI'd show her this post and comments later to, hopefully, show her how wrong she was for stealing the experience of sharing building the gift. If she doesn't learn to care about YOUR feelings and what's important to you now, she never will and it will end up destroying the whole relationship.", "Good god NTA. That\u2019s very rude of her.", "Firstly, I'm sorry for your loss. I also lost my Mum this year so I feel as you do about Christmas. It's going to be very hard adjusting to a 'new normal'.\n\nYour father's thoughtful gift was clearly hugely important to you, and your GF crossed a line in putting it together as if it was her own present. It is possible that she thought she was doing you some sort of kindness in putting it all together, but since you've stated that it isn't the first time this sort of thing has happened, I think it's fair to you to be annoyed about it.\n\nI don't want to immediately assume that your GF is an asshole, as it's possible that she struggles with social cues and doesn't understand normal boundaries, so I think - for both of your benefits - you need to spell the following out to her:\n\na) This was a gift for **you** from **your** father, therefore it should be entirely up to you when you choose to build the kit. She was out of line even opening the box without your say so.\n\nb) Just because it was suggested as an activity for you both (and you agreed this would be a nice thing to do), it's still **your** gift. You would have been within your moral right to complete the set on your own at a time of your choosing and not involve her at all. It doesn't sound like you would have done this, but it was still your choice to make.\n\nc) Building this set might have helped you with the grieving process. Grief is highly individual and cannot be predicted. But as well as taking your gift as her own, she's potentially also removed an opportunity for you to take a step forward with your own healing.\n\nSo, you are NTA under any circumstances. You are also not being petty or emotional. You are grieving. It takes time. It takes support. And support is often a significant other not saying or doing anything, but just being there.", "Absolutely NTA, Lego is all about the excitement opening the box, going through tge manual, creating something that's new and \"never been here before\". Your gf took that from you and it wouldn't be the same if it was deconstructed and put together again. It was your present from your dad, she should never have laid a finger on it.", "NTA remove the context of your mother\u2019s passing and your GF is still the AH. Even if it was just a gift from Person A to Person B, and Person C opened and built the Lego set, Person C would still be the huge AH. I can\u2019t even wrap my head around *why* she would do it without you. And I can understand not destroying it for you to rebuild because the \u201cmagic\u201d is gone.\nETA I\u2019m sorry for your loss", "NTA. Did you ask why she did it alone despite seeing the note and also it not being her present? This is extremely rude and disrespectful.", "NTA. What on earth was her reasoning? There is literally no justification for her doing this.\n\nIt\u2019s such a selfish arsehole move I\u2019m shocked. So rude. \n\nI know you likely to feel tempted to let it go because \u201cit\u2019s just Lego\u201d, but honestly it says so much about her as a person and it\u2019s so breathtakingly self-absorbed that I really think you should stand your ground and really think about the rest of your relationship because I highly doubt it\u2019s the first time she has disregarded you.", "NTA.\n\nYou're not being petty. Even if the gift didn't have sentimental value, it was gifted to *you*. She completely crossed the line. I truly hope she is able to realize that.\n\nI'm really sorry for your loss. I hope the holidays won't be too unbearable.", "NTA. This was a very sentimental present to you from your dad. Just because the note said you both could have fun putting it together, it doesn\u2019t mean she gets to put it together on her own. I don\u2019t know what was going through her head, but it wasn\u2019t ok for her to put it together without you.\n\nSit down with her and communicate how this whole thing upset you. If she apologizes, then she got the point and you can take it from there.\n\nBut if she gets defensive and refuses to apologize, that gives you a big hint of her real self. You cut ties and move on.", "NTA. Yes it\u2019s just a lego, but she was completely insensitive to what it represented. It should be so obvious that it was not cool to open it and put it together without you. I would speak to her about it. I hope she is compassionate to you.", "NTA. She took a healing and a memorable experience and turned into a gift from herself. She even saw the note, but even if she didn't, communication is key and she disregarded that. She should've talked to you. You are not being petty at all. And it's perfectly reasonable to be emotional because, well, the gift itself was supposed to be.\n\nHonestly, I would start a serious talk about communication. It needs to be had.\n\nI am sorry for your loss", "NTA - That was rude and insensitive of her, especially her acting like she doesn't know why you might be upset about her doing it all by herself. Connection to your mother or not, she shouldn't have put YOUR gift together without you.", "INFO : what's her reason for doing it ?", "nta.  My husband still builds legos.  Everyone knows the fun is in building it.  He has 2 sets in the closet and I would never touch them.", "NTA- it\u2019s a gift from your dad with a note saying it can help to distract you, she shouldn\u2019t have done it while you were sleeping without even mentioning it to you", "NTA, that was a terrible move", "Nta,\nI couldn't imagine putting together someone else's lego.  She was a total AH.", "NTA Ignoring all of the sentimental bits, it was still really rude of her to put it together by herself. It was YOUR gift that she was allowed to help out with. Nothing she did was in the spirit of the gift, or Christmas for that matter. I can kind of understand if she got carried away, but acting like she doesn\u2019t see what she did wrong is weird. How does she think this was ok??", "Tell her to take it apart completely and put it back in bags like it was. That was beyond insensitive. It's in the cruel category.", "NTA\n\nIt was your present not hers. Also she literally said herself you can build the set together but then does so on her own.", "I\u2019m pretty sure r/lego would like a word with your girlfriend.\n\nShe\u2019s needs to take it entirely apart and sort it back into the original bags. This is the only way forward.\n\nThis was not okay.. How could she possibly think this was okay? Is she usually incredibly selfish and doesn\u2019t consider how her actions will impact you? Or is she just not the brightest bulb on the Christmas tree? If someone really doesn\u2019t understand legos, and maybe isn\u2019t a rocket scientist, I can kinda see them thinking it\u2019s \u201chelpful\u201d to put it together? Like maybe if she\u2019s never heard of them before and though it was meant to be an art piece more of something you enjoy putting together?", "This was very rude and insensitive of your gf. I would suggest sitting down and explaining to her why it hurt you and she should hopefully understand. And take it back apart again. Even if you aren't ready to reassemble it right now, you might be in the future.", "NTA. The joy of a lego set (aka a puzzle) is putting it together - not the finished product. You have to lack even a basic level of common sense to steal that joy from the recipient.", "NTA, yikes that\u2019s rude", "NTA and no you aren't being petty. I feel like this means a lot to you and if I were in your shoes I'd 100% throw a fit and refuse to spend Christmas with a person like her. Rude af, girl bye.", "NTA. It is your gift and she was invited to possibly help you. She did it herself without even asking you. What she did was rude and hurtful.", "NTA- the note from your father articulated what he thought the gift would be good for (a distraction and that you both could have fun). You said we. It was your gift, and it's a Lego set for an adult so it's more like a puzzle than like installing a TV or something. The finished item is nice but a lot (most?) of the joy is in figuring it out.", "NTA, and I\u2019m actually shocked that she did that & doesn\u2019t get why you\u2019re upset", "NTA She did something incredibly shitty and is apparently clueless about it. Sentimental or not, you don\u2019t put together someone else\u2019s Christmas without permission", "Personally, this would've been a deal breaker for me. I am all for building puzzles and lego together, but to start and complete it without me is just so insulting. This would've been an excellent way for you to process your grief. Each piece you put together with the excitement of figuring out where it went and simultaneously reminiscing your memories with your mom. At least that's how it would've been for me This was such a dick move that I don't think I would've been able to come back from it. I can't speak for you but wow. Just, wow. \n\nEven if she replaced it, it wouldn't be the same. To me, the entire emotion that the gift withheld would've been gone. It would no longer be a sentimental piece from an estranged dad connecting with his son regarding his late mother. It would be a replacement marking a GF's egregious blunder. Some things are not replaceable or fixable, and this might be it. She's not a bad person but what she did feels like a huge violation. I'm not telling you to break up or stay together. I'm just telling you how I would feel if I was in your shoes. I wish you well in what you choose because no decision you make regarding this situation would make you an AH unless you get violent, which is unlikely. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "NTA that was pretty inconsiderate of her.", "NTA how selfish of your GF.", "NTA. building the tree was not just to have the finished product. it was a chance at a healing moment for you turned into a tangible memory that you both built together. it seems it all went over her head. sorry for your loss. grief is\u2026 something else.", "NTA your can feel upset and sad but you have to express this to your girlfriend. If you think she did it on purpose to hurt you than that\u2019s something you need to deal with. But it sounds she she got excited and made a mistake. Ask her to disassemble the tree and put it together again.", "That was unbelievably shitty of her even without the context of the gift. Who puts together someone else\u2019s Lego gift?! Add in the context and what she has done is unconscionable. But the fact that she\u2019s gaslighting you into thinking you\u2019re the jerk is REALLY concerning. Also the fact that you had to qualify \u201cshe\u2019s been supportive\u201d with \u201cfor the most part\u201d. She sounds pretty selfish. You are NTA and I am so sorry for your loss.

Part of the fun of Legos is putting them together. \n\nHave you asked why she thought this was a good idea? How was this kind to you?", "The gift isn't the finished product, girlfriend. (show this to her) if it was, it wouldn't be so expensive! The gift is hours and hours putting a Lego set together. It's like buying someone theater tickets and going to the show and then showing them the playbill and saying, why aren't you grateful? UGH as a Lego girl I would be furious. Have her disassemble it back into the numbered bags so you can experience it as if it was unopened. And if not, dump her, lawyer up, gym, or whatever people say. Get your brick on!", "NTA.  My dad died this year and I would love to have a project to get into to take my mind off things. I'm sorry about your mom and about your bonsai \n\nI'm wondering though if your girlfriend is dumb instead of cruel? Maybe she thought that the whole point was for you to *have* the bonsai and wanted to get all that annoying assembly out of the way so you could just enjoy it? If that's true, you need to talk to her. (I wouldn't, I'd leave her ass because I don't like the taste of moron in the morning but that's me not you)\n\nIf she isn't dumb, she was cruel AF and I'd open *all* of her Christmas gifts tonight while she sleeps and use or ruin them. Wear the makeup, stretch out the shoes, eat the cookies, watch the movies\n\nOr you could talk to her, find out what in the actual fuck she was thinking and go from there", "NTA ..

She knew you were going to do it, so what possessed her to take that away from you.", "NTA \n\nAnd your girlfriend is secretly the Grinch, well at least this year she is.  \n\nHow sweet and considerate of your father to send such a thoughtful gift and try to focus on that sentiment, while watching her  tearing the legos apart so you can rebuild it.", "I would be f*cking fuming. NTA.", "My boyfriend (big lego fan) says \"Dump her\".", "She should take it apart, put in a pile for you to put together. Then she should leave because you will never forgive her for this atrocity.

The whole point of Lego is to put it together, the ability to display it afterwards is a nice bonus.\n\nI would find out why she did it if you want to move forward in the relationship. Could it be that she doesn't understand the hobby and thought that she'd done the \"boring\" hard part so you and your father would have a nice memory of your mother already made for Christmas? You say she was grinning, so this explanation or a variation on it is the only acceptable one, really. Was she grinning because she thought she'd done something nice, or because she knew it would hurt you? Ask her.\n\nIf possible, also ask her for a replacement to rebuild from scratch so you can continue with your Christmas plans with your dad (he doesn't have to know), and perhaps the existing bonsai could be packaged up carefully and donated?", "LEGO is all about the building process. It's not like your dad had given you IKEA furniture, where the end result is the only thing that's important.

NTA", "NTA but your girlfriend is! Wtf?", "NTA She opened the gift your dad bought you and put it together without you.

This is a relationship ending event. It seems so small, but says everything about the character and emotional makeup of your girlfriend. So selfish. She sounds like a child.

There\u2019s nothing the gf can do to fix this tbh.", "I mean he shouldn't really have to explain why he's upset about her putting together his gift without him but I agree she might just really be an idiot and if she is apologetic after he explains why she shouldn't have done what she did then things are salvageable. She still ruined the experience of that specific gift from his father though. Taking it apart and redoing it doesn't really cut it.", "I would be interested in hearing those multiple scenarios because I can\u2019t even imagine one.", "You are wrong on so many levels it's almost breathtaking.", "Ok what's one scenario where it's ok to build a gift given to someone else that has a note that's says it be good for the two of you to do it together?  \n\nLet's also remember they had the gift less than 24 hours", "Is there anything you won't minimize?  Seriously, your awareness is appalling.", "It was a gift from his father. It was very clearly not a gift for both of them, rather a gift for his son that both of them could enjoy, if the son wanted. That shouldn't' have to be spelled out to anyone, especially the gf. Her asking \"what happened?\" instead of immediately realizing she shouldn't have built HIS gift is a red flag.  Therapy is invaluable, don't get me wrong, but it can't always be there to guide you in everyday situations. You either have common sense or you don't. If the gf can't understand what she did was wrong without paying someone to explain it to her than there is a serious problem here.", "That totally could be it but once he showed that he was upset she should have apologized as it's basic human decency that you don't touch someone else's gift and she should have realized that she took a risk that backfired on her. If she apologizes then it was an honest mistake and she'll learn from it. If she doubles down and tries to make him the bad guy then he's got a serious problem on his hands.", "I just get the feeling she\u2019s not that bright rather than malicious.", "He said in his post he was being  petty, granted he didn't elaborate so IDK what that means...", "Then OP should be single.

Much of what is in the OP's post, the girlfriend wouldn't automatically know.\n\nFor instance, the note said 'a distraction' but OP gets the context that it's the assembling process that is the distraction...girlfriend may have thought the completed object would be the distraction. So she completed it as quickly as possible so it could be that distraction as quickly as possible.\n\nShe was grinning, thinking it was a good thing she did. OP even admits that girlfriend doesn't know what was wrong. In no way was girlfriend being malicious. It's clear from her \"body language\" (even though we're just getting a second-hand account of it) that she was trying to do something good for OP and it messed up and she didn't understand why.\n\nAnother similar miscommunication is the girlfriend may in fact think that this was assembled \"together\" because they live together and this is an 'ours' thing even though she did all the work. She probably thinks she is 'sharing' this with him in this way.\n\nIf she washes all the dishes does that make them her dishes or are they still dishes they both own together? Again, if she was unaware that the actual assembling *process* was the gift, it's likely she looks at it this way.\n\nI know lego fanatics so I get the fun is in the building and not so much in the final product. But not everyone thinks that way.\n\nAnd another scenario, is the \"hey I fixed this thing that I know meant a lot to you\" upsetting the person who wanted to leave it broken and/or fix it themselves, for previously-uncommunicated sentimental reasons.\n\nDo I know this is for certain what happened? No, but again her grinning instantly turning into \"what's wrong\" concern says to me that she was not malicious at all. Exactly what form her non-maliciousness takes, no idea, but I would be very much surprised if further details prove that she was intentionally trying to cause harm.", "What a great explanation with several specific details, an absolutely convincing argument that will for sure stand the test of time.", "There may be a semantics thing happening.\n\nIn the OP it's implied the dad is giving a gift for OP to put together with his girlfriend.\n\nI feel like many people are saying that this was a gift meant for OP and the father to work on together.\n\nIf it's the latter, then yes, the girlfriend was an AH.\n\nEdit: Except the OP makes it clear with the \"first Christmas as a couple\" thing that this was meant as a girlfriend + OP present.\n\nIt's entirely possible that the girlfriend sees building it by herself and sharing the finished product with him as \"building it with him.\" Because she built it, and she's with him.\n\nYou can disagree, and that's valid. But she's not a mindreader. She can't be expected to know that's how you'd feel about it. She can do better next time, now that she knows you feel that way. Etc. ***Communicate***.", "Exactly what is being minimized here? What am I unaware of?\n\nYour claims lack detail.", ">a gift for his son that both of them could enjoy, if the son wanted\n\nAnd the son talked about it with the gf and he clearly made the choice that he intended to enjoy it with her.\n\nShe just misunderstood what that meant.\n\n>Her asking \"what happened?\" instead of immediately realizing she shouldn't have built HIS gift is a red flag.\n\nYou're right, but not in the way you're insinuating. It's a sign that miscommunication happened and needs to be resolved.\n\n>Therapy is invaluable, don't get me wrong, but it can't always be there to guide you in everyday situations.\n\nIt wasn't specifically for this situation that I was recommending therapy, it was for depression in general.\n\nLetting small things like this get you down to the point that \"there's no way for this to get better\" feels like the outcome, is something a therapist should be helping you. Can the OP picture a situation where this gets better? What is the girlfriend supposed to do? Apologize? Of course she will, but...is that actually going to make him feel any better?\n\nIt reads like his reaction would be \"it's too late now\" or \"it's ruined\" or \"it wouldn't be the same\" to take it apart and rebuild it with her. Those are the kinds of thoughts that someone in depression (or grief, kinda same thing) would have. And therapy would help with those kinds of thoughts.\n\nIf, as suggested by someone else, this is just grief, and it will pass, then that's fine. But therapy doesn't exactly hurt just because you're grieving instead of depressed. It can still help.\n\n>You either have common sense or you don't. If the gf can't understand what she did was wrong without paying someone to explain it to her than there is a serious problem here.\n\nThe therapy would be for the OP, not the gf. The gf doesn't need therapy. Kind of rude of you to make that switch.\n\nIt is totally acceptable for her to need an explanation from OP in order to understand what OP feels and why OP feels it. She isn't a mindreader.\n\nEveryone starts off without having common sense, until they do. And OP explaining this to her would be all it takes.\n\nShe wasn't malicious. She wasn't an AH. I flat out refuse to give anyone who wasn't malicious an AH rating. If you disagree, you do you.", "I know. I was disagreeing and saying it\u2019s not petty.", "Thoughtful? By opening his gift that was sent by his father and reminded him of his mother who just passed away this year? How is that thoughtful? Plus it was something they could bond doing together.", ">girlfriend may have thought the completed object would be the distraction. \n\nLol how long would a Lego bonsai distract you for? \n\n>She probably thinks she is 'sharing'\n\nThis is even more ridiculous than the above \n\n>If she washes all the dishes does that make them her dishes or are they still dishes they both own together?\n\nThis is just stupid, she wouldn't say they did them together, well unless she's incapable of understanding basic words", "I\u2019ll grant you that her demeanor does imply she thought she was doing something good, but I struggle to believe that she didn\u2019t know Lego was about the assembly. It\u2019s not a bike. It\u2019s more like a jigsaw puzzle. Sure, you might display the finished product, but the fun is in putting it together. Has she really never heard of Lego? Or has no understanding of how people play with Lego? Even if you have just a passing awareness, would it make sense to think the whole point was the finished product and it didn\u2019t matter who assembled it? Does she think it\u2019s sold in 800 pieces because it\u2019s easier to ship or something?\n\nI\u2019m the original post Op says they talked about assembling it together later. OP does not mention expressing any wish that it was pre-assembled so he wouldn\u2019t have to do it. \n\nAssembling someone else\u2019s gift doesn\u2019t become something you did together just because you live together. Like, using using your dishes example, if I do the dishes does the fact that my partner lives in my house mean we did them together? Actually doing the dishes together means you did them together. Yeah, the dishes are \u201cours\u201d, but being in the same building doesn\u2019t mean we worked on them together when I loaded the dishwasher last night. And, my parents\u2019 wedding china is mine and my partner\u2019s grandparents\u2019 china is not, even though we\u2019ve shared both sets for 20 years. \n\nMy partner just bought a guitar, but there\u2019s no world in which I think of it as ours. If they try eating the chocolate in my stocking, we\u2019re going to war. \n\nThe note from Dad said they could assemble that kit together, not \u2018maybe gf will assemble it for you\u2019.", "I think the latter to.  So if the gift is for both of them, with instructions that they should build it together, what scenario is it reasonable that she say screw OP I'll build this myself?", "What I interpreted from what's stated in the post is the gift was solely for OP with simply a suggestion from their dad that OP and their GF could put it together. The present itself was not addressed to both of them though. Due to that I find it rude this GF would take a present not for her and build the entire thing. We can have the best of intentions but if those lead to actions that hurt others the intentions matter diddly squat. So I do think GF needs to apologize and not double down. She got it wrong and she's human so that happens sometimes, but this isn't something she needs to be right about. Grief is difficult and sometimes unpredictable in what can randomly cause it so I'm surprised GF here even risked messing with something sentimental.", "Yeah but for the girlfriend and him to build TOGETHER, the together is the important part.\nAnd Lego is a building toy, for most people the fun part is building the thing, not having someone else assemble it for you.", "Have you read his update? Have you realized you were completely wrong about him just having to communicate why he's upset?", "Oh yeah, I understand that, like the man's grieving, it's not petty to feel big things over the lego set, since it's not actually \\*about\\* the lego set.  \n\n\nIt's not just the dang yogurt here.", "It's your comment, \"There is *nothing* the gf can do to fix this...\" \n\n\nIt just sounds emotionally immature.", "Congratulations, you are now every single person on earth and nobody is any different from you in any other way.\n\nI wasn't saying she'd be right in making those assumptions. Just that they are natural assumptions that many human beings make and she's not out of the ordinary for making them, nor is she an AH for making them, especially when OP doesn't communicate otherwise until *after* the fact.", ">I struggle to believe that she didn\u2019t know Lego was about the assembly. It\u2019s not a bike. It\u2019s more like a jigsaw puzzle.\n\nI have personally encountered people who see Lego as 'the toy is the finished product.'\n\nIn fact the Lego movie, ironically, covered both types of people. The \"build it to the instructions and NOW you have the toy\" people and the \"build whatever you want and have fun along the way\" people. Comparing and contrasting those two types of people was the whole theme of the movie, lol.\n\n>I\u2019m the original post Op says they talked about assembling it together later.\n\nAgain, I have known people who have a different concept of what 'together' means. I gave the dishes example earlier. She may be seeing the finished product as the thing they share together, not the building process.\n\nThe same conversations have happened between people who want to 'share' a show together and don't make it clear that they want to actually watch the show for the first time together. So they get upset when one person goes off and watches it without them, thinking \"I'm still going to watch it with you\" or \"I'm still going to discuss the show with you\" and thinking that's 'sharing' it. It's a common miscommunication that happens all the time.\n\n>if I do the dishes does the fact that my partner lives in my house mean we did them together?\n\nYet again this is a switch in focus from the ownership of the dishes (as was the example I actually gave) to the process of 'doing them' together (which you've twisted it to). It's the same basic thing as the lego question: Is the joy in the building or the complete product?\n\n*Some* people exist who are different, and they're not AHs just for having a different outlook. If OP had communicated and made clear, and she did it anyway, she'd be the AH. It, sadly, wasn't as clear as OP maybe hoped or assumed it was. Hence, miscommunication. That's it.\n\n>The note from Dad said they could assemble that kit together, not \u2018maybe gf will assemble it for you\u2019.\n\nAnd maybe the girlfriend didn't see any difference between those two things, because there are people out there in the world like that who wouldn't, unless you, y'know, communicate and make it clear.\n\nI've encountered people like this girlfriend and I have empathy to understand why she did what she did and why it wasn't malicious. That's why I ruled the way I did. She wasn't malicious, so she's not an AH.\n\nIf you lack that empathy or awareness of that type of people, your ruling is your own.", ">but was going to be a sweet bonding activity for our first Christmas Day together as a couple\n\nThis is the part that makes me think it was a \"girlfriend + OP\" present and not a \"dad + OP\" present. (I edited my previous comment after seeing that part again.)\n\nWhy would it be bonding with his girlfriend to build it with his dad? Makes more sense that it would be bonding with his girlfriend to build it with his girlfriend.", "Even if it was just about the Lego he wouldn't be overreacting", "There isn\u2019t. They can get back the experience of doing legos together and having Christmas together.

This is your *partner* not a roommate.", "It doesn't matter what everyone else thinks it meant.\n\nIt matters what the girlfriend thinks it meant.\n\nI don't believe that she knew it meant that. She was grinning and happy that she thought she had done a good thing, and didn't understand why the OP was upset.\n\nIf she had been malicious, she wouldn't have been confused or concerned for the OP. So, it's clear she wasn't malicious.\n\nYou could argue that she lacked common sense. But even if you accept that judgment, lacking common sense doesn't make you an AH, imo.", "And it was his mother."]}
