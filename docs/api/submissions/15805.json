{"id": 15805, "submission_id": "130bag2", "title": "AITA for wanting to buy my college's hoodie?", "selftext": "I'm a high school senior who recently got into Carnegie Mellon's Engineering program. Tbh it wasn't one of my top choices, but it\u2019s still one of the best engineering programs in the world. My parents, however, are less than pleased. My dad didn't even know what CMU was when I got in, when I told him I got in he immediately checked its US News ranking and laughed it off as a shit school. My father is a close-minded and traditional man, and he thinks college admissions are the way they were 30 years ago--back when MIT, Stanford, Berkeley (his alma mater) and the Ivies were the only good colleges, back when USC was considered a backwater state school, and back when a 1550, a 4.0, and some decent extracurriculars could carry you into Harvard. He had convinced himself I was smart enough to get into an \"elite\" college, so when I got rejected and waitlisted everywhere else he freaked out. To him, CMU was the same as some trashy state school, an embarrassment to his legacy, and I think my mom agrees.\n\nAfter committing to CMU, naturally the issue of finances followed. As you all know, colleges are expensive, and almost all families have to go to great lengths to pay tuition. After I committed, my dad had a \"talk\" with me where he kept likening CMU to community college, and stated \"out of the goodness of his heart\" he was willing to pay 25k/yr for my tuition (CMU's full tuition is 85k/yr and we didn't get any aid). Now that seems pretty generous, but we live in Silicon Valley and my dad works as a lawyer; he owns several high-value properties and has invested a lot of money in stocks. My mom doesn't work but takes out loans on expensive cars (Tesla, Volvo) and shops at Zara, UO, and Whole Foods. So they could pay more than 25k/yr if they tried. But fine, it's their money, I'm not entitled to any of it. \n\nNow most colleges will send hoodies/sweatshirts after a student commits, but CMU sent us a flag instead. I was pretty annoyed, because I could use some new clothes and I wanted to wear some CMU swag for College Day at my high school. So I asked my mom if I could buy the CMU hoodie online for $30. She refused, claiming she was \"penny-pinching\" for my expensive-ass tuition and I shouldn't waste $30 on \"trivial things.\" I told her that was pretty hypocritical considering her luxurious lifestyle; furthermore, they were paying 25k/yr, which is like 2% of their yearly income. It's fine if she doesn't want to pay for my college, but now she was judging me for wanting to drop $30 of my own money (I worked full-time over summer) on a piece of clothing I need anyway. She screamed that I was a spoiled, ungrateful piece of shit, a parasite, and a disappointment to our family; she hasn't said a word to me since, and neither has my dad.\n\nIDK what to think. On one hand, it IS their own money, and I have no right to it. On the other hand, if they don't want to pay for my college, then they should say that outright instead of claiming they're \"penny-pinching.\" AITA?", "created_utc": 1682574349, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/130bag2/aita_for_wanting_to_buy_my_colleges_hoodie/", "score": 70, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
