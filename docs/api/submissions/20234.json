There is no active lifeguard or anyone really monitoring it like most apartment pools. \n\nOn Saturday my boyfriend and I went to hangout at the pool around 2 PM. We get there and it\u2019s packed.  Like wayyy too packed. I knew this couldn\u2019t all be residents. There were maybe 25-30 Hispanic people with beer(glass bottles of modelo as well, double rule break, with the alcohol AND glass), loud music, and they were also using both of the grills on the patio. After investigating further it looked like one of the small families that I\u2019ve seen around the complex was having a birthday party for their kid. \n\nOur complex technically has a rule that all non residents must be checked in at the office to use the pool, but there\u2019s no way they enforce this and nobody really pays attention to that rule. BUT a whole ass birthday party?! The entire pool was filled with kids. It doesn\u2019t specifically say no parties but it says be respectful of others spaces and not to hog items like the grills, hot tub, umbrella tables. My bf and I tried to lay out in the corner but it wasn\u2019t working. After another couple told us how displeased they were with this party too, my bf suggested we say something. We left and stopped by the front office and told them about the party. \n\nAbout an hour later we started seeing all them leaving the pool. It looked like the party was shut down. This morning we got a note on our door from the hosts of the party. Idek how they knew it was us or what unit we lived in but that\u2019s beside the point. The note called us assholes for what we did and now said they are under a \u201clease review\u201d where the office could decide to evict them if they want. So they thanked us for potentially getting a poor, small family kicked out. I said we weren\u2019t the only ones who had a problem and if we didn\u2019t do it they would have eventually gotten caught. I also told them that whatever happens is their own fault for blatantly breaking the rules.

But there's a reason that the complex has these rules about pool use: liability. \n\nIf a guest's child gets cut with glass, the parents can hold the complex liable. If anyone gets into distress in the pool and there's no lifeguard and a bunch of people are too drunk to help, then the complex can be held liable. Because it's the complex's pool. If this happens, all residents are likely to lose the use of the pool, and rents might have to go up to cover the increase in insurance premiums for the payout(s). If there is insurance and the property doesn't have to be sold to cover a settlement.\n\nThis goes beyond the fact that this is a shared space that other residents wanted to use but couldn't because there were too many non-residents in the pool area. And the big rule of thumb about apartment life is not preventing your neighbors from utilizing their home. The pool is a part of that. And the management ensures that everyone is not unduly burdened by other residents. Don't like that? Don't rent.\n\nHave to rent and don't want to risk losing your lease?

They rephrased OP\u2019s sentence there: in the original sentence, OP included that the family was Hispanic and the beer was Modelo. The comment is showing that if you take out \u201cHispanic\u201d and \u201cModelo,\u201d you\u2019re still conveying the important parts. The only reason to include those words would be to convey something else.", "You ever watch \"this fool\" ? Awesome show", "\"It's unnecessary and irrelevant but how dare you question including a detail for being unnecessary and irrelevant\"", "Idk that\u2019s actually a pretty good argument but OP is still racist and went about the situation wrong", "Yep. Some people are assholes and you have no way of knowing who will be reasonable and who will escalate for no reason. If there\u2019s a third party whose job is to enforce rules, I\u2019m not stepping in to do it.

If it was for 1 day I'd say the same thing.", "It was literally a one time thing you will live.", "Why did you ask if you were the asshole if you weren\u2019t willing to accept that a huge number of people would say that you were. YTA for that too, in addition to being a snitch", "In this day and age you never know how confronting someone, even very politely, will turn out. You have a large group of people who are drinking. Confronting them and telling them they are doing something wrong could go bad very quickly if just one of them decides they don't like what you are saying. \n\nAnd the complex can't take action if they don't know it is happening. Where I live the office never has more than 2 employees in the office at any given time and there are lots of shared areas that are no where near the office. The only way they can know about something is if they are told.", "I don't know what you mean. The apartment is taking action, the family is in trouble with them. That's how the apartments sees who's causing problems and who isn't. Most apartment buildings don't have on site staff. That means that the rest of the building police is each other. Would I have said anything? For a one-time thing, no. But would I have thrown in my child a birthday party at the apartment pool knowing that I was breaking that many rules? Hell no. And what I have gone up and confronted a group of 30 people? No. I like being alive.", "And? Follow the lease agreement. I wouldn't either, not trying to get into a possible open confrontation with a ton of people. Also with the quantity of people it sounds like, you think they'd just up and leave? I highly doubt it.", "Your last question.\nIt\u2019s not that they\u2019re all Hispanic it\u2019s that he only recognised a couple of them. You guys are grasping at straws to call op racist for giving context and saying he didn\u2019t recognise most of the people. He \u201cknew\u201d and raised it with the staff because it was causing him and others problems. It\u2019s not racist\n\nActually fucking crazy that you guys get \u201cracist\u201d from this.\n\nHe had an issue with an unknown group which he described as to let the reader understand what he was seeing.

So they broke the rules are were disrespecting other people and they\u2019re crying that there are consequences??? Are you so offended for them that rules no longer apply to non Caucasians?", "Wasn't it because the place was packed? When they're rules?", "a group of ~~Hispanics enjoying themselves~~\n\na group of people breaking the rules and being obnoxious/rude\\*\n\nFTFY", "Enforcement of rules is racist?", "All of you here debating about race calling and we hispanics don't  care, it's  actually funny when people think we get offended we have betfer things to think about", "You are right! \nWhy is it even relevant that they are Hispanic if not due to racism.", "Some states mandate that a portion of units be set aside and priced lower than the market price, specifically so that low-income families have an opportunity to be part of communities they'd otherwise be excluded from.  My state, NJ, is one of them.\n\nIt's possible these folks are lying, but it's certainly not a guarantee.", "What an icy thing to say. YTA clearly. Each response makes that clearer. Of course they knew it was you, you probably had a snotty look on your face as you marched off to dob that \"gasp\", they were using BOTH grills! The audacity! Most people would have chatted and enjoyed the vibe but you sound like you were afraid of Hispanic people to enjoy - why else would you specify their race at all as if this was a pertinent factor. What a joyless world this is.", "Does reading minds ever get tiring?", "The letter did scream victim mentality..", "If they live there then they can literally go the next day or hell they could wait 2-3 hrs tops. It\u2019s also not solely OPs pool soooo why did he feel the need to try and dictate what this family can and can\u2019t do somewhere they pay an arm and a leg to be? Also, OP admits that nobody actually follows the rules he only felt the need to complain because he saw a bunch of \u201cHispanic people drinking modelo\u201d. How does he know that other people at the birthday party don\u2019t live there? Oh that\u2019s right he doesn\u2019t. He just assumed instead of asking the family.", "And obviously this single interaction on the internet is evidence of that. A typed out Freudian Slip practically.", "Fun fact: It's \\*also\\* racist to assume that a group of Hispanic folks is going to be homophobic.", "What do hispanics have to do with that??", "Thats your call then to look the other way.  If you want to give up usage on an amenity you pay for and are entitled to use, its entirely on you to choose so.  But I cant begrudge OP for feeling dissatisfied when encountering another tenant abusing the privileges they are all entitled to", "You have every right to look away if that\u2019s how you would handle this situation but in no way should we feel *obligated* to look away.", "Sure I\u2019ll live but why should I need to tolerate it? It\u2019s equivalent to if I went to a bar and ordered top shelf liquor, and they gave me bottom shelf and told me \u201cyou will live\u201d while charging me the price for the top shelf.", "I wouldn\u2019t say a huge number. There\u2019s also many saying I\u2019m not the asshole.

Poor me, can\u2019t enjoy a shared space the way I want to.", "No, you scream victim mentality.", "\u201cI felt extremely put-upon by a child\u2019s birthday party but was afraid to talk to someone because I was scared they\u2019d beat me up.\u201d \n\nThe irony lmao", "Are you a mind reader? How do you know it\u2019s a Freudian slip and not a race thing?", "Yeah you\u2019re right", "Or that they would be violent\u2026", "I don\u2019t understand why you even posted here.", "So why did you post on this sub then? One of the rules of the sub is accepting your judgment.

It's literally one day. I can see if this happened multiple times, but once and you go to complain?! That's a bit ridiculous. Kids, music, and beer. AND it's a shared space. Big flipping deal.", "I mean, yeah, you are. It's an apartment. A part of apartment living is dealing with shared spaces and noises/people you might not want around all the time. Yes, this family was technically breaking a rule, so you are technically entitled to alerting the leasing office about them. However, unless this is a regular disruption, it makes you an asshole and not very neighborly.", "The world doesn\u2019t always configure itself to please you.

The rule is don't argue your judment, not don't argue if you have a resounding YTA.", "Acting like a human would be respecting the rules of your apartment complex, as to not hog the whole pool. That'd be showing your fellow tenants respect and common courtesy.", "A. Freudian slips aren't real\n\nB. You're accusing them of being racist over fucking nothing and pretending like you're the mentalist", "But can\u2019t you say the same exact thing to them?  Like the world doesn\u2019t configure itself to please you so you can\u2019t inconvenience all these other tenants by having your party?", "You\u2019re the one who mentioned Freudian slips buddy. If they aren\u2019t real then why did you call it a Freudian slip?\n\nAlso not pretending to be a mentalist. Have a license and have been practicing for 20 years", "YTA One party.
