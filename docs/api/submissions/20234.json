There is no active lifeguard or anyone really monitoring it like most apartment pools. \n\nOn Saturday my boyfriend and I went to hangout at the pool around 2 PM. We get there and it\u2019s packed.  Like wayyy too packed. I knew this couldn\u2019t all be residents. There were maybe 25-30 Hispanic people with beer(glass bottles of modelo as well, double rule break, with the alcohol AND glass), loud music, and they were also using both of the grills on the patio. After investigating further it looked like one of the small families that I\u2019ve seen around the complex was having a birthday party for their kid. \n\nOur complex technically has a rule that all non residents must be checked in at the office to use the pool, but there\u2019s no way they enforce this and nobody really pays attention to that rule. BUT a whole ass birthday party?! The entire pool was filled with kids. It doesn\u2019t specifically say no parties but it says be respectful of others spaces and not to hog items like the grills, hot tub, umbrella tables. My bf and I tried to lay out in the corner but it wasn\u2019t working. After another couple told us how displeased they were with this party too, my bf suggested we say something. We left and stopped by the front office and told them about the party. \n\nAbout an hour later we started seeing all them leaving the pool. It looked like the party was shut down. This morning we got a note on our door from the hosts of the party. Idek how they knew it was us or what unit we lived in but that\u2019s beside the point. The note called us assholes for what we did and now said they are under a \u201clease review\u201d where the office could decide to evict them if they want. So they thanked us for potentially getting a poor, small family kicked out. I said we weren\u2019t the only ones who had a problem and if we didn\u2019t do it they would have eventually gotten caught. I also told them that whatever happens is their own fault for blatantly breaking the rules.

But there's a reason that the complex has these rules about pool use: liability. \n\nIf a guest's child gets cut with glass, the parents can hold the complex liable. If anyone gets into distress in the pool and there's no lifeguard and a bunch of people are too drunk to help, then the complex can be held liable. Because it's the complex's pool. If this happens, all residents are likely to lose the use of the pool, and rents might have to go up to cover the increase in insurance premiums for the payout(s). If there is insurance and the property doesn't have to be sold to cover a settlement.\n\nThis goes beyond the fact that this is a shared space that other residents wanted to use but couldn't because there were too many non-residents in the pool area. And the big rule of thumb about apartment life is not preventing your neighbors from utilizing their home. The pool is a part of that. And the management ensures that everyone is not unduly burdened by other residents. Don't like that? Don't rent.\n\nHave to rent and don't want to risk losing your lease?

The focus on ethnicity after explaining that \u201cno one really follows the rule\u201d . They even said there isn\u2019t a rule against birthday parties. Even if OP isn\u2019t racist the post sounded like what I\u2019ve seen when people are racist. Because I mean you gotta understand  \u201cthese are Hispanics drinking modelo that had the audacity to have a party for their kid by breaking \u201crules\u201d that everyone breaks and instead of talking to them I need to see a manager. \u201c /s", "There was no reason for her to say the family was Hispanic...

Maybe it makes us over sensitive or maybe it just makes us stand up for ourselves when ppl try to put us down in small ways that are more socially acceptable but still shitty.
