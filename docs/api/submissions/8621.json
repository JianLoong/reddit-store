I think you need to hold out an olive branch to the grandparents for the time being. But for right now, NTA.", "NTA \n\nThey can video chat with her instead. It will help prevent a potential kidnapping.", "NTA\nIf it's escalted to needing a restraining order, keeping her away from the family seems like the best option. If legal, depending on the adoption agreement, and if possible, you and your wife might want to consider moving far away.\n\nQuick eta, adoption agencies and CPS usually prefer to keep children within their biological families. If any of her biological family were fit to adopt her, Emily would be with them instead. Keep that in mind.", "I think you are doing the best you can to protect your daughter and it is perfectly reasonable to make the decision to keep her away from people who might not be in her best interest. She can always make that decision when she is older if she wants to get to know those people later in life.

How long do you think it would be before these family members 'accidently' invite her bio mum to a day they have her. \n\nAs a care kid myself there are good reasons why kids get taken off parents. You are doing the right thing. Although you may have moments of doubt stick to your guns. Your daughter will thank you when she's older.", "Info: have you ever met these people?  It's certainly possible they understand Emily's problems and just want a sensible limited relationship.\n\nYou aren't obligated obviously, but most studies say that kids who know their biofamily, when safe to do so, benefit from it.  Two of my childhood friends adopted from foster care; their kids see bio sibs and some extended family.   It's beneficial for them.  If she would be my kid,, id meet the bio family in a neutral location and sus them out. \n\nNAH, except Emily's biomom", "NTA\n\nThe kid is your kid.

The bio maternal family are strangers. They could be awesome, they could shady and trying to fish for info for Emily's bio mother, or they just might be their own version of terrible. \n\nIt's curious that the family is contacting you all now that Emily had to change schools and you needed a restraining order. In the time span of 6 years or so, they didn't realize the bio mom was pregnant and had a kid. I would talk to a lawyer and/or a social worker (if you have the resources to do so) to protect yourselves legal and figure out what could be possible in the future for contact with Emily and her maternal bio family.", "NTA at all", "NTA\n\nI had a friend who adopted a baby from a similar situation and they had to move several states away to protect themselves from the bio father's family who had originally claimed to just want a relationship.\n\nDon't let societal pressure break you. Protect your child and yourselves!", "NAH but give them a chance. Start with a lawyer if you need to. If you have a restraining order I'm sure you already have one. Let them know that there are zero chances, zero do-overs, if they bring bio mom into her life, they lose access.", "NTA. Your first obligation here is to your daughter. If her bio mom was thinking about her kid and not herself, she would follow whatever guidelines are set forth by the courts and Emily's legal parents. At the age of six, Emily isn't old enough to understand why things are the way they are. You don't need bio mom's family poisoning your child against you. Worse yet, you don't need bio mom kidnapping your child. If bio mom can accept rules and regulations and prove she's not a threat to your daughter, things can gradually change. Until then, I wouldn't let her or her family around Emily either.", "NTA for now cause she's young.  As she gets older reassess as you deem necessary.  Has the family shown manipulative behavior in the past?", "NAH sounds like the situation was the same you were in. You didn't know about it. I would say thought if you decide to allow visitation it should always be when you are around or your wife.", "The timing of these people contacting you right when the restraining order is issued is very suspicious.  \n\nHow did they get your contact info?  Who told them about Emily?\n\nI cannot help but think Bio-mom's fingerprints are all over this because you have removed access to Emily from her.  So she gives her family your contact info so she has access to the child through them.  Shut that down immediately.\n\nI would tell them that due to parental interference, face-to-face access to Emily will not be allowed at this time.  They may send her cards/letters - which you will read first - at this time.  If all goes well, you will allow FaceTime visits so she can see them and learn who they are.  If that goes well, you can look into supervised visits; however that is as far as things will be allowed to go.  Due to the issue between their daughter and your wife, they will not be allowed to have unsupervised access to Emily.  Period.  If they balk at this, then no.  They don't get access to her.  She can decide when she is 18 if she wishes to pursue a relationship.\n\nYou are NTA.  Protect your daughter!", "Yeah, that was my immediate assumption. It could be that the family is genuine people that just want a relationship with the child.

Oops!  Emily's mom was over having coffee!  How did this happen?!?!?!\"\n\nDefinitely meet with the family alone first.", "This is the right answer. You can't blame them for gf's behavior any more than they can blame you for your brothers. They are in the same position that you once were. Likely the exact same position, only you learned of her existence before they did. Seems they're trying to go down the same path you did. Meet with them yourself a couple times, try to see through the lines and do your honest and unbiased best to see them as they are - concerned relatives from the other side of her family.  \n\nWho knows what bro and his gf have said or told them or done to them regarding this child? It could be literally anything. If you shut it down without any options, it will create much more drama down the road. Especially if your child finds out.

She may not have been in communications with her family.   They legitly could have been in the dark.", "This isn't the addict that wants contact.  It's their family.   \n\nMy Bil was an addict.   My husband and their sister are boring  stable people.

Just like leaving her home alone. Some 10 year olds can handle being home alone for an hour while others can't.", "OP is her biological uncle.", "Being \"unfit\" could be as simple as poverty, poor housing or severe medical problems.   Poor/sick people aren't inherently bad to visit.\n\nAlso, op and their spouse are equally biological family, so your point is even weirder", "Does she want a relationship with her bio mom?", "NTA.    There's  your answer \ud83d\ude0a\nMaybe consider it down the road", "Just don't wait too long. The most formative bonding  years for me and my extended family was probably from 6-12.

Even modern princesses.", "Once shes 18 u don't get a say  she will be an adult she won't need your permission", "If the family wanted the child then they should have adopted the child but they didn\u2019t.

Either way, she's 6, she doesn't get to make these decisions yet.", "We told her that. She didn't buy it.", "Definitely not!! She is to young I would only ever consider meeting any other members if the family if I sat down with them first and then only in a public place and I wouldn't allow them any pictures of her that they could share with bio mom", "[deleted]", "Try an alternate approach. If she can't count her diamonds and rubies and crowns and gowns, how will she ever know if a ninja bandit/rival princess/sassy bog witch showed up and raided her stash of pretties?", "I don't know when I'll let her make decisions about her health and safety. It depends on maturity."]}
