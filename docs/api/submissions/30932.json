My daughters are both 2 years old they don't even know what drugs are so I feel like my mother is way out of pocket for the things she said and it pissed me and my wife off so I have not talked to her since Saturday and yesterday which was Sunday she was texting me \"good morning\" and then another random text later in the day like as if nothing had happened the night before.

I\u2019m sure you recognize she\u2019s trying to argue.. you should\u2019ve just stopped her and her tracks, and said something along the lines of \u201c what\u2019s going on mom? I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t call me to argue about states\u201d\n\nThere are just some people in the world that love dancing around their motives in conversation .. I am the kind of person that does not have the bandwidth to deal with it.. your life will be much easier if you learn how to maneuver people so they stop arguing..\n\nAs a parent, it will be a skill you will have to develop, none of us are perfect.. but you\u2019re going to see the signs.. and you get a good start because of your mom", "NTA  Good for you!

Troubling that she doesn't understand that you would, of course, value the well-being of your children above all else, even her.  That's the circle of life.  Her behavior reeks of narcissism.  When you wouldn't play to her ego, she lashed out with the ridiculous drug comment.  If you continue your relationship with your mother, be on high alert for this behavior.  As your daughters get older, she may try this crap with them too.", "NTa\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOF COURSE your kids are morte important. Should be obvious enough to not even need mentioning.", "NTA. Your nuclear family should mean most to you now. If you put your mother above your daughters, there would be something wrong.", "NTA but your mom sounds like pointless drama.

I think it is wild to even love your spouse more than your kids. I don't think that is right. If you choose to have kids, you should love them more or at least equal to your spouse. I don't understand parents who love their spouses more than their kids, it is not fair to the kids. Really a pet peeve of mine."]}
