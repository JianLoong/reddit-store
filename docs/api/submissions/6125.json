I don\u2019t use heat styling anymore because my hair doesn\u2019t like it and makes me pay for it.  If somebody asked me to do it, they would be given a forced lecture on why that\u2019s a no go.  Also, it\u2019s just a ridiculous request for a friend to make.  NTA.  Happy New Year!\n\nCongratulations on embracing your curls.  I finally did three years ago and my hair has never looked or felt better.  When I stopped fighting my hair and instead started listening to what it wanted, we started to really get along and now I\u2019m having mostly good hair days compared to the before times.  It\u2019s a partnership.", "Why?"]}
