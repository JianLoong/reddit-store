Also, it\u2019s just a ridiculous request for a friend to make.  NTA.  Happy New Year!\n\nCongratulations on embracing your curls.  I finally did three years ago and my hair has never looked or felt better.

Your friend should be happy you look nice", "NTA\n\nYour \u201cbest friend\u201d is insecure, but that\u2019s her problem, not yours. She sees you as a threat, and with a characteristic and striking feature such as your hair, she sees you as competition. Until you found a hair routine that worked for you, she likely kept you around because she felt superior to you. You\u2019re coming into yourself and she can\u2019t handle it. If she thinks a guy will ignore her over your hair, she must not have much going for her. \n\nA true best friend wouldn\u2019t expect you to change something about yourself to give her some kind of advantage. Your appearance is yours, just her appearance is hers. She\u2019s put conditions on your friendship: Either you give her what she wants or she\u2019ll ditch you for her backup plan. That\u2019s not a best friend. In fact, she\u2019s not much of a friend at all. \n\nDo not straighten, dye, chop off, or whatever to your hair to appease someone, unless it\u2019s for yourself. Do not change your clothing, makeup or other features about yourself unless you want to. This goes for friends, boyfriends, family, spouses. You make yourself happy for YOU. You surround yourself with people who celebrate you for being you. \n\nTell her no. You\u2019re not changing your hair for her. Remind her no is a full sentence. Tell her despite her resorting to Plan B, you still plan on being at the event.", "NTA", "NTA. She's not a friend.", "Absolutey NTA, and wtf?   Do you also have to wear a turtle neck?  Are you wearing galoshes instead of heals or fancy shoes?  Ask her if she wants you to also wear a football helmet to hide your face?  Your friend is NOT your friend and is totally out of line.  Go to the party as YOURSELF.", "nta - as someone with curly frizz hair and using a chi but to no avail i bot a dyson hair dryer that has the attachments and omg life changing!!  \n\nbut i bet u whether u let your curls be curls or straighten it your beauty shines regardless and your friend is in the dust so go out and have fun and rid that so called friend.", "NTA at all!! I wish I loved my curls, so please rock your curls!", "NTA wear your hair however you like! What an inappropriate thing for her to ask. I suspect it\u2019s not hair that would make men like you more than her.", "NTA\n\nAre you supposed to not have the potential to meet someone also? (Not saying her guy, but any other guy)\n\nYour friend is insecure and if you do this for her, when does it stop?  If she ends up in a relationship are you supposed to straighten your hair every time?   She\u2019ll always be insecure about it", "That was a stupid thing for your friend to ask. Your friend might be stupid.", "... that's not a best friend.  NTA", "She's not your friend, if she thinks that way. You be you.

Also hair masks and detanglers work wonders.", "Haha happy to help :). I was going to say shitty but it didn\u2019t quite cut it.", "Posting this inane obviously nta shit", "NTA. But this is really silly, and your friend is being a bad friend. Do whatever you want with your hair. And maybe resolve to expand your friend group.", "NTA.  Shine and let shine.  Anyone who asks you to be less than you are is not worth spending time with.  If she doesn't make it work with her crush, it's not because you are attractive, it's because she's super insecure.", "NTA. As someone with natural curls, took me a long time to learn to love them. My advice,  fuck your friend and rock your curls!", "Nta. Wear it the way you want. If the guy is that easily distracted, then he's not for either of you anyway", "Nta. Please don't straighten it. I have straight hair and would love to have curls. Wear it curly in honor of a the ones who want to live vicariously through you.

Rock your curls, they are a part of you.\n\nAlso, look into getting friends that treat you better in the new year.", "Your friend is weird.

Your friend is for the bogus request.", "NTA, and your New Year's resolution should include getting rid of the toxic people in your life.", "NTA - it\u2019s not your job to change yourself so she can get a date. It just sounds ridiculous. And she sounds terribly insecure.", "NTA. Keep your hair. I don't know why your friend is causing issues over something petty. It's your hair and she can't do anything about it. All the best.", "Tell your friend to curl her hair. NTA", "NTA.  I have stick-straight hair and would love to have your problem.  Rock in the new year with your wild curls and maybe even a kiss from the hot guy.", "NTA. Is this really your best friend? I wouldn't treat my best friend (or anyone) like that, and I bet you wouldn't either.", "NTA! What is she like?!?? I'd consider long and hard whether she's really a friend.", "Seriously??? I highly doubt it's just your curls men find more attractive about you than her.  Maybe she should have a good look at more than just her outward appearance. \ud83d\ude44\nNTA", "NTA. That's a stupid thing to ask of someone else.", "NTA.  At least she didn't insist you wear a bag over your head.  Ditch a person whose friendship is based on these types of conditions.  And I'm petty as hell, so I'd do everything I could to pick up that guy.", "NTA your friend SUCKS, ditch her and live your curly truth", "As a follow curly haired person, I\u2019m proud of you for embracing it! I didn\u2019t embrace mine until I was well in my 20s. Life is easier now that I don\u2019t have to worry about my hair as much. \n\nAnd your \u201cfriend\u201d sucks and is not your friend. Anyone who goes out of their way to tell you to look different because you might be \u201ctoo attractive\u201d to be seen with them is just a rotten friend. She can try to find someone else. \n\nNTA", "The title alone was WTF! NTA, this person sounds like she only wants to be around you for the wrong reasons and not because she genuinely wants to be your friend. Sometimes curly haired people look as attractive with straight hair too so that friend would of lost already. I suggest getting better mature friends who don\u2019t look at you as competition and more as someone to grow with long term!! Go to that party, don\u2019t acknowledge her and who thinks the same and do you own thing and own your lushes curls", "Nta what a weird thing to ask a friend to do.", "NTA", "NTA. I'd have asked if she would rather I put a paper bag over my head so my hair can't be seen", "NTA \u2014 dump your friend. Friends don\u2019t say shot like that. Her insecurities are her own business and should not affect your decision. Keep it curly and have a blast!!", "Yes!   \n\n\nAnd if there is one thing I want everyone to take into the new year- it's the idea that real friends want you to be happy, they want you to shine.   \n\n\nAnyone who needs you to be less, they aren't your friends.", "I think /u/houdiniwhodunnit should tell her friend to wear this extra curly hair wig because if her supposed best friend is going to act like a clown then she look like one too\n\nhttps://ibb.co/pLN0nrS", "This times a billion!!!!", "NTA! Who ASKS THIS if their \u201cfriend\u201d? I will tell you who DOESNT ASK THIS..a REAL FRIEND!", "NTA and your friend *sucks*.", "NTA. Never dim your light to match a broken one", "Your friend is insecure. Its got nothing to do with your hair. Find some new friends. - NTA", "This is hilarious. She honestly thinks your hair is that hot it has the power to make all the boys want you. All the more reason to rock that hair! \n\nNTA. Get a better friend.", "NTA! I have curly hair and also just understood how to care for it. My friend use to say things to me all the time about it being messy and we don\u2019t talk anymore, just like my friend your friend is not being a supportive person!", "op=NTA\n\nThat's an insane ask.    \nAnd if the guy is going to be attracted to you over your hair, why would she want him?  He's always going to \"prefer\" someone like you.", "NTA", "NTA wow is she insecure, and a terrible friend.  Who on earth thinks someone else's curly hair is going to ruin their chance with some guy?", "People who ask you to downplay your appearance, play dumb or pretend to be ignorant on a topic to make themselves seem better are NOT your friends.\n\nNTA", "NTA\u2026wow", "This comment  \u2b06\ufe0f gets my upvote...and OP is NTA", "Yes! Fellow curly girl here and I was in my early 30s when I learned to love, care for, and embrace my curls!", "Women hyping up other women! We need it.", "Yes! I so agree!\n\nWhen I was in my 20s, my best friend had gorgeous, copper-colored ringlets.
