And the ONLY way to relearn that behavior, which he ABSOLUTELY should do starts with being called on it, which is what you did.\n\nYour reaction was not an overreaction. It was absolutely appropriate to his words, and everyone else there also know it was wrong. That's why they all went quiet.

It's racist and offensive, and you had every right to defend your girlfriend.

This was the late 50s/60s, so your grandfather knew but chose to remain ignorant.  I'm sorry, your family, including auntie, is wrong.

You reacted, then you left.", "YTA, you mean to tell me you had no idea your grandfather is racist?!?!  I find that hard to believe unless he is suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s or Dementia then I can understand that they say off the wall things. I feel like your family knows he\u2019s a racist since your aunt called to yell at you and the rest of your family agrees with them.
