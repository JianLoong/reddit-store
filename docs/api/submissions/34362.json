I share a bathroom with one of my roommates, Eve, and we\u2019re both 25F. Our bathroom also contains the house\u2019s washer and dryer, so even though we\u2019re the only two people using it for bathroom purposes, our other housemates go in and out of it once a week or so. \n\nMy singular, but constant issue with Eve, is that the way she leaves her used tampons/pads in the trash can, it\u2019s very visible to anyone walking into the bathroom. She never folds her pads or wraps her tampons in toilet paper. Eve uses this trash can OFTEN so it gets full pretty quick and it stays full for far too long. She also never \u201csmushes\u201d down the trash, so these bloody products are usually sitting right at the top of the trash bin, if not slightly hanging over. \n\nI started off simply asking Eve to take out the bathroom trash (so I don\u2019t have to risk touching her period products). I would only take it out when it didn\u2019t overflow with bloody pads. But I would still have to look at and smell these products. So eventually I was straightforward and asked her to wrap/cover her used menstrual products in the trash, and that\u2019s when we got into an argument.\n\nEve asked if the guys in the house had a problem with it, and I said that no, it\u2019s me. I told her that they haven\u2019t said anything but I\u2019m sure they don\u2019t love it either. She scoffed and said \u201cso it\u2019s just you that has a problem with it? I don\u2019t see what the issue is then. We\u2019re both women, we both have periods every month. It\u2019s a normal bodily function. What, am I supposed to only throw out my pads in my room?\u201d \nI said that I don\u2019t expect her to stop using our bathroom bin for it\u2019s intended purpose, but that she should wrap/hide her used products like I do. She argued that I only do that because I grew up with all brothers, and that the rest of the modern world isn\u2019t ashamed of their periods.\n\nSince that argument, I\u2019ve been wondering if I am, in fact, behind the times, and that my reaction was uncalled for. That why I think I might be the asshole- because I was raised in a strict and conservative household, while Eve was raised in a loving, relaxed, liberal one. I escaped my family and am trying to break my restrictive upbringing, but at the same time this just seems gross. \nit\u2019s also true that nobody else in the house has voiced this issue except me. Am I justified in being grossed out and complaining about her behavior? Or do I just have a stick up my ass? \n\nTLDR: girl I share a bathroom with leaves her used menstrual products in plain sight. I complained but now I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m just a prude.", "created_utc": 1704426458, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18yx5j7/aita_for_complaining_to_my_roommate_about_her/", "score": 78, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I grew up in a relaxed and loving household, but my mom still taught me to dispose of my menstrual products in a sanitary manner so others do not have to deal with it. Don\u2019t second guess yourself on this one.", "NTA - Bruh I didn\u2019t even read the post the title alone is enough. What the fuck.", "Replace it with a biohazard container. NTA.", "Lowkey high key esh. As someone who grew up being told to wrap my pads up bc I had brothers I get why you think this way but honestly she\u2019s right imo. It\u2019s a normal bodily function and there\u2019s no reason it needs to be hidden away. Overflowing obviously is an issue so I get where you\u2019re coming from there and not wanting to throw it away which is why I think you\u2019re both in the wrong here. Maybe you should get two trash cans and she can get one with a lid which would solve these issues", "NAH. I also don't really fold my pads, wrap tampons in toilet paper or stick them down the trash. We just never did it in my house growing up. Instead, we had a big 'woman bin' with a lid that we tossed all these products in. If you have to sort through the trash, have an open/small bin or have any risk of touching or smelling used pads, I understand that you should pay extra attention to that. I also understand that to her it seems like she has to hide her bodily functions. It probably smells, though.\n\nSo perhaps get an extra bin with a lid for period products?", "These comments puzzle me.... *No comment I've read* tackled the \"issue\" of things not being wrapped, but only talked about her throwing the things *in the trash*.\n\nDear Redditors - where else is she supposed to put it?\n\n*Do not flush sanitary products such as pads and tampons!*", " Even cats cover their poo \ud83e\udd23", "Wait until it\u2019s really full/nasty and take a picture and blow it up and hang it over the washer or something", "NTA.\n\nGet a diaper genie for her menstrual products!", "NTA.

And it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a natural body function. So is shitting. Would she like it if you left the toilet full of shit or wiped your ass and put the tissue all in the open trash like that?", "NTA\n\nMy kids fought a war with each other over this issue. One wraps, one does not. The one who wraps also takes the trash out regularly. They have to share a bathroom as long as they live in my house. They were fighting bitterly over this. It was bad. One day they both went to planned Parenthood and got on continuous birth control so they don't have periods, and the problem was solved.", "FCK it, Take the bin away. If she gets another bin don\u2019t use it and then she can empty it (I know she won\u2019t) but it\u2019s technically not yours to touch! Ask your other room mates to swop bathroom buddies, explain why so they are all aware hopefully they all chat and she then realises nobody wants to use her bathroom and that\u2019s an inconvenience so people will naturally cold shoulder her for being a dirty human to a point she will feel the awkwardness and  move out! Simple simple.", "Vomit is also a \"natural\" excretion. You still flush it.", "NTA, I wouldn\u2019t want to see or smell those damn things", "Get a trash can with a lid???", "NTA. That\u2019s objectively disgusting, from an odor standpoint alone. I (34F) live by myself and I wrap my period trash, as I have for as long as I\u2019ve had a period, because I don\u2019t want to smell my decaying uterine lining every time I step into my bathroom. Like, I\u2019m sorry for being gross, but *this is what we\u2019re talking about*.\n\nFactor in that this is biohazard material, and that she\u2019s not the only person exposed to it? She needs to be serious. This isn\u2019t about period shame, it\u2019s about basic courtesy and cleanliness in a shared space.\n\nI\u2019m going to be 100% honest\u2014 I would absolutely not tolerate this from anyone I shared a bathroom with. If I\u2019m you, i\u2019m telling her that this is not negotiable, the period trash gets wrapped or she can dispose of it only in her room, as she suggested.\n\nHere\u2019s where my advice may turn less helpful, but there are limited options for enforcement and admittedly, I have a petty streak. (I will absolutely expend energy I needn\u2019t to make a point lol.) If it continues, I\u2019m investing in a box of first aid gloves, a roll of dog poo bags, and bleach. Every single time it happens, I\u2019m bagging her trash, leaving it *outside* of her door, and bleaching the garbage can. Best to let it dry in a well ventilated area, may as well be the kitchen. If anyone asks why it\u2019s there, I\u2019m telling them exactly what happened\u2014 starting with the private, polite, highly reasonable request that was shot down.", "I grew up in a house full of women (father died and brother married and moved out).

I'm as feminist as they come and I still think one should be wrapping used period product. They can have a strong smell and they're bodily fluids so should be disposed of cleanly/ in a way that minimises their impacts on the room/people in the room.

I\u2019m a single woman in my late 40s, living by myself, and grew up in a liberal home. I wrap the shit outta my tamps and pads. It\u2019s basic fucking hygiene.

That's just gross.\n\nCould be her upbringing. My stepdaughter had a habit of stripping the pad she last used and just leaving it ON THE FLOOR. Unwrapped, not folded, just a used bloody pad in the middle of the bathroom floor. I had to have multiple conversations with her that it was not okay to leave used period products on the floor; no one wants to see it, it's unsanitary, and the dog would for sure get into it and then that's several whole other messes to clean up...\n\nAbsolutely boggled my mind.", "NTA\n\nYou are simply asking her to cover the products. It's unsanitary to have them hanging out of the bin.", "Don\u2019t worry about it, OP, she\u2019ll be dead from blood loss according to your story.", "NTA - used period products definitely get an unpleasant odour quickly so emptying the bin regularly is just common sense to make it pleasant for everyone. I use a cup now but when I used disposables I would wrap them just to make them easier to handle and minimise mess (and therefore minimise cleaning!)\n\nBut can we please stop referring to period blood as gross and unsanitary! It\u2019s really not. People in the comments likening it to poop need to educate themselves a little!", "Girl NTA at all\n\nIt has nothing to do with being ashamed of periods, it's just simply gross.

Everyone thinks she is disgusting & rude) I def don\u2019t leave them out or super visible & I regularly take out the trash & I also push down the trash to make more compact & would never leave something on top of a n already full garbage meaning someone could risk touching it as they took it out as that is gross but idk I really try to be environmentally conscious & I don\u2019t like having to use a ton of extra toilet paper to wrap them up. I just wrap it into itself if pad. If I\u2019m changing a tampon I usually use the leftover cover from the new tampon I\u2019m putting in & put it in that. I\u2019m also in a state that always has severe drought so I also don\u2019t flush if it\u2019s just pee unless it\u2019s the second or third time someone has used it. Like yes a bathroom may smell a tiny bit, we always have our window open & no one hangs out in there. Like it takes about 5 mins to do laundry. I also take quick showers cuz I\u2019m not trying to use a ton of water. Also toilet paper is very expensive. I openly admit my gross tolerance is higher than most, but I\u2019m surprised no one mentions the environmental factor. It also just really bugged me how OP addressed it like \u201chide\u201d your products. It\u2019d be one thing if she said \u201cI don\u2019t like the possibility of touching your blood while taking it out, that\u2019s a sanitary issue to me & I need you to respect that not giving vibes of women need to hide their results of their natural period.

Guaranteed there are some students using the local laundry instead of this room so their clothes don\u2019t pick up biohazard bacteria. Even basketball games are halted when a player gets cut, everything gets sanitized and wound is covered so exposure doesn\u2019t take place.
