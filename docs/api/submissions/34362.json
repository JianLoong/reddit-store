I share a bathroom with one of my roommates, Eve, and we\u2019re both 25F. Our bathroom also contains the house\u2019s washer and dryer, so even though we\u2019re the only two people using it for bathroom purposes, our other housemates go in and out of it once a week or so. \n\nMy singular, but constant issue with Eve, is that the way she leaves her used tampons/pads in the trash can, it\u2019s very visible to anyone walking into the bathroom. She never folds her pads or wraps her tampons in toilet paper. Eve uses this trash can OFTEN so it gets full pretty quick and it stays full for far too long. She also never \u201csmushes\u201d down the trash, so these bloody products are usually sitting right at the top of the trash bin, if not slightly hanging over. \n\nI started off simply asking Eve to take out the bathroom trash (so I don\u2019t have to risk touching her period products). I would only take it out when it didn\u2019t overflow with bloody pads. But I would still have to look at and smell these products. So eventually I was straightforward and asked her to wrap/cover her used menstrual products in the trash, and that\u2019s when we got into an argument.\n\nEve asked if the guys in the house had a problem with it, and I said that no, it\u2019s me. I told her that they haven\u2019t said anything but I\u2019m sure they don\u2019t love it either. She scoffed and said \u201cso it\u2019s just you that has a problem with it? I don\u2019t see what the issue is then. We\u2019re both women, we both have periods every month. It\u2019s a normal bodily function. What, am I supposed to only throw out my pads in my room?\u201d \nI said that I don\u2019t expect her to stop using our bathroom bin for it\u2019s intended purpose, but that she should wrap/hide her used products like I do. She argued that I only do that because I grew up with all brothers, and that the rest of the modern world isn\u2019t ashamed of their periods.\n\nSince that argument, I\u2019ve been wondering if I am, in fact, behind the times, and that my reaction was uncalled for. That why I think I might be the asshole- because I was raised in a strict and conservative household, while Eve was raised in a loving, relaxed, liberal one. I escaped my family and am trying to break my restrictive upbringing, but at the same time this just seems gross. \nit\u2019s also true that nobody else in the house has voiced this issue except me. Am I justified in being grossed out and complaining about her behavior? Or do I just have a stick up my ass? \n\nTLDR: girl I share a bathroom with leaves her used menstrual products in plain sight. I complained but now I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m just a prude.", "created_utc": 1704426458, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18yx5j7/aita_for_complaining_to_my_roommate_about_her/", "score": 51, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
