She developed some issues due to being intubated and just the trauma of her birth, including needing to have a G-Tube and having an oral aversion.

My husband and I both work full time, him in the office, me hybrid (Tu/Wed/Thurs WFH and Mon/Fri Office). So yesterday my husband picks up baby from his parent's and his mom mentions having some family friends coming over tomorrow (today) to hang out with baby. Well I've been trying to have these same friends over for over a month and they've been unresponsive to my planning attempts. So when my husband tells me they're going over to his mom's, it just hurts a lot. I'm always the one reaching out for most of my friendships to plan things and if I don't, I just don't hear from anyone. I'll admit it's an insecurity of mine and I feel like maybe people just don't like me, though I try to give the benefit of the doubt since people are busy living lives and having obligations like we are. \n\nSo I say, baby will be staying home with me tomorrow while I'm WFH. Husband is a bit upset because now he has to call his mom to tell her that baby won't be coming over, and I feel bad for ruining her plans but at the same time, I just want to be there when people are meeting her and holding her and talking with her. MIL and I have a cordial relationship and I am so grateful we have his parents to help us with childcare but there have been other incidents where I've felt MIL has overstepped, including a time she took baby out of my arms at a family party and another time she wanted to feed baby in a not ideal location (busy room vs me wanting a quiet secluded room since baby still has a lot of oral issues and needs to focus on eating but is distracted easily). Husband stands by me and calls his mom this morning just saying baby isn't feeling well but I'm still feeling conflicted about it all because I feel like the asshole but also, isn't it okay to want to be there when people are meeting/hanging out with our baby?\n\nSo AITA for keeping baby home and ruining MIL's plans?", "created_utc": 1680007975, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/124nttv/aita_for_keeping_my_7mo_baby_home_when_i_learn_my/", "score": 149, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is one of those trade offs for having family as daycare.  \n\nBut with these particular guests I can understand your frustration because you have been trying to get together with them.

My MIL watched my kid every Friday until she started school at age 6, so I have experienced this exact situation. Family members that don't even send us Christmas cards would make plans to meet my kid with my MIL. She arranged playdates with my daughters friends without telling us. Those are just some examples I can think of off the top of my head, but it was all the time with the boundary stepping. And there wasnt anything i could do because I needed her to watch my kid. At the beginning I couldnt afford the extra day at daycare, but when i could afford it I was afraid to cross that bridge with MIL so I sucked it up the last year.

She is bound to be just as excited about showing off baby as you are. It really isn\u2019t her fault that people accepted her invitation and not yours. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to be an AH to you. I\u2019m socially awkward and have social anxiety. I would be just as uncomfortable if I was in this situation, but I have the benefit of looking at it from the outside. \n\nI can understand wanting to set boundaries with your MIL. I never had problems with my MIL when it came to my kids. But I sure had problems when it came to my own mother and I wish I would have been better at setting boundaries. She used the fact that she provided childcare as an excuse to do whatever the hell she pleased. And honestly, paying for childcare would have been a lot easier. Just some advice though, pick your battles. Feeding the baby in a crowded room? Oh the shame! /s A lot of other issues are bound to come up in your relationship. So there is a line you want to find between setting these boundaries early so that she learns to not overstep and causing unnecessary strife which could eventually rub off on your marriage.\n\nEdit: I went through and read some more of the comments so just came back to restate that you are certainly the AH. Do you and your MIL have a relationship where you need a formal invitation? You write in a comment that the \u2018idea\u2019 would be that the guests would be there when you dropped baby off so y\u2019all would all meet up but then in another comment you said it hurt because you were not \u2018invited\u2019. I think your only issue with this whole situation is that you tried to invite and they did a semi-shady \u2018oh maybe\u2019 or just didn\u2019t respond but then when MIL asked they responded right away. But they are your MIL friends! You are kind of acting like she stole your high school bosom buddy! \n\nI\u2019m sending you a virtual hug. Again, I know this stings. I know it is painful.

What's interesting is these family friends have been LC or NC with your invitation; yet MIL has planned this whole day with the same group, but baby's mother is not invited.

I just feel bad now that I've punished my MIL for my feelings.", "Just because they aren't her friends doesn't mean they're assholes. Not everybody has to like/want to hang out with everybody else. OP even said they were her husband/Mil's family friends. It sounds like maybe they just don't click with OP.", "I think so.

I feel like because people don't know that I wasn't even allowed to hold my baby girl for the first week of her life, couldn't touch her got the first 3 days, and yes, it's a drop in the bucket compared to the rest of the time I'll have with her, I think it still changed how important these moments are to me.", "My invitation was open ended up whenever they had a free hour or two to spare. I'm not sure what MIL's scheduling plans was like tbh. I only learned about the plan through my husband.", "Thank you and I agree.

She's well established in this area, she's never lived anywhere else and all my husband's family is here so I could see her absolutely bringing baby girl places without telling us. \n\nIf you don't mind me asking, what do you think you'd have done differently?

She's retired so she has flexible time for plans.", "So why should they have access to get child?", "Are they your friends or are they her friends? I\u2019m confused bc generally speaking MILs and DILs don\u2019t have the same social group.", "Do you have mommy and me classes or baby enrichment classes in your area? I feel like you need an outlet for adult social interaction that isn\u2019t linked to your in-laws. The moms in those groups are in your situation, so it\u2019s something you can bond over and build your own social network.", "Try speaking to your MIL and your husband. Try telling them how hurt you are over this. Just try to be transparent.\n\nI'm not exactly sure of the relationship that your friends and MIL have but Try speaking to your husband first and clear the misunderstanding.", "It's really tough, and I won't pretend to have all the answers. My instinct is to say if I could do it all over I wouldn't have taken the free child care, but most of the time it was happening I just wanted to let my daughter have a good relationship with her grandparents. I could have ended the situation this last year, but my daughter would have been devastated. \n\nI've been really encouraging my husband to have the awkward conversations with his side of the family. I had the awkward talks with my side of the family so its hus turn lol. I do think he made a mistake by not being direct about our concerns from the beginning. We did try to address issues we had with her and she kind of flipped out and refused to discuss, so there are a lot of dynamics that are difficult to get in to.\n\nI've typed out a lot of words all to say that my advice is to be direct about how you're feeling now so that it doesn't get any worse.", "No, OP said \u201cI want to be there when people are meeting her and holding her and talking to her.\u201d This is about OP\u2019s feelings about her relationship with her \u201cfriends,\u201d not about the baby\u2019s safety otherwise it would be \u201cI want to keep the baby home because these are a lot of new introductions that could make my baby sick.\u201d", "That's all well and good, but she needs to find some adults who actually want to hang out with her. It's clear these friends don't. And if she was going to be fine exposing the baby to them in order to get that company then she can't really pretend that the issue is the exposure", "[deleted]", "I wish I could and I wish she would do what you do! That would be AMAZING! She barely knows how to text though and I don't think she's ever worked a call phone camera. Having her do that sort of thing would be a huge weight off my shoulders though. She's just not that good at communicating. My husband has gone MONTHS without talking with his parents before (when he lived out of state) for the simple reason that they just aren't big communicators. They're the \"no news is good news\" type people where if you aren't talking with them, then they're doing good. I talk to my mom almost every day so I don't really understand how they do that, but that's his relationship with his parents. Idk.", "Per OP, these are the MIL\u2019s friends from church.", "They are friends of her husband's family. They aren't OP friends.", "More importantly you need to find some counselling for yourself.  You've been through some trauma with your birth and post birth experience and need to find a professional who can help you process those feelings.", "Wait, you tell her you\u2019ve been trying to get these people together, they don\u2019t have time for you, mil sets it up without you being there and you don\u2019t think she\u2019s being malicious? It is the definition of malicious and she owes you an apology and you owe her nothing.", "Are you uncomfortable with these friends being around your baby or are you bitter that they don't want to hang out with you? If it's the former then you're absolutely NTA. If you're trying to ruin your MILs plans because these friends don't like you as much then you're absolutely TA.", "You were petty, maybe that is the reason they don't want to hang out with you.", "Yet you lied about the baby being sick so you could prevent her friends from seeing the baby out of petty jealousy?  Soft YTA", "Sorry what I meant is, if I was excluded from a family get together, that intends to introduce my child, why would I allow access to my child. It can seem petty, but so is exclusion. I would not allow my child into a situation that I felt disrespected. However, OP could ask to be included in a future event in which she could introduce their child.", "Thank you, that's probably why I have no friends \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Thank you for your judgement and your concern! I've been working with a therapist since a few weeks after my baby was born because I was worried about PTSD and PPD. She doesn't seem to think there's much concern, which in an overreaching theme, I do agree with but there's these little things that happen that effect us but never happen close enough to when I meet with her for me to process it safely without having to react, if that makes sense. She's a postpartum therapist so maybe I need a therapist that works more on normal every day things like jealousy.", "It's the second one, 100%. They are all very kind people and I think I just thought we were closer and they'd be more interested in meeting her, and catching up with us, than they actually were. I'll have to try to make it up to MIL some how, I know she was excited about today so I feel really awful for letting my jealousy get in the way of that.", "Actually that was op husband. Op decided to have the baby stay home and he chose to lie to his mom .", "Who exactly are these people? Are they MIL's friends, your friends, or people you're both friends with independently?", "They're family friends on my husband's side. Not my friends per say but people my husband has know basically since he was born. They go to the same church as MIL/FIL (which is how they met I believe) and have known each other for a long time. It's a family of 4, the father and mother that's around the same age as MIL/FIL, a daughter whose a few years younger than us, and a son that my husband was a groomsmen in his wedding.  We've recently, in the past few years, moved back to his home city. So we've been reconnecting with them and I thought we were closer than I think we actually are. I hope this clarifies things!"]}
