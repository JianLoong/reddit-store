She developed some issues due to being intubated and just the trauma of her birth, including needing to have a G-Tube and having an oral aversion. So I'm pretty protective of her, as a first time mom and having to deal with the trauma myself.\n\nAnyways, my MIL watches baby Mondays and Tuesdays. My husband and I both work full time, him in the office, me hybrid (Tu/Wed/Thurs WFH and Mon/Fri Office). So yesterday my husband picks up baby from his parent's and his mom mentions having some family friends coming over tomorrow (today) to hang out with baby. Well I've been trying to have these same friends over for over a month and they've been unresponsive to my planning attempts. So when my husband tells me they're going over to his mom's, it just hurts a lot. I'm always the one reaching out for most of my friendships to plan things and if I don't, I just don't hear from anyone. I'll admit it's an insecurity of mine and I feel like maybe people just don't like me, though I try to give the benefit of the doubt since people are busy living lives and having obligations like we are. \n\nSo I say, baby will be staying home with me tomorrow while I'm WFH. Husband is a bit upset because now he has to call his mom to tell her that baby won't be coming over, and I feel bad for ruining her plans but at the same time, I just want to be there when people are meeting her and holding her and talking with her. MIL and I have a cordial relationship and I am so grateful we have his parents to help us with childcare but there have been other incidents where I've felt MIL has overstepped, including a time she took baby out of my arms at a family party and another time she wanted to feed baby in a not ideal location (busy room vs me wanting a quiet secluded room since baby still has a lot of oral issues and needs to focus on eating but is distracted easily). Husband stands by me and calls his mom this morning just saying baby isn't feeling well but I'm still feeling conflicted about it all because I feel like the asshole but also, isn't it okay to want to be there when people are meeting/hanging out with our baby?\n\nSo AITA for keeping baby home and ruining MIL's plans?", "created_utc": 1680007975, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/124nttv/aita_for_keeping_my_7mo_baby_home_when_i_learn_my/", "score": 505, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is one of those trade offs for having family as daycare.  \n\nBut with these particular guests I can understand your frustration because you have been trying to get together with them.

My MIL watched my kid every Friday until she started school at age 6, so I have experienced this exact situation. Family members that don't even send us Christmas cards would make plans to meet my kid with my MIL. She arranged playdates with my daughters friends without telling us. Those are just some examples I can think of off the top of my head, but it was all the time with the boundary stepping. And there wasnt anything i could do because I needed her to watch my kid. At the beginning I couldnt afford the extra day at daycare, but when i could afford it I was afraid to cross that bridge with MIL so I sucked it up the last year.

I\u2019m socially awkward and have social anxiety. I would be just as uncomfortable if I was in this situation, but I have the benefit of looking at it from the outside. \n\nI can understand wanting to set boundaries with your MIL. I never had problems with my MIL when it came to my kids. But I sure had problems when it came to my own mother and I wish I would have been better at setting boundaries. She used the fact that she provided childcare as an excuse to do whatever the hell she pleased. And honestly, paying for childcare would have been a lot easier. Just some advice though, pick your battles. Feeding the baby in a crowded room? Oh the shame! /s A lot of other issues are bound to come up in your relationship. So there is a line you want to find between setting these boundaries early so that she learns to not overstep and causing unnecessary strife which could eventually rub off on your marriage.\n\nEdit: I went through and read some more of the comments so just came back to restate that you are certainly the AH. Do you and your MIL have a relationship where you need a formal invitation? You write in a comment that the \u2018idea\u2019 would be that the guests would be there when you dropped baby off so y\u2019all would all meet up but then in another comment you said it hurt because you were not \u2018invited\u2019. I think your only issue with this whole situation is that you tried to invite and they did a semi-shady \u2018oh maybe\u2019 or just didn\u2019t respond but then when MIL asked they responded right away.

What's interesting is these family friends have been LC or NC with your invitation; yet MIL has planned this whole day with the same group, but baby's mother is not invited.

It's your job as a parent to filter out unwanted people from contact with your baby.\n\nYou need to articulate this to your MIL. These \"friends\" snubbed you. They made it clear they do not want to maintain a relationship with you. Your MIL needs to not facilitate these people side stepping you to see your baby. Honestly, it does sound like your MIL decided to sidestep you too. You're not jealous, and don't let anyone characterize it as such. You're drawing boundaries.\n\nNTA", "NTA.

So I thought we were close but they're also my MILs friends as they've gone to the same church for my husband's whole life.

I understand what you're saying though, it's not fair to put the burden on him when it was my choice.", "Thank you for your response! I'm glad someone else can relate to the feeling of seeing people coo over your baby lol it's such an amazing feeling and it just makes me feel sad that MIL didn't recognize that when I had talked with her about them meeting her initially. I think I may be willing to try talking with MIL about it, though maybe in a week or so. I just have to figure out how to put into words what I'm feeling. Some others have recommended mommy and me classes so I think I'm going to look into those more.", "From the comments, they are the MIL's friends from church, and MIL hangs out with one of the often.

This is her 4th grandchild though we are the physically closest (5 minutes away vs 3 states away). \n\nAnd perhaps I didn't explain the feeding situation very well but baby didn't eat at the beginning. She needed a G-Tube, a medical device that literally pumps food straight into her stomach. We and she, had to start learning how to get her to eat at around 1 month of age with a speech therapist once a week. She would only take one type of bottle, at one specific temperature, stuff like that. She had reflux as well. So eating is very important to us. She still doesn't eat the amounts that the pediatrician recommends she be at and now that we're trying solids, it's back to speech therapy because she freaks out whenever anything gets past her front teeth. So when I had recommended we feed her in a quiet room vs in front of a party of 20, it was because she wouldn't eat otherwise and she's already below weight and has the other factors working against her. I was just trying to look out for her best interest and what she needed to be fed.\n\nBut I agree with everything else you've said and thank you. I do have to choose my battles and I don't want this effective my marriage at all.

Did you say that you wanted to spend time with them or that you were excited for them to meet your daughter?", "I just wanna add (especially bc some of these comments are nasty) to not be too hard on yourself. You\u2019ve gone through a lot and no one understands how traumatic a difficult birth, NICU stay, *and* a medically complex baby can really be. On top of that you\u2019ve recently moved, which is a huge change in and of itself. \nYou\u2019re absolutely entitled to your feelings and to be gentle with yourself as you process them. It sounds like your husband has your back which is awesome. This is all new territory for you and your whole family and you\u2019re allowed to take your time while learning to navigate it (and that includes telling white lies to give yourself some emotional space). Also no one is entitled to access to your child.

OP has acquaintances but wants more of a relationship. These people are family friends of her husband's family, however, and it's completely reasonable for them to want to meet the baby.", "especially since her health is still pretty fragile as OP mentioned. I'm childfree but I would never insist on meeting a baby with a whole other bunch of people where I knew the child had sensitive health issues. given that she's only 7 months, she's definitely not fully vaccinated either, so preventing her from getting sick as much as possible (especially now that it's springtime in the northern hemisphere and illnesses are spreading like crazy). so that added on top of them clearly not caring about OP just makes the most sense to me.\n\nBTW op, you are NTA", "That's a good recommendation! I'll have to look into it more, I know I had looked before baby was born and most classes were too expensive but maybe there's something available that we can afford. I do think I need some outlet, I don't have many people that aren't my husband's family in the area so it's hard feeling a bit isolated.", "I feel the same way. I want baby girl to have a good relationship with her grandparents, especially because mine are across the country but I also wish they would communicate more with us about what's going on. I try to have the same divide with him dealing with his family and I with mine but he has such a different relationship with his parents that I don't think he's ever talked about his feelings on anything with them so I'm not sure how I'm supposed to open up to them. It's very hard and ends with me feeling ignored or like they're overstepping when they just didn't even think to ask us. Thank you for sharing your insight though, I'm looking forward to daycare or school so that this tension can be removed.", "Hahaha that would have been awesome to do but we drop baby girl off at MILs at 6am and I doubt the friends would have been there that early.

Other than that you want to be there\n\nIsn't it possible the people are coming on a day that is convenient for them?

It\u2019s common sense that the mother should be asked permission for things like this, especially with such a young baby, and not only that but they should be included in events like these.

I thought we had clicked really well and had a lot in common. They are younger than us by a few years. The mother is around MILs age and a kind person but tbh it was mostly the daughter who I was reaching out to and said it would be nice for her parents to come visit too as they've known my husband his whole life and they're really kind, wonderful people.

She knows I have a pretty flexible work schedule and she knew I wanted to see them meet baby girl, so I'm not sure why there was no invitation for me to join. But when we talk with them next, I'll bring up that I'm available to be around as I love seeing people meet and interact with baby girl and I WANT to be there!", "A lot of people have recommended the mommy and me groups! I had kind of given up because the ones I looked into were all so expensive (mommy and me yoga and such). I've moved probably once every 2-3 years which would explain a bit why I seem to find it hard to build and keep connections. They just fade out over time and it sucks! I don't click with anyone at my new job either, they're all older men in their 50s+ with grown children, I just can't relate to them and they don't care about the things I'm going through. Thank you so much for your kind response though, I really appreciate it. I know our library is really active so I'm hopeful I'll find something.", "Thank you! These are some really great suggestions. I appreciate your kindness!", "Right, because AFTER telling mil want you have been trying to do and she does it,  that is the damn definition of malicious. Sad op doesn\u2019t see that", "You might want to join some mom groups and make friends there - if the daughter ghost you then there isn't much there other then her helping her mother friends dil out - Honestly your baby probably shouldn't be around more people then require until she gets all of her shots", "Yes well they can do just that, it's not like MIL isn't gonna be there. No need to involve the baby.", "Where does OP say that?", "Good luck \ud83e\udd70", "Local libraries are definitely a good resource! Not only will they have good kid friendly events for you to attend but you may even be able to get more resource suggestions from the librarians there for other things going on in your community/ ways to connect with other moms.\n\nIt may also be worth it to check Facebook for local mommy groups too, instead of just looking at ones that are tied to paid classes or events. In my area with just a quick search I was able to find a good handful of groups that are just for local moms to share, vent, get advice, and plan meet-ups/events at kid friendly spaces. Granted I do live in a very populous area so whether those groups/how many of those groups exist for you may depend on the size of the community where you live but I'm sure you'll be able to find something helpful.", "The original person I replied to was insinuating that OP\u2019s concern was based on the baby\u2019s health,  when it\u2019s not.", "\"But OP is trying to say the safety of the baby is the issue.\"", "They\u2019ve got an entire paragraph on it in their post when it\u2019s not relevant."]}
