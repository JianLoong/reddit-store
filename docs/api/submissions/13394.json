It wasn't easy, she was in the NICU for over a month and almost died during child birth. She developed some issues due to being intubated and just the trauma of her birth, including needing to have a G-Tube and having an oral aversion. So I'm pretty protective of her, as a first time mom and having to deal with the trauma myself.\n\nAnyways, my MIL watches baby Mondays and Tuesdays. My husband and I both work full time, him in the office, me hybrid (Tu/Wed/Thurs WFH and Mon/Fri Office). So yesterday my husband picks up baby from his parent's and his mom mentions having some family friends coming over tomorrow (today) to hang out with baby. Well I've been trying to have these same friends over for over a month and they've been unresponsive to my planning attempts. So when my husband tells me they're going over to his mom's, it just hurts a lot. I'm always the one reaching out for most of my friendships to plan things and if I don't, I just don't hear from anyone. I'll admit it's an insecurity of mine and I feel like maybe people just don't like me, though I try to give the benefit of the doubt since people are busy living lives and having obligations like we are. \n\nSo I say, baby will be staying home with me tomorrow while I'm WFH. Husband is a bit upset because now he has to call his mom to tell her that baby won't be coming over, and I feel bad for ruining her plans but at the same time, I just want to be there when people are meeting her and holding her and talking with her. MIL and I have a cordial relationship and I am so grateful we have his parents to help us with childcare but there have been other incidents where I've felt MIL has overstepped, including a time she took baby out of my arms at a family party and another time she wanted to feed baby in a not ideal location (busy room vs me wanting a quiet secluded room since baby still has a lot of oral issues and needs to focus on eating but is distracted easily). Husband stands by me and calls his mom this morning just saying baby isn't feeling well but I'm still feeling conflicted about it all because I feel like the asshole but also, isn't it okay to want to be there when people are meeting/hanging out with our baby?\n\nSo AITA for keeping baby home and ruining MIL's plans?", "created_utc": 1680007975, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/124nttv/aita_for_keeping_my_7mo_baby_home_when_i_learn_my/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Do you share the same group of friends as your MIL?", "NAH\n\nIt doesn't sound like mil was trying to go behind your back and introduce baby to people without you there...if she was she wouldn't have mentioned the plans.  \n\nI think you are being a little over sensitive  especially since mil has the baby every week, you can't really expect to be around for every introduction mil does have a life, but it would be appropriate to ask mil to run guests by you first especially if baby is a little fragile with her health.  \n\nAlso if mil has the baby this much, she will most likely feel more like a third parent (to herself and baby), then a regular grandma.  It is one of those trade offs for having family as daycare.  \n\nBut with these particular guests I can understand your frustration because you have been trying to get together with them.  It is possible their schedule just happens to be open at the time mil asked and they are not trying to avoid you.", "its your child do whatever you wanna do", "NTA. She's your child, not your MiLs. It doesn't matter if she's helping out or not. She does not get to plan events with your child without your consent.\n\nNo matter how helpful she may be, she is crossing a reasonable boundary here, and that's not acceptable. Especially when considering your childs difficult start to life. Being extremely cautious about too many people around your little one is perfectly normal given the circumstances.\n\nIt's a bit odd that these people won't respond to you but will seemingly jump at the chance to see your child when MiL has her. But no, you're not an AH for putting your foot down and saying no, you're not comfortable with that many people being around your child without being there yourself.\n\nIf MiL gets upset to the point she won't help look after the child because of this, I'd treat it as proof that she wasn't helping for the right reasons.", "NTA it won\u2019t hurt anybody to keep the baby home one day. But I would be concerned if you start making this a pattern.  It\u2019s not your MIL\u2019s fault if people gravitate towards her and while I understand not making an effort for \u201cfriends\u201d to see your kid if they aren\u2019t nice to the parents, I wouldn\u2019t reduce grandparent time to avoid those third parties short of a safety issue or significant falling out such that people know your kids aren\u2019t allowed to be around those \u201cfriends\u201d. \n\nNote: I tend to feel as you do about rejection. It definitely hurts but as much as it sucks, keep trying with other people as much as you can. You don\u2019t need a huge collection of friends, but a few that maybe don\u2019t have family connections will help make you feel more secure. I value those connections a lot because unlike family connections, there is no reason in the world why someone I met while volunteering has to keep in touch with me so if they do, surely it\u2019s because they want to.", "NTA My son was in NICU for 2 weeks. Bluntly put, NICU is a picture of hell.  It's brutal for all involved. I would have the same feelings as you do, especially if my MIL took my baby or if my arms.

Give yourself time to adjust to the horrible trauma.", "Info \u2014 Why didn\u2019t you just talk to your MIL & ask if she could reschedule for a day that you could be there with the baby to visit with these friends?\n\nETA \u2014 sorry but YTA in this one. Seems like you already know that. You\u2019re trying to excuse your behavior by using concern for your baby\u2019s birth trauma & throwing in a couple of instances where your MIL apparently overstepped when the fact is your hurt by people not visiting you. Just be honest with your MIL & ask her what\u2019s going on with these friends. You\u2019re punishing your MIL & she did nothing wrong. She\u2019s the person helping & supporting your family right now. You got your feelings hurt & decided to hurt your MIL.", "Soft YTA.\n\nBy the sounds of it, you're not allowing it more because you yourself have an issue with these friends and your insecurity surrounding the whole 'being ignored'. And not because you have a genuine concern about your child's safety being around them.\n\nYou should probably address this problem with your friends and sort it out.", "YTA. This has nothing to do with birth trauma and everything to do with you being petty and jealous of other people\u2019s relationships.", "YTA\n\nYou're punishing your MIL because people who didn't want to hang out with you...wouldn't hang out with you. And then having Husband call MIL and blatantly lie to her that the baby isn't feeling well.\n\nIf this was an emergency or something it would be different, but you're doing this song and dance purely for petty reasons.", "NTA!!\nYOUR baby, your choice!", "Info if you do this and MIL says, 'fine, I'm not babysitting anymore' are you prepared to handle that?", "YTA. \n\nYour reason for changing the arrangements are in your words \u201cto ruin her plans\u201d? How could you not be an asshole here? You have a good relationship with your MIL, why punish her? I get that you are jealous that these people have rebuffed you, but you simply can\u2019t punish people for spending time w people who do not want spend time w you. ??\n\nAlso, I\u2019m confused by the dynamic where you and MIL share a friend group? These people haven\u2019t made the effort to see you for reasons we don\u2019t know. I hate to kick you when you\u2019re down bc I can imagine how it hurts to feel rejected, but: that you would be punitive and petty in this way\u2026that\u2019s not a quality I accept in my friends, intentionally hurting someone who you depend on to generously help you with your child? No, ma\u2019am. \n\nAlso\u2026your other grievances w MIL stood out to me as well. Again, we don\u2019t have the full context, but taking baby from your arms and feeding baby in a location less quiet than you prefer - doesn\u2019t sound malicious. Also sounds like simple things to ask her to politely not do.", "YTA\n\nOP you are being petty.\n\nYou're acting as if MIL asked those friends to complete ignore your invites and come to hers instead. Your insecurity is gonna get in the way of the cordial relationship you have with MIL as well as your husband.", "YTA for retaliating against your MIL for an issue between you and other people.", "Soft YTA.

I talked with her last week about wanting to get these specific friends together so they can meet our baby and how excited I was for them to meet her so I think she knows that I was wanting this but how am I supposed to open up to someone that is a pretty emotionless person to even her own kids?

I honestly wish she would just communicate with us more about what she wants to do with our baby, his family is very much \"no news is good news\" people and they don't do casual communication.", "Hi! Thank you for the response. I didn't ask her to reschedule because I wasn't there when my husband picked up baby and I don't feel like I'm close enough to her to call her up and ask her to do that.

I'm not sure why she hasn't responded to set up a meeting either, she's probably just busy. I agree I'm acting awfully over my own issues but I just don't feel comfortable talking with my MIL about these sorts of things. She's not a feelings person, she's nice enough but I definitely can't open up to her and be vulnerable. Her own kids can't even do that so I don't know how I could unfortunately. They're very sink or swim people, no news is good news, we do our own thing people.

I don't think she's done it maliciously at all, which is why I feel awful having these feelings. I think she had just planned to see her friend and already had baby and wanted to make an event of it, which is why it hurts not being included. I think I am the asshole, I'll have to figure out a way to make it up to her.", "Well I guess the implication was that we'd be there when they met her as well.

I'm appreciative of all MIL does for us and I'm happy she loves baby so much.", "[deleted]", "Yeah last week we had talked about it though she could have forgotten. She sees the \"mom\", her friend, probably a few times a week or at least once a week during their church time so I understand it was probably just a spur of the moment plan for them.", "Thank you. This is a really kind response. I'm really looking forward to meeting new people, it's been hard being back in a place I haven't lived in for 10+ years and reaching out to people that have busy lives too. It just makes me feel pretty alone. I'm a social person so having not a lot of friends around is hard. My MIL really is a kind person most of the time and I think she does mean well.
