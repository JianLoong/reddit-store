In high school, she helped me assemble a last-minute costume as a \"moth fairy.\" We thought it was HILARIOUS. Later, she made an elaborate drawing of a moth fairy for me. We both loved it. But she wanted to hold onto it because it reminded her of me. She told me, \"I want to keep it for now. You can have it after I die.\"\n\nIt represented the good times. But even when the Alzheimer's hit in full force, I followed her wishes. Her artwork stayed with her.\n\nI didn't anticipate a family member taking it. \n\nWhen mom no longer knew the date/year/season or her own age, and couldn't make food or read bills, she moved to my aunt's house so I could work on clearing out her house and selling it to get her into memory care.\n\nSo her art was at my aunt's house. Then mom's brother and his wife (52f) came to visit. The wife saw the moth fairy drawing, the most beautiful/detailed piece, and asked to keep it. And mom, not remembering the significance, said \"Okay.\" Mind you, this was a woman with moderate dementia who didn't know her own middle name.\n\nI was devastated when I found out. But I assumed once the wife knew the significance, she would surely return the drawing.

She did not respond.\n\nWhen I saw the wife, she refused to make eye contact or acknowledge me. When I gently inquired about the drawing, she immediately got angry saying my request was selfish -- no, that I was selfish. That she and my mom had a \"deep and meaningful conversation\" and the artwork represented that. (Please keep in mind the advanced dementia my mom had at the time this supposed conversation would have taken place.) \n\nShe said I was rude to even ask. She said that they'd come to town to visit family, not me. She lectured me about how \"you can't always get what you want in life.\" \n\nI've experienced people angry at me before, but never like this. There was such spite in her words. It felt like we'd been feuding for years, but we'd really only ever exchanged idle pleasantries. I realized I'd never see the drawing again. \n\nFor my part, I did say that the drawing wasn't hers to take. That it was something very meaningful to me. The one potentially rude comment I did make was, \"I hope that every time you look at it, you remember that you took away something that meant a lot to me.\"\n\nIf mom had been in her right mind, she'd never have given it away.

NTA for this instance, legally this is probably theft. Even if the other party may argue it was willingly given, that argument loses credence when your mother may not have had the mental faculties to coherently consent to giving the drawing. Your uncle may argue this as a lawyer, but you were the one with POA if I am reading right, so I think the law will side with you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Making sure her ID is still valid. Making sure she has everything she needs -- toiletries, her favorite snacks, etc. She loses her comb? I need to get a new comb. Being the point of contact whenever the facility has a problem. She's had some recurrent minor health problems that crop up without warning that cause the memory care to send her to the ER unnecessarily -- usually in the middle of the night, and I have to handle that. The family blames me when she doesn't answer her phone, but she doesn't know how it works anymore. Her sister goes to visit her (which she only does rarely) and she's unshowered? I get an angry call, even though I know that sometimes she fights taking a shower and the memory care staff have to pick their battles. I have her cat, a sweet lump of a creature, who it turned out had eye cancer, so I took her to a specialist to have the eye removed two weeks ago.
