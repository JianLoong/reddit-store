If you're familiar with Alz, she's in stage 6 now. I've always loved her art. There was one piece in particular that was special. In high school, she helped me assemble a last-minute costume as a \"moth fairy.\" We thought it was HILARIOUS. Later, she made an elaborate drawing of a moth fairy for me. We both loved it. But she wanted to hold onto it because it reminded her of me. She told me, \"I want to keep it for now. You can have it after I die.\"\n\nIt represented the good times. But even when the Alzheimer's hit in full force, I followed her wishes. Her artwork stayed with her.\n\nI didn't anticipate a family member taking it. \n\nWhen mom no longer knew the date/year/season or her own age, and couldn't make food or read bills, she moved to my aunt's house so I could work on clearing out her house and selling it to get her into memory care.\n\nSo her art was at my aunt's house. Then mom's brother and his wife (52f) came to visit. The wife saw the moth fairy drawing, the most beautiful/detailed piece, and asked to keep it. And mom, not remembering the significance, said \"Okay.\" Mind you, this was a woman with moderate dementia who didn't know her own middle name.\n\nI was devastated when I found out. But I assumed once the wife knew the significance, she would surely return the drawing. (Though she should've consulted me as the only child AND Power of Attorney before taking anything.)\n\nRecently, mom's brother and his wife were visiting again, so I messaged the wife explaining the significance of this piece, and politely asked if they could bring it back. She did not respond.\n\nWhen I saw the wife, she refused to make eye contact or acknowledge me. When I gently inquired about the drawing, she immediately got angry saying my request was selfish -- no, that I was selfish. That she and my mom had a \"deep and meaningful conversation\" and the artwork represented that. (Please keep in mind the advanced dementia my mom had at the time this supposed conversation would have taken place.) \n\nShe said I was rude to even ask. She said that they'd come to town to visit family, not me. She lectured me about how \"you can't always get what you want in life.\" \n\nI've experienced people angry at me before, but never like this. There was such spite in her words. It felt like we'd been feuding for years, but we'd really only ever exchanged idle pleasantries. I realized I'd never see the drawing again. \n\nFor my part, I did say that the drawing wasn't hers to take. That it was something very meaningful to me. The one potentially rude comment I did make was, \"I hope that every time you look at it, you remember that you took away something that meant a lot to me.\"\n\nIf mom had been in her right mind, she'd never have given it away. (ESPECIALLY to this lady. Before Alzheimer's, my mom thought poorly of her. Ironic!)\n\nSo AITA for both asking for the piece AND expecting it to be returned?", "created_utc": 1668275136, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ytdp7z/aita_for_wanting_a_family_member_52f_to_return_a/", "score": 79, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Consult with an attorney.\n\nWhat does your uncle say or the aunt with who she was staying?", "Since you have POA and your mom is not able to make decisions about giving away her things, this woman would be seen in the eyes of the law as stealing. And I highly doubt the conversation between she and your mother ever even happened.  She just took it. Get a lawyer. And, obvs, NTA.", "NTA\n\nTake her to court, you will get the painting back that way. Especially if you explain the situation, and being her POA the judge will tell the aunt she knew what she was doing was wrong.\n\nI am guessing though that the aunt is getting so angry because she actually sold the painting or ruined it somehow.", "did you explain what it means to you and how you mother promised to give you adter she dies? I would make the life of this lady living hell. Don't just let it go. Go see a lawyer or the police if you have to. NTA", "NTA. As Power of Attorney, you should get a lawyer to send a strongly worded letter requesting its return. That should do it. No one should be removing the articles of an estate belonging to a person with dementia prior to fair distribution of assets being determined after death as per the will. If goods must be disposed of to pay for care for someone, the POA is responsible for determining what and how disposal happens. End of story. Anything else is theft.", "NTA - If it's that important I'm sure there is a legal case to be made here.", "NTA. It doesn\u2019t matter if it represented a meaningful conversation between them.

IMO there are 3 AH at play here:\n\n- Your aunt never corrected her mistake.\n- Your mom's brother is disowning his sister.\n- And of course the AH wife\n\nYour are NTA in any way and I truly hope you can find a way to get your mother's artwork back and honor her wishes.", "Nta you need to do something about this because that\u2019s yours it\u2019s your mother who made that for you, she has no right to anything she has and the fact that she would ask an old woman with those issues to give her anything makes her the asshole.", "Oooh boy, am I familiar with Alzheimer's... lost my paternal grandmother to it a few years back, I can empathize with how painful this is. NTA for this instance, legally this is probably theft. Even if the other party may argue it was willingly given, that argument loses credence when your mother may not have had the mental faculties to coherently consent to giving the drawing. Your uncle may argue this as a lawyer, but you were the one with POA if I am reading right, so I think the law will side with you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Can't the rest of your family help you get it back?", "100% NTA! Your comment was not rude at all. The family member knows exactly what she is doing and how much this is hurting you. The family member took advantage of your mother's state in order to get what she wanted from her (something that she did not create and has no right to own). I cannot believe the entitlement of that woman. Some people have some nerve. That artwork belongs to you and I am so sorry things have turned out this way.

If that does not solve it, do the same thing with her husband. Tell your uncle how your mother promised you the drawing and that she was not in any shape to agree to give it up to his wife. Is there any family member you trust? Because simple thing would be someone steal it back if they have access to their house. If none of this works, talk to a lawyer, maybe this can be a police case, she took something from your mother when she was mentally incapacitated.", "This is a pretty standard theft case though. Her defense is that she had a 'meaningful conversation' with someone who isn't legally considered able to consent. In other words, her *own* defense is that she took something without permission. I'm not sure there's such a thing as a lawyer expensive enough to make that work.", "If you have POA isn\u2019t this considered stealing and you can get police involved", "Why would you give this up without a real fight?", "Bummer, sounds like you ought to take anything precious of your mother's that you want home with you.
