They were cruel bullies and my brother's wife was more focused on pretending she could mother all the children and ignore the fact her kids hated my niece and nephew. When my niece and nephew asked their dad if he would leave his wife so her kids wouldn't be so mean she changed.

I even spoke to his wife. I tried everything to get them to open their eyes to the fact my niece and nephew's lives were being made hell by the older children.

They went to the therapies suggested but the kids were still bullying my niece and nephew. The case worker requested they separate the kids for a period of time until the older children could treat them better. But my brother refused to move out of the house or have his wife leave.

I do understand the mindset of including them but I agree that it is not always best. I've been in that situation a lot woth mynown family. Your kids will appreciate that you took the burden off of them instead of allowing them to make the decision and be seen as the bad guys.\n\nAnd I'm calling them your kids because as far as I am concerned, they are. Any parent who chooses a marriage over kids, young kids from being bullied, is someone who doesn't deserve the title of parent.
