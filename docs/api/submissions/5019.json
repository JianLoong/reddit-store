My brother is their father. Their mother died when my nephew was born. My brother stayed single for two years and then met a new wife and married her a year later. His wife had children who despised the fact their mom remarried and did not want my brother's children around. They treated them horribly. They were cruel bullies and my brother's wife was more focused on pretending she could mother all the children and ignore the fact her kids hated my niece and nephew. When my niece and nephew asked their dad if he would leave his wife so her kids wouldn't be so mean she changed. She thought they saw her as their mom but I suppose hearing over and over from her kids that they weren't, alongside knowing they were in their lives because she was, made it hard for a true bond to form, given the extent of the bullying.\n\nI had spoken to my brother on a number of occasions. I even spoke to his wife. I tried everything to get them to open their eyes to the fact my niece and nephew's lives were being made hell by the older children. In the end I started to call CPS for concerns, and once the kids were both in school and concerns were brought (my nephew begged to stay in school and not go home repeatedly and he was only in kindy) and they reported it, CPS intervened. They went to the therapies suggested but the kids were still bullying my niece and nephew. The case worker requested they separate the kids for a period of time until the older children could treat them better. But my brother refused to move out of the house or have his wife leave. He said his marriage was just as important as the kids and so they looked for a kinship placement which my husband and I agreed to. The only reason things got to this stage is because of the level of behavior and hatred the older children showed my niece and nephew. Kids not getting along in the home is not a reason for CPS to take this action. But the level of this paired with the negative impact on my niece and nephew is why this came to be.\n\nMy husband and I still have custody, because nothing has changed with my brother's family. He no longer sees the kids and the kids have not wanted to see his wife, while she out of guilt I think, wanted to remain part of their lives. My parents understood that no contact would be made outside of any court ordered time. They stopped talking to my brother for a time. But now they are acting all friendly with him and they invited him for Christmas. I only found out because my sister told me. So I called and told them we would not be going. They made a point of saying reunification was important/good and how this would be Christmas going forward. So I told them we would not spend Christmas together again.

If your brother had been half as \"aggressive\" in addressing his own kids' welfare, none of this would be happening.  \n\n\nGood for you for being those kids' champion, it seems as though they badly need one.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You are most certainly not \"throwing away your niece and nephew's family\" - you are in fact showing yourselves (you and your husband) to be the best kind of family, one that puts the safety and comfort of the children first. The kids don't \"need family\" - they have you both.", "NTA, your parents need to open their eyes to the fact that your brother decided his wife and her children were more important than his own. Just how hard did they try to get her children to not be bullies to babies? His wife may have had hood intentions but the fact that the behaviour of her own children was allowed to be so bad for so long is pretty appalling. \n\nWell done for sticking up for your two and being the adults they need to stand up for them.", "NTA you are the only one protecting those kids", "I can\u2019t even imagine how bad the older kids treated your niece and nephew to warrant CPS removing them from the home. \n\nNTA you are their guardian, you have custody of those kids. You owe it to them to keep them safe.  \n\nChristmas is not the time for them to see their dad who didn\u2019t protect them and stood idly by while they were being abused by their step siblings. \n\nIf he really wanted to reunite with them it wouldn\u2019t be throwing them into the deep end on a major holiday, he would be making steps in their everyday life.", "NTA. You are doing what should have been done by your brother, protecting those children. You brother is a pathetic excuse for a father if he doesn\u2019t want to see his own children because he loves his wife more and she\u2019s a bad person for not stopping her monsters from bullying two children. What a waste. Your parents are hoping that Christmas will do it\u2019s magic and all will be right with the world, but until your brother actually chooses to care about his own children there is no point. One day when he suddenly finds he has no relationship with them and he wants it, I am sure the kids will tell him to get bent and he will deserve it. Be what those kids deserve and tell your parents to get with the program and stop pretending it\u2019s a happy family.", "Wow! NTA! Thank god those children have your in their lives. I can\u2019t believe anyone would abandon their children like that, and not protect them.", "NTA. Your brother made his choice. He chose his new wife over his children, and by association, her children. \n\nYour parents made the choice to support their son who abandoned his children. Choices have consequences. \n\nYou need to protect your niece and nephew and stay away from these people.", "I would ask the niece and nephew what they would like to do and respect their wishes.\n\nNTA, your reaction was normal because your parents tried to trap you instead of asking before inviting.", "NTA. Your niece and nephew need someone in their corner and you seem to be that someone. Don't let them convince you otherwise. Keep them safe.", "NTA So your parents think your niece and nephew need them the most now so they can be bullied during their formative years?  Your parents are the ahs.  \n\nAnd you aren't throwing the father and new family away.  They did that by not caring enough to be in their lives.\n\nYou are protecting those children, thank you from someone who was abused.", "NTA. I am shocked your brother threw away his children. They should not have to see him unless they want to.", "The relationship with the Bio-dad should be important.  But it has to be done at a time and place that fosters a healthy foundation.  Holidays are not that place.  Stick to your guns.  OP definitely NTA\n\nThank you OP for being such great family in the kids lives.", "Need more information. Please tell us those poor kids are in therapy and you discussed this matter with them.", "NTA.  Bless you for what you're doing for those kids.", "NTA\n\nThose kids have had a rough time and you a doing a fine job of protecting them - and continue to do so by not going to your parents for Christmas. \n\nReunification is good - but during the holidays that would be utterly horrible and absolutely destroy any good that the season bings for the kids and for you. \n\nStick to your guns. Maybe suggest visiting once your brother has gone", "NTA I'm so sorry your parents have put you in this position but you are doing the right thing for the kids here. I'm so glad they have you to protect them.", "NTA and those kids are so lucky to have you in their lives. I\u2019m shocked that he\u2019s made no attempt to see his children? And your family is saying that YOU are throwing away your niece and nephew\u2019s relationship with their father when he\u2019s made no effort to see them? That\u2019s asinine.", "Nta protect those little ones no matter what", "NTA at all, you and your husband are the only people who have these children's wellbeing as the primary goal. You are generous and kind.", "The absolute cheek of your parents telling you you're throwing away your niece and nephews' family. \n\nYou have literally saved them from a) a horrible situation and b) the emotional fallout from that would have come later in life. \n\nAnd you have kept the kids in the family. Without you, in the worst case they could have been removed and placed in foster care. \n\nTaking on someone else's kids (even family) is a huge responsibility, and not everyone could have done what you and your husband have done. The whole family should be thanking you. \n\nKeep protecting your kids. You're doing the right thing. \n\nBest to be strong and keep the boundary now, else they'll keep pushing.", "You don\u2019t go from 0 contact to spending Christmas together, invited through someone else. Don\u2019t put this decision on the kids. You\u2019re doing the right thing. God bless you and your hubs being there for those kids.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nThe court appointed you the job of protecting those kids, and that's what you're doing. If their father wants to be part of their lives again, he can follow the process outlined by the court. He hasn't bothered. It's not for your parents to decide it's time to reunify.", "You're NTA. Your parents are not helping, they're interfering in a situation that they don't have the training or (apparently) the compassion to properly handle.", "NTA.  Your whole family seems hell bent on destroying these kids.  I'm glad they have you to stand up for them and make things right.", "NTA\n\nIt is understandable that the grandparents would like their whole family to get along. The story OP tells is kind of heartbreaking.\n\nBut forcing everyone together on Christmas Day without any kind of therapy or other preparation is a recipe for a horrible Christmas Day for all concerned. And additional layer of trauma for the niece and nephew.\n\nReunification has to happen slowly. It can only happen if everyone involved wants it. And it would need proper support from trained therapists and the like. None of which are currently present.\n\nKeep those kids safe, OP.", "NTA. Your parents are suported your brother, Who prefer is new wife and her children Who bullied his owns children to the real victims, your nephews. \nTell your parents that your job is kepp safe these childrens, and the way to do that its to keep apart from the bullies and the people Who abandon them.\nThey chose and now you are making your part.", "NTA. Well have you first asked the kids if they think they're ready for a Christmas together? Maybe it would be good. Definitely I would watch all of the kids carefully. And I wouldnt let them sleep elsewhere than one room with me and husband, just in case of some \"Canadian\" night. However their opinion and feeling are the most important.
