So I let them stay home when they\u2019re having really bad cramps. That doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re missing school every single time they\u2019re on their period. Daniella missed one day this year because of cramps and Brianna got dismissed from school once this year because cramps. \n\nToday they both were having bad cramps. I let them both stay home. Julian asked if he could stay home too because the girls are. I said no. He got upset and said it wasn\u2019t fair that they get to stay home because of cramps \u201cwhich don\u2019t even hurt\u201d. I told him \u201cYou know what\u2019s not fair? That they have to suffer while you don\u2019t. I\u2019ll let you stay home whenever you\u2019re sick or in pain, but I won\u2019t let you stay home when you\u2019re fine not just because your sisters are.\u201d He said \u201cfine\u201d and went off to school. \n\nI had to miss school because of cramps a few times in high school and being at home in excruciating pain was much worse than being at school and feeling fine.

The fact that he doesn\u2019t think cramps actually hurt isn\u2019t a surprise, because grown men believe this for some dumb reason, but educate him. Give him some comparison points- has he ever been kicked in the testicles, or had a really bad stomachache with bloating and gas? Talk it out with him before he grows to be the kind of man we all despise.", "NTA. I appreciate you for being understanding of your girl\u2019s pain. Periods can be hard and they haven\u2019t missed school for cramps often. Your son is fine, he is young and doesn\u2019t understand.", "NTA. He isn't in pain or sick, so he still needs to go to school. Simple.", "Please take your daughters to the dr to get properly checked out and make sure everything is OK with them. \n\nI'm not sure if you've done that but if you have get a second opinion. \n\nYou're NTA for letting them stay home however I think you missed an opportunity here with your son. When he said they don't even hurt you should have taken the time to sit him down and explain things to him. He's 13, he has no idea what's going on with his sisters he's just hearing they got cramps they're stating home. He's probably comparing that to when he gets a cramp or a belly ache or something. \n\nWhen you told him they have to suffer and he doesn't that's to me was a little unwarranted. They aren't suffering because of him and you don't want to say stuff like that as it can lead to resentment. You also don't want him to start thinking you'd prefer it if he was the one suffering\n\nI suggest that you sit him down and have an indept conversation with him. It will only help him to be more compassion and set him up to be a good partner in future.", "NTA. I had cramps so bad I couldn't even get out of bed, and I slept all day. Finally at age 16, I got put on the pill and boy, it was night and day! No cramps, full of energy.", "Nta. They were out sick. You may want to give your son an in depth, clinical explanation of periods in the event some woman needs to live with him one day. Feeling he has the right to judge the legitimacy of something he'll never experience isn't gonna go well for anyone.", "NTA.  People's bodies are different, kids need to learn that people have different experiences and people are treated differently because of it and that is perfectly fair.  If he has pain, he can stay home.", "NTA: and your son's line of reasoning is concerning - negating what women are feeling and suggesting it's fake is not a good path for him to go down.", "NTA. I\u2019m a guy but can appreciate that women have a very valid reason to miss school and/or work when they\u2019re having their periods. Besides, I am sure that some male health professionals dismiss or downplay these concerns and it can be a teaching moment for your son once he cools off.", "Have you gotten your daughters checked to see if they have PMDD or any medical reasons for the debilitating cramps?", "NTA\n\nWhere did your son get the idea that cramps \u2018don\u2019t even hurt\u2019? That child needs serious education to counter what he\u2019s picking up from unreliable sources.", "NTA\nProps to you for letting your daughters skip school when their cramps are especially bad. I tend to get pretty painful cramps too sometimes and having to go through that while trying to focus on school work can be full on hellish. \n\nNow I\u2019m not a parent but I do think should try to explain to your son just how bad period cramps can get for some people. I know he\u2019s 13 but given that he\u2019s a boy it\u2019s possible that he\u2019s never really been taught that much about periods at school, doesn\u2019t make what he said okay but explaining it to him might help him to better understand.", "NTA. They were sick, he was not. Simple as that. Probably want to educate him some more", "Dear men in this thread who think women should suck it up. I have never had any illness in my life come close to being as painful as period pain. I have rarely been as tired during illness as I feel when period is coming up and the first few days of my period. If men had periods too they surely would have let people stay home from work that time of month already.", "Oh, and I commend you for allowing your daughters to stay home. I don't remember being allowed to stay home, but there were days that they got so bad that it gave me stomach cramps, too, causing me to vomit. That was it. If it was just cramps, no matter how bad, I had to go to school.", "NTA - That child need to learn.  He has no clue.", "NTA as someone who has crippling periods I wish my parents would have let me stay home for some of them. What you should do is show the videos of men reacting to the period cramp simulators. \nI\u2019m glad you let your daughters stay home because the amount of men and even women who gaslit me growing up was appalling. Keep sticking up for your daughters!  \nAnother think you can do is just help educate your son. I know it can be uncomfortable, but I doubt reproductive education has really improved since I was his age. Some school split up the boys and girls so that they only learn about their anatomy and not the opposite birth assigned sex.", "NTA - you did the right thing. Otherwise, you'll simply be reinforcing the thinking that he is entitled to whatever others have.", "NTA. Every child is different, and it's a foolish person that tries to treat each child the same. That being said, maybe arrange for your son to get some mom-kiddo time too, on the weekend maybe.", "NTA I had to miss school as well. If the cramps got bad enough I would actually vomit-that happened in the middle of the hallway even at school, so I know how that feels. As soon as my mom would agree to it I got on the pill just to help with the cramps (way back in the 80s).", "Every time I get a cramp, they hurt so bad to the point I have to stop breathing because any movement might triggered badly . NTA", "NTA but it doesn\u2019t need to be so adversarial, man vs woman. Just explain that they are in pain/sick and potentially why. \n\nThen give him a swift kick in the nuts and explain it\u2019s kind of a similar pain and he can stay home tomorrow.", "Nta, thanks for being an amazing parent!", "Nta", "NTA. And aren't there medicines that can reduce the pain?", "NTA. period cramps are the worst. There is a sanitary napkin company called Pink Anee. those pads are really nice and they even reduce the cramps and flow also, Try that. Its really comfortable also", "ESH, if they get the ability to stay home your son should get a couple of days a year to do the same. Call it a mental health day or something.", "NTA but it sounds like Julian needs a stern lecture on what it's like to have periods.", "Get the period cramp simulator. He will change his mind quickly on how periods are not painful.", "NTA\n\nYou did the right thing. There is no valid reason for your son to stay home and miss school. He might be jealous of his sisters staying home, but he should not be jealous of their pain. They are not staying home for a lazy luxury day. They stay home because they are in pain.", "NTA. Your son should consider himself lucky that he doesn't have to get a period.", "NTA and your son needs to learn to respect women more and not belittling them and saying their pain is not real.", "NTA - I used to miss a day almost monthly because I was in so much pain and couldn\u2019t stop vomiting. I would\u2019ve much rather felt fine and gone to school every time.", "Nta.\n\nI had pain so bad I needed codeine and days off of school.\nWorking sucks as it is harder to take time off as I only have a limited amount of sick days.", "Time to hook him up to one of those pain simulators", "INFO\n\nOP you're N-T-A but did you or your daughters ever get checked out for endometriosis? Could explain the super painful periods.", "NTA. I had major pains when I was younger. Once in 8th grade, I tried to just work through the pain. I I went down to the bathrooms and I must have passed out as the next thing I remember is one my classmates coming in and said oh shit, you\u2019re on the floor. The school had to call paramedics. That was the day I was put on birth control.", "NTA, though I would also extend the idea of \"mental health days\" to all the kids if you don't already. As long as they're not taking advantage of it, I think getting the occasional break is good. But I swear, if cis men got periods we'd get 3 days off a month standard. I don't even get bad period cramps often but when I do it's miserable.", "NTA \n\nI get he is 13, but him saying \u201cthey don\u2019t even hurt\u201d is kinda concerning a bit. Because if he honestly believes this then THAT is who your son will be in the world\u2026..which isn\u2019t good. Is it he doesn\u2019t believe it hurts or he is just saying normal teenage BS because he isn\u2019t getting his way?
