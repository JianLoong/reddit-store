He is my pride and joy, just the sweetest most caring little man. Anyways, for the past year I have been trying to talk to my wife about not asking our son if he wants to do something that he doesn\u2019t have a choice in. (i.e bathing, brushing his teeth, taking his allergy medicine, etc.) The only reason I don\u2019t like her doing this is because when given the option to say no he of course doesn\u2019t want to stop what he\u2019s doing to go do it. She then proceeds to get angry with him and start yelling at him. We practice a no hitting type of parenting but yelling at him makes him break down into a ball of tears like you just struck him. I have myself implemented not asking him for things he has to do and it has worked perfectly. I still get a little whine out of him if he is playing with toys, however he gets up and does what he\u2019s told. \n\nFast forward to tonight. My wife had a few of her friends over and asked our son if he wanted to go lay down in the bedroom so her and her friends could watch tv. (He was watching blippi and finishing up his dinner at the time.) Naturally, he said he didn\u2019t want to because his show wasn\u2019t over yet. Then comes the yelling. I honestly think some of her friends may have been shocked by the looks on their faces. I come running up from the kitchen thinking something bad must have happened. Once I found out what it was and saw our son just on the couch crying I lost it. I hollered at her \u201cI have told you to quit asking him if he wants to do things he has to, if you continue to treat him like this he\u2019s going to learn to hate you. You are acting just like your fucking mother\u201d And I do feel bad for yelling at her and especially doing it in front of our son, but I just felt I had to defend him. Now she\u2019s locked herself in our room and refuses to talk to me because I embarrassed her in front of her friends. Not once has she checked on our son. He is currently curled up with me while I type this. I\u2019m starting to feel like maybe I was the AH for snapping like that but at the same time I feel like enough is enough.

Verbal abuse is still abuse and if she\u2019s yelling at him and traumatizing him that\u2019s an issue. Especially if he typically does what he\u2019s told.\n\nEdit: I was verbally abused by my mother and my father often would make it better/defend me. I don\u2019t think he ever knew how bad it really was. He loves/loved her and that can blind people to some things. Currently my parents are still married. I talk to my dad often but my mom rarely. Sounds like the road you\u2019re headed down if she continues.", "NTA, in life not everything is a choice. as a parent it is your job to teach this to your child. Not sure what your wife is thinking since she makes him do it anyway, but you seem to have a handle on what is proper in taking care of your son.", "NTA. If she's feels it's appropriate to go off on someone like that for a non-emergency situation in front of her friends then it should be perfectly acceptable for the same to occur to her.", "Oof. This is a tough one for me between E S H and N T A. Ultimately, I\u2019m going with NTA. Generally, I am not OK with yelling at your spouse, particularly not in front of the kid, but it sounds like this is a recurring theme, and I\u2019d be horrified if I made my daughter sob that way. \n\nAnd I agree - you don\u2019t ask if it\u2019s meant to be a requirement. The yelling is terrible, but she is also teaching him not to trust her - she leads him to think he has a choice and then goes off when she doesn\u2019t like the choice he makes. That is super problematic. Let the dust settle and then have a hard conversation with her. You should apologize for losing your temper, but don\u2019t apologize for defending your kid and honestly, demand that she change her ways here, even if family counseling is what\u2019s needed. I am flummoxed that she doesn\u2019t understand the harm she is inflicting.", "NTA\n\nSometimes assholes need to be humiliated in order to learn a lesson. If she doesn't change I'd leave her.", "NTA\n\nShe was humiliating her son by yelling at him in front of her friends. \n\nAnd she wasn't upset because you 'embarrassed her' she was upset because she'd clearly been in the wrong - you and her shocked friends being like wtf abt it", "NTA. Now she knows how he feels. Also, her method doesn\u2019t even work so it\u2019s dumb of her to keep doing that. All she\u2019s doing is teaching her kid to not be straight forward which isn\u2019t healthy.", "NTA, I\u2019m concerned why she\u2019s not checking on her son? I would be embarrassed that I continued to parent the way you mentioned bc it\u2019s working and helping your son learn to speak up and give his opinion when asked a question. If you continually ask him and he doesn\u2019t have a choice. He\u2019s being conditioned to believe it doesn\u2019t matter if he is given a choice or not. He\u2019s being yelled at for answering no when yes is expected. Your wife needs to take her parenting job seriously and not put so much importance into her friends opinions", "NTA. Where did she get this idea to ask him before doing anything then when he says no, she yells at him.\nThis is going to get far more worse if you don\u2019t stand up and do something .", "As much as I usually would say it\u2019s not okay to yell at your spouse especially in front of your kid I\u2019m going with NTA. She needs to stop making him think he has a choice and then yell at him when she doesn\u2019t like his answer he\u2019s 4 of course he rather finish his show or keep playing instead of brushing his teeth or taking his meds so by asking him hey you wanna do x when he really doesn\u2019t have an option is just setting him up to give her a \u201cbad\u201d answer and teaches him that he can\u2019t trust his mother because he doesn\u2019t know what answer will make her snap at him which will make him feel like he has to walk on eggshells around her which is not okay.", "The only part I feel you\u2019re TAH on is not saying something sooner. You\u2019re his parent, too and you\u2019re allowed to stop something you know is unhealthy and damaging to him. Step in every time she starts. As a parent, I understand you feeling fed up in the moment but you don\u2019t want your son to witness you reaching that point. All he really understands is daddy yelling at mama.", "NTA. I was raised with some things we have choices about and some you don\u2019t. The no choices were the exact same things you talk about. And giving him the choice then yelling when he doesn\u2019t pick what she wants him to pick is harmful to his mental health. And yes he will hate her for it-guaranteed. And some times our children need to see us taking their side against someone, even the other parent, who\u2019s being hurtful. If it continues, he will never trust your wife when he\u2019s older. I think on this you might end up needing couples counseling so your wife gets a professional opinion in the harm she\u2019s doing. You mentioned her mother being the same way so this is how your wife thinks she\u2019s supposed to be parenting. And it could need professional intervention to get her to stop.", "NTA!!!!! The fact that she is focused solely on being embarrassed instead of how she is emotionally manipulating your son says a lot. I think there needs to be clear boundaries set about how to raise your son. The fact that she is unwilling to compromise is a problem. Honestly, unless she\u2019s willing to fix her behavior it\u2019s going to escalate & get worse as he gets older! You are right in not giving him the option to say no on things he must do. It\u2019s literally setting him up for failure by taking the path your wife has chosen. He\u2019s a child. They shouldn\u2019t get to decide, bedtime, what they eat or when, or if they brush their teeth. It\u2019s our job as parents to teach responsibility and that there are always consequences for our actions good or bad! You are NTA for sure. Unfortunately, it looks like you now have to teach your wife these things. For that I\u2019m sorry! Your kids should come first no matter what!!!", "NTA, mostly. You were wrong for being as cruel with your remarks (I\u2019m assuming her relationship with her mother isn\u2019t peachy or you wouldn\u2019t have said it), but they did need to be said. \n\nThere are absolutely times when giving a choice about a necessary thing is ok, such as asking if he\u2019s ready for bed so she can watch tv. However, if you present a choice, he has a choice. How she\u2019s handling it sucks. \n\n\u201cDo you want to go to bed so I can watch tv without you?\u201d\n\u201cNo. My show isn\u2019t over.\u201d\n\u201cFair enough. Well, you need to go to bed, but I\u2019ll give you 10 more minutes. Do you want the ten minutes and then have to stop wherever that is, or would you rather go to bed now?\u201d\n\u201cLater.\u201d\n\u201cOk. Ten minutes.\u201d\n[10 minutes later] \u201cok. Turn it off, put your dishes in the sink, and head upstairs. It\u2019s time for bed.\u201d\n\nIf you offer the choice, you can\u2019t rescind it because it wasn\u2019t the answer you wanted. You can only work with what you offer. She needs to learn that.", "NTA  I think it's a woman thing.  My mom does it, too.  I've never heard of men doing it.  It's never a pleasant thing, usually a chore, so of course the answer is no, no one WANTS to do whatever it is.  \n\nThere are times when kids can have choices...  \"Do you want to get into your PJs now, before your last show, or after?\"  \"Please help me wash dishes, do you want to wash or dry?\"  But if \"No\" is not an acceptable answer, don't make it an option.", "You tried the polite, kinder way and she refused to listen and kept on emotionally abusing the son you share. Maybe now she will actually listen and do better. I'm not for yelling at your partner in front of others, especially not in front of a child but this is an ongoing issue that needs to be resolved one way or another. Don't apologise because it'll send the message that everyone you said was wrong but do discuss it.\n\nNTA", "ESH.  The way she is asking him is a habit. It works with some kids, not with others.  It takes a moment to break a habit.  If she was treated in the same way by her mother, then some patience is needed.  I suggest counselling for both of you. \n\nYou should not have embarrassed her in front of her friends but she should not be yelling at her child.", "NTA- maybe now she realizes getting yelled at doesn\u2019t feel good\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Sooo she's upset with you for doing what she does to her own (very young with zero emotional intelligence) child?!?! Hmmmmm", "Whoa. She\u2019s perpetually TA, you\u2019re temporarily TH. The kid I feel sorry for.", "NTA\n\nHitting and yelling are both not suitable for good parenting.

She's a mom, not the kid's girlfriend. \n\n2. Blippy is a grown ass man who acts like a child. Children should see adults acting like adults. You're setting an example in his mind of a man that is weak mentally and physically. He's going to be 30 crying on the couch if you let him keep watching that shit. \n\n3. You're a man.  Act like it.  You're not an asshole, you're a father with responsibilities to his family. Keeping things in line is one of those responsibilities.  \n\nYou have some serious changes to make.", "Tough. ESH. \n1 Therapists encourage age appropriate choices to build skills and confidence, but those choices should still include what you want them to do. It can be, \"Do you want to get your pajamas on and then watch 30 min of TV, or do you want to watch the TV then get your pajamas on?\" OR \"which story do you want tonight before bed?\" Basically, they choose the order, the privilege, timeframe, etc. (when it can be flexible), but ultimately, they don't have a choice of not doing it at all. \n\n2. It sounds like your wife's communication style is indirect. My spouse is the same way. Those with an indirect communication style won't flat out say, \"do this\". It's often framed as a choice or suggestion. With that said, her yelling at your son because he doesn't \"get\" that it is an order rather than a choice, is NOT ok. It is the parents responsibility to meet the communication style of the child, not the other way around. \n\n3. You yelling at your wife in front of her friends or your son was not ok. Though the intent was to protect your child, you don't match anger with anger, especially with an insult to her.", "Well yes and no. Doing it in front of the kid is the same as her yelling at him. No for in front of the friends because maybe she\u2019ll take a look at her behavior", "I'm torn here.  NTA in that your heart is in the right place... but to me, the delivery is what got you in trouble.  The comment about acting just like her mother feels like a punch below the belt and crosses into AH territory \u2013 an apology might be in order for that.   It seems like you let your emotions get the best of you.  I don't think you're wrong for wanting to encourage a parenting style that works better for your son, but you may need to apologize to your partner for how you delivered the message.", "NTA. Your wife is abusing your son. Verbal abuse can cause just as much physical damage and pain as physical abuse, that\u2019s why your son curls up and cries. This breaks my heart.\n\nAlso, your wife\u2019s friends probably WERE quite shocked to not only find out she abuses her child, but also to witness it.", "2 parts:\n\nyour child: NTA!  children learn certain things from parental actions.  if she asks and he says no, but is still forced to do it, he is being taught:\n\n\\- what he wants doesn't matter\n\n\\- no doesn't mean no\n\nif he has to do something he should be told to do it.\n\nyelling at your wife though...ESH", "What's missing in this scenario is the voice of a parent.

That was also a child response.\n\nA much better option would have been to avoid the yelling and  \"your just like\" attack. A disappointed look could have been sufficient. The actual child needed encouragement and a reminder of the role arrangement you'd made. Consistency is more important than being forceful with children.\n\nESH", "She needs to stop yelling at him.

I do agree with you trying to help your wife on the asking versus telling technique.

An Apology is absolutely in order.", "ESH\nShe was wrong, and you were really rude. It's ok that you want to protect your son, but there were a lot of ways you could do it that didn't involve yelling and humiliating your wife.

Sounds like you spoil him or want to spoil him.", "Sorry, but YTA. Not for your reasons, which are incredibly important. But for embarrassing your wife, and I'm sure your wife's friends, too. You yelling at her is not an effective way to address the situation in the same way that her yelling at your son isn't. I fear he will learn that yelling is an effective way to get your way. I sympathize enormously with your situation; you are worried about your son and your attempts to address it have fallen on deaf ears. If trying to reason with your wife is not working, perhaps suggest counseling. It's important for your son, but you clearly already know that. Best wishes to you.", "You are a great parent for standing up for your son and trying to end his mom\u2019s emotional and verbal abuse. But \u2026 you just added more yelling into the mix. I get why you did it. But now your son may be afraid that if he doesn\u2019t please mom, then situation might get even more scary when you, the more emotionally trustworthy parent, also loses it. For that, for the effect on your son, YTA. In all other respects, good for you for trying to end your wife\u2019s abusive treatment of your poor kid. Honestly this should be a marriage ender if she doesn\u2019t accept she has a problem and change her ways. Your son deserves an emotionally safe home, which he doesn\u2019t have at the moment. A 4 year old should not feel pressure to read his mom\u2019s mind to avoid getting yelled at.", "YTA, 1 for thinking your wife wouldn\u2019t be exactly like her mother, 2 for raising a brat.", "To answer your question, YTA for calling your wife out in front of her friends and speaking to her that way. In their eyes you are the real AH here and believe me, everyone has now heard how you treat the mother of your child.  Now, is your wife wrong? 100%. You never ask a child if he wants to wear a sweater on a cold day, you ask if he wants to wear the red sweater or the blue sweater. In cases where medicine is required there may not be options. Unfortunately you lost sight of the issue at hand. You owe your wife and her friends an apology. Then maybe find a parenting class for the two of you to take.", "YTA for making a scene in front of your wife's friends.  It helped nothing.  The only purpose it served is to make everyone, including your son think both of his parents are unhinged.  Defending your kid is reasonable and necessary.  Timing, however, is everything.  I think it is important to consider that if you do not want your wife to yell at your son, you should not be yelling at her.  Because that makes you a hypocrite.", "YTA.  What you just did was every bit as damaging to your son as your wife\u2019s bad habit of wording commands as questions.  Probably far worse.  You do not yell at the other parent in front of a child.  A real dick move.\n\nAnd yelling at your wife in front of her friends was even worse.  Yes, some of them may have raised their eyebrow at her way of managing her son.  But that was quickly forgotten as they absorbed the fact that their friend\u2019s spouse was verbally abusive to her.  I expect a couple of those friends will be asking her if she feels safe around you and even encouraging her to take her son and leave before your violence escalates.  Not saying it will, but abusive asshole isn\u2019t a good look for anyone.\n\nDoes your wife need to communicate more effectively with your son? Yes.  And she needs help learning how to do it.  But not from you.  Just because you in your sanctimonious wisdom believe you have found the perfect way to communicate with your son, it doesn\u2019t follow that you are the person to teach her.  Or that your way of doing it is even right for her. She needs help from someone experienced in parenting effectively and coaching other parents.  And someone who doesn\u2019t throw her mother\u2019s lousy parenting in her face.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
