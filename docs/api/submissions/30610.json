He is my pride and joy, just the sweetest most caring little man. Anyways, for the past year I have been trying to talk to my wife about not asking our son if he wants to do something that he doesn\u2019t have a choice in. (i.e bathing, brushing his teeth, taking his allergy medicine, etc.) The only reason I don\u2019t like her doing this is because when given the option to say no he of course doesn\u2019t want to stop what he\u2019s doing to go do it. She then proceeds to get angry with him and start yelling at him. We practice a no hitting type of parenting but yelling at him makes him break down into a ball of tears like you just struck him. I have myself implemented not asking him for things he has to do and it has worked perfectly. I still get a little whine out of him if he is playing with toys, however he gets up and does what he\u2019s told. \n\nFast forward to tonight. My wife had a few of her friends over and asked our son if he wanted to go lay down in the bedroom so her and her friends could watch tv. (He was watching blippi and finishing up his dinner at the time.) Naturally, he said he didn\u2019t want to because his show wasn\u2019t over yet. Then comes the yelling. I honestly think some of her friends may have been shocked by the looks on their faces. I come running up from the kitchen thinking something bad must have happened. Once I found out what it was and saw our son just on the couch crying I lost it. I hollered at her \u201cI have told you to quit asking him if he wants to do things he has to, if you continue to treat him like this he\u2019s going to learn to hate you. You are acting just like your fucking mother\u201d And I do feel bad for yelling at her and especially doing it in front of our son, but I just felt I had to defend him. Now she\u2019s locked herself in our room and refuses to talk to me because I embarrassed her in front of her friends. Not once has she checked on our son. He is currently curled up with me while I type this. I\u2019m starting to feel like maybe I was the AH for snapping like that but at the same time I feel like enough is enough.

Verbal abuse is still abuse and if she\u2019s yelling at him and traumatizing him that\u2019s an issue. Especially if he typically does what he\u2019s told.\n\nEdit: I was verbally abused by my mother and my father often would make it better/defend me. I don\u2019t think he ever knew how bad it really was. He loves/loved her and that can blind people to some things. Currently my parents are still married. I talk to my dad often but my mom rarely. Sounds like the road you\u2019re headed down if she continues.", "NTA, in life not everything is a choice. as a parent it is your job to teach this to your child. Not sure what your wife is thinking since she makes him do it anyway, but you seem to have a handle on what is proper in taking care of your son.", "NTA. If she's feels it's appropriate to go off on someone like that for a non-emergency situation in front of her friends then it should be perfectly acceptable for the same to occur to her.", "Oof. This is a tough one for me between E S H and N T A. Ultimately, I\u2019m going with NTA. Generally, I am not OK with yelling at your spouse, particularly not in front of the kid, but it sounds like this is a recurring theme, and I\u2019d be horrified if I made my daughter sob that way. \n\nAnd I agree - you don\u2019t ask if it\u2019s meant to be a requirement. The yelling is terrible, but she is also teaching him not to trust her - she leads him to think he has a choice and then goes off when she doesn\u2019t like the choice he makes. That is super problematic. Let the dust settle and then have a hard conversation with her. You should apologize for losing your temper, but don\u2019t apologize for defending your kid and honestly, demand that she change her ways here, even if family counseling is what\u2019s needed. I am flummoxed that she doesn\u2019t understand the harm she is inflicting.", "NTA\n\nSometimes assholes need to be humiliated in order to learn a lesson. If she doesn't change I'd leave her.", "NTA\n\nShe was humiliating her son by yelling at him in front of her friends. \n\nAnd she wasn't upset because you 'embarrassed her' she was upset because she'd clearly been in the wrong - you and her shocked friends being like wtf abt it", "NTA. Now she knows how he feels. Also, her method doesn\u2019t even work so it\u2019s dumb of her to keep doing that. All she\u2019s doing is teaching her kid to not be straight forward which isn\u2019t healthy.", "NTA, I\u2019m concerned why she\u2019s not checking on her son? I would be embarrassed that I continued to parent the way you mentioned bc it\u2019s working and helping your son learn to speak up and give his opinion when asked a question. If you continually ask him and he doesn\u2019t have a choice. He\u2019s being conditioned to believe it doesn\u2019t matter if he is given a choice or not. He\u2019s being yelled at for answering no when yes is expected. Your wife needs to take her parenting job seriously and not put so much importance into her friends opinions", "NTA. Where did she get this idea to ask him before doing anything then when he says no, she yells at him.\nThis is going to get far more worse if you don\u2019t stand up and do something .", "As much as I usually would say it\u2019s not okay to yell at your spouse especially in front of your kid but I\u2019m going with NTA. She needs to stop making him think he has a choice and then yell at him when she doesn\u2019t like his answer he\u2019s 4 of course he rather finish his show or keep playing instead of brushing his teeth or taking his meds so by asking him hey you wanna do x when he really doesn\u2019t have an option is just setting him up to give her a \u201cbad\u201d answer and teaches him that he can\u2019t trust his mother because he doesn\u2019t know what answer will make her snap at him which will make him feel like he has to walk on eggshells around her which is not okay.", "The only part I feel you\u2019re TAH on is not saying something sooner. You\u2019re his parent, too and you\u2019re allowed to stop something you know is unhealthy and damaging to him. Step in every time she starts. As a parent, I understand you feeling fed up in the moment but you don\u2019t want your son to witness you reaching that point. All he really understands is daddy yelling at mama.", "NTA. I was raised with some things we have choices about and some you don\u2019t. The no choices were the exact same things you talk about. And giving him the choice then yelling when he doesn\u2019t pick what she wants him to pick is harmful to his mental health. And yes he will hate her for it-guaranteed. And some times our children need to see us taking their side against someone, even the other parent, who\u2019s being hurtful. If it continues, he will never trust your wife when he\u2019s older. I think on this you might end up needing couples counseling so your wife gets a professional opinion in the harm she\u2019s doing. You mentioned her mother being the same way so this is how your wife thinks she\u2019s supposed to be parenting. And it could need professional intervention to get her to stop.", "NTA!!!!! The fact that she is focused solely on being embarrassed instead of how she is emotionally manipulating your son says a lot. I think there needs to be clear boundaries set about how to raise your son. The fact that she is unwilling to compromise is a problem. Honestly, unless she\u2019s willing to fix her behavior it\u2019s going to escalate & get worse as he gets older! You are right in not giving him the option to say no on things he must do. It\u2019s literally setting him up for failure by taking the path your wife has chosen. He\u2019s a child. They shouldn\u2019t get to decide, bedtime, what they eat or when, or if they brush their teeth. It\u2019s our job as parents to teach responsibility and that there are always consequences for our actions good or bad! You are NTA for sure. Unfortunately, it looks like you now have to teach your wife these things. For that I\u2019m sorry! Your kids should come first no matter what!!!", "NTA, mostly. You were wrong for being as cruel with your remarks (I\u2019m assuming her relationship with her mother isn\u2019t peachy or you wouldn\u2019t have said it), but they did need to be said. \n\nThere are absolutely times when giving a choice about a necessary thing is ok, such as asking if he\u2019s ready for bed so she can watch tv. However, if you present a choice, he has a choice. How she\u2019s handling it sucks. \n\n\u201cDo you want to go to bed so I can watch tv without you?\u201d\n\u201cNo. My show isn\u2019t over.\u201d\n\u201cFair enough. Well, you need to go to bed, but I\u2019ll give you 10 more minutes. Do you want the ten minutes and then have to stop wherever that is, or would you rather go to bed now?\u201d\n\u201cLater.\u201d\n\u201cOk. Ten minutes.\u201d\n[10 minutes later] \u201cok. Turn it off, put your dishes in the sink, and head upstairs. It\u2019s time for bed.\u201d\n\nIf you offer the choice, you can\u2019t rescind it because it wasn\u2019t the answer you wanted. You can only work with what you offer. She needs to learn that.", "NTA  I think it's a woman thing.  My mom does it, too.  I've never heard of men doing it.  It's never a pleasant thing, usually a chore, so of course the answer is no, no one WANTS to do whatever it is.  \n\nThere are times when kids can have choices...  \"Do you want to get into your PJs now, before your last show, or after?\"  \"Please help me wash dishes, do you want to wash or dry?\"  But if \"No\" is not an acceptable answer, don't make it an option.", "You tried the polite, kinder way and she refused to listen and kept on emotionally abusing the son you share. Maybe now she will actually listen and do better. I'm not for yelling at your partner in front of others, especially not in front of a child but this is an ongoing issue that needs to be resolved one way or another. Don't apologise because it'll send the message that everyone you said was wrong but do discuss it.\n\nNTA", "ESH.  The way she is asking him is a habit. It works with some kids, not with others.  It takes a moment to break a habit.  If she was treated in the same way by her mother, then some patience is needed.  I suggest counselling for both of you. \n\nYou should not have embarrassed her in front of her friends but she should not be yelling at her child.", "NTA- maybe now she realizes getting yelled at doesn\u2019t feel good\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Sooo she's upset with you for doing what she does to her own (very young with zero emotional intelligence) child?!?!

She's a mom, not the kid's girlfriend. \n\n2. Blippy is a grown ass man who acts like a child. Children should see adults acting like adults. You're setting an example in his mind of a man that is weak mentally and physically. He's going to be 30 crying on the couch if you let him keep watching that shit. \n\n3. You're a man.  Act like it.  You're not an asshole, you're a father with responsibilities to his family. Keeping things in line is one of those responsibilities.  \n\nYou have some serious changes to make.", "Tough. ESH. \n1 Therapists encourage age appropriate choices to build skills and confidence, but those choices should still include what you want them to do. It can be, \"Do you want to get your pajamas on and then watch 30 min of TV, or do you want to watch the TV then get your pajamas on?\" OR \"which story do you want tonight before bed?\" Basically, they choose the order, the privilege, timeframe, etc. (when it can be flexible), but ultimately, they don't have a choice of not doing it at all. \n\n2. It sounds like your wife's communication style is indirect. My spouse is the same way. Those with an indirect communication style won't flat out say, \"do this\". It's often framed as a choice or suggestion. With that said, her yelling at your son because he doesn't \"get\" that it is an order rather than a choice, is NOT ok. It is the parents responsibility to meet the communication style of the child, not the other way around. \n\n3. You yelling at your wife in front of her friends or your son was not ok. Though the intent was to protect your child, you don't match anger with anger, especially with an insult to her.", "Well yes and no. Doing it in front of the kid is the same as her yelling at him. No for in front of the friends because maybe she\u2019ll take a look at her behavior", "I'm torn here.  NTA in that your heart is in the right place... but to me, the delivery is what got you in trouble.  The comment about acting just like her mother feels like a punch below the belt and crosses into AH territory \u2013 an apology might be in order for that.   It seems like you let your emotions get the best of you.  I don't think you're wrong for wanting to encourage a parenting style that works better for your son, but you may need to apologize to your partner for how you delivered the message.", "NTA. Your wife is abusing your son. Verbal abuse can cause just as much physical damage and pain as physical abuse, that\u2019s why your son curls up and cries. This breaks my heart.\n\nAlso, your wife\u2019s friends probably WERE quite shocked to not only find out she abuses her child, but also to witness it.", "2 parts:\n\nyour child: NTA!  children learn certain things from parental actions.  if she asks and he says no, but is still forced to do it, he is being taught:\n\n\\- what he wants doesn't matter\n\n\\- no doesn't mean no\n\nif he has to do something he should be told to do it.\n\nyelling at your wife though...ESH", "What's missing in this scenario is the voice of a parent.

That was also a child response.\n\nA much better option would have been to avoid the yelling and  \"your just like\" attack. A disappointed look could have been sufficient.

Sounds like you spoil him or want to spoil him.", "Sorry, but YTA. Not for your reasons, which are incredibly important. But for embarrassing your wife, and I'm sure your wife's friends, too. You yelling at her is not an effective way to address the situation in the same way that her yelling at your son isn't. I fear he will learn that yelling is an effective way to get your way. I sympathize enormously with your situation; you are worried about your son and your attempts to address it have fallen on deaf ears. If trying to reason with your wife is not working, perhaps suggest counseling. It's important for your son, but you clearly already know that. Best wishes to you.", "You are a great parent for standing up for your son and trying to end his mom\u2019s emotional and verbal abuse. But \u2026 you just added more yelling into the mix. I get why you did it. But now your son may be afraid that if he doesn\u2019t please mom, then situation might get even more scary when you, the more emotionally trustworthy parent, also loses it. For that, for the effect on your son, YTA. In all other respects, good for you for trying to end your wife\u2019s abusive treatment of your poor kid. Honestly this should be a marriage ender if she doesn\u2019t accept she has a problem and change her ways. Your son deserves an emotionally safe home, which he doesn\u2019t have at the moment. A 4 year old should not feel pressure to read his mom\u2019s mind to avoid getting yelled at.", "YTA, 1 for thinking your wife wouldn\u2019t be exactly like her mother, 2 for raising a brat.", "To answer your question, YTA for calling your wife out in front of her friends and speaking to her that way. In their eyes you are the real AH here and believe me, everyone has now heard how you treat the mother of your child.  Now, is your wife wrong? 100%. You never ask a child if he wants to wear a sweater on a cold day, you ask if he wants to wear the red sweater or the blue sweater. In cases where medicine is required there may not be options. Unfortunately you lost sight of the issue at hand. You owe your wife and her friends an apology. Then maybe find a parenting class for the two of you to take.", "YTA for making a scene in front of your wife's friends.  It helped nothing.  The only purpose it served is to make everyone, including your son think both of his parents are unhinged.  Defending your kid is reasonable and necessary.  Timing, however, is everything.  I think it is important to consider that if you do not want your wife to yell at your son, you should not be yelling at her.  Because that makes you a hypocrite.", "YTA.  What you just did was every bit as damaging to your son as your wife\u2019s bad habit of wording commands as questions.  Probably far worse.  You do not yell at the other parent in front of a child.  A real dick move.\n\nAnd yelling at your wife in front of her friends was even worse.  Yes, some of them may have raised their eyebrow at her way of managing her son.  But that was quickly forgotten as they absorbed the fact that their friend\u2019s spouse was verbally abusive to her.  I expect a couple of those friends will be asking her if she feels safe around you and even encouraging her to take her son and leave before your violence escalates.  Not saying it will, but abusive asshole isn\u2019t a good look for anyone.\n\nDoes your wife need to communicate more effectively with your son? Yes.  And she needs help learning how to do it.  But not from you.  Just because you in your sanctimonious wisdom believe you have found the perfect way to communicate with your son, it doesn\u2019t follow that you are the person to teach her.  Or that your way of doing it is even right for her. She needs help from someone experienced in parenting effectively and coaching other parents.  And someone who doesn\u2019t throw her mother\u2019s lousy parenting in her face.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She needs to learn how to gentle parent bc as someone who\u2019s parent was verbally abusive when angry it ruins your fucking life. It\u2019s very good you protected him. Wtf is wrong with her? Her mom was abusive so she thinks it\u2019s ok to do that shit? Jesus, she needs to apologize and get into therapy. Like trauma therapy. Im fucking serious. I recommend Internal Family Systems. Good for childhood trauma and such", "YTA for flipping out in front of guests. But holy, how come she\u2019s not listening to your idea that actually works. It\u2019s not fair to your son.", "NTA. I'm glad you stood up for your son. It's her own fault for using a method (asking like he has a choice) that doesn't give her the desired outcome. \nI sincerely hope she stops this behaviour, but I think she first needs therapy to deal with her own upbringing for that, concluding from your comment that she is acting like her own mother. It's hard to break cycles without therapy. Not impossible, but hard.", "NTA at all. \n\nGood. She got what she deserved.", "ESH she yells at your son, you yell at her. What a wonderful family dynamic. She owes your son an apology and you owe her an apology. She can continue to ask her son if she wishes but she cannot shout at him if she doesn\u2019t like his response. That\u2019s verbal abuse", "NTA\n\nAlthough you were harsh on your words, you had to put your foot down. She is basically doing bad parenting. When given a choice and the person says NO, then that NO has to be RESPECTED, however she's indirectly teaching your son that it's okay to let people walk over you even though you have said NO. Your son may soon make it a habit of normalising people not respecting  his choices.", "NTA\n\nYou're right. And she's also right to be embarassed. However, the fact that she did the same exact thing in front of her friends (whose opinion of her apparently matters since she's hiding in shame) is a sign that she probably doesn't understand why that's wrong. \n\nAs a side note: unfortunately, shame is the feeling that always works and will always teach you something. It's ugly, but that's how it is. Shame works even on people with disorders that struggle to feel emotions in general. I'm not saying that we need to shame people more or that you need to shame her, but this will probably make a dent and it could open the channel more and fit communication about the issue.", "If she's going to ask him, she needs to stop giving him yes/no questions (ie, do you want to go brush your teeth), and instead give him options that align with what she wants (ie, do you want to brush your teeth now or after your bath?). Kids don't understand \"requests phrased as rhetorical questions\" very well, and shouting him to tears is only going to make him terrified of upsetting her. This is how you raise kids that are people-pleasers to their own detriment. Nip that shit now, OP.", "I agree with NTA. \n\nI grew up with a mom that was VERY similar to OP's wife. She would always ask me things like 'could you do \\_\\_\\_\\_ for me?' or 'would you like to \\_\\_\\_\\_?i I still have quite a bit of built up resentment for that and I remember when I was a teen I snapped once and asked her why she would even ask me if I don't have a choice anyway? Of course that ended up instead being a lecture about how I disrespected her. \n\nDoes your wife think giving the illusion of choice makes her seem nice? Tell her to stop being delusional and be a real parent already instead of trying to maintain some sort of moral high ground or whatever bullshit this sort of attitude is trying to achieve.", "She\u2019s teaching him not to trust her OR HIMSELF. She asks a question, he answers honestly, and she screams at him. Now he doesn\u2019t trust his mom not to hurt him if she doesn\u2019t like his answers, and he doesn\u2019t trust himself to choose the right thing. Can he even tell yet which questions have right answers?", "You do give them a choice: Do you want to brush your teeth before you get in pajamas or after? Do you want to brush with the purple brush or the blue one? NTA", "It's his wife.... Humiliating her in front of friends and his son ? Come on. When we have a disagreement me and my wife, we take it privately, not in front of our kids. His wife is wrong on the way she asks her kid, but the way he managed this situation was really bad.", "I think she's genuinely humiliated about being yelled at in front of her friends because:\n1. She didn't see anything wrong in yelling at her child while they were there\n2. OP has asked her to stop many times and she doesn't meaning she genuinely believes that is the right way to parent \n3. It probably reminded her of her mom berating her while her friends were visiting.\nOp wasn't in the wrong for his reaction. It reminded her of what it feels like to be on the receiving end of a verbal abuse. She won't see it that way though and she won't change either. I hope OP leaves her abusive self and has a safe space for his child away from her", "He did say something. He stated they have had multiple conversations about not giving the son options when it\u2019s something he must do.", "Also, kids need to see that families can argue and come together again. To make a child think a couple never argues is a falsehood they could take into a relationship in the future.", "\"Control your woman\"\n\nStop being an incel.", "This is my take too, embarrassing her in front of her friends could be the wake up call she needs.\n\nThat poor kid witnessing it when he was already worked up couldn't have been good at all. I think it was an understandable reaction based on the history but coming from a former very anxious kid (whose mother sounds scarily similar to the one in this story), seeing my mum and dad yell at each other used to terrify me that they'd stop being together and I'd be stuck with mum (the scary parent who never stopped yelling), he may need a little extra reassurance right now.\n\nI am currently no contact with my mum. The issues are a lot deeper than her just yelling at me about everything, but the mum in this story is on track to lose her relationship with her kid when they're an adult if she doesn't change.", "I would not say it's the easiest. If a mom can go into 'mother bear' mode to defend their child I don't see why a father can't. He was in the kitchen without knowing the situation and heard yelling. He rushes up to see his son crying while his wife is yelling at him with her friends obviously being in a confused state due to the sudden and awkward escalation. \n\nIn this situation I would not blame him to instantly be in defense of his son especially considering the mom's track record. Honestly his wife embarrassed herself first in front of her friends by 'teaching' her child like that while there was company.\n\nI do agree the 'just like your mother' comment may have gone a step far but can see that coming out while emotions are running high but it does warrant a sincere apology.\n\nI can only go with E-S-H at most but as a child that also grew up with a parent similar to that 'mom' I would give a lot to have had someone defend me like that from such an unjust situation. So my vote is biased towards NTA.", "Seriously? When a mom constantly screams at her son to the point of him crying it's just not 'effective communication'? Telling your spouse not to abuse your child isn't sanctimonious, and screaming at a 4 year old is abuse. Yelling at your wife in front of her friends to STOP her from abusing your child is in no way worse than someone ACTUALLY abusing their child. Obviously the poster yelling at their wife isn't good either, but they did it after trying to talk to her calmly about this before.", "Also, you seem like a good father OP. I wish you the best", ">Does your wife think giving the illusion of choice makes her seem nice?\n\nThe trick she needs to learn is to give an actual choice that still gets the job done.  \"I need you to go lay down in the other room.  Do you want to walk in there by yourself or do you want a piggy back ride?\"  Or \"It's bath time.  Do you want to use the red wash cloth or the green one tonight?\"", "If they don't do something this kid's going to go through hell with relationships. Imagine thinking this is normal and ok?", "The wife is abusive. So I don't give a shit.", "Pretty unlikely to make her change. If anything it will likely have the opposite effect.", "Ooooffff this is so good. I would never have thought of it", "Ahah exactly what I am doing. For example when it's time to get dressed for kindergarten I tell my daughter \"Do you want to wear a dress or pants today?\" Or before with my son during fall/winter: \"Do you want a long sleeves t-shirt then short sleeves on top of it or wife-beater then long sleeves?\"", "His intention was not to embarrass her, he was protecting his child. I don't agree with shouting at someone in any circumstances tbh which is why I said his reaction was *understandable* considering the situation and history behind it. Not that I think it was totally the best course of action lol\n\nShe says she's embarrassed that it happened in front of her friends, I would hope that would maybe cause her to assess her actions but I guess depending on her personality she may double down and stand by what she did and never change.\n\nHopefully they can have an adult conversation about what's happened, why he blew up, why she's constantly setting the kid up to be shouted at by her, and put the kids wellbeing as the first priority.\n\nLike I said, hopefully the kid is getting a little bit of extra reassurance after having witnessed a shouting match between his parents if he needs it.", "I didn't either.  I learned it from people smarter than me, but it totally works."]}
