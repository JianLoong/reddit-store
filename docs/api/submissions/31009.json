Make sure that your lawyer is aware of the conflict with your siblings, so that your will can be as ironclad as possible. Your siblings WILL dispute it, and Lea will not have funds to hire a lawyer to defend it (unless it is written into the will that estate funds will be used to defend the will? dunno if that's even a thing, but it sounds good). At the least, I believe you should specifically mention in your will that you do not wish to leave anything to your siblings or other relatives.\n\nBest of luck to you.", "you have a golden heart.\n\nbut, i want to point this out.\n\nyou must assign like a few people, a team to assist Lea with the law, the protection and anything that relates.\n\npeople could be awful, and especially when it comes to property as big as yours, anyone can harm a girl like Lea for their own profit.", "NTA\n\nWhenever discussion of inheritance comes up with my parents, my siblings and I all say the same thing - everything is completely up to them. If they spend every penny and sell their house before they die, and we inherit nothing? Up to them (and I say this as someone who could genuinely use the safety net of any money they leave). \n\nIt is your building, your business, and 100% your choice.\n\nOf course, if you want to, you could probably leave some money for the other members of your family, depending on what you have in the bank. But Lea is clearly your family in ways your siblings aren't. If you'd had children, and she was your granddaughter, it wouldn't even be a question of them inheriting. Either your children would, or she would. I don't see how this is any different. You see her as family, so she's family.\n\nI agree with the other post though, that it's worth setting up some sort of formal system to help her once she does inherit. Hopefully, given that you're 77, you'll have at least another ten years, maybe twenty or more (my grandma is currently 91), and by the time she inherits she'll be a grown woman with more experience of the world, but just in case it happens sooner rather than later, I'd talk to a lawyer about being there for her.\n\nI'd also talk directly to Lea (once you've fully made the decision, that is). Knowing this inheritance is in her future is a significant thing that will potentially impact how she lives now. Maybe she'll take her education further, or be able to save differently, or be able to spend more in an important life area when otherwise she was saving for a future home. I think she should know what you're planning. It will also likely mean a huge amount to her to know how truly you feel she is your family.", "Nta\n\nThey should not discuss your property like you are already dead", "NTA. I admire your choice. \n\nBut listen, I highly recommend you communicate this to your family before you die. They are likely to be angry and I'm sure you'd rather not deal with that. But they are under the impression they're getting it, and they will be surprised and angry whenever they find out they aren't. \n\nIf they get blindsided after you're gone, they will take it out on her (imagine them grilling her for how she tricked you into it or accusing her of taking advantage of you or opening a lawsuit to try to prove you weren't of sound mind, etc.) They may even stop by your business to harass her, badmouth her in the community, etc.\n\nDon't make her bear the brunt of their ire. Make your wishes known and answer their questions while you're alive. Tell them firmly it's what you want, you've thought it through carefully, and your mind is made up. Just my 2 cents.", "NTA. Good on you. It's such a caring and generous thing to do. Just make sure the reasons are clearly outlined in your will. It's harder for a court to overturn it then. I love your work!", "NTA. Use good attorneys and leave a small item , a book et al, to each of your siblings in the will so that they can't claim you forgot about them. Write a long letter to leave with the attorney to explain to your employee why you made this decision so they don't get guilty by your siblings no to accept the inheritance.", "NTA\n\nYou leave your assets to whoever you want. May want to leave small amounts to family so they can't contest the will. Your lawyer will tell you what you have to do. \n\nBut do leah a favour and add a letter or a video to the will where you explain the reasons why you left your assets to her and that she didn't knew about this and also didn't tried to influence or manipulate you.

Leaving everything to your employee is not a bad idea, and it's your decision who gets what from your estate.\n\nTalk to your lawyer and make sure your siblings have no legal claim to your estate. Talk to him also if it'd be a good idea to inform Lea about the will so she'd be prepared to face them when the time comes.", "NTA.  OP can do what they want with their property.

Pretty presumptuous considering you could leave your estate to charity etc. This young lady will be so blessed.  It's your stuff, leave it to whoever you want.

Enjoy what time you have left and don't give them a second thought", "NTA\n\nBut it may be best to give your employee some ownership interest in the business now.  Your business documents could possibly include a right to survivorship.  It would require some attorneys to help set things up, but might bypass probate, which would ensure that your your siblings have no ability to fight your will in court.\n\nFor instance, I'm envisioning a document where you give your employee a few percent of the business each year.", "NtA if she's more kin to you than they are,  leave it to her", "NTA. And I don\u2019t mind adding that your siblings are mercenary. You could tell them that you haven\u2019t left it to them, but they\u2019d likely start yelling their objections. The solution to guarantee yourself the most peace is just to let them find out for themselves. Speak to your lawyer to ensure that they can\u2019t contest the will.", "NTA, absolutely not the AH, what your siblings think is irrelevant, just make sure the will is watertight and there's no room for them to appeal it, suggest leave them all a tiny sum of money to stop them disputing.", "Right now, NTA.\n\nBut there is one thing that may make you an asshole in the future. If you spring this upon everyone, where they learn after your passing it will cause unnecessary drama and stress for your employee. \n\nIt shouldn't be her job to handle what your siblings may cause. Let them know beforehand that they won't be inheriting anything.", "NTA...you can leave your assets to whoever you want. Your siblings are being presumptuous.

It\u2019s beyond rude of them to be making plans for your things and before you\u2019ve even passed! My goodness! \n\nYou are free to leave your business and home to whoever you choose. I would mention to your attorney that your siblings may (or even are likely) to fight your wishes, so to make things iron tight. You might also either speak to Lea or leave her a note that indicates this is 100% your wish. She sounds like a nice person - she might feel guilty when your siblings start telling her how they deserve it more than her. A letter or something of the sort could give her some much needed reassurance should that happen.", "NTA. \nIt's not their inheritance, it's your belongings and YOU get to decide whom it goes to.\nI will never not find it tacky when people plan what to do with an inheritance before the person is actually gone, especially since they've apparently had in depth conversations about what to do with it even though getting an inheritance is never a guarantee. \n\nYou do what you think is right, but I'd suggest leaving them a bare minimum amount so they can't contest the will. Who cares if they're 'pleased'? It's not up to them.", "No, according to the AITA subreddit, you wouldn't necessarily be the bad guy for deciding to give your property to your employee Lea rather than your siblings. Since it's your property, you may allocate as you see fit in your will.\r  \n\r  \nWho you think would take the finest care of your property should be your first choice, along with your personal connections and ideals. everything's OK to leave everything to Lea if you have a close relationship with her and think she would manage the caf\u00e9 and flat well going forward.\r  \n\r  \nTo prevent misunderstandings and any disputes after your death, it is crucial that you share your choice with your siblings in an honest and transparent manner. It's ultimately up to you as the owner what to do with the property, even if they could have different views. To guarantee a smoother transition and reduce family conflicts, speaking with a lawyer and explaining your goals to all parties involved might be helpful.\r  \n\r  \nUltimately, the choice of who will inherit your property should represent your preferences and what you feel is best for the asset and your legacy.", "NAH.

Generally the brain is fully developed at 25 and she's probably not mature enough to handle all this either, and at the risk of sounding sexist, I also doubt you'd do this if it was a 19 y/o boy. \n\nInsane.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
