Make sure that your lawyer is aware of the conflict with your siblings, so that your will can be as ironclad as possible. Your siblings WILL dispute it, and Lea will not have funds to hire a lawyer to defend it (unless it is written into the will that estate funds will be used to defend the will? dunno if that's even a thing, but it sounds good). At the least, I believe you should specifically mention in your will that you do not wish to leave anything to your siblings or other relatives.\n\nBest of luck to you.", "you have a golden heart.\n\nbut, i want to point this out.\n\nyou must assign like a few people, a team to assist Lea with the law, the protection and anything that relates.\n\npeople could be awful, and especially when it comes to property as big as yours, anyone can harm a girl like Lea for their own profit.", "NTA\n\nWhenever discussion of inheritance comes up with my parents, my siblings and I all say the same thing - everything is completely up to them. If they spend every penny and sell their house before they die, and we inherit nothing? Up to them (and I say this as someone who could genuinely use the safety net of any money they leave). \n\nIt is your building, your business, and 100% your choice.\n\nOf course, if you want to, you could probably leave some money for the other members of your family, depending on what you have in the bank. But Lea is clearly your family in ways your siblings aren't. If you'd had children, and she was your granddaughter, it wouldn't even be a question of them inheriting. Either your children would, or she would. I don't see how this is any different. You see her as family, so she's family.\n\nI agree with the other post though, that it's worth setting up some sort of formal system to help her once she does inherit. Hopefully, given that you're 77, you'll have at least another ten years, maybe twenty or more (my grandma is currently 91), and by the time she inherits she'll be a grown woman with more experience of the world, but just in case it happens sooner rather than later, I'd talk to a lawyer about being there for her.\n\nI'd also talk directly to Lea (once you've fully made the decision, that is). Knowing this inheritance is in her future is a significant thing that will potentially impact how she lives now. Maybe she'll take her education further, or be able to save differently, or be able to spend more in an important life area when otherwise she was saving for a future home. I think she should know what you're planning.

Speak to your lawyer to ensure that they can\u2019t contest the will.", "NTA, absolutely not the AH, what your siblings think is irrelevant, just make sure the will is watertight and there's no room for them to appeal it, suggest leave them all a tiny sum of money to stop them disputing.", "Right now, NTA.\n\nBut there is one thing that may make you an asshole in the future.

I would mention to your attorney that your siblings may (or even are likely) to fight your wishes, so to make things iron tight. You might also either speak to Lea or leave her a note that indicates this is 100% your wish.

Who cares if they're 'pleased'?

The one thing I see missing is that you should definitely assign Leah as a beneficiary on a life insurance policy or retirement account that will provide her with cash. \n\nA life insurance policy is best for this.  I can see how you might not have one as you have no children. But if you do, making her the beneficiary will provide her with cash that she will need to hit the ground running.  Life insurance doesn't go through probate.\n\nIf your siblings are squabbling, it can put her in a position where even though she will eventually clearly own the business and the building, she is unable to keep it open and the business may fail.  Some cash on hand can really help with that.  You may also want to put her on some of your bank accounts. You would have her social security number because she's your employee. You could sneakily do this and just have the signature cards awaiting her signature. This is another way that your siblings wouldn't be able to tie cash money up. I said sneakily because you could add her but not tell her.\n\nI would talk to your lawyer about what it's going to take if probate drags on to 6 months. How is Leah going to keep the business open?  It might be worth it to even take a small loan out against the building for the amount of money she would need to keep it running for 6 months and put that money in a place where she can easily access it. \n\nI'm not a lawyer. This is definitely not advice as to what you should exactly do.  Just ideas. I've seen a lot of inheritance b******* go down in my highly dysfunctional family.  I would talk to a lawyer about how long a protracted probate brought on by your kin is going to take, and work with them to make sure Leah has access to enough liquid cash to get through that period of time.\n\nI am a landlord. I would make a 5-year lease on the building and business with Leah as the tenant with a monthly rent of $100 or $1, that way your siblings can't throw her out of the building because she has a lease. Talk to the lawyer about what specifically needs to be in there.  It also gives her the right to go in and out of the building, and a decent chance to say everything in your above the business apartment is her stuff.  Just another roadblock to protect her from getting steamrolled.  Make a monthly paper trail that shows that she's been paying you the dollar or the $100.  It could be as simple as giving Leah $100 in cash and asking her to write you a check for $100, you don't necessarily have to tell her why.\n\nIf you do tell her that you're leaving her all this stuff, make sure you also tell her that she needs to keep her mouth shut.

And possibly tell the siblings now of your intentions (Make it known to as many people as possible so they can't claim you intended otherwise). On one hand that may give them more time to fight it, but I think the benefit outweighs the risk.", "Seconding the others who say that this is both a very generous and perfectly rational thing to do, but think about how to protect this young woman from the avarice and jealousy of your siblings.\n\nIf you are in a position to do so, leave some money to your siblings. A sum like \u00a35-8k each may be enough to buy them off. They will be pissed off of course, but if they dispute the will, it will be stated that they will get nothing; this consideration may weigh with them. If you can afford to leave more than that for each of them, it could be money well spent; it's more bait on the hook. If they receive \u00a310-15k each then it can't be said that you didn't consider them, and (more importantly) it's a more potent disincentive to get litigious. Because if your will is airtight, then there is no upside for them to fight it. They lose everything they would otherwise have inherited. If you really don't have money spare, it would even be worth borrowing \u00a320k against the business in order to have this bribe ready, \u00a35k for each of them; if any one of them is an arse about it, that's \u00a35k in lawyers' fees to get them to eff off as they will then get nothing. The more money they get, the bigger the incentive to chill out.\n\nWith this in mind, be careful who you choose for your lawyer. You want someone who is not too meek, and who has experience of conflict. Don't automatically choose your oldest friend who happens to be a lawyer.\n\nYou also *must* tell Lea in advance, impressing on her both the importance of complete discretion - best she shouldn't tell anybody - and that your siblings will be unhappy. You should insure that she has access to all your important papers; either that she has keys to your flat, or that you keep everything she will need, in the event of your sudden passing, in the shop. You don't need to tell her this week, but she needs to know.\n\nAlso - introduce your lawyer to her and ensure that he/she is ready to offer her support, in the event your siblings cut up nasty. Have some cease and desist letters drawn up ready to go, if she needs to pull the trigger.\n\nRemember that when you die she will be grieving, she mustn't be blindsided by this intention of yours, along with your siblings' angry reaction. She needs to know in advance, so that she can adjust her own ideas of her future and be aware that there may be some trouble involved.\n\nIt may be necessary to close the business for a while after you have gone, you want to ensure that this is minimised, so it doesn't cause her financial hardship. When she is alone there, she will also miss you as a member of staff as well as a friend, it would be wise to have more staff in the wings to help her. Look at taking on a couple of additional part time staff, and guide her in how to manage and train them, but let them think of her as their boss. It will be good experience for her. Whoever you train may not be the same part time person who takes over when you go, the point is for the business to have the culture of people who support her, who she trusts. It will also be good for you to take less of an active role, partly for yourself to have downtime but also for you to have real confidence that she can manage without you.\n\nOne other thought, your assumption that she will be able to use the flat to cut down her expenses is a natural one, but if it is a decent flat it may make more financial sense for her to rent it out and continue staying wherever she is for now. Look into this too on her behalf, find out what the going rate would be from a lettings agency and familiarise yourself with the rights and responsibilities of tenants so you can leave the info for her. Ultimately she will certainly prefer to be living above the shop, but in the short term it may make more sense to view it as an income stream. This may be particularly useful if as I suggest you have borrowed something to bribe your siblings into compliance, the loan can be paid off that much sooner.\n\nLastly, act to minimise clutter in your flat. Get rid of all the stuff you don't need and never use. If you are a hoarder, now is the time to break that habit and clear things out, so it isn't a mammoth task for Lea to do.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA obvsly", "NTA.

There are a lot of missteps she can make, regarding the inheritance, the running of the business in general, and the management of the property in general. If this is something you both want to go forward with, introducing her to those advisors/mentors now, while you are also still here could really (1) set her up for a smooth transition AND (2) give her a connection to others who know and care for you - a comfort when you do pass.\n3.

It then gets tied up in the courts for awhile until it's resolved by the judge.  It's a small price to pay to make it easier for her getting the rest of the property/business/money.  Make sure that she retains your lawyer as her lawyer until the dust settles from the fallout.  You have to know that they will try to make her life difficult because she \"cheated\" them out of your money.  You are doing the right thing in this, it's your money that you earned and worked for. You can do what you want with it.  People donate to charities all the time in their wills.  Lea is the charity you chose.\n\nMay I also suggest that if she continues to run the place as you do, that on the anniversary date of your passing, that she has a cafe special in your honor.  50% off on a \"Robert's Blue Plate Special\" or something like that. Make it whatever your favorite dish is/was at the cafe.  Turkey and Swiss sandwich on squaw bread, chips and a drink kind of thing.  That should keep you in people's minds and stomachs for quite a long time.  Great way to be honored, in my opinion.\n\nBest of luck, I applaud you for not letting your family/siblings guilt you into doing something that is not in your heart.

Since your health hasn't been the greatest\u2026that could influence telling her sooner rather than later\u2026but she needs to understand that she should not tell anyone of your plans or her place in your will because that will get the secret out and once again you'll be criticized.", "Leave it to Lea, many shop owners have done this, left their business to a great staff member.

It may be true in some states, but please do not blindly follow this. Leaving $1 may create several issues, including accidentally granting inheritance rights to non-inheritors and creating additional friction in the estate by requiring the personal representative to deal with the $1 inheritor, which may delay closing and drive up costs. Plus, the $1 limit really just makes it so that if the will is contested by the person set to receive $1, they are risking the delineated inheritance: $1. Obviously, that doesn't change the calculus of the challenger.\n\nIn any case, talk to an attorney.

In fact it can open the door to contesting it by saying 'Clearly it was supposed to be a number larger than a dollar, they just forgot to write the rest of it'. You are supposed to specifically name them and leave that you are intentionally not including them.

What you do need to do is name them.   The will should name each and every sibling who could have a potential claim against the estate, and spell out what they are getting, even if it's nothing.    The concern is that if they aren't named, they can bring an argument that they were forgotten about, and it is murky.

At the very least, discuss the building/cafe/apartment and what can be done with them should Lea not want to manage the cafe forever. She may be dreaming of going off to college or something.

And that there are other ways to ensure that legally people are acknowledged/not forgotten without giving them an \"inheritable\" sum/item", "Anyone who isn't a direct relative (1st generation; none of this second-cousin-twice-removed stuff) would have no standing to contest, unless they could prove that they were beneficiaries in a previous will.", "It can also mean additional hassle and delays for Lea.  If the will is phrased as \"I leave $1 each to Tom, Dick, Harry, and Mary, and everything else I own to Lea,\" then Lea won't get anything until Tom, Dick, Harry, and Mary have all signed off that they've received their $1.  Which gives the siblings the power to introduce endless delays on purpose.\n\nDefinitely talk to an estate-planning attorney if you're thinking about doing something like this.  They can help you avoid unintended consequences."]}
