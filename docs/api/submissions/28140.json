{"id": 28140, "submission_id": "16yy2ef", "title": "AITA for not wanting to watch my brothers kids on our family vacation?", "selftext": "I\u2019m on vacation with my immediate family. I\u2019m F/30 and my two brothers are in their late 30s. They\u2019re both married and they each have kids (5 kids total ranging in age from 3-9 years old). My parents are also on the trip, and I am accompanied by my boyfriend of 2 years.\n\nWe\u2019re here for a week and it\u2019s been really fun so far. We have a mix of days where we have activities planned and then a few free days. My family has had a text thread going for months with all of the trip planning, so we knew which days were activity vs free days. \n\nMy boyfriend and I planned a romantic dinner for one of the free nights at a really nice restaurant on the island. We made a reservation months ago because it books up. \n\nI was getting ready to go out and one of my sister in laws made a comment about me dressing up to stay in. I was confused and asked her to clarify.\n\nShe said that she, my brother, and my other married brother and his wife, were doing a couples spa evening experience that they booked a few days earlier and they needed me and my BF to watch all of their kids. She said my brother was supposed to have asked me earlier that day. He forgot to. \n\nWhen I explained that my boyfriend and I already had plans, she was super unsympathetic. She said they already prepaid for the spa experience and since we hadn\u2019t paid for the dinner yet, it wouldn\u2019t make sense for them to have to cancel their plans. \n\nI never agreed to watch their kids. I love my nieces and nephews, but my family knows I am childfree and have been for years. It\u2019s been a point of contention for a long time. I wouldn\u2019t mind watching them if I had been given advanced notice, but to have them slapped on me when I had plans with my BF made me really upset. \n\nMy sister in law said I didn\u2019t understand how much she needed the time away from her kids because I don\u2019t have kids of my own. She said I was being selfish and I could handle one night of \u201cbeing a mom\u201d. \n\nIt\u2019s not the point. I would\u2019ve agreed if she had asked me months ago before my BF and I made dinner plans. I checked and we wouldn\u2019t be able to get another reservation before we leave. \n\nMy parents walked in on us arguing, and eventually they offered to watch the kids. They were supposed to go to a free concert on the beach together but decided to cancel so someone could stay with the kids. I felt really bad but my mom insisted. \n\nNow it\u2019s the next day and my sister in law won\u2019t even look at me. I\u2019m pissed at her too but we\u2019re stuck here for a week so I don\u2019t know what to do. My mom thinks I should apologize but I feel I\u2019m the one owed the apology here. \n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: forgot add - we are not staying in a resort/hotel that would have babysitting services, we\u2019re staying in a family friend\u2019s vacation house/rental property", "created_utc": 1696354265, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16yy2ef/aita_for_not_wanting_to_watch_my_brothers_kids_on/", "score": 202, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your SIL should be mad to your brother for not asking you for one thing. But they also should have asked you *before* booking.\n\nIt sucks that \"they need this\" but they are the parents and there are more options besides assuming you will do it and then trying to guilt trip you when you don't. \n\nIf you haven't already, you should talk to both of your brothers about this. You're their sister and they wanted you to watch their kids but thought it was fine not to ask and let your SIL bully you into it. That's a one-way ticket to never having you babysit. And your mom is out of line for asking you to apologize rather than a having a word with her son and DIL about how rude and immature they're being.", "\"She said I was being selfish and I could handle one night of \u201cbeing a mom\u201d.\"  \n\n\nWhy not ask really politely? Making accusations is not the way to get people to be nice to you. And accept a reasonable no? (You had made plans just like they had.

Expecting you to drop your plans last minute because *they* failed to make sure their plans were solidified is not reasonable.", "NTA. Yeah, it's a family holiday but they should of thought about this before it was all even sorted. You had plans with your boyfriend, they can't expect you to just drop everything because they want to go and get a massage. \n\nPeople have kids, they should plan for that and understand that someone isn't just going to drop their plans because the parents \"want a night off\" doesn't work that way. They could book a baby sitter at home and have a night off or plan more in advance for things like that. \n\nWhen you're a parent, your life becomes your children, those around you don't have to give up their plans to suit you just because their child free. \n\nYou're not in the wrong here at all", "NTA - this is all I needed to read:\n\n*My sister in law said I didn\u2019t understand how much she needed the time away from her kids because I don\u2019t have kids of my own.* \n\nCan't handle kids, don't have kids\n\n*She said I was being selfish and I could handle one night of \u201cbeing a mom\u201d.*\n\nNope.  Childfree means that you do not want to be a \"mom\".  Not even for a night.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSIL needs to put her entitlement in check and the fact that your brother did not step in is leaving my flabber absolutely gasted.  There is no part of this story that you are responsible for.  If your mother thinks that YOU should be the one to apologize, show her this post.  This IS a hill to die on and we are here to support you.  Hopefully you and your BF can find a way to enjoy the rest of the vacation.  All the best, OP.", "NTA. Your siblings and their significant others decided that you would be babysitting their children on vacation with a few hours notice, and one of them got mad when you said no. The entitlement is real. You're not their servant at their beck and call. If they had this spa day planned they should have asked you when they were booking it if you were OK babysitting. 1 of 2 things happened. 1- they just assumed you'd do it. 2- your brother forgot to ask when they were planning. Either way it's on them. Your sister in law needs an attitude adjustment and your siblings took you for granted.", "NTA. Your sister in law is behaving entitled, and she is also being incredibly nasty. Her kids, her choice. Not your f-ing problem. You were even being diplomatic about it. She can think what she wants, I'd just let her wallow in peace. \n\nEdit: grammar", "NTA\n\nThis reads like her plan was to dump them on you just as she's slipping out the door and pull the mom card if you objected. Such entitlement.", "NTA. Securing childcare is the FIRST thing a responsible parent does when planning a night out.", "Wow--NTA.\n\nYour brother and SIL are the AHs because he failed to ask you so they could make other plans when they learned you were busy, and your SIL for seeing herself as the victim in this scenario. Her entitlement is through the roof.\n\nCertain types of people use their parenthood as a bludgeon to browbeat other people....like they're doing the world a favour for producing children.", "NTA. Pick your phrase. \"Not my monkeys, not my circus\", \"Poor planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on mine\". Whatever works. Your mom is wrong about you needing to apologize, your SIL does to both you and your mom. To you, for being an entitled \"B\" by demanding you plans to accomadate hers, and is now sulking because you wouldn't, and to your mom for moaning about it so much that mom canceled HER plans to watch the kids.", "NTA \n\nBut i am curious why \"free\" days were not discussed in the family text thread. This goes for all parties in this story. A vacation of 13 is not easily to setup and definitely can cause chaos. \n\nYou don't need to apologize but I would definitely address the communication issue", "NTA. You should ask you mom exactly what it is she thinks you should apologize for.\n\nReview the facts with her \u2014 your siblings made plans assuming you would babysit; no one ever bothered to inform you or ask if you were willing to do it; when SIL was informed that no one mentioned anything to you and you had plans, instead of apologizing and then getting on her husband\u2019s case for his blunder she demanded you cancel your plans and take care of her kids anyway; *they* dropped the ball, but they were still able to have their spa time, yet now she\u2019s being a jerk to you.\n\nIn light of those facts, tell your mother she should talk to your brother and his wife and tell *them* to apologize, not you. You did nothing wrong. Period. Your SIL is acting like an AH, making things unpleasant for everyone instead of just acknowledging she was wrong to assume you\u2019d want to babysit without asking you.", "NTA\n\nYour sister expecting you to cancel your plans at the last minute because she thinks hers are more important is entitled as fuck.", "NTA\n\nThey failed to ask until the last minute.

Simple as that. I don't know that any of you owe the other one an apology though. I feel like if someone is owed an apology it's probably mom that should have one from your sister in law.", "NTA You don't schedule an activity with our lining up childcare first. Your brothers and their wives dropped the ball. Had they had the asked you before booking the spa, they would know you were unavailable.", "**NTA** \\- They should have asked you before they made the reservations/", "NTA!!!  Your family is being insanely presumptuous and inconsiderate. You aren't obligated to watch their kids nor to bail them out of the problem that they've brought on themselves. They should have run this by you months ago when it was being planned. I'm sorry it's become so tense and unpleasant but they are SUPER out of line here and I think you should hold firm.", "NTA I do not understand why these people think that anyone but the parents are responsible for their own kids. You don't owe them anything, they are acting like entitled assholes.", "Nta. It\u2019s my job to secure childcare arrangements for my kids before I make plans to go out. They didn\u2019t.

You are most certainly NTA.", "NTA. Their kids. Their responsibility. BTW. If you did agree to babysit. They should really pay you. You are not free labour because youre a relative. Lol! Could you imagine if you were off work sick and you called your SIL and asked her to clean your toilets? And put away your laundry? They would think youre insane. Dont get pushed around by Moms! They can act entitled.\n\nAlso. Five kids? In Canada a single professionally trained ECE student is allowed to manage four. So. Think about how much weight they want to throw on you. And believe if something goes wrong its going be your reputation that suffers. Not theirs.", "Nta that\u2019s really rude of them and SIL should be mad at her husband, the father of the children who didn\u2019t secure childcare", "Your mam is trying to keep the peace bless her but you have nothing to apologise for your a free women they chose to have kids they have to miss a few things", "NTA fuck dem kids.\n\nNot your responsibility, they can\u2019t just expect to plan a spa day around someone else looking after their own kids. You and your bf had plans, I hope you enjoyed them.", "He who sired the child shall arrange for care. \n\nNTA. \n\nHer monkeys her circus.", "NTA. How would you expect someone else to cancel plans they made months ago at minutes notice for anything other than an emergency? Her feeling like booking herself a spa without having the decency to tell you is not an emergency. And then to justify it by completely disrespecting you and your time? You are owed an apology for the rudeness and utter lack of consideration.", "NTA,\n\nThey have kids, not you. Not your responsibility just because you choose not to have kids is not an issue at all. You are not selfish. You choose how you want to spend your time. No one told them they had to have kids. As adults they knew they would want to do things and should have planned it MONTHS in advanced. They didn't, you couldn't do it so tough titties.", "NTA. I mean, even if your brother was supposed to ask you earlier in the day, they clearly had already booked their spa night, so asking you even a few hours earlier was still an afterthought, and they had every intention of having you babysit from the start and springing that little detail on you when she new it would be too late. I can't stand it when people do this. My uncle did this to me when we were on a family vacation, and just left my disabled cousin with me. I love my cousin, but was not asked, and while everyone else was out having fun, I was babysitting. My aunt noticed this after everyone came back, so she took me out for the rest of the afternoon, just the two of us, to kind of make up for it.", "You are definitely NTA. But I totally understand her devastation at thinking she had free time and didn\u2019t get it. However, she\u2019s mad at the wrong person. Your brother should have had this all figured out before you all got there. He is the AH for sure! Bet his wife packed his bag and all!", "NTA they didn't ask you to watch the kids (husband forgetting doesn't count as anything) and you made plans months ago for this evening. Your SIL and her husband are  in charge of their own child care and they know it. She should be mad at herself for not planning properly.", "You are NTA.  Your SIL definitely owes you an apology for assuming you would watch her kids.  She decided to have the kids so it\u2019s her and your brothers responsibility.  They were stupid booking something first without sorting out what was happening with their kids.", "NTA - Your mom thinks you should apologize? For...what? Having plans?", "NTA. SIL didn't even consider that you might have plans of your own to begin with. Like you would just do it because she is higher in status (due to being a parent). \n\nPlus it sounds like she's giving you the silent treatment, which is very passive aggressive and immature. I'm sorry your vacation is going poorly.", "Also, next time tell them your rate is $15/hr/kid. If that\u2019s too expensive\u2014that\u2019s not your problem", "NTA\n\nI am shocked by your SIL's entitlement here. You are not her defacto babysitter. You are entitled to enjoy your vacation as you please. If she and your brother wanted a night out, the obvious solution would have been to make arrangements with the other brother/SIL so that one parent team watched all five kids one night, and then another night they switched, allowing the other set of parents to get a \"date night.\" Not expect that they would dump five kids on their childfree sibling who had no desire to babysit.", "NTA. You are not free babysitting service on call. They should ask, you can decline anytime.\n\nThey have kids, they had prepaid service without proper babysitting plans, they forgot. Their lack of planing is not your emergency.", "NTA. And every single family member who makes it a \"point of contention\" that you are childfree is TA. This is probably where your SIL gets her sense of entitlement and resentment from\u2014she is overwhelmed and she's jealous that you are not, so she figures you owe her for it. Your brother \"forgot\" to ask you because it wasn't his idea.", "NTA.  Not your kids, not your responsibility.  I say this as a parent.  Yes, sometimes you desperately need a break. But you don't get to *demand* that someone watch your kids for you. Ask, beg maybe, not demand. And when the answer is no, you have to accept it. They should be mad at the brother who was supposed to ask. Any parent with an ounce of common sense knows that you don't make plans until *after* you have confirmed a babysitter.  Not just asked but confirmed.  If they really wanted to ask you, they should have done it before even leaving for the trip. They wanted to just dump the kids on you, but you didn't play into their game. You fought back. <gasp> Good for you. YOU HAVE NOTHING TO APOLOGIZE FOR.", "> She said I was being selfish and I could handle one night of \u201cbeing a mom\u201d. \n\nI would have thrown a comment back at her such as, 'Maybe I plan on proposing to my BF tonight - who's the selfish one now?'\n\nNTA, you have nothing to apologize for.", "Your SIL is flat-out fucking insane. You are NTA, not even close. The level of entitlement she is displaying towards *your* free time, is baffling to me.\n\nThey chose to have the kids, it is her problem, she should be mad at your brother, her husband, for failing to ask you, and furthermore, they are absolutely fucking stupid for not clearing or clarifying it with you much earlier than the day of, which even if your brother had asked you that morning, would be way too late.\n\nI have 2 kids, and I know how hard it is. This is why, when we have something going on, I have arranged my childcare literally months in advance, if possible, which this was.\n\nYour SIL is super lucky your parents offered to help.\n\nIn no way, shape, or form would I EVER consider apologizing for this, and I would be telling my own mother to shove it in this situation, the idea that you should apologize here is absolutely nuts.", "Definitely NTA.  \nIf they wanted you to watch the kids they should have mentioned with before the trip even began. People make plans on vacations. You made your plans and they made assumptions. That is a THEM problem. Don't let your parents deciding to keep the peace turn your sibling's problem into your problem. My mom does that crap too, because of one of my brothers, and I love her more than anything but that is her decision.", "NTA- send a message in the thread that you didn\u2019t come on vacation to be their nanny.", "NTA - sister in law is just entitled thinking you were free childcare. The fact that they didn\u2019t even bother to ask you before you went on the trip is super unreasonable. I have kids and I always try not to impose on my family to watch them on trips together. Why couldnt they just pay for a babysitting service on the trip (assuming this is some kind of resort). Your mom should also not be asking you to apologize.", "NTA If your sister-in-law needs a break from her kids, that's her problem. You are childfree for a reason. Be happy she's not speaking to you, since she sounds awful, and don't apologize.

Heck no. Don\u2019t apologize. Your SIL and siblings can\u2019t just assume\u2026 especially when it comes to short notice babysitting.

Lesson learned for them.. make sure a sitter is secured before committing to and paying for plans.", "NTA they failed to make arrangements for their child care, and you have plans.  Why didn't she immediately just say OK and ask your parents?", "NTA. The absolute entitlement. You're owed an apology. Definitely.", "Apologize?  NFW! They didn't ask, and you had plans.

I\u2019m F/30 and my two brothers are in their late 30s. They\u2019re both married and they each have kids (5 kids total ranging in age from 3-9 years old). My parents are also on the trip, and I am accompanied by my boyfriend of 2 years.\n\nWe\u2019re here for a week and it\u2019s been really fun so far. We have a mix of days where we have activities planned and then a few free days. My family has had a text thread going for months with all of the trip planning, so we knew which days were activity vs free days. \n\nMy boyfriend and I planned a romantic dinner for one of the free nights at a really nice restaurant on the island. We made a reservation months ago because it books up. \n\nI was getting ready to go out and one of my sister in laws made a comment about me dressing up to stay in. I was confused and asked her to clarify.\n\nShe said that she, my brother, and my other married brother and his wife, were doing a couples spa evening experience that they booked a few days earlier and they needed me and my BF to watch all of their kids. She said my brother was supposed to have asked me earlier that day. He forgot to. \n\nWhen I explained that my boyfriend and I already had plans, she was super unsympathetic. She said they already prepaid for the spa experience and since we hadn\u2019t paid for the dinner yet, it wouldn\u2019t make sense for them to have to cancel their plans. \n\nI never agreed to watch their kids. I love my nieces and nephews, but my family knows I am childfree and have been for years. It\u2019s been a point of contention for a long time. I wouldn\u2019t mind watching them if I had been given advanced notice, but to have them slapped on me when I had plans with my BF made me really upset. \n\nMy sister in law said I didn\u2019t understand how much she needed the time away from her kids because I don\u2019t have kids of my own. She said I was being selfish and I could handle one night of \u201cbeing a mom\u201d. \n\nIt\u2019s not the point. I would\u2019ve agreed if she had asked me months ago before my BF and I made dinner plans. I checked and we wouldn\u2019t be able to get another reservation before we leave. \n\nMy parents walked in on us arguing, and eventually they offered to watch the kids. They were supposed to go to a free concert on the beach together but decided to cancel so someone could stay with the kids. I felt really bad but my mom insisted. \n\nNow it\u2019s the next day and my sister in law won\u2019t even look at me. I\u2019m pissed at her too but we\u2019re stuck here for a week so I don\u2019t know what to do. My mom thinks I should apologize but I feel I\u2019m the one owed the apology here. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

NTA do not let them take advantage of you, or make your time or life seem less important because you don't have kids, their gross.", "NTA - why do parents always assume that anyone without children is at their beck and call to babysit?", "NTA. Your SIL was being an entitled brat. You don't owe anyone free child care. If she thinks it's so tough to be a mom, maybe she shouldn't have brought the kids on holiday.", "NTA - You. Had. Plans.  More than that, you made those plans MONTHS ago!  It's pretty damn presumptuous of her to think that you would be willing to cancel your date night for hers simply because they completely failed to ask if you'd be willing to babysit *before they booked their spa evening*!!!", "NTA, word of advice as a child free person.  Always book your own accommodations, never share with people that have kids. Never let them know your room number.", "NTA \n\nIf they\u2019re gonna continue being rude well I\u2019d tell your brothers going forwards not to ever ask again for free babysitting", "Nta what are you supposed to apologise for?

Remember, selfish = \u201chow dare you refuse to injure yourself in order to benefit me?!?!?\u201d\n\nSounds like your bro was tasked with asking, couldn\u2019t be bothered and now SIL is mad that you won\u2019t pick up for his mistakes.  And that means\u2026.absolutely nothing to you.  Cause it ain\u2019t your marriage.  I\u2019d put money that they made the spa day way in advance and she asked bro to get you to watch and he assumed you just would. She\u2019s got a husband problem.

My response would have been \u201cyou\u2019re right\u2026I don\u2019t know because I refuse to spew out kids that I secretly don\u2019t want.

I\u2019m a mom and I find this appalling. It\u2019s interesting how people will commit others to do them a favor without asking.", "Absolutely not!\n\nYou have nothing to apologize for and you should *not* do it.  Your SIL will then realize she can bully you into babysitting whenever she needs \"mommy time\".\n\nIf anything, you should wait until you are all together and then loudly say you wish to make an announcement.  Then look at your SIL square in the eye and say, \"Apparently it is necessary for me to say this,  but I am not nor have I ever been your kids' parent!  *You* created them, *you* are responsible for them!  Do not *EVER* attempt to foist them off on me without asking *ever* again.  The answer will always be 'not.  Are we perfectly clear?\"", "NTA.

Anytime my sister wanted me to watch my niece & nephew on a trip, she told me UP FRONT. On more than one occasion she paid for my trip in exchange for me watching the kids during a specific event. But again, she communicated that AHEAD OF TIME. \n\nYour SIL was rude.

It\u2019s not like her kids were left abandoned, they were taken care of. I don\u2019t understand why she\u2019s so mad at me today", "This!!! The stench of entitlement is overpowering. Just because OP opted not to have children does not automatically relegate her to babysit anybody else\u2019s children. You chose to have children.  That means you chose to accept responsibility for them. That means that you make plans accordingly and make sure that you have someone to watch your children should in case you want to do a date night. And in the event that you don\u2019t have someone to watch your children, you HUMBLE yourself and ask. You don\u2019t demand or belittle someone who doesn\u2019t have children.", "Because she can't just snap her fingers and make OP do whatever she wants, whenever she wants", "Bring that realistic heat!

She is mad because she expects that you will drop everybody for their children, regardless of your plans. She strikes me as extremely selfish and narcissistic- everything revolves around her. Do not apologize. If anything ask your brother why they thought it was ok to demand YOU babysit?  Don\u2019t let them guilt you for their wrongdoing", "She is probably jealous. She chose to be a mom and can\u2019t expect others to drop their plans because they want to do something. They are not entitled to your time and if being a parent is so hard they can find a babysitter when they return from the trip.

Her fragile ego might take a hit. NTA", "Because it\u2019s easier to be mad at you than at her husband.", "Exactly. I never said she did. People can do what they want.

I\u2019s their job to ASK you but you have 0 responsibility to agree.", "Doesn\u2019t matter. Unless you wrote it wrong, from what I understand they booked the spa a few days before and only asked, or supposed to ask, day of.

It was said no activity so just Plan for yourself.\n\nYour SIL wanted something from you. It\u2019s her Job to ask. When she forgets it\u2019s her Problem, Not yours.\n\n\nPS: I feel it\u2019s unbelievable selfish of your Brothers and SILs to Book an Arrangement before they asked you. As a normal Person you ask and then make your Plans.\n\nNTA", "Nah, you don\u2019t work for them so there\u2019s no reason you should have to keep them informed about your availability. That would only make sense if you had already agreed to generally be available for babysitting while on the trip. If that were the case, then of course you should inform them in advance that you wouldn\u2019t be available that specific night. Otherwise, she should have assumed you were not available until she *asked,* and she should\u2019ve been fully prepared for the possibility you would already have plans.", "I think it is wrong that NO one said anything about their plans and they never mentioned babysitting. \n\nShe/They are just as much in the wrong as you would be for the communication part. But you still are NTA \n\nIn my experience, usually having kids people will be more upfront about needing help and they did not do that so they can't blame you", "They may have discussed among themselves\u2026 but they should have asked you before making any bookings. They can ask or you can offer childcare .. but it should never be taken for granted that someone will do it. \nDon\u2019t apologize because you didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\nIf you do, be prepared that they will do this at every vacation since you have set a precedent of being bullied into what they want. \nSpeak to your brothers and let them know you would be happy to babysit in future, but will need advance notice, and that you don\u2019t appreciate the attitude from your sister in law when you didn\u2019t do anything wrong.", "I\u2019m not sure this reply was for me.", "The parents with little kids made assumptions and no one *asked*.

You preplan, and make sure your sitter agrees and is compensated....or you don't go.\n\nEven for family.. you don't dump 5 kids on a relative and don't compensate them in some fashion, you're an ass 5x if you don't. Thats how you eliminate the family as sitter options.", "Good catch", "She\u2019s equal wrong because she didn\u2019t check that they needed a sitter?  If this is what you said you are absolutely wrong.", "Agree - as long as they needed help from op it\u2019s on THEM to make sure op knows and is available.", "Definitely not what i was saying.
