She had dessert there as well, it was a large pumpkin pie from Costco.   My husband and I aren\u2019t fans of pumpkin pie, so I figured I\u2019d bring the apple pie and we\u2019d eat that.   The apple pie was from a pricey bakery, really small, and cost $40.  Anyway, everyone was packing up leftovers (the host encouraged us to take leftovers) and my husband hadn\u2019t had dessert yet.   There were about two slices left of the apple pie and well over half the pumpkin pie left, so I took the rest of the apple pie with me.  This past week, the host invited us to Christmas dinner and said \u201cthis time, leave some dessert for me too because I didn\u2019t even get to try the apple pie.   I was really bummed you took it\u201d.    I explained that my husband and I don\u2019t eat pumpkin, and that he hadn\u2019t had any dessert yet.   I did leave two pricey dips we didn\u2019t even open ($10 each) for the host, and a bottle of wine.   I can tell she was annoyed I didn\u2019t leave any pie, but there was plenty of the dessert she bought (pumpkin pie) left.

Usually \u201ctake some leftovers\u201d means \u201ctake a little bit of everything\u201d, not \u201ctake all of something.\u201d And you don\u2019t get to bank extras of one item that you didn\u2019t eat to take home.

I would be too embarrassed to chastise a guest for taking leftovers home.", "Personally, I think you're reading too deep into it. She regrets not having a slice of pie. We've all been there.

Who doesn't like to try new sweets?", "ESH.  It\u2019s definitely tacky to take back what you bought.  The only thing a guest should take is whatever the host offers but it was equally tacky of her to bring it up.  I\u2019m guessing she just wanted you to know so there wouldn\u2019t be a repeat but still, it shouldn\u2019t of been mentioned at all.", "ESH\n\nWhen you bring something to a host's home for a holiday dinner, you don't take what's left of that dish back home with you.  That's tacky.  (You may certainly take home leftovers that are explicitly offered to you by the host.)\n\nBut for the host to bring it up afterwards?  That's not acceptable.

If your husband haven\u2019t had any yet, he would\u2019ve been more gracious to leave a piece for your hostess. You had no way of knowing she had any either or not. It sounds like you\u2019re making judgments that she got a pie from Costco where you brought a fancy pie. As she was the hostess, at the very least, you could\u2019ve asked if she gotten any or not, and then left her a piece.", "NTA.  Maybe I live somewhere different than everyone else but I have never considered or seen it considered tacky or rude to take home leftovers from items you brought to a meal.   I had a small family with little to no extended family. We\u2019ve spent numerous holidays celebrating with a variety of friends over the years and it was always standard to pack up what was left of what you brought and take it home. If there was a lot left, you could offer to leave some for your host and they would likely do the same with the items they prepared. But it wasn\u2019t a must and with a small amount no one would have batted an eye at taking it home. Especially since she also brought a host gift. \nThe exception would be if you made a dish specially for the host. Like Betty loves blueberry pie so I made this just for you (or for your birthday, anniversary, etc) in this case the pie is both a contribution and host gift so you would leave it", "You brought a full meal!!!

Full stop. \n\nHam, two sides, dessert, two dips\u2026what, exactly, did SHE contribute aside from the house?", "NTA after your updates.\n\nIt's interesting how she was more than happy for people to take leftovers and told them to... but it was only when she realised that there was no apple pie that was then she got cranky.\n\nShe can always go and get one for herself and eat the whole lot and not even have to share.\n\nNext time I would be bringing less if you do go back to her house.  Never bring the apple pie again.  Leave that at home and have dessert then.\n\nYou left plenty.  Only take stuff you are happy to leave... so nothing expensive.\n\nWhat happens if she comes to your place for dinner?  Does she bring good stuff and leaves it?  Or does she bring cheap stuff and takes what isn't eaten back with her?", "YTA! You don't get to take your only contributions to a huge meal like that home!

I find the Costco desserts to be way too sweet.  I was surprised after leaving a nice bottle of wine, two dips, and a bunch of the ham I had brought for the host that she brought up not leaving the pie for her.", "I have a large family and it was the same - my mom would always say \u201cthere\u2019s so much food, please take some home!\u201d and people would always take what they brought.   Part of the reason I don\u2019t think this is rude because people have different food preferences.   I brought food my family likes to eat, so when there is a lot of food left my preference is to take home the food I cooked because I know it\u2019s the food we will eat.   Perfect example is the dessert.   I brought apple pie because no one in my family likes pumpkin.   There was a ton of pumpkin pie left, so I thought nothing of taking the apple pie because it wasn\u2019t like there wasn\u2019t dessert leftover for the host.", "I typically contribute a lot when she hosts parties at her house.   I have noticed a significant difference in the amount we spend though, so I think I need to scale back a bit.", "When people come to my house, whether they bring cheap or expensive items, I never care if they take what they brought with them.   In fact, I encourage it because they put the time/money into making it.   If I really like the item, I simply ask for the recipe or where they bought it so I can get it make it myself.", "What do you suggest I should have done when she said \u201cplease take leftovers, there is so much food left!\u201d.   There really was a ton of food!   She didn\u2019t tell everyone what to take, people mostly packed up the stuff they brought.", "Yes it was the disposable foil pan the pie came in.", "I'm going with a *slight* YTA unless you asked if you could grab the last of something. It's totality fine to make plates of leftovers if offered, but taking the *last* of something without asking the host is a bit of a dick move. \n\nAnd yeah you brought it, but I'd still bring it up before I boxed the last of it up. A fast \"I'm gonna grab the last of the pie if that's cool.\" would have at least given her the option to be gracious or say she wanted to save a piece for later. Especially since she didn't get a piece of it.", "But if she knew the pie was fancy, she probably wanted to try some herself.", "You\u2019re not wrong and how were you supposed to know she hadn\u2019t had any yet?

Anyway, I may have left it, but if there was a ton of other pie. I don\u2019t know. but regardless I don\u2019t think your in the wrong here, her calling you out is super tacky and definitely makes her TA. Maybe next time she just needs to eat a piece of pie if she wants one. \n\nPlus you left wine.

And I saw everyone packing up the stuff they had brought to bring home.  She probably didn\u2019t care about any of the other food except the pie.", "I didn\u2019t leave a piece of the pie I brought because she had a huge pumpkin pie left-like more than half.   She was saying there was no way they\u2019d be able to eat all the food and to please take leftovers.   I figured her and her family would be perfectly happy with pumpkin pie because that\u2019s the dessert she bought so I didn\u2019t see a problem with taking the two slices of apple pie that were left.", "OK, what I\u2019m saying is that you could\u2019ve been gracious and that you knew you brought a fancy pie your husband hadn\u2019t had any so you could\u2019ve taken a piece home for him. She hosted you right? She provided some food, yes?", "To be honest, even when  hosts suggest I take leftovers I never do.

I don\u2019t understand why you think you have no responsibility to be gracious.", "She should have just let it go but YTA.  It's weird to take back the leftover of what your brought for the hostess and guests to enjoy. \n\nYou have mentioned two unopened dips and a bottle of wine you brought a couple of times. You didn't bring those home, right?  What you brought was meant for the hostess but I'd just drop it and let it blow over at this point", "It was incredibly generous of you to share your $40 pie. NTA\n\nEven if she told you not to bring home leftovers, fuck that. You bought the pie, everyone at the party had a chance to eat it. As a host, it would be better to ask if anybody wants to take home leftovers, then let them, than to just offer it and get pissed when people can't read your mind and do what you said instead of what you wanted\n\nIf you really wanted to try something, get a piece reserved before telling people to pack the food up. I have no idea in what world it makes sense to get mad at people for a problem you caused yourself", "NTA. Super tacky. If she wanted some pie, she could've asked you where you got yours. Or maybe a friendly \"Hey, if you're up to it, that apple pie was a hit at Thanksgiving and I bet it would be great for Christmas as well!\"", "I\u2019m on the fence between E S H and N A H but neither seems right. \n\nI\u2019m most familiar with leave behind whatever you bring to share - except the host encouraged people to take leftovers \n\nI\u2019m also familiar with don\u2019t take the last of something - you might not have had dessert but I feel like it\u2019s an eat it there situation. Not take it to go. \n\nBut I think the host is the biggest A H for bringing it up after the fact. \n\nThe kind of friendship culture you have also comes into play. Do you eat dinner together often? \n\nAt my home, my best mates could take the first or last of something and it would be fine. Food, drinks, whatever. They can invite themselves over, they can bring nothing, or something. They get sent home with leftovers if there are some.", "If you're bring something, it shouldn't be anything small. It's for everyone to share. That was the mistake", "NTA with a dash of ESH. I would be so embarrassed if I was that host and was that vocal and upset about a piece of pie days later. \n\nThat being said also super dumb to get a dessert specifically for you and your husband because you don't like the other desserts, that is smaller and more expensive, and then expect to have the rest of it.\n\nWhy didn't you just leave it at home and eat it after? \ud83e\udd23", "esh. take some leftovers ususally doesn\u2019t make take the rest of what you brought, that\u2019s kinda rude. with that said it\u2019s equally rude to actually bring it up.", "NTA she should have asked for a slice before you left. She encouraged you to take leftovers", "NTA", "NTA. She told her guest to take the leftovers. If there was something she wanted to keep, she had opportunity to say \"leave me a piece of pie\".", "NTA -- She should have asked for you to leave a piece if she wanted some. Where are you that it is standard practice to bring basically an entire meal, but get chastised for taking home what is left? This sounds like a potluck situation, so you take home the leftovers, at least where I am. You brought a ham, two sides, a bottle of wine, 2 dips, and a dessert. I would not be going for Christmas.", "I was always taught that if you bring a food item to a gathering then you leave it there unless no one touches it, at which point you ask the host if they will use it later or if you should take it. It is your offering to the gathering, and the only reason to take it back is if they would end up throwing ot away.", "My response would be:\n\n\u201cI feel uncomfortable about this now. Maybe don\u2019t ask guests to bring leftovers home with no specifications if you are expecting certain leftovers to stay behind. I left two expensive dips and a bottle of wine, which I thought was generous. I definitely wasn\u2019t trying to stiff you.  If you want the apple pie left this time, just ask.
