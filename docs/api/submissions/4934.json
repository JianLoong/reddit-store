She had dessert there as well, it was a large pumpkin pie from Costco.   My husband and I aren\u2019t fans of pumpkin pie, so I figured I\u2019d bring the apple pie and we\u2019d eat that.   The apple pie was from a pricey bakery, really small, and cost $40.  Anyway, everyone was packing up leftovers (the host encouraged us to take leftovers) and my husband hadn\u2019t had dessert yet.   There were about two slices left of the apple pie and well over half the pumpkin pie left, so I took the rest of the apple pie with me.  This past week, the host invited us to Christmas dinner and said \u201cthis time, leave some dessert for me too because I didn\u2019t even get to try the apple pie.   I was really bummed you took it\u201d.    I explained that my husband and I don\u2019t eat pumpkin, and that he hadn\u2019t had any dessert yet.   I did leave two pricey dips we didn\u2019t even open ($10 each) for the host, and a bottle of wine.   I can tell she was annoyed I didn\u2019t leave any pie, but there was plenty of the dessert she bought (pumpkin pie) left.

Maybe I live somewhere different than everyone else but I have never considered or seen it considered tacky or rude to take home leftovers from items you brought to a meal.   I had a small family with little to no extended family. We\u2019ve spent numerous holidays celebrating with a variety of friends over the years and it was always standard to pack up what was left of what you brought and take it home. If there was a lot left, you could offer to leave some for your host and they would likely do the same with the items they prepared. But it wasn\u2019t a must and with a small amount no one would have batted an eye at taking it home. Especially since she also brought a host gift. \nThe exception would be if you made a dish specially for the host.

Part of the reason I don\u2019t think this is rude because people have different food preferences.   I brought food my family likes to eat, so when there is a lot of food left my preference is to take home the food I cooked because I know it\u2019s the food we will eat.   Perfect example is the dessert.   I brought apple pie because no one in my family likes pumpkin.

It's totality fine to make plates of leftovers if offered, but taking the *last* of something without asking the host is a bit of a dick move. \n\nAnd yeah you brought it, but I'd still bring it up before I boxed the last of it up. A fast \"I'm gonna grab the last of the pie if that's cool.\" would have at least given her the option to be gracious or say she wanted to save a piece for later.

Anyway, I may have left it, but if there was a ton of other pie.

As a host, it would be better to ask if anybody wants to take home leftovers, then let them, than to just offer it and get pissed when people can't read your mind and do what you said instead of what you wanted\n\nIf you really wanted to try something, get a piece reserved before telling people to pack the food up. I have no idea in what world it makes sense to get mad at people for a problem you caused yourself", "NTA. Super tacky. If she wanted some pie, she could've asked you where you got yours.

Not take it to go. \n\nBut I think the host is the biggest A H for bringing it up after the fact. \n\nThe kind of friendship culture you have also comes into play. Do you eat dinner together often? \n\nAt my home, my best mates could take the first or last of something and it would be fine. Food, drinks, whatever.

It's for everyone to share. That was the mistake", "NTA with a dash of ESH. I would be so embarrassed if I was that host and was that vocal and upset about a piece of pie days later. \n\nThat being said also super dumb to get a dessert specifically for you and your husband because you don't like the other desserts, that is smaller and more expensive, and then expect to have the rest of it.\n\nWhy didn't you just leave it at home and eat it after? \ud83e\udd23", "esh. take some leftovers ususally doesn\u2019t make take the rest of what you brought, that\u2019s kinda rude. with that said it\u2019s equally rude to actually bring it up.", "NTA she should have asked for a slice before you left.

If there was something she wanted to keep, she had opportunity to say \"leave me a piece of pie\".", "NTA -- She should have asked for you to leave a piece if she wanted some. Where are you that it is standard practice to bring basically an entire meal, but get chastised for taking home what is left? This sounds like a potluck situation, so you take home the leftovers, at least where I am. You brought a ham, two sides, a bottle of wine, 2 dips, and a dessert. I would not be going for Christmas.", "I was always taught that if you bring a food item to a gathering then you leave it there unless no one touches it, at which point you ask the host if they will use it later or if you should take it. It is your offering to the gathering, and the only reason to take it back is if they would end up throwing ot away.", "My response would be something like: \n\n\u201cI feel uncomfortable about this now. Maybe don\u2019t ask guests to bring leftovers home with no specifications if you are expecting certain leftovers to stay behind. I left two expensive dips and a bottle of wine, which I thought was generous. I definitely wasn\u2019t trying to stiff you.  I\u2019m glad you asked this time. I just wish it didn\u2019t come with a guilt trip that I don\u2019t think I deserve.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, I respond to passive aggression with frankness.

If you have a bone to pick with me, fucking tell me, like a grown up.

Reading your post I can clearly see that you only buy \"expensive\" items to show off socially, so I can understand wanting to eat as much of it as possible, specially since you wouldn't usually get the chance to do so. \n\nI'm not baiting you in any way, but people usually don't count the $ signs on every item that everyone brought. Unless they've spent more than they are used to.\n\nThat being said, just out of common curtesy, your husband hadn't had pie so you could have taken 1 slice and then you could have asked the room in general if anyone wanted the last slice or if you should take it.\n\nNext time, take something more in your budget so you don't spend the night calculating how much everyone spent compared to yourself.", "INFO- Why didn\u2019t your husband have any of the dessert you brought while he was there?", "NTA host is making it awkward now.

She's your friend, it's a pie. \n\nAdded: I don't see how the price of your pie & your dips is relevant here.", "YTA - etiquette would dictate that whilst there are leftovers, you do not take what you brought. You leave it for others. At best, in this scenario, you would take 1 of the 2 slices but even that\u2019s pushing it.", "My friend works at a luxury bakery and that\u2019s what their small pies and cake costs. The strange thing is, it doesn\u2019t taste any better. It\u2019s still just apple pie.", "Seems like that would have solved a lot.", "How do you shut it down when they say you\u2019re now making a big deal out of things? Asking for advice because I have a passive aggressive situation in my own life.", "Well, yeah. Once you bring a contribution to a meal like this, it no longer matters that you brought it with you. It\u2019s group food now. So taking the last of something is a faux pas and it looks slightly worse if it\u2019s the last of something you brought. This can be alleviated by saying \u201cdoes anyone else want any of the apple pie?\u201d", "They were told to take leftovers home. \n\nIt could just as easily have been solved by just taking a slice before they told people to pack up leftovers, why are we calling OP an asshole for following instructions?", "I put \u201cNTA.\u201d", "Once it's been contributed to the gathering then it doesn't matter who brought it, it's under the host's purview. You don't take back something once it's been offered to others. At least, that's how I was raised.", "And then your comment and replies are basically calling them tactless like they did something wrong, which they didn't?", "Thats not how I was raised, but regardless, \u201dthe host\u201d said to take leftovers if the host wanted a slice of the apple pie for later she should have set one aside before telling people to take leftovers.", "You are over dramaticizing my comment. I didn\u2019t say OP was tactless, I said she exhibited a lack of tact in that action. Because she did. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t rise to the level of AH, but she did commit a faux pas. Since that faux pas is why the host was grumpy, it bears pointing out. \n\nThe host was rude for bringing it up. The tactful way of expressing that would have been to say \u201cI really wish I could have tried your pie the other night, it looked so good! Where did you get it?\u201d", "Again, how is it a faux pas if the host told them to pack leftovers? You're seriously doing some mental gymnastics here, I'm not dramaticising anything \u2013 you just said what you said.", "No gymnastics - it\u2019s really simple: even when invited, you shouldn\u2019t take the last of something. Even if there\u2019s only one tiny serving left. If you want it, you should say: \u201cdoes anyone else want the rest of this?\u201d If no one says yes, it\u2019s yours. \n\nPerhaps the host would have replied \u201cohh yes can you leave me one slice, I didn\u2019t get the chance to try it but I really want to.\u201d Or the host would have said nothing, and then would not have been able to bring it up later because if she had, OP could have said \u201cI literally asked and no one else wanted some so I took it home.\u201d\n\nSo you see, this is why that rule of etiquette exists. Not taking the last of something without asking the group ensures that a) everyone who wants some has a chance and b) the person taking it can do so and be beyond reproach. \n\nI know what I said and I never called OP tactless. This is a matter of manners and etiquette - it\u2019s not that big a deal if you break one, nor is acknowledging that you did a proclamation on one\u2019s entire personality."]}
