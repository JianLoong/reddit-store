I was the first to say OP's nta, all I added was that she ought to take a step back to think on whether she's simply emotionally reacting or she truly has a personal problem with her, and that a polite and civil relationship would probably be in her own self interest, both in the short and the long term.", "The only area we disagree on is the value of the \u201cblood bond\u201d.
