First she just walks in? What is that? She should ask, and then should take it to another sink if the socks needed to be washed right away - bathroom or if you have a laundry room has a sink - then there. At the very least - ask and then if you let her use the kitchen sink, at least you have time to move items you want to have moved first.", "If someone did this in my home I would be irritated because of the sterilized items nearby.  That's the only reason I would be irritated.", "NTA. Sinks are sinks, but when you use a sink, you have to be aware of the general purpose of that sink and what is next to that sink. That's basic hygiene and food safety  measures. You don't wash poopy diapers in a sink right next to toothbrushes due to the poop spray that will happen. Likewise, you don't wash soiled or potentially infectious items in the kitchen sink right next to clean dishes or food. Again, the spray will contaminate the clean items. And you need to clean the sink after using it, especially for something soiled or potentially infectious. Dirty ass socks are potentially filled with foot fungus, germs etc that don't belong near food or  dishes or food prep items.\n\nNot only was what she did unhygienic, she was very disrespectful just waltzing in, not asking, and not cleaning up after herself.", "Umm, the bathroom sink?", "Did your husband do the cleaning afterwards until you were pleased? Was the home owned or bought by his parents before giving it to you? Probably still NTA even if both is true...", "NTA", "She\u2019s the AH for showing up unannounced, walking in without knocking, walking through your house with muddy shoes and washing her nasty socks next to the baby bottles. NTA op", "Info:  What is the interpersonal conflict?", "NTA - that's nasty.", "That seems like a pretty common use of a kitchen sink to me. That's where I wash vegetables that are covered in mud, and it's where I wash paint rollers that are covered in paint. I don't think mud from a sock is really any different from mud from a potato. And the kitchen sink is where I put laundry to soak if it needs stain removal treatment or whatever.\n\nTo me, your MIL's use of the kitchen sink is normal and expected. I'd expect any of my family members to feel free to make similar use of my kitchen sink if they were in my house.\n\nSo I'm voting a soft YTA. You're allowed to not want her to use your sink, but you're TA for your hyperbolic complaints about how this is obviously an unreasonable thing to do.", "I don't know if it's E S H or N A H. There is nothing wrong with washing things in the sink, and I feel that unless she was splashing dirty sock water on your clean things you slightly overreacted. But it also sounds like she isn't someone who communicates or behaves in a considerate way towards you. I think I have a lack of context as to the rest of your relationship to judge this one moment.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
