No matter how close you are, no and I mean NO ONE has a right to hold your child unless you want them to. Did they give birth to him? No. Did they go through 9 months of pain all so they can see is precious face? No. So she has absolutely no right to demand she hold her nephew.

She sounds far too demanding.", "Was this after the child was born, so the first time the aunt met your son, or sometime later?\n\nAfter a child is born it is pretty normal for loved ones like family and close friends to hold the baby when they meet the baby for the first time. If you refused to hand over the baby then, that would have been hurtful to her and an AH move, especially if you did hand the baby to other people. If the baby was fussy at the first meet, you could have put your son down for a nap and handed him to her after the nap when he would not be fussy.", "She has held him once.

It's weird to me that a tiny baby (which I assume means infant) being held by a family member would be considered so incredibly scarring (I'm not talking about kids who can crawl and roam on their own or older children being forced to hug/kiss family).  I'm guessing I was held by lots of people and cried.  My own baby sometimes cried whether I held him or if I put him down. Young babies also are used to mom and dad and meeting new people for the first time is rarely a smooth operation. Tiny babies...cry.

Making a child think they have to have contact with someone isn\u2019t good."]}
