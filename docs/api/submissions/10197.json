I'm guessing I was held by lots of people and cried.  My own baby sometimes cried whether I held him or if I put him down.

Be nice.\"  \"I get that Uncle John creeps you out, but just let him give you one big hug.  Be nice.\"  Being forced to \"be nice\" puts kids in a position where it's hard for them to speak up and speak out when an adult is doing something inappropriate because the creepy adult will accuse them of not being nice.\n\nYou're clearly applying the same rule to you and your partner (you don't hold him if he wants to be held by his mom and vice versa).  Stand your ground on this.  We spent decades teaching kids about \"Stranger Danger.\"  Sounds great, right?  Except statistics show most kids are molested by people they already know.
