You'd essentially be breaking up with her. So why not do that? \n\nPersonally I would sit her down and say, \"Relationships are a commitment and within that commitment is each side following through to support the partner and the other family members. You are not following through with your side of the agreement. You cannot decide who you do or do not clean up after just as I cannot decide who gets to eat dinner. It's cruel and unjust to allow a family to suffer. So I need you to take care of your end of the bargain so I don't get burned out holding up mine. If you don't think that's fair then we should seek other arrangements.\"\n\nIf she is going to continue to live with you then she needs to (a) get her benefits, (b) file for alimony/child support against her ex because he clearly is using it as a way to lord it over her, and (c) keep the home in order which means house is relatively clean and food is on the table. SAHM is a job with overtime and no breaks. It's harder than a regular job. \n\nChild support is 17% of the partners salary and 10% of that is given to you each month for the first child. Then it's more for each additional child. Since the ex did not formerly adopt the first child he doesn't need to pay support. It's possible he had struggled with the same issues as you and foresaw this as an issue which is why he never did it. \n\nI also recommend she seek therapy and possibly a psychiatrist.

I was exhausted  beyond reason. Maybe see if she needs help. \n\nShe: needs to file what she can. Get her divorce in order and on-paper support from her ex. Use her words to explain if she\u2019s too tired from wrangling children while growing one and ask for help. \n\nYou: need to decide if you\u2019re going to support her, as promised, or if you\u2019re going to break up with her.
