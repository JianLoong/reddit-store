Our son came early, a month and a half - we spent three weeks in the NICU and it was a very emotional time for me/us.\n\nFast forward and we are now home and getting used to everyday life with a baby. We have been getting visitors pretty often compared to what we\u2019re used to, and his parents come every couple of days. \n\nLately, I have had extreme anxiety when they come over because his mother has been incredibly overbearing to a point where I feel insulted. Each time they visit, she is constantly staring and analyzing how I am taking care of my child and making comments on what I \u201cshould\u201d be doing or what she would do. Mind you, my husband was born in the 80s and she has not taken care of a baby since. This came to a head the other night when she flipped out on me for sitting my child up to burp him. She for some reason believes you can\u2019t do that to a newborn, even though it\u2019s exactly how they showed us on the NICU. It would have been one thing if she actually had advice, but what she was saying made no sense and how she said it to me was incredibly rude and condescending. She also went on to comment on how he was dressed (not enough layers), how he was being fed (because he was drooling), and kept calling him by his middle name (see below).\n\nI\u2019m not a confrontational person, so when they left I asked my husband to talk to her re: her behavior. My husband also did not stick up for me as any of this was happening. This quickly spiraled into an argument, which yes is partly my fault because I was so heated about my MIL, and he told me that I\u2019m overreacting, constantly miserable around them and I should \u201cget over it\u201d. Now he is saying that he wants to move out and raise our child separately.\n\nI do want to add my husband and his parents are from a different country. They have lived in the US most of his life, but there are barriers at time culturally. Regardless, I\u2019d like to know if I\u2019m TA and overreacting - is this \u201cjust how I\u2019m laws are\u201d?\n\nLast add: while my husbands reaction is extreme, other things I \u201ccomplained\u201d to him about my in laws leading up to this: his mother telling me I gave birth \u201cthe easy way\u201d (emergency c-section), his father for some reason feeling comfortable grilling me about breastfeeding (I\u2019m not for multiple reasons), his mother texting me two days after giving birth asking me not to name our child the name we DID end up choosing bc she does not like it (now she refuses to call him by anything but his middle name), his parents questioning what I was doing that caused our son to come early..", "created_utc": 1698710363, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17k7mvl/aita_for_telling_my_husband_to_talk_to_his_mother/", "score": 20, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I know it's common to say this on here, but you don't have a mother-in-law problem, you have a husband problem. You're not over-reacting at all-if anything you're under reacting. Your husband wanting to leave and take your baby is really worrying-in your position I'd be getting myself legal advice. \n\nAnd you didn't give birth \"the easy way.\" You gave birth-if a baby came out of you, that's giving birth. Sections can be as difficult or as easy as vaginal deliveries to heal from physically, every birth and every birthing person has their own experience, so don't ever feel you need to justify how you did it or what your choices were, your choices are as valid as anybody else's.", "NTA and I'm guessing there are other things happening here if your husband escalated from this to a divorce.  That said, his parents sound awful and you're probably better off without him if this is how co-parenting with him will be.  Make sure to document all this so you can use it in the inevitable custody dispute.", "NTA\n\nNow he is saying that he wants to move out and raise our child separately. Sorry this was probably always the plan.\n\nDo not get a passport for your child. If he takes your baby you won't see it again.\n\nGet a lawyer and if possible move out ASAP go to your Mum's or any relative on your side of the family", "NTA - for the MIL topic but Im going to guess there\u2019s so much more happening here given that he is threatening to move out.", "Nta gtfo and divorce him", "Do things how the nurses and pediatrician have recommended.  My mom used to do this every single time we saw her when my girls were babies.  We ended up going extremely LC for this and a few other reasons.  MIL's seem to always think they know best and butt in when they haven't been asked their opinions.  Your husband seems to be a mommas boy for taking her side and now talking divorce.  Document EVERYTHING!!!  NTA", ">Now he is saying that he wants to move out and raise our child separately.\nI do want to add my husband and his parents are from a different country. \n\nNTA, and uh-oh. You might want to take that baby and retreat to your own family before they take him and vanish.", "NTA but your husband and his parents are, especially after seeing your edit. If your husband isn't sticking up for you, having your back, and his first reaction to this argument is divorce, that is telling that he doesn't respect you. Please get a plan in place to speak with a lawyer ASAP to see your options regarding divorce and custody. Also check about 'grandparents rights' in your state to make sure not a factor to worry about. Please heed the advice of not allowing your husband to get a passport for your child. If you can, move all important docs for both you and your baby (social cards, birth certificate) to a safety deposit box in your name only. \n\nFor now, set boundaries with your MIL directly about her and FIL visiting. I'd lock myself in a room separately with baby if they show up outside of the boundary, especially if your husband does move out. Good luck OP.", "NTA. I wonder if this is an abuse tactic.... You are at your most vulnerable, so he threatens to divorce you and take your baby away. His goal being that you will bow down to his parents and him, no matter how much any of them disrespects you.", "> Now he is saying that he wants to move out and raise our child separately.\n\nHe\u2019s going to take your child back to his home country and you\u2019ll never see him again. Do not get a passport for the baby and start planning your escape asap. You\u2019re NTA but there\u2019s bigger problems than this fight. You need to protect your son.", "Your husband is threatening to leave you rather than talking to his mom about blatantly disrespecting you. It should be very clear to you that his mom comes first. \n\nGiven that he's from a different country, I'd talk to a lawyer ASAP..", "The fact your husband now wants to move out I'm sure you have other problems in your marriage outside of your MIL.  But since you're focus on this problem the good thing is that it'll be over soon.  I doubt you MIL will visit when you and her son are separated.", "This.\n\nOP, if he genuinely believes he wants to move out and raise the child on his own, you need to talk to an attorney immediately. As in, call an attorney tomorrow to determine how best to protect your custodial rights.\n\nIf this was just him being malicious then I'd take a step back and tell him that you would like to pursue couples counseling.\n\nIf your parents live in your state I'd 100% move with the baby there. If there is ANY chance he could leave the country with the baby, let the attorney know that immediately and let them know that you want him only to have supervised visitation under court order until everything is resolved with the courts.", "I agree. Sadly.. I think you picked poorly and you should consult with an attorney about what your options are. Your husband should be in your corner.. I think this will end up being a larger issue."]}
