I know it's common to say this on here, but you don't have a mother-in-law problem, you have a husband problem. You're not over-reacting at all-if anything you're under reacting. Your husband wanting to leave and take your baby is really worrying-in your position I'd be getting myself legal advice. \n\nAnd you didn't give birth \"the easy way.\" You gave birth-if a baby came out of you, that's giving birth.

That said, his parents sound awful and you're probably better off without him if this is how co-parenting with him will be.  Make sure to document all this so you can use it in the inevitable custody dispute.", "NTA\n\nNow he is saying that he wants to move out and raise our child separately.

Also check about 'grandparents rights' in your state to make sure not a factor to worry about. Please heed the advice of not allowing your husband to get a passport for your child. If you can, move all important docs for both you and your baby (social cards, birth certificate) to a safety deposit box in your name only. \n\nFor now, set boundaries with your MIL directly about her and FIL visiting. I'd lock myself in a room separately with baby if they show up outside of the boundary, especially if your husband does move out. Good luck OP.", "NTA. I wonder if this is an abuse tactic....

Thing change so much over the years and can change quickly too. For example I had my kids in 89,91 & 95. The practice for umbilical cord care was like this for the 89 baby we were to wipe the cord with rubbing alcohol every diaper change and bath. For the one born in 91, we were to only use the alcohol 4 times a day. For my last one in 95 it was down to once a day. Now the practice is not being done(I know because I am an OB/pediatrics RN). Or direct her the American Academy of Pediatrics or the World Health Organization\u2019s web sites, they Hebe the most updated care.", "NTA \nHis extreme reaction is very telling.

Do you really want to be with this guy? \n\nI agree with someone below when they said - do not get a passport for baby and I will add, do not leave hubby alone with baby because there is a good chance they will do a runner - hubby and MIL with baby.

Your FIL should not be criticising how you feed your child, and he most likely agrees with MIL as it doesn't sound like he's intervened. Your husband is also the asshole here. He should have stood up for you to his mother without hesitation. Does he help with the baby as well? My guess is no/not as much as you do, and if he does, does his mother criticise \\*him\\* then?

SPECIALLY our parents, we are taught to not talk back even if what they say is unreasonable and dosent make sense. Be very careful with your baby and try to always stay one step ahead your husband. but try to talk to him aswell. try to tell him that you understand how he feels if he doesn\u2019t want to be rude to his parents but but his mothers words truly hurt you deeply. im sure as your husband he cares about your emotions if he really sees that it\u2019s genuine and not out of petty.", "If your husband is an 80s baby, he is too old to be such a mama\u2019s boy.

OP never mentions anything else about his nationality so this is just a lot of vaguely racial daydreaming.\n\nIf OP said they were both American born from upstate New York and her husband mentioned wanting to move out and co-parent you would certainly not assume their intention was to kidnap the baby.

When you\u2019re not busy raising his child the way they want you to raise him, you\u2019ll get to work as an unpaid maid, cook, and chauffeur, while providing your husband with whatever he requires to alleviate the stress he will undoubtedly be said to be under from working so hard to provide for you. (BTW, you\u2019ll do all of that wrong, too. Both the stuff they can see/experience like the cooking and cleaning, and the \u201cstress relief\u201d - of whatever kind -, if he deems it inadequate.)\n\n2) Figure out how you are going to leave him and fight for your child; then do it.\n\nChoosing the second option is going to be harder in the short term, but you are going to be in for a lifetime of misery if you choose option one. I\u2019d suggest that, whatever you do right now, you start documenting everything, because eventually it\u2019s all going to come to a head. With luck, it\u2019ll happen before you add any *more* children to the mix, but it\u2019s going to happen.

It wasn\u2019t a choice, unfortunately.

I did tell him I have felt unhappy and that I thought after how he took care of me in the hospital (again, he was very good to me) that things would change. When I said I was miserable in this relationship, that is when he said me too and that maybe we should sell the house, split costs and go our separate ways. I don\u2019t currently feel as though he is plotting to take my child to another country, although me being an extremely anxious person it has crossed my mind as I\u2019ve read horror stories about that type of situation.
