I'm so good I have trained people, been a trainer, and have won so many awards for customer service.  When I had to send off supervisor calls still, most were because the customer wanted to compliment my work.  There's only one issue, a lot of men seem to think I have a gorgeous voice and because of that I am often flirted with.  When I worked for a bank, it happened so often I started telling the customers I was married when they would ask.  I would never offer this, but definitely would say 'Yeah I'm married' when they asked.  It became nearly automatic now and usually seems to end all flirting.  I did try telling a guy I was in a relationship (I was at the time and am in a new relationship), but that did not seem to be enough to keep the flirting from happening.  \n\n\nA coworker was asking what they should do when this happens to them and I let them know what I do and another coworker overheard us and said I was lying to customers and it was a jerk move.

You are protecting yourself from unwanted advances in a totally bland way that saves face for everyone involved. If you were lying about the banks products that would be bad, but lying about being married to shut down idiots is 100% fine.

If you don\u2019t want unwanted flirting, lie if you have to", "NTA, unless you are working for a hotline service which offers a different service offering, your customers doesn't need to know your marital status neither do you have to encourage that sort of questions. Just be professional and if stating what you state gets them to move on, there's nothing wrong with it.", "NTA. I used to do the same thing. It's an easy way to shut down unwanted attention without hurting anyone's feelings or feeling too awkward most of the time. Honestly,  people shouldn't be hitting on you at work anyway.", "NTA\n\nTrust me, when I worked customer service, half the time my telling the customer that I hope they have a great day was a flat out lie.  \n\nHell, the foundation of customer service is theater to begin with.    \n\n\nYour coworker is just weird.", "NTA. Get a cheap engagement ring and/or wedding band from Etsy and wear it while at work. If you\u2019re as good at customer service as you say you are, then a little non-verbal boundary may get the message across that you\u2019re not interested in being chatted up. Your co-worker on the other hand is the AH for essentially supporting your own going harassment by customers for what I can only assume is the\u2026 sanctity of marriage? \n\nFor some reason a lot of men only really seem to respect women when they appear to be the property of another man.", "NTA\nYou\u2019re working, and it is your personal business.

You do not owe any details of your personal life to your customers, and the expectation of complete honesty on that front is unrealistic. Saying \"I am married\" communicates the message that you are unavailable, is short and seems to work. Possibly in an ideal world, saying \"I am in a relationship\" or \"I do not discuss details about my personal life\" would be enough, but if that does not seem to work, and you have found something that does, good for you.", "Nta.", "NTA.

Further more if you\u2019re a woman dealing with men the sad reality is some men just won\u2019t quit and it could even be dangerous to let some men know that you aren\u2019t in fact married. No one is hurt by your lie and you remain safer.", "NTA - I once did something similar with a particular customer when they tried not asking me out. Not only did I pretend to a partner who did not exist, I also claimed to be of a differing sexual orientation so that the customer couldn't use the old \"well in case you ever break up with them\" tactic.", "NTA.

It\u2019s not a time you\u2019re supposed to be flirting with customer service. Sure if the opportunity presents itself organically sure but if you get shut down move on. Afterwards it just becomes harassment and even then if you really want to break it down it\u2019s harassment from the get go. So no you\u2019re NTA for saying you\u2019re married regardless if it\u2019s a lie or not. You\u2019re shutting down unprofessional behavior and the lies isn\u2019t hurting anybody. The coworker sounds jealous.

This assumption that it\u2019s her job to be honest about something about her personal life that she does not have to share.
