When I worked for a bank, it happened so often I started telling the customers I was married when they would ask.  I would never offer this, but definitely would say 'Yeah I'm married' when they asked.  It became nearly automatic now and usually seems to end all flirting.  I did try telling a guy I was in a relationship (I was at the time and am in a new relationship), but that did not seem to be enough to keep the flirting from happening.  \n\n\nA coworker was asking what they should do when this happens to them and I let them know what I do and another coworker overheard us and said I was lying to customers and it was a jerk move.

You are protecting yourself from unwanted advances in a totally bland way that saves face for everyone involved. If you were lying about the banks products that would be bad, but lying about being married to shut down idiots is 100% fine.

If you don\u2019t want unwanted flirting, lie if you have to", "NTA, unless you are working for a hotline service which offers a different service offering, your customers doesn't need to know your marital status neither do you have to encourage that sort of questions. Just be professional and if stating what you state gets them to move on, there's nothing wrong with it.", "NTA. I used to do the same thing. It's an easy way to shut down unwanted attention without hurting anyone's feelings or feeling too awkward most of the time. Honestly,  people shouldn't be hitting on you at work anyway.", "NTA\n\nTrust me, when I worked customer service, half the time my telling the customer that I hope they have a great day was a flat out lie.  \n\nHell, the foundation of customer service is theater to begin with.    \n\n\nYour coworker is just weird.", "NTA. Get a cheap engagement ring and/or wedding band from Etsy and wear it while at work.

You do not owe any details of your personal life to your customers, and the expectation of complete honesty on that front is unrealistic. Saying \"I am married\" communicates the message that you are unavailable, is short and seems to work.

It\u2019s not a time you\u2019re supposed to be flirting with customer service. Sure if the opportunity presents itself organically sure but if you get shut down move on. Afterwards it just becomes harassment and even then if you really want to break it down it\u2019s harassment from the get go. So no you\u2019re NTA for saying you\u2019re married regardless if it\u2019s a lie or not. You\u2019re shutting down unprofessional behavior and the lies isn\u2019t hurting anybody.
