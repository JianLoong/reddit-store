I will never understand why someone has to lie about it to be left alone, and even sometimes that doesn\u2019t stop them.", "NTA lie to customers, I do it all the time. It literally doesn't matter. Your life is none of their business and frankly I'd find it ruder and more awkward to have to come straight out and say no ur a creep I'm not interested.", "NTA, anyone who asks out someone they\u2019re paying to speak to is the problem.", "NTA. When I\u2019m hit on I pretty much always say I have a boyfriend, even when it\u2019s not true. It makes me uncomfortable to be hit on by strangers if that\u2019s not something I\u2019m aiming to happen and usually is an unwanted interruption when I\u2019m just trying to catch up with a friend over a drink or something. But especially at work, I have older men hit on me often and it usually shuts them down. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to shut it down like that to people in order to get your job done in a more comfortable way.", "NTA. People should not be flirting with people who work in customer service. We\u2019re nice because it\u2019s part of our job, not because we like you.", "Absolutely NTA. I\u2019ve been in customer service for a long time and wear a ring for similar reasons. Not only is turning people down incredibly awkward and not something you should have to do at work to begin with, but I\u2019ve seen both male and female coworkers be hit on and unable to escape without appearing rude, and it has stressed some of them out to the point of tears. You don\u2019t owe customers any factual knowledge of your personal life that isn\u2019t relevant to your job, but you absolutely have every right to protect yourself from being harassed.", "NTA- I often have to review customer communications with CS. If they try to flirt with the CS agent I close their account, because literally 0% of our staff are employed as sex line workers so they have not consented to putting up with that crap at work. I might be reading the communications because of a legitimate product fault, but if they come in creepy they go out no longer a customer (albeit with the refund if shit actually broke).", "My mother always had this problem too, doing B2B sales on the phone. \n\nNTA", "NTA. This plane s3xual harassment", "Nta at all and my partner does the same. A lot men confuse politeness for interest", "NTA. Horrible creeps hitting on you at work has got to be the worst. The real AHs here is all those creeps.", "I have \\*recommended\\* that my staff do this. And I have 30 years in customer service, complaints and helpdesk roles: NTA. Of course it's OK. It's Anti-Stalker-101. It also saves time, effort and prevents embarrassment. \n\nCustomers deserve politeness, and honest information about your job. They have ZERO right to any personal information. I have clients who don't even get my name because they are toxic.\n\nI bet the upset co-worker is a dude. Blokes who have been turned-down recently, or who have very small - - - opinions of themselves, think there is a vast plot amongst women. I'm not sure what the point of the plot is, but it conveniently means some dudes never examine themselves.\n\nNot your fault he's a loser.", "NTA\nIf you aren\u2019t interested for whatever reason then lie.

You're not lying about anything important regarding to them.", "god no you'll never be ta for this situation. its not your fault those men wont back off", "WTF?  Because your marital status is important to the job you\u2019re doing?  Tell you coworker to gtfo.\n\nNTA in case it\u2019s not obvious.", "NTA. You go to work to earn money to live and many customers do not understand that. If you say you are 'in a relationship' or similar there are plenty of people (not just blokes) that will think you are just playing hard to get and that they should pursue you further. If you say you are married - even if you are not - it almost always tends to stop unwanted advances dead in the water.\n\nYes, it may be lying but to protect yourself sometimes it is necessary.", ">Whoever called that a jerk move is\n\nA man.", "He is probably legit thinking customers stay longer and spend more when they think they have a shot at their waiter's.", "Flirting or asking someone out is not crossing any line, Covid really messed people up it seems", "So do women, what is your point?
