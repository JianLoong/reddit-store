I'm going to assume the one asking for advice was a woman and the one that got butt hurt was a dude?", "Some men assume when a woman is nice to them, even if her JOB is to be nice to them, that she is interested in them. When I worked at a bank I wore an engagement ring (although I wasn\u2019t engaged) to stop customers from trying to pick me up.", "Obviously NTA  \n\n\nYou shouldn't be flirting with people who are paid to listen to you. They don't need to know your personal business. Say whatever you like.", "I wore a fake wedding band as well. It did not stop everyone, but it slowed things down.", "Yeeep. Worked at a takeaway joint across from the pokies / pub and always had the drinks come in on a late night. One guy told me he wanted to take me home to his son even after I said I had a boyfriend. \n\nIf the married line works, keep it.", "NTA, and might I say it sucks that still, in this day and age, that men will not back off if a woman says \"no\", but will back off if they find out that that same woman \"belongs\" to another man.", "This! \u261d\ud83c\udffb\n\nYour coworker is the jerk. How about customers not crossing a line to begin with, and certainly when they don't stop when you politely ask them to?", "Sad to say that ignoring them does not always work.

They know we can't walk away and we're a captive audience. And some places have rules against giving your number to customers. I was working in a fast food place when I was like 20 or something and this really cute guy asked for my number after I gave him his stuff, and I wanted to, but it was against company policy to give our numbers out for safety reasons, I guess.", "My first thought also, was this was a man with entitlement issues.", "It doesn't really matter, no matter the gender - the coworker was wrong - but it completes a better better picture for us, the readers, about *why* the coworker said this.\n\nI guess it helps those of us who can't wrap our heads around anyone saying this, but understand human how humans tend to respond based on their differing lives, to well.... Wrap our heads around it?\n\nFor example: I'm AFAB and enby. I would never say this in a million years, but there are AFAB cis people who would (very few trans or enby people would, but there is some differences). CIS men? Yeah, a lot could think this way, because they've never *needed* to protect themselves like this.", "Probably offended at OP having caused him to wonder how many women are doing things like this to put *him* off.
