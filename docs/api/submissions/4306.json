During my last delivery the only support my husband (M29) was able to give was to sit in a chair behind my bed, because he faints at the sight of blood. This was three and a half years ago, pre-covid, so I was able to have three other support persons (my mom, his mom, my best friend) in the room with me, so him sitting behind me honestly didn't bother me one bit. Now, when I say that he faints at the sight of blood I really mean it; this man fainted cutting our son's umbilical cord. \n\nFast forward to preparing for my current delivery, and I can only have one support person in the delivery room due to COVID/flu restrictions. I am really wanting someone that's going to be an actual support person; someone that can hold my leg, coach me through labor, cut the umbilical cord, etc. I also hemorrhaged after my last delivery, so it's really important to me to have someone that can be with me through everything, not just cheering me on from behind me.  I understand that he wants to be in the delivery room because it is his child, but I am absolutely terrified of having to go through everything by myself. I've decided that either my mom or best friend should be the one in the delivery room with me, but my husband is really really upset with that decision, to the point where now he doesn't even want to go to the hospital with me when I go into labor; he says that he'll drop me off and then show up after the baby is born even though my doctor said he could be in the waiting area. I don't want him to be upset with me for making this decision, but I also really need/want to feel supported. So that leads me to ask: AITA for not wanting to have him in the delivery room with me?", "created_utc": 1670547902, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zgi9en/aita_for_not_wanting_my_husband_in_the_delivery/", "score": 319, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your husband is essentially another patient in the hospital if he faints that easily at the sight of blood. He of all people should understand why you are making this decision. \n\nIt\u2019s a shame that he\u2019s so susceptible to fainting, as that\u2019s not his fault either\u2026but he\u2019s gotta be realistic. You need someone who can be there with you and help you through the grueling task of childbirth, not someone peeking from between their fingers at the back of the room in a chair. The doctors and nurses in the room don\u2019t need to have to *also* keep an eye on your husband. \n\nThere is no reason he can\u2019t be close by in the waiting room and meet his child afterwards. Since you are the one having the kid, it\u2019s 100% your call. If he chooses to be a big vindictive baby about it, that says a lot about him.", "I would ask your husband, \u201cWhy do you think I want/need someone in the room with me?\u201d\n\nIf he says \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d then he has no business being there in the first place.\n\nBut likely, he\u2019ll admit that you need emotional and physical support. At which point I would say, \u201cIf you can\u2019t provide that for me, as the one person in the room who\u2019s supposed to support me, then why would I choose you to be there? Only to be unconscious and basically inaccessible during childbirth?\u201d\n\nHonestly this sounds like the tip of the iceberg for this guy and if he\u2019s the type of asshole that takes revenge on a pregnant woman\u2019s wishes for her childbirth by telling you to deal with it by yourself and reduces himself to your Uber driver on that day,  then to me he doesn\u2019t sound like a very supportive partner all around.\n\nI would tell him to drop you off at the hospital and not come back, but that\u2019s just me.", "NTA. Keep explaining to him what you need. Remind him how he passed out cutting the cord. He cannot help you properly. Tell him it would mean a lot for him to be waiting in the waiting room. He can come in right after it's done.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re being forced into this difficult decision, but the person squeezing the human out of their body is the person who gets to make those choices. Your husband needs to get over himself. This isn\u2019t about him.", "NTA. You need support, unfortunately your husband isn't capable of giving it to you. Now hand the phone to your husband because this next part is for him.\n\nYou're the father, and that's super important, but this isn't your medical procedure. This is about your wife. She needs someone there who can support her, who can cheer her on, who can focus on what she needs, who can whisper encouragement, who can physically support her. It's not your fault that you faint at the sight of blood, but *her needs matter more than your wants right now.* The best way you can step up for your wife right now is to let her have the support she needs in the delivery room while you support her from a safe place where you're not going to become a medical problem when you pass out and hit your head on something. It's your job to put your wife and child first, even when that means you have to do things in a way that you don't really like.", "Directly ask your husband how he plans on supporting you since he can\u2019t handle blood\u2026what\u2019s his plan? If you\u2019re stressed it will affect your health and the babies. He\u2019s too busy focused on his hurt feelings.", "NTA. I almost went with N A H, because I understand dad wanting to be there when baby is born, but he seems to be throwing a bit of a fit and thinking of himself first, rather than the two people who are going through an extreme event. You and baby need to be first, and that means having a support person who can be there for both of you.", "NTA. Your husband is selfish. \n\nLabour is hard, and if he can't support you through it, he should abstain from being there.", "NTA - whatever your husband wants, he has proven he cannot do what you need him to, so he needs to get over his damn self and let you have the support you need.  You are the one having this baby and frankly that's all that matters, not his freaking ego.", "NTA. You are absolutely right you need someone there who will not faint just when things are getting difficult for you. He's being selfish and childish to now say he won't even show up to the hospital I mean come on. Congrats on your baby and good luck with the delivery.", "NTA.\n\nHe's being immature and self centered. If he can't handle blood, he should definitely be outside waiting.", "NTA. He\u2019s doing NO WORK to bring this kid into the world. This is all on you, your medical staff and your support person. He can\u2019t provide support. \n\nHe\u2019s an asshole for acting like a stroppy child.", "NTA. It seems like he's interpreting your decision as \"punishment\" rather than as a natural consequence of his own medical condition (hemophobia). It may be that he feels ashamed and he's responding with anger and resentment. \n\nWhat's most important for you on that day is to feel safe and supported. It's going to be hard to focus on all the complexities of bringing another human into this world if your attention is divided because your husband is passed out on the floor. It sucks feeling helpless to help the person you love the most; maybe try reinforcing that the best way he can help is by avoiding that risk to his safety, that you do need him close and to be strong for you, and that his choice not to be present in the waiting room would be extremely hurtful and lonely for you.", "NAH, I'd be bummed to if I couldn't be in the room. Being in the waiting room isn't much of a consolation prize either. But ultimately he should realize that his job that day is making you comfortable so your baby's birth is successful. It may be that you just need to give him a minute to calm down and put it in perspective. The day isn't about him, it is about the health of you and your baby.\nIs there an alternative hospital which allows a 2nd person? Our Dr did deliveries at 2 or 3 hospitals and we were able to pick one...", "INFO: why cant he be with you before the actual delivery happens? Maybe I don\u2019t know enough about childbirth but there isnt blood before you actually start to push right? Was it his choice to be behind your bed the entire time?", "Can you have a doula in addition to your husband or will the hospital work with you at all on support people?", "I want to go with NAH, but his reaction of not even wanting to wait makes him a soft AH. \n\nHe can't handle blood, you need someone that can, honestly if my husband was the same way I would have had my sister with me instead of him for my 2nd.", "NAH\n\nYou deserve to feel fully supported during delivery. He's also not wrong for feeling the way he does, as obviously if he had a choice he wouldn't faint at the sight of blood and therefore be able to be there for the birth of his child. \n\nMy daughter's father is like that and he sat next to me, but facing my head. He got me ice chips and cold cloths, held my hand, massaged my shoulders etc. He just avoided \"ground zero\" and focused on me. We had a plan that if he couldn't cut the umbilical cord then I would. He was able to, though. \n\n Congratulations on babe! Blessings \ud83d\udc9a", "NAH. I understand why actual support is so important to you during birth, it\u2019s scary as hell. But you can\u2019t fault him for being upset that you\u2019re deciding he can\u2019t be there when his child is born. He doesn\u2019t have a \u201cright\u201d to be there, but it\u2019s definitely understandable he\u2019s not happy about it. This is a horrible situation for the both of you, and no one here is an AH for having their respective feelings.", "NTA- I had a midwife for part of my prenatal care and asked her about husbands who fainted. She said they sometimes have to just let them fall if there isn't any extra person in the room. Then if they hit their head they become a patient as well. So at a time when you need everyone to be looking over you and baby, now people need to pay attention to this other person who just passed out. Have your mom there. Let her be there for her baby.", "NTA\nHe needs to understand you need a coach, not someone who will pass out. No shame, having worked in medical for nearly 10yrs, many men get queasy/faint at sight of blood. I would encourage him to understand that you can only have one person in there & since he\u2019s not super stable w/blood, you want him nearby to come in immediately after but need someone who can help you during the process. Maybe have him with you right up till delivery then swap out for your mom or best friend for the gory parts. I can understand how he would be hurt by being disincluded, but maybe point out the logic of it and stress that he will be there right up til the delivery & then can come right back in when that part is over \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I'm honestly on the fence with this one, I absolutely hate the way you put this into words, you really make your husband out to be useless, what a kick to the gonads, I mean seriously, the way you worded that, the only support he was able to give you last time was sitting behind you, like damn just him being in the room trying his hardest to be the best support he can be for you knowing that he can and probably will faint, but that just wasn't enough, I feel bad for the guy, bless him he is trying a second time and I totally get his reaction because he is getting kicked in the gonads again, poor fella can't win, He isn't the AH in this, won't flat out say you are TA but I will say the situation sucks, I will go with NAH, but perhaps try putting yourself in his shoes, I'm sure he knows and feels that he isn't good enough to be your so called support, but bless him he tries and that would be support enough for me", "NTA at all!!!!  His purpose in the delivery room is to support you, not spectate from distance so that he doesn't faint.  He's not cut our for the job, this isn't about him.", "NTA \n\nHave someone there that can be supportive.", "NTA however if you need a support person you could hire a midwife to be there as you described and then you would still be allowed to have your husband at the bedside. You are taking away a special moment for him even if he is not equip to handle it well. Maybe something to consider if he is genuinely upset about not being there for the birth.", "NTA you get to choose who is in the room", "NTA. He\u2019s in a snit because he can\u2019t honor your needs at your most vulnerable time? I get his disappointment, but he sounds like a liability in the delivery room, and he\u2019s not considering your welfare, which is paramount in this situation. I hope he can begin to empathize with you. This would be a borderline dealbreaker for me", "I seem to be in the minority here, but I couldn't imagine having not having my husband there, despite him not good with the medical stuff.

You expect him to sit in the waiting room, not being able to see you/talk to you?\n\n\nI feel like those hours leading up to everything was when I most needed the most important person in the world to me.\n\n\nAlso, you have an older child. You expect your husband to just sit in the waiting room....so he won't be with you and he won't be with your other kid all day?", "NAH\n\nI mean if he's not allowed in the room who cares if he's not at the hospital?", "NTA \n\nCan your mom or friend be there as backup? Your husband can give it a try to support you and if he feels faint he switch with your mom/friend? \n\nAt least this way he got a chance and if he can\u2019t do it someone else can take his place", "ESH, it does seem rather cold to exclude him. You do know they have nurses right? I get where you're coming from but you need to be prepared that this could seriously affect your marriage.", "NTA. Your need for support is real, the support is important, and he genuinely cannot provide it for you. I can understand why he's upset, but him being unhappy does not mean you are being an asshole.", "NTA. Birth can absolutely be a traumatic experience. Even best case scenario, it's incredibly hard. You deserve to have someone in the room who can support you through it. Does it suck that you're limited to one person? Yes, absolutely. But because you are limited to one person, and because you **need someone who can actually help you the whole time**, you need to choose someone who will be there for you.\n\nAsk your husband - if you faint, and I wind up needing someone to fight with the doctors for MY care (which absolutely happens), I will be out of luck won't I? You need someone there to advocate for you, and unfortunately your husband is not in a position to provide that.", "nta\n\nand if you've made it clear to him that you really, really need support while you literally deliver a baby (omg questioning if he even understands the weight of that) then he should want that for you! showing even LESS support by not going at all is just \ud83d\ude10 I have no words for that", "NTA \n\nhusbands little fit seems like a way to get back at you for not having him there.

If he\u2019s that incapable, then tbh I have no idea how he\u2019s gotten this far in life? I think he should talk to a therapist about this because with kids it\u2019s bound to happen", "Your husband should be able to do everything you listed without seeing blood apart from cutting the umbilical cord.

But having told him how useless he is to you why are you upset he will come back when he can be of use!", "I don\u2019t get why he would even want to be there. He was literally doing nothing to help his wife and peony couldn\u2019t even see the baby until it\u2019s cleaned off. There is no reason for him to be there and deprive his wife of an actual support person.", "And i would start by getting some bloody (I know it\u2019s not blood) steaks from the butcher and and open the package in front of him. And if he cannot have a conversation while looking at those, then he cannot do anything to help. NTA op and honestly, this is grounds for separation on my book.", "True but why is he required to wait at the hospital? Either way he\u2019s missing the birth so why not from the comfort of your own home?", "Exactly, why does it make a difference where he waits? either way he\u2019ll miss the birth of their child", "It's not selfish to feel upset. It is selfish to throw your toys out of the pram and declare that you won't bother coming into the hospital at all.\n\nHe cannot support her (or at least hasn't expressed any intention to get over his phobia and try) and he's acting like being in the delivery room is actually a golden ticket of privilege and not the support role that she needs.", "He would be selfish if he couldn't appreciate that his wife needs actual support through the birth and he simply can't provide it. He wants to be there but is incapable of helping and supporting his wife so he needs to let her take someone who will support her without being petulant about it.\n\nIt's got to be traumatising going through labour and childbirth with someone who is so useless that they may as well not be there at all. \n\nHe wants to be there because he wants to be there. He's thinking of himself, not his wife. That's selfish in my book.", "I find your username ironic given the topic at hand lol", "I don\u2019t know if you have ever been in a birthing room, but blood can get everywhere. I had a pretty routine birthing experience and I was  shocked when I got up to leave the birthing suite at the amount of blood. And it\u2019s not just below the waist. The blood pools all on the floor, on the sheets, etc. It doesn\u2019t stay nice and tidy at the foot of the bed.", "Honestly they are just so meddlesome", "If something went wrong and they needed him they\u2019d let him in. His wife is literally risking her life to have a baby for the both of him. If he can\u2019t suck it up enough to wait nearby and play games on his phone while she literally rips her own body apart then he is not much of a partner.", "NTA\n\nYou need someone you can depend on; you can't depend on him for this. It's time to sit him down and ask him if he really thinks he could provide x, y, and z for you while you're in labor, and if the answer is no, he needs to be dependable in some other form and think about your needs while you're going to be pushing out a human being and at a huge medical risk over his hurt feelings. People DIE having babies. BABIES die in labor. But no, he's going to go home and sulk because he's incapable of being supportive of you while in a medical situation because he faints at the sight of blood. While he can't necessarily help it, it doesn't mean you should suffer having someone both useless to you and a risk to the hospital in there with you.", "NTA\u2026.the only thing I can think of is maybe sit down with your doctor and explain the situation with them. Ask if at your next appt you both can explain the situation where your husband faints when he sees blood. Ask the doctor what they would recommend  of there could possibly be an exception/if something can be done to allow him and another person there or what the doc thinks the best answer is. Explain IN FROMT OF THE DOCTOR that you want your husband to be there for the birth but that you also need a support person who can help you with delivery. Have the doc go through the list of things a support person would have to do and have them ask your husband if he is able to do those things? Then let the doctor give their medical opinion.", "NTA. You need to be focused on getting your baby safely delivered and not worried about him fainting. His fainting is nothing to be ashamed of but this is not the time or place. He can come in as soon as it's all over but you need someone who isn't going to hit the deck.", "NTA. Your husband has had 3 years to work on this phobia so that he can be there for you while you give birth to your child.  He has chosen not to. \n\nYou are giving birth. You deserve to have someone there who can actively support you. He needs to put down his ego and start thinking of his family.", "NTA\n\nDuring labour, you need those around you to help and support you.\n\nIf you're stressed and worried about him fainting, it could affect you, your baby, and your labour.\n\nIf you had to go for a c section, could he handle being in the room watching what is happening?\n\nIf he can't be your support, he needs to realise that making sure you have someone to support you during labour is more important than him sitting behind you or him fainting when you need support the most.\n\nQuestion: Can he handle raw meat preparation?\nOr does looking at, for example, raw bloody steaks make him queasy or faint?\nIt may be an idea that if he can handle things like that, you may reconsider after checking with the hospital if you can switch support people during labour if it gets to much for him so that if you want him there he can be with you part way through labour if he is going to genuinely provide support you need and have him step out and your mom take his place when it gets towards the end of the labour process.", "NTA. Delivery is HARD and you need support in the room, not another patient. He\u2019s being petty AF and making your delivery all about him by treating you this way. Just tell him that he can be in there, but he needs to watch videos of live births ahead of time without fainting beforehand to prove to you he can stay on his feet, participate in supporting you, and not just leave you to suffer alone.", "Focus on the safety of the baby in your discussions.  A stressed laboring mother drastically increases the danger to the life of the baby.\n\nAs responsible parents you both have to make sacrifices for what is best for the baby.\n\nNta", "Hire a doula who can support you. A doula and a support person are both allowed in the room. Your husband can sit in the chair and the doula can help through the birth.", "NTA", "I\u2019m wondering if there is another solution here. Could the husband not be positioned in a way that he has to see blood? If he is facing towards your face, turned away from your crotch, would that work? That\u2019s how my husband was positioned, right by my head holding my hand, he didn\u2019t have to look between my legs if he didn\u2019t want to. And you could cut the cord yourself. Maybe the nurses could also put up a screen down there, similar to what they use for C sections, to shield the view of the site?", "NTA, my mum was there for my sister because my BIL was the same. Foolishly the hospital staff invited him in before they'd mopped the blood off the floor though!\n\nMy husband, however, watched my C-section, absolutely fascinated.", "NTA. He'd even be a risk as he could fall and hit is head, thus making things more complicated for everyone, including staff. You already know he WILL faint and won't be able to see his child until after everything is done and cleaned up. Of course he's right in his wish but he should also see that he is of no support for you, not his fault, but you deserve someone there to be really with you and supporting you.\nHe can see his child afterwards or not? I know, he will feel like he missed it but he will anyways due to fainting so there's no point there. Pre-Covid, sure, let him come. Now... no, sorry.", "NTA your needs > his wants\n\nHe couldn\u2019t support you last time. If he\u2019s going to faint again, he\u2019s missing out on the baby being born anyway. And his little tantrum of not wanting to be at the hospital while you\u2019re in a life-threatening situation is telling. He only wants to be \u201chelpful\u201d to his spouse and child when it benefits him. Husband and father of the year right there.", "More than anything else, she needs someone there who can be an effective advocate for her if things start to go badly, like another hemorrhage. And the husband just isn\u2019t capable of doing that.", ">we contribute according to our capabilities\n\nThis is going to be my new mantra.  For everything.", "Because she can only have one support person, and he would be taking that person's place.  So when, for his own well-being, he left before things got very messy, she'd then be completely alone.", "I completely agree that he shouldn't be the one in the room and he should accept your decision with grace because not only is it your medical procedure but he also knows he faints. He's allowed to be disappointed but just at the situation in general and not at you.\n\nBut I'm confused why it's a problem for him to just drop you off then come back after the baby is born. He would be sitting alone in the waiting room for who knows how long. If any medical decision needed to be made the doctor would have to talk to him outside the room anyway because the precautions and there would likely already be blood involved so in that case a phone call works too.", "Or pull out the steaks when the labor starts, then have who OP wants in there with her while hubby's being revived in the lobby.", "It's selfish to demand that she forgo having someone that can physically do the job of supporting her in favor of him. If a bunch of AH pals are ragging on him that makes his reasons even more selfish, not less.", "OP's personal reality is that her body is about to be ripped open for another human being to come through, and that her partner is more wrapped up in ME ME ME than in supporting her. (He's not a jerk for his squeamishness with blood, but he IS a massive jerk for emotionally blackmailing her for seeking the support she needs.) \n\nThat's pretty hard to deal with too.", "For me, it is not that he is saying he won't be there; it is why he is saying that. He isn't going to the hospital as some sort of punishment/childish then I'll take my toys and go response. If he is at the hospital he can see the baby right away, he is there for any medical decisions that might come up that OP can't make, etc.", "Terrible take. Mothers and babies still DIE in childbirth routinely even in developed countries, and OP had a serious medical event during her last delivery. It's disgusting to shame OP advocating for her own needs during an event where she could have serious medical complications. If her husband can't handle not being \"the most important person in the world\" while she literally risks her life to bring his fucking child into the world, he's not fit to be a father or a husband.\n\nNow, maybe he's just temporarily emotional and he'll get over it. OK, fine. But he very much does need to get the fuck over it.", "I think she wants effective support during a life threatening medical event.", "Because that\u2019s even more less supportive\u2026 would you rather if you were bleeding out from childbirth, that your husband or the person that you had sex with and gotten pregnant with\u2026 was there to support you instead of being a vindictive asshole?", "Why don't you want her to have effective help?\n\nSecondarily, why do you want to risk injury to him, and create a man-sized hazard in the delivery room?", "My husband said it looked like someone shot a deer.  Like OP, I hemorrhaged.", "uh the same he would be if he was in the room minus the passing out.", "If he can't support you, why is he upset he's not the chosen support person...? NTA - your husband's selfishness in his desire to publicly faint and be useless when his wife needs his help is astonishing.", "NTA - giving birth is terrifying and if he can\u2018t really be there for you because of his fainting, he really has no need to be your only support in there, because\n essentially you\u2018ll be on your own. \n\nand the deliveryroom is the place where what the mother to be wants goes, he can\u2018t even watch it without fainting, what does he think this whole experience feels like for you? \nthis isn\u2018t about him, this is about how you can make this already extremely painful, exhausting experience as comfortable as possible for you, you don\u2018t need the extra worry of him fainting and you ultimately going through this alone.", "NTA. Also you're doing both of you a favour by not letting him in if he really is so sensitive to the sight of blood. He's there to support you, no other reason, and if he can't do that, you need someone else there.", "NTA he's turning this round to be a YOU problem...when it's actually HIM who's the problem.

I gave birth to my daughter in a hospital, but everything happened so quickly and there were no doctors or nurses in the room at the time because the hospital was so busy.

If that\u2019s a way around the rules I\u2019d consider that and have your husband still come.\n\nLast time was he able to still support your labor from his chair? Or was he just hanging out? Did you discuss with him and give him a chance to explain how he\u2019ll be able to support you?  \n\nI\u2019d say NAH.  But I personally could never ban my husband.  And I can\u2019t imagine my marriage being the same if I did.  I have 3 kids, had only my husband for 2 and 3.  For the first other people came in to chat during early labor but it was just us for actual delivery.  I can\u2019t imagine picking someone else.  As the mom or best friend I\u2019d also feel uncomfortable knowing that I was involved in causing issues in your relationship.\n\nOn my kids birthdays we look at their baby books and end up reminiscing about their early days.

When I was in labor with my first the nurses made my very nervous ex sit down when I got my epidural. They told us how a few years back a soon to be dad passed out while watching his wife get an epidural and hit his neck on a countertop and died.
