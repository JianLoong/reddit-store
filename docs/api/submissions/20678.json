The house is owned by the parents of one of my roommates and we've lived here for 2-years.  I am currently the only one staying at the house right now, the other 3 moved back home to work for the summer.  Last summer, all 4 of us went home for the summer months.  \n\nLast fall we threw a party that got broken up by the police due to a noise violation from one of our neighbors.  All 4 of us ended up getting charged with a couple misdemeanors.  We always made a point to talk to our neighbors before throwing a party to let them know to please contact us before calling the police and we'll take care of things.  All of them were very receptive to this, but we don't throw big parties so it never actually got to that point before.  \n\nInstead of just paying our fines, we decided to appear in court.  We had gotten signed statements from 4 separate neighbors saying that on the night our party was busted, they didn't hear a thing.  The officers that busted our party didn't make the court appearance and the judge ended up dropping our charges and we only had to pay court fees.  \n\nLast week, I was watching TV when I noticed an elderly woman in our front yard with a giant sheet.  She had laid it on the ground and was shaking a mulberry tree we have in our yard.  I went out and asked her what she was doing and she said she was harvesting the mulberries before they go bad.  She said the previous owners let her do it for years. I politely asked her to leave but she kept making excuses about the berries going to waste and that she had been doing this for years.  Eventually, I had to tell her that if she doesn't leave, I'm calling the cops.\n\nA couple days later, a middle-aged guy knocked on my door, he said he was the lady's son.  He told me that his mom had been harvesting the mulberries for years and that it's literally no harm for her to do it now that we are living here.  I told him I just don't feel comfortable with it and given her age, if she fell or hurt herself, I don't want my friend's parents to be liable.  \n\nHe got defensive and said his mom just wants to use the berries for some baking and I don't have to do anything.  I told him I could try to talk to my friend's parents, but until then she can't take the berries.  He told me I'm being a little punk and that the neighborhood is going downhill due to college kids moving in everywhere.  \n\nI told him that we've never had any trouble with the neighbors and he said something about a party being busted.  I asked him how he knew about that and he stammered and said everyone in the neighborhood knows about it.  I asked him if his mom was the one who called in the complaint and he denied it.  \n\nI told him that I didn't need to talk to my friend's parents, his mom is no longer welcome on the property and if I catch her trying to take mulberries again, I'm calling the cops.  He had some choice words for me as he left, but I haven't seen him or his mom since.

Her son came to my house later and tried to talk me into letting his mom take the berries.  But turns out she was the neighbor who called in a noise complaint on us last fall, resulting in a party getting busted.  So, I refused to allow her to take the mulberries, but her son thinks I'm being a little punk.

So be prepared.  Find out what the quiet hours are in your area.  If there is a maximum decibel limit, get a cheap meter and set it up in front of a camera.  That way you have a time stamped recording of just how loud things are.  Go again to all your neighbors and tell them about the party.  Invite them over.  Then sit back and wait for the cops.\n\n3) Talk to your friend's parents.  Explain the situation.  Tell them you know who called the police on them for the party and then about your experience with the old lady and her son.  Get it in writing that she is not to take the mulberries WITHOUT WRITTEN PERMISSION FROM THE HOMEOWNERS.  Not you, not the son of the homeowners, the parents.  Go to a bank and have that shit notarized.  \n\nLook man....petty people get petty revenge.\n\nSo be prepared", "Being neighborly involves reciprocity. They likely called the police on you, and you\u2019re not under any obligation to continue to be nice if she called the police. I would tell your landlord what happened (and maybe shake the ripe berries off the tree and on the ground).", "NTA. The noise complaint is irrelevant. You're correct that if she was injured on the property your friend's parents would be liable.", "NTA - she shouldnt be on the property without permission, regardless of the party or not.", "You're NTA. Liability is a thing, and anyone getting pushy and rude about being allowed on someone else's property and help themselves to free fruit is TA.", "NTA even if she didn't call the police. If she injures herself on your property, the owners are liable. Elderly folks are more likely to get injured", "NTA\n\n.....and harvest those delicious berries yourself.  You might want to try them with sour cream and brown sugar.  Easy peasy.", "NTA. Technically, you can have her trespassed if she does it again, but I'd give her another chance. If she doesn't leave when you ask her to, call the cops. I had a neighbor in my yard often when I first moved where I live. \"The previous owners...\" I'm not them, so I asked them not to come over anymore. They listened, and we're cool with each other.", "NTA. You need permission from the owne and you said that. They know new people moved in and should have asked. And you're correct, if she's injured on the property they could try to come after the owners.", "NTA. And the party is irrelevant to the story. \n\nI\u2019m a home canner and baker and I love foraging for windfall fruit. The first rule of foraging is ALWAYS ASK PERMISSION. Every year. Just because someone said yes last year doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a yes this year. You asked her to leave and she is the one who escalated it.", "NTA. The legal aspect of liability alone puts you in the right. But I'm just wondering if they shot themselves in the foot with the attitude and also by placing themselves at the top of the list of suspects calling the police. You might want to collect the mulberries to avoid further confrontation.", "NTA - anyone that calls the cops before contacting a neighbor for a noise complaint is not a civil person. I\u2019d let the berries rot before letting her have any.", "leaning towards not TA but INF_O: was your party actually noisy to the point a noise complaint was reasonable?\n\nedit: NTA based on your answer. you\u2019re just playing by the rules set out by the neighborhood - the only thing is if you\u2019re singling out only this neighbor in particular without some good evidence. that might be problematic but it sounds like you have good reasons to suspect her.", "NTA    you had no idea they were the ones who called the cops, the first time you told her to stop gathering berries. \n\nI have a crabapple tree on my front lawn, I am happy when people want to take them (it means I have less to clean up) but asking me first is what I want. I got extremely pissed, for liability reasons, when someone climbed the tree to harvest them.", "NTA. Never understood noise complaints from old people. All of my immediate neighbors are over 60 and when we moved in we told them about a party that might get loud. One neighbor said \"I can't hear anything anyways\" and another said \"I don't work so I don't have to wake up early.\" \n\nNot super fun only having neighbors older than my parents but they're all really nice", "NTA", "Bro what\u2019s with middle age people getting piss when young adults movie in, he\u2019s a punk", "NTA. Whether they made the noise complaint or not, it\u2019s not their property.", "YTA\n\nThis forum isn't \"can I legally do this\" it's am I the AH for doing this and I think you're being a bitter, vengeful dude going after the old elderly mulberry pie baking lady when you know perfectly well that your party was too loud and that's why you got busted up and had a noise citation issued by the cops.\n\nHow do you know your party was too loud? 1) **By your own statement, you warned 4 different neighbors about the party and begged them to call to you first rather than go to the cops. 2) You say you had 15 people there, which is a fairly big party. 3) The police came out and you received a noise violation.** \n\nSo rather than getting this stuck in your craw and looking for ways to terrorize this little old lady who makes pies, be a better neighbor and next time you throw a party, keep the volume down.", "YTA.  You wouldn't have even mentioned the noise complaint if this wasn't a revenge move.  She wasn't hurting anything, and if she was trespassing in the front yard the home owner would not have been held responsible.  You'd rather have the berries go to waste than have an elderly woman who told on you get them.", "I doubt you give a rat's ass about mulberries or even whether she slips and falls.  You had a problem with her because of the previous issue with the noise complaint (**and you don't even know which neighbor called that in**).\n\nYou could have easily texted your roommate whose parents own the property, to ask about the situation.  If they have had a good relationship with this woman and allowed mulberry-harvesting for years, then you're the asshole tenant and they might not appreciate that.\n\nESH, Everybody Sucks Here.  You most of all.  Him just for calling you a punk and yammering about college kids ruining the neighborhood.", "NTA. I would have been a y.t.a till the guy slipped up and snitched on his own mom lol. Fuck them berries, fuck that granny, Rip to some tasty baked treats.", "If it was really about liability, why wouldn\u2019t you be a bro and just offer to shake the tree and get the berries for her ?

When you're old enough to actually want a good relationship with your neighborhood and community, I hope you remember this.", "Enjoy having your vehicles covered in purple crow shit.\n\nOld lady was doing something that benefited the both of you.\n\nYTA...Have fun with the purple poop. Crows love these berries...The old lady was doing something by collecting and drying the berries..", "YTA. You had the chance to be a good neighbor, and you blew it. \n\nWhen you throw a party, you're hoping your neighbors will be understanding and flexible for a night. \n\nAnd this time your neighbor was asking you to extend the same kind of neighborly courtesy, and you didn't do it.

And not in all circumstances, but especially if the injuries cause some kind of long-lasting effects or it was especially expensive to address them, your health insurance may require you to sue the property owner, even if it's unlikely to be successful, as a condition of paying your medical bills. Americans' reputation as being especially litigious is in large part due to how our entire healthcare and health insurance system is built to line the pockets of the wealthy.", "Pretty sure once you\u2019re on someone property they can shoot you though? Go figure", "This is much more complicated than that, and is muddied by corporations actively pushing propaganda to make people think lawsuits are all ridiculous. Yes, you can sue for injuring yourself while trespassing on someone else's property. But the cases you find are all situations where the property was dangerous, intentionally trapped, or other serious situations. And you're liable because of the potential for someone who is there for perfectly valid reasons. Imagine a firefighter who's trying to evacuate the house, or a kid wandering onto the property. \"You did a crime therefore the law no longer protects you\" isn't really a standard you want to set.\n\nYou'll also hear stories about this kind of thing that are just bullshit. \"My brother's friend's cousin knew a guy that...\" level of stuff. When you actually look deeper, the stories are very different and much more reasonable. For example, the woman who sued for her coffee being too hot almost died from her injuries, and McDonald's knew they served coffee dangerously hot. The \"thief who fell through a skylight and sued\" was actually a teenager who snuck onto a school roof, and fell through because the skylight was painted over and disguised. He was permanently paralyzed and barely survived.\n\nNobody is being sued because some random person ran onto their property and did something ridiculous dangerous nobody could have ever forseen. There's always far more to the story once you actually look into it.", "It's not really true.

I love it", "Why don't you just eat the mulberries? When they're in season, I just go to the trees and have the mulberries right then and there. Usually I bring along a couple of little kids, and we excitedly point them out to each other, and since I'm the tall one, I reach up and pluck them and hand them to the kids. The three of us have a gala time having mulberries every day until the season is over.", "Interesting! Did they used to allow the neighbor to harvest mulberries, or perhaps was the neighbor doing it without asking back then too?", "Ours is about the same height, but it's growing (or several are) around a cottonwood that we played in as kids. Last week, I threw my niece (3) and nephew (5) on top of the cottonwood base that's 6 feet high and told them to grab on and swing from the bigger mulberry branches.
