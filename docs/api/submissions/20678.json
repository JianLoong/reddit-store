The house is owned by the parents of one of my roommates and we've lived here for 2-years.  I am currently the only one staying at the house right now, the other 3 moved back home to work for the summer.  Last summer, all 4 of us went home for the summer months.  \n\nLast fall we threw a party that got broken up by the police due to a noise violation from one of our neighbors.  All 4 of us ended up getting charged with a couple misdemeanors.  We always made a point to talk to our neighbors before throwing a party to let them know to please contact us before calling the police and we'll take care of things.  All of them were very receptive to this, but we don't throw big parties so it never actually got to that point before.  \n\nInstead of just paying our fines, we decided to appear in court.  We had gotten signed statements from 4 separate neighbors saying that on the night our party was busted, they didn't hear a thing.  The officers that busted our party didn't make the court appearance and the judge ended up dropping our charges and we only had to pay court fees.  \n\nLast week, I was watching TV when I noticed an elderly woman in our front yard with a giant sheet.  She had laid it on the ground and was shaking a mulberry tree we have in our yard.  I went out and asked her what she was doing and she said she was harvesting the mulberries before they go bad.  She said the previous owners let her do it for years. I politely asked her to leave but she kept making excuses about the berries going to waste and that she had been doing this for years.  Eventually, I had to tell her that if she doesn't leave, I'm calling the cops.\n\nA couple days later, a middle-aged guy knocked on my door, he said he was the lady's son.  He told me that his mom had been harvesting the mulberries for years and that it's literally no harm for her to do it now that we are living here.  I told him I just don't feel comfortable with it and given her age, if she fell or hurt herself, I don't want my friend's parents to be liable.  \n\nHe got defensive and said his mom just wants to use the berries for some baking and I don't have to do anything.  I told him I could try to talk to my friend's parents, but until then she can't take the berries.  He told me I'm being a little punk and that the neighborhood is going downhill due to college kids moving in everywhere.  \n\nI told him that we've never had any trouble with the neighbors and he said something about a party being busted.  I asked him how he knew about that and he stammered and said everyone in the neighborhood knows about it.  I asked him if his mom was the one who called in the complaint and he denied it.  \n\nI told him that I didn't need to talk to my friend's parents, his mom is no longer welcome on the property and if I catch her trying to take mulberries again, I'm calling the cops.  He had some choice words for me as he left, but I haven't seen him or his mom since.

Her son came to my house later and tried to talk me into letting his mom take the berries.  But turns out she was the neighbor who called in a noise complaint on us last fall, resulting in a party getting busted.  So, I refused to allow her to take the mulberries, but her son thinks I'm being a little punk.  I think I might be an asshole for not letting an elderly neighbor harvest mulberriess from our yard even though we aren't using them.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

So be prepared.  Find out what the quiet hours are in your area.  If there is a maximum decibel limit, get a cheap meter and set it up in front of a camera.  That way you have a time stamped recording of just how loud things are.  Go again to all your neighbors and tell them about the party.  Invite them over.  Then sit back and wait for the cops.\n\n3) Talk to your friend's parents.  Explain the situation.  Tell them you know who called the police on them for the party and then about your experience with the old lady and her son.  Get it in writing that she is not to take the mulberries WITHOUT WRITTEN PERMISSION FROM THE HOMEOWNERS.  Not you, not the son of the homeowners, the parents.  Go to a bank and have that shit notarized.  \n\nLook man....petty people get petty revenge.\n\nSo be prepared", "Being neighborly involves reciprocity. They likely called the police on you, and you\u2019re not under any obligation to continue to be nice if she called the police on you. I would tell your landlord what happened (and maybe shake the ripe berries off the tree and on the ground).", "NTA. The noise complaint is irrelevant. You're correct that if she was injured on the property your friend's parents would be liable.", "NTA - she shouldnt be on the property without permission, regardless of the party or not.", "You're NTA. Liability is a thing, and anyone getting pushy and rude about being allowed on someone else's property and help themselves to free fruit is TA.", "NTA even if she didn't call the police. If she injures herself on your property, the owners are liable. Elderly folks are more likely to get injured", "NTA\n\n.....and harvest those delicious berries yourself.  You might want to try them with sour cream and brown sugar.  Easy peasy.", "NTA. Technically, you can have her trespassed if she does it again, but I'd give her another chance. If she doesn't leave when you ask her to, call the cops. I had a neighbor in my yard often when I first moved where I live. \"The previous owners...\" I'm not them, so I asked them not to come over anymore. They listened, and we're cool with each other.", "NTA. You need permission from the owne and you said that. They know new people moved in and should have asked. And you're correct, if she's injured on the property they could try to come after the owners.", "NTA. And the party is irrelevant to the story. \n\nI\u2019m a home canner and baker and I love foraging for windfall fruit. The first rule of foraging is ALWAYS ASK PERMISSION. Every year. Just because someone said yes last year doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a yes this year. You asked her to leave and she is the one who escalated it.", "NTA. The legal aspect of liability alone puts you in the right. But I'm just wondering if they shot themselves in the foot with the attitude and also by placing themselves at the top of the list of suspects calling the police. You might want to collect the mulberries to avoid further confrontation.", "NTA - anyone that calls the cops before contacting a neighbor for a noise complaint is not a civil person. I\u2019d let the berries rot before letting her have any.", "leaning towards not TA but INF_O: was your party actually noisy to the point a noise complaint was reasonable?\n\nedit: NTA based on your answer. you\u2019re just playing by the rules set out by the neighborhood - the only thing is if you\u2019re singling out only this neighbor in particular without some good evidence. that might be problematic but it sounds like you have good reasons to suspect her.", "NTA    you had no idea they were the ones who called the cops, the first time you told her to stop gathering berries. \n\nI have a crabapple tree on my front lawn, I am happy when people want to take them (it means I have less to clean up) but asking me first is what I want. I got extremely pissed, for liability reasons, when someone climbed the tree to harvest them.", "NTA. Never understood noise complaints from old people. All of my immediate neighbors are over 60 and when we moved in we told them about a party that might get loud. One neighbor said \"I can't hear anything anyways\" and another said \"I don't work so I don't have to wake up early.\" \n\nNot super fun only having neighbors older than my parents but they're all really nice", "NTA", "Bro what\u2019s with middle age people getting piss when young adults movie in, he\u2019s a punk", "NTA. Whether they made the noise complaint or not, it\u2019s not their property.", "YTA\n\nThis forum isn't \"can I legally do this\" it's am I the AH for doing this and I think you're being a bitter, vengeful dude going after the old elderly mulberry pie baking lady when you know perfectly well that your party was too loud and that's why you got busted up and had a noise citation issued by the cops.\n\nHow do you know your party was too loud? 1) **By your own statement, you warned 4 different neighbors about the party and begged them to call to you first rather than go to the cops. 2) You say you had 15 people there, which is a fairly big party. 3) The police came out and you received a noise violation.** \n\nSo rather than getting this stuck in your craw and looking for ways to terrorize this little old lady who makes pies, be a better neighbor and next time you throw a party, keep the volume down.", "YTA.  You wouldn't have even mentioned the noise complaint if this wasn't a revenge move.  She wasn't hurting anything, and if she was trespassing in the front yard the home owner would not have been held responsible.  You'd rather have the berries go to waste than have an elderly woman who told on you get them.", "I doubt you give a rat's ass about mulberries or even whether she slips and falls.  You had a problem with her because of the previous issue with the noise complaint (**and you don't even know which neighbor called that in**).\n\nYou could have easily texted your roommate whose parents own the property, to ask about the situation.  If they have had a good relationship with this woman and allowed mulberry-harvesting for years, then you're the asshole tenant and they might not appreciate that.\n\nESH, Everybody Sucks Here.  You most of all.  Him just for calling you a punk and yammering about college kids ruining the neighborhood.", "NTA. I would have been a y.t.a till the guy slipped up and snitched on his own mom lol. Fuck them berries, fuck that granny, Rip to some tasty baked treats.", "If it was really about liability, why wouldn\u2019t you be a bro and just offer to shake the tree and get the berries for her ? You probably would of gotten a pie and some good will. YTA", "YTA. When you're old enough to actually want a good relationship with your neighborhood and community, I hope you remember this.", "Enjoy having your vehicles covered in purple crow shit.\n\nOld lady was doing something that benefited the both of you.\n\nYTA...Have fun with the purple poop. Crows love these berries...The old lady was doing something by collecting and drying the berries..", "YTA. You had the chance to be a good neighbor, and you blew it. \n\nWhen you throw a party, you're hoping your neighbors will be understanding and flexible for a night. \n\nAnd this time your neighbor was asking you to extend the same kind of neighborly courtesy, and you didn't do it. Are you surprised her son came over and told you the truth?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

All other issues aside- you don't owe anything to trespassing neighbors.  They could have easily rung the bell or left a note to introduce themselves, explain their history with the previous owner, and ask about the berries.  The older lady, maybe she's not all the way there and didn't think things through, but the son in particular is way out of line.", "NTA..I have a mulberry tree in my back yard right where a walkway is and I couldn't count how many times I've seen people in my yard picking mulberries like it's their tree. It's so annoying.", "As a survivor of the insurance industry, your are 1000% correct. If anything happened to her, the homeowners policy would respond first via either medical payments to others (no legal action taken) or bodily injury (if she sued). If she turned out to be a vexatious litigant it would be a nightmare for your friends\u2019 parents.", "Looks like you found the neighborhood party pooper.

Don't bite a hand that feeds!", "maybe nta but def. very petty youre only in your mid 20s enjoy yourself you seem to be on track of the old get off my lawn person that would call the police on college kids partying", "solid advice, look at this OP!", "This this this... All of this.", "I already talked with my friend and his parents, they agree they don't want a neighbor on the property.

She had 100% been collecting the mulberries for years.  For the most part young men are oblivious with their surroundings and not empathetic to the elderly.  I side with the woman\u2019s son.", "We had maybe 12-15 people over, but everyone was in our basement.  Even the police who showed up said they couldn't hear anything from our front steps.  But we don't live in a typical \"college\" neighborhood.  It's a lot of families and older people.  Only thing I can think of is that some of our friends parked down the street and were loud on their way to our house.", "15 people is not a big party. When my husband's family gets.together for lunch there are close to 20 people. Just his siblings, their spouses and all the kids. \n\nI have a friend who used.to he the cops called on him for noise complaints all the time but he threw parties of 60+ people. That is a big party.", "Idk how it is in other places but we usually ignore loud hous parties and will only politely ask them to keep it down UNLESS more than 2/3 people complain then we issue a citation.

Just not those 2.", "I definitely am old enough, and have an amazing neighbourhood, with a lovely mix of elderly, families and young people.\nOP isn\u2019t the one in the wrong here, and there is nothing worse than having an elderly neighbour that thinks they can do whatever they want just because they are old, they are worse than idiot young neighbours that don\u2019t know any better yet.\n\nIf the old lady had politely knocked on the door and said would you mind if I took some mulberries, the previous owners had no problem with it? That\u2019s very different to what happened here.\n\nAnd they for sure were the ones who called the cops rather than talking to the kids, so fuck them.", "This is the best answer, I delighted the mulberries won\u2019t go to waste!", ">But my friend's mom asked me to harvest as many mulberries as I can fit in the freezer and she'll make pies for us.\n\nIt sounds like you have pretty nice landlords!", "Get some petty revenge on an annoying neighbor AND you get pie? That's what I call a happy ending", "Make sure you maintain uninterrupted eye contact while harvesting the berries.

I'm guessing she went \"look at that, all those fine mulberries going to waste bc those noisy brats don't pick them, I should go there and pick them myself like I used to do\"\n\nETA: OP said in a comment that the arrangement might have been with the previous owners. Current owners don't know the lady at all.", "I wouldn't think you'd be charged with anything if the police said they couldn't hear anything from the front steps.", "A family of 15 people made up of married couples and children is different than 15 college dudes.\n\nI still maintain if they were being so quiet, no one would have called the police in the first place and if there wasn't any noise issue when the cops got there, they wouldn't have received a noise violation.", "Which you didn't know would happen when you stopped the elderly neighbor.  You were simply being petty to get back at her.", "And they told you to call the cops on her? They may not \"know\" her but they obviously know about the berry-harvesting and haven't stopped it until you came on the scene as the berry enforcer.", "He also sounds like a pretty good tenant. Props all around!", "That was our argument with them at the time as well.  But all 4 of us still got charged with \"disturbing the neighborhood\" and \"unlawful assembly.\"", "I also didn't know that she was \"probably\" the one who called in the noise complaint until her son spilled that bit of information.  To me, she was just some old lady shaking a tree in the front yard who got combative when I asked her what she was doing.", "They said that if either of them comes back to call them first and they will take care of it.", "Which is why the cops didn't show up\n\nThe wrote the tickets because you are college students and figured you'd just pay the tickets.\n\nThey knew the charges wouldn't hold up in court so they didn't bather showing up for court", "It sounds more likely it was the son instead of his mother.", "If they\u2019re neighbours, why is it hard to believe that they just witnessed the bust? You even said you got statements from other neighbours after the fact. I don\u2019t see how him mentioning the busted party is any proof that they were the ones that actually called it in.", "So here's how it should have gone down, if you weren't a petty asshole:\n\n1. Lady starts harvesting, so you text your friend to inquire\n2. Friend/parents says they don't want her harvesting\n3. You go out and let her know you spoke with them and that's the deal\n4. She either stops and leaves OR you let the friend's parents know\n\nNo cops, no threats, no repeat visits from other neighbors.", "This is exactly it! And it happens a lot more than people think! Always fight tickets if you know the ticket is bullshit!", "Here's some other options:\n\n1. Lady asks permission before harvesting anything from someone else's property.\n2. I contact property owners to get their opinion on it and I act based on their response.", "I've gotten 5 speeding tickets in my life, 2 I paid because they were reasonable, one I fought just because I was broke and it did help because the judge reduced it a bit, but the cop showed up to testify and it was a fair bust so I still paid. \n\nThe last 2 were straight bullshit, cops pulled me over and made up a reason once I was stopped. I fought both and neither showed up to court since they knew they had no evidence of anything. Always fight the BS ones is my take-away."]}
