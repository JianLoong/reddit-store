Either lack of hygiene or too much \"hygiene\" such as douching or using irritating soaps. Either way she needs a trip to the gyno for sure. Definitely tell her in private, not around your other friends and be as gentle as possible.

I think I saw this woman twice, and both times the smell was so, so bad. She looked groomed and like she took care of herself, so I can't imagine it was lack of regular personal care, but she was obese and a little older, so I wonder if that could have been part of a contributory factor (diabetes can increase the chances someone gets a yeast infection; obesity can apparently negatively affect someone's sense of smell). I was thinking to email the course provider about this. I ended up not doing it because I wouldn't see her more than these two times as it was a short course. I have another story about a young-ish man who came to some group social functions I attended with friends and his smell was so rancid, he stank up any room (even larger rooms like a bar function room) he entered. It was so foul that several people talked about it amongst themselves and the organisers considered asking him to leave. It's truly beyond me how it's possible that sometimes people don't smell themselves.\n\nBut you should tell your friend. The woman from your friend group whom she is closest to should be the one to have a private conversation about it with her (I think it should be a woman because it is very likely that the smell is caused by a female health issue and I think it's best for a concern like this to come from a friend of the same sex). This woman friend could even email if in person is too uncomfortable. Just straight to the fact, especially since she has already denied the smell comes from her: \"We all love you but you have such a strong and unpleasant body odour that we are worried for your health. We know you wash and groom yourself, so we know it's not a lack in standard personal hygiene, but clearly something is up and you should get yourself checked out. Of course we want to continue hanging out with you because we love your company, but the smell is so bad, and we just can't continue to put up with it. Please see your family doctor or a dermatologist asap. It's undoubtedly also not just us who can smell it, so we are also worried for your professional and social life outside of our friend group.

That can make someone feel guilty or attacked. It's just such a sensitive topic and a good PCP or OBGYN would able to detect that. I think she needs to sit her down, tell her she needs to address something private and potentially uncomfortable, but she loves her and wants her to be healthy.

They are all late 20s/around 30 I assume, which is well past the time where someone is learning how to wash themselves: this isn't a teacher asking a smelly (young) teen how they wash themselves in order to pass down different/better knowledge when they suspect the parents aren't doing their job.\n\nAsking someone this age how they wash themselves is patronising and beating around the bush, neither are good for friendships.

What you\u2019re describing is unfortunately very common (taking antibiotics for a bacterial infection kills some \u201cgood\u201d bacteria along with the \u201cbad\u201d bacteria, which can encourage fungal overgrowth and cause a yeast infection). I\u2019ve struggled with this too, every time I\u2019m prescribed antibiotics I ask the doctor for a prescription for Diflucan/fluconazole as well (antifungal that you take at the same time as the antibiotics, this combo allows treatment of the bacterial infection and also prevents a yeast infection from starting). Taking probiotics during an antibiotic course, or even all the time, can also help keep your microbiota in check", "Yeah that makes sense. \n\nI'm Australian so it costs nothing (or very little) for healthcare. \n\nI 100% agree with you that some people were never taught proper personal hygiene.

My doctor said the critters can form a dense microfilm in little crevices around the cervix that's hard for meds to penetrate, but boric acid breaks it down.", "Boric acid is fine. You really have to but the ones specifically for inserting in your vagina. Of COURSE drs will tell you now to use it. They want to prescribe you medicine for it and get money", "Interesting!! Thanks for sharing your experience. Good information to have on hand \ud83e\udd70", "I have to second this because nothing else worked for me. I dealt with reoccurring yeast infections and BV for multiple years as well. The medication my Dr. prescribed me would make my pH go out of wack and it started a vicious cycle where I'd be getting treatment for BV that increased the chance of getting a yeast infection. \n\nThen one day someone on reddit suggested boric acid! I was so desperate for a solution and tried it, and it worked. I haven't had to use it for 2+ years now."]}
