You can do better than that. \n\nOne time, I absolutely *belched*, honestly shocking myself in the process, and could hear him pissing himself with laughter from another room.

I hold myself to the same standards  ( literally cannot remember the last time I burped audibly,  even when I am on my own at home. )\n\nI think this is just something where you two have different perspectives on it and that doesn't make either of you an asshole.  This is the same thing as not everyone being okay with sitting on the toilet with your partner walking in etc.  Not everyone has the same understanding of what goes in a comfort zone,  and it seems that for your husband burping is one of those things he just dislikes across the board and doesn't read as a positive sign of being comfortable.\n\nNonetheless,  I don't think you're an asshole for it.

This is one of those internal relationship judgment calls like  using the toilet when the other person is in the shower, etc. You're not an AH for wanting to burp openly but he's not an AH for wanting to preserve a little mystery.

If you think he\u2019s fantasizing about some sexy chick burping in his face, you\u2019re wrong. Most men will not be turned on by such behaviour. But perhaps the bigger issue is why you\u2019re burping so much. Is it a bad diet or foods that are causing this? Too much soda? Maybe you\u2019re eating too quickly? I\u2019d speak with your doctor and hopefully come up with a solution.", "He told you it makes him uncomfortable. I would refrain from doing it as he probably finds it unattractive. An occasional burp can be forgiven. If you do it regularly, see a doctor.", "Devil's advocate sort of here, but do you quiet burp and cover yourself at home too? I understand being comfortable, but why can't you show your husband the same respect you show the public? Why do you have to burp louder when it's just you and him? I'm icky about burps and farts etc. and I'd hope my partner wouldn't just belch out in my face just because they're comfortable with me, it's just decency", "YTA. Apparently unpopular opinion on Reddit: Our loved ones don't deserve *less* consideration than the general public, they deserve more.\n\nIf you can \"quiet burp\" in public, why are you randomly doing gross loud burps in front of your spouse who's trying to remain attracted to you? Like, \"safe space\" is good, but \"keeping the magic alive\" is also good.\n\nMy answer would be different if the burps were accidental, but you go out of your way to say you have *full* control over your burps and your husband would be fine with the way you burp in public, you're just deliberately burping differently in front of him and he doesn't like it and you don't care. Which does make YTA. \n\nWould you like it if your husband acted one way prior to marriage, and then suddenly dramatically changed his behaviour after marriage? Would you not feel like he was taking you for granted, like he suddenly considered you \"trapped\" after you said your vows and now he doesn't have to 'try' anymore? Like his behaviour while trying to get you to *say* your vows was an \"act\", and now that you've 'committed', he can stop 'pretending' to be the person you thought he was, and he can \"be himself\" (his real self, the self he hid from you while dating) and blast you on the internet if you complain?\n\nPSA: You at your slobbiest is not your \"true self\". Yes, all of us burp, and poop. That doesn't mean we have to burp or poop in our loved ones' faces or else we're not being 'authentic'. It sounds like you've conflated the ideas of \"being yourself\" with \"exerting no effort whatsoever\", and that's just not reasonable. If anything, our most real selves are the selves we are when we're doing our *best,* which usually involves some level of effort and consideration for others.", "Unpopular opinion, but YTA for only the burping. I also hate it when people burp. I can\u2019t identify any one specific reason, but I hate the noise, feel like it\u2019s unsanitary, and is rude. My friends wife will burp out loud into her hand and then say excuse me afterward. Why say excuse me when you\u2019re purposefully being gross? If it\u2019s an accident, oh well, it happens. But purposefully being gross and then acting like you\u2019re trying to be polite is such a load of bull to me. We all know how to burp silently and if your loved one says they don\u2019t like it, it\u2019s not much of a sacrifice at all to just close your mouth. Again, that\u2019s only for the burping. The rest of the stuff your partner said is terrible and I hope they just aren\u2019t good at communicating their feelings.", "YTA it\u2019s in your husbands preference that he doesn\u2019t want to hear his wife burp he\u2019s allowed to think that way and if it\u2019s not a big deal then you should be polite and mind your husband the same way he should mind you if you prefer he not do something around you. And about be comfortable around him you should to a certain degree but some things are better left in private and that is for every individual relationship to figure out and your husband thinks burping is one of them you should respect his wishes the same he should for yours", "INFO.
