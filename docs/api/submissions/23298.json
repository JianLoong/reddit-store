If you think he\u2019s fantasizing about some sexy chick burping in his face, you\u2019re wrong. Most men will not be turned on by such behaviour. But perhaps the bigger issue is why you\u2019re burping so much. Is it a bad diet or foods that are causing this? Too much soda? Maybe you\u2019re eating too quickly? I\u2019d speak with your doctor and hopefully come up with a solution.", "He told you it makes him uncomfortable. I would refrain from doing it as he probably finds it unattractive. An occasional burp can be forgiven. If you do it regularly, see a doctor.", "Devil's advocate sort of here, but do you quiet burp and cover yourself at home too? I understand being comfortable, but why can't you show your husband the same respect you show the public? Why do you have to burp louder when it's just you and him? I'm icky about burps and farts etc. and I'd hope my partner wouldn't just belch out in my face just because they're comfortable with me, it's just decency", "YTA. Apparently unpopular opinion on Reddit: Our loved ones don't deserve *less* consideration than the general public, they deserve more.\n\nIf you can \"quiet burp\" in public, why are you randomly doing gross loud burps in front of your spouse who's trying to remain attracted to you? Like, \"safe space\" is good, but \"keeping the magic alive\" is also good.\n\nMy answer would be different if the burps were accidental, but you go out of your way to say you have *full* control over your burps and your husband would be fine with the way you burp in public, you're just deliberately burping differently in front of him and he doesn't like it and you don't care. Which does make YTA. \n\nWould you like it if your husband acted one way prior to marriage, and then suddenly dramatically changed his behaviour after marriage? Would you not feel like he was taking you for granted, like he suddenly considered you \"trapped\" after you said your vows and now he doesn't have to 'try' anymore? Like his behaviour while trying to get you to *say* your vows was an \"act\", and now that you've 'committed', he can stop 'pretending' to be the person you thought he was, and he can \"be himself\" (his real self, the self he hid from you while dating) and blast you on the internet if you complain?\n\nPSA: You at your slobbiest is not your \"true self\". Yes, all of us burp, and poop. That doesn't mean we have to burp or poop in our loved ones' faces or else we're not being 'authentic'. It sounds like you've conflated the ideas of \"being yourself\" with \"exerting no effort whatsoever\", and that's just not reasonable. If anything, our most real selves are the selves we are when we're doing our *best,* which usually involves some level of effort and consideration for others.", "Unpopular opinion, but YTA for only the burping. I also hate it when people burp. I can\u2019t identify any one specific reason, but I hate the noise, feel like it\u2019s unsanitary, and is rude. My friends wife will burp out loud into her hand and then say excuse me afterward. Why say excuse me when you\u2019re purposefully being gross? If it\u2019s an accident, oh well, it happens. But purposefully being gross and then acting like you\u2019re trying to be polite is such a load of bull to me. We all know how to burp silently and if your loved one says they don\u2019t like it, it\u2019s not much of a sacrifice at all to just close your mouth. Again, that\u2019s only for the burping. The rest of the stuff your partner said is terrible and I hope they just aren\u2019t good at communicating their feelings.", "YTA it\u2019s in your husbands preference that he doesn\u2019t want to hear his wife burp he\u2019s allowed to think that way and if it\u2019s not a big deal then you should be polite and mind your husband the same way he should mind you if you prefer he not do something around you. And about be comfortable around him you should to a certain degree but some things are better left in private and that is for every individual relationship to figure out and your husband thinks burping is one of them you should respect his wishes the same he should for yours", "INFO.

How is that remotely the same? Do you expect people to shit in the living room? What?!?\n\nCuz my family and I definitely do burp and fart in front each other and we rib each other over it.

My wife and I were friends for a while before we ever dated so we saw some things....

That completely gags me.   Or if you belch loudly without covering your mouth.", "YTA I get so disgusted when people burp in front of me so I totally get where he is coming from. If he has expressed that he is uncomfortable with this, you should respect him and at least treat it like a fart and go do it somewhere else.", "Right? People keep saying things like, \"if he can't handle a burp, how can will he handle _______.\" I dunno, I've handled diapers and puke and all sorts of gross things with my family but I still think unrestrained burps are rude and gross.

When you commit to a long term, monogamous relationship with someone - you make a sacrifice. You make a promise to remain faithful and express all of your desires to one person only. I think it\u2019s a sign of respect for that commitment made by your partner to maintain some boundaries in order to keep the spark alive. I\u2019m super comfortable with my partner - I don\u2019t wear sexy clothes or a full face of make up to relax at home. But I also don\u2019t go out of my way to actively be repulsive. I don\u2019t burp, fart, use the toilet, pick my nose etc. in front of him just because he\u2019s my partner.

YTA if he has asked you to stop and you won't.   \nI don't think it's necessary to burp loudly (unless you are sick or something) when anyone else is nearby. I don't think it's necessary to fart in the car or the same room as someone. If I burp, I can manage to keep it contained, and I say excuse me. If I have to fart, I will go into the bathroom to do it.   \nEspecially is someone does these things often, they become ruder and grosser to those within earshot. I have taught my kids to excuse myself - once they got past age 11 or so, they realized that it's not really funny and it's just nicer not to have to hear it (or smell it).   \nTrust me the honeymoon gets over and if you are doing things your husband finds off-putting, more and more things will start to grate on him.", "Thank you!

It was seen as rude and uncouth. I have never heard anyone in my family burp except my dad during a road trip once that he said was an accident and apologized after. I really like that my family doesn\u2019t burp, fart or anything of the sort in front of one another.\n\nI genuinely don\u2019t burp - never have. It\u2019s a thing with some people. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s from my upbringing or a biological quirk but it is what it is. As strange as it may sound to the burp enthusiasts, this inability is one of my favorite things about my body.\n\nI find the act of burping gross and smelly. It\u2019s ranked high on my disgust spectrum, especially when people try to make it as loud as possible. Same with farts. I understand we all have bodies that do gross things but a little decorum is always appreciated.", "Good. An effective way to weed out the weak ones.", "I said the same thing, 'I found my people' lol. I actually care about being attractive for my partner", "I've found my people", "The occasional one here and there have never bothered me, but now I live with someone who has a 5-10 minute burp-fest on a good day and at worst multiple times a day. Can you imagine someone burping this long, one after another? On top of that: coughing, sneezing and blowing her nose in common spaces every single day, on schedule. My husband and my children are at our wits end. We all have lost our appetites so many times and have given up on meals. I don\u2019t know what the hell got into this person over the last few years, but it is unbearable to live with someone like this.", "It actually makes me gag", "Oh, good Lord, I couldn't even imagine that.

I have a sleep app that tracks snoring lately. I hear monsters in my room. Lol but since I have 3 dogs that snore I can live in pure ignorant bliss and believe I'm a cute bunny.", "Along the same lines, I hate when my SO openly/purposefully farts in front of me, next to me, or constantly spitting when we are on a walk or just whenever\u2014 into the trash can when I\u2019m trying to eat dinner, etc. I actually do think that no matter HOW comfortable you are with your partner, their are just certain basic manners that should be maintained. What OP described doesn\u2019t seem like a big deal to me but I know I have my bodily function boundaries and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong to just want a certain level of respect in that regard."]}
