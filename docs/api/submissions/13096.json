We have two kids together. One is kindergarten age and the other is in daycare. Elizabeth worked a job 3 days a week that required 12 hour shifts (7am to 7:30pm) and because of that I was required to work close by. I needed to make sure my kids got off to school and daycare okay, pick them up on the days she worked, and have them fed and ready for bed when she got home. I felt like I needed to have a flexible schedule to do this because we couldn\u2019t afford 5 days of daycare with extended hours. Also, because I made less money I felt like it was my responsibility. \n\nElizabeth made more than double the money than I did and I was happy to do this. Keep in mind, my income wasn\u2019t poor and I made $60k on a good year. She eventually took a remote job in her field making even more money and my job shifted to remote as well. \n\nWe ended up splitting and I had to move in with my mom because I can\u2019t afford rent on my own right now. I foresee this being temporary, maybe a year or so while I save up for a house. \n\nMy mom has a fully furnished basement with a walkout door and currently my kids and I share the space. I have a Murphy bed and my kids have a bunk bed. There\u2019s plenty of space for me to work and for them to play. Not to mention the rest of the house is available to us. \n\nI\u2019d like to have them half the time but my ex absolutely refuses and is doing everything in her power to not let me have 50/50 custody. Keep in mind, I do not drink, I don\u2019t do drugs or gamble, or smoke cigarettes. I\u2019ve never had a problem with them in the past or have any addiction history. I don\u2019t hit my kids or yell. I believe in being firm but very gentle and I\u2019m very affectionate with my kids. Being a dad is practically the only thing I care about. \n\nMy ex\u2019s perspective is that it\u2019s too disruptive to have them going back and forth between homes and it\u2019s too confusing for them (we live 2 minutes from each other). And they deserve better than to be in a basement. She says she can provide for them better than I can. She\u2019s also very critical of me that I can\u2019t provide a home for them and live with my mom. She considers me to be a bad father because of that. When I mention that I couldn\u2019t have focused just on my career because I was also helping with the kids her rebuttal is that \u201cnobody told you to do that, if you went out and got a better job we could\u2019ve afforded daycare 5 days\u201d. The money just wasn\u2019t as important as being involved in my kids lives at that point, not to mention the dilemma of the cost of daycare. \n\nI\u2019m more than capable of buying their groceries and taking care of them when they\u2019re here but rent is so outrageous I can\u2019t afford it right now. \n\nI would really love some perspective on this. I\u2019ve been such a large part of my kids lives this far and I don\u2019t want to be an every other weekend dad.

Your current situation is temporary and will improved. \n\nFurthermore, if you live so near to her own home, co-parenting should be a bit easier day-to-day.

Make sure to include that in the argument. Therapy for you and the children together. Also, is she seeing someone? It seems like she's actively trying to portray you as a deadbeat so I'm wondering if that's the narrative she's pushing for because of a guy. She could be trying to replace you as a dad too, so be very careful. Document everything, collect everything, and don't say anything incriminating.
