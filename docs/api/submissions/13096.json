We have two kids together. One is kindergarten age and the other is in daycare. Elizabeth worked a job 3 days a week that required 12 hour shifts (7am to 7:30pm) and because of that I was required to work close by. I needed to make sure my kids got off to school and daycare okay, pick them up on the days she worked, and have them fed and ready for bed when she got home. I felt like I needed to have a flexible schedule to do this because we couldn\u2019t afford 5 days of daycare with extended hours. Also, because I made less money I felt like it was my responsibility. \n\nElizabeth made more than double the money than I did and I was happy to do this. Keep in mind, my income wasn\u2019t poor and I made $60k on a good year. She eventually took a remote job in her field making even more money and my job shifted to remote as well. \n\nWe ended up splitting and I had to move in with my mom because I can\u2019t afford rent on my own right now. I foresee this being temporary, maybe a year or so while I save up for a house. \n\nMy mom has a fully furnished basement with a walkout door and currently my kids and I share the space. I have a Murphy bed and my kids have a bunk bed. There\u2019s plenty of space for me to work and for them to play. Not to mention the rest of the house is available to us. \n\nI\u2019d like to have them half the time but my ex absolutely refuses and is doing everything in her power to not let me have 50/50 custody. Keep in mind, I do not drink, I don\u2019t do drugs or gamble, or smoke cigarettes. I\u2019ve never had a problem with them in the past or have any addiction history. I don\u2019t hit my kids or yell. I believe in being firm but very gentle and I\u2019m very affectionate with my kids. Being a dad is practically the only thing I care about. \n\nMy ex\u2019s perspective is that it\u2019s too disruptive to have them going back and forth between homes and it\u2019s too confusing for them (we live 2 minutes from each other). And they deserve better than to be in a basement. She says she can provide for them better than I can. She\u2019s also very critical of me that I can\u2019t provide a home for them and live with my mom. She considers me to be a bad father because of that. When I mention that I couldn\u2019t have focused just on my career because I was also helping with the kids her rebuttal is that \u201cnobody told you to do that, if you went out and got a better job we could\u2019ve afforded daycare 5 days\u201d. The money just wasn\u2019t as important as being involved in my kids lives at that point, not to mention the dilemma of the cost of daycare. \n\nI\u2019m more than capable of buying their groceries and taking care of them when they\u2019re here but rent is so outrageous I can\u2019t afford it right now. \n\nI would really love some perspective on this. I\u2019ve been such a large part of my kids lives this far and I don\u2019t want to be an every other weekend dad.

While it\u2019s true that the going back and forth can be hard for kids, that\u2019s something to work out together.

Your living situation is ideal, as you have a backup sitter and you live close to your wife so disruption CAN BE minimal. If you haven't already,  start documenting everything-school, weekends,  visitation, even birthdays etc. Judges like documentation and it's hard to argue with dates and times laid out, coherently.

They divorced before myself or my sister were in school.  My parents made sure no matter where we lived, we were in the same school district. Being 2 minutes away from each other is not going to be disruptive at all. Will the children need to learn a new schedule? Sure. It might take some time and adjusting, but kids aren\u2019t dumb, they can figure out every other week and which holiday/vacation they will be where with both parents guidance. \nUntil my dad and step mom got a house, my sister and I shared a room, and technically still would at my moms, who also lives with my grandparents. Did we survive? Obviously! Does that mean my mother was a bad mother because we shared a room and lived with our grandparents? Hell no! Same for my dad and step mom since we shared a room across\u2026 three different apartments before the house. Sharing a room does not equal bad parent! They did what they had to do to get us support.\nBasically OP, your ex\u2019s reasons are bullshit. It can be done, and you\u2019re not taking away opportunities from them for staying with your mom for a year. \nYou\u2019re not the asshole, and 50/50 is more than fair to ask for.\nEDIT: Updated for both parents on having me and my sibling share a room", "NTA, courts want both parents involved, and will grant 50/50 in most cases. Its not your exs call, let a judge make the call.", "NAH but that depends Do they have their own bedroom or are they in the same room as you? also this is for the courts to decide not you and your ex", "NTA and it's not really up to her. Go to court if you need to. I am confused though why you can't afford a rental on 60k a year but then I'm in a lower cost of living area what do I know.", "NTA. Go to court and request shared custody. Also if she makes double you may also be entitled to child support.", "Nta. Fight for 50/50 custody and child support.

You arent wrong for wanting more time with your kids but your ex is correct it will be very disruptive to share them 50/50. it is very hard to do this, especially with school age kids.\n\nYou said you make 60K a yr, why are you unable to afford somewhere to live, other than in your mom's basement?", "NTA. You sound like a great dad.", "NTA and please don\u2019t give up, a child needs both parents.", "I'm going to invite you to imagine the situation being reversed, as it has been for most of human history: A father claiming that his ex-wife has no right to 50/50 custody of their children because the mother doesn't make as much as he does.

Get some curtains to hang around their bed so it's technically a private room and get your ass to court. She doesn't want to pay child support (or alimony) and that's no reason to punish the kids by taking away your time with them.\n\nOne thing you can maybe do to throw her a bone is be flexible for vacations in the custody agreement. If she can afford to take them to Disney for 2 weeks or whatever, be cool with that - if you can't afford to, let her take them so the kids get that experience. And she gets a win which makes her feel better and maybe be less vindictive. (My custody agreement is unlimited international travel as long as no trip is more than 2 weeks, no travel to countries with a travel warning, and I have to prove I've bought a return ticket - none of those are hardships but it was \"protection\" for my ex in case I won the lotto and wanted us to live on a cruise ship or something lol)", "NTA-try and get all you can!", "There should be an abbreviation named ARP: Above Reddit's Paygrade.", "NTA. If you're in the US she doesn't need to worry about how you're going to provide for them because she'll likely owe you child support due to the income difference.

Your ex is the AH. \n\nYou\u2019ve mentioned mediation, and if you don\u2019t have an attorney the time to get one is now. You are probably entitled to way more custody, child support, and assets from the marriage than your wife would give up willingly.", "And since it sounds like you made career sacrifices to provide childcare, see if you can get child support. That might make it quicker to move out.", "I have. She\u2019s determined to fight me through mediation to the judge unless I agree to one day a week.", "The name game of this sub is making assumptions so I think imma do that here. She makes twice what OP makes and doesn\u2019t want him to have 50/50 custody while he was the primary caregiver for the kids. She may not want to pay child support", "Thank you. I don\u2019t want my kids to grow up and ask \u201cwhy didn\u2019t dad fight harder to have us?\u201d But her argument is starting to wear me down.", "And to clarify, I think she\u2019s being toxic because whether or not you live with your mother isn\u2019t the point. If they are safe, well-fed, and loved, that is more than enough for a child to thrive. Tight quarters aren\u2019t ideal, but they have a whole house upstairs that provides extra space for them to breathe. Your current situation is temporary and will improved. \n\nFurthermore, if you live so near to her own home, co-parenting should be a bit easier day-to-day. Again, not an ideal situation, but it would be more disruptive for your kids to not see you often when they\u2019re used to seeing you daily, and if there\u2019s a chance that they can see you both, that sounds more beneficial.", "Id add that from the sounds of it, the ex is vindictive and has an issue personally with OP and that she is attempting to isolate him From his kids. If she is so concerned with the finances to a point of throwing it in ops face then i would also assume she wants the child suppory from him hence the push for non equal custody", "That\u2019s fair.

He doesn't say if they had joint accounts but she could have emptied their's before leaving so he has nothing saved up and is now paycheck-to-paycheck.  And all this is not even talking about legal fees, of hes retained a good lawyer and they've already got mediation set up that was probably $5000 gone.", "She wants him to have his kids only one day a week and not 50/50. That is absolutely an AH thing to do.", "It\u2019s unfathomable to many people but $60k isn\u2019t enough in many of the highest cost of living areas. Often six figures at least is necessary to have a middle class lifestyle, and many homes have two six figure salaries and still have trouble affording luxuries.", "That last question is kinda weird. Not everyone has the money saved up to buy a house immediately after splitting up.", "50/50 is best for kids so that have as much time as possible with both parents.  I absolutely hate that argument you made.  If you don't want to disrupt your kids lives, don't get a divorce.", "So go to mediation", "You were the primary caregiver. If you take this to court, you might actually get more than 50%, especially if she still works a crazy schedule. Don't let her bully you, get a good lawyer, document everything.", "Yeah she probably doesn't, and she'd probably try to make him feel like shit for even suggesting it. \n\nBut she can't have it both ways - 'you're a bad father because you don't make enough money because you spent too much time looking after your kids while I worked non-childcare friendly hours' okay lady lmao", "She should also be worried about paying alimony as he took a flexible job to primary caregiver for the kids.  \n\nOP get an attorney who can explain your rights to you.", "OP I also suggest looking into therapy with the children. I don't know what her beef is with you, but look into her attempts at parental alienation. Don't give up, she may try to turn the children against you by trying to buy their affections. Make sure to include that in the argument. Therapy for you and the children together. Also, is she seeing someone? It seems like she's actively trying to portray you as a deadbeat so I'm wondering if that's the narrative she's pushing for because of a guy. She could be trying to replace you as a dad too, so be very careful. Document everything, collect everything, and don't say anything incriminating. Use a court ordered parenting app to communicate with her because she seems combative. Gather as much support as possible, friends and family, everyone. Have everyone vouch for you and your character. NTA", "Definitely seconding the partitions suggestion.

Do NOT agree to that!  Honestly, with the sacrifices you made it sounds like you were the primary parent during the marriage.  If she's so concerned about disrupting the schedule then SHE can take EOW and 1 day a week.", "Is there any way you can partition the basement to give them a bedroom?", "Don't agree to her terms, go to court. Call her bluff. And like everyone is saying, create partition of the floors.", "I don\u2019t think it makes you an AH. But I can see from her perspective why she isn\u2019t excited about the kids not having their own space. However, as a parent only seeing my kid one day a week wouldn\u2019t not work.

And I fail to see why this temporary living arrangement is inappropriate at all.  I couldn't think of any objection to it other than gender which is why I asked.", "It has nothing to do with gender. It may be unknown to you, but having adequate space -- including bedrooms -- for children is sometimes a factor in custody agreements. Many parents, regardless of gender, would prefer a home for their children that includes a bedroom that isn't shared with parents.", "Parental preferences are not determining factors to custody.  I'd prefer that when my daughters dad signs her up for softball that he doesn't quit taking her to it halfway through the season, but this isn't relevant in court.\n\nAlso, adequate space does not have to mean seperate bedrooms.  The only time bedrooms are required are foster children.  As long as the space is safe, the court won't fault him for seperate beds in a big room.  If this was true then parents could lose custody for co-sleeping, which they dont."]}
