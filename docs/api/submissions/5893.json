I move cities January 9th, I start my job January 16th. This is all happening very quickly but I have realised that I do need to put myself first and I am not an asshole for living my life, despite it being incredibly painful.\n\nMy boyfriend's mother does not agree. She is no longer speaking to me. I am not allowed to see my boyfriend, who I guess is no longer my boyfriend and hasn't been for 2 years. I knew this would happen so I said goodbye to him before I told her. I do not want to repeat what she said to me, however it was awful. She says I ruined Christmas because I made the decision on the 23rd but she knew this was possible and it was a time sensitive offer. As one commenter said, it was never going to be a good time to do this.\n\nOn the plus side, her hating me has made it so that I have to leave for this job. I have no ties here anymore.\n\nI may be the asshole in her eyes but this is what I need. I am having fleeting moments of regret but my family and therapist have said that in the 5 days since making this decision, I seem lighter.\n\nI am excited for this new chapter, thank you again for the kind comments.", "created_utc": 1672278752, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zxs6sz/update_wibta_for_moving_away_from_my_disabled/", "score": 637, "replies": ["Thank you for the update.\n\nYou've done nothing remotely wrong.", "You have done the right thing, and I'm so pleased to hear this update. Your boyfriend would not have wanted you to spend your life doing nothing, going nowhere, and not moving on, no matter what his mother says. I hope this is a beautiful new beginning for you.", "I think if I was in his position, I would rather my husband move on with his life instead of pinning over me and the life that could have been.\n\nI think anyone would want that for someone they really loved when they couldn't be in it anymore. \n\nYou're doing the right thing. Congratulations.", "Thanks for the update!  I'm glad you're going and choosing to live your life.\n\nIgnore what his mother said and hold your head up.  You've done nothing to feel badly about.", "You did the right thing. She is lashing out, not because of what you did, but because of how unfair life is. Whether you choose to forgive or not, she will need more time. \nGo, live your life. Go places and have adventures. I wish you a future love when you're ready, if that's your want. You know that was what he would have wanted for you, if he could make his wishes known. \nBe well, kiddo. I wish you all the best.", "I can only imagine how painful it must have been for you to make this decision. But you\u2019re a young woman with a whole life ahead of you to live. And maybe in some ways you can choose to live life to the fullest for the both of you since he sadly no longer can. Best wishes & good luck!", "Thanks for the update.  I think it stinks that she's refusing you access to him. And brilliant of you to have said goodbye to him first.  Best wishes in your new city & job!", "Be free knowing that your bf if he wasn\u2019t so badly hurt would be happy for you. I hope he is not suffering at all and is at rest in some way in that shell he is trapped in", "extremely happy for you, OP. you deserve this and either way it went, it probably would\u2019ve ended with her banning you from seeing your own boyfriend. regardless, do you and i wish you an amazing career moving forward!", "go get em tiger!", "Good luck out there. He would have w wanted you to thrive.", "If I were your bf I would want you to have a full and happy life. I would not want you to live your life paused. \n\nEmbrace life and remember what y\u2019all had. There are many ways to honor his love. Find a way to do this and move on.", "Appreciate the update. You are taking the right path here. Your BF's mother is grieving, upset and lashing out. No matter what you did, it would never get a positive reaction from her.", "That was such a tough position to be in, but I think you made the right decision.", "Good job! You are incredibly strong and I admire it. Sending good vibes:)", "Thank you for the update. I'm glad you were able to say goodbye. Best of luck to you.", "I am sorry you had to go through this but you definitely made the right decision. I wonder if at some level his mom is jealous because she doesn't feel like she can do the same thing. Either way, a relationship at this stage in your life is not a permanent binding commitment. This was going to have to happen eventually; this was the right time because of the job offer. As unfortunate as the mother's response is, at least it helps you make a relatively clean break of things.", "Happy cake day!", "You made the right choice.  Your boyfriend would support you 100% if he could. \n\nFrankly, his mother is irrational and behaving poorly.  If she had her way, you'd never leave his room.  I wouldn't be half-suprised if she asked you to jump into his funeral pyre one day.\n\nTLDR: Go live your best life for you and your boyfriend.  Don't die slowly for his mom.", "If I fell madly in love with someone and I died or was incapable of living, I would want them to go live their life. In fact, the best gift they could give me is to live their life as fully as possible - fulfill their dreams, take the adventures, love madly and deeply. I wish you as much!", "Congratulations.  You have definitely done the right thing, sad though it is. It\u2019s truly a sad situation but you are not married and will never be responsible for his well being.Heal and enjoy your new start.", "Good for you; you\u2019re doing the right thing. Keep in mind your BF\u2019s mother is most likely just lashing out; it\u2019s not you personally (that doesn\u2019t mean you need to maintain a relationship with her - just don\u2019t let what she says hurt you).", "In a way, she's helped you by making it a clean break. There's nothing easy about this for anybody and I'm sorry for her and you and your former boyfriend, and I wish you success and happiness.", "Thank you for the update. This is just a difficult chapter in your life. It will shape you and it will make you stronger. Honor your boyfriend for the strength that you have gained and he will want you to cherish the good memories you had together. Best wishes.", "I'm excited for you! I'm sorry things ended the way they did, but you deserve a life. Congrats on the new job!", "I'm sure he would have wished this for you.  I hope eventually his mom comes around and forgives you for making a positive choice for yourself.", "Good for you. Hopefully, his mother will realize that she was unfair to you but even if she doesn't, you are doing what's best for you. Good luck!", "You did the best you could, and I wish you all the best with the new chapter. \nJust a tip, since all this has happened, you might want some therapy or counseling to process this properly. \nBe kind to yourself!", "This is one of the nicest things I've read on reddit in half an age. Proud of you and wish you happiness for the future!", "You love your boyfriend, but he is no longer in this world, not really. He will understand. Cherish the memories you two made, and embrace the future with the knowledge that he will be proud of you.", "You did exactly the right thing imo. You can't stop living your life, and I highly doubt your boyfriend would have wanted you to.  Would you have wanted him to stop living his life had the circumstances been reversed? It's a terribly sad situation, but you did not do the wrong thing.", "Good luck, in the new city andd job,  bay-bay!  You made the right choice. It's  time to take care of you, and be happy.", "Congratulations on the new job!", "Best of luck <3", "I am so thankful you put yourself first. Good luck with everything you do. \u2764\ufe0f", "Thanks the the update.  Wishing you well on your new journey", "Congratulations! We are happy for you.", "You have done the right thing. You have your entire life to live. Good luck with the new job, and I hope you find much happiness.", "It's funny the expectations of men and women society has.  \n\n\nWhen a woman with a male partner/husband is diagnosed with cancer one of the regular things medical professionals council them on is to be mentally prepared that their partner will leave. Apparently in the US more than 2/3rds of men leave.  \n\n\nHere unfortunately your bf of a couple of years is not even able to interact with you and you are expected by his mother (and pressure yourself to do this too!) to give up your young life in your early 20s and not make ANY progress. She is worried you are MOVING ON WITH YOUR LIFE when he can't be present in it which would be mad if you were 50 let alone early 20s at the time of the accident.  \n\n\nObviously she is heartbroken for her child, but you are also someone's child.  \n\n\nThe kindest thing she has done to date is not allow you to see him to give you a clean break.  \n\n\nI wish you all the best with your new future full of life - please get some therapy to deal with the guilt I suspect you will feel.   \n\n\nLovely update x", "It sucks all around.  You definitely did abandon him.  No way around it.   But at the same time it's unreasonable for you to be expected to stick around.   Life can definitely be extremely cruel to some people.", "Came to say exactly this. I understand mom is hurt, but she is selfish to expect OP to die inside too.", "I actually think it's for the best OP doesn't have access. It helps OP move on easier and truthfully she has no more right to see him anymore since the relationship is over", "PS i know her words hurt, but please know they are rooted in her own deep pain which we could never understand. Don\u2019t carry the burden of her anger, but feel free to forgive her."]}
