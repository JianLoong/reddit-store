I move cities January 9th, I start my job January 16th. This is all happening very quickly but I have realised that I do need to put myself first and I am not an asshole for living my life, despite it being incredibly painful.\n\nMy boyfriend's mother does not agree. She is no longer speaking to me. I am not allowed to see my boyfriend, who I guess is no longer my boyfriend and hasn't been for 2 years. I knew this would happen so I said goodbye to him before I told her. I do not want to repeat what she said to me, however it was awful. She says I ruined Christmas because I made the decision on the 23rd but she knew this was possible and it was a time sensitive offer. As one commenter said, it was never going to be a good time to do this.\n\nOn the plus side, her hating me has made it so that I have to leave for this job. I have no ties here anymore.\n\nI may be the asshole in her eyes but this is what I need. I am having fleeting moments of regret but my family and therapist have said that in the 5 days since making this decision, I seem lighter.\n\nI am excited for this new chapter, thank you again for the kind comments.", "created_utc": 1672278752, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zxs6sz/update_wibta_for_moving_away_from_my_disabled/", "score": 1738, "replies": ["Thank you for the update.\n\nYou've done nothing remotely wrong.", "You have done the right thing, and I'm so pleased to hear this update. Your boyfriend would not have wanted you to spend your life doing nothing, going nowhere, and not moving on, no matter what his mother says. I hope this is a beautiful new beginning for you.", "I think if I was in his position, I would rather my husband move on with his life instead of pinning over me and the life that could have been.\n\nI think anyone would want that for someone they really loved when they couldn't be in it anymore. \n\nYou're doing the right thing. Congratulations.", "Thanks for the update!  I'm glad you're going and choosing to live your life.\n\nIgnore what his mother said and hold your head up.  You've done nothing to feel badly about.", "You did the right thing. She is lashing out, not because of what you did, but because of how unfair life is. Whether you choose to forgive or not, she will need more time. \nGo, live your life. Go places and have adventures. I wish you a future love when you're ready, if that's your want. You know that was what he would have wanted for you, if he could make his wishes known. \nBe well, kiddo. I wish you all the best.", "I can only imagine how painful it must have been for you to make this decision. But you\u2019re a young woman with a whole life ahead of you to live. And maybe in some ways you can choose to live life to the fullest for the both of you since he sadly no longer can. Best wishes & good luck!", "Thanks for the update.  I think it stinks that she's refusing you access to him. And brilliant of you to have said goodbye to him first.  Best wishes in your new city & job!", "Be free knowing that your bf if he wasn\u2019t so badly hurt would be happy for you. I hope he is not suffering at all and is at rest in some way in that shell he is trapped in", "extremely happy for you, OP. you deserve this and either way it went, it probably would\u2019ve ended with her banning you from seeing your own boyfriend. regardless, do you and i wish you an amazing career moving forward!", "go get em tiger!", "Good luck out there. He would have w wanted you to thrive.", "If I were your bf I would want you to have a full and happy life. I would not want you to live your life paused. \n\nEmbrace life and remember what y\u2019all had. There are many ways to honor his love. Find a way to do this and move on.", "Appreciate the update. You are taking the right path here. Your BF's mother is grieving, upset and lashing out. No matter what you did, it would never get a positive reaction from her.", "That was such a tough position to be in, but I think you made the right decision.", "Good job! You are incredibly strong and I admire it. Sending good vibes:)", "Thank you for the update. I'm glad you were able to say goodbye. Best of luck to you.", "I am sorry you had to go through this but you definitely made the right decision. I wonder if at some level his mom is jealous because she doesn't feel like she can do the same thing. Either way, a relationship at this stage in your life is not a permanent binding commitment. This was going to have to happen eventually; this was the right time because of the job offer. As unfortunate as the mother's response is, at least it helps you make a relatively clean break of things.", "Happy cake day!", "You made the right choice.  Your boyfriend would support you 100% if he could. \n\nFrankly, his mother is irrational and behaving poorly.  If she had her way, you'd never leave his room.  I wouldn't be half-suprised if she asked you to jump into his funeral pyre one day.\n\nTLDR: Go live your best life for you and your boyfriend.  Don't die slowly for his mom.", "If I fell madly in love with someone and I died or was incapable of living, I would want them to go live their life. In fact, the best gift they could give me is to live their life as fully as possible - fulfill their dreams, take the adventures, love madly and deeply. I wish you as much!", "Congratulations.  You have definitely done the right thing, sad though it is. It\u2019s truly a sad situation but you are not married and will never be responsible for his well being.Heal and enjoy your new start.", "Good for you; you\u2019re doing the right thing. Keep in mind your BF\u2019s mother is most likely just lashing out; it\u2019s not you personally (that doesn\u2019t mean you need to maintain a relationship with her - just don\u2019t let what she says hurt you).", "In a way, she's helped you by making it a clean break. There's nothing easy about this for anybody and I'm sorry for her and you and your former boyfriend, and I wish you success and happiness.", "Thank you for the update. This is just a difficult chapter in your life. It will shape you and it will make you stronger. Honor your boyfriend for the strength that you have gained and he will want you to cherish the good memories you had together. Best wishes.", "I'm excited for you! I'm sorry things ended the way they did, but you deserve a life. Congrats on the new job!", "I'm sure he would have wished this for you.  I hope eventually his mom comes around and forgives you for making a positive choice for yourself.", "Good for you. Hopefully, his mother will realize that she was unfair to you but even if she doesn't, you are doing what's best for you. Good luck!", "You did the best you could, and I wish you all the best with the new chapter. \nJust a tip, since all this has happened, you might want some therapy or counseling to process this properly. \nBe kind to yourself!", "This is one of the nicest things I've read on reddit in half an age. Proud of you and wish you happiness for the future!", "You love your boyfriend, but he is no longer in this world, not really. He will understand. Cherish the memories you two made, and embrace the future with the knowledge that he will be proud of you.", "You did exactly the right thing imo. You can't stop living your life, and I highly doubt your boyfriend would have wanted you to.  Would you have wanted him to stop living his life had the circumstances been reversed? It's a terribly sad situation, but you did not do the wrong thing.", "Good luck, in the new city andd job,  bay-bay!  You made the right choice. It's  time to take care of you, and be happy.", "Congratulations on the new job!", "Best of luck <3", "I am so thankful you put yourself first. Good luck with everything you do. \u2764\ufe0f", "Thanks the the update.  Wishing you well on your new journey", "Congratulations! We are happy for you.", "You have done the right thing. You have your entire life to live. Good luck with the new job, and I hope you find much happiness.", "It's funny the expectations of men and women society has.  \n\n\nWhen a woman with a male partner/husband is diagnosed with cancer one of the regular things medical professionals council them on is to be mentally prepared that their partner will leave. Apparently in the US more than 2/3rds of men leave.  \n\n\nHere unfortunately your bf of a couple of years is not even able to interact with you and you are expected by his mother (and pressure yourself to do this too!) to give up your young life in your early 20s and not make ANY progress. She is worried you are MOVING ON WITH YOUR LIFE when he can't be present in it which would be mad if you were 50 let alone early 20s at the time of the accident.  \n\n\nObviously she is heartbroken for her child, but you are also someone's child.  \n\n\nThe kindest thing she has done to date is not allow you to see him to give you a clean break.  \n\n\nI wish you all the best with your new future full of life - please get some therapy to deal with the guilt I suspect you will feel.   \n\n\nLovely update x", "[deleted]", "Came to say exactly this. I understand mom is hurt, but she is selfish to expect OP to die inside too.", "I actually think it's for the best OP doesn't have access. It helps OP move on easier and truthfully she has no more right to see him anymore since the relationship is over", "PS i know her words hurt, but please know they are rooted in her own deep pain which we could never understand. Don\u2019t carry the burden of her anger, but feel free to forgive her.", "Good luck with your new job!", "This makes me happy.\n\nIf I were your [ex] bf, I wouldn't want you to stop living just because I did.", "Thank you for the update! Congratulations on your new job! Sending you warm wishes for your future!", "NTA. Enjoy the new chapter in your life.", "I am so glad you are going to do this! If he wouldn\u2019t have wanted you to move on then he wouldn\u2019t have been the one anyway. But most likely he doesn\u2019t want you stay behind for him and put your life on hold. May I suggest that maybe his mom is upset because she possibly feels stuck herself? As a parent, if everything fails in your kids life the expectation falls on you completely as their parent to care for them. It\u2019s a hard place to be put in but no one\u2019s fault. Congratulations on your new job! Take care of yourself.", "I\u2019m really happy for you. You did nothing wrong and are a very kind person who cares deeply about people.", "Happy that you put yourself first.\n\nCongrats on starting a new chapter in life!", "If I were your ex, I would want you to move on and have a life. You're doing the right thing, even if it feels hard or conflicting right now. I'm proud of you. Good luck in your new job! \ud83d\udc9c", "Thank you for sharing your update. Congratulations on the new job and the move. \n\nMajor transitions can be so hard, especially when you\u2019re still young, and you\u2019re making a few at the same time! Keep on top of your self care, stay in touch with your friends and family who are understanding and supportive, and keep your therapist or get a new one in your new city. \n\nAlso allow yourself space to grieve, which may come up unexpectedly. You are accepting that the life you expected is going to be different now, which is a positive step. But it\u2019s also okay to have some time to be sad about the changes. And it\u2019s also okay if you\u2019re not that sad as you start your next chapter. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve had more than your share of sadness the last few years.", "Good decision. x", "You have been through a lot and it took great courage to make the decision. Good luck to you in your new role. I wish you much happiness in the future!", "I wish you nothing but happiness. I\u2019m sorry that you went through that and know that if your boyfriend loved you the way you loved him then he would want this for you too.", "I strongly believe that this is the right decision. You can't be tied down by something that isn't even the person you love", "Thank you for your update,\n\nYour initial post was really heart breaking to read, but I know if I was in your bf shoes I wouldn't want my partner to put their life on hold indefinitely.\n\nYou are never going to be a good person to your mil, she will forever see the person who gets to go on and live their life, while her son slowly passes in hospital.\n\nYour done made the right decision, I wish you the absolute best for the future \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "Congratulations on restarting your life. I\u2019m sure your boyfriend understands and is proud of you.", "Congratulations. You did nothing wrong. You ruined nothing. You deserve to live and love. You can still love your boyfriend/ex\u2026 but choose to move on. He\u2019s not capable of a healthy relationship with you anyways\u2026 he can\u2019t even consent to marriage, children, etc. you\u2019re a good person. It\u2019s okay to have empathy but love yourself! Best wishes\n\nPS- his mom is selfish and should be taking care of her son.", "You did the right thing and I wish you well on your new journey.", "Congratulation and best of luck for your new life! You absolutely deserve it after all that you have been through.", "I'm so thrilled for you, OP! I think about your post sometimes so it was a relief to see the update and your final decision. I'm so sorry his mom, however predictably, treated you poorly - but now that's behind you and there's so much ahead. Good luck with the move and living your best life!", "Live. Love. Laugh.\nDo all 3 and you will have no regrets.\n\nYou are doing all 3.  Good for you!", "I so support you. I started dating my boyfriend long after his accident and he\u2019s a quadriplegic. He\u2019s still there, his body\u2019s just different. Way different situation, so while I feel like I hold your post close to my heart, I definitely understand that our situations are definitely not the same.  \n\nI\u2019m so proud of you for continuing to live your life! If you both loved each other like you say, I\u2019m sure he would want that for you. You owe it to yourself to put yourself first. It doesn\u2019t mean what you had wasn\u2019t really and that you won\u2019t cherish it forever.", "I am so proud of you for putting your own future first. You didnt take vows (despite planning to), and even if you had, this kind of thing supercedes vows. If your partner loved you as much as you love him, he would have been encouraging you to take this opportunity. I think he might have been doing just that from whatever place he's found himself.\n\nYou did the right thing, OP. You're going to have a beautiful life and I'm proud of you", "I think if your boyfriend had truly loved you he would have wanted you to be happy and have a full life. Congratulations.", "congrats on accepting the new job.  you need to move on with your life and I hope moving helps.", "Good luck \ud83d\udc9c", "Congratulations on your new job! As everyone is saying, you are right to move on. You deserve a full life, and that includes falling in love again. Your boyfriend would have wanted you to. I also came to say that I think your boyfriend's mom feels some guilt because he was injured skiing, and I'm probably assuming it was at their family's resort. She is possibly beating herself up, saying if they didn't own a ski resort, he would still be the person he used to be.  You moving on is a reminder that he won't be; that he won't be getting married, having a family, doing all the things she dreamt about while he was growing up. He will be as he is now unless she lets go. It is very sad no matter how you look at it. Please don't second guess yourself. You will still have doubts off and on, and that is okay. It doesn't mean you made the wrong decision. Allow yourself to continue to grieve your boyfriend and the life you thought you were going to have with him. Eventually, you will meet someone new and you will love again. You may feel guilty, but that doesn't mean you didn't love your boyfriend. It just means you are moving on. Just remind yourself that he would have wanted you to be happy and loved. Take care of yourself, and thank you for the update.", "Congratulations on the new job!", "If your boyfriend could, he probably would have told you to go for the job OP. Living your life does not mean you didn't love him. I'm sorry his mother doesn't see that.", "Congrats on moving forward with your life, after a horrible tragedy. It's completely unreasonable to expect you to put your life on hold forever.", "Congratulations on the job.\n\nWhilst your choice was incredibly difficult, I think you\u2019ve made the right one. Good luck with your future.", "I\u2019m so happy for your new beginning \ud83d\ude4c", "Staying with someone who's been comatose for 2 years is heroic.  I 100% agree with your choice and am somewhat glad the mom made it an easier decision for you.    \n\nBest of luck in your new job and the new chapter in your life.", "Human behavior is a weird contradictory thing.\n\nYou having the perspective and courage to continue living your life may eventually be what she needs to also gain the perspective and courage to continue living her life as well.\n\nI'm sure he would want the best for both of you.", "Seems like this was a reason to leave him...But anyways.", "THIS RIGHT HERE. I know 100% if I were in BF shoes, I'd absolutely want OP to move on and be happy.  Congrats OP, best wishes in starting a new chapter in your life!", "This exactly. For BF's mom, OP moving on is another sign that he isn't coming back, and clearly she's not coping well with this. But to expect OP to give up her future and all the bright days that could be ahead of her is deeply unfair, and also the last thing OP's boyfriend would want if he truly loved her - no-one would want that for someone they love. \n\nOP your BF was - and is - very lucky to have someone who loves him so deeply. But he can't be a part of your future, so you need to make your own now. All the very best to you as you set out on it.", "Good luck, OP, you deserve happiness and I\u2019m certain it\u2019s what he would\u2019ve wanted.", "Happy cake day!", "How many people stick with a partner they found in their 20s forever? They weren't married. Break ups happen. Relationships end because one party has to move for work all the time. One party being in an accident doesn't change that. Ending a relationship and moving for work can in no way be called abandonment. No law or court order declared OP his guardian.", "I suspect that it also has to do with wanting the op ready to be his carer after them or to take over the carer duties. I would not be surprised if that was the mother's long term goal", "Grief does strange things to us. Her moving on is a signal to the mother that the world is going on without her son, which is hard for grieving parents to accept. My own mom has been through this with every life milestone I go through, due to us losing my sister about a decade ago.\n\nOP is still making the right decision by allowing herself to move forward, and her empathetic heart is wonderfully strong. I wish her all the best as she lives her life for herself.", "I deleted my comment, but I did say that it was an unfortunate situation and that it was unreasonable to expect her to say.   But in truth, you really are just leaving your boyfriend (ex) with no other support system but his mom.   We're not talking about courts or legalities, we're talking about leaving this human behind for a better opportunity at life.   It makes sense from her end, but you are unequivocally abandoning him.   She knows it, that's why she felt the guilt.  I'm downvoted because people are emotional, and again it's understandable.    \n\nIf Me and my partner are running away from a Bear, and she trips and falls, and I keep running, I am most certainly abandoning her to suffer her fate at the hands of the bear.   Now it's completely understandable on my part because there's little I can do against a full grown bear, but that still doesn't change the fact that I am abandoning her.   I'm use to Reddit, so I don't normally mind the downvotes but it seemed pointless for my comment to stick out like a sore thumb so I had just deleted it.   \n\nBut I just couldn't help replying to you :)", "She's not abandoning her boyfriend, because her boyfriend isn't there anymore. He is not conscious and will never recover. He essentially died two years ago. He's nothing more than a leftover husk at this point."]}
