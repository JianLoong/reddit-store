I move cities January 9th, I start my job January 16th. This is all happening very quickly but I have realised that I do need to put myself first and I am not an asshole for living my life, despite it being incredibly painful.\n\nMy boyfriend's mother does not agree. She is no longer speaking to me. I am not allowed to see my boyfriend, who I guess is no longer my boyfriend and hasn't been for 2 years. I knew this would happen so I said goodbye to him before I told her. I do not want to repeat what she said to me, however it was awful. She says I ruined Christmas because I made the decision on the 23rd but she knew this was possible and it was a time sensitive offer. As one commenter said, it was never going to be a good time to do this.\n\nOn the plus side, her hating me has made it so that I have to leave for this job. I have no ties here anymore.\n\nI may be the asshole in her eyes but this is what I need. I am having fleeting moments of regret but my family and therapist have said that in the 5 days since making this decision, I seem lighter.\n\nI am excited for this new chapter, thank you again for the kind comments.", "created_utc": 1672278752, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zxs6sz/update_wibta_for_moving_away_from_my_disabled/", "score": 91, "replies": ["Thank you for the update.\n\nYou've done nothing remotely wrong.", "You have done the right thing, and I'm so pleased to hear this update. Your boyfriend would not have wanted you to spend your life doing nothing, going nowhere, and not moving on, no matter what his mother says. I hope this is a beautiful new beginning for you.", "I think if I was in his position, I would rather my husband move on with his life instead of pinning over me and the life that could have been.\n\nI think anyone would want that for someone they really loved when they couldn't be in it anymore. \n\nYou're doing the right thing. Congratulations.", "Thanks for the update!  I'm glad you're going and choosing to live your life.\n\nIgnore what his mother said and hold your head up.  You've done nothing to feel badly about.", "You did the right thing. She is lashing out, not because of what you did, but because of how unfair life is. Whether you choose to forgive or not, she will need more time. \nGo, live your life. Go places and have adventures. I wish you a future love when you're ready, if that's your want. You know that was what he would have wanted for you, if he could make his wishes known. \nBe well, kiddo. I wish you all the best.", "I can only imagine how painful it must have been for you to make this decision. But you\u2019re a young woman with a whole life ahead of you to live. And maybe in some ways you can choose to live life to the fullest for the both of you since he sadly no longer can. Best wishes & good luck!", "Thanks for the update.  I think it stinks that she's refusing you access to him. And brilliant of you to have said goodbye to him first.  Best wishes in your new city & job!", "Be free knowing that your bf if he wasn\u2019t so badly hurt would be happy for you. I hope he is not suffering at all and is at rest in some way in that shell he is trapped in", "extremely happy for you, OP. you deserve this and either way it went, it probably would\u2019ve ended with her banning you from seeing your own boyfriend. regardless, do you and i wish you an amazing career moving forward!", "go get em tiger!", "Good luck out there. He would have w wanted you to thrive.", "If I were your bf I would want you to have a full and happy life. I would not want you to live your life paused. \n\nEmbrace life and remember what y\u2019all had. There are many ways to honor his love. Find a way to do this and move on.", "Appreciate the update. You are taking the right path here. Your BF's mother is grieving, upset and lashing out. No matter what you did, it would never get a positive reaction from her.", "That was such a tough position to be in, but I think you made the right decision.", "Good job! You are incredibly strong and I admire it. Sending good vibes:)", "Thank you for the update. I'm glad you were able to say goodbye. Best of luck to you.", "I am sorry you had to go through this but you definitely made the right decision. I wonder if at some level his mom is jealous because she doesn't feel like she can do the same thing. Either way, a relationship at this stage in your life is not a permanent binding commitment. This was going to have to happen eventually; this was the right time because of the job offer. As unfortunate as the mother's response is, at least it helps you make a relatively clean break of things.", "Happy cake day!"]}
