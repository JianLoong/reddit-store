Since then, dinners are ready on time, everyone praises and repeats the dish (not very common).\n\n It's 1-2 day for preparing meals. I don't ask them to help me, because I know I'm serious with organization, but if the person wants to, I ask them to respect the process. \n\nAnother fact: my mother was a cook (for 1 year) and my SIL is studying gastronomy. \n\nThe situation:\n\nSunday was the half-yearly dinner and I was  the head as usual. Would help me: my SIL, mother, aunt and uncle. This would be SIL's first family dinner and she offered to help. \n\nDuring the preparation, my mother started to do several things wrong and every time I said something, she said something like \"Stay calm, a wrong thing will not lead to anything\". \n\nThe problem is that she did so much wrong, skipping so many NECESSARY steps in the food that most things I had to redo or give a second look. She continued to help even though I said it wasn't necessary.\n\n I broke down when I just commented something about steps with my SIL and she corrected me, I was going to comment but my mother said \"I think you better cool off in the pool and let those with experience sort it out\".\n\n I accepted, grabbed a glass of wine, the spreassheet with me and spent the whole day in the pool, ignoring when asked to come back. \n\nSo... Dinner was late, poorly seasoned, undercooked and no one had a second dish. \n\nMy mother later said that I ruined dinner and humiliated our family in front of relatives in revenge.

I don't have the experience or the skill set to make dinners your way, so, at that point, the only thing I could do was to get out of your way. I certainly wasn't thinking about revenge, but I don't see the point in continuing to discuss it -- it's the past, so let's leave it in the past and not point fingers.

It's one of the more annoying things when someone wants you to take responsibility for a project, but also insists that you do it in their style.

And that's exactly what your mom did to you", "NTA.  The mom kicked OP out of the kitchen because she was trying to impress her new daughter-in-law. Then when it went wrong she blamed OP instead of taking responsibility. \n\nI half think mom was low key bullying OP to impress her new guests.", "NTA. Always do exactly what people ask, because then they can only blame themselves for the result, lol. I thought they had such experience, that you can just chill by the pool?", "NTA.  Sounds like they all just volunteered to cook the (shitty) biannual meal from now on.", "NTA.  They wanted to cook and ruined the meal.  Not your fault or your problem.  Maybe you should stop cooking those meals since they don't seem to appreciate your effort.", "NTA but tell people you don\u2019t want help in the future.

OP has clearly put in a lot of work to make these large family dinners run smoother and taste better. As they say everyone is happier with the food after OP took charge. That is an act of service to make their family happy. Food being late and not appetizing usually leads to an awkward atmosphere, the point of a family dinner is food AND family. Also if family is important why is it justified for OPs mom to be extremely rude to them? Why not put the onus on mom to not be mean rather than on OP to grin and bear it? If she thought OP was being too controlling maybe it would be more appropriate to discuss it after dinner.\nEdit: I accidentally switched food and family in the first sentence lol", "\u201cI think you better cool off in the pool and let those with EXPERIENCE sort it out.\u201d So if they have the experience, how did you ruin it?

It seems they can\u2019t have it both ways.", "NTA It sounds like it was very clear what you needed if you were to cook dinner. You had no obligation to cook the dinner. They could not abide by that, which is fine, but that means they own it.", "NTA.\n\nI understand that some people would be annoyed by you're rigorous procedures, but when it comes to things like this the should just stay quiet and enjoy the fact someone is putting down so much work and pride to serve the entire family.\n\nHopefully they learned a lesson, just be firm you don't want help in the future.", "NTA.

If they want you to continue to do it, then they will stay out of the kitchen and if they come in and 'help' you will walk out and let them handle it.
