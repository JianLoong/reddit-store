Since then, dinners are ready on time, everyone praises and repeats the dish (not very common).\n\n It's 1-2 day for preparing meals. I don't ask them to help me, because I know I'm serious with organization, but if the person wants to, I ask them to respect the process. \n\nAnother fact: my mother was a cook (for 1 year) and my SIL is studying gastronomy. \n\nThe situation:\n\nSunday was the half-yearly dinner and I was  the head as usual. Would help me: my SIL, mother, aunt and uncle. This would be SIL's first family dinner and she offered to help. \n\nDuring the preparation, my mother started to do several things wrong and every time I said something, she said something like \"Stay calm, a wrong thing will not lead to anything\". \n\nThe problem is that she did so much wrong, skipping so many NECESSARY steps in the food that most things I had to redo or give a second look. She continued to help even though I said it wasn't necessary.\n\n I broke down when I just commented something about steps with my SIL and she corrected me, I was going to comment but my mother said \"I think you better cool off in the pool and let those with experience sort it out\".\n\n I accepted, grabbed a glass of wine, the spreassheet with me and spent the whole day in the pool, ignoring when asked to come back. \n\nSo... Dinner was late, poorly seasoned, undercooked and no one had a second dish. \n\nMy mother later said that I ruined dinner and humiliated our family in front of relatives in revenge. I shouldn't take that serious, because it was a silly family joke. \n\nBtw, I love making these dinners, and yes, my mother's SIL behavior is common. \n\nAITA?\n\nSomeone asked for examples of what she did wrong: she put too much salt on one of the meats and it was inedible. There had to be 10 of something for the food and she cut it in half because it was too much (it wasn't). She started to make rice very early, and we use the pan first for other food and the rice is last because it is the biggest and heaviest pan. \n\nMy spread sheet basically has the amounts and how long each cooking ingredient goes. \n\nI point out when they get the quantities wrong (too much or too little) or when they start making food that is for a long time before or after.", "created_utc": 1685658155, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13xv94d/aita_for_accepting_the_suggestion_and_not_coming/", "score": 6759, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't have the experience or the skill set to make dinners your way, so, at that point, the only thing I could do was to get out of your way. I certainly wasn't thinking about revenge, but I don't see the point in continuing to discuss it -- it's the past, so let's leave it in the past and not point fingers.

It's one of the more annoying things when someone wants you to take responsibility for a project, but also insists that you do it in their style.

And that's exactly what your mom did to you", "NTA.  The mom kicked OP out of the kitchen because she was trying to impress her new daughter-in-law. Then when it went wrong she blamed OP instead of taking responsibility. \n\nI half think mom was low key bullying OP to impress her new guests.", "NTA. Always do exactly what people ask, because then they can only blame themselves for the result, lol. I thought they had such experience, that you can just chill by the pool?", "NTA.  Sounds like they all just volunteered to cook the (shitty) biannual meal from now on.", "NTA.  They wanted to cook and ruined the meal.  Not your fault or your problem.  Maybe you should stop cooking those meals since they don't seem to appreciate your effort.", "NTA but tell people you don\u2019t want help in the future.

OP has clearly put in a lot of work to make these large family dinners run smoother and taste better. As they say everyone is happier with the food after OP took charge. That is an act of service to make their family happy. Food being late and not appetizing usually leads to an awkward atmosphere, the point of a family dinner is food AND family. Also if family is important why is it justified for OPs mom to be extremely rude to them? Why not put the onus on mom to not be mean rather than on OP to grin and bear it? If she thought OP was being too controlling maybe it would be more appropriate to discuss it after dinner.\nEdit: I accidentally switched food and family in the first sentence lol", "\u201cI think you better cool off in the pool and let those with EXPERIENCE sort it out.\u201d So if they have the experience, how did you ruin it?

It seems they can\u2019t have it both ways.", "NTA It sounds like it was very clear what you needed if you were to cook dinner. You had no obligation to cook the dinner. They could not abide by that, which is fine, but that means they own it.", "NTA.\n\nI understand that some people would be annoyed by your rigorous procedures, but when it comes to things like this they should just stay quiet and enjoy the fact someone is putting down so much work and pride to serve the entire family.\n\nHopefully they learned a lesson, just be firm you don't want help in the future.", "NTA.

I realize it\u2019s a lot of people so obviously cooking for 30 is a lot to do in your average kitchen and it\u2019s good to have a system and some organization to keep things on track\u2026 that said it sounded like your SIL was just trying to be helpful being new to the family and she got steamrolled for it. Your mom does sound like she was being rude with the \u201clet people with EXPERIENCE handle it\u201d but she was probably right to call you out on getting probably way too intense or upset over dinner prep. Because worst case here seems to be food was blah and like\u2026 sounds like my average bland palate family\u2019s regular dinners lol. \n\nI respect wanting to make a nice meal for everyone, but if you do these things twice a year, it might be better to try and dial down the intensity of the meal plan or maybe just all throw in and order pizza or something.

It sounds like in the future you should either do the work yourself so you know it\u2019s done right (knowing it\u2019ll take extra time) or switch to a potluck-style gathering so everyone can bring a dish and not put so much stress on the chef.", "Sorry, but YTA. Next time, just stick to the mashed potatoes and avoid the family drama.", "ESH. Either there is agreement you are in charge, or there isn't. \n\nMany families enjoy the experience of cooking together, so I have some sympathy for the people who aren't as good as you at cooking, but still want to be included in the shared experience.   \n\nOn the other hand, if there is agreement you are in charge, then they need to listen to what you want done. \n\nQuite possibly different members of your family might view this experience differently.  It seems that for you, the important thing is the quality and delivery of the food. For other people it might be more about bonding and sharing work.", "I\u2019m in the minority here. I feel ETA\n\nMy mother used to make Xmas dinner for her whole side of the family. No exaggeration we had 45 people on average. One year it was 56. It would mean people taking turns at two big tables and serving 2-3 times. Having to make more potatoes and vegetables while one table was eating. She\u2019s never needed to use a spreadsheet. That whole thing to me is super weird. Like a touch over controlling. \n\nThe food was always great (maybe that\u2019s the difference). But the whole point was for the whole family to get together and catch up on each other\u2019s lives. Eating was secondary. If it was late a bit no one ever complained. \n\nSo to me YTA for making it into so much more than it should be. And your mom is an ass for making comments and taking over when she clearly didn\u2019t know what she was doing. \n\nThis whole thing to me seems like a mess that only revolves around you and your mom\u2019s egos. \n\nThen yet again I\u2019m Canadian and we don\u2019t have the same culture as you Americans seem to have. So what do I know. This is my point of view anyways.", "Someone can be *right* and an *asshole*\n\nOp, I respect your decision and fully support standing your ground and not letting the others give you shit.

You poured stormed off and took your toys (the spreadsheet) with you . Leaving the spreadsheet would have further validated your methods but no, you let your ego get in the way.

The mom asked them to come back into the kitchen to prepare the dinner and chose to be petty. To me, it'd be completely different if the dinner was just for the people in the kitchen who, directly or indirectly, were part of what happened. None of the other people deserved to have a bad dinner, that OP was in charge of, all because OP wanted to prove a petty point to their mom.\n\nMalicious compliance is fine and feels great when the only \"victim\" is the person who imposed the instructions that worked against them.
