We are mid 20s. Just the beginning of this week I got an urgent call from him twice telling me to answer my phone. I finally answer my phone and he\u2019s angry that our child is possibly getting \u201chands, foot, and mouth\u201d disease.  \n\nBasically to rewind time just a week before that my little brother who happens to live in the same household as my child and I had caught it at school from teammates. I had ended up telling my ex this just to let him know and keep him in the loop.\n\n Now fast forward to this week it was his time to get her, he usually gets her once a week and I have her the remainder days due to him working a lot of hours. So he calls me being pissed that our child is getting sick pretty much blaming me making it seem like I didn\u2019t take the necessary precautions to keep her from getting sick. Even tho I made sure to not be around my brother and Clorox wipe down everything he might of touched and used alot of hand sanitizer on our hands. I told him that I was trying and he proceeded to say he doesn\u2019t want to put her back in this house to endanger her with this disease since my brother is here. I said if she is sick already then it wouldn\u2019t matter if she is here or there because she is already sick and that my brother is better now and back to school. We end up arguing and the fact that he works so much means he wouldn\u2019t have been able to take care of her there and he would\u2019ve ended up trying to pawn her off to someone else in his family. I left it at that as I had to work so I got back to him later on that night as it would\u2019ve been time for him to drop her off.\nI call him and say \u201cAre you going to bring her back at the time we agree on or should I just come and pick her up\u201d He ignores my question to then argue some more with me so I finally said okay I will just pick her up then to he replies with a \u201c bet I won\u2019t answer\u201d so I said okay so if you don\u2019t bring her back at said time I will call the police.\nNow he\u2019s mad at me, can\u2019t look at me the same says I\u2019m evil, etc and is now threatening full custody and that if he gets it I\u2019ll never hear from him again which means I\u2019d never hear from my child again. Now I\u2019m wondering if I overreacted and was a bit harsh on threatening to call the cops on him ?\n\nEDIT: I wanted to make an edit as a few people in the comments mentioned our custody. As of right now we don\u2019t have a custody case through court yet. We have a child support hearing next month as they went after him since I\u2019m on assistance. Don\u2019t mean to come off as confusing with our custody scheduling.\n\nEDIT: I wanted to make another edit thanking the people in the comment section giving me advice on how to navigate this situation esp with the court custody scheduling part as it\u2019s all still new to me I haven\u2019t had to deal with any of it until now. I\u2019ve been trying to read more on it to get more informed. I appreciate you guys. It looks like child support and custody are two different situations so I\u2019ll have to work on the custody thing separately to get a custody case going.", "created_utc": 1697709513, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17bfiel/aita_for_threatening_to_call_the_cops_on_my/", "score": 376, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You warned him that if he did such a thing, you would call the police. He's breaking the custody agreement, so the police will be on your side, and his doing that will likely prevent him from winning full custody of your child. In fact, at this point there's a good chance that a judge would award you scheduled visitation for your ex with your child. He'd no longer have the ability to threaten you with such nonsense. Just because he doesn't understand how she got sick and how it wasn't anything to do with your ability to properly care for your child, doesn't mean that a judge is going to agree with his faulty conclusion. And even if he was to get full custody, all you'd have to do is mention his threats and the court would make sure he understands that if he leaves with your child without permission, he would be brought up on charges of kidnapping. He can't legally keep you from seeing your child, full custody or not.", "NTA, it's not harsh to threaten to call the police when your ex isn't abiding by your custody agreement.

It's not a disease you get from lack of cleanliness, it's a viral infection and a pretty virulent one at that.\n\nAlso, if you have a designated time and place to pick up your child, you need to be there to pick up your child. Whether he is there with your child or not. Then you need to put it in your notebook that he was there or not. If he's not there, but he's always been there before. You should call him first. If he won't answer then you should call the police, because what he's done is kidnapping at that point. He's not authorized to have your child then, because you were supposed to make the hand off.

Id say talk to him if hes usually reasonable and agreeable. Tell him youre sorry you made the police threat but you felt backed into a corner, and that you arent trying to keep her from him but his work makes it hard. If youre comfortable with it, let him have her a few extra days so he has a little faith in you and this doesnt happen again. Next time someone is sick and you wanna protect her, see if he wants to take his time early. \n\nIf you cant work with him then no worries and stick to what you gotta do obviously, but there could be another approach to this too", "You two need couples counselling. It is possible to co-parent as separated parents without having a screaming match.\n\nESH In a situation like this ideally your ex would take your daughter as soon as everyone knows that there is a contagious disease in the house.

So I d go NAH because I understand OPs' point but I understand also father who doesn't want his kid to be in place where kid can possibly get sick, seriously sick for 2 y.o.", "Absolutely keep correspondence. Only communicate via text or record your phone calls if that is legal in your area.", "[removed]", "Yep. For anything not written or VM, keep a journal with dated entries.", "OP doesn\u2019t mention a legal custody agreement\u2026 \n\nOP is NTA either way but if they have not gone to court to get one she 100% needs to, in some places if there isn\u2019t a legal custody agreement in place either parent, that are on the birth certificate, can withhold the child without immediate consequences (there can be long term consequences) and the police may not be able to get involved.", "Thank you, will do", "That\u2019s what I worry about now so when he picks her up I\u2019m going to worry that he will try to do that next time . The full custody part and the other parts are in text messages he sent to me out of anger.", "I don\u2019t have one yet, we have a child support hearing next month so I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s when they will do one?", "That\u2019s what my mom thinks is this is all about child support as we were fine up until he learned he had to pay and everything kinda went a little bit down hill.", "Yeah he\u2019s already threatened cps through messages amongst other threats he has made to me. So I\u2019m usually on it with keeping the house clean and well, especially because my child likes to trash the house with her toys lol and I\u2019m always following behind her cleaning up.", "Yeah I\u2019ll add it in the edits . Didn\u2019t realize that .", "I don\u2019t think he\u2019s a threat to her safety I do feel at times he comes off as overly controlling more in a \u201cwhat I say goes \u201c and doesn\u2019t much let me have a say since she both our child but I do think in his heart he could feel he was protecting her and was coming off a bit over dramatic to me.", "Also to add, Police can't do anything without a custody order in place, it's a civil matter", "I mean he can I didn\u2019t come up with the scheduling he chose it based on his job. To get her once a week.", "I agree with everything you said, but could you please explain what CYA means? I haven\u2019t seen that abbreviation on this sub before.", "Make sure that all interactions are over text or VM. CyA indeed", "Even with a custody agreement the police will rarely ever get involved because \"it's a civil matter\".\n\nSource: was kidnapped by biodad as a child and the police refused to do anything; resulted in my maternal grandfather tracking him down and helping my mom kidnap us back. Both sides called the police when we were taken and they refused to get involved (civil matter). Also happened when my sister's ex refused to let me pick my niece up for her even though I was cleared to in the custody agreement. She was on her way home and would've met me at her place by the time I drove my niece out but he was pissed off at my sister because he found out she was dating and threw his weight around. Police were called and told us \"civil matter\" / deal with it ourselves.", "Look for a ProBono lawyer who does family/custody/divorce work", "This. When I wrote my comment, they hadn't updated that there was no actual, legally-binding, custody agreement.", "Child support and custody are generally two different things. You need to get the custody agreement worked out.", "No. Support and custody are 2 different things. You need an attorney to file for a custody hearing.", "Without a formal agreement there is NOTHING the cops can do. With no court agreement in place, they'll just tell you that your rights do not trump his and vice versa. You need an agreement like yesterday. I will say, if you have written documentation of him threatening to keep her from you, can file and request an emergency hearing and get a temp order.", "Yes I just edited in my original post to make it less confusing about the custody part.", "Just wanted to chime in and say hand foot n mouth is super common with young kids. Obviously we\u2019d all prefer to avoid it, and clearly you tried to, but I hope you\u2019re not beating yourself up too much.", "Your worry is totally justified. He sounds very difficult to coparent with. I wouldn't just deny him access, but maybe try to ask a legal aid/women's shelter/or law school attorney if you can demand to supervise his visits? I know legal help can be hard to get, which sucks. \n\nTake multiple screenshots and send them to yourself in email. Heck, send them to a trusted relative/friend, too.\n\nI learned the hard way that even if you pay your provider to store your texts , if there's an issue downloading them the provider (it was Verizon in my case) will refuse to help. I lost texts I really needed for a court case and even though I'd been paying for the service Verizon just shrugged. \n\nI hope he's just venting and doesn't actually try anything, but how awful to threaten you with that.", "Toys  is one thing. What you need to worry about is appropriate sleeping accommodations, enough food, cleanliness(not talking \u201cppl live here\u201d conditions), water,  laundry up to date, visible dangers for toddler and children, etc \n\nGood luck and hopefully he comes to his senses and y\u2019all can have a shared custody agreement that benefits your daughter. I hate this back and forth fighting between parents that only make things bad for the children.", "Cool. Good luck with everything.", "Is it something you and him can squash? Or at least mitigate so this isnt happening again?\n\nYou know him much better than i do, so if anything im suggesting wont work or is plain wrong thats fine. Im just viewing this as a dad looking to protect his child. \n\nI have a previous coworker who just got arrested for violating a restraining order, im assuming from his gf, and hes a good dude who loves his kids above everything. Idk what happened but either they got in a shouting match or he came over drunk wanting to see her and the kids and wouldnt leave and she used the order to get cops there. I just dont like seeing good parents lose their kids over petty bullshit if its possible ya know?", "Cover Your Ass", "Cover Your Ass, it's not a sub-specific abbreviation.", "Yeah, I should have been more clear. The police are empowered to enforce a custody agreement, but there is the chance they will use the \"civil matter\" excuse to avoid involvement. It's not guaranteed one way or another, but that doesn't mean they aren't on your side. Further, by calling them out, you can get a record of the other parent breaking said agreement. Unfortunately, this is all made moot since there is no legally binding custody agreement yet.", "I thought they did both together when you go? Do they not ? And do I have to do that separately(the court scheduling)", "Okay good to know I\u2019ll do that then.", "Just a heads up OP usually the rash for HFM is the last thing to develop and the person has been contagious for days before the rash arrives. You likely had no idea when the exposure happened if it\u2019s a typical HFM case and that\u2019s why it\u2019s contagious (I\u2019m a school nurse). It\u2019s a really hard illness to prevent.", "Yeah, I\u2019m saying like In the means of that\u2019s the only things I\u2019d worry more about as the house is pretty clean otherwise . As far as sleeping iknow it sounds worse to be with a baby living with family vs having my own place . She has her own crib and dresser, pretty much everything a child would have if they had their own room and we have dividers to divide us from the rest of house . I make sure she\u2019s fed and well and take her to her child well exams and they say she\u2019s growing well. I\u2019m not too worried about him threatening cps but will definitely keep on top of things.", "He can hold a grudge I don\u2019t see him forgiving me over threatening that as he doesn\u2019t mess with the cops like that . I do feel that all in all he is a good dad to her. He can be a bit controlling though at times. I guess I\u2019ll take it as overprotective ness.", "Sorry if your coworker has a restraining order - which are notoriously hard to get even for DV victims - he is NOT a good parent or a good dude.

There are a lot of laws that can come into play.  Usually custody and child support are seperate, but sometimes a court will still reference parenting time.  \n\nIn some areas, if the parties weren't married, the mother has sole legal and physical custody.  However, then it's an issue of proving that and getting the police to enforce it.  \n\nMy point is, custody can be complicated.  And you need someone who is familiar with the laws were you live and your facts to properly advise you on the best way to move forward.", "You definitely should because without a legal agreement the police aren\u2019t going to be likely to help you. How often does he see her?", "If you have no money to hire a lawyer, contact your local legal aid agency. There are some very good attorneys that work with women at no or reduced cost. It's called pro bono representation.", "Indeed. Came over drunk to see his kids and wouldn't leave until the cops came = not a good parent or dude.", "I mean, sometimes those are kind of the same thing", "He only sees her once a week", "Spit take. Thanks for that.", "Keep a log of how often he has her and how long he does. If he is later than your agreed upon time make note of that.
