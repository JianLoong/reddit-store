I had ended up telling my ex this just to let him know and keep him in the loop.\n\n Now fast forward to this week it was his time to get her, he usually gets her once a week and I have her the remainder days due to him working a lot of hours. So he calls me being pissed that our child is getting sick pretty much blaming me making it seem like I didn\u2019t take the necessary precautions to keep her from getting sick. Even tho I made sure to not be around my brother and Clorox wipe down everything he might of touched and used alot of hand sanitizer on our hands. I told him that I was trying and he proceeded to say he doesn\u2019t want to put her back in this house to endanger her with this disease since my brother is here. I said if she is sick already then it wouldn\u2019t matter if she is here or there because she is already sick and that my brother is better now and back to school. We end up arguing and the fact that he works so much means he wouldn\u2019t have been able to take care of her there and he would\u2019ve ended up trying to pawn her off to someone else in his family. I left it at that as I had to work so I got back to him later on that night as it would\u2019ve been time for him to drop her off.\nI call him and say \u201cAre you going to bring her back at the time we agree on or should I just come and pick her up\u201d He ignores my question to then argue some more with me so I finally said okay I will just pick her up then to he replies with a \u201c bet I won\u2019t answer\u201d so I said okay so if you don\u2019t bring her back at said time I will call the police.\nNow he\u2019s mad at me, can\u2019t look at me the same says I\u2019m evil, etc and is now threatening full custody and that if he gets it I\u2019ll never hear from him again which means I\u2019d never hear from my child again.

You warned him that if he did such a thing, you would call the police. He's breaking the custody agreement, so the police will be on your side, and his doing that will likely prevent him from winning full custody of your child. In fact, at this point there's a good chance that a judge would award you scheduled visitation for your ex with your child. He'd no longer have the ability to threaten you with such nonsense. Just because he doesn't understand how she got sick and how it wasn't anything to do with your ability to properly care for your child, doesn't mean that a judge is going to agree with his faulty conclusion. And even if he was to get full custody, all you'd have to do is mention his threats and the court would make sure he understands that if he leaves with your child without permission, he would be brought up on charges of kidnapping. He can't legally keep you from seeing your child, full custody or not.", "NTA, it's not harsh to threaten to call the police when your ex isn't abiding by your custody agreement. If he won't bring your child back, getting the police involved is the right next step.", "Keep all this information and correspondence and then talk to your lawyer. I'd talk to the police as well just to make them aware of the situation and possibly preemptively contact cps and let them know what's going on in case he decides to try that route.\n\nNta, he failed the agreement and kids get sick. Neglect and endangering her would be refusing care or telling her to go around and lick people who are sick. Not \"hey just be aware this has occurred and she may have been exposed.\"", "He's violating the custody agreement.  The police enforce the custody agreement.  NTA.", "You are not wrong and NTA here. Plus your ex is violating whatever custody agreement that was made between you and possibly by the court judge. Now start lawyering up and let the lawyers deal with him on your behalf", "As a man who has had the cops called on something similar (much older child, and a different issue that she was actually refusing to acknowledge, with a teenager who was refusing to go back) I'm going to say NTA. Kids get sick.  You can't keep her in a bubble her whole life, he sounds like he has been waiting for an excuse here. Good luck, it is hard to navigate this, but it has an end, honest.", "NTA. He was threatening to keep your child from you (in violation of your prearranged custody agreement) b/c she got sick w/a common childhood illness while accusing you of being neglectful.", "Keep a record of all of his outbursts; try to stick to texts so you have it in writing. You have done nothing wrong and he is NOT acting in her best interests.", "NTA\n\nWrite down what he said about keeping your child from you. Date, time, everything. Try to get it word for word.\n\nKeep a record of when he breaks your custody agreement, when he threatens you with withholding your child or keeping you from her. Tell your lawyer (if you have one). What he\u2019s threatening is appalling.", "Info. Is your custody agreement through the court or an informal agreement?  If through the court, definitely call the police. If informal, the police can't  do anything.  Keep track of all the incidents and go to court to get a formal custody agreement.", "Do you have a notebook? You need to write all this stuff down. Every interaction with date and time. They'll very often be accepted as evidence in a family court case (I was a family law paralegal for a long time). Start creating your evidence now. Also, I can't think of any judge that would hand over custody of your child just because they got sick with foot and mouth nonetheless, which is incredibly contagious and can go around a classroom in a heartbeat. It's not a disease you get from lack of cleanliness, it's a viral infection and a pretty virulent one at that.\n\nAlso, if you have a designated time and place to pick up your child, you need to be there to pick up your child. Whether he is there with your child or not. Then you need to put it in your notebook that he was there or not. If he's not there, but he's always been there before. You should call him first. If he won't answer then you should call the police, because what he's done is kidnapping at that point. He's not authorized to have your child then, because you were supposed to make the hand off. I'd do it especially because he threatened you early with making that child disappear. I'd also make sure to mention that to the cops.", "NTA he was being an unreasonable jerk and using your daughter as a pawn to be mean and manipulative. Now he\u2019s upset because it didn\u2019t go how he wanted.  He needs to grow up.", "NMI. What\u2019s the schedule set forth by the court. If there isn\u2019t one. It isn\u2019t kidnapping he has the same rights to the child as you do.", "Seems as though you have an informal custody agreement, one not mandated by the court\u2026.if so then police involvement would be moot, as dad has the same access rights to the child as you too\u2026,suggest you and he, go to court and get an official custody and support issue, one that includes his concern for appropriate medical treatment and care\u2026.I\u2019m going with NAH and simply suggest both working towards a more effective co-parenting plan", "INFO: has he behaved like this before? Is there any pattern of him attempting to keep her outside of your agreement or is this a one-time occurrence?", "You ignored his calls at first, then he ignored your calls.  You're both being childish.", "Im gunna be different but i need some info:\n\n- is he at least cordial with you about the child?\n- is him having her a threat to her safety?\n- is he always like this or is he acting out because hes concerned?\n\nCuz whether the custody thing is official or not, if hes at least doing this for concern for his childs health you cant act like hes lost his mind. Id say talk to him if hes usually reasonable and agreeable. Tell him youre sorry you made the police threat but you felt backed into a corner, and that you arent trying to keep her from him but his work makes it hard. If youre comfortable with it, let him have her a few extra days so he has a little faith in you and this doesnt happen again. Next time someone is sick and you wanna protect her, see if he wants to take his time early. \n\nIf you cant work with him then no worries and stick to what you gotta do obviously, but there could be another approach to this too", "You two need couples counselling. It is possible to co-parent as separated parents without having a screaming match.\n\nESH In a situation like this ideally your ex would take your daughter as soon as everyone knows that there is a contagious disease in the house. If that\u2019s impossible, there would ideally be a discussion about whether daughter stays at home so as not to spread it to Dad if she is contagious or whether Dad takes daughter and keeps her once he realizes that she is sick.\n\nPassing your daughter around like a contagious football\u2026 is like 2000 - 2022 never happened.", "Of course Nta", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He's using it to manipulate you with fear so you will bend to his will. He has exactly zero chance of getting full custody. \n\n\nNot only is a retainer for a custody lawyer something like 5k just to get started, custody battles often cost tens of thousands and span for months or even years, and they almost never end in a spiteful parent being allowed to take away a child to punish the primary caregiver. He's delusional. The court will want to maintain the status quo and keep the child with the primary caregiver and with in the child's routine. Custody is based on best interests. Not what Dad wants to punish Mom for not letting him verbally abuse and control her. He could fight for 50/50 but he's never going to get full custody. Especially not over something normal like a kid getting sick from school or daycare. You'd have to be doing heroin, the child would have to be starving to death, CPS level abuse or neglect or danger, for him to have a shot at something like that.
