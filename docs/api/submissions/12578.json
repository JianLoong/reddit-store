You're being more than generous in the amount you offer, you have a right to invite HIS FAMILY to show up.  \n\n\nNTA", "NTA  I may be old fashioned, but I believe that the person paying for the party is the person hosting the party, even if the party is your child's wedding reception.  The bride and groom are the guests of honor but you are the host and having a small contingent of family that you are choosing to invite doesn't seem unreasonable to me.", "NTA, it\u2019s going to be a massive event and she won\u2019t be able to greet each and every party guest anyways, so what is an additional 8 more people going to hurt? Especially when being given 150K for a wedding. The entitlement is unreal.", "NTA.\n\nAshley is being TA though. I'm sure Ashley doesn't know EVERYONE coming (besides those 8 people) well. Just like on your side of the family, I'm sure there's family, young or old, that she doesn't truly know well and see all of the time. Or spouses of friends. I think that's insulting to your side of the family because just because she doesn't know them well means they aren't invited.\n\nI don't think you're asking for a lot. AT ALL. With that many people coming, it's not like it's going to be intimate and that she's going to be able to talk to everyone there.", "NTA, as someone who's smart enough to save up a 150k bank account, you should know that you're not being an asshole. You're clear in your communication, it's more than fair to have an extra seat for extra relatives. I would understand couples who are planning with a tight budget to exclude certain people, but they're literally having the wedding paid for. Ashley is being an asshole excluding your son's family for no apparent reason.", "NTA. 8 guests out of 400 are going to ruin HER day? I don't think that's a lot to ask in exchange for 150 THOUSAND dollars.", "NTA. It's eight people among three hundred. These stipulations are barely anything, especially since you're paying so much money. Her family is being weird or lacks context.", "Going to go with NTA here. It would have been different if it was a small wedding, then it would have been understandable to not have not-so-close relatives there but since they are inviting 300-400 guests, it is a big wedding. So I don't see why it should bother them this much to have 8 more people whom the groom knows.", "If you're inviting 300-400 people, I find it hard to believe you know every person \"that well\". I'd say NTA, since it's the groom's relatives and it's the bride doesn't want to invite them.", " Nta\n\nIt would be different if it was a small wedding or they didn\u2019t get along with the relatives. But a 300+ person wedding they won\u2019t even notice them. You are being really kind by paying for the wedding.", "Hmmm.. by the title I was leaning towards a you're TA judgment but after reading your stipulations I don't feel you're being unreasonable. NTA. The 8 you want to invite are actually family. These aren't just friends. It's crazy for the bride to think she has to be close to or have met every single one of the groom's family members just for them to get an invite to the wedding.", "The bride is the definition of entitled. To accept the gift of a 150k wedding but not allow you to invite 8 relatives (which would be in essence about 2% of the guest list)- that\u2019s ridiculous. Does she allow any \u201cplus-1\u2019s\u201d or is there an interview/approval process for that? NTA", "NTA, and do not pay for the wedding if they do not let you.", "NTA, does she really know the 300-400 other people that are going to be there? With so many people I'm sure she wouldn't even notice a handful of them", "NTA in this case.\n\nAshley has no actual objection (people she personally objects to based on history, etc.), she just \"doesn't know them well.\" She has time to get to know them. She also won't know every one of those hundreds of people \"well.\" You have a specific list, not eight invitations you get to give to anyone. They are Caleb's family.\n\nNormally, a gift (even of money) is a gift and strings are AH-ish, but this is a clear stipulation ahead of time, for funding a specific event.\n\nStay firm. If this is her hill to die on, leave it to her family to foot the bill for the wedding. If they do this, though, be gracious and enjoy the small wedding (if you get invited).", "While generally you\u2019d be TA for wanting to add to the guest list (I generally don\u2019t agree with that) I\u2019m leaning NTA. \n\nAs you appear to be paying for everything, and the brides family paying nothing, and as it\u2019s a big event (400?) and the 8 people were part of your sons growing up- 8 people/ family members is not unreasonable. With the size and money invested, it\u2019s absolutely not her day, it\u2019s a family event.  \n\nI also think the planner was a good idea with such s large amount of money invested.\n\n1) they\u2019re family members you\u2019ve mentioned have been involved and both bride and groom have met them. Assuming there hasn\u2019t been a falling out between the 8 and bride or groom - in a wedding of 300-400 guests , 8 additional family members are not an issue\n\n2) you\u2019re paying. Where I\u2019m from most the time the bride and groom pay themselves and if parents pay culturally isn\u2019t it supposed to be the brides family pays? But you\u2019re paying and her family according to you isn\u2019t paying anything. \n\nYou\u2019re also paying a very very generous amount to support all her large family to attend. She should be appreciative. 8 people in 3-400 people she won\u2019t even notice. She\u2019s being unreasonable. \n\n3) your son sucks a bit. It\u2019s not her day. It\u2019s not even their day. If it was their day only they could elope or pay for the whole thing themselves. But weddings and especially big weddings are family and small community events. 3-400 people is not them alone. It\u2019s about people in your life coming together to celebrate and witness the union. The 8 people are aunts and uncles. Your son needs to stand up a bit here. \n\n\nYou could retract some money and only pay for half the budget for Caleb\u2019s side, or retract all and say if it\u2019s her/their day they can pay for it. \n\nI personally don\u2019t get paying large amounts for one day event, or even big weddings lol, but if that\u2019s your thing she\u2019s looking a gift horse in mouth.", "NTA - tldr; bride is entitled \n \nHonestly your request is perfectly reasonable, and given no mention of past issues between the bride and the relatives, I don't see why she would be bothered by 8ish additional guests out of 400, especially if they are the groom's family. Is nobody bringing any plus-ones that haven't been personally vetted by the bride?  At the end of the day, you made the offer to them with very clear terms, whether or not they accept is up to them. It's your money and she's not entitled to it, especially not such an exorbitant amount of it.", "NTA. Unless of course Caleb has an issue with them coming and is using her as a buffer so he doesn\u2019t have to have that difficult conversation with you (you say they were involved in his life growing up but often there are issues kids have with older relatives that they don\u2019t share with their parents). Maybe talk to him about it to see if it\u2019s his or her issue.\n\nIf it really is her issue I\u2019d try and communicate that these relatives really would be upset and hurt if they didn\u2019t get to see Caleb get married. Try and get her to think about how her elderly relatives, that saw her grow up, would feel if they weren\u2019t able to share her wedding day. And maybe let her get to know the people you want to invite a bit better before the wedding. A dinner at your house with all involved could be enough to convince her. Just don\u2019t try and do it in a sneaky way, be honest and upfront.", "NTA.  For any large event like that, there will be two lists.  One is \"invited\".  Two is \"present\".  And if you bother to examine them closely, you will note that there is surprisingly little overlap between the two.  There will be lots of invited people who plan to be there who (for one reason or another) don't show at all.  Even if they previously were really excited about going.  There will also be a bunch of wedding crashers.  Most of them will be unannounced (PLUS ONES).  \n\nBottom line, a huge wedding like that will end up having a lot of guests.  But many of those guests will be (SURPRISE!!!).  And many of them will not be close (buddy buddy) with either bride or groom.\n\nIn context, if someone wants to finance the wedding and they want to include 8 people (just 8?) on the guest list....\n\nThat's not a big problem.  Same with the wedding planner thing.  Wedding planner?  No?  Who care's?  If OP is paying and wants a wedding planner...FINE.\n\nOP, your demands are easy to swallow.  NTA", "NTA.\nMy wedding was much, much smaller, and much, much, much cheaper, both sets of parents contributed, and so they got to invite a couple of people they wanted to (some family friends). It\u2019s really not unreasonable to ask that if you\u2019re going to pay. In my case, it was people on my side who i completely forgot about when writing up a guest list, so overall, it can be a better way of doing it.", "Based purely on the information in the post NTA. You've been upfront about your conditions from the outset which is fair. If you'd agreed to pay with no stipulations and then moved the goal posts, that would make you TA.\nI am however assuming this isn't the only option they have i.e. they could pay for it themselves and there would be no pressure to invite anyone they both don't want to. If that's not an option you probably need to decide what's more important to you - relationship with DIL or having your extended family there for their day.", "NTA.\n\n1. When someone pays for an entire wedding, it is perfectly justifiable to add reasonable stipulations.  Caleb and Ashley have the choice of rejecting your funding if they don't want to agree to those stipulations.\n2. Weddings should be relatively equitable in terms of guests.  If not outright equal numbers for both people getting married, then equal \"circles\" of guests (for example, second cousins or great aunts/uncles for both or for neither).  If one person has more family and the other has more friends, that's fine.  But it cannot be Ashley having all the guests she wants and you (or Caleb) not being able to have the same.  That is, unless Caleb agrees to it and decides not to accept you paying for the wedding.\n\nNot totally relevant to this, but Ashley also needs to understand that she has (or will be forming) a partnership with Caleb.  Maybe Ashley is uncomfortable having these guests and it's \"her day\".  It's also Caleb's day, and Caleb may want them in attendance.  Ashley has to be considerate of what Caleb wants as well.", "NTA. Your offer is very generous and they have control if they want to accept. You son might have to neogiate with his new wife but you do not it is your money.", "NTA. They can always have a smaller wedding and you don\u2019t pay for it. 8 people isn\u2019t a lot TBH. My parents paid for my wedding and my mom and dad had 300 people between them.", "How about you pay for my vow renewal and you can definitely invite the 8 people and I bet you would have a blast at my party. Just saying.", "NTA . And it's not HER day, it's THEIRS. They're getting married to eachother . \n\nShe's got control issues . This is a very weird hill for her to die on.", "NTA. You could be inviting Osama Bin Laden for all I care, if you\u2019re paying 150,000 dollars for the wedding, you can invite whomever you like. Woman sounds like a bridezilla. Weddings are for the family. It isn\u2019t her fifteenth birthday party. If some relatives she doesn\u2019t wanna come are gonna come, she can suck it up.", "with that much money i could pay off my credit card and put myself through college. so nta lol if i was being offered something like this for anything i'd grovel on my knees and do whatever was asked of me.", "Holy shit 150k! That's massive. My tiny wedding is only up to 35k atm haha\n\nAsking for 8 people isn't bad considering how many are going. They won't even be noticed. She clearly doesn't like your family is why she's doing this. Don't pay for they deserve it. We'll she doesn't", "First off, it's THEIR day, not HER day. Red flag right there.\n\nSecond of all, who the hell cares if she doesn't know someone from your side of the family? Your son certainly wouldn't know each and every guest from her side either. That is completely normal, it's not like you learn the other person's entire family tree before you get married.\n\nYour offer is completely fair and you've given them a great choice. Now, it is completely within their hands whether to accept or reject your financial support (and if they choose to reject it you need to accept their choices).\n\nNTA. And best of luck!", "NTA\n\nIt's a wedding of 300-400 people, you're paying $150k, so your ask of 8 people is reasonable. I suspect this is a power play move by Ashley.", "NTA- If having his family there makes her uncomfortable, Ashley and her family can pay for the wedding themselves. Then she can invite or not invite anyone she likes.", "NTA\n\nI do not think you are being unreasonable asking to invite 8 people to a 300+ people event costing you 150k", "NTA\n\nEight people out of 400 is a reasonable request, especially if you are the one paying for the entire affair. \n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to wrap my head around is the $150,000 price tag.

She can't possibly be close to 400 people, she can ignore 8 people who she isn't close with but are relatives of the groom.
