Caleb has been with his fiance Ashley 26f for 4 years and they recently got engaged. I have offered to pay for their wedding, with two stipulations \n1. They use a wedding planner- I feel this is essential due to the size of the event and the amount of money going into it.\n2. I have 8 people I'm inviting (older relatives that I'm close with)\nThey both agreed to a wedding planner and said they will look for one that they feel comfortable with. The issue is Ashley does not want me to be able to invite anyone. Caleb knows the relatives well but it's not super close with them and Ashley has only met them a few times.\nThe wedding is going to be a very large and grand affair she comes from a very large family and we have a very large family. We're expecting 300 to 400 guests and I've given them a budget of $150,000 USD. \nCaleb says he doesn't care but it makes Ashley uncomfortable since she doesn't know them that well and it's her day. Her family is saying that I am TA (even though they aren't willing to continue financially) \nI don't care about any of the other details of their wedding whatever they choose is fine as long as I get the two things that I want. \nSo Reddit am I TA?\n\nEdit: the 8 people are my aunt's and uncles, they helped me a lot with the kids. We don't come from money, I was in a severe car accident that left me paralyzed from the waist down. With the lawsuit money I made some investments that turned out to be very lucrative. Without their help between watching the kids and financially I would have been up shits creek without a paddle when my kids were younger.\n\nEdit 2: I see a lot of people saying that she's a gold digger but I do not agree with that. Her father is a very well respected and sought after criminal defense attorney in our area. Her mom runs an at home business. Ashley is currently a surgical intern whereas Caleb is an RN. Her parents paid for all of them to go to college which is why they're not willing to contribute financially towards a wedding.\nI just got done having lunch with Caleb to talk to him about the conundrum we're in. He said that he hasn't spoken to her about what they've done for us in the past. He did not realize that it would be such a big deal for them to come and figured because of their age they would not want to come. \nAshley knows the majority of the family really well because I host birthday parties for all three kids as well as a 4th of July barbecue every year. My aunts and uncles rarely attend the events that I throw because it's hard for them to get around. I'll update after Caleb gets back to me about their talk.", "created_utc": 1679124105, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11uhd8e/aita_for_telling_my_son_and_his_fiance_i_wont_pay/", "score": 5848, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The groom's opinion matters too. What does she expect, that only her family should get invited? You're being more than generous in the amount you offer, you have a right to invite HIS FAMILY to show up.  \n\n\nNTA", "NTA  I may be old fashioned, but I believe that the person paying for the party is the person hosting the party, even if the party is your child's wedding reception.  The bride and groom are the guests of honor but you are the host and having a small contingent of family that you are choosing to invite doesn't seem unreasonable to me.", "NTA, it\u2019s going to be a massive event and she won\u2019t be able to greet each and every party guest anyways, so what is an additional 8 more people going to hurt? Especially when being given 150K for a wedding. The entitlement is unreal.", "NTA.\n\nAshley is being TA though. I'm sure Ashley doesn't know EVERYONE coming (besides those 8 people) well. Just like on your side of the family, I'm sure there's family, young or old, that she doesn't truly know well and see all of the time. Or spouses of friends. I think that's insulting to your side of the family because just because she doesn't know them well means they aren't invited.\n\nI don't think you're asking for a lot. AT ALL. With that many people coming, it's not like it's going to be intimate and that she's going to be able to talk to everyone there.", "NTA, as someone who's smart enough to save up a 150k bank account, you should know that you're not being an asshole. You're clear in your communication, it's more than fair to have an extra seat for extra relatives. I would understand couples who are planning with a tight budget to exclude certain people, but they're literally having the wedding paid for. Ashley is being an asshole excluding your son's family for no apparent reason.", "NTA. 8 guests out of 400 are going to ruin HER day? I don't think that's a lot to ask in exchange for 150 THOUSAND dollars.", "NTA. It's eight people among three hundred. These stipulations are barely anything, especially since you're paying so much money. Her family is being weird or lacks context.", "Going to go with NTA here. It would have been different if it was a small wedding, then it would have been understandable to not have not-so-close relatives there but since they are inviting 300-400 guests, it is a big wedding. So I don't see why it should bother them this much to have 8 more people whom the groom knows.", "If you're inviting 300-400 people, I find it hard to believe you know every person \"that well\". I'd say NTA, since it's the groom's relatives and it's the bride doesn't want to invite them.", " Nta\n\nIt would be different if it was a small wedding or they didn\u2019t get along with the relatives. But a 300+ person wedding they won\u2019t even notice them. You are being really kind by paying for the wedding.", "Hmmm.. by the title I was leaning towards a you're TA judgment but after reading your stipulations I don't feel you're being unreasonable. NTA. The 8 you want to invite are actually family. These aren't just friends. It's crazy for the bride to think she has to be close to or have met every single one of the groom's family members just for them to get an invite to the wedding.", "The bride is the definition of entitled. To accept the gift of a 150k wedding but not allow you to invite 8 relatives (which would be in essence about 2% of the guest list)- that\u2019s ridiculous. Does she allow any \u201cplus-1\u2019s\u201d or is there an interview/approval process for that? NTA", "NTA, and do not pay for the wedding if they do not let you.", "NTA, does she really know the 300-400 other people that are going to be there? With so many people I'm sure she wouldn't even notice a handful of them", "NTA in this case.\n\nAshley has no actual objection (people she personally objects to based on history, etc.), she just \"doesn't know them well.\" She has time to get to know them. She also won't know every one of those hundreds of people \"well.\" You have a specific list, not eight invitations you get to give to anyone. They are Caleb's family.\n\nNormally, a gift (even of money) is a gift and strings are AH-ish, but this is a clear stipulation ahead of time, for funding a specific event.\n\nStay firm. If this is her hill to die on, leave it to her family to foot the bill for the wedding. If they do this, though, be gracious and enjoy the small wedding (if you get invited).", "While generally you\u2019d be TA for wanting to add to the guest list (I generally don\u2019t agree with that) I\u2019m leaning NTA. \n\nAs you appear to be paying for everything, and the brides family paying nothing, and as it\u2019s a big event (400?) and the 8 people were part of your sons growing up- 8 people/ family members is not unreasonable. With the size and money invested, it\u2019s absolutely not her day, it\u2019s a family event.  \n\nI also think the planner was a good idea with such s large amount of money invested.\n\n1) they\u2019re family members you\u2019ve mentioned have been involved and both bride and groom have met them. Assuming there hasn\u2019t been a falling out between the 8 and bride or groom - in a wedding of 300-400 guests , 8 additional family members are not an issue\n\n2) you\u2019re paying. Where I\u2019m from most the time the bride and groom pay themselves and if parents pay culturally isn\u2019t it supposed to be the brides family pays? But you\u2019re paying and her family according to you isn\u2019t paying anything. \n\nYou\u2019re also paying a very very generous amount to support all her large family to attend. She should be appreciative. 8 people in 3-400 people she won\u2019t even notice. She\u2019s being unreasonable. \n\n3) your son sucks a bit. It\u2019s not her day. It\u2019s not even their day. If it was their day only they could elope or pay for the whole thing themselves. But weddings and especially big weddings are family and small community events. 3-400 people is not them alone. It\u2019s about people in your life coming together to celebrate and witness the union. The 8 people are aunts and uncles. Your son needs to stand up a bit here. \n\n\nYou could retract some money and only pay for half the budget for Caleb\u2019s side, or retract all and say if it\u2019s her/their day they can pay for it. \n\nI personally don\u2019t get paying large amounts for one day event, or even big weddings lol, but if that\u2019s your thing she\u2019s looking a gift horse in mouth.", "NTA - tldr; bride is entitled \n \nHonestly your request is perfectly reasonable, and given no mention of past issues between the bride and the relatives, I don't see why she would be bothered by 8ish additional guests out of 400, especially if they are the groom's family. Is nobody bringing any plus-ones that haven't been personally vetted by the bride?  At the end of the day, you made the offer to them with very clear terms, whether or not they accept is up to them. It's your money and she's not entitled to it, especially not such an exorbitant amount of it.", "NTA. Unless of course Caleb has an issue with them coming and is using her as a buffer so he doesn\u2019t have to have that difficult conversation with you (you say they were involved in his life growing up but often there are issues kids have with older relatives that they don\u2019t share with their parents). Maybe talk to him about it to see if it\u2019s his or her issue.\n\nIf it really is her issue I\u2019d try and communicate that these relatives really would be upset and hurt if they didn\u2019t get to see Caleb get married. Try and get her to think about how her elderly relatives, that saw her grow up, would feel if they weren\u2019t able to share her wedding day. And maybe let her get to know the people you want to invite a bit better before the wedding. A dinner at your house with all involved could be enough to convince her. Just don\u2019t try and do it in a sneaky way, be honest and upfront.", "NTA.  For any large event like that, there will be two lists.  One is \"invited\".  Two is \"present\".  And if you bother to examine them closely, you will note that there is surprisingly little overlap between the two.  There will be lots of invited people who plan to be there who (for one reason or another) don't show at all.  Even if they previously were really excited about going.  There will also be a bunch of wedding crashers.  Most of them will be unannounced (PLUS ONES).  \n\nBottom line, a huge wedding like that will end up having a lot of guests.  But many of those guests will be (SURPRISE!!!).  And many of them will not be close (buddy buddy) with either bride or groom.\n\nIn context, if someone wants to finance the wedding and they want to include 8 people (just 8?) on the guest list....\n\nThat's not a big problem.  Same with the wedding planner thing.  Wedding planner?  No?  Who care's?  If OP is paying and wants a wedding planner...FINE.\n\nOP, your demands are easy to swallow.  NTA", "NTA.\nMy wedding was much, much smaller, and much, much, much cheaper, both sets of parents contributed, and so they got to invite a couple of people they wanted to (some family friends). It\u2019s really not unreasonable to ask that if you\u2019re going to pay. In my case, it was people on my side who i completely forgot about when writing up a guest list, so overall, it can be a better way of doing it.", "Based purely on the information in the post NTA. You've been upfront about your conditions from the outset which is fair. If you'd agreed to pay with no stipulations and then moved the goal posts, that would make you TA.\nI am however assuming this isn't the only option they have i.e. they could pay for it themselves and there would be no pressure to invite anyone they both don't want to. If that's not an option you probably need to decide what's more important to you - relationship with DIL or having your extended family there for their day.", "NTA.\n\n1. When someone pays for an entire wedding, it is perfectly justifiable to add reasonable stipulations.  Caleb and Ashley have the choice of rejecting your funding if they don't want to agree to those stipulations.\n2. Weddings should be relatively equitable in terms of guests.  If not outright equal numbers for both people getting married, then equal \"circles\" of guests (for example, second cousins or great aunts/uncles for both or for neither).  If one person has more family and the other has more friends, that's fine.  But it cannot be Ashley having all the guests she wants and you (or Caleb) not being able to have the same.  That is, unless Caleb agrees to it and decides not to accept you paying for the wedding.\n\nNot totally relevant to this, but Ashley also needs to understand that she has (or will be forming) a partnership with Caleb.  Maybe Ashley is uncomfortable having these guests and it's \"her day\".  It's also Caleb's day, and Caleb may want them in attendance.  Ashley has to be considerate of what Caleb wants as well.", "NTA. Your offer is very generous and they have control if they want to accept. You son might have to neogiate with his new wife but you do not it is your money.", "NTA. They can always have a smaller wedding and you don\u2019t pay for it. 8 people isn\u2019t a lot TBH. My parents paid for my wedding and my mom and dad had 300 people between them.", "How about you pay for my vow renewal and you can definitely invite the 8 people and I bet you would have a blast at my party. Just saying.", "NTA . And it's not HER day, it's THEIRS. They're getting married to eachother . \n\nShe's got control issues . This is a very weird hill for her to die on.", "NTA. You could be inviting Osama Bin Laden for all I care, if you\u2019re paying 150,000 dollars for the wedding, you can invite whomever you like. Woman sounds like a bridezilla. Weddings are for the family. It isn\u2019t her fifteenth birthday party. If some relatives she doesn\u2019t wanna come are gonna come, she can suck it up.", "with that much money i could pay off my credit card and put myself through college. so nta lol if i was being offered something like this for anything i'd grovel on my knees and do whatever was asked of me.", "Holy shit 150k! That's massive. My tiny wedding is only up to 35k atm haha\n\nAsking for 8 people isn't bad considering how many are going. They won't even be noticed. She clearly doesn't like your family is why she's doing this. Don't pay for they deserve it. We'll she doesn't", "First off, it's THEIR day, not HER day. Red flag right there.\n\nSecond of all, who the hell cares if she doesn't know someone from your side of the family? Your son certainly wouldn't know each and every guest from her side either. That is completely normal, it's not like you learn the other person's entire family tree before you get married.\n\nYour offer is completely fair and you've given them a great choice. Now, it is completely within their hands whether to accept or reject your financial support (and if they choose to reject it you need to accept their choices).\n\nNTA. And best of luck!", "NTA\n\nIt's a wedding of 300-400 people, you're paying $150k, so your ask of 8 people is reasonable. I suspect this is a power play move by Ashley.", "NTA- If having his family there makes her uncomfortable, Ashley and her family can pay for the wedding themselves. Then she can invite or not invite anyone she likes.", "NTA\n\nI do not think you are being unreasonable asking to invite 8 people to a 300+ people event costing you 150k", "NTA\n\nEight people out of 400 is a reasonable request, especially if you are the one paying for the entire affair. \n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to wrap my head around is the $150,000 price tag.

My husband had no problem with it I did. Similar to your son he knew them and had a decent relationship with them, I didn\u2019t know who they were at all, never met them, seen them or heard about them. So I told his mother no. And she threw a hissy fit, threatening to disown him kick him out of the will, ect ect. He begged me to let it go but I refused. You see his mother is overly attached and likes to be in control of his life. And she\u2019s just not a nice lady when it comes to me behind closed doors it\u2019s a well known fact.

Does he usually have boundaries with you? Share his feelings and/or opinions if they differ from yours? There\u2019s more to the story here\n\n\nETA: your comments in your ETA2 really solidify for me that your son is more involved in your 8 guests being unwelcome than previously stated. I\u2019m not sure if you yourself notice his responsibility in this situation as you seem to only be blaming the fianc\u00e9 who clearly has only been given the chance to see this people as \u201cdistant relatives who never go to birthday or holiday parties MIL throws, but now are expected at the wedding\u201d", "Personally, I would say ESH.\n\nUltimately you are offering a generously large quantity of money, and so 8 people out of 300-400 in the scheme of things, shouldn't be that big a deal.\n\nBut this ask is for you, because these people matter to you, helped you a lot, were there for you. Not the bride and groom. It makes sense for them to be at a wedding for YOU, but not a whole lot of sense to me why you feel the need to bring them to Caleb and Ashley's, who aren't nearly as close to them. Though my guess would be you want them to see your son get married due to helping you get him to this point.\n\nI feel like Ashley and Caleb therefore should reject the money if unwilling to accept your terms, and I can see why Ashley may be uncomfortable with accepting your terms because some parents do demand to get to invite who they want, then 4 turns to 12, 12 turns to 30, 30 turns to 100.\n\nThis isn't an unreasonable fear when you know certain types of people.\n\nWhat might resolve this so everyone is happy though is talking with Ashley and honestly saying you want them there to see your son get married and you know this ask is more for you than for them and asking if she is really bothered about the 8 people, or if she is really afraid that if she gives you this inch, you'll take a mile, start micromanaging, demand 800 guests and go MILzilla over the whole wedding?\n\nBecause that seems to me what her real fear likely is - that you're asking something not too unreasonable now, but will slide into being unhinged later, and some reassurance that you don't want to do that could go a long way here and make her feel most comfortable that when you say 8, you mean 8, Maximum. Not 8, Pending.", "Caleb sounds like a typical  shoulder shrugger. He thinks has no responsibility in explaining to his fianc\u00e9 that these people literally saved your ass with help. He\u2019s a bit of a clueless asshole to not know these people or what they did for him and your whole family. I know my mom\u2019s sister and BIL helped her when she was pregnant and unwed. So my they mean a great deal to me. How is it possible that he lived in mom\u2019s house and never noticed these people helping?", "150k? Hell no. That is way too much for a wedding", "My first thought was OP to be a member of a cult or mafia, or that something dreadful happened between bride and those relatives. If none of this is the case I honestly do not understand daughters reasons. Are those relatives so old and fragile she suspects them of disturbing the perfect picture of the event???", "Exactly, this is an easy NTA. I understand it is her day, but her future MIL is paying for 150k to this wedding.. that\u2019s an INSANE amount. With that much, she deserves to have 8 guests picked out. Especially when she stated that these 8 people are family AND they helped assist with raising her fianc\u00e9 as a child\u2026. To refuse this is absurd. \n\nMy sister is getting married in the summer and my parents can only contribute 10k, yet she\u2019s still invited all whom our mother requested be invited as a thanks for her financial help.", "For our wedding, we only invited 150. Even then, I didn't know everyone on my husband's side very well. That's normal. It's totally bizarre to me that with such a massive guest list she thinks she has to be besties with every single one of them. It makes zero sense. \n\nNTA", "If you were to be my MIL, I\u2019d be so beyond grateful. I would let you invite however many people you want but ask if we can keep the wedding around 10k and use the rest for a down payment on a home. Like dang!", "If she wants NO input from you- then give her NO input. Including the input of $150k for a freaking wedding! She want something that big and fancy, she can pay for it herself if you can't even invite 8 pp. Good grief. NTA", "NTA Seems fair to me.   \n\n\nMy parents paid for the bulk of my wedding. (We paid for some, unbeknownst to them - it was back in the '90s and the whole thing came to around \u00a34k.) We had 80 people at the meal (the maximum allowed by the hotel) and another 20 for the evening celebration.  \n\n\nThere was one couple there that I didn't even know, to keep my dad happy.", "My mother wanted more than 60, we settled at 30.  8 would have been a dream.", "Yta for spending 150k on a party.", "I know it\u2019s flippant but I will let you create the guest list for a 150k wedding.", "Let them choose - $150k, wedding planner, and 8 guests of your choice, or they can pay for their own wedding if they don\u2019t want to agree to those three restrictions.", "My bad \ud83e\udd72", "How come it\u2019s her day, and not a shared day with the groom? Isn\u2019t he half the marriage? Wow, if it\u2019s this bad before the wedding how do you think it will be in a few years?\nOP NTA", "The couple won't even have time to greet these 8 people unless the wedding is a 3 day affair. NTA", "Agree 100%: NTA, and rescind the offer.\n\nIf you\u2019re not comfortable retracting the offer entirely, then pull a Darth Vader and alter the deal: \u201cOK, my stipulations remain, but now I\u2019m only (LOL) offering $50k. Take it or leave it.\u201d\n\nSeriously, my wife threw an amazing wedding at a gorgeous venue for a mere fraction of what you\u2019re offering.", "Maybe it\u2019s cause I didn\u2019t grow up with money but the thought of someone spending $150,000 on something for me gives me so much anxiety. I would be completely overwhelmed and so worried about how I was using my future mother in laws money. How is Ashley so entitled that she\u2019s not at all concerned with that!?", "Not a mini Ah, a major, greedy, entitled AH. Her family or the couple should be paying. The groom\u2019s mom is being extraordinarily generous and put 2 reasonable, unobtrusive stipulations to invite FAMILY. The bride is behaving atrociously.", "I agree about the money, but I think being upfront about it always changes the dynamic. They can opt in or out. It\u2019s only problematic when there are invisible strings attached.", "> How do they even want to invite 300-400 people...\n\nBelieve it or not... that is actually normal in some  cultures. I'm Macedonian and 300 would be on the low end for our weddings.", "Ashely is obviously extremely selfish and just don't care about OP's feelings or money at all based off her behavior. She's completely  undeserving of any, let alone such an enormous, gift.", "I don't care if I had Bill Gates' money, there's no way I'd pay $150K for *anybody's* wedding, including my own. That's ridiculous. Bridezilla thinks that's a reasonable amount of money, but she's going to draw the line at OP inviting 8 family members. \n\nThe initial offer should be entirely withdrawn already. OP had two conditions, bride did not agree to them. That should be the end of it.", "Take back your offer to pay. Ashley gets her entire extended family but your son doesn't get the relatives who helped you raise him? Nta", "I have to ask. Why is this girl so okay with 300-400 people but but not your 8? She can't possibly know all 3-400 people but she's okay with them attending her wedding. Why is she being so stubborn about the 8 you want to invite? Also, why such a lavish wedding when they're not paying for it, and her family isn't contributing? Did they just decide to get married and say \"op will pay\"? Would they be able to afford this large event without your contribution?", "If your aunts and uncles helped when your son was little, doesn\u2019t he know them well?  You should just insist on inviting them, no threats, just insist.  Something like kids, I insist that they are invited.  I\u2019m paying for 400 people, I\u2019ll pay for 408\u2026NTA.", "So does your son intimately know all these siblings/SOs, children, Aunts/Uncles of the bride?  Because if that's the standard, why should this excess be at the wedding but not your 8? who are also relatives?\n\nThere does not seem a balance here.  I'm getting a sense that this wedding is \"all about the bride\" and her vision.", "Die on this hill. You are giving them 150k seems like Ashley could agree to 8 people. You deserve to have your family there too", "Wait so it's OK for Ashley to invite extended family(her parents many many siblings), but it's not ok for you to invite your siblings when THE GROOM is happy for them to be there! Definitely NTA!", "I'd rather have 150k and buy my own gifts (or a house.)", "Do the people intend to poop like ducks?", "My ex had the same opinion of our wedding.  I was basically there as an accessory to her.", "South Africa is one of the most unequal countries on the continent what are you talking about", "I honestly didn't expect my husband to care much about the wedding planning...mostly because I didn't care much. I just wanted to get married. I was all about Vegas and Elvis. But when we got into actually planning something, he was really involved. Honestly, I loved it, and it made me love him more because he was so invested in the little details that made our day special. We had a lot of fun shopping for wedding outfits together, figuring out the food, etc. We had a small and very intimate garden ceremony and then a backyard party filled with lights and food and booze, and it was a blast. If wedding planning doesn't bring you closer, I think you're doing it wrong tbh.", "He could simply be spineless LOL", "Exactly what I was thinking- with this many people invited, there will be dozens of people there (because it\u2019s safe to say that with this scale of a wedding invites aren\u2019t going to be sent out as \u201cyou only\u201d) that neither the bride nor the groom know directly. So what\u2019s the problem with these eight additional people being invited, especially when there\u2019s 300-400 guests expected. If 400 invites are sent out then this just represents 2% of them; what exactly is the problem? If there were a potential issue with these particular 8 relatives being disruptive in their behavior, having bigoted viewpoints, etc then it\u2019s a different matter, but nothing here indicates that; with a really small wedding it\u2019s a decision of who to include, but at this scale it\u2019s instead a direct and purposeful exclusion as the number of relatives involved is much smaller than even the number of uncertain attendees based on who is invited and does vs. doesn\u2019t bring a guest, those who can\u2019t attend at all, and so on. \n\nI\u2019m not going to go nuclear and say \u201cCancel the wedding!!!\u201d but it does sound like some major discussions should be had to clarify who\u2019s going to be considered part of their \u2018family\u2019 going forward. If these 8 great-aunts/uncles are excluded now, who else from the OP\u2019s side of the family gets excluded in the future?", "Cut it way lower than that.  Just stop paying for anything.  It's HER wedding now.", "If I was related to them or joining the family I would love to be able to pick their brains!", "I don't know 50 people well enough to spend a day in a theme park with them, let alone inviting them to a wedding", "I'm an american and honestly I don't know anyone whose parents actually paid for their weddings. It's more of an \"upper middle class or higher\" thing than an american thing.\n\nAlso $150k is a house, I can't imagine spending that on a wedding.", "I think it's a tradition in name only for the most part. At this stage in my life the overwhelming majority of my friends (as well as myself) are all married. I have one friend whose parents paid for his wedding and they lead a cult... I mean church, and the wedding was a borderline church event. Aside from that, I haven't seen parents pay for weddings.", "It's only an American tradition for wealthy families. Everyone I know paid for their own weddings and their parents gifted them some money to assist but didn't pay for everything.", "Most of human society runs on complex unwritten rules.", "Invite them all over at Christmas. Give Ashley some cookies.  Give each of them a car with a huge bow on it.", "That explains my social problems."]}
