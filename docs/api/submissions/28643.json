How would OP's parents have balanced my 17 cousins against her 2?", "All of this!  It\u2019s just the beginning of a long campaign of manipulation and drama.  Nip it in the bud now.  OP is NTA.", "I respectfully disagree. If the parents choose not to attend over something so insignificant, she should not go out of her way to accommodate them later. That's rewarding bad behavior.", "I literally can't imagine threatening to miss your child's wedding over something so petty.\n\nWho keeps track of which side has more guests? It's not even like they had to cut people they wanted to invite. OP offered and their issue was they didn't like that their future DIL had more family wanting to attend.\n\nOP should absolutely call their bluff. Whether they attend or not, I think it will be a win-win for him.\n\nSome people were never meant to be parents.", "I suspect you meant to put NTA reading your comments.", "I can't even imagine what dealing with holidays with this family will be like. Or when kids enter the picture. Ugh\n\nAbsolutely stand up to them now OP", "I think he worded it weird but he's refusing to uninvite them.", "I think its worded poorly but he's not uninviting them. That's the conflict. With his parents not his fiance.", "Try 30 vs 2.", ">Now my parents are saying that my partner is selfish and manipulative\n\nYes, who's being selfish and manipulative?", "OP is the asshole for not inviting her partners aunts because her parents threw a tantrum", "I have some strange relatives, but these people are something else - entitled."]}
