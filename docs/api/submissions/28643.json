Obviously my parents are being unreasonable here and it's time I make my boundaries clear with them. I feel strongly in the principle that the aunties should attend if they're able to. This situation has been stressful for us so putting up a post like this helps reassure me that I'm not in the wrong here.\n* Apologies for the title, I did rush writing this up and could have made it clearer. Fortunately most of you in the comments have been able to get a sense of the situation pretty well regardless!\n* I have been reassured by the volume of people, especially in private messages, that have experienced similar things with their own parents. The power of Reddit makes you realise there are many people with shared experiences out there!

I think your parents are unbalanced all by themselves. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with this.", "NTA.\n\nThis isn't about fairness. This is a power play. It's an act of aggression to try and exert control over you as you move into the next phase of your life.\n\nI wonder if there have been similar incidents of controlling behavior in the past that you may have excused or overlooked.", "NTA\n\nPull your uno reverse card and say that if they choose to not come, they should stay away forever. You expect them there and you also expect them to act like true adults around your finac\u00e9 who does not deserve to be treated like this. \n\nThis is so ridiculous. How does this make sense?", "YTA. You're as foolish as your parents. If you can't stand up for your fiancee now, don't bother getting married. The relationship is doomed. You're not getting married to your parents.", "There is a general rule in play here. \"You can decide or not decide to come. That's up to you.\" That's all you have to say. You can add comments like, \"You don't get to manipulate me\" if you want a confrontation but honestly something very straight forward like, \"That's the offer, it's up to you\" is about all you need to engage with when people are attempting to pressure you into doing something by some variation of \"if you don't do this then I will (or won't) do such and such.  It's a variation of \"I'll give you this but on these conditions\"....to which I reply, \"I don't give or take gifts that are conditional as they really are just bribes, not gifts\".", "NTA, your parents are unreasonable. If they are freaking out over two aunts attending, I can't imagine what they will be like when/if you have children. How they'll demand balance", "NTA and I am sorry you are going through this. Your parents are acting like children. I know for a fact my husband had more people at our wedding than I did. It was his first marriage and my second so some of my family didn't come. I also had an Aunt tell me that I shouldn't marry my DH even though she never met him and talked badly about him. I told her that if she felt that strongly she didn't have to come and she didn't and neither did any of her adult children. The wedding was happier without their drama. Invite who you want. Your parents will either come around or they will lose out. Enjoy your day.", "Nta your parents hate you who tf does that to their child ? don\u2019t invite them and cut contact", "YTA you need to learn to say no to your asshole parents. They are in the wrong. Your marriage will fail because you have no spine when it comes to your parents. Set and enforce hard boundaries with them.", "NTA.  Fair does not equal same. This is supposed to be a pleasant and happy time, not a time of counting seats or pretend/perceived slights. In the grand scheme of things, it does not matter that one family might be larger than another.", "Your parents are making the most absolutely absurd and insane argument in the history of weddings. Are they usually this.... I think the medical term is.... \"batshit nuts\"?", "How is he not an AH when he sided with his parents? The last sentence is riddled with typos, but the title makes it clear. He gave into their demands.", "He did give in. He disinvited the aunties.", "AGREE!\n\nI'm also wondering if OP has been manipulated his whole life and didn't realize it. If he looks back with new eyes, he may see things about the relationship between him and his parents that explain this rotten manipulative behavior.  \n\nOP NTA!", "D) All of the above", "He did give in. He chose his parents over the aunties and his fiancee. There's typos in the last paragraph but there's the \"but\" that makes it clear he disregarded his fiancee's recommendation not to give in. The title also makes it clear that he disinvited the aunts.", "If parents are disrespectful to fiance, they deserve nothing good. I would uninvite them to the wedding (with a possible reinstatement if they adequately apologize and behave) and embrace my new family.\n\nMy brother's wedding was very uneven. The bride's family numbered more than twice my brother's. You know what my little family did? We celebrated their marriage and mingled at the wedding. We were actually happy for the couple. We were happy to be there and to meet the bride's family. Then again, we actually welcomed the bride into our family, which is something OP's parents do not seem to be doing.", "I think there are typos in his last question. It sounds like he agreed to do as his parents wished and uninvited the aunties instead of standing up to them. Which makes him a huge AH.", "He did not side with his parents, there\u2019s an update explaining the title is misleading", "Good catch!  Thanks for clearing that up for me!  Then I change my vote  to YTA!", "Seriously, who would want to spend more time with the sort of people who count wedding guests, and throw shitfits over a trivial percieved imbalance?", "You are absolutely right. Over on the JustNoMIL sub you can read a million stories of entitled in-laws making the married couples\u2019 lives miserable by doing a precise accounting of the minutes the couple and their kids spend with the other grandparents. Letting your parents rule your life and dictate how and when you are allowed to spend time with other people is just a nightmare. \n\nThe truth is that the time you spend with your respective families isn\u2019t always going to be mathematically the same, for lots of different and varied reasons. And that should be okay. Your parents are making unreasonable and entitled demands on you OP.  If you don\u2019t start setting boundaries with them now, this can have a terrible impact on your relationship with your partner. Marriages fail because of in-laws like your parents.", "This post can't be real.  No way adults are upset because their child is getting married and they are upset that the other side had more siblings than they did.\n\nMy wedding, wife's immediate side had 11 people.  Mine had ... 1.", "the parents are behaving very badly.  Time for an information diet.  Step back, stop sharing planning information with them, its not their wedding.   Stand up for your partner.  If you cave now, you will let them bulldoze you constantly", "OP needs to block them, do not entertain their nonsense. They want OP to pass some sort of test. If they cave on the aunties, then it will be 'OP should make a gesture and invite more of their family'.  It won't end. Block them. They have months to come to their senses, the rest of the family will also have opinions about them choosing a ridiculous demand over their child. Let them take the heat for their absurdity. Don't make your future wife go through this nonsense when planning your wedding should be a happy time.", "Op is male", "Heck my SO is an only child and I have 5 siblings, 3 with spouses, and 6 niblings.", "[removed]", "you would be surprised i know a couple that had a similar situation and the parents stood their ground and never showed up to the wedding in fact now nobody on either side speaks to each other and its been 20 years so far and counting.", "It's written in such a stilted manner as well. I say fake.", "But op wants to invite the aunts.  Did you read the entire thing??", "Oh well then. Obviously none of your siblings can come. /S", "This is the correct response.", "And it sounds like the silence would be glorious!", "If it isn't, the invite would go to the aunts, and parents wouldn't get one. End of that relationship.  I wouldn't deal with that kind of shit in my life at all.", "I think the title of the post is throwing people off.

NTA.", "NTA - I'm sorry but your parents sound heartless and  . . well, mean. Is this how they raised you . . .  to be so unkind? To refuse to attend their own son's wedding because their noses are out of joint from such a minor . . . unbelievably minor issue? You seem so nice and trying to be thoughtful . . .  They are totally unreasonable and must not be accomodated for that reason.", "NTA - Continue with your plans and let your parents do what they think is appropriate. Then afterwards, spend holidays with the family who came to your wedding.", "NTA. It is your wedding, you can invite whoever you want.", "Are your parents adults?  This is so childish!  NTA", "NTA but\u2026I can see how they could be upset that you are not inviting close family if I understand correctly (parents, siblings and one other family member each), but then your fianc\u00e9 is inviting two more family members. I understand everyone has to draw the line with wedding guests somewhere, but just saying for an alternative perspective it does seem unusual to not invite aunts/uncles/cousins/grandparents (assuming you have relationships with them). I\u2019m sure that makes them feel it\u2019s unfair that the other side can have a couple extra. Not saying their behaviour is warranted (it is not). Just thinking where they might be coming from. \nI hope you are able sort it out with them as I\u2019m sure you and your parents both want them to be there on your special day", "Glad to see that you realize how ridiculous your parents are being and that you need to establish & enforce boundaries! Without consequences, boundaries are meaningless!!

Are your parents always this peculiar?\n\nAlso, it\u02bbs pretty normal to be closer to one side of a family than the other. Based on this demonstration, I\u02bbm guessing it\u02bbs going to be your wife\u02bbs side. Your parents don\u02bbt sound like pleasant people to be around.", "So their wedding didn't involve family due to drama, so they're starting their own drama for your wedding? Got it. Or maybe they're so unreasonable because they want to continue the \"tradition.\"\n\nNTA. Stand your ground. This is your wedding. You and your fiancee get to decide who gets an invite. There is no rule that says the attendees from the groom's side and the bride's side have to be in equal numbers, and you even gave options to reach a compromise. But no, for them, it's their way or the highway. Your wedding day is about you and your fiancee, and they're making it about themselves. If you give in, next thing you know, you'll have fights about children names, parenting, how your wife is not a good mother, the grandkids don't spend enough time with them (if you want kids anyway), and the list could go on.", "NTA.", "The aunties are from another part of the planet?\n\nSounds to me like your parents are racist and want their culture to win but know being called racist is bad so came up with another excuse.\n\nNTA, keep the aunties, tell your parents you will be disappointed if they don\u2019t attend.", "NTA. I loved your updates! If your parents won\u2019t go because of this nonsense that says a lot about them, not you. You\u2019re doing great!", "NTA.
