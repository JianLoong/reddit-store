He\u2019s a high functioning alcoholic and was verbally and emotionally abusive my entire childhood and was unable to be there for me in any meaningful way. We aren\u2019t close and I don\u2019t talk to him much. But he still expects me to listen and obey everything he says. I\u2019d go Nc if it weren\u2019t for my mom. \n\nHowever, they generously offered to pay for the majority of the wedding on their own volition. We did not ask or expect money from them. Despite my complicated relationship with them, weddings are expensive and I appreciate the help. I have a decent paying job and while my fianc\u00e9 makes significantly less, he gives me extra money he has every month for wedding expenses. So far I have been able to afford my photographer, officiant, DJ, stationary, and decorations. I was nervous my dad (also my mom but less so) would be a pain about decisions. \n\nThe venue my fianc\u00e9 and I chose is very budget friendly and includes the most a venue can offer. We agreed to do the ceremony there as well and paid slightly more for it. After we signed the contract, my dad complained about us not getting married in a church. We aren\u2019t religious in any way. I would never ask him to convert to Catholicism and I don\u2019t want to be married in a church. He said he\u2019s paying, and I said we already signed the contract so he dropped it.\n\nNow he has an issue with the guest list. Our venue capacity is 140, but we decided to just invite 120 for a few reasons. My grandparents invited a bunch of their friends to my parents wedding, resulting in a 350 person wedding and my parents knew hardly anyone. They hated it. \n\nI invited 60 people and my fianc\u00e9 also had 60 slots, but his family isn\u2019t very large so he had extra seats and gave them back to me, as my side is bigger. \n\nMy dad texted me last night to say he counted 117 people on our invite list. I said that didn\u2019t seem right because my list was at 120 even when I sent it to them. I had to send it because I travel for work and so they offered to address envelopes for me. He admitted he cut some people to add his friends. \n\nHis friends are mean old alcoholics who hit on my 20 year old sister and make her uncomfortable, among other things. I don\u2019t like them don\u2019t want them there. He\u2019s claiming I\u2019m being a brat about this and I can\u2019t invite the people I had because others will get offended that they weren\u2019t invited. He\u2019s also taking control of the seating chart because he says I won\u2019t do it correctly and his family has to be in certain places. \n\nI don\u2019t think I am being unreasonable, and there\u2019s plenty of other things he\u2019s made problems of that have lead to this.\n\nAITA here?", "created_utc": 1679668713, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/120maw8/aita_for_being_upset_with_my_parents_for_changing/", "score": 442, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's hard to hold your ground when you're taking so much money from someone you knew was such a problem. A small wedding that you paid for yourself would leave you just as married and not beholden to someone you don't like.", "NTA stop giving him access hire a bouncer and turn away anyone who isn't on your list", "NTA but I would seriously consider cancelling the venue and just eloping. I know you want a real wedding- I get that- but do you really want him to hold this over you forever? He\u2019s already showing he doesn\u2019t value your opinion. I personally wouldn\u2019t accept anymore $ from him and just plan a nice vacation for you and your fianc\u00e9 to go get married. Real weddings are great but the important thing is WHO you are marrying- not where it happens! You could even do like a cruise wedding or destination wedding and still invite close friends.", "Nta, you are not obligated to accept the strings they attached after giving you a gift. Figure out what your boundaries are and set them firm.", "If someone other than her parents is TA it\u2019s you", "Paying for part of a wedding doesn\u2019t entitle him to remove anybody from the guest list.

I think I know the answer, but is it too late to just pay for the whole thing yourselves? I have a toxic father, and that's what we did. Paid for it ourselves. One of the best decisions ever. Also didn't ask him to walk me down the aisle. My husband did that. Still no regrets 19 years later.", "Any way your parents would be willing to call around and say that these guests are on your \"b-list\" and that they weren't supposed to be sent unless a certain number of regrets came in, but unfortunately all of your family and friends are able to attend so the venue doesn't have the space?\n\nOr is your dad that much of an AH.", "The enabler is also an asshole for letting this go on all these years and not protecting the kids.", "The wedding is in September, so I\u2019d have to get enough money to pay for the venue, which is all they\u2019ve paid for. It\u2019s too much for me to save up and also pay for the rest of the stuff we will need. I really don\u2019t care for him to walk me down the aisle or have a dance with him, but when I talked to my therapist she asked if I could tell him that. No, I can\u2019t really, not if they\u2019re paying and not if I want to keep myself sane. I\u2019d get bombarded by the rest of my family, which has happened every time I\u2019ve tried to cut him off. My therapist suggested I try and see it in a way where it isn\u2019t going to mean to me what it means to him. And if I feel like I have to do those things, I don\u2019t have to place importance in it. If that makes sense? Idk the longer I\u2019m in therapy the more I realize how messed up I am from the way I was raised and how I would rather let everyone else have their way so I don\u2019t have to face the backlash and that\u2019s a hard thing to come out of.", "So they weren\u2019t actually sent. I work out of state as a contract worker right now so my mom offered to address save the dates for me and I had sent them the address list which was clearly a mistake", "Oh, I do get the sentiment. I\u2019m just saying the mother herself isn\u2019t an asshole; her inaction just exemplifies the real assholiness twofold.", "I see. I hope it gets easier after September and that the wedding can be something of a \"reset\" for you and you can gain autonomy from him and feel you don't have to be beholden to him. It's the worst. I get it. <hug>", "That's good!  (at least)\n\nI was wondering - is it 117 + you and your husband-to-be annnnnd... (someone's child?)? \n\nAnyhoo, at least you have some time to switch things back.  And it's good they are save the dates, b/c you can probably just buy some new envelopes.  No one should be at your wedding who makes you uncomfortable.  While I do think (since there is the space), it is \"typical\" for the parents to invite some people, this is not in place of your guests and this is not anyone who will make anyone else feel unsafe.", "Thank you", "It is 117 total, I had some people that were like a b list, less close friends and such, but if we went off my list there were no openings for extra people unless some declined", "Uninvite your parents, send out new invitations, and send disinvitations to the nongratis.", "ESH.  \n\n\nHe's paying for your wedding so naturally he wants to invite his friends. His friends are people you don't want anywhere near you.  \n\n\nI'm afraid the solution is obvious; give him back the money and re-plan the wedding as something you and your fiance can afford together.  Feel free to invite your mother, by herself, and make clear to venue security that your dad isn't allowed in.", "NTA - tell your father he\u2019s not invited to the wedding", "YTA for not taking the responsibility of the guest list & your own invitations. Handing these off to you family has created quite a mess that you need to fix.", "NTA Honey you really need to cut him out of your life or you will be forever dominated and controlled as an adult by your father. You will always be his possession. Your mother enables him and does nothing to protect you. She chose him. Now is the time to choose you.", "Give him back the money and uninvite him and all his terrible friends or relatives. Otherwise he's bought control over you for a fair price of a medium sized wedding.", "NTA, but not very smart.  \nAlcoholic father + abusive + he's paying for the wedding = major trouble. I hope you can stand firm and exclude his drinking buddies.", "NTA but you know how your parents are and yet you took their money. And you don't want to stand your ground because you want your dream wedding. \n\nYou have a couple of options. Call all your vendors and put a password and say no changes allowed by the parents. If they threaten to pull your funding them that's the end of your relationship with them and it sounds like you'll be better off\n\nOr let your dad have the wedding he wants. \n\nBut do you think you'll enjoy your wedding? Is it fair to the groom and his family? And will you even keep a good relationship with your parents after?\n\nI say reclaim your wedding and cut your losses now", "He's 100% the Asshole\n NTA", "Do yourself a favour.

If you can\u2019t afford to get married off your own dime then don\u2019t. \nNTA but you need to look at why you are continuing to do this.", "NTA, but free money is rarely cheap.  Take it back over, without his expensive financial help.", "NTA. I would call the venue owner (or whoever is in charge) to tell them that all wedding details and changes are to be done through you and your fianc\u00e9, no one else. Get the original guest list and seating arrangement changed back and make sure you also have an usher to turn away people that aren't on the list.", "NTA but you\u2019re also wasting your money on therapy if you\u2019re going to do the complete opposite of what it\u2019s supposed to be helping you with. Unfortunately you\u2019re an adult and it\u2019s time to face hard decisions and make them as well. Your father has hurt you and both you and your mother enable him. She enables him by saying she can\u2019t make everyone happy and you enable him by not standing up for yourself. You owe yourself that at least. \n\nStop letting your parents steamroll and have involvement in your wedding. Get your guest lists and wedding invitations from your mother and enlist your fianc\u00e9 and friends to help you send them out. If you don\u2019t do something now, you\u2019re going to regret it in the long run and what\u2019s supposed to be a sentimental day with meaning (your grandparents, aunt and uncle, and etc.) will forever be tarnished.", "Oooooooooh OP NTA and I would set the boundaries NOW that this is your wedding and not theirs to control. They are offering financial assistance, but do not let them use that as financial abuse and control. If they follow through with their wishes on your day, you will look back on your wedding with sadness instead of the happiness that it should be. \n\nFirst I would get his friends cut off that list ASAP and stop your parents from making any more decisions for you. They cannot be trusted and if they threaten to pull out of financing then you will make it work without their help and without their presence. Trust me! Your friends and other family will step in and help you make it. You CAN do this without your parents money if you need to. \n\nCongrats on the upcoming wedding and good luck with the parents.", "NTA  \nTake back the guest list. Order more invitations. Tell his friends they aren't invited. Take the seating chart back & don't allow him to see it. Invite your friends. Tell him you can handle this.", "Pull the  plugg on this wedding and only have a small one with  his parents, sibling, your sibling and that be it.  You dad is going destroy this like everything else he touches.", "NTA. Unfortunately, you can't have your cake and eat it too. \n\nBy helping financially with the wedding, your dad thinks he has a say. He shouldn't. It's your day and his demands are selfish and how he's going about it is extremely disrespectful. If you don't want his input, don't ask for financial or any help for that matter. \n\nAlso, if you don't want random people showing up at your wedding, you better put down some boundaries/possible consequences (\"You will be asked to leave the venue if you bring anyone not on the guest list\" etc.)", "NTA for standing your ground but YTA for taking their money and letting them \"help\" you. Parents and wedding planning should never exist in the same sentence unless you are happy having no opinions.", "NTA but he paid for the wedding so unfortunately he feels entitled to run the show.

You KNEW they are shitty people. They behaved EXACTLY as you would expect them to behave.\n\nIts not like they blind sided you. Or that this behaviour was new. Or you didnt know what would happen. You wrote all of this - \n\n>I\u2019ve always had a rocky relationship with my dad. He\u2019s a high functioning alcoholic and was verbally and emotionally abusive my entire childhood and was unable to be there for me in any meaningful way. We aren\u2019t close and I don\u2019t talk to him much. But he still expects me to listen and obey everything he says.\n\n....and yet you decided to take their money. Your parents are AH because they are truly awful people. You are an AH because you got greedy and decided to overlook a history of abuse for a free dream wedding.", "YEP this is it.  ESH.  You accepted their money KNOWING they were going to take over aspects of planning.  The only way to prevent this is to give them back their money and tell them their \"help\" was appreciated but you're going in a different direction and you are NOT inviting your father's friends to the event YOU are paying for.", "Is it that hard for parents to just leave the event that's about the child for THEMSELVES, even though they are paying? What the \"dad\" did is unacceptable and inexcusable.", "Ok good. Now you need to cancel everything & give back all the money you can recoup. Then take a time out with your other half, no wedding talk at all. Then after a month or longer, talk about what you actually want and remember it\u2019s the marriage that counts not one stupid day.", "By her own admission, he has a history of being abusive, an alcoholic, absent parent who expects their child to obey everything they say. \n\nHe behaved exactly as you would expect him to behave. She on the other hand, should not have taken the money.", "She can't, but it is her duty to protect her children...", "She's right about that, so she has to think about who she would rather make happy. Her daughters or her alcoholic and abusive husband?", "Agreed. Best would have to have gotten it out of the way early. Ask ahead if there\u2019s any stipulations. That way OP could have reflected the money at the start, or shut any expectations early", "A part of you will always believe/hope that they've changed if that makes someone an asshole then we all are.", "Well right, she can't make everyone happy so she needs to think about who should be making happy when helping with her daughter's wedding hint hint it's NOT creepy dudes.", "You can absolutely hope for the best.
