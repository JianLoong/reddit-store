My sister dated her ex for ten years. I was 18 when I first met the kids. I\u2019m 28 now if that\u2019s helpful. \n\nDuring the last ten years, I was an uncle to the kids. I made sure to spend quality time with them, be there for them, spend my Christmas\u2019s, their birthdays, etc. I have even dressed up as matching costumes for Halloween, while living across the country and defending my dissertation. I helped my nephew get into college. \n\nWhen my sister had a baby, things went south. It was clear that she and my parents saw that kid as her \u201creal kid\u201d and saw my other niece and nephew as burdens. When my sister gave birth to her now 4 year old, she neglected the kids at home. I had to come stay at her house, feed them, make sure they went to school orientation, cleaned her house, etc. \n\nMy sister went through two divorces with her ex\u2014they are now separated for good. My sister moved on fast, already engaged to someone new. She has two kids she birthed herself (2,4) and the two she took care of during her marriage. \n\nThe second divorce happened in Feb. I drove down to see them (I live far away) this week for Thanksgiving. I spent time at my cousin\u2019s wedding, with my parents, my sister, her new partner, my own partner (we went and explored the city for a day to ourselves), I took my sister\u2019s 2 and 4 year old out for a full day of fun at the zoo, aquarium, playground time, etc. I paid for everything. I invited my sister but she didn\u2019t want to come. She kept becoming busy picking out new carpet with her new fianc\u00e9e. \n\nI didn\u2019t mind paying. I love time with them. It was my sister\u2019s day with the kids (the ones she birthed), but she had me drop them off at her ex\u2019s house. \n\nNext day comes, and I prioritize hanging out with my now 15 year old niece. I took her to downtown New Orleans. My wife and I took her to art galleries, museums, all based on her interests. She loved it and I got her lots of gifts during. I drop her off and my sister is mad at me. \n\nShe posted on FB \u201cthat blood might make you a relative but loyalty makes you family\u201d. My parents are mad and say \u201cyou treat those kids like they are your nieces or nephews or something? Like they are family and we aren\u2019t?\u201d \n\nI woke up to messages from my extended family telling me how terrible I am for taking my sister\u2019s ex wife\u2019s side. \n\nI tried really hard to make time for everyone this trip but prioritized the kids. I do see both my 15 year old niece and 17 year old nephew as my niece and nephew.

Bless you \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udd6f\ufe0f *you* know what family truly means. Thank you.", "NTA.  At all... Your sister sounds like a real peach", "NTA. A decade is a long time. I assume the kids\u2019 bio mom is fine with you still being their Uncle? Sounds like your family is being petty and not keeping the kids\u2019 best interest in mind.", "NTA, and that's convoluted and messy.\n\nYou should not be expected to punish or ignore your sister's ex's kids who were part of your family. They definitely have no business dictating who you and your wife decide to spend time with.\n\nAnd sounds like you still are active and involved with your sister's biological kids as well, so this just stinks of sour grapes family drama that your sister's stirring up.", "NTA, 10 years is a long time. The kids must love you you sound like a fun uncle.", "NTA - your family sounds super delightful. (Sarcasm). You don't owe your family anything. You view those kids as your family and want to spend time with them. They probably really appreciate that someone other than their bio mom shows them love and attention. Your family, however, has no loyalty. What kind of family just drops kids like they don't matter? Blood or not, that's shady.", "NTA, my mum and step dad were together for a long time and they split up when I was 17 (I'm 19 in a couple weeks) and yet he still spends time with my siblings and me and he helps us when need be. You are spending time with your neice, there is nothing wrong with that.", "You love the kids. Anyone who tries to marginalize that is seriously fucked up.", "\u201cthat blood might make you a relative but loyalty makes you family\u201d\n\nAnd I bet your nieces and nephews will all agree.\n\nNTA.", "kids are the collateral damage of your sisters and her exes inability to commit to one another.  you dont divorce kids in my family.  My husband is still \"brothers\" with his ex stepbrother after their parents short marriage ended.  They are closer than the blood relatives are.  Thank you for not punishing your niece and nephew for their parents failed marriage.", "NTA.  \n\nYou aren't 'taking a side'.  Or put better, you aren't on her side, or the ex's side, you're on the kids' side.  They are innocent in all this, they have no control over the situation.  So you and your wife show them that there are SOME people in the world who just care for them and want them to be happy.  \nThat's not an affront to your sister.  That's not choosing her ex.  That's just being a good person.  \n\nI suggest tell her and anyone else-- you are not on the ex's side, you are on the kids side.  It sucked for them to lose your sister and you don't want them to lose you too.  This has nothing to do with any adult relationships, the adults can do whatever they want and it's not your problem.  You are just there for the kids, and anyone who would suggest punishing the kids or deny them attention because of what the adults are doing is wrong and should really re-think things.", "NTA. Your sister was right. Blood does not make a family. You obviously love and care for those two kids even if she doesn't, and perhaps never did.  You made them a part of your family even though they aren't blood relatives and even after all the shit with their parents you remain a good and stable influence in their lives. \n\nThat says a lot about you as a person, and you are definitely not an asshole for continuing to care for a couple kids who have had an otherwise rough and inconsistent family life.", "NTA. Your sisters FB post sounds about right. And well, your family sounds nice. Your relatives like major AHs.", "NTA. It\u2019s not like your forcing your sister to spend time with them", "NTA, but some of your family sure is. Did they suddenly start to behave badly to the older two? How are they going to act when the littles talk about their siblings? Try to deny them?", "NTA. You don't owe anybody an explanation for what you do with your time and your money. And also you're not taking the ex-wife side you're taking the children side there's a big difference, and if your sister isn't mature enough to understand that then your sister isn't mature enough to be a mother or be in a relationship.", "NTA - you are the best uncle these particular kids could wish for. Your niece has told you that - you make her feel loved. That shamed the rest of your family, who have encouraged their mother (your sister) to abandon them, and the family have done the same. Of course your mother doesn't like that you shamed her. That doesn't mean that what you did was wrong. I'd suggest you do some research into the concept of a \"chosen family\" because that's what you and your niece and nephew are - people who aren't related by blood but by choice (and loyalty, as your niece says).   \n\n\nIgnore the rest of the family, keep being there for your niece and nephews, and keep being the great uncle that you are!", "NTA.  This only counts as \u201ctaking sides\u201d if your family thinks these kids somehow became the enemy when their parents got divorced.  Ask them if they\u2019re really proud of acting like you\u2019ve only got so much love and support to go around, or why they think they *should* get first dibs if this is how they\u2019re going to behave.", "I love the fact that her fb post backed you up lol. \u2018Blood makes you relative but loyalty makes you family\u2019 \u2026.. NTA keep being an amazing example to these kids. They obviously need someone like you", "OP=NTA\n\nThey were your niblings for ten years, that's a long term relationship, why shouldn't you spend time with them(since I presume the ex has no problem with this)?\n\nAlso the 17 yr old is almost a legal adult and therefore has every right to choose their friends & family.\n\nYour sister(and sadly your parents) are miserable human beings. That they just abandoned/disowned children who'd been a part of their life for TEN years.  \n\nKeep being you, OP and ignore these jerkwads.", "NTA  & how or who you spend your time with, isn't any of HER business.

My brother and his wife went on to have more little ones themselves and sadly, as it often happens, there was a falling out between them and my niece because now there are new babies and she is inconvenient. I never lost touch with her even when none of them spoke to her (they have since reconnected). Should my brother and my SIL ever divorce, it will never change my relationship with her.
