But I also think you cannot possibly understand the trials some women face in bad marriages with abusive husbands.  It sounds like it's been years.  You don't need to forgive her immediately, but you do need to start the process of moving on, and going on the offensive is not the path to that.

The time to say I\u2019m sorry and MEAN IT and SHOW IT with this woman\u2019s actions has long since passed.
