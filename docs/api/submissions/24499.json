But I also think you cannot possibly understand the trials some women face in bad marriages with abusive husbands.  It sounds like it's been years.  You don't need to forgive her immediately, but you do need to start the process of moving on, and going on the offensive is not the path to that.  For those reasons, YTA now.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are right: Your mom was his enabler, making it possible for him to abuse you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"She said she was in a tough place with no option. \" .. That's NOT true.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are fine not to have a relationship with her.", "Abusers are the reason abusers exist.  Enabling abuse is wrong but giving them responsibility for the abuser's actions is worse.", "Speak to a therapist, yes. But you NEVER owe an abuser or their enabler forgiveness. The time to say I\u2019m sorry and MEAN IT and SHOW IT with this woman\u2019s actions has long since passed. If she truly understands and is sorry for the trauma she put her kids through, she will also understand her adult children still being angry with her.", "Frankly fuck that noise! His mom is just as bad as her father and she obviously had a safe place to go if she was sending her son to live with her parents. It\u2019s called fuck around and find out. She can die lonely", "Enablers are just as bad as the abusers. If you haven't been the child in that situation, you won't understand.", "I\u2019ve been in therapy off and on but I should probably go back and talk about these new developments", "You are pushing OP in one direction with a lot of assumptions that are not in this post.  You should be more respectful of OP's autonomy.", "Ironic.

My intent was to show OP that as much as the world might push forgiveness and the opportunity to mend things with an abusive parent or their enabler, it is not required and it is perfectly okay to still be angry and upset.", "NTA\nYour mom's failure to protect and support you was also abuse and neglect. She wasn't just his victim. She allowed the children to live in pain and fear. She failed in her duty as a parent. Instead, she taught you to accept abuse, blame yourself for triggering it, and try to control it through your behavior- which is impossible. You have a lot to be angry about with your mom. Your feelings are valid and well founded.", "The people who are telling you to reconcile  were not living with you as child.  I can not image in pain, the anguish the trauma you and your siblings endured.\n\nYour sister was in your house growing up.  There was a reason why you and your sister celebrated the death of your father.\n\nHave you talked to any of your siblings?  I think those are the people that matter, not you extended family.  \n\nAs a warning, even thought you and your siblings were raised together, you may have different thoughts, different experiences about your childhood.  \n\nI was was raised with three older sibs.  The oldest two had different experiences, different memories, than I had.  Parents change their parenting styles for different kids.  \n\nYou do not have to reconcile with you mother.  You know that she enabled your father.  You do not have to put yourself through that mental anguish.\n\nNTA", "Was she abused?", "I do understand that after such a childhood you have such a trauma, but even if you never speak to your mother again I would suggest you ask yourself if your mother wasn't as much a victim of your father as you were. Abusers destroy their wife/husband first before starting on the children. I read \u201cstop crying because that makes daddy mad\u201d  as fear from her part as well. \n\nI did voluntary work at a place dealing with abused women and your story reminds me of some of the women I saw there, which is why I am raising that possibility. \n\nNTA", "You were both victims of abuse. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to accept her back into your life, but I urge you to read up on domestic violence and its effects on the entire family, including the \u201cenabling\u201d parent, as you put it.\n\nNAH.", "YTA. You don\u2019t have to be besties with your mom but you could forgive her and treat her how she should\u2019ve treated you all those years. It\u2019s just words but it means more than you might think. Making decisions for a family can be very hard and coming from a home full of alcoholics myself, my mom had to make very difficult sacrifices I can\u2019t imagine having to make. Basically, people make bad decisions, not because they\u2019re horrible people, just because they\u2019re human. You\u2019ve made your point to her how the decisions she made created a hard environment for you to grow up in, but is it really worth keeping your mother out of your life to spite her for not leaving your father? You know they both loved you, that\u2019s why they had you in the first place. Was your dad really homophobic or was that behavior the product of his upbringing and alcoholism which he clearly used to cope with some maladaptive mental health issue? Did your mother not give you an existence? How do you know you would\u2019ve been any different if you had your father\u2019s life experiences? I understand you\u2019ve had it rough to say the least, but to disown your mother because of what happened growing up, seems a bit too far no? Call her what you will for not standing up to your father, but she still wants to be a part of your life. Considering what your father put your family through, I think you both deserve to have a proper relationship now. I don\u2019t think this is even a matter of A holes or not, more so just simple facts of life, your life is going to only be harder than it needs to with that emptiness in your heart towards your mother. There\u2019s no utility in that resentment, only more bitterness and despair. Do for your mother what you wished she should\u2019ve done for you, not because she deserves it but because you don\u2019t deserve to live under the shadow of the family dynamic that once was. That\u2019s the whole point of bringing life in the world. With death, new things grow. I say stop letting the past haunt you and let something new grow. It\u2019s easier than letting her go and only realizing how miserable it made you when you\u2019re on your death bed.", "NTA\n\nEnabler is an actual term. They're abusive if they let their partner hurt their child without doing anything about it. I recommend reading r/raisedbynarcissists because this is a popular dynamic. Your father doesn't have to be a narcissist for you to read it. Again, the dynamic is just popular. \n\nLet's reframe this. Take away the word Mom. What would you do if your partner was acting like your father to your child? Would you stand by as they abused them just like your mother? If not, why would you be defending your child?\n\nAnd after allll of this. Ask yourself, Is someone who doesn't defend their child a good or bad person?", "Nope. Take time to process the trauma. Know that he is gone. Deal with mom when you are ready. You owe her nothing. I release, YOU OWE HER NOTHING! \n\nMom's job was to grow healthy children, to protect them, to nurture them. It doesn't sound like she invested a lot of any of that to her children. \n\nNTA", "Your mother did NOT protect you as a child, from your drunk father.  You had to actually go live with your grandparents.\n\nI almost never tell people to go \"no contact.\"  I'm not telling you to do that, but I would advise that you keep a pretty low profile with your mother, and keep the relationship within strict boundaries.  Do not give her any financial support and don't let her bleed you in other ways.", "You are never the asshole for setting boundaries and not allowing your abusers to share in your life. No is a complete sentence.", "NTA and I hope you get some therapy to help you heal. Your mom should have protected you.", "NTA.  Absolutely NTA!\n\nIf your family is unable to accept & respect your answer and can't let it go, I think that tells you all you need to know about them.  \n\nSome things in this life are NOT forgivable, end of story.  She made her choice, and it wasn't her children.  Choices have consequences.", "NTA and yes your mom bares some responsibility but I wouldn\u2019t expect your relationship with her is ever going to be easy.  She allowed your fathers behavior at a time when you REALLY needed her to speak up the most regardless.  That type parenting failure can rarely be completely forgiven.  Also anyone that tells you that your being cold should be told to fuck right off.  They have no idea what you went thru.", "If you have to come up with some weird definition of forgiveness that doesn't involve forgiving, why don't you just call it something else? I'm genuinely asking because I have no idea what you're talking about, if you can't be in the same room with them, you haven't forgiven them. So what have you done?"]}
