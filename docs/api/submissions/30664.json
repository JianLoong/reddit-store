The way you talk about her, including discussing her weight, which seems irrelevant... \n\nYou just seem like an unpleasant individual and an unreliable narrator.

I\u2019ve set her up 6 times to speak with a mental health professional which she agreed to, she didn\u2019t/ refused to attend any of the appts. I tried talking to her about what was going on I always got a generic response, and that's ok, maybe she wasn't ready to talk.  I\u2019ve also asked her dad to talk to her about it many many times.

I wasn't trying to make this about her weight at all, that wasn't the point I was trying to make,  I am tired of smelling her throughout my home, sorry if I take pride in my home as one should.", "NTA. Why is a 23 yo woman in the house all day everyday?. Why is she not attending to college or working at all?? The father have to go and find professional help for him and his daughter.", "NTA.  You really have a husband problem.  This is his child and he has not set nor made her adhere to rules.  You two should have bene having discussions about this situation long before now and boundaries should have been set with her.  He should have been asking her what is going on and offering her therapy.  That does not excuse her behavior.  We had rules for adults living with us, clean up after yourself and take care of yourself.  If they refused to do those things there were repercussions and if they did not like that, they were welcome to move out.  If adult children cannot express common courtesy, they can move out and learn what the real world is like.  I know a lot of people are saying she is depressed.  That maybe true, but she is an adult and also has not sought out help or therapy.  That is on her.  I am tired of it being used as an excuse for everything.", "Honestly, I think YTA, because I'm going to read between the lines on this one. You've had a young woman in your home for 18 years that is seemingly struggling. You make zero mention of her responses or reactions to any of this, so I'm guessing she's used to shutting down because of constant criticism and being yelled at. Sounds like dad does the same thing while your raging, which I'm going to guess is frequently.\n\nThis is a mess. Sounds like she is 1000% dealing with untreated mental health issues (that's not a defect- it's no different than having a heart condition or eczema - it just requires treatment and lifestyle changes that are difficult to force on someone).\n\nIt's also super weird you told her she'd have to learn to take care of her hygiene \"more intensely\" than most because of her weight- did you seriously say that to a child?? I'm going to guess fat shaming has been a regular thing in your home. \"Clean freak\", lots of \"I\" in this post, admittedly going off on her and your husband. It sounds like your husband doesn't bother, because there's no way he's going to win with you anyways.\n\nNo comment on what she does, if she works, etc. Two younger kids so I'm sure there's some aspect of \"I'm just the unwanted other kid around here who is fat, oh well\" and is living up to your view of her. You've been in her life since she was 5 and you don't sound like you have any love, care, or concern for her at all (other than her being perceived as dirty/fat). Instead being worried about her well-being and happiness, all you care about is your clean house and whining about your sensitive nose. You give her (and your own husband) an \"ultimatum\" - an ultimatum would be \"if you don't keep your room clean of trash and dirty plates, you will need to find somewhere else to live\"- this isn't an ultimatum, you are kicking her out. Does she have the means to do that? Do you even care?\n\nI get that there are lazy, entitled people out there who don't care, but that isn't the vibe any of this story gives. This story gives MASSIVE \"other side of the story\" vibes that would paint you in a much different, less-victimy light.", "NTA  And if the trash includes husband then time to take it all out!", "NTA. Good for you. There\u2019s no sense in her being that way. I wouldn\u2019t put up with it at all. Husband doesn\u2019t give a crap. Stick to your guns.", "NTA.

When that doesn't work, you go on a rage fueled rampage.\n\nYour husband is totally passive.\n\nWhere is her mother in all this? It sounds like SD was living mainly with her father and you. Is this correct?\n\nSD does sound like she has some kind of mental health issue. Has anyone ever suggested she get diagnosed  or treated?\n\nYou say this began when she was 18. Was she encouraged to go to school or get a. job?\nOr was the attitude that she is an adult now, not our problem.  Or is it a coincidence that this was the same time that the new baby made an appearance? Did some other change happen when you were pregnant that disrupted her life?\n\nHave you and your husband ever sat down when you were calm to discuss the situation?", "Nta\nSomeone at some point failed in their duties as a parent\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t sound like it was you - if you get what I mean", "Ya know at first I was gonna make a judgement but now I\u2019m on the fence. \n\nWeight aside the destruction to the house and stink is a problem. Seems like you tried to help and the fact that her own mother doesn\u2019t care says a lot. Even her father doesn\u2019t give a damn. Sucks that you have to be the \u201cbad guy\u201d in this situation.", "NTA based on your additional comments. The weight thing was a bit shitty, but if you've truly tried to make her mental health appointments and her parents are clocked out, what is there to do? She's gross and if you can smell the rooms she has entered, that's pretty foul. She may very well have MH problems, but if she won't make the effort to fix them then there's not much you can do. She's 23. Time to get dropkicked out the nest if she's not willing to apply *any* effort to adulting. Otherwise you'll have a rancid 40 year old rotting in your home because both of her parents refuse to step in and you have minimal impact.", "ESH. \nShes a lousy housemate, that's clear. \n\nYou are sort of her parent here. When my sister was at her \"laziest\" as far as house work, she was also her most difficult socially. Turns out she had been silently suffering after an assault and we had no idea. When people don't look after themselves, something is very wrong.\n\n Maybe the 90 day warning will help, I hope she also gets the support she clearly needs.", "Sounds to me like there could be a communication barrier. Maybe talk to her without screaming or judging about the mess to really see what is going on. Hold her accountable for working & doing her chores, maybe even set ground rules since she\u2019s living under y\u2019all\u2019s  roof. Ex: no eating in the rooms, or no cups in the room. Set the standard for all in the house. She\u2019s 23 so she\u2019s not a child & should be held accountable. I can see where as a neat freak you would go crazy seeing a mess like this. However, it\u2019s not healthy for her to be smelling so poorly & if she isn\u2019t able to hold down a job then she has a lot going on. Maybe set a rule that she has to seek therapy as well?", "NTA, sounds like a lazy stepdaugther and lazy husband that does nothing for her daugther.", "INFO: You keep saying \"my home\" in multiple sentences. Did the husband and the daughter move into your house that you were living in or did you move into their house after the marriage.", "I just wanna know how sleeping until 10am is seen as bad? It\u2019s 10 in the morning lol that\u2019s still early for a lot of people. Being a morning person doesn\u2019t give you power, some work better at night.", "What you describe sounds a lot like depression.  Not just the blues, but an inability to get motivated to take care of herself, likely despite a want to.  Sleeping late, poor hygiene, etc.  I wouldn\u2019t attribute all of this to that, some probably is laziness too.\n\nMaybe NAH?  All that said, no one should have to deal with an adult\u2019s funk or clean up after them.

But FYI, Reddit is the absolute worst place to ask about parenting.  The average redditor age is mid 20s, so not a lot of experience here with parenting. I've seen a lot of unjustified Y T A judgements and I think it comes from a lack of experience. Is it possible you were too hard on her about her hygiene when she was growing up? Yes. But that's not what you're asking for judgement for. You telling your 23 stepdaughter it's time to move out is NOT an asshole thing to do. If you hadn't mentioned the hygiene thing, you would not be getting so many ah judgements. You'd be hearing things like \"your house, your rules\" and \"she's an adult, she can move out\". Those things are still true regardless of these judgements.", "Absolutely not. Damn you're a Saint. I could not, would not be able to live with that nasty smell.\n23 is old enough to know better, especially when you helped raise her with kindness and concerns with her weight.

Maybe ask her if she wants help tidying it up or see if she wants to speak to a doctor. It sounds like she has depression honestly, I know hygiene takes a huge hit sometimes when depression hits. \n\nFor me, I like clean spaces but it's very hard to both keep it clean and tidy up. I have ADHD and cleaning can be a huge task that overwhelms me and so I end up putting it off for ages. I had a messy room for a while, hadn't changed my bed sheets for a while and I just couldn't clean it. I wanted to, but couldn't. My brain wouldn't let me. \n\nThen suddenly, I got hit with a cleaning hyperfixation and I got it done after months of mess. I've just turned 25. Ask her if she needs help. Maybe she's embarrassed by it and looking at it makes it worse but she can't do anything about it because her brain won't let her. The mess and poor hygiene makes her mental state worse, getting yelled at and shamed by you makes it worse, being told she's losing her safe place in 3 months will absolutely make it worse. \n\nShe needs help. \u2764 Good luck and I hope it works out.", "NTA", "NTA...she's old enough to clean behind herself.

Obviously none of us know OP and her family and this post is a bit hard to read.\n\n\nStepdaughter seems like she may have some sort of untreated mental health issue like depression, which can explain some of the problems OP has been having. I have depression and some days it can be hard to even get out of bed. Even if she doesn\u2019t have depression, she should probably have some sort of therapist or doctor intervention if she isn\u2019t taking care of herself at all. Has she communicated to you or your spouse that she\u2019s unhappy or needs help? A little help from her family could make all the difference here. And while I don\u2019t want to be one of those \u201cshe should just get better\u201d people, if her mess stops being just in her spaces and is effecting other people without, then she is becoming an AH too, at least inadverdently.\n\nYour husband should be the one primarilly responsible for her care as the biological father, and should support you as his wife with some of the chores, especially those that need doing because of his daughter. He should also be the one responsible for talking to his daughter about setting up medical intervention. \n\nOP, I understand your frustration.

I do think that she has a condition. It does sound like a combination of failure to launch and depression. The only cure for that is wanting to get better and having a support system around you. Doesn\u2019t sound like anybody hold her accountable for anything. Having been where you are at and knowing that you have reached your limit, it sounds like you are NTA.

I am wondering if OP's tone would be different if this was written 2 years ago, 4 years ago, or even 5 years ago when stepdaughter turned 18. It's very increasingly frustrating to feel like you are trying to do your best to help someone improve their quality of  life and it seems like they are not progressing in the slightest bit.  If OP is throwing in the towel after 5 years I can completely understand the frustration and not living in peace in her shared home would make anyone upset if it was them in OP's situation. \n\nOn the other hand if OP has been obsessed and critical of stepdaughter's weight or has treated stepdaughter differently from OP's bio children all their lives then I would judge OP is the AH.", "The girl is clearly sick. Not necessarily MI but something is wrong.", "Thank you.

I strongly suspect I have undiagnosed ADHD which makes focusing on things remembering tasks a chore all on its own. Just because I have these issues doesn't make it ok for me to leave dirty dishes around our shared living space and not wash myself. That's not fair to my partner who values having a clean home and puts in the effort regularly to maintain it.\n\n If you've done all these things and nothing is changing you can't really do much else beyond asking her to leave. This doesn't automatically make her homeless, she has a mom she can live with no? It might be mental health it might not be but it doesn't make it ok for her to act this way regardless and disrespect your home. If she truly is struggling then the option to seek out help has to be her choice. You can't help someone who doesn't want it or isn't ready for it. You made the offer and even did the step of making the appointment for her, and she agreed because it was zero effort on her part.... Until she had to actually go. Then she refused because that's effort and she's obviously not ready. So stop bringing it up, stop raging and pestering her because you're only wasting your own energy and good vibes by getting upset. You've asked her to leave, so now you leave the ball in her court. Make sure she knows you are serious that she has burned her bridges in your home and is no longer welcome to live there. She's not a child, she's an adult.

What ever you can do to show her some grace and make it easier for her to seek help will make it far more likely for you to help her deal with this as soon as possible. Threats and anger will only make her shut down and not be able to deal with her issues more, because she\u2019s likely already kicking herself and suffering internally so much regarding her situation. It sounds like she needs hope that there is a solution and things can get better, so my advice would be to try and be as optimistic and positive with her as possible.

It can be masked very well by bright kids and ones that aren't particularly disruptive and naughty.  Especially if they are girls.  Maybe read up on both ASD and ADHD (you can have one or the other or both and there are a lot of shared characteristics) in women and girls and how it can look for your own information and see whether there are parallels.  If there are, it's worth a talk with her but she may not do anything with the information.  Where this can be helpful though, is letting her know that a diagnosis is validation that her brain might work differently and the struggles she has are not abnormal, just different and it may help her accept some mental health support which will help her build some strategies to make her life easier.\n\nThe stuff around college and work is what's making me wonder this.  School is a very structured environment but college and other adult learning is not.  You need to have some self direction.

And an having a husband that's turned into an enabler.  Now he might be struggling too so I'd get a baby sitter for the younger kids (don't ask the 23 year old to do it) and go out and have a good heart to heart away from the house and really find out what's going on and how he's feeling with what's happening with his child.  He's probably at a complete loss at how to help her and overwhelmed himself and thinks he's failed her.\n\nIs he a good husband and father otherwise?  He can't be too bad if you've been with him for the last 18 years.\n\nSomething needs to change because you can't live how you are.  It's breeding resentment.  But she's going to need support.  Kicking her out isn't the answer either as much as you may want this right now.  If she was violent towards anyone in the house, then she would not be able to stay but you do have time here.\n\nThe two of you  (you and your husband) can also go to therapy together for strategies in how to help her.  She can join you but I'm guessing she won't but she might with time if the strategies you learn are helping.
