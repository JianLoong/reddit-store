We rent the main floor of the duplex, and a woman named Lisa (25F) rents the basement. The square footage is really similar for both of the suites, but we pay significantly more because we also get the deck in the backyard, and a small garden plot where we grow wildflowers. My wife and I are responsible for all lawn maintenance, snow shoveling, and any upkeep in the backyard. \n\nSince we moved into this duplex, we have been putting a lot of money into making our deck beautiful. We purchased patio furniture and a nice BBQ, we\u2019ve planted dozens of flowers in planters around the deck, we\u2019ve made an herb garden, and my wife even sewed all of the new pillow covers for the patio furniture when the other ones got old. We love this deck, and like to spend time on the deck in the summer. We have spent a lot of time and money making our backyard as cozy as possible. We live in a cold climate where we can only use our deck for a few months out of the year.  \n\nWhen Lisa moved in, she asked about the deck. We told her that we don\u2019t have a problem with her using the deck and our BBQ in the summer, as long as she asks us ahead of time so we can make sure that we don\u2019t have conflicting plans. She said that was fine. Lisa is aware that the deck is ours. She has not contributed anything to the deck or backyard since moving in.  \n\nToday, Lisa texted me and said that she would be using the deck tomorrow afternoon/evening for her birthday party (her birthday is tomorrow, apparently), and she would be using the BBQ as well. My wife and I had already made plans to have some friends over for drinks and then dinner on the deck. It would be at the same time as Lisa\u2019s event.\n\nI texted Lisa back and told her that my wife and I made plans to use the deck tomorrow afternoon, and that we were sorry, but she wouldn\u2019t be able to use the deck. She got upset at me and called me selfish, and said that she only wanted to use the deck for a few hours and I should have just made it work. \n\nMy wife thinks that I was the asshole for telling Lisa no, on her birthday, but the fact is that we put a lot of time and effort into our deck and I want to be able to use the deck when I want. I have been out of town for weeks, and just want to enjoy a nice night on my deck. \n\nI am annoyed that Lisa didn\u2019t even bother to ask ahead of time - if she had asked, we would have tried to work around her plans, but now it\u2019s too late to change them. Also, the last time Lisa used the deck, she left our BBQ absolutely filthy, even though we left our BBQ brush right beside it for her to use. She\u2019s also left garbage on the table before. \n\nSo Reddit, AITA for not letting Lisa use my deck?", "created_utc": 1690684468, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15d9zks/aita_for_not_letting_my_neighbour_use_my_deck/", "score": 128, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Presumably Lisa understands that her birthday is approximately the same date every year and she can make plans ahead of time to anticipate that celebration. You aren't an asshole because you made plans and she made conflicting plans without checking with you, I think you are completely right here, her failure to plan is not your problem.", "NTA. You were doing her favours by allowing your deck to be used at all. She did not bother to check in advance. I would suggest that as a result of this behaviour her right to ever use the deck are forfeited.  This way she will never be surprised...", ">Today, Lisa texted me and said that she would be using the deck tomorrow afternoon/evening for her birthday party.\n\nSo much wrong here - telling not asking, waiting til the last minute, when it's a birthday party, already proving that she won't clean up after herself, calling you selfish for wanting to enjoy your own property...What is your wife's problem, supporting this entitled behavior from Lisa?\n\nNTA", "NTA, it\u2019s YOUR deck that YOU paid for and she\u2019s contributed NOTHING to it. If she wants to use it she needs to ask like a week ahead of time, not the day before", "100% NTA. First of all your neighbor did not ASK for permission to use it, she told you that she had already made plans and that she WOULD be using it. That is very presumptuous when it is not her property. SUPER RUDE. \n\nThen add in the fact that the previous time she used it, she did not clean up after herself, that would have been more than enough for me to revoke ALL future deck privileges. She doesn\u2019t pay for it so she has no right to it. You did the right thing.", "NTA, if she really wanted to use it, she could have asked way ahead of time. I wouldn\u2019t let her use it again since it sounds like she doesn\u2019t leave it in the same condition as she found it.", "NTA. Lisa should have contacted you Atleast a week or more in advance. Has not cleaned appropriately in the past and shows a lack of maturity. This is why it\u2019s hard to let people use your stuff. No one respects it as much as the person that purchased it.", "NTA\n\nShe should have asked, not told you, and she should have done so at least a week beforehand.", "NTA.  It is your responsibility, and you are planning to use it.  She asked last minute as though it was a foregone conclusion, which strikes me as rude.", "NTA. She didn\u2019t give you enough of an advanced notice, she technically doesn\u2019t have any rights to the deck so she needs to be more polite and respectful about it and clean up after herself, how are you supposed to know when her birthday is? NTA NTA NTA. After the name calling I think I\u2019d cut off letting her use the deck all together. Take your willingness to share and be nice but then get demanding and rude and call names. Goodbye, hospitality over, keep off my deck forever.", "NTA\n\nHow entitled can you possibly get. She didn't ask whether she could use your deck - she \"notified you\" that she would be using your deck.", ">Lisa texted me and said that she would be using the deck tomorrow\n\nOh, she told you what she was going to do with your property?  Nope.\n\nTell her since she thinks you are selfish you are going to prove her right.  She is not allowed to use the backyard ever, don't bother to ask again.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Lisa didn't ask you, she stated, that she's going to use them. That's not how the deal was.", "NTA. \n\nBut wow, Lisa sure is! I can't even imagine telling someone that I'm planning on using their property like that. That's not even close to an ask. The entitlement is maddening.\n\nWe have a vacation cabin, it's small and in a very secluded area. Some friends of ours would ask (usually the male half of the couple) to use it once in a while. I had no problem, I just had some rules: always re-fill the firewood box and clean up. They never did either. Sort of pissed me off, but he was a good friend.\n\nThen one week the wife calls and says \"Yeah, Zippy, we're going to use the cabin this weekend, so I'll need you to drop the key off at my office.\"  Just like that. I was instantly pissed because of her attitude and the entitlement. I said \"Nope, sorry, that's not happening. We have other people using it this weekend\" and got off the phone quickly. I never let them use it again after that on their own. They'd go down there and camp while we were there but the cabin was off limits. There were some other really galling stuff she'd done, but that was the capper for me.", "NTA. Next time she'll want a party of 50 people.  Boundaries now, talk to your landlord if needed.", "NTA. She deliberately didn't ask in advance as she thought you might say no.  She hoped to corner you.", "NTA\n\nYou pay extra for the space, and you've maintained and furnished the space.  Not the neighbor.  Just how duplexes can be.", "She didn't ask, and it wasn't done ahead of time - end of story.\n\nNTA (but I am still unclear, is this about a deck or.... - j/k but 'deck' is on nearly every line of this post lol)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She made it clear she thinks it belongs to her because you tried to be nice, so now she should get NOTHING.  That or start charging her for any use of it from here on out.

You can't ask people on a days notice to give up the deck and grill for the neighbor's party.\n\nNTA", "She does not get to tell you when she will use your deck. It's ridiculous for her to think so and your wife is soft-hearted but very wrong.

She still shoulda made a reservation though", "NTA I am sure Lisa knows way in advance when her birthday is. She should have ASKED earlier.", "NTA lisa can do one.

Maybe the offer to use it should be taken off the table completely? But that could be going over the top", "Info: WTF is going on with your wife???", "Nta. You already saw she doesn\u2019t take her of your things. And if she\u2019s like that her guest are too. You pay extra for the deck. She doesn\u2019t get to just tell you she is going to use it with pretty much no notice. And how are you being selfish for using your own deck. It can be her bday but she still doesn\u2019t get to tell you what to do with the deck. Your wife is being too nice", "NTA.\n\nI will add, however, that its not entirely clear Lisa is intentionally being an AH from your account. I used to live in a duplex, and I never knew what my neighbors paid in rent. I suppose I might've been able to make a guess of it if both units had been empty when we moved in and I was able to choose between two empty units, but as it was, I rented the available unit. \n\nSo it's possible that while you're aware the duplex has an expensive and inexpensive unit, and the more expensive unit is the one that comes with access/ use of the backyard and deck, it's possible Lisa may have understood her rental situation more as, \"Your unit doesn't access the backyard or deck, so if you want to use them, you have to ask the upstairs tenants.\" It is possible she may not realize she pays less in rent as a tradeoff to not receive access to these common areas, and that her ill treatment of said common areas when she has been allowed use of them (the trash you mention) is a subconscious expression of resentment at being denied access from an area she may think is a tenants common area. \n\nOf course, that's a generous interpretation, and may be entirely off base. It's equally possible Lisa was clearly and unequivocally informed about her tenancy rights of access very clearly by the landlord when she viewed the rental, and again when she signed the lease, and she's just choosing to ignore information she doesn't like and act like she has a right to demand access when she feels like it.", "NTA, but it's time to tell Lisa that you don't want to let her use your deck any longer. No good deed goes unpunished.", "I would have told her no from the start. I find it weird having a neighbour use your private outside space. I\u2019m in the UK and to me, this would be the same as a neighbour asking me if they can use my back garden if they didn\u2019t have one. The answer would be no, it\u2019s my private garden. Weird. NTA but tell her it\u2019s no going forward as it\u2019s your personal space and to not ask again", "To me, TWO weeks notice is a lot more realistic.  If it's family, a week's notice is acceptable if a little pushy because, you know, life.", "NTA but you messed up.\n\nyou should have said no from the begining. This is not shared property.", "What everyone else said. Your mistake was letting her use it at all. If use of the deck and garden are not part of her tenancy, then she doesn't get to use them. \n\nThe fact that she TOLD you she was using the deck for her birthday instead of ASKING, and that it was last minute, shows that she feels entitled to it.\n\nNTA.", "NTA you pay for everything on the deck and the rent for having the deck.", "NTA and you should retract your generalized permission for her to use it. She now thinks that she has rights in your deck.", "NTA\n\nDon't let her use  the deck.  Ever. Once you do, she will \"forget\" to ask in the future. And you will always have problems with her when she wants to use  it.", "I don't understand why you ever said she could use your deck. You didn't even know her when you offered. It makes no  sense to me for you to offer a stranger the use of your home.\n\nShe has used it and didn't respect it, leaving it dirty. Why is the offer for her to use your home still open? I don't understand.", "Just combine the events. Have a big bbq and birthday party. Meet some new people. Have a few drinks with new potential friends and cool people. Everyone wins there and no ones a asshole.", "You forgot: Inviting people over before you secure the venue. That's shitty not just towards OP but towards the neighbor's guests too.", "Not to mention OP should charge a fee for clean up since she apparently can't even show enough respect for OPs property to clean up after herself.", ">Lisa may have understood her rental situation more as, \"Your unit doesn't access the backyard or deck, so if you want to use them, you have to ask the upstairs tenants.\"\n\n\n\nAnd when she commented on it, said tenants told her to ask ahead when she wants. Her birthday is not an emergency. It happens every year. She just made an assumption and is an A H for getting mad about an avoidable situation."]}
