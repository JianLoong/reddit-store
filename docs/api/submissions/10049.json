A girl came up to share her testimony about a guy saying creepy and sexual things to her at a party on New Year\u2019s Eve. She was crying and said that she didn\u2019t want to hide anymore and that she wasn\u2019t afraid to name names, and she accused one of my best friends (called him by his very unique name and year) of being the one who harassed her that night.\n\nNow, I recognized this girl because she tried asking out my friend back in November and he rejected her, which she was very mad about. And, my friend was at my house all of New Year\u2019s Eve and New Year\u2019s so I knew this girl was lying about it being him who harassed her at the party. There were only about thirty people in the forum room, so I was loud enough to call out and interrupt her and say my friend was with me that entire night so she\u2019s either confused about who harassed her or is trying to falsely accuse my friend. \n\nShe was taken aback and started yelling back at me, but the room kind of lost order because everyone started talking. One of the organizers came over to where I was sitting and told me to just leave immediately for disrupting the room.\n\nNow that I think about it, I probably shouldn\u2019t have interrupted her in the middle of her speech because it caused some disorder, but I didn\u2019t want the people at the forum to think false things about my best friend.

This is a very sensitive topic. If you were with your friend for 100% of the time that night and you can vouch for him with your own reputation, then NTA.", "NTA, warn your friend and report her for these false accusations. He could get in a lot of trouble over this...", "NTA. People who make false accusations are the reason real victims aren't believed.", "NTA. Her behaviour is weird and disturbing on so many levels.", "NTA.  False accusations are disgusting and incredibly damaging to real victims.  They give fuel to fire of deniers and predators.", "I think if she's accusing someone in public then she should be called out in public. What is handing it in private gonna do? People could start having speculations and run with their own ideas even if it's completely false. Stuff like that ruins people's reputation. Anyway NTA for sure.", "NTA\n\na podium is not a free license to tell extremely dangerous lies about a person.", "NTA, you were right to speak up and try to nip that in the bud. I\u2019m glad to see that you and your friend went to the school\u2019s DT. This could\u2019ve gotten really bad if nothing was said at all", "NTA, if you think about it nothing she saids can be true if one of the accusations is false in an eye of the law. So if she name dropping people then no one can trust exactly what she saids", "Nta.  \n\nCall out shitty people.", "NTA - based on what you are telling us she should be in serious problem for falsely accusing someone. Nowadays, with cancellation culture and everything, this can bring such serious consequences. I hope your university take this seriously.", "NTA, because a false accusation could ruin his life. If you genuinely are telling the truth you should report her for making those false accusations.", "NTA. She clearly had made up the story. So many women are victims of sexual assault and sexual harassment that people like her, make it difficult for the real victims.", "NTA also the organiser was more of an AH for telling you to leave. You did the right thing in protecting your friend. Usually after people falsely accuse someone of sexual harassment especially in university\u2019s, people would have been out for him most likely ruining anything he has.", "NTA. She was making a public accusal, A public rebuttal was necessary.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nFalse accusations like this are terrible for everyone. Obviously your friend didn't deserve this slander and hit to his reputation, but even more concerning is that lies like this cast doubt on actual cases of harassment. \n\nGiven you are positive she was lying, shutting this down immediately before it could spread was the right thing to do. I'll forgive the organizer for asking you to leave - they did not know the truth, but the false accuser is an absolute piece of trash.", "NTA\n\nFalse accusation regardless of female or male is just a disgusting act and deserves to be called out on. Was there maybe a better way of doing that? Maybe. But disorder is sometimes good, get the people talking instead of starting an echo chamber,", "NTA. This could ruin your friend\u2019s life. Not to mention false accusations take credibility away from those of us who have been victims.\n\nEdit to say he needs to get ahead of this. He could get kicked out of school. I don\u2019t know what needs to be done but I would start gathering any evidence you can get to prove he was with you at the time that was said. I\u2019m worried she will change her story since now she knows he has an alibi.", "NTA\n\nThose kind of false accusations can ruin someone's life and makes real victims less credible.\n\nYou were right to interrupt her and take up for your friend. I'd warn that friend, though, that this girl is saying this stuff.", "NTA. That girl pulled the kind of shit that makes people doubt SA victims that are coming forward. She is an AH for being conniving and petty, and the organizers are also AHs for kicking you out. \n\nFalse allegations like this should be a core topic to be discussed in such discussions because this affects a lot of people at a larger scale. Good on you OP for speaking out...and i'm glad your friend was with you so his story is cross checked with her account. I think he also has grounds to sue her. SH or SA claims are not a joke and can potentially ruin his life.", "NTA. I would tell your friend what is going on and to keep an eye out. Because something is not right here.", "NTA it was kind to defend your friend in a very charged environment. However, in the context of the space (discussing safety with regards to sexual harassment) it probably wasn\u2019t the best idea to shout out and interrupt. You would have probably gotten a better response by waiting until after she finished and then rebutted her dishonesty by speaking calmly. There were likely people in the space that have experienced sexual harassment and struggle to feel safe in sharing their experiences. Witnessing someone shout down someone they perceive to be another victim will only make them feel more unsafe.  So, the person who asked you to leave also wasn\u2019t an AH. The only AH is the liar.", "NTA\n\nI'd encourage your friend to file a defamation suit if possible.", "Frankly people that make false accusations should receive the same penalty as the other person would have gotten if convicted.\nETA NTA", "NTA as a victim of sexual assault, it\u2019s people like her that make the rest of us not get taken seriously.", "Nta that needed calling out innnediately", "Nta. Your friend wasn\u2019t there to defend himself so you did it for him. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she was already spreading this kind of misinformation already so definitely look into that.", "NTA from now own you probably should address things like this behind the scenes as you said in the end. However this is someone accusing someone you know couldn't have done it and I don't blame you for reacting in that moment, especially when false claims like this can take on a life of their own.", "First of all, the organizers of the bi-monthly forum should have had clear and stated rules about publicly stating names and any identifiable information about people in these events for the very scenario you describe.  YOU should have ***not*** been the person to object.  In fact, the girl should have never stated your friend's name.  \n\nAnd when she did, the organizers should have addressed this.  They are at fault, along with the girl.\n\nThis is the consequence of years of misogyny and abuse against women going unchecked until the *Me Too* movement.  Unfortunately, the pendulum has swung so far the other side that accusers are allowed to out people publicly with accusations that bear consequences *(i.e. social cancellation, lost jobs, lost friendships, threats, etc)* **without** proof and without a trial legally convicting someone.  \n\nWe should still treat people accused of misbehavior or a crime \"innocent until proven guilty.\"  It is much easier to level consequences on the guilty after they've been proven guilty than try to take back consequences for presumed guilty persons that later turn out to be innocent.", "NTA, but you could have called her out in a much more productive way. Wait until she finishes speaking, THEN call attention to yourself and calmly, in a neutral tone, explain to the room that you have an important statement regarding the accusation she just made. If your friend really has the alibi you said he does, the you interrupting her makes you sound untrustworthy to the room.", "NTA call this out when it's happening people. There was just a reddit story about a boy killing him self cause he was falsely accused and people harassed him. All those people may have jumped the gun and attacked your friend so it was good you called it out Infront of everyone", "NTA. Oh sure, take her side. I'm sure if it were a man speaking in front and naming names on women that \"sexually harassed\" him, then he'll be the one who'll be asked to leave.", "NTA", "NTA.", "Nta. Mud like that sticks and if you know it's false then she should be prepared to have it thrown back.", "NTA\nFalse claims of harassment are very serious and in my opinion you had every right to cut this farce short. \n\nAlso the room would have probably been just as chaotic, if you had waited for her to finish her falsified story. It being a safety forum setting and the topic being such a heavy one plus your alibi for your friend.. That would have caused a chaotic discussion regardless of timing.", "NTA - And if there are any negative consequences for your friend, he should look into suing her for slander.  If you have multiple witnesses that would testify for him, it shouldn't be hard to win.  \n\nAs others have mentioned, the university needs to make it clear that it's unacceptable to use a public forum to accuse someone of sexual harassment.  You should follow up with the campus activities office (or whatever university office oversees things like this) to let them know what happened and ask them to put a stop to it in the future.", "NTA. She was maligning your friend to a room full of people.", "NTA, she deserved to be called out. How dare she make a false accusation. She is why actual victims don\u2019t get believed.", "If everything you say is true, then you did the right thing. NTA", "ESH\n\nThe organizers shouldn\u2019t have allowed her to start naming names - this was not the time or place for that.  A safety forum is not the place to stand up and accuse anyone of anything, and this whole situation perfectly outlines why.  \n\nShe shouldn\u2019t have stood up at a safety forum and started naming names.  Not the place, not the time.\n\nOP shouldn\u2019t have been put in a position where they had to either interrupt and confront the girl then and there in front of everyone, or else let everyone go on believing their friend did harass this girl.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I had a girl I worked with, we became romantically involved with her telling me she loved me and was going to leave her fianc\u00e9 before their wedding blah blah blah.

She was angry I cut it off with her and was trying to get me fired. Needless to say it didn't look go for her, and eventually she got laid off when they trimmed back the workforce.

I would even take it a step further and dedicate my time to expose her in front of more people. I have no sympathy at all for people who make up false allegations for their own selfish benefit and wouldn\u2019t even care if the worst actually happens to them. It may be heartless and fucked up to think like that but I have no problems being heartless towards heartless people in general.", "NTA. If you know she's 100% lying and using her privilege to falsely ruin your friend's reputation, then you definitely aren't wrong for stepping in, even if it isn't easy and you know everyone will take her side.", "NTA", "NTA and girls like that are why the ones of us who actually experience it have a hard time talking about it. Yoy knew for a fact she was lying at least about it being him. She called him out in a room for of people and accused him of something quite bad, you rightfully defended someone who wasn't present to defend themselves and also your friend can have her for defamation if this causes him any issues. My brother was almost killed by an angry father of a daughter who accused him of rape after he refused to sleep with him. Her dad got arrested and was jailed for 6 months, my dad and brother go assaulted and the brother who was accused was almost run over by the father going 70kl an hour, missed him by a fleas dck. Lies like that can be so damaging. Apologies to the organiser but also be firm that what she did wasn't ok and just because a girl claims that doesn't mean it's true. I say this as someone who has been assaulted.", "NTA. Had you not spoke up, everyone there would have left thinking your friend harassed her.\n\nWhen a claim is made loudly, it should be okay to defend just as loudly.", "No, the main reason real victims aren't believed is that throughout history an awful lot of people have had a vested interest in undermining women's credibility - mainly men, but also women who feel more comfortable believing that rape and sexual assult are rare and avoidable.\n\nWhich isn't to say that false allegations don't happen  - but they are not the main cause of knee-jerk scepticism about women's allegations.", "The thing that makes me nervous about that is that police have in the past accused women of making false reports that later turned out to be true. There was a famous case here in Seattle where police charged a woman with falsely reporting a rape\u2014except she wasn\u2019t lying. Her attacker went on to rape several more women before being caught.", "What do you mean? I know it\u2019s not my friend because he was with me the entire night. Did you even read the post?", "Tell him what happened and encourage him to report her lies to the university. This could cause him a lot of trouble.

That is the reasoning given for not believing victims now, it's the defense used. It is the ready made excuse.

She didn\u00b4t want to file a report and get police involved, because they would ask questions, and since your friend was with you all night, the situation could have been diffused swiftly.\n\nInstead, she tried to meetoo him in front of the school and let others do the payback for the rejection. I don\u00b4t know about the legal situation, but i\u00b4d lawyer up and demand compensation.
