{"id": 27570, "submission_id": "16r8k96", "title": "AITA for telling my friend to stop telling us what to do with our future children", "selftext": "My friend Tara (32F), Pippa (32F, May (31F) & I (32F) always hang out together on nights out, lunches etc & have been friends since uni. \n\nIn the last few years I\u2019ve noticed Tara keeps trying to \u201cestablish\u201d, I guess is the word, that our future kids will be with us in future socialising. This might be okay as a light handed remark once or twice but this has become something she repeatedly mentions now as a subject she seems fixated on. And she only mentions it about the rest of our future kids, not hers. This might be because she\u2019s the only one not in a relationship or married like the rest of us are.\n\nWhen we\u2019re out she\u2019ll say \u201cSoon your kids will be here with us too\u201d, \u201cIn a few years it\u2019ll be with kids\u201d etc. She seems excited & happy about it in the way she says it. And yeah any future kids probably will be with us on some of the outings if appropriate & if everyone is on the same page about taking them.\n\nBut then she started saying it on nights out, the kind of outings that you would get a babysitter for & not take kids to. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a little you & you running around here in a few years here\u201d. Pippa & I took it as light hearted remark laughing & replied back that we wouldn\u2019t be bringing them to this kind of outing though, but Tara got serious & started saying yes you would, why wouldn\u2019t you etc. We said it\u2019s not really a kids appropriate outing & mom\u2019s need to be able to enjoy themselves with just the girls sometimes. Tara acted annoyed & very bewildered (is the only way I can describe it) & said how is it not a kids appropriate outing & why can\u2019t you bring them. This went back & forth for quite awhile getting way too weird & awkward for my liking & Tara wouldn\u2019t drop it becoming incessant.\n\nIn the end I said \u201cNone of us have kids or are pregnant so I don\u2019t know why you keep trying to tell us what to do with our non existent kids. When we do have them we\u2019ll do what we think is best for us & you need to drop the subject now\u201d. Tara acted shocked & got really pissed at me & is since making out i\u2019m mean *and* that I don\u2019t like children. I\u2019m actually really confused by the whole thing more than anything.", "created_utc": 1695589038, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16r8k96/aita_for_telling_my_friend_to_stop_telling_us/", "score": 30, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is very unusual behavior on the part of your friend, honestly. It does sound like maybe she is jonesing hard for a kid, and the rest of you aren\u2019t quite as enthusiastic about it (yet)? I would similarly be weirded out and would definitely have said something similar to you, if it\u2019s any help.", "NTA. This is very bizarre behavior, and I have to wonder if something personal happened to Tara to kind of trigger this (miscarriage, learning she's infertile, etc). You weren't wrong for saying what you said, but as her friend, i'd probably check in with her privately.", "NTA I think your friend, as you point out, is the only one, in your group of friends, not in a relationship and maybe motherhood have always be her big dream. She is probably suffering and expressing it in this crazy fantasy of kids at nightclubs drinking martinis from their sippy cups with mommy. Next time just say \u2018sure!\u2019. At the end they will get carded and sent back to the babysitter.", "Sounds like your friend wants kids REALLY BAD and is envious that you have partners and she does not. That being said, this behavior is weird and obsessive, not to mention her opinions are also weird. Who brings a baby to a bar??? \n\nNTA but you guys might have to minimize contact with this one because she's not going to hear anything you have to say in the way that you mean it.", "NTA I have to wonder if her constant mentions are due to her jealousy that you all have the immediate potential for carpet sharks. After all, she could be hearing the biological Big Ben, and not know how to express it in a personal way. Maybe just talk to her.", "NTA, but there is absolutely something going on with Tara.  Can you talk to her about it?", "NTA It's weird that she wants to argue over a hypothetical.", "NAH. I think what your friend is doing, in maybe her own weird way, is letting you guys know that she wants to stay in your lives when you become parents. She wants you to feel comfortable bringing your kids to outings. It\u2019s quite common when you have kids, that your friendships change. If you are all at the point in your lives where you could have kids and not her she may be worried about her place in the friend group. \nTruth is you never know what you will or won\u2019t be able to do with your kids until you have them so don\u2019t engage in hypothetical anything\u2019s with anyone about it.", "NTA - super odd behaviour and I reckon there is something bubbling away underneath all of that that your friend needs to work through.", "NTA.\n\nBut I'm wondering if since Tara is the only person who is single in the group, maybe she just wants to know she'll still have you all as friends if you were to have kids before she does. Maybe she's just afraid she'll be left out of things if/when you all become parents.", "NTA this is so strange", "NTA. I can understand how that would be weird and awkward to keep hearing.", "As soon as someone turns her head, Tara\u2019s bolting with that baby. She\u2019s the hand that rocks the cradle.", "It seems that\u2019s a likely possibility of the root of it. We never ever talk about having babies, getting pregnant etc nothing at all, we don\u2019t even touch on the subject slightly which might be unusual for women our age but it\u2019s how we\u2019ve always been. We do know we all want children one day but that\u2019s it. So it\u2019s not like any of us have ever contributed to her feeling left out of a hypothetical becoming mothers situation by talking about it or making her feel excluded. \n\nWe are aware one of us is actively trying & has fertility issues for years now (this may have contributed to us never talking about babies even after getting to this age), she never talks about it at all & has made it clear she doesn\u2019t want to, but we just know that much. So on that point alone Tara\u2019s behaviour is insensitive & unnecessary around her.", "Pippa asked her about it privately & she said the implication about me being against children & just repeated that she doesn\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with taking kids to things & made out we\u2019re being strange & making a big deal about what she said which is normal & don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to have children. Which we don\u2019t of course. And neither does she.", "That would be a wild night indeed, I\u2019m cracking up.", "It does seem like that could be the reason she\u2019s letting it out in such an odd manner. The rest of us never ever mention having kids (we all know we all want kids one day but that\u2019s it) or even bring up the subject in any way, so it\u2019s not like any of us have ever done or said anything to make her feel left out of a hypothetical situation. \n\nOne of the group even has fertility issues but never talks about it even though we\u2019d love her to be able to open up for her own mental health. That actually is another reason why Tara\u2019s behaviour is unnecessary & insensitive. \n\nShe even argued there\u2019s nothing wrong with taking a child to an outing that ends very late at night (as well as the inappropriate location aspect), at that point I felt like she was almost trolling us. But it seemed it was more about her being right & not wanting to back down & admit every single group outing won\u2019t & can\u2019t involve the future kids being brought along.", "Carpet sharks! Death from the ankles down!", "That certainly seems like something that makes sense to explain this. \n\nLike you said people without kids have no idea what they will or won\u2019t really do, & everyone will be different about that too, so the rest of us being forced to say what we would do is weird itself. But what\u2019s stranger is that we\u2019re actually telling her we would want to come out without kids & thus allow nights out in the similar way to now which should be reassuring to her & she\u2019s arguing against us doing that lol.", "This is a great answer. You\u2019re very perceptive.", "Oh gosh I feel like that adds an additional layer - insensitivity.", "Yeah, that's still just weird to me and I still think there's something else behind it. I still think it's worth checking in with her in private- not even confronting her about what happened, but just if something is going on that's making her bring this up so much.", "It also kind of sounds like she's trying to set up/guarantee that she has unlimited to access to everyone's kids. It honestly seems more and more like a mental health issue", "Ya maybe she is also sensing a shift in everyone\u2019s lives and is trying to process it or maybe come to terms with the shift in her own way. \nIt\u2019s hard to know what to say to her when she does that. You could shrug and say maybe, I doubt she will hold you to it. Or you could sit her down one on one and let her know the talk of future children and what you will do is stressing you out, but she can rest assured she will always have a place in your life."]}
