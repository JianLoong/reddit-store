Feeling great in your body doesn\u2019t mean your obesity isn\u2019t impacting your joints.  I felt just fine in my fat body but I constantly had pain in my lower body (hips, legs, knees, ankles, feet) and had trouble standing for more than a few minutes, despite being \u201conly\u201d 230lbs.\n\nI like the people in the comment section saying \u201cOP isn\u2019t a doctor\u201d but the friend isn\u2019t either.  She claims it has \u201cnothing\u201d to do with her being fat but she isn\u2019t a doctor and doesn\u2019t know that.  Nine times out of ten body aches and pains in obese people are directly related to their obesity.  I still have pain after I lost the weight, but that\u2019s because my obesity wore down my joints, and the pain is certainly less than what it once was.\n\nSorry if this hurts peoples\u2019 feelings, but being fat isn\u2019t healthy.  It just isn\u2019t.  If she\u2019s constantly binge-eating and her weight gain has been rapid, this will put even more strain on her legs, which probably haven\u2019t adjusted to carrying the new, excess weight yet.  Either way the friend needs to see a doctor, especially if the pain is new, but if the pain is coinciding with rapid weight gain then it\u2019s not unreasonable to assume that\u2019s the reason. When my parents expressed concern for me I got mad at defensive too, because literally no one wants to hear \u201cwe\u2019re concerned about your weight because you can\u2019t do anything without pain\u201d, but that didn\u2019t mean they were wrong.

What you are saying is that your friend is deeply distressed and is disordered in her eating. My guess is that the way she is eating is a reflection of her distress and *also* it is currently helping her survive. This can be hard for people outside a situation to understand, but self-harming behaviours are often a survival mechanism that allow people to manage their distress and function more-or-less normally a lot of the time. \n\nYour friend has a right to tell the story with her life and her body that she wants to. I've had clients with similar stories - often they are telling a truth about the world that they live in - that it is painful and that their bodies are sometimes the only place they are safe and sometimes an enemy that they want to destroy. They are telling a story about what it is like to be ambivalent about existing, about how dangerous being cared for and being neglected feels like.\n\nYour worry is yours.

Thermodynamics and calories-in-calories-out aside, for a very overweight person to sustain a weight loss is almost impossible due to the basal metabolic rate adjusting to compensate. Bariatric surgery and some newer medications have better results, but diet/exercise/lifestyle changes (though often producing significant health benefits) do not result in sustained weight loss. Study after study after study shows that 95-98% of people will gain the weight back, and more, within a few years.\n\nPeople absolutely should work on their mental health, eat well, and exercise, if that's what they want to do! Their lives and wellbeing will probably improve significantly but unless they also have bariatric surgery or use drugs like semaglutide, they will almost certainly not maintain a significant weight loss.", "Wow YTA, there are a lot of reasons that people have leg pain that aren\u2019t related to their weight.

All you're doing is letting your friend know that you're judging her based on her appearance 24/7, and that you don't like what you see. That's how people develop eating disorders- take it from a survivor. Not to mention hey, binge eating is a sign of an ED. It's a big part of it, some might say.

Maybe she's asthmatic. Could be nerve related. Could be bone. Could be muscle. Could be any number of things that have no real relation to weight.\n\nBe there for her, and love her, and help her focus on being healthy, not on losing weight, cause that's what matters.

And that's just the tip of the iceberg. \n\nYes, OP is TA, but blatant lies like this aren't helping anyone.", "Bollocks. I've told the OP they are wrong in a huge way but this is even worse. I am an expert in the area. Time to go back to your day job which is probably working at KFC.", "Define overweight, because I weigh 400lbs at 35 and I feel like I'm 65 most days.", "Yes we can, if someone is obese they are 100% unhealthy.", "But that\u2019s the thing, her friend isn\u2019t a doctor, so why not tell them to go see a doctor instead of telling them their body can\u2019t hold their weight?", "It really is, there is so much context missing so it\u2019s hard to come to a complete conclusion. Overall I do believe you cannot tell someone why they are sick or have pain unless you are a doctor. Which is why I\u2019m confused this person chose this route if they are really worried about their friend ya know.", "Telling someone their body can\u2019t carry their weight is an attack lmao. She should have been WAY more sensitive to her friend.", "Yes, it has absolutely nothing to do with the vast array of fast food chains and processed foods", "It's actually possible, since we are saving more and more children who would've died even 50 years ago", "People of all weights can get pain. It doesn\u2019t automatically mean it\u2019s because of their weight unless a doctor says otherwise. This person isn\u2019t a doctor.", "I think if OP cares for her friend they would talk to them about this afterwards and reword it to show they are worried about them. Ngl though if I was the friend and I saw some of the NTA people in this thread I would have a breakdown. Holy shit people are uneducated and brutal.", "Talking about weight shouldn't be taboo in appropriate circumstances sure,  but just informing someone they are fat is not an appropriate circumstance. People who are fat know they are fat, and it's painful to hear in those circumstances because that is not a constructive conversation, it's telling someone something they already know which serves only one purpose - hurting their feelings.", "But this could have absolutely nothing to do with her being overweight. You do however have to be a doctor to comment on someone\u2019s health. You can be a worried friend without having to equate it to her weight. And if they are worried, then sit them down, encourage them to lose weight. Just saying a comment like \u201cif you don\u2019t want pain lose weight\u201d is super out of pocket.", "Not common enough, considering the obesity epidemic and the subsequent billions of dollars being lost to it.", "or it\u2019s totally unrelated to weight", "So you admit OP jumped to conclusions but you still say she was NAH? \n\nI see you only did that to get attention from everyone in here, also by how you responded to the person you commented on your \u201cvote\u201d \ud83d\ude44\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Somethingphobic. I don\u2019t remember mentioning anything about any type of phobias but you do you. But yeah, when it comes to medical stuff it definitely should come from a professional who probably will check it a few times lmao. Like I\u2019m not gonna tell my friend with a headache she has brain cancer \ud83d\udc80", "> We don\u2019t mind sharing opinion, advice on anything, even if we are no expert.\n\nFeel free to share opinions, but why tf are you giving medical advice on things you don\u2019t know anything about?", "Well, according to 2023 logic, I need a doc to tell me not to smoke, and even then, that's smokerphobic. My coughing and breathing problems could be something completely unrelated. I smoke because I'm stressed and have a bad environment.", "This.", "I\u2019m glad your dad recovered. That must have been difficult. \n\nDid all the doctors tell him he wasn\u2019t sick, just fat, before they did even the most basic scans/blood tests/ect?\n\nIf it were me, I would honestly feel worse if I told my dad he was just fat and that\u2019s why he was out of breath so much. I mean, he died less than a week later due to undiagnosed heart failure but I\u2019m glad my last words to him wasn\u2019t \u201cYou\u2019re fat\u201d \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I am glad your father recovered and had the determination to lose the weight in order to receive treatment. \nJust fyi though, obesety unfortunately increases the risk of developing certain kinds of cancer because fat tissue produce estrogen. About 11% of cancers in women and about 5% of cancers in men are thought to be caused by excess body weight.", "You have to be a doctor to diagnose people with stuff though. I understand being honest, and agree it\u2019s definitely helpful in most situations. I don\u2019t think this was the situation for them to be honest with them though. I think they should have told them to go to the doctor, and if they are concerned about their weight and binge eating then that should be a separate conversation.", "she would have said obese then. and you don\u2019t need to share a bmi to see if someone if underweight or overweight.", "I mean she doesn\u2019t say obese though, and overweight is different to so many people so we can\u2019t really jump to conclusions here. I\u2019m not offended by what they said but I still think it wasn\u2019t their place to say it. Not to mention she is clearly struggling already and the OP could have helped in so many other ways if they really cared", "I disagree. Most overweight or obese people know it would be better for their health to lose weight. They don\u2019t need everyone they see to tell them that. OP was not helping, she was making her friend feel embarrassed.", "So will being a runner.", "I have chronic pain too and no one gives me weight loss advice. The chronic pain would still be there if I was fat and it wouldn\u2019t be because of my weight.", "Please re-read I said you can't tell solely on weight I didnt say weight can't be an issue I've known many a thin person have heart attacks and many bad health conditions weight is not the only factor in indicating health. Some are overweight BECAUSE of a health condition, it's not as simple as looking at someone to tell if they are healthy or not :)", "I don\u2019t disagree.  I also suspect OP and her friend are teenagers, though, and teenagers aren\u2019t exactly known for tact.  OP might have just been concerned and didn\u2019t have the tools to be able to express that better.  Hindsight is always 20/20.", "Agreed. About lack of sensitivity, not it being a personal attack.", "Not from obesity lol. I don't think that would have that effect.", "For sure, I\u2019m not denying that.  I had pain when I was overweight and obese and I had pain when I was underweight and I have pain now that I\u2019m fit.  I do, however, have far *less* pain now that I\u2019m not obese, and I\u2019m also aware that a good chunk of the issues I have now re: pain stem from the damage done to my body during the ten years I was overweight and obese.\n\nThe friend needs to see a doctor either way.", "Or you\u2019re in denial.  Trust me, as a former fat girl whose obesity destroyed her joints: nine times out of ten obesity is the root cause of pain like this.\n\nOP\u2019s friend needs to see a doctor either way.", "I personally don't believe what the OP did was particularly wrong, that's why I voted the way I did, and it has nothing to do with a \"bigoted\" stance I may or may not hold. I was merely pointing out the fact that me being called fat phobic was similar to how people are deriding OP for formulating an unprofessional opinion on her friend's health problems. Meaning it's ok for people to attack me and make assumptions but it's not ok for OP to make a judgement call (assumption) about her friend's health issues.", "\"My mouth bleeds when I eat glass\" \n\n  \n\"You should probably talk to a doctor about why that would happen, not only am I not a professional, but I lack critical thinking skills.\"\n\n \n\nIf a friend comes to you with an issue... health, relationship, computer, whatever it may be, they are looking for your opinion, not for you to go completely braindead and tell them to fuck off and talk to someone who gets paid to listen to their problems.", "Why not? They are my friends. They know I'm not a doctor and they are smart enough to know if they need to see a doctor or not. How dumb are your friends? lmao", "Thank you.\n\nOh yes, they always tell him that he should lose weight, move more, eat healthier, etc. The bias definitely exists. However the cancer was discovered and diagnosed through a routine round age general health check, he actually didn't have any complaints so no one was looking for it. \nHaving said that, should they have discovered it 6 months later, he would not have had the time to lose the necessary amount of weight for the specific surgery he needed.\n\nIt is a terrible, but a truly eye opening experience. Many of us will never even realise how quickly just out of the blue can everything go wrong. That we literally only have this one life and this one health we have to look after.", "That would be like me telling my friend they have brain cancer when they have a headache and to support it I say \u201cyou don\u2019t have to be a doctor to understand the risks of having a brain\u201d.", "Except these days nobody listens to the doctor when they say the same thing. It's shrugged off as medical fat phobia. So for everyone saying that a doctor needs to diagnose it, you actually think her friend will listen?", "Yes, running is often bad for joints and I'm sure if OPs friend was a runner then they would have pointed that out as a probable cause as well.", "And many people experience chronic pain from their obesity. If you complain about something, it's a pretty natural response for people to provide potential causes. OP is not a nasty person or fatphobic like many people seem to claiming just for suggesting a reason that their friend may in pain.", "You can\u2019t be healthy and obese at the same time. Yes you can have a normal weight and be unhealthy. Yes there are things that cause people to be obese.", "That\u2019s fair. They definitely should come out of this knowing better. We also don\u2019t know all the context, including how much this person weighs. Overweight for teenagers can be anything from 150lbs-250lbs (not from a medical standpoint but from what teenagers think overweight is). My friend weighs 146lbs and is 5\u20198 and was called overweight because she has a large ribcage and muscular thighs.", "I think it definitely comes off as a personal attack, because when she saw her friend was upset she doubled on it and went farther then necessary. Overall I think OP should apologize and if they truly care about their friend should talk to them in a better way that they care and are just worried for them.", "I agree if their friend has pain they should see a doctor. And see a doctor for their eating disorder as well.", "If you have a friend who\u2019s eating glass until their mouth bleeds, you absolutely should send them to a doctor, so I don\u2019t think your point stands.", "If she doesn\u2019t that\u2019s on her. Why does her being fat effect anyone else. It\u2019s on her if she doesn\u2019t help herself. But if she has a good doctor who\u2019s willing to listen to her concerns and actually go out of their way to at least check instead of just saying lose weight then that\u2019s the way to go. The reason medical fatphobia happens is because doctors are unwilling to actually look into things because people are overweight. And often times can misdiagnose people. You just have to find the right doctor.", "*Definitely* see a doctor for the ED, or a therapist.  I had a newly recognized form of BED called \u201cchew and spit\u201d where I would chew and spit out massive qualities of food to stop myself from swallowing it while I was recovering from the initial BED.  It\u2019s not fun and BED/other EDs can seriously damage your health, especially your teeth, which can affect your heart.", "Yeah, I\u2019ve been dealing with an eating disorder for so long and have just been diagnosed a few months ago after switching doctors because my last one would not help me even after I begged for anything. My new one immediately got on it and now im in treatment. Overall her eating disorder will probably be the biggest thing she will work on when she sees the doctor, because a good chance it\u2019s contributing to her weight as well"]}
