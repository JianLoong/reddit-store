It sounds like a mess to begin with", "NTA\n\nShe has been stringing you along, wasting your time, leaving you with likely no job, and you're wondering if you have a right to be frustrated and remove yourself from consideration? I would have removed myself after the first issue. If you're set on waiting until tomorrow, good luck. I would definitely ask for a lot of money, and get it up front. Imagine trying to get money from her after the fact. You'd never get paid.", "NTA, this seems like a disaster in the making. They are clearly not respectful of your time. Everything you have described makes me certain that if you took the position, you would end up putting in many more hours than agreed. They'd tell you they'll be home by 6pm, then not show up till 1am, without any notice and ignoring your calls. They'd call you at 9am on your day off to tell you to come immediately because they need to be somewhere else. That sort of thing. \n\nGoing forward, I wouldn't contact them again. You don't need to tell them you're no longer interested. Move on with your life and if they do call you for the position, tell them you assumed their lack of communication was not something you were comfortable with, so you made other plans.\n\nEdited to add: this whole thing seems to be designed to test your boundaries. Maybe they have several candidates and they are trying to see who would be the biggest pushover. So far, with you following up repeatedly after they rudely ghosted you, and being available to meet with a very last-minute notice isn't good. They're looking for someone they can take advantage of, to overwork and probably underpay. Don't be that person.", "NTA 100% you were professional, and she was not. The mom probably already had someone in mind and was stringing you along as a backup, total AH.", "NTA\n\nI get being busy but this goes beyond that.  I'd take her lack of proper communication as an indication of how it would go if you *did* become the sitter.  Imagine if you had an emergency involving one of the children and it was *hours* before mom responded (if at all).", "NTA, job interviews go both ways.  You are interviewing your employer to see if you want to work for them.  She\u2019s not even paying you yet and still already proving she is unreliable and hard to contact.\n\nWould she come home on time?  Would she be reachable in an emergency?  Would she be reliable with pay?  It doesn\u2019t seem like it.  Why would you WANT to work for her?", "NTA I would resign/not take the job.", "Welcome to the world of job hunting.\n\nThe job starts tomorrow and the parent takes days to respond?\n\nEither you don't have the job or, they're really disrespectful of other people's time.\n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
