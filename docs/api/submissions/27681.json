My kiddos run inside all excited and I start signing the \u201csafety form\u201d when the front desk clerk says that the form also states I give full consent to them taking pictures of my kids for any social media use. I wasn\u2019t okay with that. She replied \u201cyou don\u2019t give consent, they don\u2019t play\u201d. I was so flustered. I walked over to the small room by the front door where they have tables etc for cake. It\u2019s just a few parents in this room. I say to my mom \u201csorry \u201cthey can\u2019t play unless I sign this form and I\u2019m not comfortable with it. I\u2019m not sure what to do.\u201d  My brother says \u201cquit being fucking stupid.\u201d Im super flustered, embarrassed. I tell the clerk \u201cIm signing this form, but not consenting to you taking/posting pictures of my children\u201d. Kids go play\n\nWhile sitting and chatting with another mom, my brother comes up, starts yelling at me in front of everyone for being stupid, that if I have a problem with the party place\u2019s policy then I could \u201cget the fuck out\u201d. I didn\u2019t respond, just got up, grabbed my bag, went to get my kids. My mom, in front of everyone was like \u201cplease don\u2019t do this, just at least let the kids stay\u201d, making it sound like I was the reason I was leaving. I should take it to \u201ckeep the peace\u201d. I left, let the kids stay. I felt hurt, betrayed, attacked.\n\nWhen they dropped the kids off I was too upset to speak but they kept pushing so I explained why I was hurt but they felt like I should apologize. Asked them to leave. My dad stormed off furious. My mom tried to stop me from shutting my door. I said I was hurt, felt betrayed and wasn\u2019t apologizing. She said that I \u201cruined the tone of the party\u201d. Which is ridiculous, there were no kids near the front desk, only thing any child in that huge facility might possibly have heard was my brother yelling at me. She kept trying to circle back to \u201cwe at least get to see your kids right?\u201d It got heated and finally I had enough and told her to get off my property. I\u2019ve never used my kids against anyone. I\u2019m not that kind of person and they know that.\n\nMy brother messaged me saying it was messed up that I kicked our parents off my property. My mom messaged that I\u2019d \u201cmanaged to make the entire day into an attack against me\u201d.\n\nSo, I said I\u2019m no longer a problem for anyone in that family. Consider me dead and gone and no longer a burden or scapegoat.\n\nMy brother called my husband to get him on \u201chis side\u201d. Asked him to say that I had no right to kick anyone off our property, since it wasn\u2019t mine. My husband made it very clear that I do in fact own said property and have every right.\n\nNot our first conflict. I\u2019ve talked w/ my therapist over the years about my family. This was just too much for me this time.\n\nThey\u2019re talking talking to family painting me as who knows what. However, I can\u2019t bring myself to bother trying to set the record straight.

Not being comfortable with signing a blanket social media consent at a birthday party place.\n2. For leaving after being told to leave.\n3. For not apologizing.\n4. For cutting family off.\n\nThe reason I may be the asshole is because I don\u2019t believe I did anything wrong, but the three of them believe I should apologize.
