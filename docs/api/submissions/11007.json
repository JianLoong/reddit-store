I thought it was a late and horrible period until I was informed that the hospital I had been in for an unrelated health issue the week before had forgotten to inform me of the pregnancy (they had made a blood test and never tolde of it, I found out because my insurance wanted to know why I was first diagnosed with \"x while pregnant\" and then only \"x\", they then informed me of the positive blood test, the pregnancy wasn't mentioned in my paperwork for my gp, my gyn later confirmed what happened, had I known of the pregnancy I would have denied the treatement that while reducing my suffering was by no means life saving and most likely ended my pregnancy). It was not a planned pregnancy (though my partner and I had talked about what we would do if I became pregnant).

And a child needs more than a mom who sometimes needs assistance to walk from her bed to the bathroom) and my partner and I broke up 3 years ago because he couldn't deal with my back then much slighter disability.

It is still labor, it\u2019s still painful, and at the end I didn\u2019t get to bring my baby home to watch it grow up.\n\nApologize to them.", "Info: how did your wife apologise? Is it \u2018I\u2019m sorry if your feelings got hurt?\u2019", "YTA. The fact that you are still referring to it as \u201can innocent comment\u201d says it all. In her (W) post she admits to saying it because she felt like SIL comment stepped on her toes. That means she was being retaliatory AKA intentionally stepping on toes back \u2014 that is not innocent.", "My god - your wife is the most insensitive clod around.  She lacks tact or empathy.  Yta for supporting your wife\u2019s rude behavior and the wife is a major AH", "Imagine the wife's comment if OPs sister actually had a healthy baby, and lost it after it was born. Would it be \"I'm sorry, I know you mean we'll, but I'm not gonna take advice from someone who can't keep their baby alive\" ?\n\nI'm still fuming about her comment, only to see this AHs insensitive post.  You should absolutely have your wife's back in arguments, but when she fucked up this big, OP should be considerate of his sister's feelings too", "I think one of them was 5 months along (from reading another users comment), so that would probably be at viability and considered an actual stillbirth.\n\nI personally have had 7 pregnancy losses at various stages and one living child. My 18w loss truly felt like full blown labor and I wasn\u2019t expecting that at all. The actual birth and transitional phase were probably less painful than my full term birth because of the smaller size, I didn\u2019t tear again and didn\u2019t have to push with the same force, but everything leading up to it (the contractions) felt exactly the same. I was screaming out and writhing in agony. My epidural had worn off with my term delivery and for my 18w loss I didn\u2019t get one, just pushes of fentanyl and versed. Mine is a long story, and different situation from OP\u2019s sister, but I can relate to the physical pain of a labor around that gestation and the after effects. I feel so bad for his sister and her suffering. She\u2019s been through so much, and she has to deal with insensitive a*holes like OP and his wife on top of it.\n\nAnd you are so right that the worst part is not having a baby at the end of it. Your milk comes in fully like any birth, your hormones are jacked, and you have empty arms. It\u2019s the most traumatic experience of my life and almost a year later I am still not over it.\n\nOP\u2019s sister knows exactly what it\u2019s like to have another pregnancy and anxiety, she has way more reason experience valid anxiety than the OP\u2019s wife (who is a monster imho). She has given birth more times than OP\u2019s wife has.\n\nOP and wife show an outstanding lack of empathy and self reflection. I would never speak to either of them again.", "The wife is such an epic asshole. \n\nThe SIL went through the anxiety of thinking about labor each time she was pregnant. Also- her experience of making it 18 weeks and having a premature stillbirth be completely invalidated by your wife as \u201ca form of delivery to remove the fetus\u201d in her post earlier\u2026 is so sad. Simply because SIL hasn\u2019t shared that tragic and traumatic experience to you or your wife does not mean it should be discredited as something other than what it was. A premature stillbirth. It was labor, it was painful, and it was emotionally traumatic. That is why the BIL is probably so upset. He probably witnessed it.\n\nOP I hope your wife doesn\u2019t experience an early delivery at almost 5 months and have to be induced only for someone down the road tell her \u201cyou can\u2019t comment on this pain, you haven\u2019t given labor twice.\u201d So sad. \n\nShe is callous and incredibly heartless to think what SIL went through \u201cdoesn\u2019t count\u201d because she lost her baby. Miscarriages may be common but they shouldn\u2019t be invalidated as easy or painless on the body. Especially when she was nearly 5 months along. Wtf. \n\nYour wife is playing the victim over a hypothetical situation after she completely invalidated the SIL \u201cbecause she couldn\u2019t possibly understand how your wife was feeling anxious about her hypothetical pregnancy\u201d yet SIL is well past her second pregnancy. I\u2019m sure her anxiety was far worse after each miscarriage. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t an accidental comment. She wanted to act like her anxiety and pain was more important than someone else\u2019s and no one could understand, meanwhile completely invalidated someone who understands far more than her the pain of pregnancy and labor. Your SIL was being supportive. Your wife is dense and immature. No toes were stepped on until she decided the SILs supportive comment wasn\u2019t coddling enough.", "I\u2019m sure OP won\u2019t mention that post much. It made his wife look like an absolute monster.", "I have two living children and one miscarriage that needed a D&C. The baby passed 2.5 weeks before my surgery and on the day of surgery I was having full blown contractions that were more painful than either of my previous deliveries. Add on the trauma of it all and it is 100x worse. At least when you give birth to a living child you get a little \u201creward\u201d from it all.", "Look in this thread, the wife\u2019s original post is linked.", "Of course you want SIL to \u201cmove past it\u201d because you\u2019re probably missing her help with supporting your child. Newsflash if you can\u2019t support the one you have don\u2019t bring another kid into the mix. Also your wife is a huge asshole.", "Your wife said repugnant things.  Why are you asking to be exonerated here when you have already been told by multiple people that your wife was wrong?", "Your wife is the asshole, your family has responded appropriately. Her comment was so mean and so tone-deaf and she clearly still doesn\u2019t get it. Your sister is a saint for not allowing it to drag her down, but her husband and your father are both right to be disgusted by your wife\u2019s continued attitude. YTA.", "YTA also your wife it\u2019s the AH, she and her husband help you a lot, and the comment your wife made was extremely insensitive and cruel", "FYI, your sister has miscarried far enough along that she absolutely HAS gone through labor more than once. Your wife was wrong, and mean-spirited. She owes your sister so, so many apologies. YTA for even wondering.", "Wow. Your wife was cruel and you\u2019re just making excuses left and right. You\u2019re both behaving like assholes. Leave your sister and BIL alone, your wife has done enough damage. What assholes. YTA and especially your wife.", "I'm so sorry you went through that.", "I had a bad one as well. Im 60 and then I was 21. 5 months pregnant and knew the baby died. I had to be induced and deliver.

Do everyone a favor and stay home.", "Do you have a link to W post?", "Depends... I had the experience af a whole birth all over again hours after giving birth.", "Also, to add to your point, maybe in the pregnancy that resulted in miscarriage for the 1st time, OPs sister went through the anxiety of having to go through labour again. But after the miscarriage, every time she got pregnant, she had to go through anxiety of labour as well as the fear of losing her baby again in a miscarriage.\n\nI assume at some point the sister even wished for painful labour if that resulted in a baby that's alive and healthy.", "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmITheDevil/comments/11cfmtv/aita_for_saying_my_sil_cant_relate_going_through/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\n\nIt was posted to /amithedevil almost instantly.\n\nShe literally describes her SILs 18 week miscarriage \u201cthey had to do a form of delivery to get the fetus out\u201d yet simultaneously doesn\u2019t realize how her comment of \u201cyou haven\u2019t given labor twice\u201d is so tone deaf and hypocritical its ridiculous.\n\nShe had a induced premature stillbirth that is painful physically and emotionally and OP completely invalidates that. Very much \u201cwell no one told me so how could I know it was that bad.\u201d Vibes. Even though she did know and just invalidated it as \u201ca form of delivery.\u201d LABOR. It is LABOR.

I am just happy that Dad and BIL are protecting her as she might be too nice for her own sake.", "IKR? Imagine:\n\nSister finally lets go of the issue after a few years, as OP and his wife just kept doubling down, and didn't offer an apology. Sister comes to visit with diapers, gifts, etc, one day, and wife makes a totally \"non-hurtful\" comment, which may go as the following:\n\n \"Having 2 kids is exhausting\"\n\n Sister: \"I'm sure you'll figure it out, you're a good mother\", \n\nwife: \"How do you know, you haven't gone through having to raise 2 kids before\"", "Agreed.
