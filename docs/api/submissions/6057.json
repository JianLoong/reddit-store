He lives in a small apartment above his parents, who are the landlords. They live in the rest of the space of the house (50s). Our relationship feels like years of being emotionally in sync, genuine conversations, supporting each other at our toughest times, helping each other reach our highest goals, and naps. Lots of naps. We have something special and we just work to make it grow even more.\n\nI'm Jewish and he's Greek Christian Orthodox. We're not crazy religious, we treat the holidays like a tradition with our families, and generally respect each other's differences. This year, he and his family invited me to their christmas parties (they have second christmas). So he and I thought it would be fine if I brought my menorah to his place. He gave me the okay since it's his space, so I brought it and put it on his window sill. That was a family tradition of mine, it's how the holiday goes, and I wanted to share it with him and his family since they were sharing their tradition with me. I'm not doing anything with it. It's sitting there until I light it up after sunset, and turn it off when we go to bed. I brought some latkes to Christmas Eve dinner, they loved it! And he and I planned out the best gifts we could for all of his family members. Turns out they did the same! I never had a proper Christmas celebration with gift giving, and people genuinely enjoying each other's company. I had a lot of fun and felt loved and included.\n\nWhen I came back to my apartment from being out of town, I get a call from my bf sounding frantic and overwhelmed. His mom wanted the menorah moved from the window sill to the table. I was shocked by this comment, cause one, he lives in an apartment above his parents, and two, I felt very uncomfortable and unwelcomed just by bringing a tradition of mine to share. I deal with every small and large amount of hate as a jew every day. The least I want is a loved one creating hate and not even seeing it. \n \nIt really stings it's turned out like this, and as much as I'd like to educate her now, she's a grandma to a newly born 1st generation American, so her hands are full (they're from Croatia). I educated my bf about her comment, and told him I'm keeping my distance from her until we have the chance to speak. He is understandably dissapointed with her. He did tell her about our discussion and she simply didn't know about the tradition. But his dad got involved, and wants to have a talk to set some ground rules with us?\n\nMy bf wants to do his best to be the mediater, but him being the messenger is all he can do. I told him flat out, \"it's too late. No matter what she (now both his parents) can do to make it up to me, it's burned in my memory for the rest of my life. The only way they can make up for it is to learn from it\". \n\nSo.

How do you expect people to judge this?\n\nIn the post you merely say she asked to move it to a table, which is pretty innocuous given the context given.\n\nThen in the comments you say she was literally screaming and calling it an eyesore to the neighborhood. That's a totally different story.\n\nIs she ignorant or bigoted? You need to explain better here.", "Ok I went back and read OP\u2019s comment where her bf\u2019s mother said it was an eyesore. However it\u2019s still confusing because the menorah wouldn\u2019t even have been lit at this point after the holidays, I understand. And the mother apparently was screaming about a bunch of other issues to her son while driving. It doesn\u2019t really seem like OP, at this point, has much of any idea about what is going through bf\u2019s mother\u2019s thoughts, what her reasoning is, what other issues are coming up, why the mother is/was upset, or what the \u201cground rules\u201d to be discussed are. What we do know though, is that while OP was present at their house for a shared holiday, they made her feel loved and welcomed. Too much unknown to make any judgment at this point imo.", "That motivation wasn't mentioned in the post. The way the post is written it sounds like his mom wants it moved to a table, which would make it more front and center on display for the family. When I first read it I thought op was acting offended because the mom was treating it like a pretty decoration and not a religious item. Without reading op's comments and a lot more context it's easy to think this was a non issue.", "> This. I barely knew what a menorah is until opening this thread and to even understand what the issue is, I had to read all the comments first. So it blows my mind that this is such a big deal.\n\nIf your parents/landlords said \"Move your christmas tree out of the living room! I don't want the neighbors to see it,\" it would be pretty obvious why they wanted it moved. This feels pretty similar", "Jewish woman here. It doesn\u2019t have to be in a windowsill. You\u2019re 100% wrong here", "But if the mother presumably didn't know that, I don't quite understand why you see this as a hateful action?\n\nLike, why is this \"shocking?\" Absent any other context, it seems like a welcoming gesture?", "A menorah and a hanukkiah are two different things dude... a hanukkiah has one more candle.  \n\nGo on...\n\nEdit: but also... who fucking cares?  How about my OTHER 4 POINTS?!?!", "She said in one of her comments \u201cthat\u2019s literally not how Hanukkah is done\u201d about the table. \n\nLet\u2019s not forget that this particular menorah is symbolic, and not used for observance. She does not live with the fianc\u00e9.

Again - it\u2019s not a requirement, as OP claims", "Im fact, OP stated she isn\u2019t religious and neither is her fianc\u00e9.", "OP is not observant. Says so I\u2019m the first paragraph.", "We were literally hiding in a cave hoping the oil would last!!", "For sure, but most people know that its a super symbolically important for that religion. It seems like the reasons for asking to remove it from the window were either that they\u2019re embarrassed or themselves have religious objections against displaying other religious symbols. A mixed religious family definitely need to try and accommodate each other. \n\n\nThe weird thing is that every brand of Christianity I\u2019ve been apart adores Judaism, or there idea of it. Lots of menorahs, Israeli flags, and acknowledgement of Jewish holidays. Every Jew is lost christian in the making \ud83d\ude02 jk jk\u2026 But not really, that is a commonly held belief.", "I would.

January 7th is our Christmas, not second Christmas.", "She her other comments, the mother claimed the menorah is an eye sore as noone else in the neighbourhood had one.", "I agree with you YTA", "She was driving. Stressed about thr baby being born. Her dog going rampant. And possible road rage.", "I don\u2019t disagree. I empathize with OP, and think it\u2019s understandable to take it anti-Semitic on the BF\u2019s mom\u2019s part, but I think you\u2019re right that there\u2019s reason to extend the benefit of the doubt and get clarification.", "Except I've never heard of someone's landlord asking them to move a Christmas tree away from the window, or a painting, or a potted plant. This seems like a fairly weird request without the religious angle.", "With no further information, the first assumption I made was that she was worried about the Menorah candles catching the curtains on fire. I didn't immediately assume she was asking for it to be \\*hidden\\*, just moved.", "No it isn't obvious. Who knows why? That's why you would say \"oh, why do you want it moved?\".", "Would it really? It's not obvious to me. I promise I'm not being glib here, I'd have zero idea about why anyone would care about a christmas tree, so I'd probably ask why.
