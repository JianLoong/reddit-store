We have recently sold our house and have some money to finally go on a holiday abroad, previous holidays have been in holiday parks in the UK and it usually rains or is freezing. This will be our children's (10 and 12) first holiday abroad and the first time on a plane, so this is a big deal for us. My mum immediately started saying how she needs to be there for their first plane ride. So she wants to come with us. I told her that we wanted to have a holiday just us as a family. We haven't had a family holiday just us without parents coming too since probably 2016. My parents split up 4 years ago and since then my mum has wanted to come on all our family holidays, and one year we decided not to go on holiday and instead got a membership to a theme park chain instead, she got the same membership so we either had to sneakily do day trips as a family or take her along (of course we were happy for her to join us sometimes, but it's nice to do things at our own pace too). It's not that I never want to go on holiday with her, but I feel like this holiday will be a big adventure for us and I want it to be just us. My mum is really offended, got tearful and said I was excluding her. I know she is on her own and going on holiday by yourself isn't as fun maybe, AITA for not wanting to include her in our holiday?", "created_utc": 1697735366, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17bo566/aita_for_not_wanting_my_mum_to_come_on_our_first/", "score": 17, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would suggest you reiterate it isn't about not wanting HER specifically to come along, but about wanting this holiday to be one with just you, your spouse, and your children.  If she is still upset with that it is her own problem.", "NTA Your mother is going out of her way to insert herself into every family trip. She may be oblivious to how you want time to yourselves, just the parents and kids sometimes, and sees herself in a \"the more the merrier, I just want to join in the fun\" sort of way, but the end result is that you had to spell things out for her or take her along, as she was obviously not getting any hints.\n\nIf you haven't already you can cushion it a bit in a truthful way while still holding firm. \"Mum, as much as we love you and enjoy spending time with you, sometimes we need time just with us and the kids. Sometimes we want the experience of being just husband and wife together without any other adults present, and time to just be mum and dad with the kids. That means you can't come with us every time. Other times we all enjoy the experience of being together with you. I'm sorry if you are disappointed that you can't come every time, but I hope you understand.\"\n\nUltimately though she will just have to lump it until she gets used to it. If you don't have some time alone as a family you'll start resenting her constant intrusions more and more, and your relationship with her will suffer, so it's not like giving in avoids all trouble and leaves you all happy.", "NTA. Perfectly normal to want you're own family time. If you don't make a stand now she will keep on doing it.", "NTA. Tell her your choices and decisions and offer to take video of your kids on the plane. Maybe let her share the video on her Socials. Nana\u2019s love to brag, especially online and this will hopefully soothe her possible feelings of rejection.", "NTA- you are allowed to do things as a family without her, just like she can do things on her own or with friends.   Enjoy your trip away with your kids.", "NTA. Your mum NEEDS to see your kids sit in a seat as a plane takes off? That's unusual, to say the least.  She needs to have a life of her own, but instead wants to be in your life. You're absolutely right that your family deserves to have time for just yourselves. You're not excluding her. You're just not letting her push her way in.", "NTA and you need to finally set boundaries instead of sneaking around. You're an adult with your own family. It's reasonable that you want some trips to be immediate family only, and other trips can include your mom or others. \n\nYou have to say no. Let her feel whatever way she'll feel about it, because her feelings are not your responsibility to manage.\n\nYou're also being an AH to your partner for allowing this to go on so long, so maybe that is another way of looking at it for motivation. You owe it to your spouse and kids to allow them to have these memories and not guiltily let grandma come every time.", "NTA.  You need to set boundaries with your mom.  \"Mom, you take lots of trips without us. We need the same courtesy, the four of us need time to bond on vacation away from the daily demanding routine.  I will certainly let you know when you are invited, but no one gets invited to everything.\"  If she doesn't want to be alone, she can make friends. Traveling with groups might help her find like minded people.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Mum has to learn to wait until she's actually invited. They should have settled it back then rather than sneak off for day trips to the park."]}
