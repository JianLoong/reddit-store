He said hed be fine with getting someone to help, and asked me if i would want someone to look after the kids for me or for someone to look after the house for me. \r  \n\r  \nI wanted as much time with my kids as possible and didn't want someone else filling in the parent role so I asked him to hire someone to look after the house so he did. We went through a few different people before we found the perfect person, his younger brother. He's a sweet kid (21M) and our kids love him and I feel comfortable with him around and we don't argue like some of the other maids and housekeepers we tried.\r  \n\r  \nWhen he first moved in my husband gave him one of our guest rooms with an ensuite and that seemed to be fine until now apparently. \r  \n\r  \nOn our property there is a lovely small cottage, it's about a 20 minute walk from the main house. I've always loved this little cottage and have dreamt of living there when we give the kids the house when they are older. Well since he's been living/working here for a year my husband thought it would be a good idea to sell him the small cottage and a little bit of land around it.\r  \n\r  \nHis reasoning was that just a guest room wasn't really enough privacy and that we don't really use the cottage at all and he just wanted to sell it to his brother. And by sell he means sell for way less than its worth.\r  \n\r  \nI immediately said no, that I don't want his brother to have the cottage, how unfair he just gets to give it away to someone, especially someone who was only supposed to live here temporarily. He told me that 4 years (how long we planned to have him around) wasn't temporary (it is) and that it was his property that he was given by his grandmother before he even met me. I told him that it's unfair for him to lorde this over me and that I should get a say in what happens in our home.\r  \n\r  \nI then threatened to tell his family what he's doing (his family doesn't like his brother and would hate to know he was getting part of grandma\u2019s house) he yelled at me and called me petty and spiteful. I'm not talking to him until he apologizes and agrees not to sell the cottage. He obviously thinks I'm a TA and I don't think I am.

He\u2019s innocent in all of this!!!!!!", "Info: How about this solution.  Don't sell it don't rent it. Let him live there for free since he's doing work for you and the property is yours again when he moves out.", ">Well since he's been living/working here for a year my husband thought it would be a good idea to sell him the small cottage and a little bit of land around it.\n\nThis is a pretty common and reasonable arrangement for a full time, live-in groundskeeper/housekeeper, re a house on the property. Typically you rent it, but you also typically aren't hiring your kid brother who likely was in the line of inheritance.\n\n>And by sell he means sell for way less than its worth.\n\nI imagine you are also paying the brother far less than what the going rate for a full time, live-in housekeeper and groundskeeper is going. Family discounts go both ways. Within reason. Given that the brother is essentially hated by the rest of the family sans the husband here, there likely is more going on here than just house in exchange for service.\n\n>He told me that 4 years (how long we planned to have him around) wasn't temporary (it is) and that it was his property that he was given by his grandmother before he even met me... I then threatened to tell his family what he's doing (his family doesn't like his brother and would hate to know he was getting part of grandma\u2019s house) he yelled at me and called me petty and spiteful. I'm not talking to him until he apologizes and agrees not to sell the cottage.\n\nOk, so what is your endgame here? If you tell his family your husband and his brother will both hate you. If you get your way, your husband and his brother both hate you. You've essentially arranged the situation so that you can use his family's disregard of the brother to make him a full time servant in your house for bad pay and no benefits. I mean, you even say:\n\n>He's a sweet kid (21M) and our kids love him and I feel comfortable with him around and we don't argue like some of the other maids and housekeepers we tried.\n\nYou have a sweet fucking ride here. A great situation. And it really seems like you want to wreck all of that over greed. You all ***clearly*** make enough to buy your kids starter homes down the line, so the whole \"I want to give this to my kids\" thing doesn't really carry much water. And it's a premarital asset. Depending on where you live, you might not even have a legal standing here. I could see insisting that he rent it rather than selling, which would be a reasonable take. But the \"he should stay in a guest room for ages 21-25 while working full time in our service\" is a big fucking ask at any pay rate.\n\nHard for me to vote for anything but YTA. Normally I'm big on the whole \"two yes one no\" thing for big financial decisions, but the rest of the context here just screams out asshole. This is marriage ending stuff, right here. I hope it doesn't come to that, but this is the sort of resentment-making shenanigans that will poison things for a long, long time.\n\nYTA\n\nEDIT: Younger brother was disowned for coming out as gay as a teen. OP is using the family's bigotry to keep the younger brother as an indentured servant. What a massive asshole.", "YTA. He's saying it's his basically because ya know... its his! I hope to hell there was a prenup you seem like the type to divorce him and try taking everything.", "**YTA**  Let me count the ways:\n\n*  You had no problem with an arrangement that was all to your benefit, keeping BIL in an arrested state for 4 years while you got everything you wanted.\n* You live in *their* grandmother's home (BIL was also her grandson too no?) that was left exclusively to your husband.  In other words, morally, your BIL has more right to some consideration than you do. \n* You say the BIL has been the black sheep of the family and you are reveling in some prospective shit-stirring.\n* You are acting in an unacceptably abusive manner with this not talking, demanding an apology when you are in fact the one at fault.\n\nGrow.up.   You have a family situation that many, if not most people would love with relative taking care of the home while you get to go out and enjoy your life with your kids.   You knew it was inherited property when you moved there, what your husband does with that property is 100% his decision.   It would be better for him if you could show a bit of gratitude for your situation, since you can't do that just shut up and let him do what he thinks is right.", "INFO: Do you actually legally have any ownership over this cottage?", "Yta, for one that is your husbands house and land which he inherited. You have no say I. What he does with it. If you keep pushing him and acting like this you will probably be divorced.  And you won't have that cottage and house. to threaten your husband by calling his family who hate the brother is so wrong on some many levels. You are acting so entitled but if you keep this up you will be left with nothing.", "YTA is a pre martial asset, and YTA for threatening your husband with his family. Get over yourself before you end up homeless", "INFO: Since discussing the use of the property is so important, have you previously discussed your plans for the second house that your husband owns (to move in when you\u2019re older)? Or did you just assume that was how it would go because you were married?", "INFO: why was the brother disowned?", "Lol it\u2019s always the SAHM on this sub. You live on a property with two dwellings at least a 20 minute walk apart?  Rich people problems, my god.", "Surely renting it out to him would be the ideal situation.", "YTA you sound incredibly selfish", "YTA- He did consult you, you just don't like his decision. It's his property, which you also don't like. You never told him about your dream to live there, he sees it as unused space that could be getting used meaningfully,  but you don't like how he wants to use it so you threatened to tell people you know will blow up his phone when it's none of their business. BIL is fine to take care of your house until he's going to get something worthwhile out of it, apparently. You're lucky husband isn't just giving him the place. If I were in his shoes and my spouse acted like you, I'd be signing the deed over to brother today. \n\nYou're acting spoiled and entitled and I haven't even mentioned the silent treatment you're giving him while expecting an apology for you acting like an AH. \n\nApologize to your husband for acting like a spoiled brat and sell the place to BIL for whatever price your husband wants. \n\nYour argument that 4 years is temporary is straight up bs. That's a commitment of time and energy that equals 1/5 of BILs life up to this point, all dedicated to making your life easier. I was a SAHM to 5 kids for years. I took care of the kids, the house, and I homeschooled. Stop belittling BIL when hes taking a huge burden off your shoulders. It's a terrible look for you and I wouldn't be surprised if it has a very bad effect on your marriage for years to come, if it lasts.", "*He's making choices about our house without consulting me and ignoring my input, and holding the fact that he owns our house over my head, so AITA?*\n\nFor this alone, yes.  It isn't \"our home\".  It's his property.  Inheritance is pre-marital property.  You have no say.  Tough pill to swallow but if you had researched this earlier instead of AUTOMATICALLY thinking you have a say, we wouldn't be here.  So this whole idea of what YOU want to do with the property, at the end of the day, is irrelevant.", "YTA for nothing else than failing to use your big words with hubby to resolve this and threatening to bring his family into something which is for you and him to resolve. Not a good look.", "YTA for threatening to run to tell mommy.", "ESH sit down and have a conversation like adults. You two are just demanding things from one another which obviously is going to get you nowhere.

It was his property not mine. Not only are you demanding rights to the property but you are threatening your husband to get your way. Totally selfish and absolutely YTA!", "YTA  It's your way or the highway.", "YTA 1.) The property is your husbands. \n2.) You are getting family involved just because you know they do not approve of younger brothers, which is wrong.\n3.) It is going to be a long time before your kids are even old enough to need a house of their own.\n4.)You could always build a smaller retirement home in the future.\n5.)He was trying to discuss it, but you blew up at him\n6.)4 years is not temporary in any normal job field\nAGAIN YOU SHOULD NOT USE THE FACT THE REST OF THE FAMILY IS AGAINST YOUR BIL TO MANIPULATE THE SITUATION INTO YOUR FAVOR", "YTA for a couple of reasons, although at the beginning you had me. First, your husband is not doing anything unreasonable. He's helping his brother out, who has been helping YOU out. Second, 4 years is \"temporary,\" but it's a long time, and you've stated in comments that some of your husband's family has worked to prevent your brother-in-law from obtaining other employment. So what happens to his life and livelihood at the end of these four years? Your husband is trying to set his brother up for longer term success, which is both generous and entirely reasonable. He's also not just gifting this to his brother. You actually stand to lose nothing from this as it was a pre-marital asset and so you have no equity investment in the property. You still come out ahead. \n\nYour strategy of trying to drive a further wedge into your husband's family so that you get what you think you'll want in a couple of decades is also pretty gross. \n\nYou've noted that the house is entirely in your husband's name, so legally, it's his to do what he wants with. Perhaps a compromise you can consider is that if he sells the property to his brother under the terms he's proposing, he uses that as an opportunity to add you to the title of the remainder of the property as well, which gives you more leverage and say moving forward. Because, who knows, maybe your marriage will be as temporary as your brother-in-law's stay or your many other servants' tenures.", "YTA.\n\nFor threatening to stir up crap with his family. The poor kid has had enough done to him by these terrible people and you are willing to heap more on him because of a cottage you don't even use?", "I think YTA, it\u2019s technically your husbands inheritance for him to do what he pleases with. If your BIL is staying with you and doing the housework and maintaining the place, why not sell him the cottage.", "yta\n\nany property inherited is not matrimonial assets \n\nyour husband has final say in this its his home\n\nyour chose to be a stay at home mum fair enough but you could not cope so his younger brother took on the burden fyi\n\n4 years is a hell of a long time \n\nso suck it up you dont get a choice", "YTA - Take a step back and ask yourself - \"is this really who I am?\"  I get that you are attached to the cottage but I hope you realize how awful your post makes you sound.  Brother is sweet, has been a godsend helping you, is ostracized from his family for no good reason and you want to weaponize his own family against him.  It's not even legally yours.  I really thought \"you should talk through how you feel with your husband\" but then you brought up getting your husband's family involved and that is just plain awful.", "It's your home, but, sadly, not your property. Your husband tried to have a conversation with you and you shut him down. And four years is a very long time to still call \"temporary\", lol. I understand your frustration, but this is where some forethought would have done wonders. YTA. Sorry.", "YTA. You have no say. It is not a marital asset although I don\u2019t agree with your husband it is his right", "So, it's kinda weird sometimes to judge family issues from a post alone, but here we are so...  It seems the brother was disinherited because of a very unfair reason, him being gay. It also seems you and your husband have it good, him taking the inheritance, you being able to be a stay at home mum with additional paid help for the house. So it makes sense that your husband wants to help his brother and compensate for the unfairness done to him. If you want the cottage so much, propose some other solution or property piece it can be given to the brother. It's the right thing to do. And stop threatening to tell your in laws cause it's petty and bad. You know why they don't want the brother and you are taking advantage of their racist views...", "OP is specifically avoiding answering the question which has been asked multiple times\u2026. How much are you paying him? \nI feel like she\u2019s only giving a small amount because they are providing him room. \nHusband wants to correct the situation and she\u2019s being greedy.", "YTA, it's a premarital asset. He's discussing it with you, how is that not giving you a say in the house? What about you suggest the compromise by letting the BIL live in the cottage but not buy it?", "ESH. You\u2019ve got it both coming and going here.\n\nWhy does it have to be sell?  Why can\u2019t he just live in the cottage for the duration of the job? This way when he leaves the job he can move out.", "Your husband didn\u2019t think twice getting you help, good for him. Also, fyi four years is less \u201ctemporary\u201d and more long term. \n\nAs to your plans for the property your husband inherited. Is this something you two even discussed? Because it certainly sounds like he feels it more fair to share with a sweet caring younger brother his own  family has shunned for some reason. He\u2019s not even giving his brother the property, but selling it. \n\nUltimately this is a discussion you two need to have. YWNBTA for not wanting to sell the cottage, but you do seem a bit entitled by your behavior. \n\nLook at it this way too, depending on where you live inheritances are not community property.

Moreover, you admit that members of your husband\u2019s family have actively prevented your BIL from getting or keeping jobs because of their bigotry, which makes your threat to tell his family particularly galling. This young man has had abuse poured on him for nothing more than being born who he is, and now you\u2019re multiplying that because you want the pretty cottage in 40 years time. It isn\u2019t even your property, it\u2019s 100% owned by your husband, who is just trying to make up for some of the awfulness of his family. TBH, I think that it is a bad idea for your husband to give his brother this property excuses you and his family are such awful people the best thing he can do for his brother is help him get very far away from the lot of you.

I've always loved this little cottage and have dreamt of living there when we give the kids the house when they are older. Well since he's been living/working here for a year my husband thought it would be a good idea to sell him the small cottage and a little bit of land around it.\r  \n\r  \nHis reasoning was that just a guest room wasn't really enough privacy and that we don't really use the cottage at all and he just wanted to sell it to his brother. And by sell he means sell for way less than its worth.\r  \n\r  \nI immediately said no, that I don't want his brother to have the cottage, how unfair he just gets to give it away to someone, especially someone who was only supposed to live here temporarily. He told me that 4 years (how long we planned to have him around) wasn't temporary (it is) and that it was his property that he was given by his grandmother before he even met me. I told him that it's unfair for him to lorde this over me and that I should get a say in what happens in our home.\r  \n\r  \nI then threatened to tell his family what he's doing (his family doesn't like his brother and would hate to know he was getting part of grandma\u2019s house) he yelled at me and called me petty and spiteful. I'm not talking to him until he apologizes and agrees not to sell the cottage. He obviously thinks I'm a TA and I don't think I am. He's making choices about our house without consulting me and ignoring my input, and holding the fact that he owns our house over my head, so AITA?\r  \n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
