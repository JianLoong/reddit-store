He said hed be fine with getting someone to help, and asked me if i would want someone to look after the kids for me or for someone to look after the house for me. \r  \n\r  \nI wanted as much time with my kids as possible and didn't want someone else filling in the parent role so I asked him to hire someone to look after the house so he did. We went through a few different people before we found the perfect person, his younger brother. He's a sweet kid (21M) and our kids love him and I feel comfortable with him around and we don't argue like some of the other maids and housekeepers we tried.\r  \n\r  \nWhen he first moved in my husband gave him one of our guest rooms with an ensuite and that seemed to be fine until now apparently. \r  \n\r  \nOn our property there is a lovely small cottage, it's about a 20 minute walk from the main house. I've always loved this little cottage and have dreamt of living there when we give the kids the house when they are older.

He told me that 4 years (how long we planned to have him around) wasn't temporary (it is) and that it was his property that he was given by his grandmother before he even met me. I told him that it's unfair for him to lorde this over me and that I should get a say in what happens in our home.\r  \n\r  \nI then threatened to tell his family what he's doing (his family doesn't like his brother and would hate to know he was getting part of grandma\u2019s house) he yelled at me and called me petty and spiteful. I'm not talking to him until he apologizes and agrees not to sell the cottage. He obviously thinks I'm a TA and I don't think I am.

He\u2019s innocent in all of this!!!!!!", "Info: How about this solution.  Don't sell it don't rent it. Let him live there for free since he's doing work for you and the property is yours again when he moves out.", ">Well since he's been living/working here for a year my husband thought it would be a good idea to sell him the small cottage and a little bit of land around it.\n\nThis is a pretty common and reasonable arrangement for a full time, live-in groundskeeper/housekeeper, re a house on the property. Typically you rent it, but you also typically aren't hiring your kid brother who likely was in the line of inheritance.\n\n>And by sell he means sell for way less than its worth.\n\nI imagine you are also paying the brother far less than what the going rate for a full time, live-in housekeeper and groundskeeper is going. Family discounts go both ways. Within reason. Given that the brother is essentially hated by the rest of the family sans the husband here, there likely is more going on here than just house in exchange for service.\n\n>He told me that 4 years (how long we planned to have him around) wasn't temporary (it is) and that it was his property that he was given by his grandmother before he even met me... I then threatened to tell his family what he's doing (his family doesn't like his brother and would hate to know he was getting part of grandma\u2019s house) he yelled at me and called me petty and spiteful. I'm not talking to him until he apologizes and agrees not to sell the cottage.\n\nOk, so what is your endgame here? If you tell his family your husband and his brother will both hate you. If you get your way, your husband and his brother both hate you. You've essentially arranged the situation so that you can use his family's disregard of the brother to make him a full time servant in your house for bad pay and no benefits. I mean, you even say:\n\n>He's a sweet kid (21M) and our kids love him and I feel comfortable with him around and we don't argue like some of the other maids and housekeepers we tried.\n\nYou have a sweet fucking ride here. A great situation. And it really seems like you want to wreck all of that over greed. You all ***clearly*** make enough to buy your kids starter homes down the line, so the whole \"I want to give this to my kids\" thing doesn't really carry much water. And it's a premarital asset. Depending on where you live, you might not even have a legal standing here. I could see insisting that he rent it rather than selling, which would be a reasonable take. But the \"he should stay in a guest room for ages 21-25 while working full time in our service\" is a big fucking ask at any pay rate.\n\nHard for me to vote for anything but YTA. Normally I'm big on the whole \"two yes one no\" thing for big financial decisions, but the rest of the context here just screams out asshole. This is marriage ending stuff, right here. I hope it doesn't come to that, but this is the sort of resentment-making shenanigans that will poison things for a long, long time.\n\nYTA\n\nEDIT: Younger brother was disowned for coming out as gay as a teen. OP is using the family's bigotry to keep the younger brother as an indentured servant. What a massive asshole.", "YTA. He's saying it's his basically because ya know... its his! I hope to hell there was a prenup you seem like the type to divorce him and try taking everything.", "**YTA**  Let me count the ways:\n\n*  You had no problem with an arrangement that was all to your benefit, keeping BIL in an arrested state for 4 years while you got everything you wanted.\n* You live in *their* grandmother's home (BIL was also her grandson too no?) that was left exclusively to your husband.  In other words, morally, your BIL has more right to some consideration than you do. \n* You say the BIL has been the black sheep of the family and you are reveling in some prospective shit-stirring.\n* You are acting in an unacceptably abusive manner with this not talking, demanding an apology when you are in fact the one at fault.\n\nGrow.up.   You have a family situation that many, if not most people would love with relative taking care of the home while you get to go out and enjoy your life with your kids.   You knew it was inherited property when you moved there, what your husband does with that property is 100% his decision.   It would be better for him if you could show a bit of gratitude for your situation, since you can't do that just shut up and let him do what he thinks is right.", "INFO: Do you actually legally have any ownership over this cottage?", "Yta, for one that is your husbands house and land which he inherited. You have no say I. What he does with it. If you keep pushing him and acting like this you will probably be divorced.  And you won't have that cottage and house. to threaten your husband by calling his family who hate the brother is so wrong on some many levels. You are acting so entitled but if you keep this up you will be left with nothing.", "YTA is a pre martial asset, and YTA for threatening your husband with his family. Get over yourself before you end up homeless", "INFO: Since discussing the use of the property is so important, have you previously discussed your plans for the second house that your husband owns (to move in when you\u2019re older)? Or did you just assume that was how it would go because you were married?", "INFO: why was the brother disowned?", "Lol it\u2019s always the SAHM on this sub. You live on a property with two dwellings at least a 20 minute walk apart?  Rich people problems, my god.", "Surely renting it out to him would be the ideal situation.", "YTA you sound incredibly selfish", "YTA- He did consult you, you just don't like his decision. It's his property, which you also don't like. You never told him about your dream to live there, he sees it as unused space that could be getting used meaningfully,  but you don't like how he wants to use it so you threatened to tell people you know will blow up his phone when it's none of their business. BIL is fine to take care of your house until he's going to get something worthwhile out of it, apparently. You're lucky husband isn't just giving him the place. If I were in his shoes and my spouse acted like you, I'd be signing the deed over to brother today. \n\nYou're acting spoiled and entitled and I haven't even mentioned the silent treatment you're giving him while expecting an apology for you acting like an AH. \n\nApologize to your husband for acting like a spoiled brat and sell the place to BIL for whatever price your husband wants. \n\nYour argument that 4 years is temporary is straight up bs. That's a commitment of time and energy that equals 1/5 of BILs life up to this point, all dedicated to making your life easier. I was a SAHM to 5 kids for years. I took care of the kids, the house, and I homeschooled. Stop belittling BIL when hes taking a huge burden off your shoulders. It's a terrible look for you and I wouldn't be surprised if it has a very bad effect on your marriage for years to come, if it lasts.", "*He's making choices about our house without consulting me and ignoring my input, and holding the fact that he owns our house over my head, so AITA?*\n\nFor this alone, yes.  It isn't \"our home\".  It's his property.  Inheritance is pre-marital property.  You have no say.  Tough pill to swallow but if you had researched this earlier instead of AUTOMATICALLY thinking you have a say, we wouldn't be here.  So this whole idea of what YOU want to do with the property, at the end of the day, is irrelevant.", "YTA for nothing else than failing to use your big words with hubby to resolve this and threatening to bring his family into something which is for you and him to resolve. Not a good look.", "YTA for threatening to run to tell mommy.", "ESH sit down and have a conversation like adults. You two are just demanding things from one another which obviously is going to get you nowhere.

Totally selfish and absolutely YTA!", "YTA  It's your way or the highway.", "YTA 1.) The property is your husbands. \n2.) You are getting family involved just because you know they do not approve of younger brothers, which is wrong.\n3.)

First, your husband is not doing anything unreasonable. He's helping his brother out, who has been helping YOU out. Second, 4 years is \"temporary,\" but it's a long time, and you've stated in comments that some of your husband's family has worked to prevent your brother-in-law from obtaining other employment. So what happens to his life and livelihood at the end of these four years? Your husband is trying to set his brother up for longer term success, which is both generous and entirely reasonable. He's also not just gifting this to his brother. You actually stand to lose nothing from this as it was a pre-marital asset and so you have no equity investment in the property. You still come out ahead. \n\nYour strategy of trying to drive a further wedge into your husband's family so that you get what you think you'll want in a couple of decades is also pretty gross. \n\nYou've noted that the house is entirely in your husband's name, so legally, it's his to do what he wants with. Perhaps a compromise you can consider is that if he sells the property to his brother under the terms he's proposing, he uses that as an opportunity to add you to the title of the remainder of the property as well, which gives you more leverage and say moving forward. Because, who knows, maybe your marriage will be as temporary as your brother-in-law's stay or your many other servants' tenures.", "YTA.\n\nFor threatening to stir up crap with his family. The poor kid has had enough done to him by these terrible people and you are willing to heap more on him because of a cottage you don't even use?", "I think YTA, it\u2019s technically your husbands inheritance for him to do what he pleases with.

Brother is sweet, has been a godsend helping you, is ostracized from his family for no good reason and you want to weaponize his own family against him.  It's not even legally yours.  I really thought \"you should talk through how you feel with your husband\" but then you brought up getting your husband's family involved and that is just plain awful.", "It's your home, but, sadly, not your property. Your husband tried to have a conversation with you and you shut him down. And four years is a very long time to still call \"temporary\", lol. I understand your frustration, but this is where some forethought would have done wonders. YTA. Sorry.", "YTA. You have no say. It is not a marital asset although I don\u2019t agree with your husband it is his right", "So, it's kinda weird sometimes to judge family issues from a post alone, but here we are so...  It seems the brother was disinherited because of a very unfair reason, him being gay. It also seems you and your husband have it good, him taking the inheritance, you being able to be a stay at home mum with additional paid help for the house. So it makes sense that your husband wants to help his brother and compensate for the unfairness done to him. If you want the cottage so much, propose some other solution or property piece it can be given to the brother. It's the right thing to do. And stop threatening to tell your in laws cause it's petty and bad.

He's discussing it with you, how is that not giving you a say in the house? What about you suggest the compromise by letting the BIL live in the cottage but not buy it?", "ESH. You\u2019ve got it both coming and going here.\n\nWhy does it have to be sell?  Why can\u2019t he just live in the cottage for the duration of the job?

Also, fyi four years is less \u201ctemporary\u201d and more long term. \n\nAs to your plans for the property your husband inherited. Is this something you two even discussed? Because it certainly sounds like he feels it more fair to share with a sweet caring younger brother his own  family has shunned for some reason. He\u2019s not even giving his brother the property, but selling it. \n\nUltimately this is a discussion you two need to have. YWNBTA for not wanting to sell the cottage, but you do seem a bit entitled by your behavior. \n\nLook at it this way too, depending on where you live inheritances are not community property.

Moreover, you admit that members of your husband\u2019s family have actively prevented your BIL from getting or keeping jobs because of their bigotry, which makes your threat to tell his family particularly galling.

I've always loved this little cottage and have dreamt of living there when we give the kids the house when they are older. Well since he's been living/working here for a year my husband thought it would be a good idea to sell him the small cottage and a little bit of land around it.\r  \n\r  \nHis reasoning was that just a guest room wasn't really enough privacy and that we don't really use the cottage at all and he just wanted to sell it to his brother. And by sell he means sell for way less than its worth.\r  \n\r  \nI immediately said no, that I don't want his brother to have the cottage, how unfair he just gets to give it away to someone, especially someone who was only supposed to live here temporarily. He told me that 4 years (how long we planned to have him around) wasn't temporary (it is) and that it was his property that he was given by his grandmother before he even met me. I told him that it's unfair for him to lorde this over me and that I should get a say in what happens in our home.\r  \n\r  \nI then threatened to tell his family what he's doing (his family doesn't like his brother and would hate to know he was getting part of grandma\u2019s house) he yelled at me and called me petty and spiteful. I'm not talking to him until he apologizes and agrees not to sell the cottage. He obviously thinks I'm a TA and I don't think I am. He's making choices about our house without consulting me and ignoring my input, and holding the fact that he owns our house over my head, so AITA?\r  \n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He lives in the house.    After a year of seeing how well that worked out , and getting to know his brother better, the owner of the property decides to offer the cottage for sale.   That's a completely separate arrangement.", "But you guys are paying him to help you around the house. And if he lives in the cottage for free, that's years of him getting paid to save up for a place of his own.", "You read the part where the BIL doesn't also own the property because old bigot grandma hated him for being an affair baby and the reason he doesn't have much family is because he's gay and they are super homophobic right?\n\nThe cabin or other part of land would already belong to BIL if grandma hadn't been an AH, husband is just trying his best to make things right and OP is being greedy.", "Whoops you\u2019re right, got my wires crossed between posts.\n\nThey\u2019re getting their own money back from family for a house that they aren\u2019t planning on otherwise selling. What\u2019s the point? Why not let him live there and give him the same money you could use to buy it back? Or a raise? It\u2019s bizarre to me that selling it to him is the solution. He\u2019s family. He\u2019s 21. He\u2019s estranged and had no inheritance. What money is he buying this house with and how much is he even feasibly able to give them? I understand that gifting the land and property is a whole other process but why can\u2019t they do that if the goal is to \u201cright\u201d the wrong of his disinheritance?", "I wouldn\u2019t buy property from family if I wasn\u2019t already trying to buy a house regardless. If the house is empty, just let him live there.", "The cottage that is 1 mile away from the main house but still on their property, that she won\u2019t need to live in for another 20 years lmao.\n\nLike they can\u2019t build another cottage in that time frame if need be.", "No, it was me! You were right. I had a total reading comprehension fail.", "Yep, if they're rich enough to afford extra help (whether with the kids directly or housekeeping) I think that's actually a great thing to go for. Too many stay-at-home parents get absolutely destroyed basically \"working\" (which society often doesn't see that way) 24/7 with no breaks etc.\n\nBut OP is TA for a ton of other reasons in this story.", "Not before she did a fuckton of damage. Classic narc.", "What do your kids do? Just sit there? I'm just saying I have a 4 year old and 2 year old and if I stop to clean one area they are actively creating a monster mess in wherever I'm not cleaning. And that's just with two kids. It takes my 2 year old one second to fling a whole box of crayons all over the room and me a few minutes to clean them. And while I'm cleaning the crayons that's two minutes of mess making.... such is life with most children I'd assume. Maybe yours are different.\n\nAnd OP did say taking care of the house. It sounds like a large property that requires a whole lot of maitence not just cleaning after kida.", "I wonder how much they actually pay brother. And I am not sure where you are from but from where I am housemaids do not earn enough to save up for a place from their salary alone. Especially in a housing market rn.\n\n I also strongly suspect that salary could have \"family discount\" but it is only my assumption.\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Yes, I did. It\u2019s still titchy. Is buying that land and cottage actually a benefit to him? Healing familial wounds doesn\u2019t come with extra cash.", "You see how his wife is acting, right?", "i trained my kids like spartans. My only regret is throwing the weakest off a cliff.", "My kids did what all kids do.  In response we parented them and didn\u2019t try to offload it onto someone else.", "If the grandmother is the mother of the dads mother then it\u2019s pretty normal for BIL to get excluded as no blood relation. If it\u2019s the mother of the dad\u2019s father than it\u2019s pretty shit.", "I'm under the impression that BIL cooks for the family, does landscaping (at least mowing), plus cares for 4 kids, and cleans, while OP is a part-time mom for the fun parts only. \n\nHe's butler + nanny + property manager + maid, and he should be MAKING BANK for all that. He sounds like Superman. If I weren't a woman nearing 70, I'd propose marriage to this energetic young man. \n\nOP, YTA for the many reasons enumerated by others. And you disgust me.", "Your right, he should simply give the cottage and half the land to his brother free of charge as by rights it should be BILs anyway.", "Yeah, I didn't know how to name a profession which includes all brother's duties. Every profession you named sounds like a handful alone!", "Marry him and leave him the inheritance most of his family is denying this young man", "I mean, if that\u2019s what husband says the goal is- give BIL his inheritance- it\u2019s pretty shitty to make BIL pay for it, right?"]}
