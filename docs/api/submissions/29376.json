I also enjoy it and put lots of effort into finding and practicing recipes, especially for holiday meals. I grew up with \u201ceat to live\u201d parents who didn\u2019t know how to cook and weren\u2019t particularly interested in learning how. My mom was (is) super restrictive around food - all super \u201chealthy\u201d food, no treats. My dad didn\u2019t break her rules but stole my food off my plate or from my hands often. He couldn\u2019t (and still can\u2019t) walk by food without taking at least some of it for himself, even if there is more of the same several feet away from him. So, I developed food issues (probably not rising to the level of an eating disorder, but definitely not good habits) and have been seeing a therapist for years to better navigate food in my life. \n\nSo the current situation is that I am the cook for family gatherings. My dad (late 70sM) is a picky eater (red meat + potatoes), continues to steal food from me while I\u2019m eating and while I am cooking. My brother (mid 30s M) married my SIL (mid 30s F), a very picky eater who does not eat red meat. They have never actually given me a list of things she likes/doesn\u2019t like but have rejected many recipes in the brainstorming phase. Also, two years ago my brother, SIL and their new baby asked to crash thanksgiving 3 days before the event. I dislike Turkey so I made a pork rag\u00fa and my mom made a Turkey, which turned out dry. My brother was upset, and said he wanted things served that his wife could eat and be satisfied with, even though all the sides and one of the mains met what I know of her requirements (he just didn\u2019t want her to have dry Turkey). This last Thanksgiving, he made a separate main dish for himself and his wife and made such a big mess in the kitchen it took my mom an hour to clean before we could begin cooking the actual Thanksgiving meal. \n\nNow, my father\u2019s health and dietary needs are becoming more restrictive (diabetes and no gall bladder) and my mom puts pressure on me to meet these needs for holiday meals while also making food everyone likes. After last year, my brother suggested I no longer cook for the family, but now they have two kids under two, so neither of them are in a place to cook for the family. My dad continues in his food antics. \n\nOne of the ways I show love is through food and the effort I put in to cooking, but my family doesn\u2019t seem to appreciate it. They aren\u2019t interested in what I might enjoy making, only what everyone can/will eat, which feels like an impossible and unclear standard. It\u2019s stressful for me.

You can't be expected to provide this.\n\nOne thing is that if you are hosting and cooking the turkey  (so you should, your mom sucks at it)  **no-one** has access to your oven unless it's a side that needs to be warmed up/finished off.  Make that crystal clear.  There is absolutely no reason that your oven needs to be used for another main.

Or someone would bring a ham, he'd be happy with that - baked already - warm in a crock pot.   Mashed potatoes - make them ahead - throw them in the crock pot on warm - they will be fine.   Same thing goes for a vegetarian penne, if someone wants to bring it.    Frozen corn/peas etc can be done in the microwave.   Candied carrots can be done in the oven with the turkey or shortly after while the turkey rests.   Stuffing can be left in oven to keep warm.

We also eat up the leftovers for several days after.  Last year my Mum was hosting, but she also suddenly had my 96 year old aunt living with her.  So she cooked the Turkey and pork, and my SIL and I brought everything else.  My Dad is also diabetic so the food is chosen to be low to mid GI so he can safely enjoy it.  Your family need to act like a family and cooperate with each other.  You aren\u2019t their personal chef.\n\nYour father pinching food from your plate is weird.  It sounds like the meals provided growing up did not provide sufficient nutritious calories.", "YNTA If you opt to skip cooking, or find some other alternative.  You are not a paid chef who can make individual meals for each family member and their preferences.  It does not sound like any of these people is physically unable to make food, or even that any of them have severe or life threatening food allergies- they just prefer to demand that you go to extra great lengths to make everyone else happy.\n\nSet some serious boundaries around your cooking efforts.  Suggest eating out.  Suggest take-out.  Suggest an apps only holiday, where everyone goes home before the main meal.  Suggest a potluck.  Suggest they all do the holidays together while you stay home and have a lovely, relaxed dinner yourself, made of the things you enjoy preparing.    Suggest that they manage on their own while you go on vacation, or go eat with beloved friends (who will appreciate your efforts and reward you with endless praise and desserts).  Anything BUT slaving away and losing your joy in cooking for people who can't be bothered to appreciate it.", "Cooking for them sounds like a no-win situation.  NTA.", "NTA. Take a trip over the holidays! You deserve it!", "NTA.  We use the \"you want it, you bring it\" rule.", "NTA.... give them a head's up... \"I will be making A, B, C & D for dinner....Feel free to bring any additional food you want / need... RSVP at LEAST one week prior.\" As for your dad, ban him from the kitchen and stab his hand with a fork if he takes your food...", "NTA.\n\nYou should have stopped cooking for them a LONG time ago. What kind of parent takes food off the plate or out of the hands of their own child for themself??\n\nI also hate turkey, so I learned how to make duck two different ways. DELISH!", "YWBTA to yourself if you don\u2019t stop. People + food + family = weird control issues. Please step away and show people who appreciate your cooking the love you have.\n\nShare a list of restaurants with your family and enjoy their company instead of their nitpicking.", "NTA - if they want to continue the dinners I\u2019d suggest everyone pitch in with the cooking, but someone navigate that your Mom gets something super simple or something like a side that nobody will really care about if it\u2019s not good. SIL can make the turkey.", "NTA they don\u2019t appreciate you or your efforts.  Have Thanksgiving by yourself or with people who aren\u2019t actively rude to you.", "YWNBTA\n\nDon't cook. Make it a pot luck. Let someone else cook. Make reservations somewhere. Do anything except cook. \n\nDo you have a friend who could invite you to dinner? It's time for you to be a guest.", "NTA\n\nI think you should regroup b\n\nOne option is to make what you want, invite them and make your menu known. Tell them they are welcome to bring what they want but your kitchen won\u2019t be available since you need it. Let them choose whether or not to attend and what they bring. \n\nAnother option is dice they are picky or restricted ask both your mom and dad and your brother to bring a protein they want. \n\nOr you can make a basic menu then call and talk to your sil. Explain everything you\u2019ve been dealing with and it seems impossible to please everyone and you don\u2019t want another disaster or talk the stress and ask for her help. \n\nWhatever you choose best of luck!", "They should bring dishes they'll eat if it's a problem. I've been to family gatherings with 10+ people and usually there's like a buffet from multiple people to add onto the dishes already prepared. They need to sacrifice their time if they wanna be that picky. Literally any Thanksgiving food you can think of, it was there. Turkey, Roast Beef, Smoked Pulled Pork, even Chicken and Ham. Everyone brought what they like.\n\nThere's only so much you can do. You're not expected to meet everyone's tastes.\n\nNTA.", "Threaten to stab your dad\u2019s hand with a fork,", "NTA   The problem with having  love language that isn\u2019t the same as those around you is it is often overlooked or ignored or not even acknowledged. This can lead to major resentment. Have you told them that complaints make you not want to cook for them?  I cook every year and get thanks and compliments", "Tell your family you\u2019re buying a complete Thanksgiving dinner from a grocery store this year and they need to send x number of dollars for their share. If they complain that it\u2019s not home cooked, tell them the other option is going to a Thanksgiving buffet.", "You're dad is lucky I am not his daughter. I have actually stabbed the back of my husband's hand with my fork when he tried to take something off on my plate after I told him to stop. If all they're going to do is complain about the food you make, then I would stop making food for them. I am not a big fan of Turkey myself, and your pork ragu that you made sounds delicious. And I would happily accept that for Thanksgiving dinner!!!\n\nYWNBTA. NTA.", "Oh girl, go on vacation! Just say oh, I booked a holiday this year. Let\u2019s catch up at Christmas. You deserve a break :-)", "Tell them you booked a vacation and they\u2019re on their own", "NTA - Maybe you could suggest doing a potluck this year? Or going out to eat? I know most restaurants are closed but any restaurant in or next to a hotel will most likely be open. You can do it in a nice, non-combative way. Try saying that with everyone\u2019s unique dietary needs it\u2019s just too difficult to make meals that meet everyone\u2019s needs and you would rather spend the day with everyone you love instead of in the kitchen. Remind them that the best part about Christmas is spending quality time with your family.", "NTA!   Pass the baton along-take this year off as chef.", "NTA. Go to Cabo for a long weekend and drink margaritas. Block everyone before you get on the plane.", "I feel exhausted after reading this. No YWNBTA.", "I would have stopped cooking for these people years ago. You have more patience than I do. Also, NTA.", "NTA Just inform your family that due to everyone's health and food issues, you will no longer be cooking holiday meals. \n\nMaybe suggest you all get together and go to a restaurant where each person can order what they want to eat? \n\nOr cook for people who will appreciate it.", "NTA. Jesus Christ. This all sounds exhausting and soul crushing.", "YWNBTA. Your family does not deserve the love and care you put into your meals. But I bet your friends would.", "I agree. It seems super disrespectful to the cook. I understand that health issues should be taken into consideration but you cannot be expected to cook a different meal for every guest attending. The children will also soon have their demands.\n\nIf you are hosting the dinners, put together a menu you would enjoy cooking and eating and then send an invitation with the menu attached. And tell them if they want to eat something else they can prepare it theirselves at their home and bring it along.", ">Cook what you want, let people know they can attend or not, and eat or not, as they choose\n\nOr (assuming you can afford it) make reservations at the local buffet.", "Go to a buffet restaurant and let everybody eat or not.", "Everyone can bring their own meals and celebrate the holiday together. No fuss or harsh words.", "NTA. Your love language may be good, but it clearly isn\u2019t in your family\u2019s vocabulary to accept that gracefully. Why continue to hurt yourself.", "In our clan, the host does the main dish. Those who are coming brings an appetizer, side or salad they \u201ccan eat\u201c. That way the picky persons will have at least something they will eat. \n\nSometimes I will make a second side - depending on who is bringing what Usually Mrs Costco or Mrs Safeway makes the desserts in my house.", "Also define what potluck means:\n\nThe dish arrives ready to eat.  If it is served warm, it comes in a crock pot already warm.\nIf it's appetizers, they arrive already chopped, cut, cleaned, and with the platter/bowls for serving. Do not set out appetizers yourself if these arrive late. \n\nThe number of portions for potluck dish is stated,  so 6 portions, or whatever.", "Time for holiday potluck!  Assign people to bring their favorites.  Bring, not make in a kitchen you have to clean.\n\nNTA", "^this! My family is also full of dietary restrictions and picky eaters and this is how we approach it. We agree in advance what each family unit will bring (eg appetizer, veggie side, starchy side, main meat, dessert) and do still try to accommodate everyone or at least the majority with our dish(es) but it\u2019s not all on one person and it ensures everyone brings something that at least their family will eat.", "That is an awesome idea but I have a feeling these demanding people would be expecting OP to pay for everyone to eat out and would balk at having to contribute because I'm fairly certain they don't give any funds towards helping pay for supplies for their holiday meals, just expect to show up and be fed. People like that are awful.", "Where do you live? Thanksgiving is coming up! \ud83d\ude0b", "My brother tried that with another brother when they were 14 and 16.  The one who stole from the other guy\u2019s plate ended up with a fork in his arm.  My mom\u2019s reaction was,\u201dyou are lucky Dave didn\u2019t kill you.\u201d", "NTA OP\n\nAnd this suggestion is perfect. Grocery stores and some restaurants will even do boxes you can order that come with the fully cooked turkey, your choice of sides, rolls, and pie.\n\nMy first year I did a holiday with the in laws I offered to help in the kitchen and the overall chaos of the day meant I ended up alone (no biggie, I went to culinary school and came from a large family). The next holiday I suggested a box and offered to get the turkey or ham. It came out delicious.\n\nShe does the catered box now. It was just too much to juggle  her taking care of her ill mother, all the kiddos being toddlers, and everyone working. Now we all get tasty food and most of a day to see people. \n\nAnd you can grab extra of any favorites or have others bring their specific variety.", "I was the same - I\u2019d cook loving meals from scratch and they\u2019d refuse to eat it. My ex would also \u201cnot be in the mood\u201d\n\nSo I just went back to basics - pasta, rice dishes - it really killed my love of cooking \n\nI have a new partner who devours everything I cook him - I\u2019m rediscovering my cooking skills and now he gets catered lunches (as do I).", "No. Tell them what you are cooking,  no menu of options. If they don't like what you are cooking, they can bring a FULLY PREPARED DISH that they like. If you give them options, each side will be trying to make multiple substitutions until you are right back to the original problem.", "Oh, and NTA", "Adding on to this, go to a buffet, and everyone pays for his own meal.  You do not off to foot the bill for everyone.", "From a CHILD\u2019s plate or hands (!!) too. He did this to OP when OP was little.", "it\u2019s also not sanitary", "I grew up the same way, my father would finish all the food on his plate and then reach across the table with his fork and grab the prime bits - usually the meat - off ours. I learned to wolf the best parts as soon as they hit the plate. I still get anxiety if my husband asks for a bite of what I'm eating, or if he says he wants to share whatever I order at a restaurant. I tell him I don't want to share, and he orders his own.", "I graciously accept all offers for sides, appetizers, desserts and anything else. My oldest sibling usually brings rolls and desserts from a farm bakery near where they live and an appetizer. Another sibling brings water, soda wine and beer. It all works out.", "These days our extended family meals go down the route of a buffet/mezze where the food is all good quality deli style things but needs minimal cooking and everyone can pick at what they like.", "With the potluck invitation, specify that whatever they bring is to be shared, no veggie burgers just for them.", "That's what we do too. If I'm hosting a big dinner we do mains. Everyone else offers to bring something; sides, appetisers, dessert, salads, vegetarian main etc.", "Yes, good point! I hate when potluck attendees bring ingredients and then use my utensils, dishes, oven space to make their dish.", "I was the cook and was sick of the demands so switched to eating out. I am expected to pay for everyone. I just pay the bill because it\u2019s still easier than cooking and cleaning and I only need to spend 2 hours with everyone whereas before they\u2019d show up for bloody breakfast, have lunch and I\u2019d still be feeding them at supper time. That included supplying alcohol and driving everyone home or letting them stay over and feeding them again the next day. It\u2019s worth every penny.", "Club Cafe in Boston. The food at the thanksgiving buffet is better than their regular dinners. I strongly recommend.", "This is fair. I never cook, the audacity of demanding someone who\u2019s doing a fair amount of labor for you do it more to your standards is mind boggling.", "SO calculated to cause food issues! Clearly he had food issues of his own but man, deal with them before you start grabbing from your kid wth", "True true. Although Nobody in my clan would touch that veggie burger.  She would also know that it was a faux pas.", "You sound way too nice lol. Hopefully you at least like seeing your family. My husband was a chef and I'm just a damn good cook who does most our cooking at home so we usually get asked to cook a lot for family parties but everyone will pitch in to cover costs or bring sides and such to help even though most our get togethers are at his parents home."]}
