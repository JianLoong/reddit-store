I also enjoy it and put lots of effort into finding and practicing recipes, especially for holiday meals. I grew up with \u201ceat to live\u201d parents who didn\u2019t know how to cook and weren\u2019t particularly interested in learning how. My mom was (is) super restrictive around food - all super \u201chealthy\u201d food, no treats. My dad didn\u2019t break her rules but stole my food off my plate or from my hands often. He couldn\u2019t (and still can\u2019t) walk by food without taking at least some of it for himself, even if there is more of the same several feet away from him. So, I developed food issues (probably not rising to the level of an eating disorder, but definitely not good habits) and have been seeing a therapist for years to better navigate food in my life. \n\nSo the current situation is that I am the cook for family gatherings. My dad (late 70sM) is a picky eater (red meat + potatoes), continues to steal food from me while I\u2019m eating and while I am cooking. My brother (mid 30s M) married my SIL (mid 30s F), a very picky eater who does not eat red meat. They have never actually given me a list of things she likes/doesn\u2019t like but have rejected many recipes in the brainstorming phase. Also, two years ago my brother, SIL and their new baby asked to crash thanksgiving 3 days before the event. I dislike Turkey so I made a pork rag\u00fa and my mom made a Turkey, which turned out dry. My brother was upset, and said he wanted things served that his wife could eat and be satisfied with, even though all the sides and one of the mains met what I know of her requirements (he just didn\u2019t want her to have dry Turkey). This last Thanksgiving, he made a separate main dish for himself and his wife and made such a big mess in the kitchen it took my mom an hour to clean before we could begin cooking the actual Thanksgiving meal. \n\nNow, my father\u2019s health and dietary needs are becoming more restrictive (diabetes and no gall bladder) and my mom puts pressure on me to meet these needs for holiday meals while also making food everyone likes. After last year, my brother suggested I no longer cook for the family, but now they have two kids under two, so neither of them are in a place to cook for the family. My dad continues in his food antics. \n\nOne of the ways I show love is through food and the effort I put in to cooking, but my family doesn\u2019t seem to appreciate it. They aren\u2019t interested in what I might enjoy making, only what everyone can/will eat, which feels like an impossible and unclear standard. It\u2019s stressful for me.

Where you plan/prepare a few sides that are safe for people to consume (albeit also bland) and then tell everyone to bring something for themself to compliment it. \n\nLike, can you do steamed green beans, plain mashed potatoes, and crescent rolls. Then beyond that, everyone is told that if they want something they need to bring it themselves? \n\nI don't think you are the AH for wanting to change up the dynamic here, but given the issues you've identified, I think going straight to \"I'm not cooking at all\" is a bit of a leap since no one else in your family is likelyable to take on this task. Assuming your family dynamics are otherwise good and positive, refusing to cook at all might be interpreted as you trying to ruin an important family event.", "YWNBTA.  They sound exhausting.\n\nI have a solution for you though!  Everyone chips in and have it catered.  You can continue to cook amazing food for yourself and friends on other occasions.
