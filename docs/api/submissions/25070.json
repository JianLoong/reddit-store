Usually I don\u2019t put my opinion on her choices cause we live very different live styles but shes been asking me for advice since shes never seen any (black and orange) and obviously have never engaged in anything more than a kiss. Her fianc\u00e9e is 26 and also in the same religion as my family(not counting me). I find this relationship very odd since they are almost a decade apart in age and they dated for 2 months (when she turned 18) and have been engaged for about half a year now. As the wedding has been getting closer, shes been asking odd questions, it was pretty nonchalant questions about kissing and lingerie but now its moved up to questions about positions, techniques and how it feels. It would even be kinda okay if it was a private conversation but she asked me this at family dinners, outings, and even in front of my kids. I had to explain to her the time and place for this and she just doesn\u2019t understand the issue and her reply is always \u201c its just natural what a couple does why does it matter, your kids will do it someday.\u201d This made my blood boil. Not only was she dismissing this odd behavior in front of my kids but now bringing up their future intimacies. I kindly asked her to leave my home and when she refused I yelled at her in which she ran off crying.

OP, is it a cult?", "Odd that\u2019s she\u2019s conservative enough not to have sex until marriage but not conservative enough to think talking *explicitly* about sex in front of kids is inappropriate. \n\nNTA", "NTA. There are a thousand situations where it's okay to talk about such things, but she chose one of the worst ones - in front of the kids.", "She still a child. Should be in college growing and exploring. Should figure out a way for her to meet 5-7 people that are 30 or so whom were married at 18. Talk about eye opening material. Should get the hint that it\u2019s a massive mistake.", "Something is weird about this, and I'm not sure what it is. This may be a situation where you just have to sit back and let the damage unfold. It sounds like she's marrying the wrong guy for the wrong reasons, but there's nothing you can do about it. She'll learn the lesson, or she won't, and nothing you do will influence that.", "NTA. She most definitely is NOT ready for marriage.", "NTA. Your house, your kids and your rules. If she doesn\u2019t want to respect your wishes she\u2019s got no right to be there", "NTA. As I understand, it's not like you refused to talk about it. It's natural that she is curious about it, but she comes off very invasive. And as much as an open conversation should it be, I would never discuss it during a family dinner either, and there is also a time and place to talk about this with kids. So I probably would have done the same. But maybe this discussion should start at the \"marrying in order to have sex\" point.", "No you are not the asshole.\nShe overstepped your boundary. They are your kids, so you protect them and when she doesn't respect that, u r in the right for yelling. \n\nMy family is not rly religious, but I had some arguments with my parents too where I yelled. \nIt doesn't feel nice, but at some point it can help to make a point very clear. \nAfter a heated argument you of course need to cool down and get back to a calm discussion.", "No you are NOT .\nYour sister should respect how you raise your children", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That\u2019s completely inappropriate. \n\nBut this relationship sounds soooo concerning. You should be doing whatever you can to stop her from marrying what is very obviously a predator taking advantage of her lack of life experience. A 26 year old has no reason to be pursuing a freshly turned 18 year old. So gross.", "NTA. Your sister sounds too young to get married not because she's 18 but obviously emotionally immature. I bet she does want to get married just to have s*x. She sounds very desperate and s*x deprived having to ask those inappropriate questions around your kids. \n\nI hope your sister can find her own independence, sounds like she is too attached to how her parents feel about her. Your parents are probably strict no?", "NTA she can't force you to talk about anything that is part of your private life.", "What?", "NTA, I don't know how old your children are, but how can your sister not understand that it's not okay to talk about that in front of them? It's not like you refuse to talk about it, just in a different context !", "In a way yes, they are allowed to the leave the church at anytime. I would say its more of a brain washing. Its also very local so I cant expose the name it would give away my location", "I don\u2019t know what they are teaching In that church nowadays but they never have their rule\u2019s straight, thats why I left.", "Exactly, it would have been way different if she asked me privately but in front of my kids was too far", "Thats what Im thinking as well but I dont want to over step on her marriage and push her away any more than I already have", "Especially ones who were married to people 8+ years their senior. Like, the maturity and life experience gap when one of you is 26 and the other is just barely 18 is usually *huge*, and it's usually even more concerning if it *isn't* (since that usually means that the older partner is *massively* immature and sheltered for their age).", "Thank you!", "Yes! And of course I would never yell unless I had to. When she took that step over my boundaries to not leave my home when asked, thats when Its appropriate for me to yell.", "All you can do is lay down the rules your house and people as cult-free zones. If she wants to interact, she needs to follow normal people rules rather than the cults rules.\n\nBecause you're raising your family by normal rules. She can't respect that? She doesn't have to visit.\n\nIt seems obvious, and you'd probably know this already, but you need to lay down very clear boundaries for people who have been raised in atypical environments.  \n\nNTA", "To bring peace back into the situation, you could offer to meet up in a small Cafe or whatever to talk.\nExplain again what you felt and offer that she can ask her questions in private or via a messenger.\n\nOnly if you comfortable with that of course."]}
