Both of us work full time and our son (2y) is in daycare. I am able to work from home half the time. We share the workload of childcare around 50:50 (he's a good and involved dad, that's not the problem). He's a nurse and I'm working in an office. I earn more, so I foot more of the shared bills. I also do more chores around the house (like all the inside cleaning, I care for the dogs and cats alone, laundry, deep cleaning), his only weekly chore I won't do no matter what is mowing the lawn. We talked about the workload and about the mental load (which also is \"my\" task). It didn't change, he often would say that he does so much more than other dads.\n\nFor around half a year my husband struggles with his workload and that he can't enjoy life as he used to before our son was born. He goes to bed around 9pm and then complains that he can't even watch TV until 10pm. He fantasizes about becoming a farmer again (he was a farmer before becoming a nurse, it was hell because he had no help and it wasn't working out for him. That's why I don't understand his fantasizing about it), about quitting his current job. He often talks about his promise to himself, that if he ever would feel like right now again he would just quit and do something else. I have to remind him that he's not alone anymore and that we have to care for our son, pay our mortgage and living expenses. That we currently don't have the money to let him learn another trade. Because of the amount of times he complains it feels like it is our sons and my fault he feels like that.\n\nThis evening he complained again, loudly. I told him that I can't really help him. That I struggle, too. He has a therapist appointment for the first time on monday (waittimes are crazy here) and I told him that the therapist is better in finding a solution than I am. He jumped up, huffed loudly and told me I am an asshole for not taking him seriously and that his mental health is important. Before I could get another word in he stormed away, slammed the door and left for bed. All the while talking about cancelling the appointment because if I could not help him why should a therapist? \n\nSo, AITA for not being able to help my husband?\n\nTLDR: My husband struggles mentally and accuses me of being an asshole after I told him I am not a therapist.\n\nWhy am I asking?

A therapist is much more likely to be able to get him to see what he can do to help himself, because that is how you get out of a bad mental habit.", "NTA.\n\nYou aren\u2019t responsible for how your husband is feeling, but your life with him is probably making him feel like it is. It sounds like he is deeply unhappy with his work (super common with nurses, so much is expected of them!), and as you say, he can\u2019t leave his job because you have a mortgage, a child and bills. That he is stuck in this job that is not working for him is the cause, and since your life together is the reason he\u2019s stuck, he\u2019s inappropriately directing it at you.\n\nYou may already do this, but I wonder if approaching it with empathy would be helpful. You can be validating about how hard or bad his job is, recognize what he is doing well, and create space for him to feel understood. How you wrote this, it certainly reads as \u201cit\u2019s hard for both of us, he needs to figure it out\u201d which isn\u2019t caring.\n\nAnd I\u2019m a therapist so when I tell you that one of the first things discussed will be \u201chow do you leave your current job that is driving your depression?\u201d, you can believe me.", "NTA. You are doing more than your fair share already. You can't change reality for him. Some people can't face the responsibility and hard work of parenting. I was married to someone like this. I did 90% of everything and compromised and compromised but it wasn't enough.\n\nPlease don't have any more kids with this guy. You might find a way through with one, but more than one is likely to mean single parenthood to multiple children.", "I think this is above AITA\u2019s pay grade, so I\u2019m not gonna judge tho is TA here. Your husband sounds incredibly stressed with parental duties & his stressful job. As you said, you carry most of the mental load, and imo it\u2019s a big red flag for him to compare how much more he does than other dads - congrats, the bar is underground if you say it\u2019s a 50/50 split & he says he does more than most other dads, he needs better friends/influences in his life.\n\nHe sounds like he seriously needs therapy - he sounds like he\u2019s at the end of his rope if he\u2019s fantasizing about his past (that originally caused him so much previous distress that he left that field) & blew up at you when you said you couldn\u2019t solve him problems - sounds like he\u2019s not used to doing any mental labor for himself or others. And he may destroy what\u2019s good that\u2019s left if he doesn\u2019t get therapy soon; either that or he is discovering fatherhood is not for him.", "NAH.  He's in crisis, and sometimes people kick the ones they love the hardest when in this situation.  Getting him into therapy is the right way to go and continue to insist he see a therapist, you aren't trained in how to handle his needs.  \n\nHighly suggest you also seek out therapy if you can.", "NAH\n\n\". He fantasizes about becoming a farmer again (he was a farmer before becoming a nurse, it was hell because he had no help and it wasn't working out for him. That's why I don't understand his fantasizing about it)\"\n\nThink about this for a moment.  He's saying his current life is much, much worse than a life you found absolutely awful.  Not everyone has the same energy to deal with a stressful lifestyle.\n\nThis isn't \"AITA\" this is \"Is this guy about to completely abandon his family\".  You should really sort this out rather than try to brush it off with reddit entertainment.", "NAH - he's struggling and sounds deeply unhappy. Therapy is the best thing for him at this point. The only way you'd be an AH is if you are constantly badgering him to do more. As for him, he's depressed and overwhelmed, not an AH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don\u2019t see it as you not being supportive but you\u2019re drawing a boundary on how much responsibility you can take on solving his mental health problems.  He needs a professional, and a neutral party to share all his feelings with in a safe place.   \n\nIf you\u2019re able to hear him, be empathetic, meanwhile still holding him accountable to seeking professional help you\u2019re being a good partner with healthy boundaries.   Him wanting to skip the therapy because you won\u2019t help him seems too much like he wants to just be the victim.\n\nI also agree it sounds like he had no idea how much his life would change having a kid and responsibilities.   I totally get it.   Until my son turned 5 it was really really hard.  But, it gets better.  He needs an outlet, perhaps once a month, to just to be alone and pursue a hobby.   Same for you though.  Babysitters? Family support?  Try and seek some extra support if you can.", "[deleted]", "I got to be honest, mildly YTA. I feel like if the gender roles were reversed and it was your husband telling you \"Buck up, we need the money and can't afford for you to change careers\" while you were in crisis,  he would be getting a lot of heat.", "NAH. Husband sounds truly miserable and in crisis, but there's not much you can do beyond what you're doing. He needs more help than you can give. Tie him up if you have to, but get him to that therapy appointment no matter what.", "YTA. Sounds a lot like you really don\u2019t care.", "[deleted]", "NTA. I wonder if a physical would also help him?  \n\nI really think you did the right thing getting him to counseling. You can\u2019t fix all his complaints. They aren\u2019t all logical. His perspective isn\u2019t healthy. \n\nHe seems to think external things are going to fix what\u2019s broken inside of him but that isn\u2019t necessarily how it works. \n\nHis comments about other dads doing less is distorted. In families with two working parents both have to pitch in at home. And even if one parent stays home that job is 24/7 and so the other parent has to help. \n\nMy guess is you could add the lawn care to your list of responsibilities plus all the childcare and he still wouldn\u2019t be happy.", "NTA\n\nHonestly, this sounds abusive. I get he\u2019s in crisis, but it doesn\u2019t excuse the fact he\u2019s trying to force his wife to shoulder his misery. Then threatening to cancel the therapy appointment (especially after she mentioned the long wait time). That\u2019s the part that really gets me. \n\nShe\u2019s already doing more than him. They brought a child into this world. Have bills to pay. To threaten to cancel his long awaited therapy appointment because she can\u2019t take on any more of his misery is disgusting.\n\nIf he\u2019s really struggling to the point that he can\u2019t take it anymore, then call 911 and get him checked into an emergency psychiatric stay at the nearest hospital. \n\nIf it\u2019s not bad; he needs to stop smiting his wife. I\u2019d suggest acknowledging his wife is going through it just like him. Then expressly appreciate his wife and honor her by learning by her example.", "Yeah pretty much this :/", "How do you leave your marriage which is driving your depression?", "How is this a NAH?", "I am a person who wants to solve a problem the second it gets in my way. So I often ask him \"waht can I do to make it better?\" Because I feel like I have to help him, that it is my responsibility to \"fix\" this. I do not complain to him about the chores, never. They are a way of easing his load because he is struggling more than me. Yes, I am also a bit overwhelmed with my cup of life but we chose this together. We chose this house, this child and this marriage together and I'm trying my best to do my part of the deal. Because I truly love him and want this to work out.\n\nI already talked him into taking another position at his work in which he can choose his shifts on his own. This already helped. I am getting a raise in the near future so we also plan to reduce his weekly work hours so that he works one day a week less. And if my wage allows it, he'll take a few months saved paternity leave (we're not american). And perhaps someday I make enough money that he can take a job in farming (which pays like around 2/3 of his nursing job).", "Because we love eachother? Is a marriage free therapy for you?\n\nI just can't work through his mental struggle for him. I listen and validate his feelings a lot but I can't give him the ultimate answer he wants. And I can't work on him for him.", "My rationale is that it's a case of misunderstanding.  Wife believes she \"has it worse\" and can't understand husband's struggles.  So she's N-T-A.  Husband genuinely does probably have it worse given his thought process.  So N-T-A.\n\n=NAH  \n\n\nBeing honest I don't care much about the verdict itself, though, that's just jerry springer shit xD", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "That makes sense, thank you!", "You don't sound like you're anyone's friend tbh. If you're on the attack like this then maybe you haven't learnt an awful lot of empathy for others from being in a terrible situation, just how to tell other people how smug you are about your own relationship.  You have a lot of room for emotional growth yourself."]}
