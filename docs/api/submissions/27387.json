While it was a lot for him, he has always been a great dad, and his son is a joy and I was and still am always happy to look after him when my brother needs me too.\r  \n\r  \nNow onto what happened, my brother was supposed to have the day off so hadn't sorted any childcare but was called in last minute and couldn't really say no. he called me up and asked if I could take my nephew for the day, he was super apologetic, but I said it was fine as I didn't have any plans, my brother told me he didn't know when he would finish, and I said that little nephew could stay the night. My brother thanked me again and came by before he had to go with my nephew.\r  \n\r  \nAbout 7pm-ish my gf of 2 years knocked on my door, when I answered she was stood there dressed up and told me she had organised a surprise date, I apologised to her and told her that I was looking after my nephew, she got upset and said she had put a lot of effort into this. I told her that I appreciated the effort and would love to but I didn't know about these plans beforehand and already had commitments, and unless nephew could join us, I couldn't come.\r  \n\r  \nShe got pissed off at that and yelled that my nephew isn't my responsibility and that my brother needs to be a better parent. I told her that he was called into work last minute and was being responsible by making sure someone was looking after his son. She then went off saying how if my brother wasn't properly prepared to look after a kid he should have kept his legs shut.\r  \n\r  \nNow that set me off, she knows what happened to my brother, in fact I had told her only a few weeks ago with the permission of my brother. I told her to get off my property and that she was disgusting, and how could she say that when she knows exactly what happened.\r  \n\r  \nShe started crying and saying I was being cruel and unfair and then just started spewing some disgusting victim-blaming bullshit that I won't repeat here because it honestly makes me sick. I again told her to leave, and that I will talk to her when she has calmed down, because if we continue right now I will break up with her here and now. She got quiet, then called me an asshole and left.\r  \n\r  \nNow I kinda feel like shit for how I talked to her, not the message of what I said but maybe the content went too far, she was slightly drunk but I honestly saw red, I've always been super protective of my brother, but I also love my gf so im conflicted.

Now you know what she really thinks and that she will react like this when things don\u2019t go her way.

Definitely NTA", "In vino veritas, buddy. She didn't say it just because. And I think your reaction was fair, especially in saying you would only continue to talk after calming down. I hope you get a chance to think about this and reach a decision you're, if not happy, at least secure about.\n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nwhat she said *was* disgusting and shows you not only how she feels about your brother\u2019s experience, but about him and, by extension, you. this brand of victim-blamey rhetoric is never a slip of the tongue and *always* an indicator of even more insidious tendencies, and as we can see from the tears, she has no problem attempting to manipulate you, just to cut even deeper when she doesn\u2019t get her way.\n\nshe\u2019ll say or do something worse in the future, guaranteed. i hate that this sub is always telling people to nuke their relationships, but i think you owe it to yourself and your brother to tell her to fuck off.\n\nsorry this happened.", "NTA\n\nYour brother did the right thing and *asked* if you would watch your nephew and understood it was a last minute thing. You agreed. Your girlfriend *assumed* you were free, then essentially made demands.\n\nYou did absolutely nothing wrong.", "NTA.\n\nWow that is an extreme reaction to a failed date. If this is the type of comment that is being made so soon after learning about your brother's circumstances and over so little, I can't help but wonder what it'd be like over bigger stuff.", "Thank you for being a loving support to your brother and nephew.", "Nta .if u stay with her then u would be the asshole", "NTA - making a comment KNOWING it was SA!

It sounds like a bit of a over-reaction just for a surprise date not being able to happen because you're babysitting. She sound incredibly immature.

Your g/f completely over-reacted, and your brother is hardly a bad parent because something came up and he had to arrange last minute childcare, for goodness sake.\n\nThere's a saying \"in vino veritas\" - in wine there is truth.

She showed you who she really is - do you actually want that in your life? Because even if she doesn't say it when she's sober, it's what she believes.", "NTA.\nBut as a 52 yo woman I would advise you to let go of that relationship. I know you love her, but she isn't the right one for you. She knows how you feel about your brother and what happened to him, yet she said such ugly things about him. \n\nEven drunk, that's no excuse. \nMy mother used to say, children and drunks will tell you the truth about how they feel. I think it's true.\n\nYou deserve to be with someone who loves, respects and appreciates you and your family.", "Why the hell are you even contemplating staying with this disgusting person.", "> She then went off saying how if my brother wasn't properly prepared to look after a kid he should have kept his legs shut.  \n>  \n>She started crying and saying I was being cruel and unfair and then just started spewing some disgusting victim-blaming bullshit that I won't repeat here because it honestly makes me sick.  \n>  \n> if we continue right now I will break up with her here and now\n\nHonestly, she showed you what she thinks of your brother and the assault. Also what she thinks about rape in general. Not sure how you expect to calibrate this back to ok, were it me this would be already over and her stuff would be in a box by the curb.

Now you know what she really thinks of your family - why would you stay with her? NTA.", "NTA - once some things are said and done, unless I had some serious ties to the SO, I\u2019d end things relatively quickly. That\u2019s a pretty toxic line to cross and not understand the lashing back.", "NTA. Her true colours are all red flags. Sorry man, best to cut that toxicity out now.", "NTA and honestly, I would have broken up with her on the spot. She clearly holds these views, that rape is the victim's fault but it only comes out when she's drunk and has less of a filter. She might apologise (I doubt it), but you will now always know this is what she truly thinks.\n\nAlso, why is she mad about your not being able to go? This is what happens when you plan a surprise - people might already have plans that they cannot drop. It's entirely on her.", "NTA\n\nYour GF is very lucky that you are a far, far more tolerant person than me, but she's made it very clear what she actually thinks about not only your brother, but what happened to him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't know about you, but that would be an absolute deal breaker for me.", "NTA....\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "NTA.

She definitely does have a disgusting attitude. NTA! She is.\n\nWhile she really fucked up, I don't think it completely necessary to break everything off just yet. This might be the situation she needed to realise that she has some serious self reflection to do, and she needs to do whatever it takes to manage her strong emotions. If you feel like you can't be with her, though, that's also completely understandable.", "NTA. She showed her true colors here.  What she said about your brother\u2019s SA\u2026 something I would not be able to get past.", "NTA\n\nShe has however shown you her true self. If things don't go her way she'll throw hatred at anyone.\nIf I were you I would end the relationship.\nThere are things you can't come back from and her accusing a rape survivor of having low morals isn't something you're ever going to see eye to eye on. Even if it wasn't your brother, that's not something I could see past.\n\nIn a normal relationship she'd have expressed her disappointment, then ordered take out and had an evening in with you.", "NTA and I would break up over this. It\u2019s hard to have any respect for her when she\u2019s says such hurtful things and blames the victim.", "NTA - but you do need to break up with her.  When someone shows you who they are, believe them.", "NTA.\nWhat she did was unacceptable and cruel. That's the risk when you plan a surprise. The person you're surprising might have other obligations. She didn't get her way so she took pot shots at your brother. Frankly, I wouldn't talk to her when she's calmed down except to break it off. People may say that they don't mean the awful comments they make when they're drunk, but 9 times out of 10, what they say when they're drink is what they actually feel. If she's willing to say such horrible shit about your brother, do you really want her in your life?", "This almost reads like fiction.\n\n\nYour gf already knew about your brother's situation and despite her very extreme and outspoken views during this confrontation didn't say anything upsetting when she was told about it?\n\n\nThe contrast makes this seem unbelievable.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
