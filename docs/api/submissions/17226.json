This is mine: My sister Cassie's wedding is coming up in a couple of months. Cassie and the groom only have brothers for siblings and they each have 3 brothers, they just had the idea to ask us to be the ushers at their wedding ceremony and at the reception before dinner. This won't work for me but Cassie and her groom Harry pitched a fit when I told them.\n\nI'm working the overnight shift the night before the wedding. I'm an emergency operator at a nuclear power station. I work different shifts because the job is 24/7/365. It happens that I'm on nights the week before the wedding. We can get time off but it is scheduled far in advance. I did ask for a day off but as I expected it was a no because the notice was too short. I'm trying to find someone to take my shift the night before the wedding. I haven't yet but I'll keep trying right up until the wedding.\n\nMy plan was to have a nap after work. Then to shower; put on my suit and drive to where the wedding is. I would get there shortly before the ceremony started at the time when guests were asked to arrive. After the ceremony there is a few hours before the reception while Cassie and Harry do their photos. I was going to be in the family ones and then catch another nap before the reception. I would stay for dinner and a bit of the reception and then head home. My cousin is going with my aunt and uncle. They are leaving the reception a bit early because they are leaving on a trip that was booked before the wedding early the next day. My cousin said she would drive me and my car home and have my aunt and uncle follow behind us, because I would be too tired to drive home.\n\nIf I was an usher I would have to shower and put my suit on right after my shift ended and drive straight to the wedding. No time for a nap because I would have to start doing usher stuff as soon as I got there. I would not be able to have a nap between the ceremony and the reception because I would need to be in extra photos and I would be responsible for helping to herd the guests. I would also have to direct them before the dinner starts. Basically between work and then the wedding I would be awake for about 30 hours straight before I could leave with my cousin to go home. Plus I would be on my feet all day.\n\nI told this to Cassie and Harry. But they are mad. When they were looking for places to get married and trying to pick a date Cassie and Harry asked for copy of my work schedule because I'm the only guest who doesn't work a normal Mon-Fri job or is retired. They knew I was working the night before when they picked the date. I'm still trying to get the night off but it's not guaranteed. I can't go on no sleep to be an usher. Cassie says it will be weird if one brother is missing. There are no blood male relatives on either side under 50 or over 10 besides the brothers and I'm getting heavy pressure and requested to do it anyway.\n\n**Edited to add: They chose the wedding date at the beginning of February. The wedding is in mid July. That's 5.5 months of notice. They told me what date they picked the day after they chose it. I asked for a day off at work the same day they told me.**\n\n**They had my work schedule when they picked the date and they knew that at work we ask for time off up to a year in advance and getting time off with under 6 months of notice is basically impossible due to the nature of the job.**\n\n**They asked me to be an usher this week. 2 months before the wedding.**", "created_utc": 1684072210, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13hcrhr/wibta_if_i_wasnt_an_usher_at_my_sisters_wedding/", "score": 37, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
