I am a single mom but we are both healthy. \n\nSo for some background information: My mom(40f) and her husband(45m) didn't want any contact with for the last 3 years. I wasn't the easiest teenager and I gave my mom a really hard time. I see that now but I didn't when I was younger. For the past 3 years I tried to make up. But she made it clear she didn't want anything to do with me. Last year in October my grandfather invited me to his birthday party. I was so happy to be invited to a family event again. A few days before the party I decided to let my mom know that I was planning on attending so she wouldn't be surprised. 10 minutes after sending the message my grandma sensed me a text. Saying I was no longer invited because my mom said they would not be attending if I was there. I was pregnant at that time but nobody knew. After that my mom didn't speak to me again. \n\nSo I February I had my beautiful son. But I didn't tell my mom. She was a teen mom herself and always told me how horrible it was and how she wouldn't support us if we had kids at a young age. So this and the fact she made it clear she wanted nothing to do with me made me decide to not tell her. \n\nBut now my sister (who still lives with my mom) found out through a friend who saw me with the baby. She told my mom. My mom contacted me and called me all kind of names for not telling her and keeping her grandchild away from her. So now I am wondering: Should I have told her? And AITA?\n\nP.S.

It sounds like she did not accept your apologies, and went out of her way to avoid any contact with you. I do not know if her reasons for that are justified or not, so will not pass judgement on her for those decisions.

I personally, don\u2019t want anyone around my child who don\u2019t want me around. Granted, you were horrible lets say, but you will feel someway about it. Or she could try to take your child away due to your past so disregard\u2026 i watch too many movies", "NTA. She sounds problematic. Holding her own grandparents hostage as a >40yr old to say she wouldn't go if you went, ignores attempts to reach out then calls you names when you didn't share news with her.\n\nAll kids have issues, more issues than not are caused by massively overbearing parents than actually terrible kids. Depends on exactly what caused the issues but she sounds more like you shouldn't really get back in contact or allow her to know your kid.", "NTA. It's understandable the whole situation was rather confusing for you.  \n\nYou were really kind in letting your mom know beforehand that you'd planned on attending your grandfather's birthday. \n\nYour mom, however, was a real asshole by sending your grandma the message that if you attended the birthday your grandfather had invited you to, she wouldn't come. You mother could have regarded your message as a kind of olive branch, instead she made things worse.  Yes, you may have been a troubled teenager, but that was simply part of your growing up in what was probably not the easiest environment to grow up in.\n\nSome moms try to prevent their children from making  bad life choices by threatening not to be there for them, if they do so, but if this happens, they usually try to support their children. Your mother somehow didn't want anything to do with you any longer, and that's her loss.\n\nIt looks like your mother's preferred way of communication is blaming you in rather nasty ways. Still, if you think she just doesn't know how to deal with difficult situations, and you still  would like a relationship with her, you could choose to see her most recent reproaches as a weird way of seeking contact. \n\nSo, you could offer to have a cup of coffee somewhere out of the door, so in a real neutral environment, where she might feel she'd better keep things civil, and meet her grandchild f. Just make one hard condition: no reproaches, or you and her grandchild will be gone from her life forever.", "NTA\n\nYou don't owe a toxic abusive person (family or not) ANY relationship, especially with your child.", "NTA\n\nHave nothing to do with your mother. She made her own bed, she can lie in it.", "NTA\u2026 stay away from that person", "NTA please keep this innocent child away from your AH mother", "NTA\n\nIf she won\u2019t treat you like family she doesn\u2019t deserve to have your kid in her life either. She can treat your sister\u2019s kids or future kids as grandkids all she wants since she will actually speak to her. She\u2019s not entitled to any relationship with your kid just because of blood.", "NTA OMG NC", "NTA she cannot have it both ways.\n\nShe would have known you were pregnant but she stopped you from attending a family event. I would emphasise that she didn\u2019t want to be contacted by you so it was very hard for you to let her know.  \n\nBoundaries are important here. I don\u2019t know the reason behind her having low contact with you or the history, so she may have seen this a vengeful act. I wouldn\u2019t want a child kept from their grandparents, however if it will cause anguish for a parent that has to be considered. \n\nThe important thing here is for your son to be able to have healthy relationships with his family. You and your mother may both need to be adult and civil for his benefit", "NTA - she went no contact and removed you from her life. She doesn\u2019t get to decide when it\u2019s convenient for her bc she wants to be a grandparent. Fuck that haha \n\nDo what\u2019s best for you two. I wouldn\u2019t go back to them but that\u2019s ultimately your call.", "NTA. Just remind her of the birthday event and say something like well I know you wont ho to things I'm invited to and unfortunately for you I have a permanent invitation to my child's life. Dont worry though mom well see ya at your funeral. Then go NC again.", "NTA  \nWow your family sounds toxic even though it seems like you were a little devil to them once ahah.   \nYour mom should have clearly communicated in a healthier way than screaming at you.   \nShe can't say to you she doesn't want to hear anything from you ever again then behave her way.  \nAnd frankly, if she wants to have a bond with her grand-child, it would be easier if she made a step toward you to mend your relationship first.   \nNot rocket science.   \n\n\nI hope you all find peace as a family. However, you know better what's best for you and your child and sometimes it's by cutting ties with family.", "NTA in the slightest! Your mom cut ties with you years ago and is actively making it difficult to spend time with other people in your family.\n\nShe doesn't get a free pass to your life because you had a baby. A baby who, by your own words, your mother said she wouldn't support if you had \"at a young age\".\n\nYou, and your son, don't need her in your life. You don't want to subject your son to her abuse. You both deserve better.", "Oh my goodness. Not even a little bit TA. She didn't want anything to do with you and now she's mad she wasn't privy to your life? She can't have both. I wouldn't let her near my child. \nSuper mega ultra NTA. Mom is definitely TA.", "NTA. Do not let your child around this woman. She wants nothing to do with you STILL, she just wants access to your son.", "NTA. It is your kid, your life. They basically cut you off but want to be in YOUR kid's life? That is just insane.", "I wouldn\u2019t let her have any contact with the child until she does right by you. You\u2019ve changed your life around it sounds like, and you\u2019ve tried to make up with her. Until that relationship is repaired, and YOU are comfortable with HER behavior and trust her, then make the decision to introduce them. As a mom with grandkids, I\u2019d always leave the door open for healing and reconnection with my kids. Sometimes they go down the wrong path and have to learn the hard way. But her judging you after being a teen mom and obviously no angel herself, that\u2019s hypocritical since she knows how hard it is", "NTA. She didn\u2019t want contact, you gave her what she wanted. She doesn\u2019t get to know you, your life, her grandchild, etc\u2026 that all comes from being no contact which was her choice. \n\nCongratulations on your son! Being a mom is the hardest and most rewarding thing I have ever done!", "NTA. If they don\u2019t want to see you so much that they\u2019ll get you disinvited from a family party, they don\u2019t deserve to be part of your son\u2019s life. \nCongratulations on your new baby and best of luck with this situation", "I would be very hesitant to allow her to have a relationship with the child at all to protect the child. Definitely an opportunity to set healthy boundaries.", "You and your son are a package now, your mum needs to prove her sincerity to you before you agree access to your child.... Protect him from her.\n\nSaying that, her reaction on the phone was to berate and insult you instead of congratulate you or apologise, so maybe avoid that shit show completely and concentrate on your son and be happy instead.", "and calling you up to curse at you for respecting their boundaries and \u201ckeeping their grandkid from them\u201d? what??? did they want you to do a dead drop? you leave the infant somewhere in a public place and they pick it up after you\u2019re gone? does she listen to herself when she\u2019s speaking?? when you cut off your kid, the grandkid is none of your business. end of story. i wouldn\u2019t even entertain any requests from her until you get a heartfelt apology for this unhinged blowup. nta, whatever high ground they may have had, this incident has thoroughly squashed that.", "Op, this so much of this, especially the last paragraph.", "Bold of you to assume that she actually cares about the baby. To me, it sounds more like she cares about being grandma.", "NTA and I can\u2019t help but wonder if OP really was a \u201cbad\u201d teenager or was she trying to handle normal teenage emotions with a mom who told has said her whole life how awful it was to be a teen mom. Hearing that over and over is going to do damage to even the strongest person\u2019s mental health. \u201cYeH I got knocked up young and it\u2019s been awful and you pretty much ruined my life\u201d my dad once made a comment how he didn\u2019t know happiness until he met his now wife. My brother and I were sitting there like\u2026.ummm\u2026ok? NTA", "*Also wanted to add- I have an entire side of my family (biological father's side) who I don't speak to for many reasons. Currently pregnant with #2 and they won't be finding out until I either decide to announce publicly or have the baby.", "Yeah so many people care about the title more than the actual relationship with the kid. It\u2019s ridiculous", "Wow, that\u2019s harsh!  I hope you\u2019re not my step kid! (My husband and I both feel this way about being the happiest we\u2019ve ever been BUT we mean aside from when we became parents! Happiest we\u2019ve ever been *romantically.* but I can see him making this verbal faux pas in front of all our kids, lol)"]}
