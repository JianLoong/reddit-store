I wasn't the easiest teenager and I gave my mom a really hard time. I see that now but I didn't when I was younger. For the past 3 years I tried to make up. But she made it clear she didn't want anything to do with me. Last year in October my grandfather invited me to his birthday party. I was so happy to be invited to a family event again. A few days before the party I decided to let my mom know that I was planning on attending so she wouldn't be surprised. 10 minutes after sending the message my grandma sensed me a text. Saying I was no longer invited because my mom said they would not be attending if I was there. I was pregnant at that time but nobody knew. After that my mom didn't speak to me again. \n\nSo I February I had my beautiful son. But I didn't tell my mom. She was a teen mom herself and always told me how horrible it was and how she wouldn't support us if we had kids at a young age. So this and the fact she made it clear she wanted nothing to do with me made me decide to not tell her. \n\nBut now my sister (who still lives with my mom) found out through a friend who saw me with the baby. She told my mom. My mom contacted me and called me all kind of names for not telling her and keeping her grandchild away from her. So now I am wondering: Should I have told her? And AITA?\n\nP.S.

I was very selfish and didn't really care for the other people around me. I picked fights and made her life very hard.\nSecond I have been therapy for a few years now and live at a place that helps young single moms to get everything together. In 2 months I will move out there to my own place. Next to that I have lots of friends who will help me out.

Depends on exactly what caused the issues but she sounds more like you shouldn't really get back in contact or allow her to know your kid.", "NTA. It's understandable the whole situation was rather confusing for you.  \n\nYou were really kind in letting your mom know beforehand that you'd planned on attending your grandfather's birthday. \n\nYour mom, however, was a real asshole by sending your grandma the message that if you attended the birthday your grandfather had invited you to, she wouldn't come. You mother could have regarded your message as a kind of olive branch, instead she made things worse.  Yes, you may have been a troubled teenager, but that was simply part of your growing up in what was probably not the easiest environment to grow up in.\n\nSome moms try to prevent their children from making  bad life choices by threatening not to be there for them, if they do so, but if this happens, they usually try to support their children. Your mother somehow didn't want anything to do with you any longer, and that's her loss.\n\nIt looks like your mother's preferred way of communication is blaming you in rather nasty ways. Still, if you think she just doesn't know how to deal with difficult situations, and you still  would like a relationship with her, you could choose to see her most recent reproaches as a weird way of seeking contact. \n\nSo, you could offer to have a cup of coffee somewhere out of the door, so in a real neutral environment, where she might feel she'd better keep things civil, and meet her grandchild f.

I would emphasise that she didn\u2019t want to be contacted by you so it was very hard for you to let her know.  \n\nBoundaries are important here. I don\u2019t know the reason behind her having low contact with you or the history, so she may have seen this a vengeful act. I wouldn\u2019t want a child kept from their grandparents, however if it will cause anguish for a parent that has to be considered. \n\nThe important thing here is for your son to be able to have healthy relationships with his family.

You deserve so much better. If you are able, I wouldn't talk to any of them again. You are better than them. It doesn't matter what you did as a teenager. Your mother is a coward too afraid and selfish to even be there for her own daughter except when she wants something and, even then, she's just using it as an opportunity to further shame you.", "NTA\n\nBut I don't think she wants to be a grandma, either.  Maybe I spent too much time on writing_prompts before coming here, but my immediate thought was \"OP's mom wants to steal the kid she doesn't think OP 'deserves' so she can pretend he's her son and she can raise him 'right' and thus erase OP from all their lives\"", "Stay far away from that woman while your child is still young.

It doesn\u2019t matter if you 100% deserved it.

So basically for the past 3 years they haven\u2019t texted, called or talked to you in any way but you have been making the effort. After I\u2019m figuring out they won\u2019t talk to you, you decide to stop. Then when they find out your pregnant, it\u2019s all your fault for not telling them when it seems you have been trying to contact them and catch up on life. Your parents are terrible. They cannot think after 3 years of ignoring you and getting you UNINVITED from a party is going to earn them a relationship with their grandchild. Do not let them meet your child. They only now want to talk to you because of him, not because they love you. Does your son really need this level of toxicity in his life? If anything, if you do let them have a relationship, I think there\u2019s a good chance that they will badmouth you to him when he\u2019s older and understands more", "NTA. Your mother was the one who stated no contact, she is the one who made it very clear she didn't want to be around you. Yet, she feels like she has a right to have access to your child? There is no reality in which that makes sense. It sounds from your post like your child shouldn't be around her either. While I'm sure you had your issues, she sounds like she has many of her own. Entitlement being one. Stay strong and true to yourself. You don't owe her anything. If you decide you want her in your life, be sure to make sure she works on the relationship and earns your trust before she has any contact with your child.", "NTA and she doesn't deserve to have your son in her life the way she is treating you. actually let me correct that no one in your family deserve to have your son in their lives if they're going to let your mom control who gets to see you or talk to you by manipulating them. good luck and i hope you and your son do very well for yourselves without your toxic family in it", "NTA.

Will your Mom be a positive force in your life if you let her back in or will she be undercutting you?

I just wanted to comment that I always thought I was a horrible teen and gave my parents hell, but in retrospect I was still a child longing for validation and guidance that I never received.

Ran away from home, did drugs, slept around with much older men, etc. The mom decribed herself as her being \"a free spirit.\" \n\nBut the daughter (that I cared for) was deemed difficult and a delinquent by the mother for: having mood swings, talking back, breaking curfew, having a boyfriend, being at a party with alcohol, trying cigarettes, wearing make-up, swearing.

It seems like she grew up in a hostile environment, with a family who wasn\u2019t empathetic or very kind. That\u2019s definitely enough to make a kid act up and even if the behavior isn\u2019t that bad, it seems like it would be met with extreme overreactions. Definitely skeptical if OP was even a bad teen, like you said.", "Right. Sounds like a normal teenager and an insufferable mother.", "I have a feeling OP was a pretty typical teenager.

That was my point. OP having been a bad teenager doesn't automatically make it the mom's fault, like is being implied here.", "The mother's reaction to this situation suggests that she is a toxic individual, and is at the very least verbally abusive. \n\nAdditionally, the very first sentence says \"my mother and her husband\", and not \"my stepfather\", which could have just been a result of OP not being a native English speaker, but it could definitely lead people to think that the stepfather is not a positive figure in OP's life, and that there could have been issues there.", "Miss Piggy was a stalker TBH.

For three years.\n\nWhy would you contact her?\n\nIt tells me everything I need to know that having found out about your pregnancy she called you not to offer her support bit to berate you.\n\nIt sounds like you are aware of what you did as a teenager. And it sounds like you are working through your issues. Good luck. You will be fine. NTA", "NTA. Your mom lost the chance to hear the news when she made it clear she wanted nothing to do with you. She also doesn't get to demand access to YOUR child.", "NTA\nSend her a message saying that if she wouldn't have gotten you uninvited before she would have known.", "NTA. Willen ze geen contact? Dan krijgen ze geen contact!\n\nMom should have been careful what she wishes for :-)", "\u201cFor the past three years I tried to make up, but she made it clear she didn\u2019t want anything to do with me\u2026.Last October, I was disinvited from my grandpa\u2019s birthday party because my mom said they would not be attending if I was there.\u201d\n\nNTA.  She can\u2019t have her cake and eat it, too.  She demanded space and completely cut you from her life, despite you trying for 3 years to maintain some kind of relationship and attempting to atone for your past behavior.  Sounds like you are doing just fine on your own and have a good network of friends to support you.  If I were you, I would just keep on living my life, and let the door on my relationship with my parents stay closed.  \n\nI would block her number and completely cut off all contact.  Neither you or your baby need, or deserve, that kind of toxicity in your lives.", "NTA\n\nIf your family did not want to speak to you and even forbade you to attend Grandfather's birthday party--then THEY chose the NO contact, you merely accepted it with grace.\n\nYour mother is clearly an AH who does not deserve being in your child's presence because child doesn't need that sort of negatively(esp. as it's directed at you.)\n\nPS as written, you sound like an angsty teenager.  And lying may have been a defense mechanism.  IE you lied to keep her from YELLING at you without cause or minimal cause.", "\"First as a teenager I lied a lot to my mom. I was very selfish and didn't really care for the other people around me. I picked fights and made her life very hard. \"\n\nif that is the extent of it, NTA, and my advice is to keep on living separately and make your own family for support.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nsounds like fairly standard teenage stuff. I didn't read that you stole your mom's car and sold it, or dealt drugs and had a swat team break down your mom's doors to get to your hidden meth lab.....\n\nAnd parent have even forgiven those kinds of behavior - and most especially when the een grows up and want to renew contact.\n\nUnless there is something big and mean you did that you are not sharing, her actions are unfathomable.", "NTA, and honestly it doesn\u2019t sound like anything you did was worth being excommunicated by your mom. i\u2019d suggest continuing to keep your son away from her, for his sake. (and yours)", "NTA - your child is too young to have a relationship with his grandmother by himself. Any relationship he has with her has to involve you as well. If she bans you from seeing or speaking with her, or even attending family events, then she has no room to talk and can\u2019t be upset when you don\u2019t share big news like this with her.", "Hey, another bot replied to you;  /u/Botaleidoscop0 is a scammer!  **Do not click any links they share or reply to**.

I think she should straight up tell her that. It's not being petty telling the truth.", "    NTA your mom does not care about you she only cares about your baby\n\nNot even sure she cares about the baby. May just be using the circumstances as another arrow. Another reason to be right and daughter wrong.", "Completely agree. Also on the watching too many movies.", "If this story is true and OP is actually Dutch, that is not how it works around here. Child protection services are pretty nice around here. \n\nSome examples I had for myself; My nephew for example used drugs, stole and didn't attend school. CPS was called that. It ended up to being a single visit in which my aunt indicated she would appreciate help and they just left her with the tools/contacts to figure it out herself (my aunt is pretty smart and has a very good job). My niece on the other hand had a baby when she was 19, ended up in another relationship with a guy who would repeatedly beat her and had a similar track record with an ex. There CPS did warn her if she didn't leave him they would place the child with her parents. She left him, so CPS backed off immediately. Seriously if OP has help as she describes CPS is not going to take the baby away. Even if she hadn't had that help, they probably wouldn't take the child away. They really only do that as last thing possible.", "Luckily not all countries have a CPS like the USA. Even with claims that can be proven they usually don't take children out of the household. Taking children away is a measure that isn't taken lightly (although I do feel that it might be different for POC than for white people). Seriously, my extended family has had to deal with CPS often due to troublesome teens in our family (e.g., my sister and a nephew were very young drugs addicts). The only time they threatened to take a child away was in case of my niece, a teenage mom who had a partner who regularly beat her and who had a criminal record for beating up ex partners. They told her they would put the child in my niece's parents custody if she didn't take the child out of that situation. But as she left CPS backed off immediately.", "The edit just makes it sound like she was just... a particularly difficult teenager. But not some monster, not to the degree of being cut off by her family like that. I definitely get the vibe it's the mother's issue...", "So true. \n\nOP NTA. Getting you disinvited was very cruel of your mom. Not sure you want a relationship especially with all the things she had said.", "Agreed. It sounds like the mom majorly sucks to be that nasty towards her daughter, even if said daughter was truly that awful of a teen! Ugh!", "Edits say lied a lot, was selfish, and picked fights.\n\nI'm sitting here like \"this seems like annoying teen to me and not cut off behavior but ok...\"", "Agreed mom majorly sucks. Her edit said she lied and was selfish. Not great, but also not completely abnormal. Nothing that screams she needed to be disowned!", "Don\u2019t forget that this is OP\u2019s perspective. She didn\u2019t give any details about what she lied about or what counted as selfish. For all we know, maybe the parents had a family emergency and she refused to help out any which way or introduced the younger sister to drugs or something", "So she was a teenager? Or do you live in a world where kids are selfess and honest? Her entire family is a bunch of assholes, grandparents included. They had a chance to straighten mom out for her childish behavior and failed.", "But on the other side, she doesn't have a lot of life experience. If her mother told her she's a selfish liar, then that's what she has to go off of.\n\nThere's been so many posts here about parents parentifying their children, and then calling them selfish for not helping out the family.\n\nGiven how mature and well-adjusted OP comes across on this thread, and the fact that it's only been a few years, I'm gonna go out on a limb and assume OPs behavior wasn't the only instigator.", "Even if that were the case, that's still a teen being manipulated by an adult, and it would be the mom's responsibility to recognize it and address it/get the kid away from the other parent/sue for full custody. There is literally no excuse for disowning a teen for acting like a teen.", "I would bet that OPs mom was the difficult one. She was a young teen mom, and probably wasn\u2019t very equipped to be supportive and nurturing.", "It\u2019s possible for people to become better but that doesn\u2019t mean they were rays of sunshine before \n\nIt\u2019s also easy to come across as mature when you\u2019re writing a block of text where you\u2019re the protagonist in the story. I\u2019m not saying that OP did anything that caused her to be cut off but she hasn\u2019t provided any details about what she actually did \n\nFor example, saying \u201cI was a liar\u201d can mean many different things. You can lie about doing your homework or you can lie about being abused. In both cases you\u2019re a liar but in one of the cases it\u2019s much worse\n\nAlso she didn\u2019t say anything about what her mother did to her so on the balance of probabilities, OP was a problematic child who finally got her shit in order. But getting your shit in order doesn\u2019t undo the terrible things you did before", "That is NOT acting like a teen. Jfc. Being a teen isn't an excuse to be abusive. \n\nLet's not victim blame battered women.", "Absolutely true.", "Exactly though, it's both sides. We can't condemn OP on whatever relationship she may or may not have had with her mom, who also had her way too young.\n\nBut going NC with your own child is a BIG decision. So either OP made a HUGE fuck up that she's just not letting on about, or her mom has some issues of her own going on.\n\nSince all we have to go on is OP, and there's no way to get a different perspective, then IMO, OP appears to be the more mature one in this situation.\n\nNot to mention, she's asking if she's an AH over not telling her mother who has refused communication over the last three years that she had a baby. Not whether she's an asshole because of whatever unknown reason her mother went NC with her.\n\nGiven the timeline that OP has given, and the facts that OP has given, then IMO, OP is NTA, but her mother is.\n\nI guess you could say there wasn't enough info provided, but I disagree that more info for the question asked is needed.", "Im not disagreeing about the judgment of who\u2019s being the asshole in this situation. I\u2019m only saying that we can\u2019t come to conclusions that OP\u2019s mom was a bad mother in this situation or whether OP was just doing normal teenage crap. We don\u2019t know why she was cut off so we can\u2019t just automatically assume it was normal teenage stuff that was the problem"]}
