I wasn't the easiest teenager and I gave my mom a really hard time. I see that now but I didn't when I was younger. For the past 3 years I tried to make up. But she made it clear she didn't want anything to do with me. Last year in October my grandfather invited me to his birthday party. I was so happy to be invited to a family event again. A few days before the party I decided to let my mom know that I was planning on attending so she wouldn't be surprised. 10 minutes after sending the message my grandma sensed me a text. Saying I was no longer invited because my mom said they would not be attending if I was there. I was pregnant at that time but nobody knew. After that my mom didn't speak to me again. \n\nSo I February I had my beautiful son. But I didn't tell my mom. She was a teen mom herself and always told me how horrible it was and how she wouldn't support us if we had kids at a young age. So this and the fact she made it clear she wanted nothing to do with me made me decide to not tell her. \n\nBut now my sister (who still lives with my mom) found out through a friend who saw me with the baby. She told my mom. My mom contacted me and called me all kind of names for not telling her and keeping her grandchild away from her. So now I am wondering: Should I have told her? And AITA?\n\nP.S.

I was very selfish and didn't really care for the other people around me. I picked fights and made her life very hard.\nSecond I have been therapy for a few years now and live at a place that helps young single moms to get everything together. In 2 months I will move out there to my own place. Next to that I have lots of friends who will help me out.

Depends on exactly what caused the issues but she sounds more like you shouldn't really get back in contact or allow her to know your kid.", "NTA. It's understandable the whole situation was rather confusing for you.  \n\nYou were really kind in letting your mom know beforehand that you'd planned on attending your grandfather's birthday. \n\nYour mom, however, was a real asshole by sending your grandma the message that if you attended the birthday your grandfather had invited you to, she wouldn't come. You mother could have regarded your message as a kind of olive branch, instead she made things worse.  Yes, you may have been a troubled teenager, but that was simply part of your growing up in what was probably not the easiest environment to grow up in.\n\nSome moms try to prevent their children from making  bad life choices by threatening not to be there for them, if they do so, but if this happens, they usually try to support their children. Your mother somehow didn't want anything to do with you any longer, and that's her loss.\n\nIt looks like your mother's preferred way of communication is blaming you in rather nasty ways. Still, if you think she just doesn't know how to deal with difficult situations, and you still  would like a relationship with her, you could choose to see her most recent reproaches as a weird way of seeking contact. \n\nSo, you could offer to have a cup of coffee somewhere out of the door, so in a real neutral environment, where she might feel she'd better keep things civil, and meet her grandchild f.

I would emphasise that she didn\u2019t want to be contacted by you so it was very hard for you to let her know.  \n\nBoundaries are important here. I don\u2019t know the reason behind her having low contact with you or the history, so she may have seen this a vengeful act. I wouldn\u2019t want a child kept from their grandparents, however if it will cause anguish for a parent that has to be considered. \n\nThe important thing here is for your son to be able to have healthy relationships with his family. You and your mother may both need to be adult and civil for his benefit", "NTA - she went no contact and removed you from her life.

You deserve so much better. If you are able, I wouldn't talk to any of them again. You are better than them. It doesn't matter what you did as a teenager. Your mother is a coward too afraid and selfish to even be there for her own daughter except when she wants something and, even then, she's just using it as an opportunity to further shame you.", "NTA\n\nBut I don't think she wants to be a grandma, either.  Maybe I spent too much time on writing_prompts before coming here, but my immediate thought was \"OP's mom wants to steal the kid she doesn't think OP 'deserves' so she can pretend he's her son and she can raise him 'right' and thus erase OP from all their lives\"", "Stay far away from that woman while your child is still young.

It doesn\u2019t matter if you 100% deserved it.

So basically for the past 3 years they haven\u2019t texted, called or talked to you in any way but you have been making the effort. After I\u2019m figuring out they won\u2019t talk to you, you decide to stop. Then when they find out your pregnant, it\u2019s all your fault for not telling them when it seems you have been trying to contact them and catch up on life. Your parents are terrible. They cannot think after 3 years of ignoring you and getting you UNINVITED from a party is going to earn them a relationship with their grandchild. Do not let them meet your child. They only now want to talk to you because of him, not because they love you. Does your son really need this level of toxicity in his life? If anything, if you do let them have a relationship, I think there\u2019s a good chance that they will badmouth you to him when he\u2019s older and understands more", "NTA. Your mother was the one who stated no contact, she is the one who made it very clear she didn't want to be around you. Yet, she feels like she has a right to have access to your child? There is no reality in which that makes sense. It sounds from your post like your child shouldn't be around her either. While I'm sure you had your issues, she sounds like she has many of her own. Entitlement being one. Stay strong and true to yourself. You don't owe her anything. If you decide you want her in your life, be sure to make sure she works on the relationship and earns your trust before she has any contact with your child.", "NTA and she doesn't deserve to have your son in her life the way she is treating you. actually let me correct that no one in your family deserve to have your son in their lives if they're going to let your mom control who gets to see you or talk to you by manipulating them. good luck and i hope you and your son do very well for yourselves without your toxic family in it", "NTA.

Will your Mom be a positive force in your life if you let her back in or will she be undercutting you?

I just wanted to comment that I always thought I was a horrible teen and gave my parents hell, but in retrospect I was still a child longing for validation and guidance that I never received.

Ran away from home, did drugs, slept around with much older men, etc. The mom decribed herself as her being \"a free spirit.\" \n\nBut the daughter (that I cared for) was deemed difficult and a delinquent by the mother for: having mood swings, talking back, breaking curfew, having a boyfriend, being at a party with alcohol, trying cigarettes, wearing make-up, swearing.

A grandmother who emotionally damages your mother, who can't even be on the same property as her for a family birthday, who isolates her from the rest of her family using ultimatums like \"if she goes I won't\" is not a grandmother you need in your life. That's coming from the wife of a man whose family tried to give him a relationship with his \"grandmother\" not realising how toxic that would end up being. You can be civil as you like, kids will still pick up on undercurrents of dislike and resentment (and eventually they tend to bubble up and the kid gets dragged into it too; my husband doesn't consider her to be family and he judges her very harshly based on how she has treated his father, her son).", "100% this. Why Kermit (aka permit. Typo) someone who you don\u2019t have a relationship with\u2026.have one with your child? Especially when they have proven record of abandonment when kids do kid things? No way. I don\u2019t care what the \u201ctitle\u201d of the adult in question. No child needs a shitty grandparent just because they share DNA. \n\nAnd anyone that treats the child\u2019s mother like crap- is a crappy grandparent.", "I was going to tell you.", "No. Mom lost her right to see her child. She will try to steal the baby and turn the child against the mother.", "Dit.", "I love how the OP was literally like \u2018I was a really hard teen\u2019, but this sub is so allergic to nuance that you are just assuming that she must be wrong about that because she\u2019s the hero of this story \n\nLike, you  think that you only need a single story about OP\u2019s life to know more about it than she does? Absurd", "agree", "Als je moeder geen moeder voor je is kan ze ook geen oma zijn.", "Kermit is fantastic.", "Yeah! Why should we go around Kermiting people who don't deserve it??!", "Let her sit with the regret for a while and then when you feel healed and ready, reach out if you want to.", "She just wants to dig her claws into the precious grandbaby. Maybe even try to take it away from OP at the first chance she gets", "Bot", "She may even try to take the baby from her!", "I Agree", "Her mother is a piss poor parent who completely cut off her daughter and excluded her for years. Explain how it would be in any way beneficial to have such a person around her own child? Sometimes it is best to just cut those kind of people out of our lives.", "I think we\u2019re all just confused. Parents typically only cut their children out of their lives if they 1. Do something so awful that you can\u2019t come back from (like falsely accusing a family member with SA, threatening their lives, being physically abusive, etc) or 2. The parents are narcissistic and just want someone to blame/shouldn\u2019t have been parents in the first place. Teens can be really hard, but that\u2019s what you sign up for as a parent. There isn\u2019t much a teen could do to warrant no contact at all with the entire family it seems", "She may have been a difficult teen.  But difficult teens usually aren't born like that.   Less than ideal parenting is often a huge contributing factor.  Teens that don't have good role models often actually out.", "Kermit is! My typo, however\u2026.", "Well. Miss Piggy may have an opinion too.", "Doesn\u2019t sound like regret for treating OP such a way. If so that whole uninvited to the BD thing wouldn\u2019t have happened. She\u2019s manipulating to get access to the baby.", "It\u2019s not really that confusing, and that\u2019s a pretty narrow view? Teens can be very, very difficult, even without making false claims about sexual abuse. Parent-teen relationships can often became extremely strained and toxic. Usually this is both parties contributing to the toxicity, but it can definitely just be basically one of them, too\u2014 being a teen is really hard and so is being a parent. There a million different pressures bearing down on each party, and things can get really bad. \n\nIt\u2019s not that unusual for things to get so bad that at least one party goes no contact. Often, the teen will move out to live with a family member or close friend. These relationships usually get repaired during the 20s, as the child grows up and gains perspective, and the parent hopefully continues to emotionally mature and try to understand their child as an adult. \n\nWhat we see here is the OP having done her work to move past the difficult teen years. The mother either lacks the wisdom and maturity to complete her own growth, just kind of sucks as a person, or isn\u2019t yet ready to forgive and forget OP\u2019s teenage transgressions\u2014 do we know if OP has apologized?\n\nWe don\u2019t really know enough about any of these people to say for sure which it is. The mother\u2019s harsh words make it difficult to see her as an emotionally mature person ready to move on, but we are also only getting a very grief description of her", "It isn\u2019t easy being green."]}
