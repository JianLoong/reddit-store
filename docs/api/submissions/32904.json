Instantly, we hit it off. We bonded from the moment we met and within a few weeks, she was taking me to shop for homecoming dresses. She gave me her number and told her I could call/text any time. It was nice to finally have a female role model to discuss the things I felt I couldn\u2019t with my dad. We were close, but there are just some things you\u2019d rather talk with a woman about, ya know? When I was 18, my dad and Trish got married. I was so happy! Trish was there for all my big moments.\n\nLast year, my mom reached out. She was newly sober and wanted to make amends. I was very hesitant, but my dad and Trish told me it could bring some closure. I agreed and we talked. She apologized for everything, explaining that she fell so far deep into her addiction, she felt the best thing she could do was walk away. I didn\u2019t forgive her right away and we had several other conversations on it. Now, she\u2019s in my life but our relationship is shaky.\n\nI\u2019m getting married in 2024. I have included my mom in some of the planning, she\u2019s sitting at the family table (my dad and Trish are fine with this), but I\u2019ve honestly left her out of a lot of it. Trish has been by my side and has been of great help. She went with me and my maid of honor to pick out my dress. It was such a special moment.\n\nMy mom recently asked me when I was getting my dress and I said I already had. When she realized I took Trish, she got upset. She said she felt like Trish was doing a majority of the mother of the bride stuff. I admitted yeah, she is. My mom has helped with some stuff just us, will get ready with us day of, but I want Trish there for a lot of it. \n\nI got mad and pointed out that Trish has done all the \u201cmom things\u201d for years. She helped me dress for prom, she was the one who cheered me up when my first boyfriend cheated on me, she is the one I\u2019ve turned to for advice for a decade! While I\u2019m happy to include my mom, Trish earned these bigger moments.\n\nMy mom got weepy and said that she\u2019s apologized, made amends and that should be enough. I said I accept her apology but it doesn\u2019t erase the past. She began rambling on about how she was powerless to her addiction and would I blame her for having cancer?  I said while I understand addiction is an illness, the two aren\u2019t comparable. She can\u2019t hide behind this excuse for every little thing. Now, my mom has said she doesn\u2019t want to be a part of the wedding and will just come as a guest, as that\u2019s what I treat her as. She says I was wrong to throw her addiction in her face. \n\nMy therapist says I\u2019m within my rights to maintain these boundaries. Still, I wonder if I\u2019m being too critical here.

The step is specifically to acknowledge that your behavior harmed other people and did damage (sometimes permanent damage), reach out to those you harmed to apologize for the damage you did, and to make direct amends for that damage whenever *possible and permitted*.  It is NOT always possible to make amends for the damage you caused.  It does NOT put you back to square one as if your addiction never happened.  And the people you harmed have a right to REJECT your offer of amends if they are not open to it or if it would do more harm to them.  Making amends can be just as much about learning which relationships you have completely destroyed and need to move on from as it can be repairing those that can still be repaired or starting new relationships with people who may be open to your presence, but in a different capacity than before.  \n\nYour mom made amends, but that doesn't turn back the clock.  It doesn't undo her abandonment, and it doesn't negate the way Trish stepped up in your life.  She needs to understand that she did damage in her addiction that is going to color your relationship for a long time, possibly permanently.  She needs to understand that her absence left a hole that *someone else* stepped into, and she cannot show back up and displace them.  They are in this role now.  That she did what she did, and now she, like everyone else she harmed, needs to live with the consequences of her actions.  \n\nBut this is all work she needs to do with a therapist, her sponsor, or both.  Your therapist is right: these are fair boundaries for you to maintain, and your mother's reaction suggests she needs to do more on her side.  It's not a commentary on your boundaries being unfair.  Your mom just hasn't done all of the work.", "Trish has been there for you for ten years.

It\u2019s amazing that your mom has finally cleaned up and is making an effort to be in your life but that does not excuse her leaving you behind as well.

You are right overall though.", "NTA. \nI go to al-anon meetings, was raised by an alcoholic, and I married an alcoholic. Your mom is skewing some common phrases used in AA and al-anon. In al-anon we try to use detachment with our qualifier, to separate the person from the disease. A common phrase is to say \"would you hate your loved one for having cancer or diabetes? No, then don't hate them for having an addiction, but have healthy boundaries to maintain your own peace and sanity.\"\n\nYour mom sounds like she's rushed through all her step work, if she's done it at all, because she doesn't seem to grasp the meaning of them. \n\nYou make amends because you need to take responsibility for your actions, and to admit to yourself and another person your wrongdoings, and then make an active daily effort to stop unhealthy behaviors. The point is not seeking forgiveness. Making amends does not wipe the Slate clean, and it's against program to work the step that way.\n\nShe also seems to be completely skipping over step 10: continue to take personal inventory, and when we were wrong promptly admitted it.\n\nHer skewing the cancer/addiction comparison is her manipulating it to fit her agenda. This manipulation is 100% the behavior of an addict and \"dry drunks.\"\n\nHaving done the steps, one should also be able to accept and admit how their behaviors have affected personal relationships.

I guess it means she's using it as a blanket to cover all of her past misdeeds? But I don't think that's the key issue. The key issue is that she seems to feel that once she's made amends, then that means that you should give her full mom status in whatever way will make her feel satisfied. I expect the whole interaction looks entirely different to you. It doesn't sound like your relationship is totally repaired, and that's fine. I think trust has to be earned back slowly, and intimacy has to be built experience by experience. It doesn't make sense for you to throw your arms open and give her the \"full mom experience.\" The experience she will get is based on how you feel about her right now and how comfortable you are with including her in various wedding events. \n\nIn general, you're NTA. You're allowing her back in to a level you're comfortable with. That's where you should be. I think that's a much more important question than whether you were right or wrong to accuse her of hiding behind her addiction.", "Hi. I have been a recovering addict for 15 years now. I have 15 years of sobriety. I know exactly where your mom is, most addicts have been there. When we are sober, nwy- first few years. While we work on ourselves, we have to dog up what got us here to begin with. When we do that, we start to get angry, and then we get entitled. I felt entitled to my partners forgiveness, I felt entitled to the universe. We feel entitled to your forgiveness. I am this way because of x, so forgive me its not my fault. \n\nIt took me being through the fog or entitlement to realize I wasn't entitled to anything, especially not your forgiveness. I had to earn that. I had to prove to everyone, mostly myself, that I was worthy of even asking. \n\nYou need to sit your mom down and tell her, mom I know you couldn't control your addiction until recently. I'm proud of you, but you being sober now doesn't erase your absence from my childhood. I needed someone when you couldn't/wouldn't be here for me. I'm glad you're here now, but forgiveness is earned, not demanded. You should be thanking her for being what you couldn't be. She raised me to be who I am now, and I do see her as my mom. But that doesn't make you not my mom, too. But again, you have to earn that place in my life. You chose to leave it and I get to chose when to let you back in. Tell her to talk it over in her AA group. She should still be going to meetings by the way.", "THIS response is so well expressed that I am not even going to put my two bits in except to encourage OP to read carefully what you have said.  Thank goodness OP had Trish and continues to have Trish supporting her in this life.", "This is one of the best comments I've read in a long time. Well said and so true!", "Op needs to copy and paste this to her mom. This is so spot on", "Same, 100% agree with this sentiment. \n\nIt also strikes me the mom said \u201cthrow my addiction in my face\u201d and that\u2019s a classic projection /hypocrisy statement- she\u2019s the one who brought up her addiction card as a way to worm her way into a space she wasn\u2019t invited - then threw a hissy fit instead of respecting the OP. now blaming op as the one who\u2019s throwing it in her face, no way", "Excellent response!", "This is top notch advice. I have nothing to add but a meager upvote", "This is the way. Perfect response, nothing to add.", "Nailed it.", "Good point.  Trish has invested into her relationship with Op, whereas bio mom was elsewhere dealing with her addiction.  That's not judgment, that's simply the facts of the situation.  \n\nOp & Trish have a strong connected relationship and bio mom needs to come to grips with that reality.  To expect she can apologize and gain an instant mother/daughter relationship is unrealistic.\n\nWe have the relationships we earn with our behaviors.  \n\nNTA", "Given an inch and wanting a mile.", "Eh.  At this point, the best \"closure\" is to nip any drama in the bud.  Mom can sit this one out like all the other milestones she missed.", "Yup. Plus including Trish in these events isn't even really about bio mom, they're about who's played a role in OP's life.  OP would be well within her rights to go without bio mom even if Trish wasn't in the picture anyway. Saying sorry doesn't just erase all the hurt she's done, it just gets her back in the door. She's got to earn the closeness she wants with OP.", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying, she\u2019s causing a scene now, just imagine how she\u2019d act the day of.

The moment wouldn't have become more special by adding in OP's neglectful mother.", "Or getting a lung disease from voluntarily smoking. You chose to smoke, chose to put the cigarette in your mouth. Ditto for liver disease from drinking. The liver didn't start out that way, the booze being put through your system did that.", "\u2014We have the relationships we earn with our behaviors.\n\nThat\u2019s some poetic truth \ud83e\udd18\ud83c\udffe", "Addiction is a disease, but it happens after the CHOICE of doing drugs. You can be more prevalent to addiction due to genetics, but you still have to do drugs to become addicted to them.\n\nHonestly, in some cases, people do choose cancer (by choosing to smoke), and heart / other diseases are caused by lifestyle and health choices.\n\nAs a parent, if you decide to start doing drugs during your child's life, and leave them at 15, you don't get to play the \"addiction is a disease\" card; and if you do, then please stay away, because it's a disease I don't want to catch by being anywhere near you.", "You can't know that for sure based on someone's AITA post. She didn't ask if she WBTA if she banned her mom from coming or something. She asked if she was in the wrong for losing her cool and pointing out that Trish had been doing the mom stuff for her all these lost years and saying her mom can't hide behind the disease. I say no she is not.\n\nMom will never be able to reclaim those lost moments and will never be able to expect to. While we can weigh in with our opinions otherwise, as I've said it's on OP to decide whether she wants to maintain the line or soften her stance to let her mom in for future precious moments.\n\nWe don't know enough from this post that her mom is going to be a major AH and make a scene, or is just trying to stop missing out. I don't feel like you or I are qualified enough to say future moments are going to be worse by inviting mom to rejoin her life. OP would know best.", "Take a lot at the other answers on this thread. Very few are insisting addiction is a choice, yet they aren\u2019t absolving her of the impact of the behaviour.", "If OP had thought that her mother would make the day more special, she would have invited her.", "Everyone is allowed to have an opinion; that's the point of something like this. \n\nLife experiences lead us all down different paths, with different views. Some people believe that addiction is a disease, and therefor you can't blame the person for their actions. Some people believe that a choice led to the disease, and hold people accountable for it.", "Yeah but addiction being a disease is also s medical fact.", "Addiction is a medical fact, sure.\n\nBut can you become addicted to a drug without making the choice to do/try a drug? \n\nYes, you can genetically be more prone / likely to addiction, but without choosing to do drugs, you can't become addicted.", "Categorizing something as a disease or not is a matter of decisions, ethics, morality, all sorts of things, but not a matter of facts really.

It took years of hard work to recover the bonds I had with my kids. Years. Especially my oldest. Years of work and actually being there. Yes it\u2019s a disease like any other however you still have to go though the recovery phase and work the program if you want it to work. Part of that is understanding that not everyone is going to just forgive and forget. You\u2019re very blessed to have a good father and step mother to have been there for you when your mom was so sick.", "Nta", "NTA!  You would be foolish not to maintain these boundaries!  \nYou can forgive but that doesn't mean you can forget. Your mother missed a huge part of your life. Trish was there when you needed an adult female to turn to for support and guidance. Your mother should be grateful that you had Trish to lean on after she had abandoned you.  \nYou do you and don't be manipulated by anyone!!", "NTA. You accepted the apology. You let her back in life, you started making up for lost times. \n\nShe wants to jump straight from crawling back to being mom in every aspect. Instead of accepting that the relationship will take time to rebuild, and there are other people who you care about, and respect, she wants to play the victim because she\u2019s missing out on stuff due to her actions. \n\nShe can take what you give and slowly build back the relationship, or be selfish and entitled, and set everything further back.", "NTA. What you said was exactly, right. Your mother is still falling on her addiction as an excuse. An offered apology does not automatically come with an expectation that it must be accepted.", "Addiction is a disease in that people often have a physical disposition to being\"addict-able\"You can take two different people, force feed an addicting substance and create a physical dependence. One person can go through withdrawal and never seek it again while the other person is now at risk for acting in self damaging ways because they cannot ignore their cravings/ desire for that substance. A person can be born with that physical predisposition but if they never use an addicting substance will never be an Addict ( I had one patient who made it to her 50s--had alcoholic egg nog and then became an Alcoholic.).\n\nSo addictions are NOT directly like having Cancer ( yeah Nicotine is highly addictive and its associated with a lot cancers--my example is not perfect).

That's not where your mother's instincts fall. She's very selfish.", "She threw her addiction in your face as a child every time she used or drank or whatever the addiction was. She then chose to walk away from you. Great that she has gotten sober however it does not erase the past and all of your memories of her not being there.

At all. Good for you for setting clear boundaries. Glad you had Trish while growing up, she sounds so great. \ud83d\udc9c", "NTA.  Your mother is not finished with her recovery work if she thinks an apology can erase 11 years of abandonment.  True recovery includes accepting responsibility for her actions, not using her disease as a get-out-of-jail-free card, or to emotionally manipulate you into giving her what she thinks she deserves.

Your bio mom wants to make things about her concerning your wedding. She wants her apology and amends to be all she needs to do to step back in as your mom. If she was truly able to be happy for you, she wouldn't be getting upset about Trish helping you. \n\nFocus on you, your husband-to-be, and your wedding. Anyone who is trying to pull your focus away from those most important elements doesn't deserve your time, energy, nor tears.

And you are slowly building the relationship back. Things don't change over night. I am an addict, and it took me years for people to realize I wasn't the same anymore. NTA. I hope she stays sober, don't dwell on this. This is something she needs to be working on, not you. You aren't the one who lost the trust here.", "NTA. The thing that your mother is (quite possibly willfully) overlooking is that while she has apologized, she has *not* made amends.\n\nI don't want to talk about this in terms of scoring points - but relationships are a scale. At some points it might be weighted more heavily on one side than the other (one side giving more than the other) but eventually - they should level out. Right now your mother has an extreme deficit in what she's put into the relationship. She may have apologized. She may have even made good headway in showing through her actions that she has changed and she is committed to your relationship.\n\nHowever, this reconciliation is only a year old. That is a year's worth of rebuilding something that had been destroyed and neglected for a decade. In a year's worth of a relationship, she's not starting at the starting line and moving forward, she is having to back-fill a hole in a damaged track before she can even get moving. So - yes, she has worked hard, as you've acknowledged. She has apologized. She has put work in.\n\nBut she doesn't get to assume that a year's worth of that automatically lets her leapfrog back into the position of trusted confidant, trusted participant in these emotional, momentous occasions. A year's worth of deposits on that scale of your relationship hasn't come close to bringing it back into balance, and it's not realistic to assume that it would. You don't get to take short cuts with relationships like that.\n\nPart of it is just timing, and that's no one's fault. Maybe if you got married 5 years from now and she had 6 years of repairing the relationship you would feel differently. Maybe if she had contacted you five years ago, this conversation would be different. But you aren't, and she didn't, so this is just the reality - and you are NTA for doing these things with Trish.\n\nPS - I'm glad you have had such a wonderful, supportive, encouraging presence in your life. Trish sounds like an absolute gem. Congratulations on your wedding, and I hope that your day goes wonderfully \ud83d\udc95", "This statement is so perfect. I'm just doubling down on this.

It would have saved me years of wasted effort. Cracking jokes about your abusive behavior isn\u2019t an apology. Simply saying that you think \u201call\u201d of your kids need therapy isn\u2019t an apology. Without the acknowledgment of the damage and the consequences of that damage, no amends have been made. Just excuses and attempts to make up for it. I needed a mom when I was eight, not when I\u2019m 40.", "All of this. She's still trying to dodge responsibility for her choices and reset the clock on her shitty behavior so she doesn't have to face consequences. That's still the same addictive and abusive patterns she's always had, she hasn't changed as much as she wants OP to think. She's just replaced addiction \"recovery\" as her excuse instead of active addiction", "I\u2019m with you and am in recovery.  The mom apologized, amends is difficult for abandonment so an apology is likely the best she can do for the past but part of amends are living amends which is living as a new person who is sober and doing better to not repeat those same mistakes. Part of understanding her part of all of it is to take responsibility for what she\u2019s done and understand it may never be ok, you can hope it will get better but there\u2019s no guarantee it will.  Regardless she should understand this is entirely mom\u2019s fault and no one but her is responsible and deal with it. She\u2019s newly sober/clean so it\u2019s all new to her but she should talk to her sponsor about this and OP should tell her that as well.  It\u2019s not OP\u2019s job to make mom feel better about absolutely screwing up her life and hurting her kid and part of that is someone took over her job and did it well, that\u2019s what happens.
