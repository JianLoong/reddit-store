Church is for community, service, and fellowship. The fact that you have a \"spouse hunting group\" is beyond weird and it's the reason why you had to absorb the widow and the other two singles. Now it's the reason you are excluding this young man. Truly, do you not see how this is so divorced from church and the purpose of these groups (again, community, service, and fellowship). You're acting like high school mean girls -- \"you can't sit with us\" behavior.\n\nAlso, I can't even comment on the fact you're waiting on some 16 year olds to age into the group. Personally, I'm getting weird vibes from all of this through this post and this 22 yr old might sense that himself.", "Typical church people behavior.  YTA", "YTA - honestly the _only_ good church small group I was ever a part of was regionally based, not demographics at all. We had married, single, widowed people of all ages 20s-80s. _You_ are the one creating weird vibes by trying to enforce married and single rules (and bending those rules when it suits you). Stop being an asshole and try to show some Christian love.", "I\u2019m sorry you want the 22 year old to wait until presumably some 16 year olds turn 18 so then he has people to pursue in the singles group?? \ud83e\udd22 this is why I don\u2019t like physically going to church anymore\n\nYTA", "YTA.

You have no idea what 'energy' he's bringing or what he wants from the group.  Have you even had a conversation with him?\n\nEven if he does have that 'energy,' how does that affect any of you?  How is that a threat to you?  No one's a cheating risk, right?  And you probably know a lot of singles you might connect him with!\n\nBut more than that, YTA because it's a church group.

Here\u2019s a wild thought, maybe your exclusivity is making your church die out. I watched it happen over a 15 year time period at my (insane) church, numbers dwindled every single year, starting with the young adults. They have less than half the members now that they had 20 years ago. It\u2019s very sad to see most of the pews empty when I go back and visit, but they\u2019re also very bigoted and full of hate and judgement, so there ya go. \n\nGet with the times and become more inclusive or watch your church slowly die.

This whole situation is gross and predatory.", "If the single group is supposed to be the church version of a dating app, I imagine the 3 exception are ppl that don't want to date.

The new people joining would obviously be 18 and they'd be joining in 2 years.

Even in a small church, it's good to have some people to form a closer relationship with and have more personal time with. My church has small groups so that people have the opportunity to form friendships and do activities together throughout the week. In some cases it makes sense to have groups for specific categories. We have one for elderly people, students, teenagers and kids, because it makes sense to have a social group that fits your demographic. But also: no one is told which group to join. There's a book club one and there are several focused on Bible studies but with a lot of social stuff mixed in. Membership is fully optional and based on interests or convenience, like when and where it takes place. No one is excluded from a specific group, the demographics and if one becomes too big it will be split up depending on practical reasons. To summarize: small groups aren't anti-biblical or about separation, it's just another aspect of church life. And although I agree with your first sentence, I want to point out that there's no reason why bad applications of this would be specific to mega churches.\n\nWhat OP is describing sounds exactly like the picture you're painting though.", "Based on what it would usually be: they basically function as a smaller social group within the congregation. They could be organised by the leadership or appear organically. Sometimes they will be thematic (such as a book club), often they'll be split by age and sometimes by gender. Usually these groups meet once a week or so and have Bible studies, worship and social activities. Running a group would usually include organizing and hosting but it depends. My husband and I 'run' a small group at our church and it basically means that it takes place at our house, we update the Google calendar and we make sure there are snacks and communicate any practical information in the group chat. When it started one if us would prepare a study each time but at this point different people volunteer when they feel like doing it. There's a members who almost always come and some that come occasionally. Often people will hang out together for dinners or activities. Since this is an international church in a university city there's a lot of turnover so these things are a pretty important part of finding friends in a new city for a lot of people. Leadership supports people starting and running groups independently and wouldn't interfere unless problems arise. \n\nIt sounds like in OP's church the groups are a lot more rigid and top-down.", "It might be crass to make the widow join the singles club, and the other two are LGBT+ and don't date within the church. So if it really is a club to find a spouse, the new guy is gonna luck out either way.", "Organized religions are culty af.. 18-30 for the young married couples. \n\nIm curious how many of those 18 year olds ended up married to someone who was 18 when they were 12 and taught at their youth group, vacation bible camp or summer conversion camp.. especially considering the nonchalante attitude of having a 25 year old scouting 18 year olds in a singles group.. lol wtf", "It's a church.
