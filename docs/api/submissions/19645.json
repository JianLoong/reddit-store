Their oldest son is 22 years old and unmarried. At our church, we try to make sure that there's a small group option for every member. Our Single Young Adults group would be a good fit for him, but we have a tiny gap where there aren't really any single 18-30 year olds right now, so the group would have one person: him.

As I said above, there's about to be a huge influx of new young adults, so if the two groups are combined, I'm going to end up responsible for all of it. I don't want to run a dating group and open myself up to everyone's opinions (as the Singles group is the most stigmatized). I never would have taken this position if it involved that and while I feel bad for this guy, I want to keep the groups separate far more.\n\nI'm still saying no, but there's a lot of infighting about this.

We have one for elderly people, students, teenagers and kids, because it makes sense to have a social group that fits your demographic. But also: no one is told which group to join. There's a book club one and there are several focused on Bible studies but with a lot of social stuff mixed in. Membership is fully optional and based on interests or convenience, like when and where it takes place. No one is excluded from a specific group, the demographics and if one becomes too big it will be split up depending on practical reasons.

My husband and I 'run' a small group at our church and it basically means that it takes place at our house, we update the Google calendar and we make sure there are snacks and communicate any practical information in the group chat. When it started one if us would prepare a study each time but at this point different people volunteer when they feel like doing it.

Firstly, if you're actually assigning groups om the basis of 'interested in dating within the group' and 'not interested in looking for a partner here' it needs to be clear that those are the criteria, not marital status. Secondly, it's not helpful for people who may want to date to automatically put them in a group where that's the main focus, and it's not helpful for singles who will not be dating group members that they can't be part of a social group with other singles. That sounds like it's going to contribute to an unhealthy and frankly, theologically problematic culture around singleness and relationships.\n\nIf the situation is that young people are only joining to date and that's causing problems for the overall culture of the group, address that. Welcome whoever wants to be there but get some solid leadership for the group and formulate a serious vision for the group. If people who mainly come for the dating still want to be a part of it, great. But it also needs to be a good place for people who are not there for the dating scene, otherwise there's no point of having a group instead of organising a speeddating event now and then and calling it a day. And if church is the only place to meet suitable partners, people who want that should also be able to meet people outside of the group. If small groups fully determine the lines between all social contacts within the church that's a problem.\n\nHaving a married group is fine, not if it's leading to a social division between married and unmarried people. It's important to make contacts in different circles, that's a pretty important part of being a church. Also, Christianity has a weird thing about marital status determining how mature/spiritual/'in'/etc. people are considered and that's not biblical. Its far better to minimize the rift between the married and single group, especially to include older singles.\n\nAs I mentioned in another comment, my husband and I also host a small group. However, the atmosphere there is very different because anyone can choose whether to join a group and which. It has really positive effects. Because its not forced, groups tend to have a positive dynamic, newcomers are easily welcomed, and you form relationships with a variety of people. It's also am  excellent safeguard against groups turning into cliques. \n\nSomeone else has already pointed this out but in this case you'd also be making a 24 year old having a social group of 18 year olds. If there are enough people with a good variety of ages between 18-30 that's a perfectly fine age group to combine, but this way doesn't make sense. You're also now telling a 22-year old that based on his relationship status, he belongs to category of people who are now 16 instead of to the adults. Not a great message if the church is supposed to be valuing singleness as much as marriage.\n\nI want to believe that everyone here has good intentions. I hope this is constructive and that you'll be able to create a better situation. I think you've got a lot of opportunities here if you're willing to give up some control and try out some new things.", "In that case it would be fair that only couples would be included in your group, as you said there's also 3 single people in it, I consider it unfair you left out this young man.", "YTA but you\u2019re definitely doing him a huge favor by driving him away from the church.

They're included despite openly being LGBT and dating, that's pretty progressive for most churches.\n\nThe weird thing is not so much the attitude towards the LGBT members, but the fact that the division is not 'unmarried/single people' and 'settled down people' but 'people who don't need to find a partner within the small group' and 'people who will be using the small group to look for a partner'. That seems like a bigger issue though and not really OP's fault.\n\nSounds like OP, and probably some other people need to start being more flexible, but mostly that some systematic changes are needed in the way that singleness is viewed in the church. It's true that in practice youth groups etc. are used a lot for dating, but splitting people up beforehand depending on whether they're searching for a partner or not wanting to date isn't helpful for either category.", "I don't want the responsibility.", "Q: Why do mathematicians consider the set with one element a group?\n\nA: So they can say that they belong to a group of friends.", "I'm mostly curious at this point.

It is assumed by OP and the leadership that allowed them to join that they can't/won't find a relationship within the church.

Tolerating LGBT people only if they swear off gay sex or act like they have is a not uncommon tack for repressive churches to take.\n\nETA: For the record, I don't know whether the OP or their church is homophobic, though I don't have a great feeling about it for at least the church. I'm just answering the question about why they *sound* homophobic.", "A) The fact that OP is comfortable describing the widow as a widow, but euphemizes the LGBT people in their group as \"people with special circumstances\" is a red flag for discomfort with LGBT identity.\n\nB) The LGBT people only date outside the church. Why? There's no chance of any other LGBT people ever joining the church or the group? Why is that? Another red flag for homophobia.\n\nC) OP's description (\"the LGBT\") implies a lack of familiarity with mainstream language used to describe LGBT people. No one says \"the blacks\" anymore (at least, no one who isn't a racist) and no one really says \"the LGBT\" either.\n\nD) I have been part of similar churches as a queer person in the past, and have personally experienced the type of homophobia couched in the \"we don't agree with your lifestyle but we love you\" that OP's story seemingly implies. It's possible I'm wrong, but the pattern is very familiar to me.", ">that\u2019s pretty progressive for most churches\n\nThis is why I don\u2019t go to church. Not treating LGBT people like crap is a basic requirement of not being an AH, not something to hold up and be like, \u201cAh, yes! Our church is so great because it doesn\u2019t treat certain people like crap as much as most other churches do!\u201d", "Probably time for you to step down.

Im Bi. Im part of \"the\" LGBT. It is literally called the  LGBT(QIA+) Community. People who arent really in contact with it often dont know the additional letters since it was referred to as LGBT before and the \"the\" is literally a part of the sentence. Not saying OP is right but that is a stretch to me", "1. Both of them have different identities from each other. I wasn't sure how to phrase that one. \n\n2. Our church doesn't perform same-sex marriages, but they are out and accepted by the church and their families. There is no expectation of celibacy. They are both in relationships iirc and have brought partners to events before.\nThe reason they're in our group was originally due to the generation gap, not any policy.", "A and C) I agree, church culture is often uncomfortable with LGBT people. Some churches are gradually going through a culture change while still being behind. I can't speak to the environment of this church but as churches grow, for me the inclusion of openly LGBT people who are also dating is a green flag. If the intentions are good, learning the right language will hopefully follow.\n\nB) I mean, if there's one other openly LGBT person in the church I also wouldn't sit around hoping another might join who I want to date. Of course more LGBT people might join, as far as we can tell, but it doesn't sound like this is a big church if there are only 7 married couples in this group and only one 18-30 year old, so those aren't great chances to find someone compatible.\n\nD) so have I. But based on my experience, the fact that these people are 1) still active members of the church as adults, 2) open about their sexuality, 3) openly dating, 4) dating outside the Church and still included (despite the fact that the atmosphere seems generally kind of clicquey) is a pretty significant indication to me that this is a pretty progressive church. Usually the 'I love you but disagree with your lifestyle' people will not consider you part of the in-group if you are actually 'living that lifestyle'. Even dating outside the church in general would already exclude you from being considered a full member in a lot of places. \n\nI could also be wrong of course, but that's my impression. Perfect affirming community? Probably not. But the marginalisation of LGBT people doesn't strike me as the main issue here.\n\nEdit: that last sentence could be read as not thinking the marginalisation of LGBT people would be an important issue. What I mean is of course that my impression based on OP's comment is not that that's what's happening, but that there are other problems that need to be adressed.", "But OP isn't referring to the LGBT community in their sentence.

Your church is better than some, but it's got a lot more growth to do.", "Info, has this guy told you that he is straight?", "It's fine that you think that.", "You should reread it OP said they HAVE brought partners to events", "But are not doing it now and apparently didn't do it consistently before.", "How often do you think small churches have events? How long do you think these people have been in relationships?\n\nYour making a bunch of assumptions off information you don\u2019t have"]}
