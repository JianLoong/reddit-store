I know, I know. Church is lame, etc. We currently have 17 people. 7 couples, and 3 people that got absorbed into our group within the last few years due to special circumstances: a young widow, and two other members that wouldn't fit into a single's group.  \n\nRecently, a new family joined our church. Their oldest son is 22 years old and unmarried. At our church, we try to make sure that there's a small group option for every member. Our Single Young Adults group would be a good fit for him, but we have a tiny gap where there aren't really any single 18-30 year olds right now, so the group would have one person: him. There's been a major push to combine the two groups for the last few years now, but we've been fighting it because there will be a large influx of people in that group in the next two years. \n\nHowever, right now it's a party of one, so he wants to join our group. We really don't think that's a good idea. The Single Young Adults group is basically a dating group. It's not explicitly that, but everybody knows it. Our church has cultural roots, so it's VERY common for young adults to only attend to spouse hunt there. The single members here really don't want to bring that kind of energy into the group or feel like they have to deal with unwanted attention. I don't want to make them uncomfortable or feel like I'm constantly monitoring either, but there's also an administrative concern.\n\nAs leadership really wants the groups combined, if we have people who are single and aren't clear special cases, they're going to call it and not allow separate groups. As I said above, there's about to be a huge influx of new young adults, so if the two groups are combined, I'm going to end up responsible for all of it. I don't want to run a dating group and open myself up to everyone's opinions (as the Singles group is the most stigmatized). I never would have taken this position if it involved that and while I feel bad for this guy, I want to keep the groups separate far more.\n\nI'm still saying no, but there's a lot of infighting about this. Some members are on my side and some say we need to be more inclusive. Am I in the wrong here? All I want is to keep the groups separate and avoid weird vibes.", "created_utc": 1686755062, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/149a81i/aita_for_not_wanting_to_let_a_single_man_join_a/", "score": 8, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
