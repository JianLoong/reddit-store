AITA?\n\nMy opinion is that if your sitting at a red light staring at your phone and hear a beep and your reaction is slam the gas, that\u2019s a you problem, and it means you probably stare at your phone and get distracted and honked at frequently enough that you just assume there\u2019s space in front of you to move", "created_utc": 1677502716, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11db92a/aita_for_giving_a_courtesy_beep_at_a_horrible/", "score": 68, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you honk, the car directly in front of your car will always assume it\u2019s directed at them.", "Right, because the horn makes a different sound for that.\n\n/s", "Hahhaha ok.", "I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I bite my thumb", "NYC isn't the planet, it's not even a good comparison for other big cities. Literally one of the first things people think of when they think NYC is too many people honking for no reason.", "I also live in NYC (native New Yorker) and this is a gross exaggeration. People honk if you\u2019re not moving when the light turns green, yeah. No one courtesy honks? If someone started honking at me while the light was red, I\u2019d pull up alongside them and give them a piece of my mind. It\u2019s AH behavior.", "Can you hook me up with wherever you and op are getting their crystal balls? Honking at someone at a red light because they *might* be looking at their phone later when the light turns green is bonkers.", "for all we know people are waiting in case someone is trying to beat the red. i live in nyc and i would never immediately start driving after a red turns green. hell people run fully red lights here constantly.", "Oh no! You lost a couple of seconds of your life because someone was more cautious than you! \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f how terrible! Not sure what the rules are about doing this, but I\u2019d say that you and the OP are both YTA. \ud83d\ude06", "It does make them the asshole if they\u2019re only honking because they\u2019re inconvenienced for a couple of seconds. If someone gets enraged because someone else is slow at pulling away when a light turns green, I\u2019d recommend that person get therapy.", "Personally, my first thought is of pizza rat. \ud83d\udc40", "....huh?\n\nEdit oh I see what the was in response to now lol okay"]}
