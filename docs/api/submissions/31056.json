She's a wonderful person, very loving and creative and social, but also has mental health issues and sometimes gets manic or depressed.\n\nShe is single with no kids and a complicated dating history. She is impulsive and romantic and falls madly in love very quickly. Her last serious relationship was destructive, a bad mix of two people who were crazy about each other but brought out the worst in each other and hurt each other a lot. Since then she's had a few flings, each of which she insisted was a serious relationship until it wasn't. She's mentioned lately about feeling a bit sad and doomed to be alone forever. \n\nFF to now, Maud has met a new guy, Ricardo. He is from a different country and is here for a long term work contract, but is not here permanently or with any stability. They met two months ago and have been inseparable. I have been traveling so haven't met him. I just got back and she wants to introduce us which of course I am keen on.\n\nToday she sent me a message out of the blue announcing that they're getting married, she even included a date about 6 months away. Then a few hours later she sent another message, with a very weird tone, asking me to please not post this on social media or tell anyone because Ricardo is a very private person and is very sensitive to energy and they don't want their marriage to be public. The only people who can know are the 5 friends who are invited. \n\nThis is sending up so many red flags for me. I don't know this man, I don't know what their relationship is like, but I'm freaking out because \n1. They're planning to get married so fast, which she says is something she's always wanted but we've known each other since high school and marriage has never been a priority \n2. All of this is weirdly secretive because apparently he's so sensitive. I know the message telling me to keep it quiet came from him not her, I know her tone and way of engaging with people and that wasn't it \n3. They're planning a tiny wedding and again few people can know. Maud is a social butterfly with hundreds of friends but she says she's happy to tone it down and have a quieter life because that's what he needs. She insists she's loving it but I feel like she's isolating herself \n\nAll of which said, she is an adult, and she sounds super happy for the first time in ages. Part of me wants to just be happy for her, but part of me (the part that spends too much time on Reddit) is very concerned. So, WIBTA if, instead of being the supportive loving friend she needs, I am honest with her about what I think, that there is something wrong in this situation?

Meet him first. Then maybe google him?", "NTA. Sounds super sketchy. How would she react if you took her out for a coffee or a drink and talked to her one on one about her message (determine if she sent it) and why this wedding goes against everything you know about her nature? I would say - ask questions, phrasing it as \"would this aspect of the wedding make you happy?\" E. G., \"Would having 5 attendees make you a happy bride?\" - you'll come across as sensitive rather than having a laundry list of concerns that may make her feel attacked.", "NTA, but be delicate and slow... or you may just close her off to talking with you. I would be concerned as well. It may not factor in at all, but there is also likely an intrinsic motivation for Ricardo to get married for the ability to stay in the country, long-term. Whether he says so or not. Maybe a factor for him, maybe not. But it\u2019s a classic low key scam - and the 2 month timeline to proposal gives me those vibes. \n\nIn your shoes I would take it slow and form your opinion over time. You have 6 months. Get to know him. Realize that if he\u2019s scamming her it won\u2019t be obvious - he\u2019ll just seem charming - but you might pick up on something.\n\nBut yes. It sounds likely that, even ignoring the less likely possibility of a scam, shes likely in for a lot of hurt. If you spend all of your time with someone over two months, you do get to know them a lot faster, then a less whirlwind romance. But it\u2019s still very early to be able to draw conclusions about marriage, at least for my own comfort level. And this is coming from a guy who got engaged (and later divorced) when I was proposed to after 6 months by a marvelous person. No regrets but we obviously didn\u2019t match long term. 6 months to engagement was super fast in all of my friends eyes and they weren\u2019t right or wrong. It\u2019s your friends life - but it\u2019s good she has you watching out for her too.", "you should meet him before you tell her she's making a mistake. Her first reaction would likely be \"you don't know him at all!\" which would be true. Also, if the wedding isn't for 6 months, given what you've said about her relationship history, there's a good chance they'll break up before then. YWBTA if you give her all this unsolicited advice without hanging out with the guy at all.", "He's married", "I don\u2019t know how your friend will react but I think the best thing you can do is sit down with her and discuss this in a very friendly and respectful way. Don\u2019t let this break your friendship. NTA", "NTA. If you are truly friends, she would appreciate your concerns and would listen to them. That doesn't mean that she has to agree with you, but she should hear you out nonetheless. Make sure in your conversation with her, you also include how you're so happy to see her this happy, but you are just trying to watch out for her well being. If you are calm and honest in the conversation, and also respect her decisions, I see nothing wrong with bringing up your concerns. Good luck! :)", "NTA.\n\nYou know your friend well and you feel something is not right.  I would wait to say anything until after you meet him. If you still feel something is not right, then talk to her. Be gentle and make sure she knows your concern is simply because you care about her and you want her to be happy.", "NTA, sounds like you have reason for concern. But, expect her to push back, say you are wrong about the whole thing, and her possibly ending your friendship.", "NTA she needs to find out if he\u2019s married in another country, because it sounds super suspicious", "NTA you're just worried about your friend, having being in a similar situation I would recommend just be there for her, if it turns out OK, you will be so happy to have witness your friends happiness, but if  you are in the right, you will be glad to be by her side, if you try to impose your point of view while she is blindly inlove, you could lose her.", "I was married to a bi-polar man.  Maude sounds like him.  Support your friend but be there when this collapses.  Also watch out for abuse.  \n\nNTA but I think you should go anyway.", "YWNBTA at all.

By support I mean attend, yes, but also just generally be supportive - be excited with her, listen to her talk about how wonderful it all is, basically just be the best friend who's there to get excited with you when you're newly in love. I could do all that but I would also have to swallow my feeling that something is off here", "Fair point", "If anything, I think you could be the excited best friend (ostensibly) and chat it up to hopefully get more details..\n\nAnd determine how to tread carefully from there depending on the info that is given during these chats.\n\nSuper-weird situation.
