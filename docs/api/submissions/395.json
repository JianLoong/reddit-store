Mind you both we\u2019re a issue before the but seem to exacerbated after the move. \n\nWe don\u2019t really talk much anymore I spend most of my time out either at training, working, university or spending time with my partner. \n\nWe used to mostly talk about football and and he would try to coach me with stuff we watched on the the internet, which I sometimes appreciated and other times hated as he would try to force things on me. One time I snapped and told to him to F***off when he tried to continue to force things on me that I didn\u2019t want and had expressed so several times in the past. \n\nI have apologised for this and it has been over a year since. He doesn\u2019t really come to my games anymore, if he does show up he is there for the shortest amount of time possible. He gets there late and leaves before the game is over. So I can\u2019t even try to talk with him about it afterwards. \n\nRecently he has been forcing conversations about football, what my goals are, what I\u2019m training I\u2019m doing, which usually leads to unsolicited advice and trying to talk about whatever the problem is in a very aggressive way. This usually just leads to me breaking down and crying and trying to walk away from the conversation. The fact that I get upset when he does this only infuriates him more. \n\nAm I am the asshole for wanting my dad to talk about other things rather than shoving advice down my throat?", "created_utc": 1667196770, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yi2kqy/aita_for_wanting_a_dad_not_a_life_coach/", "score": 17, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Unfortunately, some parents aren\u2019t always the best at providing everything a kid needs, or even realizing there is a need. \n\nIt sounds like your father is insecure and doesn\u2019t know what to do, so he\u2019s sticking with what he thinks he knows best.", "NTA. It sounds exactly like what I\u2019ve gone through with my dad. He\u2019s always wanted to be my mentor and coach me through my career. I\u2019ve had to have a couple serious conversations with him where I\u2019ve expressed my frustration. And if he tries to get on the subject of work I keep it vague and change the subject. If he gives me unsolicited advice, I\u2019ve begun to push back and firmly say that I wasn\u2019t asking for his opinion, I was giving him an update on my life. At the end of the day, I think our dads feel valuable when they can coach us. Just to maintain sanity we need to set some boundaries. (I\u2019m 33F btw).", "NTA", "NTA. \n\nSome parents cannot bear to live if they aren't right 100% of the time and forcing their wants, beliefs and desires on others. \n\nYou are an individual and you deserve to have your own needs and dreams fulfilled. You work hard, and you are earning the life that YOU want and it seems to be upsetting him that it isn't what HE wants.", "NTA. I mean you were an asshole when you told him to fuck off but I'm assuming that you're sorry and you won't do it again. And you were a teenager so you fucked up. \n\nI think you should tell him that you want to have designated life coaching sessions that only happen one out of every five times you hang out. Tell him that four out of five times, you want him to just ask about your life and talk about TV or movies or whatever. Tell him that you know that he's going through a hard time right now personally, but You feel like your relationship with him is suffering because he's not able to just relax and get to know you outside of achievements.  Schedule time where he can talk to you about life plans, and tell him that if he has questions that come up outside of those times, he should write them down and bring them to the next meeting. But he shouldn't tell you what to do outside of those times. \n\nThe exception to this is if it seems like you have no plan. If you don't have a plan for what you're going to be doing for the next few years, he's going to want to help you. So you need to make a plan so that he stops worrying about it. If you have a plan, remind him that you have a plan.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

You might want to see a good therapist that can help you find productive ways to end the \u201cmentorship sessions\u201d and steer the relationship back to that of adult child-parent.", "Idk you are beeing a bit over dramatic. I doubt football will be a professional career for you so he's just talking about something you can both relate to.", "So your connection growing up was football, he took you to games, came to them when you drove yourself, tried to help give you tips to improve, and now you don't want him to talk about football with you. In addition to a failing marriage, which is apparently a long-term thing, and financial issues.\n\nESH, him for not just leaving you alone at this point and finding something better to do with his time, probably finally ending the farce of a marriage, and you for crying every time he talks about football to you and then also expecting him to sit through all your games as if you haven't ruined that for him already.\n\nPoor guy.", "YTA. He's just trying to be a dad the best way he knows how to do it. Maybe it's not the way you like but he's there and he's trying. He's been \"life coaching\" you as long as you've been alive and he's probably fine an okay job at it. And you've probably needed it. We all do as kids! It's not so easy to do that for 18 years and then just suddenly stop and pretend you don't care what happens to this woman you've raised up from a little girl. Give him a break."]}
