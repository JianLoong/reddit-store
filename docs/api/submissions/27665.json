We live in opposite ends of the country so I only got to meet James a handful of times before the wedding but he seemed alright enough. Cut to six months later and our parents (69M, 70F) tell me they are offically divorced. Apparently he just up and left her. She moved in with my parents temporarily after that. \n\nAt first I was sympathetic to her but she kept insisting that he be included in family planning. If someone had a birthday party she wanted him to be invited, we had to have a family group chat with him, etc. I tried to bring up how this behavior was not healthy to both my parents, Rebecca, and our other sister Jane (40F). While Jane agreed with me in private, no one seemed to agree with me out loud. About three months after the divorce, Rebecca seemed to move on and not insist he be involved with future plans. \n\nDuring this time, my now wife, Andrea (30F) and I were planning our wedding. The divorce happened and was finalized legally before we sent out our save-the-dates and inviations. We sent our invitations in March 2023 and naturally, we only addressed our invite to Rebecca. This set her off. Apparently her and James had gotten back together in February but had not mentioned it to Andrea and I until that moment. \n\nWe stood firm that he could not come, we wanted our wedding to be about us not her melodrama. Cue her texting us about it at least once a month leading up to our wedding last month. We always told her no and our reasons why. She drug our parents into the argument and they said it would be nice for us to include James, stating he was a \"good man.\" Jane seemed to be on our side and mad she went back to him so easily. \n\nYou can probably see where this is going... she brought him to the wedding. Showed up to the rehearsal dinner with him and her dog (who I also said couldn't come). I told her after it was over that he could absolutely not be at the wedding the next day. She did finally listen to this request but diappeared after the ceremony. She wasted her meal, her lodging we paid for, and missed family photos. I was pissed that she did this to us, made everything about her. \n\nCut to a few days after the wedding, turns out everyone in my family knew he was coming and helped keep the secert from me, even Jane. So I cut them off. They refused to acknowledge what they did was wrong and keep taking her side. I told them until they apologize I will not be in contact with them. I didnt have them blocked at first but I kept getting messages berating me for being mean to Rebecca. Jane even called me a hateful, spiteful person. I have stuck to my word in this and haven't spoken to them since a few days after the wedding. But this is eatting me up. I have no idea if I did anything wrong. I can't stop thinking about every scenario. \n\nSo aita for telling my family I won't speak to them until they apologize to me.", "created_utc": 1695737401, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16sp13v/aita_for_telling_my_family_i_will_not_speak_to/", "score": 611, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your family shouldn\u2019t have lied to you to cover for your sister. \n\nBut why didn\u2019t you give Rebecca a plus one to your wedding regardless? Then you would have avoided getting into the weeds about specifically including/excluding James. If they are back together, he comes. If they are still broken up, she brings someone else.", "Question, why wouldn't you give your sister a generic plus 1? In my world any adult who gets invited to a wedding automatically gets a plus 1 invite whether they're in a relationship or not. If they want to bring a friend, cool, if not they can decline the plus 1. Don't bother inviting someone if you're not gonna give them a plus 1, especially your sister of all people.

Don't fight it, just drop the rope!", "Everything involving the wedding day itself sucks, and I'm sorry you had to deal with that. Just extremely terrible decision making from your family.\n\nHowever, what is sticking out to me is the timeline before the wedding. Can you elaborate more on what you knew about Rebecca and James's relationship before, during, and just after the divorce? \n\n*Note: the following DOES NOT EXCUSE the decisions made around the wedding, but maybe, maaaaybe, can help you contextualize them.* \n\nHere's what I'm thinking: Rebecca went through a sudden divorce soon after her wedding, but tried to keep up appearances (including James in plans, texts, etc). While she stopped that, she did then get back together with James, but told you once invites to the wedding went out. This is the point of the story that seems most important.    \n\n\n>we wanted our wedding to be about us not her melodrama.\n\nWithout any other context, this sounds unfair and lacking in compassion. Your sister and brother in law were/are going through really difficult relationship issues, and on the other side of the country from you.\n\n>We always told her no and our reasons why. \n\nAnd those reasons were... their relationship was going through a really hard patch? Again, I can see that being really upsetting to your sister. It's still your right to invite whoever you want to your wedding, but at that point in the timeline, I'm thinking YTA, have some compassion. \n\nNow, even if everything I said was 100% the reason for them acting the way they did, that's no excuse whatsoever, so of course NTA. But to me, that is where the rupture began, where you refused to include your BIL (ex, or ex-ex) because of \"melodrama\" that, per this story, did not have any evidence prior to the wedding itself. \n\nThat's what sticks out to me. I hope you're able to follow the best path for yourself, with or without your family.", "He did know, when Rebecca was trying to convince us to invite him, he was included in at least one of the group texts.\n\nHe never said anything directly to us.

She even made my SIL, married Jane, cry because she tried to get them to stop fighting around the rest of the family. \n\nPart of the reason we didn't invite him was also we had to have our numbers into the venue before we even know they got back together, so he didn't even have a spot.", "Yeah that's not how it works.
