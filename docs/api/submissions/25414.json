Their birthday's are 2 weeks apart. Jenny is extremely jealous of Emily. She will do anything to make sure Emily doesn't get any attention. \n\nThis year she decided that she wants to celebrate her birthday on the day of Emily's birthday. We tried explaining to her that it's wrong and asked her to choose another date but she didn't listen. We finally told her that either she chooses another date or there will be no birthday party for her. \n\nLast weekend was Emily's birthday and we threw a party for her. Everyone were enjoying themselves except for Jenny who was sulking in her room. \n\nMy BIL went to talk to Jenny and came back downstairs with Jenny following him. He angrily told us that he is taking Jenny out to celebrate her birthday and we can't stop him. \n\nMy husband and I were very angry but we didn't want to make a scene and ruin the party so we let them go. Later when they came back we confronted him and told him that he had no right to do this. He got mad and started yelling at us asking us if it would kill us to prioritize Jenny once. Apparently \"we are always so busy with Emily\" .

Or that you and your husband understand how unfair the whole situation was on her?\n\nYou just want to blame her for your failures.", "man YTA you basically ignored your younger child bc of another\u2019s sickness and now that she\u2019s okay you keep prioritizing the older one", "YTA\n\nAfter reading your comments, Ive changed my vote to Youre the Ahole.\n\nNOT because you wouldnt allow Jenny to celebrate her birthday ON Emilys actual birth day, but because of the way you think/speak about your younger daughter on the whole.\n\nIf Im understanding correctly, the birthday party for Emily was ON her actual birthday, but Jenny felt that the celebration of her birthday should be on the day of Emilys actual birthday?\n\nIf thats the case, then you are Not the Ahole for not allowing Jenny to usurp Emilys actual date of birth for her own party. However how many times has Jenny's birthday been shoved aside for Emilys cancer? Instead of giving the ultimatum that either Jenny change her celebration day or no birthday, you should have been telling her that HER birthday is going to be extra special grand and glorious because she has had to wait so long to be the center of your attention, for once. \n\nAnd I get that cancer is scary and awful (particularly when its your child who has it) BUT from your comments it sounds like you neglected Jenny to the point where BIL kindly stepped in and took over raising Jenny. (and your comment that he was 'trying to make you look bad' wasnt correct - he wasnt TRYING to, he DID make you look bad).\n\nYou state that Jenny needs to be more mature -- except she is ONLY 14. She ISNT mature and it sounds like she hasnt had the two of you as parents for a good part of that time. But she HAS had your BIL, so for you to speak badly of him is unacceptable. You should be thanking him for picking up the pieces of your family and helping Jenny feel valued at least by SOMEONE.\n\n~~BIL wasnt wrong to try and be nice to Jenny BUT he WAS wrong to yell at you and accuse you of not making Jenny a priority. He had no knowledge (other than what Jenny told him) about the reason for Emilys party being on that day.~~", "YTA Honestly after reading the post and your comments, please let your daughter go live with her uncle so she can have a loving and caring home.", "YTA. You need to make both children feel important. You know how Jenny feels, and you refuse to get her any help or do anything to make the situation better. You are her parent, too.

It\u2019s sad Emily had a tough start in life but Jenny is 2 years younger and must feel neglected, not saying you did this on purpose OP but I would look at it from Jenny\u2019s POV", "I don't think Jenny is jealous of Emily; I think she is a glass child who is desperately wanting her parents' attention and is clearly struggling to deal with her feelings.\n\nYou have obviously been through hell with Emily's cancer and that isn't something I can relate to at all. I personally don't know how I would manage in that situation and I'm sure you thought you were doing your best at the time. However, Jenny had been pushed aside for the duration of Emily's long illness and her 14 year old brain is unable to process that in a way you're expecting her to.\n\nI really think you need to stop perceiving Jenny's behaviour in terms of being selfish and jealous. Instead try to put yourself in her shoes and really think *why* she's being like this. You and your husband weren't the only ones dealing with Emily's illness - Jenny was too - and I wouldn't be surprised if her behaviours are at least partly stemming from trauma. It must've been *incredibly* frightening for Jenny, as a young child, to watch her sister battle through cancer; to witness her physically change, become weak and sick due to the chemotherapy, and the whole host of other awful side-effects that people suffer from due to the treatment. All the while, she was being sidelined by the very people she needed comfort from and, even though Emily is fine now, you admit that she is *still* getting the lion's share of attention from everybody.\n\nSo yeah, while Jenny is definitely being an AH for insisting that she has her party on Emily's birthday, as it almost always is in these situations there is a *lot* more going on here and I can absolutely understand why she is acting out like this. I therefore think you need to start showing Jenny that she is important to you too and get her into therapy to help her unpack what she has been through.\n\nYTA", "OP, please read up on \"Glass Children.\"  Because Emily was fighting something awful, you focused on her.

You are being rude, offensive and totally uncomprehensive about a situation that YOU DON\u2019T KNOW ABOUT. \n\nThen, I shall proceed:\n\n1) Jenny deserved a birthday party. No excuses. She\u2019a a teen and she probably had to grow up really fast because of the situation with her sister, so I woulnd\u2019t say she\u2019s immature, although at 14 you\u2019re not extactly the most rational being ever. \nI couldn\u2019t imagine the horrible feelings you and your husband felt for Emily\u2019s situation, as her fear. But don\u2019t forget that Jenny was involved too in this situation and had to deal with multiple traumas: neglecting and the fear of losing her sister, and also fear of death in general. \nI\u2019m not saying you did this in purpose, because it\u2019s natural that your kid needed more attention, I\u2019d say that in these situation It\u2019s difficult to not neglect, even a little bit.\nSo that\u2019s why I would sit down with her to just talk. So she could feel listened and cared about (idk if you did actually, I\u2019m suggesting).\n\n2) I do agree that I\u2019m not feel comfortable either about the way OP spoke about Jenny. She\u2019s not immature, she\u2019s a child that needs attention: you have to celebrate Emily but also Jenny, because this situation was traumatic also for her. She probably feel excluded from the three of you, since she stayed with his uncle for a long time, and needs to feel part of the family again. \n\n3) I don\u2019t know her uncle, but I wouldn\u2019t say he wants to \u201csteal\u201d Jenny from you. He probably saw or heard something you miss, because you were concerned about Emily. \n\nI would suggest family therapy, and individual for Jenny (but I think you are all traumatized from this situation, that\u2019s normal), have you ever considered to create some family time to reinforce your bond? Maybe you could also ask your family about impressions on the situation, based on their pov.\n\nGo easy on Jenny, she\u2019s been through a lot. \nAnd yourself too, I bet it\u2019s been awful times and you did your best. \nSome users in the comments should remember that you were parent of a child with cancer, that\u2019s not really a simple parental challenge.", "The comments suggesting family therapy are spot on. Go for it. Also, confront your BIL. He was hella wrong here. No adult has any business allowing themselves to be used to split a family. No way. He was wrong.

My sister is an amazing human being and I am so fucking proud of her). My parents did everything they could to make me feel included (when it was possible) they were wonderful and we were treated no differently until it came to school stuff. My sister would get incentives. For example, when she was around 10, she had a project to do, and if she did well, she could have a hamster. She did well and got her hamster. I was never given such things. During the time of her acting out any time she did something well (got an a on a homework assignment or did well on a test) they would make a huge deal of it, if I did something well I got \"OK great, well done\"(not with any excitement or anything but it was always genuine) I always felt lacking. Obviously, as an adult, I completely understand why all of this happened, and I have very little resentment (I can't say none because I would be lying, but it's a very, very small amount). However, I do have this constant need for recognition, and I'm constantly looking for approval. My parents acknowledged my feelings. They understood, and they bloody tried. They were wonderful, and my childhood was great (for the most part). \n\nWhile what your daughter did was a little spiteful, it was also a cry for help, and the only person who noticed was her uncle.

I don't know how to explain to OP she's not her daughter's peer, she's her guardian, guide, mentor and protector. \n\nOP, when your daughter was four years old and (say) weeping with rage that you wouldn't let her have ice cream for dinner, would you have gone to a third party to adjudicate the conflict? Or would you have gently helped your young daughter manage her emotions, established a firm boundary (no ice cream for dinner), and moved on? Your daughter is a lot older now, but you still need to be in that mindset of responding to emotional outbursts with a guidance-focused, compassionate, parental mindset, not treating her like any other peer you've had a disagreement or conflict with.", "clearly the uncle HEARD Jenny and thats why he got so angry and took her out.", "Jenny needs to move back in with the uncle\u2026where she can get some love and attention while going LC to NC with her parents.

You needed to take turns with both girls, with maybe some help from relatives and/or friends to watch Jenny on occasions where things are going to get more scary than usual or you were going to receive big news.  It's a no-win, but what you needed to do if you didn't want to lose Jenny.  I can imagine your tanks were running on empty, but you had to reach deep and find something more to give.    Jenny existed and needed her parents too.\n\nThis is about her wanting proof that once - just once - she's the priority.  Look past what she's doing and see why.", "Right? Those comments - she sounds awful. Thankfully Jenny has the BIL to care about her, her mother (and presumably father) obviously don't. I would ask how Jennys birthdays were celebrated in previous years, but we clearly see that it wasn't with the parents...", "OP's comments makes me wonder if Jenny's birthday was forgotten in the past", "This comment is wild. You shouldn't accuse parents of not liking their second child as much. Also, Jenny is clearly nagging for attention, but you can't say what she did in this particular situation wasn't selfish. It absolutely was. She was trying to be selfish. Because she's begging for the attention she hadn't been getting for most of her childhood.", "My interpretation is she asked for a joint party. That\u2019s actually a reasonable request.", "Explain.", "How could OP train her daughter when she's been an absentee parents her daughter's entire life?", "Would you have neglected your youngest child so badly they went to live with your BIL?", "Wow! TIL that's how it's spelled", "It sounds like Jenny wanted to be prioritized over her sister just once. After being ignored for so long I came blame a kid for doing that.", "She won\u2019t. She even went as far as to *blame* BIL for her child living with him while they were taking care of Emily.. and why? Because she thinks he wants to BE HER DAD. Like what kind of mental gymnastics is that?", "If Jenny is immature then that's because YOU didn't do enough to help her mature. Do you think that happens magically? You can just pop kids out and they learn, grow, and mature allllll on their own? They don't. You failed your child and want to pretend it's her own fault, it's not. YOU were responsible for her, YOU were supposed to be there for her, and YOU are 100% to blame for how awful Jenny is feeling and how \"maturely\" she's handling it. Maybe she'd be doing better if she had two parents like her sister did, but alas you chose not to give that to her. \n\nYour daughter thought that now that her sister was better that SHE could be prioritized for once and instead of seeing her need and letting her know that her sister's birthday wasn't the time, but you could plan something special with just her at a later date to give her the attention she's clearly STARVING for, you decided to show no sign at all you care for your second daughter and threatened her instead. Her needs are once again completely ignored and on top of it, you took away her birthday and chose NOT to celebrate her life at all. If you were trying to reinforce her insecurities about being loved and cared about, then you did a great job. \n\nYou only have a couple years left to pull your head out of your a$$, get your child therapy (and probably yourself too, because you clearly need help understanding emotions), and find a way to make up for all the time you lost with Jenny while you were focusing on your other child. If you don't you will lose Jenny and you will deserve it. Children have emotional needs and you DID neglect Jenny's, whether you want to admit it or not. A child should not have to literally have cancer just to know her parents care about her, it should be said, shown, and reinforced constantly. If you don't want your second child then you need to just admit it so she can just go live with her Uncle and quit trying to force you to be the Mom she desperately needs. YTA and Jenny deserves better, I hope you choose to do better.", "Stop blaming your literal child for her immaturity. Do you know whose job it is to model and reach maturity to a child? That\u2019s what parents do. Kids want things that are immature sometimes and it\u2019s your job as her parent to help her grow out of it, not punish her for it.", "You obviously favor Emily.

I know people sometimes seem to treat this sub as a way to check if their reactions make sense in a situation, but most of the time it\u2019s more like some sort of freak show. For something as serious as really any kind of parenting issue it\u2019s damn near irresponsible to throw that to crowd that most of the time is just here for the spectacle. I\u2019d almost take it as a straight up sign of bad parenting to be taking this stuff to AITA.

More amazing, on AITA. Sometimes, people of the internet can surprise you.", "I think you, like many, misunderstand this sub.  OP has asked \"Am I The Asshole\", not \"Is a specific person an asshole\".  OP isn't saying the child is an asshole, just asking if they were for how they handled it.  As for the BIL, he was an asshole for supporting what the other daughter was trying to do.  While they need to do things to show the other daughter she is just as important, neither daughter is young enough to deny why having cancer caused temporary priority for one.

But yes ONE of you should have gone to Jenny's basketball game, ONE of you should have prioritized her, but you didn't and now you're surprised she's acting out? \n\nYou both didn't need to be there for Emily's chemo sessions. You neglected your younger daughter rather than trying to prioritize both girls. Thank God her uncle recognized the neglect and did what he could to be there for her since you refused to be. \n\nYTA..... Not to mention a disgraceful and neglectful parent.

You expected an 11 or 12 year old to do this stuff without being sad or feeling neglected when it is perfectly acceptable for one parent to go one way and one to go another. You both WANTED to go to chemo with your older kid and that's not cool sorry. Not at all.\n\n If anyone should have been showing some maturity in this situation it should have been your older kid, while it is scary for her she should have been the one to make a concession, yeah ok I choose mom to go with me because Jenny needs someone too. But you asked your pre-teen who was also scared, probably, to be ALONE in all these instances. So's eh solved the problem, it was clear she was never going to get any support from you while that was going on, so she sought it elsewhere instead of pushing you while Emily was sick, and you are mad about that?

Probably Emily's birthdays are better.\n\nAlso I find it telling that OP didn't say whose bday is first. Like, did Jenny want to celebrate her bday 2 weeks earlier than it was? It would be very weird. Or did the poor girl have no party at all in the whole two weeks before her sister's bday? Like, hello, parents had two weeks to make a surprise party, I doubt any kid will reject their favorite activity if it would be offered on whatever day.

She needs some grace from the adults around her, but she\u2019s getting ultimatums then blamed for making wrong choices.", "Saying they \u201cchose wrong\u201d seems incorrect to me. Clearly they failed to make their other child not feel ignored while the other went through cancer treatment and they should have been doing much more to make her feel like she\u2019s also important since then, but it\u2019s not the wrong choice to say she can\u2019t have her birthday party on her sister\u2019s birthday. The younger daughter likely has been ignored and I think your guess at her motive was spot on, but throwing out the other daughter\u2019s birthday would have still caused problems. Where they made the wrong choice was not trying to rectify the imbalance In attention and preventing this from happening in the first place.", "I don't think they did.

And young kids don\u2019t understand the crisis.", "But she doesn't have chemo anymore. You don't have to prioritize her anymore. Now you need to start repairing your relationship with Jenny.

Kids are smart. They will know.", "And/or both parents wanted to be there.", "I agree that her parents need to consider jenny's feelings more and to  take up more time with her so she can feel like she's a priority also.

But no op ignored her straight up. The reality is they had two kids and one parent should have been supporting their other kid while one was at chemo supporting the other. Particularly when if we think about it does it take 2 years to go through this and be in remission? Jenny was 11 or 12 when this all started. She had no chance.
