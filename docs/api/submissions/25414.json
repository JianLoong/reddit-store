We tried explaining to her that it's wrong and asked her to choose another date but she didn't listen. We finally told her that either she chooses another date or there will be no birthday party for her. \n\nLast weekend was Emily's birthday and we threw a party for her. Everyone were enjoying themselves except for Jenny who was sulking in her room. \n\nMy BIL went to talk to Jenny and came back downstairs with Jenny following him. He angrily told us that he is taking Jenny out to celebrate her birthday and we can't stop him. \n\nMy husband and I were very angry but we didn't want to make a scene and ruin the party so we let them go. Later when they came back we confronted him and told him that he had no right to do this. He got mad and started yelling at us asking us if it would kill us to prioritize Jenny once.

Or that you and your husband understand how unfair the whole situation was on her?\n\nYou just want to blame her for your failures.", "man YTA you basically ignored your younger child bc of another\u2019s sickness and now that she\u2019s okay you keep prioritizing the older one", "YTA\n\nAfter reading your comments, Ive changed my vote to Youre the Ahole.\n\nNOT because you wouldnt allow Jenny to celebrate her birthday ON Emilys actual birth day, but because of the way you think/speak about your younger daughter on the whole.\n\nIf Im understanding correctly, the birthday party for Emily was ON her actual birthday, but Jenny felt that the celebration of her birthday should be on the day of Emilys actual birthday?\n\nIf thats the case, then you are Not the Ahole for not allowing Jenny to usurp Emilys actual date of birth for her own party. However how many times has Jenny's birthday been shoved aside for Emilys cancer? Instead of giving the ultimatum that either Jenny change her celebration day or no birthday, you should have been telling her that HER birthday is going to be extra special grand and glorious because she has had to wait so long to be the center of your attention, for once. \n\nAnd I get that cancer is scary and awful (particularly when its your child who has it) BUT from your comments it sounds like you neglected Jenny to the point where BIL kindly stepped in and took over raising Jenny. (and your comment that he was 'trying to make you look bad' wasnt correct - he wasnt TRYING to, he DID make you look bad).\n\nYou state that Jenny needs to be more mature -- except she is ONLY 14. She ISNT mature and it sounds like she hasnt had the two of you as parents for a good part of that time. But she HAS had your BIL, so for you to speak badly of him is unacceptable. You should be thanking him for picking up the pieces of your family and helping Jenny feel valued at least by SOMEONE.\n\n~~BIL wasnt wrong to try and be nice to Jenny BUT he WAS wrong to yell at you and accuse you of not making Jenny a priority. He had no knowledge (other than what Jenny told him) about the reason for Emilys party being on that day.~~", "YTA Honestly after reading the post and your comments, please let your daughter go live with her uncle so she can have a loving and caring home.", "YTA. You need to make both children feel important. You know how Jenny feels, and you refuse to get her any help or do anything to make the situation better. You are her parent, too.

It\u2019s sad Emily had a tough start in life but Jenny is 2 years younger and must feel neglected, not saying you did this on purpose OP but I would look at it from Jenny\u2019s POV", "I don't think Jenny is jealous of Emily; I think she is a glass child who is desperately wanting her parents' attention and is clearly struggling to deal with her feelings.\n\nYou have obviously been through hell with Emily's cancer and that isn't something I can relate to at all. I personally don't know how I would manage in that situation and I'm sure you thought you were doing your best at the time. However, Jenny had been pushed aside for the duration of Emily's long illness and her 14 year old brain is unable to process that in a way you're expecting her to.\n\nI really think you need to stop perceiving Jenny's behaviour in terms of being selfish and jealous. Instead try to put yourself in her shoes and really think *why* she's being like this. You and your husband weren't the only ones dealing with Emily's illness - Jenny was too - and I wouldn't be surprised if her behaviours are at least partly stemming from trauma. It must've been *incredibly* frightening for Jenny, as a young child, to watch her sister battle through cancer; to witness her physically change, become weak and sick due to the chemotherapy, and the whole host of other awful side-effects that people suffer from due to the treatment. All the while, she was being sidelined by the very people she needed comfort from and, even though Emily is fine now, you admit that she is *still* getting the lion's share of attention from everybody.\n\nSo yeah, while Jenny is definitely being an AH for insisting that she has her party on Emily's birthday, as it almost always is in these situations there is a *lot* more going on here and I can absolutely understand why she is acting out like this. I therefore think you need to start showing Jenny that she is important to you too and get her into therapy to help her unpack what she has been through.\n\nYTA", "OP, please read up on \"Glass Children.\"  Because Emily was fighting something awful, you focused on her.

You are being rude, offensive and totally uncomprehensive about a situation that YOU DON\u2019T KNOW ABOUT. \n\nThen, I shall proceed:\n\n1) Jenny deserved a birthday party. No excuses. She\u2019a a teen and she probably had to grow up really fast because of the situation with her sister, so I woulnd\u2019t say she\u2019s immature, although at 14 you\u2019re not extactly the most rational being ever. \nI couldn\u2019t imagine the horrible feelings you and your husband felt for Emily\u2019s situation, as her fear. But don\u2019t forget that Jenny was involved too in this situation and had to deal with multiple traumas: neglecting and the fear of losing her sister, and also fear of death in general. \nI\u2019m not saying you did this in purpose, because it\u2019s natural that your kid needed more attention, I\u2019d say that in these situation It\u2019s difficult to not neglect, even a little bit.\nSo that\u2019s why I would sit down with her to just talk. So she could feel listened and cared about (idk if you did actually, I\u2019m suggesting).\n\n2) I do agree that I\u2019m not feel comfortable either about the way OP spoke about Jenny. She\u2019s not immature, she\u2019s a child that needs attention: you have to celebrate Emily but also Jenny, because this situation was traumatic also for her. She probably feel excluded from the three of you, since she stayed with his uncle for a long time, and needs to feel part of the family again. \n\n3) I don\u2019t know her uncle, but I wouldn\u2019t say he wants to \u201csteal\u201d Jenny from you. He probably saw or heard something you miss, because you were concerned about Emily. \n\nI would suggest family therapy, and individual for Jenny (but I think you are all traumatized from this situation, that\u2019s normal), have you ever considered to create some family time to reinforce your bond? Maybe you could also ask your family about impressions on the situation, based on their pov.\n\nGo easy on Jenny, she\u2019s been through a lot. \nAnd yourself too, I bet it\u2019s been awful times and you did your best. \nSome users in the comments should remember that you were parent of a child with cancer, that\u2019s not really a simple parental challenge.", "The comments suggesting family therapy are spot on. Go for it. Also, confront your BIL. He was hella wrong here. No adult has any business allowing themselves to be used to split a family. No way. He was wrong.

My sister is an amazing human being and I am so fucking proud of her). My parents did everything they could to make me feel included (when it was possible) they were wonderful and we were treated no differently until it came to school stuff. My sister would get incentives. For example, when she was around 10, she had a project to do, and if she did well, she could have a hamster. She did well and got her hamster. I was never given such things. During the time of her acting out any time she did something well (got an a on a homework assignment or did well on a test) they would make a huge deal of it, if I did something well I got \"OK great, well done\"(not with any excitement or anything but it was always genuine) I always felt lacking. Obviously, as an adult, I completely understand why all of this happened, and I have very little resentment (I can't say none because I would be lying, but it's a very, very small amount). However, I do have this constant need for recognition, and I'm constantly looking for approval. My parents acknowledged my feelings. They understood, and they bloody tried. They were wonderful, and my childhood was great (for the most part). \n\nWhile what your daughter did was a little spiteful, it was also a cry for help, and the only person who noticed was her uncle.

You've been giving Emily whatever she wants, to help her fight cancer and because you were scared. That, in itself, is not the worst thing ever.
