Their birthday's are 2 weeks apart. Jenny is extremely jealous of Emily. She will do anything to make sure Emily doesn't get any attention. \n\nThis year she decided that she wants to celebrate her birthday on the day of Emily's birthday. We tried explaining to her that it's wrong and asked her to choose another date but she didn't listen. We finally told her that either she chooses another date or there will be no birthday party for her. \n\nLast weekend was Emily's birthday and we threw a party for her. Everyone were enjoying themselves except for Jenny who was sulking in her room. \n\nMy BIL went to talk to Jenny and came back downstairs with Jenny following him. He angrily told us that he is taking Jenny out to celebrate her birthday and we can't stop him. \n\nMy husband and I were very angry but we didn't want to make a scene and ruin the party so we let them go. Later when they came back we confronted him and told him that he had no right to do this. He got mad and started yelling at us asking us if it would kill us to prioritize Jenny once. Apparently \"we are always so busy with Emily\" . The thing is, Emily was battling cancer for a very long time (she is ok now) and she needed most of our attention and while I understand that Jenny felt like she wasn't a priority, I think she was being very selfish.", "created_utc": 1692892128, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1605ncq/aita_for_not_celebrating_my_daughters_birthday/", "score": 26, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

However how many times has Jenny's birthday been shoved aside for Emilys cancer? Instead of giving the ultimatum that either Jenny change her celebration day or no birthday, you should have been telling her that HER birthday is going to be extra special grand and glorious because she has had to wait so long to be the center of your attention, for once. \n\nAnd I get that cancer is scary and awful (particularly when its your child who has it) BUT from your comments it sounds like you neglected Jenny to the point where BIL kindly stepped in and took over raising Jenny. (and your comment that he was 'trying to make you look bad' wasnt correct - he wasnt TRYING to, he DID make you look bad).\n\nYou state that Jenny needs to be more mature -- except she is ONLY 14. She ISNT mature and it sounds like she hasnt had the two of you as parents for a good part of that time. But she HAS had your BIL, so for you to speak badly of him is unacceptable. You should be thanking him for picking up the pieces of your family and helping Jenny feel valued at least by SOMEONE.\n\n~~BIL wasnt wrong to try and be nice to Jenny BUT he WAS wrong to yell at you and accuse you of not making Jenny a priority. He had no knowledge (other than what Jenny told him) about the reason for Emilys party being on that day.~~", "YTA Honestly after reading the post and your comments, please let your daughter go live with her uncle so she can have a loving and caring home.", "YTA. You need to make both children feel important. You know how Jenny feels, and you refuse to get her any help or do anything to make the situation better. You are her parent, too.

It\u2019s sad Emily had a tough start in life but Jenny is 2 years younger and must feel neglected, not saying you did this on purpose OP but I would look at it from Jenny\u2019s POV", "I don't think Jenny is jealous of Emily; I think she is a glass child who is desperately wanting her parents' attention and is clearly struggling to deal with her feelings.\n\nYou have obviously been through hell with Emily's cancer and that isn't something I can relate to at all. I personally don't know how I would manage in that situation and I'm sure you thought you were doing your best at the time. However, Jenny had been pushed aside for the duration of Emily's long illness and her 14 year old brain is unable to process that in a way you're expecting her to.\n\nI really think you need to stop perceiving Jenny's behaviour in terms of being selfish and jealous. Instead try to put yourself in her shoes and really think *why* she's being like this. You and your husband weren't the only ones dealing with Emily's illness - Jenny was too - and I wouldn't be surprised if her behaviours are at least partly stemming from trauma. It must've been *incredibly* frightening for Jenny, as a young child, to watch her sister battle through cancer; to witness her physically change, become weak and sick due to the chemotherapy, and the whole host of other awful side-effects that people suffer from due to the treatment. All the while, she was being sidelined by the very people she needed comfort from and, even though Emily is fine now, you admit that she is *still* getting the lion's share of attention from everybody.\n\nSo yeah, while Jenny is definitely being an AH for insisting that she has her party on Emily's birthday, as it almost always is in these situations there is a *lot* more going on here and I can absolutely understand why she is acting out like this. I therefore think you need to start showing Jenny that she is important to you too and get her into therapy to help her unpack what she has been through.\n\nYTA", "OP, please read up on \"Glass Children.\"  Because Emily was fighting something awful, you focused on her.

You are being rude, offensive and totally uncomprehensive about a situation that YOU DON\u2019T KNOW ABOUT. \n\nThen, I shall proceed:\n\n1) Jenny deserved a birthday party. No excuses. She\u2019a a teen and she probably had to grow up really fast because of the situation with her sister, so I woulnd\u2019t say she\u2019s immature, although at 14 you\u2019re not extactly the most rational being ever. \nI couldn\u2019t imagine the horrible feelings you and your husband felt for Emily\u2019s situation, as her fear. But don\u2019t forget that Jenny was involved too in this situation and had to deal with multiple traumas: neglecting and the fear of losing her sister, and also fear of death in general. \nI\u2019m not saying you did this in purpose, because it\u2019s natural that your kid needed more attention, I\u2019d say that in these situation It\u2019s difficult to not neglect, even a little bit.\nSo that\u2019s why I would sit down with her to just talk. So she could feel listened and cared about (idk if you did actually, I\u2019m suggesting).\n\n2) I do agree that I\u2019m not feel comfortable either about the way OP spoke about Jenny. She\u2019s not immature, she\u2019s a child that needs attention: you have to celebrate Emily but also Jenny, because this situation was traumatic also for her. She probably feel excluded from the three of you, since she stayed with his uncle for a long time, and needs to feel part of the family again. \n\n3) I don\u2019t know her uncle, but I wouldn\u2019t say he wants to \u201csteal\u201d Jenny from you. He probably saw or heard something you miss, because you were concerned about Emily. \n\nI would suggest family therapy, and individual for Jenny (but I think you are all traumatized from this situation, that\u2019s normal), have you ever considered to create some family time to reinforce your bond? Maybe you could also ask your family about impressions on the situation, based on their pov.\n\nGo easy on Jenny, she\u2019s been through a lot. \nAnd yourself too, I bet it\u2019s been awful times and you did your best. \nSome users in the comments should remember that you were parent of a child with cancer, that\u2019s not really a simple parental challenge.", "The comments suggesting family therapy are spot on. Go for it. Also, confront your BIL. He was hella wrong here. No adult has any business allowing themselves to be used to split a family. No way. He was wrong.

Everyone were enjoying themselves except for Jenny who was sulking in her room. \n\nMy BIL went to talk to Jenny and came back downstairs with Jenny following him. He angrily told us that he is taking Jenny out to celebrate her birthday and we can't stop him. \n\nMy husband and I were very angry but we didn't want to make a scene and ruin the party so we let them go. Later when they came back we confronted him and told him that he had no right to do this. He got mad and started yelling at us asking us if it would kill us to prioritize Jenny once.

She's a child. You're not. And even if Emily needed help for \"a long time\" all of the clues are pointing to your other daughter feeling ignored and neglected, she's lashing out.\n\nEDIT: OP says Jenny moved out to live with uncle for a time, wtf. How are they so neglectful that a 14 year old moved out and they did nothing? No wake up call, no realization that they were too distant.", "INFO: when was the last time Jenny came first?", "There was no neglect BIL just has a habit of spoiling Jenny. When Emily was sick Jenny sort of moved in with BIL. She still came home of course but spent most of her time there . BIL can't have kids and it felt like he decided to just take Jenny", "That's not true she was not neglected but Emily needed more attention because of her condition", "Of course not and Emily is too mature to ask that", "They weren't ignoring Jenny's birthday. Jenny said she didn't want a party unless it was on Emily's birthday.", "I didn't want to ignore her birthday. I told her to choose another date or no birthday and she chose the latter", "What means NC or LC? Not english native speaker here.", "Reading her replies, I just hope Emily didn't need any of Jenny's parts.  \n\nNo fucking way would I ever make my kid be a donor for my other kid.   Take anything you need from me but I couldn't do that to one kid for the other.\n\n\nOp is so YTA", "Oh, the OP is the TAH. Read their comments. Jeesh.", "Dude, Jenny tried to coopt Emily's birthday ON Emily's actual birthday.  No one told Jenny she couldn't have a party or that they would'nt celebrate it.  They told her she couldn't have her birthday party on the day of her sisters birthday....which is a completely normal, reasonable response to someone wanting to play a petty game with their sister.", "I'm not playing favorites wtf. She needs to be more mature. If Emily has a chemo session and Jenny has a basketball game am I supposed to prioritize Jenny? If Jenny wants to have all thr attention ON EMILY'S birthday am I supposed to let her?", "Do why it  is okay that Jenny wants to celebrate her birthday two weeks after her actual birthday just to spite her parents and sister?!  I also get the feeling that they dismissed Jenny one time too much, but this particular situation alone doesn't make OP the ahole. \nIt is way beyond reddit paygrade if you ask me.", "It doesn't make any difference. Emily is not interested in sharing her birthday", "What the fuck are you talking about lol", "I also need to add: validate her feelings. You could do some real damage if you don\u2019t show Jenny that you understand and, most importantly, SEE her. Glass child syndrome is real", "Nah, mom and dad should realize their behavior and actions led to bil having to take care of Jenny because they were to preoccupied with their other child to care. Cancer sucks but not a reason to neglect your other child.", "At 14 she knows that she\u2019s being selfish to ask to celebrate her birthday on her sisters birthday especially if op is being truthful and told her that she can pick any other day, including her own actual birthday that is 2 weeks apart, to celebrate her birthday.", "How else is a 14 yr old supposed to act after being neglected by her parents for years?", "You might want to read the OP's comments. This is a child acting out to AH parents.", "OMG...you daughter had to move in with her uncle to get any sort of attention. You absolutely did neglect your daughter. Maybe her uncle spoiling her was his way of trying to make up for her not having parents that paid attention or cared about her.", "YTA.\n\nWay to bury the lede OP.\n\nYou allowed your other daughter to live with the uncle who took her side so you could focus on your other daughter with cancer. You don\u2019t seem to want to admit the truth that doing that was *for you* and not for either of your daughters. \n\nYou fought so hard for one kid but didn\u2019t fight at all for the other.\n\nYour daughter lacks the language and knowledge to express to you how she feels about being abandoned. Jenny is 14 *now*, how old was she when moved away? When an adolescent says they want to live somewhere else they don\u2019t actually expect their parents to say \u201cokay.\u201d \n\nBecause she doesn\u2019t know how best convey her feelings she\u2019s expressing them in ways she knows. She knows asking for a party on her sister\u2019s birthday will get her attention. She was hoping you would choose her over her sister, for once. Irrational? Yes. But that is how an adolescent/teenage mind works.\n\nIt\u2019s your job as a parent to get to what she\u2019s actually trying to tell you. It\u2019s your job to give her the tools to do that in the future. It\u2019s your job to make sure she feels as safe and as wanted as possible. \n\nYou can use whatever excuse or framing device you want, but at the end of the day you sent your daughter away. \n\nYour other daughter having cancer affected everyone in your family, including her sister. You don\u2019t seem to understand that you had two kids who needed you instead of one.\n\nTherapy. Now. Therapy often. Therapy and turtles all the way down.\n\nETA that your choices didn\u2019t just fail your one daughter but they also failed your other. Your choices meant Emily didn\u2019t have her sister around while she was sick. You denied her that extra comfort and support along with Jenny. You denied them the chance to be there for each other.", "Yes there was neglect if you weren\u2019t raising Jenny, you got rid of her.", "I'm talking about long term neglect OP. I'm sure it wasn't intentional but that is what can happen when families have high needs with one (or more children), the low needs kids can miss out. \n\nIt sounds like your BIL stepped up for Jenny when you and your husband were in the thick of it with Emily's illness and made sure Jenny had an adult in her life she could rely on to show up and one that was in tune with her feelings. \n\nI know you're likely not enjoying this discourse because it comes off like people are telling you that you may have been a great parent to Emily and a bad parent to Jenny. And its true, you had to make an impossible choice and you chose the kid with the higher need, but you can't expect a *child* to not be hurt, even if they understand the logic and rationale. \n\nIt's time to put in the work and heal the toll cancer put on your family unit if you want to rebuild a healthy relationship with Jenny and get to know who she is. Or if anything, heal the relationship between your daughters.", "You're arguing over how a child feels. A child. Stop being so dismissive. Or are you jealous of BIL? You need to have some serious reflection on your family dynamics. I was young and acted like an AH, but looking back I know why. Spoiler: I haven't talked to my mother for over 10 years as an adult. I never will engage again with her. Is that what you want for your kid? For her to disengage from her family as an adult? It sounds like you don't like her, why? Because she's being a jerk? She's a kid acting out. If you really do care about your family, and not just looking for validation on Reddit of all places, you all need therapy.", "Define neglect for me", "Or maybe it was his way of making Jenny feel like she mattered to someone.", "Is the attention equal *now?*", "How do you know she didn\u2019t feel neglected?  She moved in with her Uncle. \n\nHave you ever listened to things she has told you. I mean listen and actually hear them.", "YTA and a very self centered person if you believe you\u2019re a saint and that one kid deserves all your attention (yet from the sounds of it cancer free). Maybe you should just sign custody of Jenny to your bil because you don\u2019t want to be a parent to her nor give her any attention.", "Emily is also 2 years older. You know your daughter didn't feel like a priority and she still feels less than. While you were right not letting her have the party on Emily's birthday you need to start making Jenny feel important. Other people in the family are seeing things you aren't. Have a conversation and hear them out. Ask them for examples.", "by too mature you are saying Jenny is too immature. Imagine a neglected child being immature.", "Your contempt for Jenny is disgusting. Emily doesn\u2019t know the feeling of being neglected. Maybe that\u2019s why she\u2019s so \u201cmature\u201d", "I miss read that but I am sticking with the YTA rating.\n\nMy gut is that the parents were hyper focused on Emily.\nThemselves, then Jenny. Maybe she acted out in a poorly thought manner, but she probably feels abandoned, ignored, her last few years everything was about Emily. Nothing about about Jen. Even if this wasn't how it was it was Jens perception - the parents getting angry at her reinforced Jens perception of where she falls in the importance of the family.", "You said that both you and your husband went to the chemo treatments. Was Jen left alone or with a sitter? Doesn't matter. \n\nShe feels like you abandoned her. She acted out, maybe in poorly thought out way, BUT you reinforced in her mind that she is second class by getting g angry.\n\nShe sees the pecking order as precious sister, mom and dad, other things then Jenny. \n\nThis may not have been your intention, but it's her perception of what's happening.\n\nShe may need some therapy, BUT you need to make some effort to see her side of things AND allow her some lee way to be a bit selfish for a while.", "LC is low contact and NC is no contact. So going NC means never talking to a parent again.", "yeah. At the time I had written my reply, the OP hadnt made any comments (the first one was made while I was writing my reply, so I didnt see it). \n\nIve changed my judgement.", "Her behaviour wasn't reasonable in this instance but it has likely stemmed from years of not having any control or a chance to be in the spotlight. \n\nYes, it was a jerk move, but this is a case of needing to understand the motive, not just the crime.", "Can't you and your husband alternate? One go to the game the other tske her to chemo? Then switch off. Even your family notices it. I bet you prioritize emily regardless Jenny wants a specific meal bur emily wants something else, emily wins because hse has cancer. Jenny wants to go to s movie but emily wants to go shopping emily wins because she has cancer.", "Dad can take Emily to Chemo, you can go the basketball game.", "You would need to prioritize both.

What Jenny did, on the surface, is AH behaviour. Her birthday is 2 weeks later, she could have a party on a day that wasn't her sister's bday. \n\nWhat Jenny was likely actually doing was begging for her parents to put her wants ahead of Emily's one time. It sounds like OP and her husband put *both* Emily's wants and needs ahead of Jenny and its created deeply jealousy and likely irrational emotional responses to things. \n\nThis family needs ALL the therapy.", "The point they were trying to make was Jenny wants to feel included.  She has felt second class because of Emily's cancer. Sounds like you still put Emily first even after the fact. Jenny still needs to feel important and included.", "And what Emily wants, Emily gets fuck everyone else.", "Checks Op's comments, Emily had cancer and had ALL the parents' attention for many years and seem this dynamic has not changed since Emily got better. BIL took Jenny in basically as they were neglecting her.", "Where are you getting that from? Yikes. Just because an angry BIL was shouting something? Their other child had cancer, which naturally takes up a lot of time and energy to address. There is no indication they neglected their other child.", "Or maybe it was his way of making us look bad so he can be what he wants to be: Jenny's dad", "People are obviously going to pay more attention to Emily since she just recently became cancer free", "To be clear, the \"jeesh\" was directed to OP, not you :)", "She needed us both there.

We're all asking you to drop the defensiveness and take a fresh look at the situation.  From an outsider's perspective, Jenny is begging for attention. And not because she's spoiled, but because she's felt unimportant during really formative years of her life.  Your BIL apparently shares this view.  Please at least consider it instead of only looking for validation.  Your family really does need help.  It's not too late now, but one day soon it will be.

I\u2019m sorry Emily had cancer and I\u2019m glad she\u2019s better but you\u2019re awful for dismissing Jenny the way you did. It\u2019s clear a lot of neglect and abuse lead up to this", "People?
