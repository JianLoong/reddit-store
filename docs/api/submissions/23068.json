Stay far away. Your kids even were abused by your MOTHER? Don\u2019t ever do anything for them. Go NC FOR LIFE! Come on", "I am not him ;) I take no offense. Lol. I am 100% sure he was cheating on my mom from when they first started dating. I am also pretty sure my mom got pregnant with me to trap him into a marriage. No one will ever admit anything of course. I watched them fight my entire childhood. My mom hated me and would punish me in strange ways, she would hit/slap/punch me. Meanwhile my little sister was the golden child. My dad was also in the military so he was quite often gone a lot. I have so many weird memories from when I was a kid. I had vowed I would never be like them. I actually cut contact when I was 16 and moved out of their house. I didn't get back in contact u til much later. When I found out my ex was cheating on me, I was feeling like, that's quite normal. When I told me dad, his response was basically to give him another chance... this is about when I started letting them back in my life at 22. I had also met my now husband and we got pregnant really quickly. After he and I discussed our options being we had only been dating for 6 months, and we agreed to go through with giving this parent thing a shot together at least as co parents if we weren't going to work out, I wanted my mom in my life. I really needed that adult figure. I desperately tried to have a good relationship with her. I would drive out to their place, pick her up, drive back to the city and drop her off at BINGO. like no joke, 2 hours of driving, no compensation just so I could begin having some sort of relationship with her. Whenever she was in the city, she wouldn't make an effort to visit with me. But... I still tried.  I feel incredibly stupid today for being taken advantage of.", "That's exactly how I saw it too. It's their kid. It wasn't even like I ever asked them to watch my own kids. We lived an hour away from them. So it wasn't even trading time or anything. :/ Anytime they had my boys was upon their request to spend time with them. Even then I couldn't always commit to it because the kids have things they are involved in and I can't cancel their plans to appease the grandparents.", "They were trying to force a relationship and then she would also become his babysitter when he gets him for the day.", "He says he wants a relationship with the kid. And I honestly have no idea if my mom even told him he has plans but I did text him after my call with mom and tell him sorry I won't be taking him that day. He at least texted back that he didn't know what I was talking about. These adults have been lying to me and each other for as long as I can remember. \n\nMy mother did punish me after that weekend. She wanted my boys for a sleep over. Keeping in mind we are an hour away, and I had no plans, she insisted. So my husband and I made plans to go out for dinner Friday, sleep in and get some yard work done then pick them up Sunday. \n\nMy mother mistreated my boys, she withheld food all weekend. I was totally appalled. She then told me my oldest was lying. .. and I do admit I sort of believed her because... Well she has been manipulative my entire life. \n\nIt wasn't until the next month she insisted on another weekend with her. I agreed to one overnight, and I packed a backpack full of snacks so no one would be hungry. Enough snacks to last a week! When I picked them up, the back pack was empty and my oldest told me she took away the snacks and wouldn't let them eat anything. I believed him this time. \n\nWhen I confronted my mom, I was psycho according to her. She told all my family that I was jealous my brother was getting all this attention and I was trying to make her look like the bad guy about my own kids. This is where the big divide really started to impact my family. \n\nI went no contact with them after this. I really didn't want my kids to be put through any damage. My mother used to starve me as a child when I was \"bad\" \n\nI wanted a relationship with my half brother but I don't want to be used this way. \n\nThey have been telling anyone who will listen that I won't let them have a relationship with my kids because I am jealous of my brother.... I am in my 30s this kid is like 6?? Or seven at the time. I know nothing about him except his first name. It makes me really sad.", "Run. Run fast and run far.\n\nIf you want a relationship with your half brother, you could always try to seek it through his mum.\n\nAnd if your mother is starving her grandkids to punish you, what is she doing to that poor boy to punish your dad?", "Your mom is a psycho child abuser. Do not let your boys go round to hers ever again. And if she's like this with her grandchildren she will probably be abusing your half brother. I'd call CPS. Explain what happened to you as a child, what she did with your sons and that you are worried for the safety of your half brother.", "NTA. Don't let your mother anywhere near your children. You've seen it firsthand, and I can tell you that she is never going to change her behavior. My mother is just like this, too.", "I've thought of that too :( I just hope he can speak to his mom. His mom hates me... I am the one who caught them.", "I presume she hates you either because he doesn't spend as much money on her now she's not his mistress, or because she thought if the affair was secret for a while longer she could have convinced him to actually leave your mum.\n\nEither way, I think it warrants at least a warning about how your mum might be treating her child.", "Nta", "Dm or pm me", "Dm or pm me", "Dm or pm me", "Dm or pm me", "Dm or pm me", "Dm or pm me", "Your kids need to never be anywhere near your mother.
