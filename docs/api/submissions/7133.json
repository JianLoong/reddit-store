I\u2019ll add that some of her classmates are not very nice to her. \n\nSo her birthday is coming up and she specifically asked me if we could do something, her and her 4 friends. This is what has been going on since she was young, we\u2019ve never thrown an actual giant instagram birthday party. We\u2019re not poor by any means but we\u2019re not rich and we live in a small apartment so what we\u2019d normally do is me, her, and her 4 friends would go out for ice cream and a paint-your-own ceramic activity, or something like that.\n\nHowever, word got out that my daughter is \u201chaving a party\u201d and I got an email from her teacher where she essentially called me out for my \u201clack of inclusivity.\u201d She said that she had gotten complaints from other kids in her class that my daughter was being a bully for only inviting certain people (re: her close friends) and the teacher told me that now I had to invite the whole class.\n\nI cannot afford to host a party for 30 kids, or bring 30 kids to an activity. I also was afraid of my daughter getting bullied at her own party and wanted this to be a safe space for her. So I politely told the teacher this and explained that it wasn't even a party but a get together for her closest friends.\n\nNow I\u2019m getting loads of angry emails from parents of kids who weren\u2019t invited asking me why not and pressuring me to invite their kids. One even accused me of being discriminatory against their son because he has asthma. I\u2019ve had 10 angry emails and I\u2019m starting to think maybe I should invite all the kids in the spirit of inclusivity and have it in a park or something\n\nAITA?\n\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for your wonderful comments. I have sent an email to the principal asking for an explanation, with a threat to take this to the school board. I will not give in and I\u2019m going to make sure my daughter and her friends have the lovely day they deserve, in peace and alone.", "created_utc": 1673523127, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/109xhzt/aita_for_excluding_kids_from_coming_to_my/", "score": 4863, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But 4 friends is totally fine. No kid in that class has the impression \"everyone is invited but me\". \n\n\nThis is ridicoulus", "Oh HELL NO! NTA!!! You tell those parents if they had actually taught their kids to act right maybe they'd be getting invited. You have no intention of rewarding your daughter's bullys!!", "NTA and don't you dare fold to those entitled shits!\n\nIt's your daughter's birthday. She is entitled to have a birthday she can enjoy.\n\nThat teacher is a HUGE arsehole, you need to talk to the school about this.", "Teacher has overstepped the mark here. I would understand inclusivity if out 30 kids one wasn't being invited. Never mind those entitled idiots and let your daughter enjoy her birthday. NTA", "The entitlement of those parents is wild. It's a private event. They can't bully their way into it.  It's her party, and she can have whoever she likes. How dare her teacher contact you and demand you invite other kids, I would seriously contact the school about that. It's massively overstepping.\n\nFor the love of everything that's decent, don't change her party to be inclusive of sooky classmates. If you do, it shows your daughter you're more concerned with a bunch of entitled little shits that your own kid.\n\nYou're NTA for \"excluding\" kids. But you WBTAH if you change her party to accommodate them and their entitled whining.", "Thank you for all of your lovely comments and support. I will stick to the original plan I had for my daughter\u2019s birthday. If the teacher complains again I will talk to the school about it, as everyone recommended.", "Haha ahh the parent that accused you of discriminating against their child because they have asthma is just too much. \n\nSorry you have to deal with this bullshit OP. Personally I'd also be writing a pretty strongly worded letter to the teacher regarding fostering inclusivity in the classroom seeing as kids are being mean to your daughter, and I'd be fucking furious they had the audacity to tell you you \"have to\" invite all the kids and contemplating making a complaint because that's also entirely inappropriate. \n\nGood for you upholding your daughters wishes, I'm sure she'll have an amazing day! \n\nNTA", "Nta, you are practically bullied into this.\nYour daughter's bday should be about her wishes.\nThe teacher deserves to be told to the principal. And other parents put in their place.\n\nQuestion: based on this reaction your daughter was at the party of her 30 colleagues' birthdays?", "NTA...the teacher can host the rest of the class if she's so concerned. Inviting your four good friends is not in any way discriminatory.", "Speaks volumes that the kids who bully your daughter have parents that are now trying to bully you\u2026", "NTA explain to the school that your daughter is doing a little party with her 4 best friends, and you aren\u2019t being \u201cexclusive\u201d to the other kids just because you don\u2019t want to host 30 children. This school environment sounds insane, when I was in primary school, the school never got involved in students birthday parties to try and control them. If the school wants to host their own birthday party for your kid they can do that, but they can\u2019t make you invite kids that aren\u2019t your child\u2019s friends", "Yep, those parents are fruit loops and the teacher is the worst of all, she's a disgrace. NTA. Stick to your guns. Explain it if you feel like it but you're not obliged to. It's your daughters bday and she can invite whoever the hell she wants. She should have the people who make her happy, not just because some parents (and by extension their kids) are entitled twats.\n\nFuck me, I thought I'd heard it all. I'm honestly just hoping this is fake because otherwise the world is going to shit.", "NTA that\u2019s absolutely ridiculous. The teacher has really overstepped I\u2019d make a complaint to the school. Stating that you do not appreciate this teacher interfering with your child\u2019s personal life outside of school.", "How on earth can the teacher think she can tell you to throw a party for the whole class? It's clearly not something they have any control over. The party you throw is really nothing to do with the school.\n\nI think you're NTA but maybe talk to your daughter about how she is talking about the party at school, the other kids must feel excluded for a reason and it could be because she is boasting about having a private party they aren't invited to. In an ideal world the other kids probably wouldn't even know she's having a party.", "NTA. If the get together is outside of school hours that teacher and the other parents have no say in what you do. That teacher made unnecessary drama out of this.\n\nIt's your time and money being spent. Don't give in to demands. Take the 5 out for their day and let your daughter have a fun and safe birthday \u263a\ufe0f", "NTA. People have a LOT of nerve, because when parents send out invitations to the whole class and only a few show up no one seems to care about that. I\u2019d bet money most of the people complaining wouldn\u2019t have shown up anyway. As long as you approached these 4 kids parents away from school about the celebration, what business does the teacher have emailing you to begin with? You also shouldn\u2019t allow yourself to be pressured to spend more than you have because of the complaints either.", "No way. Don\u2019t give in on this - unless you/your child ostentatiously handed out invitations in the class room you have nothing to worry about and have done nothing wrong. This is just more bullying.\n\nDelete the parent emails, and if the teacher continues to bother you about this escalate it to school administrators.\n\nNTA", "NTA. I would simply point out that you will not be bullied over this like their children attempt to bully your daughter.", "NTA\n\nReport that teacher to the school board, she\u2019s crossing a lot of boundaries and being extremely unprofessional.", "NTA!\n\nYou would be the AH if you kowtowed to the pressure from the teacher and other people though.  A small get together with her closest friends is perfectly reasonable.  I'd come up with a stock response.\n\n\"I'm sorry you heard incorrectly about my daughter having a party.  She is not having a party. I hope you have a nice day.\"\n\nAnd leave it at that.  A small get together with 4 of her closest friends is a great idea.  And COVID is still a thing too.  Turning this into something your daughter wouldn't enjoy wouldn't be fair to her.", "Nah this is insane \n\nAsk the teacher if you can go around and bring all your extended relatives for their next family get together \n\nNta\n\nSchool and other parents sound batshit insane", "NTA by any means, you are doing what your daughter wants and what is comfortable for her. If you were to give in and have a party at a park for everyone, your daughter won't be able to truly enjoy her birthday. Respond to all of those parents saying your daughter is not having a party, she is just hanging out with her friends, and you're not sure why they are hearing otherwise. You honestly don't owe any ody an explanation, and I would tell the teacher the same. I hated the rule of if you invite one, you invite them all, because my son was also bullied and this prevented his real friends from coming to his parties, since we wouldn't invite the whole class. Send a private message to the parents of the kids you want to have over and give your daughter what she wants for her day, do not budge on this. Just make sure not to send any invitations to school with your daughter.", "NTA by the teacher's logic you would have to invite everyone. It's your daughter's birthday and she can invite who she wants. Literally has nothing to do with the teacher, anyone at school or outside of school.", "NTA you did not circulate that there was a party, and you invited your daughters friends privately. The school can not force you to invite everyone.", "This can't be real. Is this for real? If it is: NTA. \n\nYou're not obligated to invite anyone you don't want to invite. It's your DAUGTHER'S birthday and it should be about HER and who SHE wants there. haha. The entire class is not entitled to the event haha. \n\nAlso, the teacher, again, if this is for real, overstepped way too far. As did the parents. How do all the parents even have your email anyway? haha. I find it hard to believe that this is for real because it's so ludicrous, but yeah, if it is...Everyone is overstepping and you should just give them all a polite \"f you\" boundary haha!", "Ignore the emails from the teacher and the parents; as long as you\u2019re not giving out invitation cards to the select invitees at school you are allowed to have a private party and you\u2019re not obliged to invite everybody in class.\n\n What are they going to do? Sue you? \n\nNTA", "NTA. And people still continue to ask me why I don't want kids. ..", "Having a birthday celebration is about your daughter, not about all these other kids.\n\nIf she wants to paint bears, or whatever, with her four friends, then pressuring her to accept a major event with a bunch of kids she doesn't like is  bullying. The teacher is essentially bullying your child.\n\nNTA, not even a little. These parents asking \"Why?\" should just be told that it's for your child's *friends*, not for her *class*, and the two are not synonyms. Clearly.", "NTA\n\n\nThis is well out of order.", "Holy crap wth business is it of your daughter's teacher what she does with her friends outside of school hours and premises NTA at all", "NTA.    I am sick of this \" you have to invite everyone \" \nMaybe school would like to find the party since it's their policy.  \n\n\nI don't invite all my coworkers if I happen to have lunch at a restaurant  with one of them  (suggestion for lunch was sent by text, not in front of whole office to hear)", "NTA.  You're being bullied by the teacher and parents.  I see where the kids may be getting this.  It's your house and your money.  There may be an argument if you had invited 20+ out of 30, but that's not what this is.", "NTA. My daughter is 4, the age where everyone invites everyone, but we did not. For one, I can't afford that and was having the party in a place that a friend was allowing us to use for free and I didn't want to overstep, and also my daughter specifically asked that her party not have too many people because she didn't want it to be too loud. I respected her wishes and she had the four friends she wanted the most and was very happy. From my standpoint, I was happy to not have to play host to people I barely know (I have become mom friends with her friends and we all get along).\n\nI felt guilty later when invited to other people's parties that we didn't invite but that's also their choice to do that and not ours. School shouldn't dictate external lives. I just invited people outside of school since we weren't including everyone.", "NTA and the teacher is crazy.  I would copy email to the principal, explaining that you had invited 4 kids and the teacher is encouraging others to harass you and your child.", "NTA. This teacher way overstepped, and I think the other kids\u2019 parents maybe thought it was a large party that only their kids were being excluded from. The usual rule is that if the party invites were shared out at school then everyone has to be invited, or if most of the class is invited all of it is, but a small group that doesn\u2019t get invited at school? Nobody\u2019s business.", "NTA. The best way to handle it is reply to all parents \"I'm sorry if there was a misunderstanding. My daughter is not having a party, but a playdate with 4 friends. I'd rather not invite a bunch of new kids to a small house playdate, but if your child is interested in coming over, perhaps we can set up a date for them next week? Let me know which days work best, and I'll be happy to host them.\"\n\nIf they are really bent out of shape for being excluded, then they'll jump on the chance to send their kid over.", "NTA, the nerve of some people! This is about your daughters birthday. The teacher or other parent have absolutely nothing to do with how you celebrate. They cannot make you throw a party for 30 kids, that's nuts. You do you!", "NTA at all! Those school policies are clearly designed to avoid 1-2 people being excluded from an entire class, not making it that every party has to include all 30 kids + whatever outside friends, family etc. are joining. It's frustrating but I think you should hold your ground and have an open conversation at least with the teacher about why you think it teaches a bad lesson to your daughter that she should have to consider everyone else's needs and feelings, particularly children who arent nice to her, above her own on her own birthday. It's also a good opportunity to talk to your daughter about this same subject! There's a difference between \"excluding\" and making yourself small or uncomfortable so that others can have a good time.", "I honestly don't get this culture of inviting everyone. If you were inviting everyone apart from one or two kids, then you'd be the asshole. But you're only inviting her closest friends. It's an intimate party. The parents are entitled idiots. Hope your daughter has a great day, NTA", "NTA. You\u2019re not responsible for throwing a party that includes other people\u2019s children. All the other parents who are emailing you are the problem and one of the reasons I try my best to avoid socializing with a lot of other parents. Raising pick me kids who can\u2019t handle missing out makes me crazy.", "This is just bizarre, IMO.  You are NTA.  This is your daughter's birthday and she can celebrate any way she wants.  How dare any outsiders try to dictate how she celebrates.  As a parent, I would feel my nerve reprimanding another parent for not including my kid at their kid's birthday \"party\", especially if they aren't even friends, sheesh.", "NTA\n\nPurposefully choosing to exclude one or two kids out of 30 would be kind of a dick move (unless you had a really good reason).\n\nBut in what kind of insane world would it be unacceptable to invite only a handful of close friends out of a class of 30, no matter what your reasons are? Like, does every play date have to include the whole class? Are they all joined at the hip?", "Nta \n\nIt\u2019s your DAUGHTERS birthday and she should get to spend how she wants and other kids aren\u2019t entitled to be invited unless you were only excluding one and even then if it was a child who bullied my child I\u2019d still put her first and leave them out", "NTA. While Asthma Discrimination is something we must never stop fighting in our society, I think it's fine to have a small gathering of 4 friends. That's the party she wants, and it's really unreasonable for the parents to expect an invitation for their child for everything.", "How did your email get out? Either way NTA that teacher is awful and teaching kids to be entitled and rude", "Definitely  NTA\n\nJesus,  what is wrong with these parents?", "Something like this could NEVER happen in my country. The teacher and the parents of the other children have NO RIGHT to dictate who you (actually, your daughter since she decides it right?) can invite to your house. Tell the parents that if the kids feel excluded they should take them to therapy, and that they are entitled to expect to be invited to the birthday party of someone they are not friends with.", "NTA. \n   This party (small or otherwise) is your daughter's. If she doesn't want anyone but her close friends, then that's how it should be. Its her day, not anyone else's. If other kids wanted to come, they should be her FRIEND first. They may be around 4 years old, but their unhappiness about it is not your problem. \n   If need be, simply explain the situation to the parents. And if they disagree or try to persuade you otherwise, stand firm (personally, I'd tell em to shove it).\nAsk your child what they want, and try to make it happen. That's how a birthday is supposed to go. No other input is required.", "How you do birthday parties for your kid is not the schools concern, that teacher is way out of line. (Unless you did the invites at school, which is not very nice of you).\n\nAs for the angry emails, give a blanket response saying that its how your daughter prefers it, and that she isnt excluding anyone because of who they are, she just dont cope with that many kids at once.

Don\u2019t let these people ruin your daughter\u2019s birthday.", "You're NTA. Birthday parties are for friends. Period. Do these parents invite every neighbor and acquaintance to every tailgate party, backyard cookout, wedding?", "Absolutely NTA. I hate schools like this! If the teacher wants you to invite the whole class, let her host and pay for it. Its outside of school therefore, no one else\u2019s business. \nThis sense of entitlement boils my piss! \nWhen it\u2019s my birthday do I invite the whole company I work for? No!

If she did, this was an error and you should send an apology to the teacher and class for the confusion. Because of bullying concerns, a lot of school have policies that anything done in the class has to be inclusive of everyone (which is good if it's, say, handing out stupid valentines cards or something similar). Basically, the classroom isn't to be used to facilitate private activities for a few people, only for things that affect the entire class. This would be described in a student/parent handbook or similar document.\n\nIf nothing was handed out in the class, you need to escalate this to the school administration. The teacher is allowing rumors to spread that are leading to harassment and bullying of you and your child. Be respectful in any communications, but do not back down one inch - most schools will try to roll over you even if you're completely right because it's easier to handle one upset person than twenty, but when you stand firm (and demonstrate that you're willing to continue to escalate), they will yield and let things blow over.", "NTA.

I have no idea what the kids of these parents are telling them, but it sounds like it's a bunch of lies. Never in my life would I think of emailing another parent to tell them they must invite my kid to someone's small intimate birthday party.
