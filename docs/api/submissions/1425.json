But I think its odd that you used the phrase with SIL in the first place.\n\nI am imagining similar situations in my life and the joke is generally only used with the people who are \"in\" on it.  In this case, when speaking directly to the student and maybe your husband.\n\nI don't think it is bad bahavior to use an inside joke outside of the people who are \"in\" on it.  But by and large I find that the \"outsiders\" rarely find the joke as amusing as the \"insiders\".  \n\nAnd because it mentions race, I can't imagine thinking the phrase wouldn't at least raise some eyebrows from \"outsiders\". Because without explanation its kind of one of those things like \"why is it important to point out that the boyfriend is black\"?  \"Why can't you just say boyfriend\"?", "NTA - I\u2019m so tired of people who have nothing to do with a situation getting so triggered.

Many black people actually prefer black to African American. She is being is just being performative and it's obvious she does have a single black person in her life if she think blacks is the same as the N-word.", "NTA, this is a running joke amongst you, your husband and him. She is the one offended and it has zero to do with her.", "NTA.  So she's offended on his behalf without even talking to him. \n\n-_- \n\n It's like people getting offended about Speedy Gonzalez without talking to the Mexican community.", "NTA.  Political correctness gone mad.  In the specific context of this story I don't see any issues with OPs comments.", "NTA.  If it was something you started, that would be different, but the student started it.  It\u2019s not pejorative, the way the N-word is.  Your SIL sounds like one of the Social Justice Warriors who goes so overboard that she basically makes a mockery out of liberal causes that Fox News uses for laughs.  I can\u2019t even say she means well since this is performative activism on her part.  I bet she\u2019d also get pissed at the student if she heard him say it and insist that he\u2019s only saying it to amuse white people, as if he can\u2019t have jokes.", "NTA she doesn\u2019t understand the relationship you have with him. He started the joke, continued it, and you played along perfectly fine.", "I wish people would stop getting offended about stuff on behalf of other people who were not offended in the first place. It devalues actual racism which quite rightly is abhorrent.

Black people are not so fragile that they need crazy white SJWs to rescue them over any imagined slight. I swear you see these people all the time on social media arguing with minorities over how a comment should in fact offend them and they just don't realize what a victim they are...lol It is actually racist in itself if you think about it.", "Thats a valid point and why I wondered if I was TA. In ny defense at this point its just habit when referring to student and cat to say that. Had cat not been going crazy over the blanket he specifically slept with I would have never said it."]}
