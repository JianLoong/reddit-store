From everything you've described, stationing you where she asked is putting more children at risk/unsupervised.  This needs to be put in writing to your \"boss's boss\" so it's on record if she pushes it with the next person and there's an incident.\n\nIt IS possible to talk and watch kids. Kids are fast and they tumble. If someone expects you to be within arms' reach of every toddler, they're going to need another 20 teachers, or have all of them playing within 3 feet of you.  She's being ridiculous.", "You seem to have a good point, but might have been lead a bit by your frustration and could possibly have been a bit more tactful in your response. I do not know what kind of person your boss is and if other things happened before that caused your reaction to be like that, but if you reacted like that to me, I would also have been offended by your tone, as it feels like you would react in this way to a child.\n\nNot the asshole, but could be a bit more tactful", "NTA. Your boss sounds like they are trying to blame someone else for their mistake. The mistake being not enough supervisors. Frankly, saying what you said was not even that big of a deal. If she doesn't know that the swings don't have a good view of the rest of the kids, she should go and take a look for herself.", "NTA. Some people have never been to preschool I guess lol and should calm down. If anything I would say it's a shame there are only two of you to watch so many kids - but you're clearly not an AH for trying to watch as many kids in the most strategic way that you can. I would venture to guess the swings aren't the full adult ones.", "NTA. I worked with children and you do the best you can to watch them but sometimes kids will be kids and do dumb things that get them hurt. \n\nWhy doesn't she just come out at Recess and watch the kids by the swing?", "NTA being a boss doesn't actually morally obligate anyone to mollycoddle you when you're being obtuse that's just a lie capitalists invented. If you're being belligerently foolish people aren't going to be respectful in their response most of the time. Professionally ill advised behavior =/= asshole behavior.", "Nta. You're looking out for the kids and she's just looking to not get sued. Keep up the good work.", "ESH\n\nYour sounds like a bit too much about some of this and you need to learn how to interact with bosses. You could have said the exact same thing in a way that wasn't intentionally condescending, insulting, and demeaning. You chose to say it that way because it felt good to you, not because it was a good idea. You're gonna have to learn to communicate better with bosses. Even when they suck. That doesn't mean taking it lying down, but it does mean not giving bosses good ammunition to make you look like an ass or worse effect your payment and such.", "Nta my friend used to work in daycare and a similar story except the kids did get out because the gate couldn't be seen is why I got into in home child care for friends and family kids", "ESH.\n\nYour boss for missing the point about covering all the kids. \n\nYou for being a rude, insobordinate acting like a child yourself. You handled that very badly.", "~~ESH~~ (see below) Your boss is for sure clueless about how to run a playground, and has no strategies to deal with kids who play. You, on the other hand, should pay attention to all the kids, not stationing yourself in just one location. Also, although I agree with *what* you said to her in substance, *how* you said it could get you worse than threats, maybe fired.", "YTA solely for the stupid and disrespectful way you dismissed your boss.\n\nThere\u2019s ways to get your point across and actually persuade people.

It\u2019s one kid fell one time and didn\u2019t get hurt and she made a big deal of it.", "Because then she\u2019d have to actually watch the kids", "Incompetent authority figures require insubordination especially when their incompetence could endanger people and in this case literal children. Just because someone is a boss doesn't mean  they're actually deserving of respect it's just professionally prudent to extend it to them.", "I think it\u2019s great for a young person to refuse to be a doormat at work. I hope OP carries that attitude with her in life, and finds ways to express it that keep her employed if she wants that.", "The front is where you can watch all of the kids. My coworker and I used to sit there before my boss said one has to be by the sandbox and now one by the swing. I already know I\u2019m not gonna get fired. My boss\u2019s mom owns the school and that woman is doing everything she can to keep me.

Hope the big boss is aware of what's happening and you document+keep proof what happened (at my kids daycare everytime my son had a bad bump or injury I had to sign an incident report that was filled in by his teacher.

She\u2019s not gonna do anything about this except maybe call her daughter out for being an idiot about the playground.", "A single kid one time. This is gonna happen even if every kids has an adult watching them. People, especially uncoordinated children playing, will fall. And 2 people can talk and watch and observe things. It's a very common and easy ability that you must know you *probably* have", "They\u2019re 3! Try to stop a 3 year old from falling. I\u2019ve had a kid fall off the slide too. Should a 3rd person be there to stand by the slide?", "You do understand that toddler's try and off themselves like it's Jackass the movie, right? It's like they try and come up with the most unique ways of doing it as well. That's why parents are always so tired, it's from keeping their kids alive.", "Jesus christ.

Nobody\u2019s getting hurt falling off. What will happen is my coworker and I won\u2019t be able to see most of the kids and they will get hurt sooner than later.", "Tell her to email you exactly where she wants you to stand just in case something happens and \u201cit was all OPs fault for standing by the swings\u201d gets tossed around.", "Well, in this case she was chatting", "I have a three year old. And it sounds like you think there should be", "I have a three year old. I recommend you watch them", "So you should know 3 year olds fall all the time even when you\u2019re standing right there", "Unfortunately the rest of us don't have antigravity eyebeams so we lack the ability to stop kids from falling with the power of our gaze.", "No. Because I watch my kid \ud83e\udd23", "Sorry, are you claiming that you make sure your 3 year old never, ever falls while playing? \n\nIf so \u2026 do you honestly think that\u2019s good parenting? A healthy 3 year old naturally falls while playing. It is good and normal for them to fall (as they engage in more activity, falling is part of the deal; falling and getting back up is an important activity for children). A 3 year old who never falls is not being given enough freedom to grow and learn."]}
