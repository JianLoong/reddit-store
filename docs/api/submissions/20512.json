It was also a good way of tracking to see if a particular child had issues with their motor skills or if too many incidents happened when a particular teacher was on duty.", "Exactly this! You need to make a paper trail for this!", "NTA\n\nWorking with small kids, it\u2019s not about preventing all injuries and incidents because that\u2019s impossible.  Can only minimize the frequency and - where possible- the severity.\n\nYour boss is forgetting this fact by only looking at facts/numbers and has removed herself from the reality that is\u2026 children will always find a way to get hurt.  I actually agree with your attitude here because you\u2019re resisting the boss\u2019s knee-jerk reaction to rewrite procedures over a single incident.  I\u2019ve been in a few jobs before where policy changes are *mandatory* after every incident, to show how we \u201cgrow and prevent repeats,\u201d which sounds wonderful on paper.

If they feel your cannot cover all of the points necessary, then they need to supply the additional staff necessary.\n\nAnd that counts the same whether it is the new hire, your boss, or the president of the United States.", "I am a teacher, with several years of preschool specifically. YTA.\n\nYour boss was justified in asking you and your coworker to split up and not spend the recess talking. 'I guess you can't do both' - no. You can't. You just identified that there are areas of the playground that you can't see even when you've split up, and teachers talking and chatting during playtime is a significant cause of distraction.\n\nThen you did split up and a kid got hurt. Not badly, and kids getting hurt is part of the deal, but when kids get hurt that's a time to revaluate and think about what to do better. If you work with kids you are *constantly* thinking about what went wrong and what you could do better, and yeah: the swing set is where a teacher should be standing. \n\nYour boss isn't on the playground with you. She is trying to manage a problem through who she thinks are two grown ass professionals - but your inexperience is showing, and your rudeness to her is unjustified. Get used to working with bosses who aren't on the ground with you. \n\n'Yes, standing by the swings would help, but then that leaves this area unsupervised....that's a problem we need to solve,'  is WAY LESS confrontational.\n\nThe solution is simple. You either need a third person at the playground (unlikely to happen) or you and your colleague need to be moving and walking so you get a better view of the play area. I've been supervising recess for 16 years and I think I can count one year where the playground in question had a good enough view that I could park my ass without walking.", "YTA. You have a serious attitude problem. Who do you think you are? I will tell you who you actually are. You are a 19 year old who works for someone else. So you do what you are told.
