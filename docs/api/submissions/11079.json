Set aside a monthly amount of fun money for each of you. Possibly set up your accounts so that your fun money is deposited into your separate personal accounts *after* comingling in the joint account used for bills.\n\nHave you considered couple's counseling, specifically for financial decisions? Less focused on the therapy aspect, you could also make an appointment with a financial advisor. If your wife hears the recommended percentages to put into savings, retirement, and college funds each month, she might be more receptive to the changing expectations.\n\nDid you and she ever have that discussion every couple needs to have, about what the threshold is for a purchase before it needs to be agreed upon beforehand? For example, I know a couple where that amount is $200; I know a different couple where it's $50. Those amounts make sense for their respective budgets. \n\nWhat's your purchase threshold? Your wife obviously thinks it's over $5k. Would she check in with you before a $10k transaction? Before buying a whole car? What's the limit?", "NTA because your wife is out of control.", "I think NTA. $37K in that time seems excessive (does she have a shopping addiction?

She should NOT be managing the money.  I wouldn't call it an \"allowance,\" but I can see why you'd want to kinda do that.  You might also want to set her up her own checking account and just deposit a decent amount in there a month.  Maybe you can both sit down, go through the monthly expenses, set aside some for savings, and what's left can be split between the two of you, 50/50.  Less like an allowance, and more like you are paying her for her job of being a stay at home mom and then instead of using the credit cards, she can use that money from her account, using her debit card, for whatever she chooses.\n\nRegarding credit cards, I would cancel/destory any duplicates and perhaps not let her use yours for the time being.  She can get one in her name, and pay from her account.  Keep in mind though, if her credit is fine now, it may not be if she gets a credit card, maxes it out, and only pays the minimum.\n\nAfter reading your last post though, I might also suggest hiring a couples therapist that specializes in money issues, or just doing some online/app based things to learn more about managing money.
