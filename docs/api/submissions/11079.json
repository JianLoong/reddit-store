Set aside a monthly amount of fun money for each of you. Possibly set up your accounts so that your fun money is deposited into your separate personal accounts *after* comingling in the joint account used for bills.\n\nHave you considered couple's counseling, specifically for financial decisions? Less focused on the therapy aspect, you could also make an appointment with a financial advisor. If your wife hears the recommended percentages to put into savings, retirement, and college funds each month, she might be more receptive to the changing expectations.\n\nDid you and she ever have that discussion every couple needs to have, about what the threshold is for a purchase before it needs to be agreed upon beforehand? For example, I know a couple where that amount is $200; I know a different couple where it's $50. Those amounts make sense for their respective budgets. \n\nWhat's your purchase threshold? Your wife obviously thinks it's over $5k. Would she check in with you before a $10k transaction? Before buying a whole car? What's the limit?", "NTA because your wife is out of control.", "I think NTA. $37K in that time seems excessive (does she have a shopping addiction?

She should NOT be managing the money.  I wouldn't call it an \"allowance,\" but I can see why you'd want to kinda do that.  You might also want to set her up her own checking account and just deposit a decent amount in there a month.  Maybe you can both sit down, go through the monthly expenses, set aside some for savings, and what's left can be split between the two of you, 50/50.  Less like an allowance, and more like you are paying her for her job of being a stay at home mom and then instead of using the credit cards, she can use that money from her account, using her debit card, for whatever she chooses.\n\nRegarding credit cards, I would cancel/destory any duplicates and perhaps not let her use yours for the time being.  She can get one in her name, and pay from her account.  Keep in mind though, if her credit is fine now, it may not be if she gets a credit card, maxes it out, and only pays the minimum.\n\nAfter reading your last post though, I might also suggest hiring a couples therapist that specializes in money issues, or just doing some online/app based things to learn more about managing money.

Understand that a SAHP salary in the US is about $112,000", "Exactly - family budget for expenses, savings, kids funds (for their educations or whatever you think they might need it for) family vacations/fun and then your wife and you each get your own personal money - which should be equal.\nYou just need a household budget.", "I like this idea. Tell her you\u2019d like to meet together with a financial advisor to make a plan to set aside some money for the kids\u2019 future.", "OP, she went to *Tiffany's* maybe you heard of it? Does she also have shoes with red soles? NTA", "NTA Fun money is the phrase you're looking for. Talk to her, explain you need to have a savings and hell set up funds for your kids and emergencies and retirement. What happens if something happens to you or the job? If theres no savings your family might be fucked. You plan for the worst when times are good. \n\n Sit down with her, make a budget together. You want monthly bills, monthly expenses like necessities, emergency savings, kids funds of some sort, retirement savings, vacation fund if you want, then whats left can be fun money split between you 2. Some save that, some spend. \n\n You also should get a reputable financial advisor. When you make the kind of money you're making you're shooting yourself in the foot a bit if you're not investing.", "NTA but definitely don\u2019t use the word allowance. You guys need a budget with allotted amounts for what she likes to go out and do. Maybe even go talk to a finance advisor together and work out trusts for your children together and a monthly budget so she can feel involved. But yeah she definitely has a spending habit and it needs to be addressed", "NTA. Maybe try and make an agreement that both partners have to discuss any major purchases, prior to the expenditure. It sounds like you have at least enough money not to notice $5k going \u2018missing\u2019 (so many of us don\u2019t have $5k in any account\u2026) so maybe the spending limit could be higher than some others. For example, it used to be my husband and I would consult each other if the purchase price was more than $100. Now, the amount is $500. It just helps everyone stay \u2018honest\u2019 and connected to the spending habits, bills, etc.", "YWNBTA \n\nI wouldn't use that term, but yeah, it's time to work up a new budget with a set amount of play money per month. She gets 0 access to your credit cards and doesn't have the ability to overdrawn her account.", "NTA", "NTA obviously. Your wife has a spending problem.\n\nOver/Under on if he proposes allowance/budget she immediately mentions divorce? Anyone?", "NTA but allowances are for children and you\u2019re going to be dead in the water if you ever call it that. Your wife deserves to know and understand how your budget is allocated and be treated like a full partner in financial matters. Maybe she grew up in a home where this wasn\u2019t talked about and she really doesn\u2019t understand it and understand what needs to be saved for the future. You might both benefit from meeting with a financial planner who could take a little heat off you as the bad guy when he/she explains how much needs to be saved for rainy day, retirement and college funds etc. then you both are on the same page and you\u2019re not the one who took away some of her spending power.", "Whoa. No. NTA.", "Agreed that \u2018allowance\u2019 may be taken as insult (teens are on allowance not adults).\n Calling it going on a budget sounds nice but also another idea taken from well, my own family\u2026\n\nBasically my uncle had been running his own company (he is rich), his wife was SAHM. The way he has sorted it is by paying her actual salary. She was doing a lot of legwork for children as well as housekeeping, etc. that is hard work and he was acknowledging that in that way. She was responsible by tanking her car, all groceries, etc but the rest was up to her. I still think it is not a bad idea. If you decided to go this way just cancel those credit cards, get her a debit one and transfer that salary amount and explain that you think that the work she puts in deserves a salary so this is how much you are giving her. Just make sure it is not a minimum wage and try to check how much people actually would be paid for her work and give her the same (or bit more). If she ends overspending then just say you allocated your resourses elsewhere you can give her 200 dollahs but that is it. \n\nIdk sounds like a reasonable idea", "Yes. His wife should see the budget, and they should do it together. She needs financial counselling and you need to make goals together, bit be kept in the dark. An allowance is not enough understanding for her.", "It's petty and I live for petty. But I imagine that wouldn't go over well in reality.\ud83d\ude42", "Who says it\u2019s not normal? Not everyone has the same baseline of normal", "The way I read it (which could absolutely be wrong), the $37k was what he added up before, then looked today and saw another $5k missing, which would make the 6-month total $42,411.34, or $7k/month. If that's correct, and OP brings home $16k/month, his wife is blowing 44% of his take-home pay on discretionary spending, and they aren't able to save. That is bonkers. He needs to put an immediate stop to it.", "Welp thats on her. You reap what you sow.", "Here\u2019s the problem - you can put her on a budget or an allowance but if she\u2019s got a shopping problem (like it appears she does), she\u2019s going to find ways to spend money. Credit cards will be opened and debt will rack up in secret. \n\nYou need to go with her to a financial planner and a therapist if she can\u2019t control it.", "Look at this from this angle, you said at one time you had 4 kids under 4 she took care of, I guess they are more grown (up) now?\nIf you have $1000 to your name, what about kids future, education and such? \nYou absolutely NEED to take her spending under control, at least ad another $1000 each month or paycheck, having no savings and at least 4 kids is recepy for disaster!", "Why downvote? Are you hungry", "It's not about who's job is harder. Having a hard job isn't an excuse to spend recklessly, be unwise, and jeopardize your family's future.", "Also, it my be \"our\" money but you're negating yourself. Sounds like it's her money as you don't have any input.", "NTA but clearly if you're only figuring out the scope of the spending now, you've both failed to properly budget -- which means keeping track of spending and saving, and sticking to a plan.\n\nI would frame it as you both need to learn to budget so you're not wasting money as a family, and you can save for your kids.\n\nHave a card/account each for 'personal spending.' Treat yourself exactly as you treat your wife. Have another account for household spending -- groceries, kid stuff etc, which you both have access to.\n\nCut yourself off credit cards for a year AS WELL AS your wife, so you can both get a better sense for what money is coming in and out.\n\nYou might not be the problem spender but by not paying any attention to where all the money goes, you're just as culpable. And if you set both of you up with personal spending a month that's separate from household & savings, your wife won't feel so attacked.\n\n(anything big, over a few $1000 that you would normally put on a credit card, should come from savings, and that means you both need to discuss it.)", " NTA\nShe will balk at that word. Family budget is better and financial planning even better. Include savings for children's education and trust. Good luck.", "NTA I think you should put her on an allowance and definitely she\u2019s literally gonna make you go broke", "NTA. Divorce her.  She\u2019s an addict and will ruin you. Sorry.", "WTF? I don't spend 37,000 grand in an entire year. Okay, I probably would if I had 4 kids, especially in this economy. She should be there watching her spending just so you can have a comfortable emergency fund and be able to start putting away for the kids' college. \n\nCall it something other than an allowance. But, she needs to control her spending. Have a talk with her. If she doesn't agree with this or continues spending after the talk, you'll probably need to have a different account for your paychecks to go into. From there you could give her an allowance, just call it something different.\n\nNTA", "NTA, first you need to cut off the money spout completely! Second you need to stop your daughters from being subjected to these pageants! \n\nYour wife is going to permanently harm your daughters and bankrupt you all in the same breath!\n\nNone of this is healthy and clearly your wife is so focused on living through your VERY young kids that she doesn't care at all about the consequences!", "I get that OP is much richer than most people here. They can go see a financial advisor, but for the less rich folks here, my family loves using You Need A Budget (YNAB). We went through a similar thing (although several magnitudes smaller lol), where I was a stay at home mom and just buying what I thought we needed and wanted. I had no idea of our financials. YNAB got us back on track", "Exactly. A budget needs to be made and she should get a separate account with \u201cfun money\u201d which is equal to the \u201cfun money\u201d that you get. Anything from the joint account that\u2019s a gift or splurge needs to be discussed before the purchase. Sounds like she needs counseling for a shopping addiction", "I agree with this. The amount that has been spent in the last 3 months could be a deposit on a house the kids in the future. This isn't fiscally responsible.\n\nThe money the wife made/the contests the won put her though college, but 100k could put the kid through college, and 37k is a deposit on a house where I live.\n\nThis really needs to be reigned in and fast. Because of you have 1k out a 8k check you are doing something wrong.", "This is what my husband & I have done for the last five years (married 20). It has been great to have our own accounts for \u201cextra money\u201d We both get the same amount & transfer it on pay day.

Sorry but I don't believe that for a second for 2 adults and 1 child unless you guys are eating like 7 meals a day.", "I listed my 2 days of the weekend meals. The lamb chops were $100 alone. I buy my meat (seafood aside) from a small local farm so pay quite a bit more then what an average person pays in a grocery store. \n\nAlso, I don\u2019t really care what you believe. It would be a super weird thing to lie about. What purpose would it serve to make it up? I gain nothing by being some random Reddit lady who pays to much for groceries. \n\nBtw, I happen to agree our grocery bill is insane but as previously stated we do not go out to eat or order any form of takeout. We live in the boonies. So literally everything we eat is homemade.", "NTA. If she had a problem with that she can get a part time job and spend that money gown how she likes. Her spending is beyond ridiculous. What she spent since September would have been university tuition for one of your kids."]}
