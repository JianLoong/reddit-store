Not because of what you said, but because they likely didn\u2019t have the context for why you said that. You have to actually tell people when something bothers you.

When my bf had a knee injury and I was helping him with his shoe, his stepdad made a joke about bf seeing me from a familiar angle. When bf\u2019s best friend visited bf\u2019s parents house while we were there because it\u2019s now a halfway point, stepdad made a threesome reference. These are just a few examples off the top of my head that don\u2019t require much extra backstory, but I hope paint some kind of picture. There has never been a visit without at least one remark.
