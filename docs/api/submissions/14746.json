That means a lot of students come from low income families, juvenile detention centers or get kicked out of schools. \nI have this one student (18 f) who is very, how do I put this, boisterous? And could easily be considered a bully. From what I understand she left home and is essentially couch surfing with friends. So I don't know how secure her source of food might be outside of school. \nThat being said, the school provides breakfast, lunch and a few snacks a day to the students for free. They can get seconds, there is a school store that has snacks and drinks in it that they use reward currency to purchase, AND pretty much once a week students get to pick and take home free grocery type foods. Teachers have to pay for their lunches by the way. \nI bring lunches from home and honestly can never finish even half my lunch in the time I am given, especially considering I tend to have to make copies or take care of something. So by the time I sit down to eat, I have 15 minutes to try to eat. Because of this, I tend to eat some of my food after lunch, which just so happens to be the class that the student is in. \nPretty much every single day she is actually at school, she comes into my room extremely loudly then practically bullies me to give her some of my food. This is getting so frustrating to me because the students have so much food that is provided to them for free and here she is trying to get me to give up my lunch that I paid for with my hard earned money. Realistically, money I dont get enough of for the job I'm doing. \nI always respectfully tell her that I'm not giving her my food, I'm going to eat it,  and that she can go get a snack from the office. I also ask her if she ate lunch. Half the time she says no, which makes me MORE MAD because she is refusing the free food she is given to then be hungry and badger me about giving up my lunch. \nAnd along with that, She told me I should have snacks in my room but it's not like I'm flush with cash.

Look, I get it, I worked as a TA in a non-public school for 6 years and I got about 20 minutes for lunch, oftentimes less, if there was a student (or students) in crisis.  You have to prioritize YOU during your lunch break.  Eat a good breakfast every day, like oatmeal with fruit and nuts, or toast and eggs, that will give you the energy to make it to lunch without snacking.  \n\nGet to work ten minutes early in the morning, or stay ten minutes later in the afternoon to make copies or do those little tasks that you would normally do during your lunch.  \n\nEat your lunch in the teacher\u2019s lounge, your car, in another classroom, or lock your classroom door and pick a spot in your room that isn\u2019t facing windows to eat your lunch.

I can\u2019t imagine eating while I\u2019m supposed to be teaching. Editing to add that yes, I understand you don\u2019t have enough time to eat during your actual lunch. Maybe bring a protein shake or something along with about half the food you currently take.

I get that you're saying she has free food available to her from the school, and she can eat in class if she wants... but this problem would be eliminated if you were not eating your lunch in front of your students when you were supposed to be instructing the class. Maybe she doesn't like the free lunch. Maybe she just wants to control you and get under your skin any way she can. Maybe she really hates the free lunch option and hates that you have delicious (insert your lunch) and she has to watch you eat it in front of her and rub it in her face that she's food insecure every day.

You could try pushing back there, but we all know that just because something is illegal doesn't mean you won't get fired over it so no judgement if you don't feel comfortable doing so. And while it's unpleasant, you can leave her to jiggle and whine outside until class starts, at least...\n\nIt does make me wonder if she's not the one getting bullied though. It would explain why she's not eating lunch and is basically hiding in your classroom. I realize she's actually kinda bullying you to get _into_ the classroom, but you are safe for her to do that too. And her boisterous personality might make my suggestion feel like an impossibility, but sometimes people overcompensate to hide their vulnerability. Have you tried escorting her to lunch or the office to get a snack when she asks for her food? Her resistance to that might give you information to act on even though it will cost you lunch time.", "That's exactly what I'm thinking too.

When the bell rings I put my lunch box away but I will keep like a granola bar or something like that on my desk for a quick bite if I get to the point that I'm really hungry. I don't ever eat food during instructional time. I'm an art teacher and so the students have quite a bit of individual work time where I just will instruct them individually when needed. If no one is needing my attention, I will eat my granola bar or what have you. \nThe students are allowed to have snacks in my classroom too, so it's not like I am treating them differently than what I myself do. \nI also can't physically eat super fast.
