Parent here. Not sure what\u2019s going on in your area. Do you have a shortage of baby wipes? We get them online by the box load and never run out of them. Am I missing something?\n\nEdit: we use them too when we need to. They are nice. I can\u2019t blame anyone for using them when they have a need.\n\nEdit2: Generally we buy Kirkland brand wipes for ourselves separate from the baby wipes. Give those a try.", "NTA. I\u2019ve had a similar argument with someone. \nI use to buy baby wipes for my cat as she was recovering from severe obesity (she\u2019s back to being a healthy weight now) and asthma so, she couldn\u2019t clean herself and her medication often got all over her. Baby wipes were the only thing I could use to clean her because they were soft, wet and scent less. \nThe woman got mad at me because I wasn\u2019t a mother and they\u2019re labeled BABY. I then explained that baby wipes are also used for elderly and the sick too. She suggested I used cleaning wipes like Clorox or wet wipes (the ones for your hands).\n\nHonestly it\u2019s such a non issue. Some people are so absorbed in their own issues they cannot see that others use the product they seek out too \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f you have a health related issue and you found a product that works for you. Okay sure it\u2019s labeled for babies. Buts it\u2019s also far cheaper and it\u2019s not gendered like dude wipes (which are overpriced).", "Definitely NTA! \n\nFor the record, I had a baby at the beginning of the pandemic (she's now a toddler), and we've used a lot of wipes, and I've never heard of a wipe shortage. Formula, yes. Wipes? Nah. \n\nEven if there was a shortage, I think it's a legitimate need. It's not like you're buying it to just waste it on something silly.", "NTA Baby wipes aren't just for babies. Parents need to get over themselves thinking only they can use certain things.   \n\n\nAlso, new parents, if you are having trouble finding babywipes: You can find big packs on amazon for really cheap! We had to do it because my mom had to have a colostomy bag for a bit and it keep leaking, found you can find bulk baby wipes pretty cheap", "NTA. Anyone can buy baby wipes, not just parents. People buy them for homeless people, deployed soldiers, etc. Also you have a legit reason for buying them.  \nI'm confused though. I've bought baby wipes during the pandemic, and I never ran into any issues with availability. Even if there were a shortage on baby wipes, you genuinely didn't know.", "NTA. I\u2019m a parent myself and I\u2019ve never had trouble finding baby wipes or struggled to. Never heard of a baby wipe shortage too. That mom was probably just mad she couldn\u2019t give her advice to you and became angry because you\u2019re buying wipes targeted for \u201cbaby\u2019s\u201d but I know so many people who enjoy using baby wipes for themselves, I even use mine to clean or wipe off my makeup sometimes. \nOnce again, never heard of a baby wipe shortage LOL. Definitely a formula shortage though. \nJust make sure not to flush them!", "NTA. We aren't parents but we've always used sensitive baby wipes. Also have never seen a shortage in Maryland.", "NTA. There were wipes there and you bought one pack. The people who buy in bulk to either hoard or resell are the problem, not you", "NTA. There are plenty of wipes (source: I work at a walmart competitor). We run out of formula a lot, baby water has been damn near impossible to find, but wipes? Aisle's full to bursting all day, every day", "NTA. She needs to mind her own business. You have every right to buy what you need just like they do. This store woman is so damn nosy. Baby wipes are used for many purposes. It\u2019s not like you are buying baby formula just for the hell of it.", "NTA. I'm a parent with two kids in diapers. I had no problem buying wipes by the case throughout the pandemic. Now, if you were buying baby formula to manufacture drugs, then you'd definitely be TA.", "NTA. As a fellow IBS sufferer I feel your pain", "Ur not an asshole tbh. I\u2019m 20 and use wipes because it cleans me up better. They can go on Amazon if it\u2019s an issue or call a store ahead of time to see if they have specific wipes. Besides scented wipes aren\u2019t for babies. Wipes in general aren\u2019t only for babies. They\u2019re diluted", "NTA, what you do with your butt is no one elses business!! Wipe the shit away and feel great about it!", "NTA - Assuming you're not clearing the shelf entirely in order to stock up, if there's a shortage it's a supply chain issue, not a 'This butt is not sufficiently baby-eqsue' issue.\n\nAlso, people survived before disposable baby wipes were a thing.", "NTA for taking care of your asshole.", "NTA. Those cucumber melon wipes are nice.", "NTA your money, but what you want.\n\nSide note, have you considered getting a bidet attachment for your bathroom?

I have no problems with you buying baby wipes. Is there a shortage in your area or something? We were affected by thr formula shortage, and if you'd been buying that because you liked the taste I'd have a different opinion. But baby wipes?! Come on... Youre free to get whatever works best for you!\n\nEdit: Like others have said, they're widely available online if that mom is having troubles finding them. I've got an auto-order through Amazon.", "Nta buy them if you want/ need them, just don\u2019t flush them", "NTA\n\nThey are wipes that can be used for babies they not wipes that are exclusively for the use of babies.  If they are saying there is a shortage they arent looking hard enough as there are loads out there.\n\nIf they make you feel comfortable then you should carry on using them no matter what they say.", "NTA is any way. \nThey are just wipes. It's not like you bought baby formula which is actually having shortage. \n\nMothers can be pressed about it all they want but in the end of the day, it's just a product and you have ever right to buy it if you want to. They can't gatekeep a clean butt!", "NTA. The problem is with the supply chain and people hoarding, not you, a single man, buying baby wipes.", "NTA. I never fully appreciated the benefits and joys afforded by baby wipes until our Little Son joined our world 12+ years ago. I still keep them in each of our home\u2019s bathrooms and each of our cars. When I travel, I keep them in my travel pack.  I will use them until my dying day.", "NTA. \n\nYou are not buying in bulk and leaving others without - you said yourself the most you ever buy are multipacks of 2 or 3 because they save you money. If you were hoarding like dozens of packs at a time, that would be different.", "NTA but have you thought about getting a bidet bottle to reduce your environmental impact?", "NTA, everyone deserves a clean butthole.", "NTA\n\nI also buy fragrance-free baby wipes for myself. During the worst of the supply chain shortage issues when there were only very few on the shelves, I left them for the parents of babies. \n\nBut if there\u2019s plenty on the shelves? Go for it. This woman had no business commenting, and your sisters are being too hard on you.", "NTA. My parents buy at wholesale clubs and a box of baby wipes for all adult derrieres is always stocked at their house. Horde it? No. Do we as adults all use them, keep them in our bags for just-in-case, and generally enjoy feeling clean? Yes. \n\nAlso those cucumber melon ones are phenom. Wipes are out there, I have yet to see a shortage of them in the several stores I shop at, but that may just be this area I live in. The shortage here is in feminine care supplies!", "Baby wipes are terrible for the environment - in the UK we have a product call Wype.\n\nIt's a soothing gel that you use in toilet paper and it is so good for sensitive skin\n.and better for the environment.\n\nNTA", "NTA. I don't think you did anything wrong.", "Honestly question.  What do you do with the wipes after?\n\nI have a kid but also a diaper pail.  Do you just throw it into your bathroom trash bin?  Doesn't it make your bathroom smell like poop?", "NTA. I have 3 kids and I love having baby wipes on hand. They have many uses. I could not care less who buys them. Plenty of people have needs that wipes can help, or they just like using them sometimes. As long as you\u2019re not flushing them down the toilet, buy as many wipes as you need. It\u2019s not like you were hoarding up cans of formula.", "NTA. Why are these ladies trying to make you feel guilty?", "Wow! So now people think they have the right to tell others what they can/can't buy? You were too nice to that horrible woman. I would have smiled and grabbed all they had left, just to make her go crazy. LOL\n\nNTA", "NTA, I get the complaint of supplies being low. But its not like you were hording or preventing her from getting wipes. If stocks were low and you took the only package I might give you YTA. But production is up and there are supplies available.", "You\u2019re not TA or anything but can I gently suggest looking into a bidet? If you have IBS it will legitimately change your life. (Just ask my postpartum hemorrhoids.)", "NTA How and what you wipe your ass with is no one's business. Though... are you aware they make travel bidets? They're very handy to have.", "NTA- parent here. When those same mothers stop using baby wipes for everything under the sun (we all do it. Wipe the table, wipe the car console, wipe your shirt from dribble) they can then complain about people without kids using them for their intended purpose. Wiping butts.", "NTA. Baby wipes are amazing!  I have used them well beyond my children being small. I have several packs at home as they have more uses that just baby butt wiping. Buy what you want.", "NTA. you have adult money and you can use it how you want.", "NTA. But, buy a bidet. They are great", "NTA, it's a store, those are products, you buy whatever you want to buy.", "NTA. The same people who have an issue with you were the ones hoarding toilet paper 3 years ago. Best never to engage with anyone you see at that particular store.", "Nta, as you said they would restock in a day or so.", "NTA. I have NEVER had an issue finding baby wipes. I buy them by the case-full on a regular basis for my son. During this entire pandemic, I have never had a single issue with either baby wipes or diapers.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nLol, this one is a doozy.  How long will it stay up?\n\nIf you want to buy babywipes, buy wipes.  I have lots of kids, I've never had a shortage.  We buy a case of 12 on Amazon, and that lasts for a year or so.\n\nIf your turdblaster needs that much tender love, I sincerely suggest you look at getting a bidet installed.  You can do it for under a hundred bucks and it will give you a glistening starfish.", "NTA the shortage is due to people stock piling and reselling not picking up one pack. You are free to by whatever there is no law restricting only parents can purchase baby wipes. And whose to say you could just by a pack yo donate. Next time just say no thank you.", "NTA My son is 16 months old. Wipes are not a hard to get item and you are buying as needed. My family is still buying baby wipes years after my youngest sibling (16) has been out of diapers. They are useful. I keep a pack in the car in case of spills.", "NTA. Wet Wipes Aren\u2019t A Baby Specific Item. Adults Use Them All The Time.", "NTA - I buy baby wipes to clean off my exercise equipment when I am done using it. There is a baby wipe shortage? News to me. Last time I bought them, they were fully stocked.", "NTA\n\nI buy baby wipes as well.  Due to my cancer, I have IBS issues.\n\nThe Pampers wipes for sensitive skin are cheaper and don't make me break out, and have no scent.  So I buy them.  \n\nTHere is no reason to pay extra for fancy named wipes when the lower cost wipes I like do the job.", "Nta. As a mother to two kids, I have yet to ever not be able to buy them plus I use baby wipes even without having a baby. I keep some in my purse in fact", "NTA\n\nThere *has* been a shortage in some places, but that's because people are buying in bulk and hoarding wipes.\n\nAnd some childfree or childless people buy them for like... hand wipes, or for cleaning purposes. They don't have a need for them, and during a shortage, this would be rude/disrespectful.\n\nIf you have a need for the wipes, it's no one's business why you buy them.\n\nI don't think you did anything wrong here, and even if you *were* buying them without the need... it's not her place to chide you. She was being an AH.\n\nI don't think your relatives were being AHs either. If there's a shortage in your area, they have valid concerns. It doesn't sound like they were being insulting. And you *did* bring them into it.\n\nSo...\n\nNTA\n\nThough, if you'd like a suggestion. \"Thank you, but no,\" works fine. You didn't need to say who the wipes were for. Obviously you *can* say whatever you like, but less info might have avoided the whole thing.

This is about a lot more than baby wipes. I'll leave the rest of the original comment as it was so it's not confusing to read the thread.\n\n\\--------------------------------\n\nNot for buying baby wipes. But that's not the issue I found reading your post. It was that you feel victimised about all of this. The closest women in your life told you about this issue that has nothing to do with you and your response to that is to come crying to reddit. You weren't aware of the issue and how you respond to that knowledge now is your choice. You can keep buying them if you want. But it's just a weird response to have to seek validation of strangers when your sisters and mother didn't do anything wrong. Your attempt to disguise the actual issue is what makes you the asshole in this. You're not an asshole for buying baby wipes. You're an asshole for your entitled response to the situation. The woman in the store was an asshole too, but you'll probably never see her again. You should be more concerned with how you're unable to accept the concerns of your sisters and mother without victimising yourself over it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
