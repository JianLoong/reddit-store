Just like you don't have to invite anyone you don't want to your deal, no one has to invite you to their deals.  Expect not to be welcome at that cousin's home in the future.", "NTA - She'll put more work into banning you then skillfully engaging with her son. It's your wedding and since the parents cannot manage their toddler they are reaping what they've sow. Her threat is extreme. Enjoy your wedding.", "NTA. It\u2019s a single event that you don\u2019t want a child disrupting. It\u2019s not like you\u2019ve barred him from all family events. You know he will disrupt the wedding if you let him come. You know his parents won\u2019t do anything about it, so you will either have to deal with a continued disrupting or force another guest to deal with it. Your decision is common sense.", "NTA", "NTA. Stick to your rule, but know that you likely will be barred from parties at her house. It doesn\u2019t sound like that\u2019s a good (or possibly safe?) place for your daughter, so this may be no loss. Maybe host events at your house without inviting her, as long as you don\u2019t do it on the same day.", "NTA. It's your wedding. You get to decide who is on the guest list. His parents won't curb his behavior so why stress yourself out. Call your cousin on her bluff. Tell her you are fine with not attending events held at her house.", "I know full and well she is entitled she always has been, that\u2019s why all the functions are at her house. She has all control then.", "It\u2019s unfortunate because he is a sweet kid (generally) and it\u2019s not his fault his parents are fucking him up. When things are calm, he\u2019s a loving kid who likes to snuggle and read books, but he\u2019s spoiled rotten and that sweetness will end.", "The wedding venue I booked has security as it is, plus there will be more security because it\u2019s a wedding. So she will be turned away.", "I think maybe you misread the post?  Or I did?  I don't think she set an age limit at all, just decided not to invite the one bratty kid.  I agree with your vote, but I think she's doing exactly what you say she isn't doing.", "I do fully expect that. The reason they\u2019re hosted at her home is because she would pitch a fit if they weren\u2019t because then she can\u2019t control everything. I\u2019m not super close with that side of my family anyway, though I am close to my cousin by blood her husband. She is my cousin by marriage.", "My daughter is never out of my sight when we go to her house, when she was a baby after an alarming incident happened she was always strapped to me", "Can you host your own functions after you're married?  You might find a lot of your family will be glad for an alternative.", "I do not have a age limit.

You have my full support, which I realize probably isn't the deciding factor lol.", "[deleted]", "Thank you for it anyway. Wanna come to my wedding in her place?", "A 4 year old doesn't give a rats ass about going to a wedding.

I'll get my white dress out of storage. ;)", "Ah yes the classic \u201cwhy are you singling \u2018Bob\u2019 out?\u201d \n\nBecause \u2018Bob\u2019 is the only one who doesn\u2019t and apparently can\u2019t behave in a civilized manner for more than a minute.

Why invite a child that you know from past experiences will likely ruin it.", "Yeah, that\u2019s not a great place for any of you. Hardly a comfortable way to connect. I\u2019m sorry you are experiencing this mess.", "NTA. The parents shouldn\u2019t be invited either. \n\nMake sure to hire security", "It seems mean to specifically have a toddler on the no admittance list.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I understand the thought behind it and you don\u2019t want to spend all day breaking up fights and protecting your little one. \n\nI don\u2019t think your an ass, but there could be repercussions that ripple from this decision. I would say that not allowing him to come would be the last resort\u2026 but doesn\u2019t make you an AH", "NTA", "NTA\n\nAnd I'm just guessing that, a) she's of the \"kids will be kids\" school of not-parenting-at-all and b) having events at her home because otherwise nobody would invite that kid anywhere.", "NTA but this seems a stupid way to handle this. Just invite the family and assign someone in the wedding party to remove them if the child acts up.", "NTA\n\nIt's your wedding day. This isn't just a family barbecue or something.\n\nIf your cousin bothered to parent, she wouldn't be in this position. Her son would either be better-behaved or she could be trusted to step in and remove him if needed. This is on her. And her partner.", "NTA  It\u2019s your wedding so you get to decide who to invite. Also, given that you mention an incident involving him being inappropriate with your daughter, it\u2019s imperative you put her safety above all else.\nThe child in question is young enough that he is unlikely to ever remember not being invited to this wedding so it\u2019s not like it\u2019s hurting his feelings or sabotaging him emotionally. Your cousin can get a babysitter and for all the kid knows, mom and dad just have boring grownup plans.", "It\u2019s not the child being targeted. It\u2019s that the parents fail to appropriately control their child. You wouldn\u2019t let an unleashed dog run wild around a wedding, knocking over tables with cake and causing a disaster. Nor should you let a child cause this kind of chaos.", "All I was saying was that having the toddler be the only kiddo excluded should be plan c or d\u2026 not plan a.\n\nI agree that he should be supervised. Both for his safety and the enjoyment of everyone else at the wedding. \n\nSpeaking from a family with many entitled and dramatic members, her \u201cexcluding\u201d him from her wedding (it will probably be that wording from whoever brings it up) will persist in conversations at family functions and effect whatever relationship OP may have in the future with this kiddo.\n\nI\u2019ll say again, does not wanting him there make OP an AH? No\n\nAre there other options that could be explored before that? Probably.", "You have my support too!! And I admire your shiny spine. You might give your family some courage. \n\nNTA and congrats!", "Bet she would pitch a bigger fit if she knew that you invited an internet stranger, I mean a new friend in her place. Lol", "NTA and don't back down. This is your day and it makes sense that you would not want an unruly kid to ruin it. If your cousin wants her 4 year old son to attend then she has to teach him how to act in public. This is on her and her partner. If they actually cared about his behavior, this would not be a problem.", "NTA  They need to get control of their son.  Period!", "NTA, not your fault your cousins don\u2019t know how to discipline their children", "NTA\n\nThe person who is most affected by this is the 4 year old.  4 year olds can be hard work. Some can be more hard work than others... but this 4 year old has entitled parents who are doing nothing to help him learn appropriate behaviour... which may include removing or excluding him from some situations due to past behaviour.\n\nIt will be no loss to you and your future children if you are not in the presence of your cousin and his family.\n\nThis kids mother is going to find out the hard way that no one wants to spends time with her child.  His current behaviour can be somewhat excused away... but you can't use the same excuses when the kid is 10, 12, 15... and she may find him with a criminal record.\n\nBe prepared for them to show up with the kid regardless.  You may need security.  If you can't bar them from entering (because of your family) that security can be there to remove them if they don't discipline your child.\n\nOr just rescind the invitation that you've given to your cousin and his wife.", "If you have the budget and the venue has space you could hire childminding service for young kids. At least for ceremony and speaches etc \nNTA either way it's your wedding", "There was another post where someone allowed a relative to bring their child to the wedding (or maybe they just bright their uninvited child, I forget.) The child had a screaming meltdown over cake at the reception and the parent did not remove the child. This went on for about 40 minutes while the reception was at a standstill. The reception was ruined. The person was finally told to leave and then the parent had a fit about that. Total disaster. Yeah, never allow a poorly behaved child to attend *any* event that he/she could disrupt if they have the type of parent who will do nothing if the kid has a meltdown.\n\nAs for never being invited to your cousin's house again, that sounds like a win!", "Prepare for them to show up with the kid, anyway.", "NTA OP.", "NTA at all. I would not invite that child. But just a thought... if you want to avoid family drama and if you can afford it financially and if the venue allows it, and since there are so many children, you could have a special kids corner or something and hire one or two professional nannies to watch them and deal with tantrums and make sure not one of the other kids is bullied etc. That would fix the entire problem and it would make all the parents very happy.", "INFO \nHow long ago was it", "Nta", "We will ALL come in her place.  When and where, op? I can't promise a gift but I'd love to go and support you, AND I'll pay for my Plate.", "NTA. It\u2019s not your fault the parents are negligent to deal with there child, sounds like the people to blame you for throwing a wedding cause he had a freak out", "NTA\u2026", "Frankly everyone is to blame in the end there. It should never have been allowed to carry on so long. After a few minutes the parent should have been told to parent their child or leave. They were still at fault but it didn't have to get to the point of ruining the reception."]}
