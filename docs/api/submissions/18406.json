Expect not to be welcome at that cousin's home in the future.", "NTA - She'll put more work into banning you then skillfully engaging with her son. It's your wedding and since the parents cannot manage their toddler they are reaping what they've sow. Her threat is extreme. Enjoy your wedding.", "NTA. It\u2019s a single event that you don\u2019t want a child disrupting. It\u2019s not like you\u2019ve barred him from all family events. You know he will disrupt the wedding if you let him come. You know his parents won\u2019t do anything about it, so you will either have to deal with a continued disrupting or force another guest to deal with it. Your decision is common sense.", "NTA", "NTA. Stick to your rule, but know that you likely will be barred from parties at her house. It doesn\u2019t sound like that\u2019s a good (or possibly safe?) place for your daughter, so this may be no loss. Maybe host events at your house without inviting her, as long as you don\u2019t do it on the same day.", "NTA. It's your wedding. You get to decide who is on the guest list. His parents won't curb his behavior so why stress yourself out. Call your cousin on her bluff. Tell her you are fine with not attending events held at her house.", "I know full and well she is entitled she always has been, that\u2019s why all the functions are at her house. She has all control then.", "It\u2019s unfortunate because he is a sweet kid (generally) and it\u2019s not his fault his parents are fucking him up. When things are calm, he\u2019s a loving kid who likes to snuggle and read books, but he\u2019s spoiled rotten and that sweetness will end.", "The wedding venue I booked has security as it is, plus there will be more security because it\u2019s a wedding. So she will be turned away.", "I think maybe you misread the post?  Or I did?  I don't think she set an age limit at all, just decided not to invite the one bratty kid.  I agree with your vote, but I think she's doing exactly what you say she isn't doing.", "I do fully expect that. The reason they\u2019re hosted at her home is because she would pitch a fit if they weren\u2019t because then she can\u2019t control everything.

You might find a lot of your family will be glad for an alternative.", "I do not have a age limit. I am singling out this child because I know his behavior, and he will ruin my wedding.", "Sounds like you've thought it through.  You have my full support, which I realize probably isn't the deciding factor lol.", "[deleted]", "Thank you for it anyway.
