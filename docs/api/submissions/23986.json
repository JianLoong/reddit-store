It honestly sounds like your mom was the AH if anything. She shouldn't have posted something like that, which hurt all of her children's feelings. She could have posted a ranking where it said things like \"Who was the cutest child?\" \"Who was the most extroverted child?\" and other positive things like that.

Also, I second what others have said - I don't think you were the \"golden child\" in the sense of 'you always get given the best birthday gift and you could get away with murder'. I think you're the child who had all the expectations and a lot of the struggles.  The child who felt *pressured* to be good, to earn love and pride.\n\nI think maybe you were the Good Kid, and that's a hell of a thing to feel like you have to be. \n\nANYWAY, you have every right to feel hurt, and it's ridiculous of your parents to make such a big deal over you actually being hurt.  And there's no excuse for your dad to call you a bitch.\n\nDo you push back against them very often?

Y'know, these replies are absolutely confounding me. Y'all are saying that OP is a brat for... sticking up for herself and saying that her parents hurt her AND her siblings feelings? She clearly stated that she wasn't a brat as a kid and that's she's shocked that her PARENT PUBLICLY said that she was a bratty kid.

The comic has been doing a whole spiel on his family, after 15 minutes about talking about his older sibling, how he's the baby and how his parents treated the two of them differently, he looks up and says with a dramatic pause... Oh yeah we have a sister who's the middle child, but we don't talk about her.\n\nMy mother was rolling with laughter, tears were pouring down her eyes...

Golden child is the one who gets less demands, whose wants and schedules etc are respected and who the other siblings are expected to accommodate.

Don't rank your children. That's a very weird thing to do semi-publicly just for fun (I understand talking to your partner about one child being more difficult to manage etc., but then the goal is to get support or find a common strategy, not just for the lolz and likes).", "You\u2019re right. I said Boomers as well, but there are plenty of Gen Xers who lean into the same behaviours.", "You\u2019re right, I misread. But, generational trauma travels far yeah?", "They have a page about their counselors, psychologist & orher providers. Their Clinical Social Workers, Marriage an Family Therapists and Psychologist are all licensed\u2026 \n\nBesides that, I just wanted to put another perspectice out there.
