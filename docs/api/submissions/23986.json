They weren't made to get good grades and weren't held to the same rigid standards as I was.\n\nAnyway, I was looking at Facebook yesterday when I saw a post that my mom (47f) made. It was one of those \"rank your kids\" posts that were making the rounds around her friend group. The ranks that I would like to mention were like \"which of your kids was the most emotional? Who overreacts the most? Who's the most whiny? The most exhausting to look after?\" And my mom listed me first for ALL of those and more. \n\nI know it's not much of a big deal, it's just a silly ranking game but FUCK it hurt my feelings. I confronted my mom and said that she shouldn't have done that list at all, cause it hurt ALL of our feelings. I told her that I didn't understand, I absolutely broke my back as a kid to make them happy. My dad stepped in and dismissed me, saying that it wasn't a big deal and I was overreacting. \n\nSo since yesterday everytime they talk to me I act like a snotty five year old.

Instead of being an adult about the situation I acted like a bratty child and refused to obey my parents, especially my dad.

And I hate to break it to you. You\u2019re definitely not the golden child. The golden child doesn\u2019t have to work for their parents love, they get it even with major fuck ups. You\u2019re the scapegoat more likely. You\u2019d be best to make a plan to get out of there asap.", "Tot dad called you a bitch? Yikes. Nta your parents are abusive.\n\nPost your own post about how they treat you.\n\nSecretly tape your father calling you a bitch and pay it online.", "**NTA**. It honestly sounds like your mom was the AH if anything. She shouldn't have posted something like that, which hurt all of her children's feelings. She could have posted a ranking where it said things like \"Who was the cutest child?\" \"Who was the most extroverted child?\" and other positive things like that. But ranking your children in negative categories like this is just weird and hurtful.", "NTA\n\nBut you need to get out of there as soon as you can.", "NTA your parents suck", "Not the asshole, man, boomers really don\u2019t know how to navigate social media or feelings. \n\nMaybe flip the table and ask your mom if she would like it if you publicly filled out a \u201crank your parents\u201d survey that aired out all of their parental flaws. \n\nNot saying to ask her in a cruel way to make her feel as bad as she made you feel, but, ask her from a place of compassion that might help her understand why you\u2019re upset", "NTA, absolutely. Also, I second what others have said - I don't think you were the \"golden child\" in the sense of 'you always get given the best birthday gift and you could get away with murder'. I think you're the child who had all the expectations and a lot of the struggles.  The child who felt *pressured* to be good, to earn love and pride.\n\nI think maybe you were the Good Kid, and that's a hell of a thing to feel like you have to be. \n\nANYWAY, you have every right to feel hurt, and it's ridiculous of your parents to make such a big deal over you actually being hurt.  And there's no excuse for your dad to call you a bitch.\n\nDo you push back against them very often? It kind of reminds me of when the Good Kid actually starts pushing back a big and not just accepting everything in fear of rocking the boat.", "YTA. You sound more like 12 than 22 here.", "What you described is not golden child\n\nAnd being petty l, purposefully bratty makes you an AH now for sure.  Do you even want a relationship with them? Doesn\u2019t sound like it", "People may disagree with me, but I think ESH but your parents win the AH competition. \n\nYour mom's post is insensitive, rude, disrespectful, hurtful, cruel, and flat out idiot. Your dad's response equates to \"oh god, another woman being emotional.\" They sound like they have some growing up to do and need to figure out how to tap into their empathy. Hopefully this is a rare occurrence from them.", "I'm between NTA and ESH. Being gaslighted like that by your parents it's a blow. But to prove her point right will only spark more fire rather than get you an apology. I'm happy to not have FB anymore but thank goodness my mom never got it in the first place.", "ESH\n\nStupid post by her, but your reaction, particularly once she deleted it, confirmed her post.", "YTA, your mum was right, you're still a whining brat.... grow up!!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Y'know, these replies are absolutely confounding me. Y'all are saying that OP is a brat for... sticking up for herself and saying that her parents hurt her AND her siblings feelings? She clearly stated that she wasn't a brat as a kid and that's she's shocked that her PARENT PUBLICLY said that she was a bratty kid. She only did that stuff after her dad dismissed her after she said that they hurt her feelings. \"ESH, YTA\"- Idc if y'all downvote me, y'all AND OP's parents need to \"grow up\" lmao.", "These Y.T.A responses are most likely from horrible parents that treat their kids the same way.
