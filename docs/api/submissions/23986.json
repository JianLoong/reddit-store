I struggled to get good grades, join a ton of clubs, do my chores perfectly, have good manners, etc. ANYTHING for my parents approval.

In contrast, my older (23m) and younger brother (19m) were a little different. They were both pretty big troublemakers as kids lol. They weren't made to get good grades and weren't held to the same rigid standards as I was.\n\nAnyway, I was looking at Facebook yesterday when I saw a post that my mom (47f) made. It was one of those \"rank your kids\" posts that were making the rounds around her friend group. The ranks that I would like to mention were like \"which of your kids was the most emotional? Who overreacts the most? Who's the most whiny? The most exhausting to look after?\" And my mom listed me first for ALL of those and more. \n\nI know it's not much of a big deal, it's just a silly ranking game but FUCK it hurt my feelings. I confronted my mom and said that she shouldn't have done that list at all, cause it hurt ALL of our feelings. I told her that I didn't understand, I absolutely broke my back as a kid to make them happy. My dad stepped in and dismissed me, saying that it wasn't a big deal and I was overreacting. \n\nSo since yesterday everytime they talk to me I act like a snotty five year old. Example: My dad asked me to fetch something for him and I folded my arms and said \"Nope. Don't want to\". When he got mad and demanded what had gotten into me I said \"well, I'm the most whiny child apparently, so now I have to make up for lost time\". I've made such a fuss over it that my mom has deleted the post and my dad called me a bitch and is now avoiding me. AITA?\n\nEdit: I appreciate the feedback that I've gotten, I totally thought that I was \"the golden child\", but my idea of it was WAY off lmao. And since people keep pointing it out, I do not live with my parents and I'm working two jobs and going to college. Though the comments that say that I'm \"proving her point\" hurt. I can't express enough how much I put my emotions aside as a kid in order to not bug my parents as a kid.

But if you ask my mom she is so glad that I calmed my anger down because \u201cshe knows I really struggled with it the most when I was younger\u201d \n\nI swear no matter how perfect we try to be women will always be seen as more emotional even by other women it\u2019s fucking gross. \n\nI\u2019m so so sorry OP.", "NTA. I'd be p'd if I was compared to my siblings like that and be made.out.to be the difficult whiny child!! And I think I'd definitely do the same and don my F U cap for a while at least just to show them how hurt I was by this!! \nRef the \"golden child\" comments, yeah I'm sorry to say it sounds like you were far from it. My OH is the golden boy in his family (5 siblings, 3 sisters and 1 twin brother) and he has always been the golden boy because he could be a total AH and the sun would still shine out of his backside in his mother's eyes!", "Hehehehe i like this post", "NTA  Read up on what the Golden Child and the Scapegoat are in a narcissistic family.  It will help you to realize that you were not the GC, you were and still are the Scapegoat.  Hopefully, this will help you to stop trying to win your parents' approval, as you are never going to succeed.  You are, undoubtedly, a good person and need to distance yourself emotionally from your toxic family.", "NTA incredibly fucked up thing for her to do but also I hope you can get to a therapist about this", "NTA, and you\u2019re not \u201cproving their point\u201d as some people are saying. What? If someone calls you whiny, you automatically can\u2019t have an issue with it or you\u2019re being whiny? Screw that. That\u2019s one of those things people like to do to say, \u201cgotcha\u201d, when it\u2019s complete nonsense.\n\nCut them off for a bit so they take notice and change their behavior.", "NTA. And definetly not the GC. I was the black sheep. And always treated like I was the worst of the bunch and expected to achieve the least out of my siblings.\nThe GC is the one who is completely spoiled and behaves the most like momma dearest and seems to get the absolute most amount of connection and time", "Sow the wind, reap the storm.  \n\nWhat kind of boomer brainrot does it take to play a game where you *rank* your kids, *in public*?", "NTA. I would deFOO the fuck out of those people.", "NTA\n\nSpeaking as a gifted child who had to fit that rigid standard that my two other siblings never had to meet..... find a therapist and talk about it. It's difficult because you want their love and aproval...but a lot of that is conditional and when it clicks you'll understand and need to talk. Your parent should've known that would hurt your feelings and not have posted it. I'm sorry that you're dealing with that.", "This is crazy! One of my children recently asked who was the favorite child and I told her there is no way I could answer that, each of my children are different and wonderful in their own way. I said it would be like me asking who your favorite pet, sibling, or parent is. She then proceeded to lay out her favorites with absolutely zero compunction.

You were a literal CHILD. They owed you everything in terms of love, support, kindness, compassion, etc. Instead, you were stuck supporting *them* emotionally while stifling your own feelings. \n\nYou're owning your feelings now and establishing some boundaries, and I am SO PROUD of you for that. It's hard. It's painful. And it's *work*. But you're doing it and prioritizing your own needs.\n\nAnd you're NTA for that.\n\nAlso want to add that your dad calling you a \"bitch\" is horrifying.", "damn. if my mother pulled something like that no one would ever hear the end of it. taking a post down is the bare minimum. keep at it until she\u2019s in tears. then continue to bring it up every so often.", "You seem to be proving her opinions right by your actions since to be fair.\nNot sure why any parent would post anything about their kids like that though.", "INFO - **I've been on FB over a decade and haven't seen a rank-your-kids post.** \n\nCurious how often others see them.  Is this really a thing?", "I'm convinced this sub is full of people who don't actually want to give divorced insight into whether or not someone was in the wrong. They just read some inflammatory statement and think \"well if *I* were in that situation, my feelings would've been hurt,\" and parrot whatever braindead, virtue-signaling talking point will get them the most upvotes all while playing at smartphone therapist.", "Nta.  If you look at it logically.  Busy kids are a lot of work.   If your brothers didn\u2019t do anything they were pretty easy.    You were into everything being everybody\u2019s friends they had a lot more to worry about.   Were are you hanging out with the wrong crowd?   Were you with too many boys?   are you gonna be able to get your studying done?   Are you making commitments you can\u2019t keep?

Abuela finally realises that magic isn't the only talent that matters, and Mirabel has expanded her role in the community from housekeeper (to whom casita responds exceptionally well) and child minder to a fully realised leader, much like abuela is.", "Yeah.  I\u2019m 47 and would NEVER do anything like this, I actually just got in a fight with my very boomer MIL because she won\u2019t stop ranking the grandkids on everything- cutest, most beautiful, most empathetic, smartest.  The grandkids are 2 and 13, even if you thought it was a great idea to be so clueless and callous, there is literally no way for anyone to accurately compare any of this. That\u2019s boomer-think and boomer behavior, and I\u2019d think the same if someone my age was doing the same thing.", "I and the majority of people here are not seeing this claim of them declaring themselves superior. They thought they were the \u201cgolden child\u201d and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. The parents were both pricks, so they deserve what they\u2019re getting.
