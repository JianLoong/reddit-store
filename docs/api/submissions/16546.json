I am an aspiring writer and Sasha is a published one. We met at university, I did creative writing and she did modern languages.\nI find it difficult to motivate myself and write consistently. Sasha on the other hand finds it super easy. She can write a book after a book (she writes romance so it doesn't really count, does it). She's having her novel traditionally published next year but she has several ones she's self-published already. Admittedly, I didn't think she made much money with them because she still lives in her old 3 bed flat, dresses in the same band t-shirts and jeans she always did, uses bike, etc.. Nothing about her lifestyle screams success.\n\nI admit, I've always been slightly jealous of her writing speed and hate that motivation and consistency comes naturally to her but I was able to get over it because I understood that her speed didn't equate to success. \n\nI complained to her recently how difficult it is for me to write at home and she suggested that I could come over to her house and we do a writing session together, perhaps' it'll help me with motivation.\nHer office has a table that she set up for me to work at while she worked at her desk. I sat in front of my laptop for 45 minutes browsing Internet as she typing furiously. I asked her if she's working on her book and she dismissed me with a wave of a hand. I gritted my teeth as it was incredibly dismissive but I didn\u2019t say anything. I wrote about 50 words and got stuck on a sentence. I asked her a grammar question and she told me 'let it go, you can fix it later,' which again was dismissive. That sentence was bugging me and I couldn't write anymore. I closed my laptop and said I needed a break.\nShe sighed loudly. I asked her for coffee. I could tell she was frustrated but she went to make it. \n\nSearching for inspiration, I wandered around her office when I stumbled upon her bank statement (documents on her desk). I wanted to look away but couldn\u2019t when my eyes landed on the number. It was an account she used to receive payments from her self-published books. It was a lot. Her total was in 7 digits. I was speechless.\n\nWhen she came back, I asked her about it and she told me she couldn\u2019t believe I went snooping around and that she trusted me.\n\nI told her I didn\u2019t believe she made over a million with her books and how unfair it was as she was a shit writer that produced nothing by garbage. I didn\u2019t mean for it to be said out loud. She was furious. She called me a jealous cunt and that\u2019s why she didn\u2019t tell me and she told me to leave.\n\nI tried to apologise but she told me she needed time to think of what I said.\n\nSee, I think her writing is bad, but she\u2019s my friend, I never wanted for her to find that out.\n\nMy husband think I was the asshole for saying it and should apologise but my other friend told me I was right and only spoke the truth and Sasha should be the one apologising.\n\nWas I the asshole for telling the truth?", "created_utc": 1683395415, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/139wxqb/aita_for_telling_my_friend_what_i_really_think/", "score": 95, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think you came off a bit jealous and bitter.\n\n\n\nHer books are *selling* so people obviously enjoy them!

I just want to address this: \"I asked her a grammar question and she told me 'let it go, you can fix it later,' which again was dismissive.\" This is why your friend writes and you don't. She gets her thoughts on paper and saves fixing the grammar for the second draft.", "YTA. You have a green monster on your shoulder. Sasha seems like a great friend who wants to help you with your writing. Although you might not like her books, it seems like many other people do.", "YTA. You dismiss her genre of choice for not being \"real\" writing, which is why you think of it as garbage. Meanwhile, you can barely string a sentence together. You're very obviously jealous, more than slightly, that writing comes naturally to her, she has a better work ethic and attitude than you, and she STILL took time out of her day to help you be better.", "YTA.\n\nEverything you say drips with jealously and envy. \n\n>She can write a book after a book (she writes romance so it doesn't really count, does it).\n\nIt does. People like romance books. Maybe you don't. Personally it's not my cup of tea either. But a *lot* of people write romance books. You say it like it's somehow not real work because it's not a genre you personally like. But stuff like this just shoes that you've allowed your jealousy to morph into full on contempt.\n\nShe didn't try and brag or rub it in your face, in fact, She tried to help you! You are the one that went snooping, then got mad about what you found.\n\nShe was nice enough to offer to help you out by setting up a writing session. I don't read her as being dismissive at all. Writing takes brain power, she was probably in the middle of thinking. As for the grammar question, that was genuinely good advice. If you're getting caught up on grammar in your first draft, you'll never write anything at all. You gotta let it go, move on, and fix it later. Her telling you to move on wasn't dismissive, it was good advice. That's why it's her job, and it's just your hobby. \n\nYou may not like her writing style, but that doesn't mean others don't. I mean, she's gotten stuff published, and people are clearly purchasing it. People don't get paid well for shit books. \n\nYou called her a shit writer that produces nothing but garbage. Well...I don't mean to be harsh but...at least she's making *something*. You got stuck after typing 50 words. \n\nComparison is the thief of joy. Your jealously has turned into full on contempt for your friend.\n\nThe thing is though, idk how much I believe this post at all. Idk, I refuse to believe there's a human being who could write all this out and genuinely think they could possibly be in the right. I've read AH posts on here before, and they usually at least phrase things like they think they were genuinely in the right. I don't see that here. This post is written like somebody who *wants* to get a 'YTA' response", "Every part of your post screams AH! \n\n>(she writes romance so it doesn't really count, does it)\n\nYes, it does count.\n\n>Admittedly, I didn't think she made much money with them because she still lives in her old 3 bed flat, dresses in the same band t-shirts and jeans she always did, uses bike, etc.. Nothing about her lifestyle screams success.\n\nNot changing who you are as a person when you have money isn't an indication of anything. Some of the richest people I know don't dress up for day to day. \n\n>but I was able to get over it because I understood that her speed didn't equate to success. \n\nWell, you can get right back under it now, can't you? A lovely excuse for being jealous.. lucky you! She's talented, speedy and rich. Sucks for you. \n\n>I complained to her recently how difficult it is for me to write at home and she suggested that I could come over to her house and we do a writing session together, perhaps' it'll help me with motivation.

I asked her a grammar question and she told me 'let it go, you can fix it later,' which again was dismissive. \n\nShe was probably right. Letting yourself get entirely bogged down by a sentence is probably one of the reasons you're slow at writing. So, not dismissive, just good advice from the person you were repeatedly distracting from her work.\n\n>I asked her for coffee. I could tell she was frustrated but she went to make it. \n\nAgain, I say saint. \n\n>I wandered around her office when I stumbled upon her bank statement (documents on her desk).\n\nAH. \n\n>I told her I didn\u2019t believe she made over a million with her books and how unfair it was as she was a shit writer that produced nothing by garbage.\n\nYou are a terrible friend.\n\n>but my other friend told me I was right and only spoke the truth and Sasha should be the one apologising.\n\nYour other friend is either an AH too, or only hears your side of it and is trying to make you happy.

Wow, such a great friend... \"hey, I dont mind your success because at least you dont make a good living on it\"\n\nBasically your post boils down to this: You have an over inflated ego and think you are a superior writer, even though you literally can't get anything written.

This is laughably ridiculous, it took me less than 60 seconds to google \"best selling book genre\" and, surprise, surprise, it's romance! I had a feeling that was the case but wanted to make sure before posting. So, I guess your opinion differs somewhat to the millions of people who enjoy that genre.\n\nSecond, you really do come across as a bit of a snob when you mention the fact that she lives in a 3 bedroomed flat and still wears the same old band t-shirts etc. Some of the wealthiest people I've ever know dress the same as me, band t-shirts, jeans, so that doesn't mean shit when it comes to what they have in the bank. I'm far from wealthy btw.\n\nFinally, your bullshit about not wanting to look when you saw her bank statement is exactly that, it's bullshit. You were snooping into her finances which is just a massive breach of her privacy. Do you peer over your friends shoulders when they're at a cash machine? No, because it's fucking rude and none of your business. You then thought it was a good idea to bring it up with her which was just plain daft. What did you think was going to happen? Were you expecting her to give you some if the money she's obviously worked hard to earn?\n\nYTA 100%.\n\nETA : I haven't addressed you calling her a shitty writer simply because you already know that it was a nasty thing to do, no need to labour that point really.", "YTA.

I am an aspiring writer and Sasha is a published one. We met at university, I did creative writing and she did modern languages.\nI find it difficult to motivate myself and write consistently. Sasha on the other hand finds it super easy. She can write a book after a book (she writes romance so it doesn't really count, does it). She's having her novel traditionally published next year but she has several ones she's self-published already. Admittedly, I didn't think she made much money with them because she still lives in her old 3 bed flat, dresses in the same band t-shirts and jeans she always did, uses bike, etc.. Nothing about her lifestyle screams success.\n\nI admit, I've always been slightly jealous of her writing speed and hate that motivation and consistency comes naturally to her but I was able to get over it because I understood that her speed didn't equate to success. \n\nI complained to her recently how difficult it is for me to write at home and she suggested that I could come over to her house and we do a writing session together, perhaps' it'll help me with motivation.\nHer office has a table that she set up for me to work at while she worked at her desk. I sat in front of my laptop for 45 minutes browsing Internet as she typing furiously. I asked her if she's working on her book and she dismissed me with a wave of a hand. I gritted my teeth as it was incredibly dismissive but I didn\u2019t say anything. I wrote about 50 words and got stuck on a sentence. I asked her a grammar question and she told me 'let it go, you can fix it later,' which again was dismissive. That sentence was bugging me and I couldn't write anymore. I closed my laptop and said I needed a break.\nShe sighed loudly. I asked her for coffee. I could tell she was frustrated but she went to make it. \n\nSearching for inspiration, I wandered around her office when I stumbled upon her bank statement (documents on her desk). I wanted to look away but couldn\u2019t when my eyes landed on the number. It was an account she used to receive payments from her self-published books. It was a lot. Her total was in 7 digits. I was speechless.\n\nWhen she came back, I asked her about it and she told me she couldn\u2019t believe I went snooping around and that she trusted me.\n\nI told her I didn\u2019t believe she made over a million with her books and how unfair it was as she was a shit writer that produced nothing by garbage. I didn\u2019t mean for it to be said out loud. She was furious. She called me a jealous cunt and that\u2019s why she didn\u2019t tell me and she told me to leave.\n\nI tried to apologise but she told me she needed time to think of what I said.\n\nSee, I think her writing is bad, but she\u2019s my friend, I never wanted for her to find that out.\n\nMy husband think I was the asshole for saying it and should apologise but my other friend told me I was right and only spoke the truth and Sasha should be the one apologising.\n\nWas I the asshole for telling the truth?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I buy their books and share their writing pieces to show my support and sing their praises to anyone who will listen, even when their chosen genre doesn't resonate me. Do you know why? Because that's what friends do for one another.

And you are so envious of her.\n\nIt doesn't matter you did creative languages while she did modern languages. I know writers with physics degrees, who worked in heavy industry, or who are first line responders. Doing a degree in a creative subject doesn' t make you automatically able to create works of value. Or able to judge except it does not match x, y, z standard rules. You can write most perfectly crafted book but no one will care, read or buy unless the characters mean something to them and/or plot engages. Lot of cookie cutter books out there. \n\nYou also disagree with her writing style. She seems to be a pantser while you are not. Write while the inspiration hits then edit, edit, edit. And she's wealthy enough to pay others to edit or her publishing company will help her. On one hand, lot of work at the back end, on the other hand you are not able to finish your WIP. I sympathise same here. But that is on us. And you're a literary snob. Nothinv wrong with romance. Millions read it, it provides enjoyment, and a book within the gebre has potential to have same lasting power as any other genre novel.\n\nFinally, she tried to help you and you repaid her by snooping.

Good for your friend that she can write quickly and is successful. That doesn't mean she doesn't have her own struggles with writing.\n\nAlso... as a writer yourself, don't you know that romance is one of the most lucrative genres to publish in? Unfortunately many people look down on romance writers (partially due to misogyny). Even so, you are allowed to dislike romance and/or Sasha's writing style.

So let me see if I'm correct. \n\nYou claim to be a writer but can't actually sit down and write anything. Your friend sees you are struggling, and kindly suggest maybe you write with her and her process/environment might help. Instead, you keep interrupting her writing process because, again, yours isn't working, and since you can't work, it's OK to interrupt her. You have ALL people should be aware of how important it is to be able to get the thoughts down as quickly as possible before the inspiration/thought is gone. She wasn't dismissing you. She was in her writing zone, and you kept interrupting  and dismissing her.\n\nThen, after she invited you into her space, you snoop through her stuff?? This is a huge invasion of privacy and trust. Then, if that horrible breach of trust wasn't enough, you then insult her and her writing in her home, and somehow think, she owes you an apology??? She did nothing to you, she didn't flaunt her success in your face, she treated you the same, as an equal writing partner, she tried to help you, and you dismissed her and insulted her. \n\nOn top of that, there's your complete attitude of condescension. I genuinely dislike people like who are gatekeepers of art and dismissive of other genres like romance or fantasy. Just because it is not or style doesn't mean it doesn't have quality or merit. I'm so tired of writers and people who think everyone should be the next Hemingway or Tolstoy for the work to have merit. Saying these like \"its romance so it doesn't count\" is infuriating and hurtful. She spent time and worked on it, and you just dismissed her, you giant AH. It doesn't have to be greatness, but she wrote something and people enjoyed it, people engaged with it and that matters and it just as important.\n\nHaving read this entire  AITA post from you, I don't know if you have the right to judge anyone for their writing. You really aren't the authority on bad writing. You just wrote an entire first person narrative about how you are owed an apology and wrote yourself as the antagonist. How when you typed this up did you not notice you were the villain. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nYou didn't tell her the truth,  you told her you truth which is baised and only you own, it seems that there are plenty of people in the world who thinks your friend is a good writer. \n\nI hope your friend drops you like a bad habit, she doesn't need your negativity and judgment bringing her down, and she will always have to be on her guard because you are not a true friend. A true friend is happy for their friends' success. I wish her nothing but good things, and more books.

Sasha is right and is able to achieve flow because her habits are effective; she stays directly engaged with her writing during work sessions, minimizes distractions, and understands the importance of a multi-draft editing process.\n\nYou, on the other hand, fall down research-holes (a perennial delay tactic, because we can always tell ourselves that we need to do more reading before we write); you obsess over her engagement and try to disrupt her flow by asking plaintive and pointless attention-begging questions while you are *a guest in her place of work*; and you feel the need to produce a Perfect First Draft, meaning you get stuck 50 words in rather than making a note to come back later and rolling onwards.\n\n(I teach writing.)", "YTA.

If for some reason this is actually real, perhaps you need to ask yourself why you think everyone's vision of success should look just like yours? To me, it sounds like she feels incredibly secure and free to be herself. She has nothing to prove to anyone, hell she even kept her success a secret from you. I hope one day you understand how much that says about you as a person. Does she need to drive an expensive car and wear designer clothing? Have a Mcmansion? A three bedroom unit is a great sized place for a single person or a couple. Do you not understand what money pits are? I bet she has a fantastic rent rate, why move and pay more just so others will say \"wow they must be SOOOOO rich\". What a pathetic attitude. Also, have you never seen how celebrities dress outside of work? It's a common joke that they look homeless but with expensive scarves. You sound like an absolute joke who needs to do a lot of reflection on why you are so critical of others. Oh and just to give you a taste of your own medicine; you probably can't write for shit. I don't see you ever being successful either. I would literally put money on that. Maybe stop fucking around online and getting hung up on insignificant lines. You can try and bash her genre all you want but, clearly she is doing something right. She literally gave you some wonderful advice too. Writing is first and foremost about just getting it out of your head and down on \"paper\". From there, you then go back and basically rewrite everything. It's basically sculpting with words. The fact that you can't understand the writing process again says a lot about you as a writer.

I am an aspiring writer and Sasha is a published one.\n\nNo such thing. You mean \"author\". You're an aspiring author, and she's a published one. If you write, you're a writer. Though, maybe you don't write.\n\n>We met at university, I did creative writing and she did modern languages.\n\nThis is a comma splice. This isn't how sentences work.\n\n>I find it difficult to motivate myself and write consistently. Sasha on the other hand finds it super easy. She can write ~~a~~ book after ~~a~~ book (she writes romance so it doesn't really count, does it).\n\nThis is a common phrase you're using wrong. Your punctuation is also a mess in this part.\n\n>She's having her novel traditionally published next year but she has several ones she's self-published already. Admittedly, I didn't think she made much money with them because she still lives in her old 3 bed flat, dresses in the same band t-shirts and jeans she always did, uses bike, etc.. Nothing about her lifestyle screams success.\n\nThis part is just a mess. \"Uses bike\" sounds super weird. Also, you're incredibly finanicially illiterate and you should work on that.\n\n>I admit, I've always been slightly jealous of her writing speed and hate that motivation and consistency comes naturally to her but I was able to get over it because I understood that her speed didn't equate to success.\n\nNo, hon, that's called working. You should try it.\n\n>I complained to her recently how difficult it is for me to write at home and she suggested that I could come over to her house and we do a writing session together, perhaps' it'll help me with motivation.\n\nComma splice, and why are you trying to make \"perhaps\" a possessive here?\n\n>Her office has a table that she set up for me to work at while she worked at her desk. I sat in front of my laptop for 45 minutes browsing Internet as she typing furiously.\n\nWorking and your tense is wrong. \"She typed\". \"Browsing Internet\" is also not something people say.\n\n>I asked her if she's working on her book and she dismissed me with a wave of a hand. I gritted my teeth as it was incredibly dismissive but I didn\u2019t say anything. I wrote about 50 words and got stuck on a sentence.\n\nThis is why she's written books and you haven't.\n\n>I asked her a grammar question and she told me 'let it go, you can fix it later,' which again was dismissive. That sentence was bugging me and I couldn't write anymore.\n\nWas it? That's surprising, considering your grammar here. Your dialogue is improperly formatted and you have more comma splices. It should be: She told me, \"Let it go. You can fix it later.\"\n\n>I closed my laptop and said I needed a break.\n\nFROM WHAT?\n\n>She sighed loudly. I asked her for coffee. I could tell she was frustrated but she went to make it.\n\nThis is really weak description by the way. If this was a story, I'd suggest something like, \"She huffed. I asked her for coffee. She looked frustrated, but went to make it.\"\n\n>Searching for inspiration, I wandered around her office when I stumbled upon her bank statement (documents on her desk).\n\nMore sentence fragments. And what \"inspiration\" would you be finding on her desk? Something to copy?\n\n>I wanted to look away but couldn\u2019t when my eyes landed on the number.\n\nNo, you didn't.\n\n>It was an account she used to receive payments from her self-published books. It was a lot. Her total was in 7 digits. I was speechless.\n\nOne, this isn't particularly believable. You couldn't just see that information from a quick glance. So either you're lying, or you snooped for a while. Two, \"her total was in 7 digits\" is not a thing human beings say.\n\n>When she came back, I asked her about it and she told me she couldn\u2019t believe I went snooping around and that she trusted me.I told her I didn\u2019t believe she made over a million with her books and how unfair it was as she was a shit writer that produced nothing by garbage. I didn\u2019t mean for it to be said out loud.\n\nHahahahaha yes you did.\n\n>She was furious. She called me a jealous cunt and that\u2019s why she didn\u2019t tell me and she told me to leave.\n\nGood for her.\n\n>I tried to apologise but she told me she needed time to think of what I said.\n\nThink ABOUT what you said. \"Think of what I said\" is incredibly awkward and not something humans say.\n\n>See, I think her writing is bad, but she\u2019s my friend, I never wanted for her to find that out.\n\nAnother comma splice. And hypocritical!\n\n>My husband think I was the asshole for saying it and should apologise but my other friend told me I was right and only spoke the truth and Sasha should be the one apologising. Was I the asshole for telling the truth?\n\nIs \"my other friend\" code for \"myself\"? Even your husband is calling you out.
