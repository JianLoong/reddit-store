She said it so casually, as if was just a small, insignificant part of her life she forgot to tell me about.

And I also wondered about this baby she had given up, what were they like? Did they ever wonder about their biological mom?\n\nAnyways, after the weekend at her parents, I told her I needed some space to think and process the situation. I told her I was staying at my sister's for a little while. She was very hurt by me saying that I didn't know if I knew who she was anymore and I explained to her that I was hurt by her keeping this from me, and now we're both just hurting each other. I don't know, did I overreact?\n\nEdit: I want to reiterate, the reaction my fiance had to me bringing this up seemed very defensive, I don't know for certain but I think she might still have some sort of emotional distress relating to this period in her life. I feel like I was the asshole because I left her alone to process this instead of staying by her side.

She likely has shame over that and is trying to hide it from herself more than anything, but its still something she should have brought up before accepting a proposal. It is a trust thing, as what else might she not have told you. And yes, there are things you need to consider with this new info.\n\nTake your time, and dont let her play victim to how she treated you.", "SHEESH. \n\nThat is HEAVY. \n\nNTA - \n\nIf you've gotten to the point of considering marriage, communication should be on a lock, and you two should know pretty much MOST of the important/significant things AND baggage about one another. \n\nI sympathize a great deal with your fianc\u00e9, I have to imagine this is a VERY hard thing to share with someone, ***BUT*** if she was going to share it with someone, that someone should\u2019ve been you (at least by now, with marriage on the table.)\n\nMake sure to keep communicating about this.", "NTA. The fact that her family was  comfortable enough to crack out the photo albums and breeze over that part of her life while still having it immortalized is telling. They have all accepted what occurred and probably assumed she had mentioned it to you because it\u2019s doubtful they would have showed you anything that could contribute to the state of things as they are now. And her reaction reinforced this. It\u2019s so far removed in her past that she doesn\u2019t understand your conflicting emotions. What she\u2019s missing is that this could very well be something that could come back to her years down the road in the form of an adult seeking out their biological mother all while you have built a life and a and family together. Surly that could stand to be quite messy years down the road. Is it a dealbreaker? Yet to be determined. But definitely not the a/h for questioning how the state of the relationship.", "NTA, that\u2019s a pretty intense revelation to discover after getting engaged & planning your lives together. There\u2019s no way that a rational person just \u201cforgets\u201d they had a baby one time. She is either trying to cover up the fact that she was too embarrassed/sad/traumatized/whatever to tell you, or she\u2019s kind of insane? Idk, take your time on this one, but let her explain when she can?", "NTA. This does seem like the sort of thing that ought to have been broached in 3 years of dating, and while she's allowed to have her past life and choices, I don't think it's fair on you to have failed to bring it up. What other things about her past hasn't she told you?\n\nAsking for space to think about things is the least you can ask for.", "NTA. I would be super concerned if my fiance failed to ever bring up something that huge and something that could affect me in the future.", "She didn't forget it, she just moved past that moment in time and has lived her entire adult life after it. This is not what defines her as a person or as an adult. So why do you think it defines her?", "How could it affect you in the future though, she gave the baby for adoption and looks like it was a closed one - no contact or further information.", "If the kid is still alive there's always a chance he or she can pursue who their parents were. Plus there's a potential baby daddy out there somewhere. It's a lot of connections that she conveniently failed to even mention after years."]}
