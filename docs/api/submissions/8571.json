I would just lose contact with her completely, that's not the kind of person you want in your life. You should have just uninvited her for that.\n\nHer comments about your engagement were unnecessary and hurtful.", "NTA doesn't sound like you have any reason to invite her. Will likely make your relationship with her worse if she expects to attend but doesn't sound like a huge loss really", "NTA. If you moved into her house it would have been toxic so better off that you stayed with friends. And she sure has a way with words. If you do not invite her to the wedding, that's the equivalent of becoming estranged and if that is what you really mean to do, then exclude her. Maybe that is going a little too far - your call.", "NTA - She's toxic, and you know she'll be making snide remarks all through the wedding and reception.", "Nta, it\u2019s clearly not just the comment. It\u2019s wanting her own daughter to stay with someone who is abusive and then at the last second leaving her and her husband to find a new place to stay and probably other things that accumulate over time", "NTA but in my opinion that\u2019s not enough of a reason to cut her out of the wedding. I think her comment was unnecessary but a lot of couples struggle while planning a wedding together so I do think making a year is awesome! \n\nI do think you should sit your mother down just you and her and explain all her actions that have led up to this potential decision and explain to her how her comments just put a strain on your relationship and that if she continues you will slowly lose that mother daughter relationship. I think depending on how she reacts and responds should call for your final decision.", "YWNBTA.\n\nShe prioritizes money over the safety and happiness of her daughter... that says everything. \n\nYou'd be too kind to still let her come honestly.", "NTA because I can see where you are coming from. If you decide to exclude her from your wedding, I just hope it is something you won\u2019t end up regretting.", "NTA, but cut contact now. She\u2019s toxic and doesn\u2019t ant what\u2019s best for you.", "NTA, huns, your mom is a character who just paints trouble with your future, living with her would\u2019ve been intolerable and could\u2019ve cause tension in your beautiful relationship, she\u2019s already turning her back on you when you most need her, she will be mad once she finds out , so what, she chose to be rude to you both and you don\u2019t want all that negativity around when you both are building your life together. Slowly keep your distance and be happy with your fianc\u00e9 .", "I mean... \n\nI don't think that \"Congratulations on making a year\" is a terrible thing to say (I got far worse from my ex MIL!).  If the comment is your reasoning for not inviting her, I'd say that's a little extreme.    \n\nBut I don't like the fact that her reasoning for not liking your fianc\u00e9e is financial.  I mean, you're building a house, so in this economy, you must be doing something right.  Did she actually say that she would rather stay with your abusive ex because he made bank?  \n\nI also don't like the fact that she waffled on her offer to put you up for 6 months.  Yes, it's a while, but you were honest with her about it.  And the excuses she made seemed to me to be just that - excuses.  \n\nYou're NTA for inviting, or disinviting, anyone you want to your wedding - it's your wedding.  But your overall relationship with your mother is more concerning to me than the comment she made.", "Maybe TA. Your mom is dead wrong about staying with the abusive ex. Only you can tell us if it\u2019s out of ignorance or malicious indifference to the abuse you endured. Anyway, this is the only thing that decision should be based on \n\nAt the same time, I think you both might be under communicating. Six months -is- a long time to stay in someone\u2019s home but it would be good to establish if she wanted you to stay or not. \u201cI took it as\u201d is making a huge leap that is unfair to her after she invited you to stay already.  The last comment \u201ccongrats on making it a year\u201d\u2026 I guess I cant read her tone but it doesn\u2019t seem bad to me.  \n\nIt seems like you want to punish her by not inviting her to the wedding. That\u2019s your prerogative but also an extremely hurtful move your relationship with her might not recover from when she\u2019s working on being better. I\u2019d just communicate with her to see where her head is really at in regards to your abusive ex, your new partner and your relationship with her", "NTA\n\nSounds like a straw that broke the camel's back moment to me. I have zero tolerance for this passive-aggressive bullshit. And wanting you to stay with your ex for the money? Ew! So no, you would not be the asshole at all. It may mean she'll stop speaking to you, but frankly from waht you've said here it doesn't sound like that'd be a loss.", "NTA for being upset about this, but I would wait a bit before cutting her out of the wedding.  It's a year away, I would just try to limit contact with her as much as you can, not moving in with her was a great start.  If she continues to insult you two, you have options, but I have a feeling if you do it too soon, she's going to make life hell for you.", "NTA is your wedding, only invite who you want to", "I'm from a different background than most Redditors, I totally expect to be downvoted (just like the last time I said it). In my culture, family ties are sacred, and wedding without both parents present is something that's only allowed under the most extreme circumstances. Your situation is far from extreme. It's just a strong disagreement and some one-sided bad blood between your mom and your future husband. Hate between in-laws is a super common trope around here, going back centuries. My father's mom despised my mom her entire life, too. But it never even occurred to anybody to not invite her to her son's wedding because of it. It would be an extremely disproportionate retribution.\n\nYou can start cutting her out of your lives after the wedding.", "Yta for the reason. Yes it's weird to say it. I think you're looking for a reason go uninvite her, just do it", "ESH. The examples you gave don't really seem that bad to me. Six months is a long time and she was probably feeling reluctant to house you both. And her congratulations was not exactly bad, maybe a bit impolite. You said she was trying to be nicer and she doesn't seem to be that bad. Before you uninvite her, you should probably have a serious talk with her and tell her you love your partner and will not tolerate her passive aggressive attitude.", "YWBTA\n\nYour mother is not a kind person.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to deal with her then don\u2019t but using your wedding to try to punish her is immature. You were just planning on living with her for 6 mos & now you want to kick her out of your wedding for a snarky comment.\n\nedit", "YWBTH\n\nI do not see anything wrong with your mother's second comment, it simply reveals that the meaning of her first comment (which could be taken either way) is that she has a particularly cynical and morose sense of humor. The tell is the ridiculously high number of years she gave.\n\nShe probably should have apologized for the first comment outright when you told her that hurt. But you did say she is \"trying\" to be a nicer human being. That was the try.\n\nI think this is all too minor to disinvite your mother over.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Also, are you intending to go no contact with your mom or do you want to have a better relationship with her later in life?", "NTA \n\nIf you think that her current toxic behavior will escalate on the wedding day and that she will make a scene about it then don't invite her!!\n\nYou should not in any way need to go on eggshells fearing your mother trying to ruin the wedding day for you for whatever reason she may have, be it because of her dislike for your current partner or god forbid her taking your ex as a +1 to \"convince\" you to go back to him or perhaps another reason that we yet knows!!\n\nHer last comment \"have to last another 40 years yet\" seems clear that she haven't accepted your current partner at all, so if you think deeply that she won't let a chance to take potshot at you and your partner at your wedding go out of her hands if you where to invite her, then for both yourself and your partner don't invite her, if you feel that inviting your mother will only cast shadow at your happy wedding with your partner then don't invite her simple as that, you mother have made her choice of bed and she likes to sleep in it now so let her sleep there and be in your wedding and enjoy it while she is at home without her clear toxic behavior staining your wedding!!", "YWNBTA\n\nYou said it plain as day in your beginning sentences: Your mother would have rather you stay in an abusive relationship. That's not someone you should actively seek to have in your life.\n\nShe's just shown you again she doesn't care for your relationship by snottily congratulating you on being engaged for a year even though you have been together for SEVEN years. You two have been together just shy of a decade, and shitty backhanded congratulations minimizing your actual time together are all she has to offer? What a bitch.\n\nWhy would you invite someone that doesn't support your union to the celebration of your union? That does not make sense.", "NTA she seems toxic.

Be the bigger person, just don't let her be too involved in the wedding if she will have a bad attitude.", "How is preferring your own daughter be abused than be happy and safe just a strong disagreement?", "I agree. I don't think OP is an AH for considering it, but the wedding's not until next year, and there's no need to go nuclear. There's plenty of time to work out the issues and make sure her mom attends.

What do you want your relationship to be with your mom?\n\nYou know (or at least should know because its common sense) that not inviting her to your wedding is going to be very insulting and possibly hurtful to her.  Its possible that the relationship will never recover from that.  That's an acceptable outcome if your intend to go no contact with her but fuck tons of dipshit idiocy if you think you'll have anything resembling a cordial relationship with her after the uninvite.\n\nYou know (and again at least should know) that its a decision that will polarize your family and maybe some other people you care about will take your mom's side resulting in you losing those relationships too.  \n\nAre you prepared for the consequences?\n\nIf so, NTA\n\nIf you have deluded yourself into thinking that life will continue with no problems, you're an idiot and YTA.", "OP said mother thought she should stay with her abusive ex because he made a lot of money.

Fully aware it will destroy the relationships, but it currently is a very nasty relationship where she likes to degrade me every chance she gets and then take credit for my achievements that she had absolutely no part in. \nThe only reason I\u2019m questioning it is because she has been trying to repair our relationship after I cut her out of our lives previously for almost a year. She never verbally apologised for it but did offer to guarantor our house for us and she very much uses her wealth as a means of apologising. I don\u2019t necessarily want to embarrass her but I know she will be nasty to my partner at our wedding", "> OP said mother thought she should stay with her abusive ex because he made a lot of money. Mother of the year right there!\n\nDid OP's mom use the word \"abusive\" when saying it? Or maybe she's just blind and stupid and doesn't see him as abusive at all? Once again, Hanlon's razor.\n\n> Just wondering if they happen to be from a culture that kids take care of parents when they get to retirement age? Because then it would be mother putting herself above OP because that money would support her.\n\nNow you're just making shit up. It's much, much, much more likely she simply wants the best for her daughter, and having a rich husband is one way to do it - it's just she's blind and stupid and doesn't realize how abusive he was.", "NTA\n\nAlthough if you intend to go no contact with her, don't wait for the wedding invitations to make that statement, do it immediately.  You want your wedding to be free of any taint or negatives, so don't use your invitations (or lack of) to communicate the end of the relationship."]}
