Honey, I\u2019m gonna be blunt and it\u2019s gonna hurt, but you have your grandparents right there and on your side. Your step mother has been working to push you out of the house if this is how she is speaking to you about talking to your dad. Your dad needs to step up right now or just leave you with your grandparents. If you haven\u2019t heard from him, and she told you not to contact him, she blocked you on his phone and he is none the wiser. Screenshot SCREENSHOT the whole conversation between y\u2019all, have someone help you record all her voice communications or have a grandparent there on speaker with you. YOU CANNOT SPEAK TO THIS WOMAN ALONE ANY MORE. it is okay for you to give your dad an ultimatum too, he needs to fix this. It\u2019s his responsibility to make sure you are safe and your step mother STEALING FROM YOU, and telling you it\u2019s because you don\u2019t \u201cdeserve\u201d what you bought for YOURSELF is not a safe environment for you. How an adult treats a child is NEVER the child\u2019s fault even if the child is out of line. Stay out with your grand parents. Talk to them about how you want to proceed. But honey, I\u2019m sorry, this was step mothers goal all along. I\u2019ve been in these shoes. You don\u2019t deserve this and it is never going to be your fault. You ARE NOT in any way the AH for buying yourself nice new cloths\u2026 it\u2019s also really weird that they keep buying you used underwear. Yucky.", "\u201cThrew it away\u201d?

That was your money and your belongings, your stepmother has no right to anything you say or do.

It's absolutely NOT just between you and her. Absolutely get Dad involved. Your dad is your parent, not her. She just wants to be able to abuse and control you without interference. I don't know if I agree with a young teen wearing Victoria Secret. i guess they have normal cute underwear, and not everything is ultra sexy lingerie. Your money could have gone farther with a different brand, though. You definitely deserve nice, well fitted underwear and not hand me downs. Hand me down underwear is  messed up to do to your kid.

The real question is how stupid is your stepmother to do something so invasive and beyond her pay grade.   She no doubt stole your property and I would call the police as this isn't really a civil matter, this was YOUR property that you bought with your money. Your father unfortunately is useless but in a way he is a necessary protagonist as clearly step mom is trying to alienate you from your father by claiming that this is just between you and step mom. \n\nIf your biological mom is not in the picture and your father insists on keeping this between you and step mom then you will no doubt need to go no contact at some point. Sorry OP I feel for you. Thank god for grandma's as you may need to live with grandma on a permanent basis. If your father truly understands the situation and is still backing your stepmother he is useless as your \"father.\" It is possible your number is being blocked by this monstrosity too, so before deciding to move in with your grandparents you should attempt to see your father in person and give him a final chance to make things right.

But legally, did she?  Maybe yes in that she has not adopted the OP, but if she were a parent, I believe parents can take away their minor childrens belongings.

You\u2019re under the impression this was a punishment when it\u2019s abuse and theft. Period plain and simple. The step mother has NO RIGHT to do what she did.
