You deserve proper support and hygienic undergarments.

I imagine you might have bought from their sister store VS PINK as well since the styles are popular amongst girls in your age range.  \n\nA hand me down bra is also less likely to offer the right support, let alone be the right size or even shape/style for you. It can be a distraction if you have to fidget with your bra straps or cups because it's not fitted properly. So having 3 new bras is a must. 1 to wear, 1 spare, and one to clean. Keep them on rotation. If you are athletic,  then having 2 additional sports bras are essential,  and VS PINK has some perfect bras that are reasonably priced for teenagers and college students. \n\nHaving clean unused underwear is also a must. Fibers can carry a lot of unseen germs and such from previous wearers that you might not see, and you can actually develop infections like yeast infections or skin rash from using second hand panties. This is why even if you have a sister the same age and size, sharing undies is a very bad idea too, because you can share infections. \n\nTell stepmother \"you ruined your own family.
