Even if you're not close, I can understand how your parents feel a bit butthurt over this (maybe they hadn't considered that your relationship was that distant ?).

While it's understandable that they may feel surprised or hurt for not being informed about your wedding, it's crucial to consider your reasons for not telling them beforehand.\r  \n\r  \nIf your relationship with your parents is not very close and they haven't made comments about your relationship in the past, it's possible that you assumed they wouldn't be deeply involved or interested. However, they may have different feelings about significant life events, such as a wedding, even if they didn't express them explicitly.\r  \n\r  \nIt might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your parents, explaining your perspective and why you chose not to have a wedding. At the same time, try to understand their feelings and express that you didn't mean to hurt them.\r  \n\r  \nUltimately, communication is key in resolving such situations, and finding a middle ground that acknowledges everyone's feelings and perspectives is essential. While you may not be the asshole for not telling them, the situation could benefit from a thoughtful and compassionate discussion to help mend any hurt feelings.", "They missed out on celebrating a life milestone with you.\n\nI\u2019m not saying you owed them that.  You get to choose how you spend your money and whether you want to plan even an inexpensive event like a courthouse wedding with a pot luck reception in a park or backyard.  Eloping is a valid choice.\n\nBut don\u2019t pretend that not getting to celebrate with you is nothing.

You obviously wanted to elope, so it was the right decision for you. Your family or anyone else does not get a vote. You didn't rob them of anything. My husband and I did something similar. We lived together for 12 years before we decided to get married. We eloped and told everyone after the fact. We did not care what anyone thought because it's our life and our decision. Nobody has the right to a front row seat in your life. Especially people you aren't even close with.

Lol. Wtf is wrong with you? Are you 18 or something?", "They missed out on celebrating your marriage with you, its a big deal for many people and to be left out like that can easily be insulting. That shouldn't be that hard to grasp. Not only did they miss out, but they didn't even know it was going to happen presumably. So now its a double whammy of missing out and the surprise that it happened. Weddings are expensive and I get why eloping would be considered the best option, but you should have told them. \n\nMild YTA.", "NAH.

We were both Marines, enlisted, and she got accepted for a commission to become an officer. I had no such hopes. We were dating, and got told it\u2019s either get married or break up so\u2026we got married. \n\nI didn\u2019t tell anyone until after the fact. So that\u2019s where I\u2019m coming from when I say this. I was an AH for that, just like YTA now. \n\nLook you might not be very close, I get it I\u2019m not with mine either, but you\u2019re an AH for avoiding them on this. If you wanted to just say \u201cwe\u2019re getting married, no wedding, you\u2019re not invited\u201d, hey not an AH. And if you were no contact with them, you DEFINITELY wouldn\u2019t be an AH.

You don't owe your parents a goddamn thing. Contrary to popular belief, parents who are good to their kids normally have good relationships with their kids.\n\nI get what you're saying about the wedding party 'right of passage' thing. You'd think that they'd had have said something about marriage since you've been together so long and especially if they were encouraging you to have kids - marriage provides legal protection after all.\n\nSounds like they're disappointed and they're allowed to be but you're also allowed to get married how you wish as ultimately the witnesses are meant to be your community. Sounds like, for whatever reason, both sets failed the brief.", "YTA and you will regret this one day", "NTA\n\nTo *me*, the phrase 'I would loved to have been there' is such a weird comment from others when I'm telling them something.

You can still choose to have some sort of wedding celebration in a casual/informal way, even on your first anniversary, *if you want to.* \n\nI'm not particularly close with my family either, and I probably would've done the same thing you did.", "Hey! As someone who isn\u2019t into the whole marriage thing because of the expenses and also because it doesn\u2019t really matter if you get married to your SO or not. I think I you two wanted it that way, then your families should respect that. It is your wedding day and a lot of people nowadays elope for a lot of different reason. If you\u2019re happy with it, then your family should be, too.\nThat being said: I don\u2019t know your relationship with your parents, but I\u2019m guessing a lot of parents are looking forward to their kids getting married and to celebrate with them.

I hate when family members make a wedding more about them than a marriage.", "Mostly NAH. You didn\u2019t have to tell them and they have the right to feel like they missed out. But you were being a little bit of an asshole by pretending like you have no idea what they missed out on. The wedding is much more than just an expensive party and you could\u2019ve had a cheap one at the park. They missed out on a chance to witness a huge life event. Even if you had done it at the courthouse, and there was no party, they could\u2019ve been there. Pretending like you don\u2019t know this makes you kind of an asshole because it\u2019s almost like you\u2019re gaslighting them a little bit. You are acting like they are crazy for saying they missed out on something that they obviously DID miss out on. It\u2019s OK for you to tell them that you didn\u2019t want them there, and it\u2019s OK for you to be honest.
