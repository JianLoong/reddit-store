They are asking what I'm doing, who am I, where is the nice old lady that was here, etc, etc. I keep answering their questions and they keep asking them. I am half annoyed, half entertained, and half endeared. Eventually their mom, I'm assuming, calls them inside. She comes out and starts talking with me, asking, well, the exact same questions lol. But after learning that i am single and bought this house by myself, her whole attitude changed.\n\nShe said that it was grossly inappropriate for a grown man to be talking with children for no reason. She said I should have told them to bugger off, and that she was really disturbed that i was talking with them. She said I'm lucky she doesn't call the cops on me for interacting with children without their parents present. I'm just sort of in awe of what I'm hearing, half apologizing and half not really getting what she is so angry about. Especially considering the fact that their was a 10 foot chain-link fence between me and the kids.\n\nAfter some more berating, I just put down my shovel and go inside to get away from her as she is stressing me the fuck out. Today I talked with another neighbor next to me that i met the day i showed up on the property. I asked him if he knew the angry lady that was yelling at me. He said he did, and that he would love to hear my side of the story. My side of the story? What dose he mean my side of the story? Apparently this lady put out a PSA on the local neighborhood watch about me, telling parents to proceed with caution.

I doubt you would be the first she's accused by her incredibly rapid accusation.  Unfortunately people like her can stir up ugly reactions.  Take care and protect yourself first.

Explain to them and let them deal with her. \n\nI would also make sure that you keep chatter to a minimum when talking to her kids,  she may try to turn things around on you.

Kids are curious - it is in their nature -  and such curiosity should be cherished and encouraged. I fancy I would have done much the same as you, in your position. I'd have probably answered their questions in fullness, explaining why the tree had to come down as a safety measure, why I was required to use a licensed tree company to remove the tree, and why I was digging up the stump myself.

Sounds like she overreacted. I always try to give people the benefit of the doubt... maybe one of the kids later said something about you that got misconstrued and then she just ran with it. Maybe she had a \"close call\" with a bad stranger around her kids in the past. Maybe she's just delusional.\n\nOut of curiosity, are you in an HOA? I am and my street has a woman like this. She's just a busybody and everyone hates her. She's initiated 2 seperate lawsuits over the last decade over idiotic things. \n\nWhat's hilarious is her neighbor owns a van and painted it pepto-bismol pink, and parks it on the street.

Nta; kids came up to you, asked you questions, you replied. Unless I missed something, that's all that transpired. Does she pull the kids of of classrooms when the teacher is single? Hell no. If you have an HOA, be wary that she may be on the board and might make your life hell. Best of luck.", "Obviously NTA. Your best bet is prob to call her and call her out on her silliness. If that does not work than your are in a full feud which will not end until someone wins. You could try spreading rumors about her, framing her for a crime, or calling child protective services on her.\n\nI probably would start off with something like ordering 100 pizzas to her house.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
