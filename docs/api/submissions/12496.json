We live in an area where the living cost is high, and while we aren't particularly poor, we certainly aren't doing that well either. My paycheck is enough to cover rent, utilities, and food with a bit of money left over, usually $10-15. I haven't managed to save up a lot over the years, as emergencies, though minor, keep using up the little savings I have accumulated.\n\nSo my daughter has recently been playing a game quite a lot, with some in-app purchases - perks/character upgrades. I have stressed, many times, that we cannot afford any of them (she has asked me for them before). However, today I noticed a charge on my credit card for a character bundle for $20. She has admitted to buying it, and acknowledged that it was irresponsible but that she really wanted it. I took away her phone, as a consequence for spending that money. (She doesn't do much on her phone, mostly plays games, browses some social media, etc. She does not have any friends that she is close enough to chat with them after school.) I will allow her to use it, under supervision, if she needs to use it for schoolwork. I plan to give her back her phone in roughly a week, if she's gotten the point that we cannot afford such luxuries.\n\nMy friend did say that it was a bit harsh, although I felt that it was justifiable.

She's shown she can't be trusted with a phone, therefore she doesn't get a phone. \n\nI will say once she gets it back you need to disable in-app purchases. There's parental controls that can help.", "**NTA.** The punishment fits the crime. \n\nAnd one week off a phone is NOT harsh. If she hadn't spent money *on* the phone, she'd still *have* the phone.", "NTA. And honestly you're lucky you caught it here. The systems in these games are predatory and designed to make people want to spend more money than they have. I've heard horror stories about people's kids dropping tens of thousands on these games.", "NTA but you need to setup parental controls on the phone to prevent this from happening. Both Apple and Google have them for their OS's. But not all apps honor them if you are allowed to enter the details directly with them (Epic and Fortnite come to mind). Epic just got hit with a 500+ million dollar fine because of this exact behavior.", "NTA. She spent your money when she was expressly told not to, so she deserves to be punished for it.\n\nThat being said, I\u2019m curious about your daughter\u2019s happiness levels. The fact that you say she doesn\u2019t have any close friends is a bit concerning to me. Consider that her game (might) be one of the only sources of pleasure and happiness that she has right now, and talk to her about it. \n\nGrowing up, I was punished but my parents always made me feel heard and supported. I think it would be super meaningful if you approached her from a kind place and asked her some questions about what she likes so much about the game.", "Based on the information provided, I would say NTA (Not the Asshole) in this situation. It is important for your daughter to understand the value of money and the financial constraints your family is facing. Taking away her phone temporarily as a consequence for her actions is a reasonable response. However, it might be a good opportunity to have a conversation with her about finances and why it's important to be mindful of spending, to ensure she understands the reasoning behind your decision.", "NTA at all. I got a gambling addiction out of one of those games: in my case it was a gacha, meaning it was a blind gamble for getting the character I wanted. I played it for free until one day I caved with a small bundle, like 5$, and before I knew it I spent thousands (on my own card, so no one knew until much later. I quit cold turkey, fully deleting my account, and after about a year I told my mum).\n\nI don't know what game your daughter is playing, but even with the non-gacha ones purchases can quickly become addictive. It's good you caught it early.", "INFO. Why does a 13-year-old have access to your credit card?", "NTA Can you set up something on the phone so she cannot make in app purchases? Or delete your credit card information from the phone? I am not great with tech, but if you call your provider or  check online  there should be something. Kids don't have great impulse control, you need to make sure this can't happen again.", "NTA I feel you. Grew up where every penny counts. I would disconnect the App Store from a pay source on her phone. Make it impossible to do in app purchases. Then I you can give gift cards as presents and they can use that for in app purchases.", "Are there not parental controls where it makes you give permission for app downloads / IGP?", "NTA   If you're barely staying above water financially, then that is a frivolous purchase.  But why does she have access to your credit card???   That seems to be the root of the problem.", "Nta. Not harsh at all.", "NTA Appropriate penalty for the offense. Remove her access to your credit card. She needs to learn this lesson.", "NTA. Completely relevant punishment, normal duration, and you\u2019re making allowances for reasonable supervised usage. A+ job mom", "NTA in the slightest.  Probably set up some sort of parental controls too so you have to put in a PIN for any sort of purchase to be made", "Info:  how was her phone allowed to make in-app purchases on your credit card without your approval?", "NTA\n\nIn my opinion, she got off light. Not only did she do something you explicitly told her not to do, but she stole $20 to do it. \n\nTrue, she didn't actually go into your purse and take out a $20 bill. However, she purchased something for herself using your credit card. That's theft. \n\nTaking away her phone for a week is light. She should consider herself very lucky she didn't grow up in my house. My Dad would have whipped my butt, taken away my electronics, and grounded me for a month. \n\nAnd I would have deserved that. Lying and thievery should never be tolerated by our kids. (I'm not condoning beating the hell out of a kid, either. I'm talking about a spanking. There's a huge difference.)\n\nNow, I'm not suggesting you do any of those things. I'm simply stating that she got off easy.\n\nShe'll survive a week without her phone. You did the right thing. \n\nAlso, as others have said, she needs to be careful with in-app purchases. There have been studies done that suggest these IAP's are as addicting as gambling. Now, I'm not saying gambling is wrong, just like I'm not saying that IAP's are wrong. Just that they both have been found to release serotonin in the brain, and that could lead to unhealthy (and very expensive) addictions. \n\nI know this one guy who, and I'm not exaggerating at all, spent over $50,000 on in-app purchases for a mobile game. \n\nIt was a mobile game that was free to download. \n\nIt can be a dangerous road if you're not careful.", "NTA. Maybe it\u2019s time to let your daughter know a bit more about your finances if you haven\u2019t already. Not that adult pressures should be put on a kid, but she should understand the basics.", "NTA ... but also (understandably) harsh.\n\nThis is a developmentally age-typical mistake for an older adolescent/younger teen to make. That doesn't make it acceptable.\n\nAnd $20 is ... a lot. \n\nAt this age they already know that taking someone else's money is wrong. They're old enough to be aware that the credit card is real money. So your child made a deliberate choice to steal from you because she wanted something. \n\nA talk about why it's wrong wouldn't be enough. The phone is directly associated with the behavior. I don't think a week at 13 is extreme. \n\nI think it's just the right level of \"harsh\".\n\nIt also doesn't mean she's going to be some sort of lifelong criminal! I know a lot of parents worry about that when this happens. But the temptation when a child has access to a credit card can be overwhelming. I'd suggest eliminating that issue as well.\n\nHmm... I might have taken the phone for less time and had her repay the money instead, if she has a way to do so? \n\nOther than that I can't think of anything I would have done much differently.", "NTA. I actually did this when I was a kid, and while I didn\u2019t get my phone taken away, I was given a strict lecture from my mom as to why I couldn\u2019t do things like that anymore (with her threatening to take my phone away if I did it again), and that was enough to make me stop. The punishment fits the crime, and it effectively gets the message across", "NTA. Actually sounds like decent parenting", "NTA. She abused her phone privileges; losing those privileges is completely reasonable and proportional.", "You are TA for not setting her phone up correctly.\n \ud83d\ude44\n\nDon\u2019t know all your excuses about why she doesn\u2019t need the phone, but instead of punishment like that, have her pay you back. Maybe even provide means to work it off? So she can learn how much money is worth, how hard it can be to make it, and stuff like that?", "INFO:  __How does it not bother you that your teenage daughter has no friends??__", "NTA. Your daughter is 13, in my country it would be legal for her to work a few hours a week at that age. A paper route or something like that. Would that be possible for your daughter? If she made her own money, she might learn the value of it more quickly. If she had to deliver papers for 4 hours in order to make that 20 bucks, maybe she wouldn't think those characters or whatever were worth it.", "NAH, because there\u2019s something not accounted for here: your daughter is getting scammed by an industry way out of her league.\n\nThose sorts of games are *intensely* predatory. They use the same techniques used in casinos such as cash to in-game tokens (like gambling chips) designed to disguise the real world money cost. A 13 year old is no way equipped to resist the psychological manipulation in play: there are adults who waste entire paychecks in a day and rack up $20k in credit card debt once the addiction kicks in. These free to play games start free because they can earn thousands after the player. \n\nI\u2019m in my thirties, familiar and practiced at shrugging off the techniques they prey on people and still enjoy one of these genres of games, and *I* have had to uninstall some of them when I realised it was too effective and had eased me into one-touch purchasing just a $2 here and there within a day.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
