I just so happened to have on a push up bra that day, and I couldn't exercise in it unless I wanted my boobs to fall out. So, when we got into the room, since it was a storage room, stuff was everywhere. I picked a spot behind this banner looking thing that was used for rifle marksmanship, point is, it was big. When I took my bra off, I turned around so they didn't see my boobs. But the girls were like, \"Oh my god! She's taking her whole bra off!\" I changed it quick, may I remind you, with my back turned.\n\nWell, everyone started freaking out about it and found it so weird that I changed my bra in there, when we were supposed to be changing. They started telling everyone about it, too. They told a boy in that class, and he asked me if it was true that I got fully naked while getting dressed because that's what they started saying. An older girl came up to me to talk to me about it (she was partly in charge) and said that me changing my bra in there made them feel uncomfortable and that from now on I should go to the bathroom (which, mind you, is all the way down the hall and we have 2 minutes to change) to change. I told her that they didn't have to look at me the whole time, but she said that it doesn't matter. She said that some of them may feel uncomfortable being in the same room as me while I'm changing my bra. After that class, people were still telling everyone about it. I genuinely don't know if I'm in the wrong or not. Some people are telling me that it was wrong, and some are telling me that the others are in the wrong, because we were supposed to be getting dressed anyway.\n\nSo, again, am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1695337983, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ouja6/aita_for_changing_my_bra_in_front_of_other_girls/", "score": 55, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Honestly, do you think the soccer, volleyball, football etc teams don't change in front of each other? No difference with JRTOC PT. Ignore them for being immature.", "NTA it\u2019s completely normal that they talk about it bc EVERYTHING turns into drama for teenage girls.

There's not much presumption of privacy in the military, at least in the beginning.\n\nNTA, but it sounds like the delicate flowers cannot handle other girls changing in the same space, so you will probably get blow-back.

I have been in the JROTC, as well as served in the USAF. They are all being ridiculous. For one, you should have been given a more proper area to change. Your body is simply a body. It sounds as if you were changing with other girls...and I'm sure they have seen breasts before. You said you even turned your back to them. I suppose as a compromise, you could change your bra while wearing your shirt. My wife does this...she will unhook it then kinda yank it out of her sleeve. Granted, she doesn't usually put another one on, but I'm sure it's doable. \n\nHonestly, when I was in highschool, everyone was an immature AH. I HATED having to change out of my uniform on gym days...as the boys' locker room was ultra filthy and hot. It took too much effort to keep a dress uniform nice, to ruin it by changing in such a gross environment. I understand at your age, people are uncomfortable and embarrassed about their developing bodies, but there's no reason to be. Our society hasn't really helped with this either... simultaneously titillating us with sexual commercials, while also telling us that behaving or looking certain ways is wrong. Plus our sex education is all sorts of backwards.\n\nI will tell you this. If these people who are harassing you over changing your clothes with your back turned behind a tarp are having trouble getting over the human body...they're in for a huge surprise if/when they eventually go through basic training. When I went through, I was still shy and embarrassed about my body. I was worried how I'd deal with having to change and shower around so many others. You get over that crap lightning fast when on the first night, the drill instructors crowd around everyone while you're exhausted and terrified...make everyone strip down and go through the showers and clean off (to ensure everyone is being hygienic). You didn't have time to be embarrassed. You just flung everything off and were in and out of the shower in less than 30 seconds...yet managed to be as clean as a whistle. Once you settled into a routine, it didn't mean anything to anyone...you were all essentially family and getting clean was just one part of the duty day. \n\nTrust me, you do you and things will get better as people mature. Well, not everyone will...but for the most part it gets better.

Nothing wrong with that, what is wrong is the girls freaking out, and of course rumors are passed around where it ended with you \"fully\" changing. I forget how cruel high school can be.

And Americans, I'm guessing! \n\nYou'd be horrified of the changing rooms conditions in my part of Europe where we get fully naked in the womens locker room and shower in view of each other.

Smelly teens is a stank of its own!\n\nBut you need to get some accommodations for changing before this.

Being a teen in a country where the body is something shameful and sinful and where you never see adults naked unless for sex is even worse!\n\nThe kids coming to my pool are used to seeing old ladies, fat ladies, breast amputees and other examples of the female body in the nude and get, somewhat, that nudity is for hygiene and cleanliness, not just sex. I'd have been ripped out of my home if I grew up in the US and told anyone I went and slept with my parents who both slept in the nude (as do I, way healthier for my vaginal health) and that I used to spend every saturday afternoon in the tub with my naked dad while my mom kept the cold drinks coming while we relaxed and had fun together. \n\nNTA but that school is setting you up for trouble like this. Please keep being this pragmatic about your body forever and pity the prudes that see sex everywhere!", "What you're describing sounds like mean girl bullshit.

No one at school should be telling others anything about your private changing time or your undergarments; no one who wasn\u2019t there should be asking you questions about your undergarments.\n\nThis whole thing is bullying of a particular kind, and if the school knows it\u2019s happening and fails to take steps to stop it, they can face huge financial penalties. \n\nTell your parents. Tell a teacher and the administration. Reference Title IX.
