(Not real names for privacy.) \n\nMy kids don't get along super well, Dax thinks \"pranks\"are really funny, I guess like every 12 year old boy, and he annoys Mia with them a lot. It's something my husband and I have been working on as it's the source of many fights between them. \n\nDax gets a lot of prank ideas from YouTube and TikTok and will often recreate what he sees. Most of them are harmless (something like a fake spider in her food etc.), but this time I think he went too far.\n\nDax thought it would be funny to put Saran Wrap over the toilet before my daughter went to the bathroom. He says he got the idea from online? Idk if this is a thing but it's a terrible prank. Basically he put plastic wrap under the toilet seat so if someone sits on it, well pretty much it makes a mess instead of going in the bowl. Yeah I know, ew. \n\nSo he does this right before Mia goes in the bathroom to pee. When she gets in there she sits on the seat like normal, pees, and since there's plastic wrap over the hole, her pee collects on it and gets everywhere, all around the ground on the toilet and on her. \n\nShe comes to me crying. She's embarrassed because she's a teenage girl and this is... disgusting. I told Mia to shower and not worry about the mess. \n\nHere's where I might be TA... I go to my Son and yell at him for what he did. I tell him that's not an appropriate prank and he's old enough to know that's not okay. And then I made him clean in up. \n\nHe started crying saying it's unfair I make him clean his sisters pee. \"It's gross and he's going to be sick.\" He says \"it's from her body so she should clean it.\" But it was all his fault and literally his mess to deal with, I don't know why I should humiliate my daughter further or why I should have to clean it. And biggest thing, he needs to learn. \n\nI told him the mess was his fault and he should think about the repercussions of his actions next time, because this is what his prank caused. And then I stood in the doorway and watched as I made him clean all of the urine off the floor and toilet. \n\nI think it was an appropriate punishment considering it's really just the natural consequence of what he did, and it doubles as a general lesson in how to clean a toilet which he has to learn at some point anyway. \n\nWell my husband disagrees. This all happened while he was at work, and after he got home Dax complained to him. \n\nHe told me I was overly harsh on our son and \"put him in danger\" by exposing him to germs. But I gave him the same gloves I use when I have to wash the toilet and it's not like he was unsupervised. \n\nBut my husband is mad at me and told me I want \"too far\" and that's \"bad parenting.\" Of course my son is mad at me too. But my daughter is on my side. \n\nAITA? Am I a bad Mom?", "created_utc": 1688736555, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14t7dv0/aita_for_making_my_son_clean_up_after_his_sister/", "score": 24, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're 100% right - your son needs to learn there can be consequences for actions.  \n\nA big question I have is what the hell is up with your husband and why is he defending your kid?  Not only are his arguments flat out bad, but is this related to some kind of \"that's women's work\" thing?", "> But it was all his fault and literally his mess to deal with  \n\nNTA Consequences of your actions and all that jazz, he needs to learn the lesson. This is parenting done right. Not sure what your husband is on about....", "NTA\n\nAsk your husband what message he thinks is being sent to each of your kids by your son pranking and embarrassing your daughter, but your daughter having to be the one cleaning up the mess the prank caused.\n\nI would be fascinated to know if there is some other rationale in his head beyond him being more \u201cconnected\u201d to your son than he is your daughter.", "NTA.  epic punishment.   He found out his harmless pranks aren't harmless.   If he were mine, he would be cleaning the bathrooms for at least the rest of the summer.", "NTA - Wow, what is up with your husband? Why on Earth would anyone but your son have to clean up the mess he caused?? He's 12 and knew exactly what would happen when he did what he did. You're teaching him a valuable lesson.", "Definitely NTA. You taught Dax for every action is a reaction and sometimes repercussions follow. As for your husband, well.... maybe he should be on toilet bowl duty for a while.", "NTA, the punishment totally fit the crime.", "Your husband sounds like he babies your son way to much. \"Expose him to germs and put him in danger\"? You all live together, there is fecal matter and all of your germs everywhere no matter how hard you clean. \n\nYou did the right thing. You do something stupid, you pay the consequence. \n\n100% NTA. Good on you for being a actual parent and punishing your child correctly.", "NTA.  Your kid is learning what it means to reap the consequences of his actions.", "NTA i hope this stops him from future pranks! He\u2019s lucky she was just peeing \ud83d\ude02", "NTA. What did he expect? Obviously someone had to clean the pee, was he expecting his sister or you to do it? Or did he just not think about repercussions? Maybe Dad should clean, except he was likely expecting you to do it...its bad parenting right up to the point where Dad himself has to clean. \n\nYour son was being a 12 year old jerk and learned a valuable lesson about what happens to jerks. \n\nExcellent parenting Mom. (from a dad).", "Wow, no question where your son got his vile behavior from. Your husband is so wrong in his thinking I would truly be worried about his judgment in other matters. You're NTA and I can't imagine making your daughter clean up a mess like that when her brother caused it. He'd be on bathroom clean up duty for a month.", "NTA\n\nBut I have a feeling your husband and his reaction are why your son is still pulling stupid pranks. Does husband always undermine you like that?", "NTA\n\nmaybe next time leave it for your husband to clean since he's against the idea, but i'm guessing he probably wouldn't like that either.", "NTA completely appropriate punishment, he's not exposed to germs, urine is sterile. He was the one that caused it, he should clean it up. As for the pranks if the other party doesn't enjoy them and he continues to do them then it's not funny, it's just harassment.", "NTA. Husband is showing acts of favouritism and plain idiocy.", "NTA. This is actually excellent parenting. Your son may rethink his actions in the future if he knows that he may be the one to suffer the consequences. You can also ask hubby if he wanted you to leave the mess for HIM to clean when he got home from work??", "NTA.  You did the right thing, Mom.  You and your husband need to have a good long chat.", "Youre definitely NOT a bad mom and definitely are NTA.\nThis was the most appropriate response. Ask your husband if he understands how floor cleaner or hand soap works.", "NTA. I would have done the exact same thing. His prank, his consequences.", "NTA your husband is a massive A for calling you a bad parent. \n\nConsidering people can drink pee because it\u2019s mostly sterile, the precious boy is safe.\n\n Is your husband responsible for cleaning the toilet at all or is it just you? If it\u2019s you, you might want to put him on toilet cleaning duty from now on, since he has shown an attitude about it and his attitude may be sexist rather than germ conscious that he protests.", "Absolutely an appropriate punishment.\n\nHe should be glad it's only urine.\n\nNTA", "If your husband thinks your son was in danger being exposed to germs, time for husband to take over toilet cleaning duty awhile. \n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nPlay stupid tricks. win stupid prizes. \n\nHe's learnig the disgusting way that actions have consequences. \"It was just a prank\" is not a get out of jail free card.", "NTA he had gloves he\u2019s fine.  His actions caused the mess.  He should be the one to clean it.", "NTA.  Your punishment was right on perfect and  soooooooo appropriate.  Your husband calling it \"bad parenting\"  Yeah, he needs to grow a brain...", ">He told me I was overly harsh on our son and \"put him in danger\" by exposing him to germs. \n\nSo your daughter should have been exposed to germs instead and had to clean up a mess she in no way had a hand in making? What is that? \n\nNTA. Cleaning the toilet isn't torture or harsh punishment. It's a household chore someone has to do. He just made it dirtier for himself by pranking his sister. Maybe he'll knock it off finally and poor Mia will get some peace.", "NTA - but your husband and son are.  Personally I think the punishment fit the crime.  His \"Prank\" caused the mess so he had to clean up said mess.  Lesson learned, and hopefully not unlearned by hugs saying the punishment was too harsh.", "NTA. Your husband is wrong. Your son is a bully. He will only get worse if there aren\u2019t any consequences for his actions. I feel sorry for your daughter.", "NTA. Kid caused a mess, kid cleans up the mess.\n\nHusband is an idiot. Daughters pee won\u2019t threaten your sons life *eyeroll*.  Did he never change diapers when your kids were small?\n\nAdditional YTA for not regulating the garbage your kid is watching on TikTok. Delete and block that garbage from his devices.", "Nta, wtf is wrong with your husband.  \n\nLet me guess he never changed a diaper cause \"he didn't know how\" do the same prank to him and make him clean it up himself. \n\nAnyway...great punishment.  In fact he would have to clean the entire house until I felt otherwise.\n\nAlso sounds like he needs some parental controls on his devices and any prank content BLOCKED!  And a whooping for messing up the bathroom.", "You were right. There wouldn't have been pee on the floor if he hadn't played his stupid prank. Your husband should back you up. He isn't doing Dax any good. I am tempted to advocate for his internet access to be restricted, he has shown he isn't using it responsibly. Btw, what did your husband think was suitable punishment? NTA.", "NTA. You had your son clean up after himself.", "NTA. Natural consequences.  Pranks are stupid and usually at least mildly cruel. Take away access to social media for a while too.", "NTA. Your husband wants a being the bad parent for not seeing this as appropriate punishment. So does it mean you don\u2019t have to clean the toilet anymore because you don\u2019t want to be exposed to other people\u2019s germs? I have a feeling sexism is behind your husband\u2019s reasons.", "Totally appropriate. NTA.\n\nGeez maybe they need to have it happen to them. You gave him gloves. It's not like he had to clean poop.", "NTA, perfectly appropriate punishment.\n\nAlso, this 'prank' has been around for at least 40 years, tiktokers got nothing on the '80s when we were all bored and stupid.", "NTA - anything that knocks sense into brats has to be a plus and if it\u2019s not dangerous for you it\u2019s not dangerous for him.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2019s not a joke if the other person isn\u2019t laughing and they are crying.  It is degrading\n\nPlain and simple, your son is bullying her as she is consistently annoyed.  Be careful because it is a matter of time until this behavior spills over into school.

I don't have kids but I still know punishments and enforcing them should be discussed between the parents to avoid this exact situation.

Also the saran wrap on the toilet is pranking 101 your son is not an evil genius unfortunately. ESH", "NTA. With a bit of luck, your son now understands that actions have consequences. Your husband needs to finally grow up and, as his father,  explains to his son that pranks aren't funny at all.", "NTA\n\nYou 100% made the correct choice in your form of punishment for your son. Children do need to learn the consequences of their actions. And as he is the person who caused the incident, he is the one who should clean up after it.

If you didn't make him clean it up he probably would have done something similar to this again. \n\nIt sounds like the dad is favoring the son a bit, shouldn't he be thinking about what the daughter has been through? The pranks need to stop and Dax won't understand that by just being told. The bad parenting is on the father here.", "This was my thinking. It wasn't much of a \"punishment\" in my mind, just the natural consequences of what happened from the prank. \n\nBut he was balling his eyes out the whole time and my husband says I went too far so now I'm rethinking my decision.", "He has a \"boys will be boys\" attitude about it", "I do regulate it the best I can. My son has to share his account password with me on TikTok, so I can log in and see everything he's watching and commenting. I did the same for my daughter until she was 13, it's a house policy. I've threatened to take away the app completely but my husband told me that's not happening and that would be \"ridiculous.\"", "He's played kind of similar pranks in the past and we always deal with it by restricting internet/games in some way. I'm okay with him doing harmless things like using fake spiders around the house or jumping out from behind a wall, kids will be kids and some of that my teenager isn't really bothered by. But once it causes something physical I draw the line. One time he dumped water on her, which to me that crosses the line from \"prank\" to just being an AH. She got wet and had to change, that's not a practical joke you can just take back. \n\nWell usually take his Xbox for a week and restrict his phone so he can only text and call but not use apps. But clearly since he did this that's not working and I thought this punishment was more appropriate. \n\nBoth of my kids have/had parental restrictions on their devices until 13. I think once you're a teenager you can have your privacy, and that's what I did for my daughter. Right now my sons phone is still restricted since he's 12, so it shuts off at 10:30 PM, certain websites/apps are blocked, and I can see everything he does on there. \n\nBut since my son has a specific issue I might need to keep the restrictions on him for longer than I did with his sister. That'll make me the villain of the house though.", "NTA. maybe next time leave it for your husband to clean since he's against the idea,", "Of course your son was upset.  He had to face the consequences of his actions and did not like it one bit.\n\nMaybe you should serve asparagus at dinner from now on.", "Of course he was crying. He was unhappy that he wasn\u2019t getting away with his shitty prank.", "If anything, I think you could've added on more! Like no devices for a week or something.", "NTA, Jesus. Tell your idiot husband that next time your son does something like this you will leave it for HIM to clean because you and your daughter are not doing it! Please stand firm on this, you are not the AH.", "NTA. And do not rethink your decision. Your husband should be backing you up, why isn't he stopping your son from constantly pranking your daughter?", "I fucking hate that saying.

Who did your husband think should've cleaned the pee up?", "Does Dad sneak him X Box time when he\u2019s grounded?", ">That'll make me the villain of the house though.\n\nNo it doesn't.  If he was behaving the same way as your daughter he'd be entitled to the same rules. If he's going to behave immaturely then you'll treat him appropriately until you feel he has earnt his privacy.  That's parenting not being a villian. Two kids don't automatically get the same rules.", ">That'll make me the villain of the house though.\n\nYou misspelled \u201cparent.\u201d", "No, that makes you the parent. Parenting isn't a popularity contest. He is in control of having access to things, he just has to follow reasonable guidelines. He chooses not to, so there are consequences. He should be mad at himself.", "Me. If he was home he would have done it himself and intervened. \"A parents job\" is how he put it. \n\nApparently it's \"dangerous\" for a kid because they don't know what they're doing and have \"weaker immune systems.\" It's literally a household chore though so personally I don't see his side.", "No at least he's not that bad about it. But he sees pretty much any punishment outside of basic internet restriction as \"too harsh\"", "Oh, give me a break.  As long as you use gloves and are careful it's no more dangerous than changing a diaper.", "Wow, your husband sounds like the villainous parent in a teen TV show who let's his bully children get away with anything and everything."]}
