We are in our 40s/50s and my husband has some ankle and foot problems that crop up periodically that cause him to use a cane for weeks or months at a time. This was one of those times, and when we arrived at the hotel he was using a cane.\n\nWhen we checked in to the hotel the person informed us that the hotel is spread over 2 buildings on a single city block, and that our room is in the other building. He pointed to a large man and said that man would show us to our room. You have to go outside the main building and walk roughly 1 city block outside to reach the other building. \n\nThe man who was to show us to our room said \"follow me\" and walked outside without offering to take either of our (small) roller bags or (small) backpacks. Ok, I guessed he isn't a bellman, he is just showing us how to get to the room since it's a little confusing to have to walk outside the building. \n\nThe man is walking very fast, while I'm walking slowly with my husband who is using his cane (while also dragging his roller bag). The man gets almost to the corner when he realizes that we are half a block behind him. So he stops and waits for us. We catch up and the man continued. He rounds the corner and wades through a crowd standing in front of a restaurant next to the hotel lobby door, up 4 steps and through the lobby door. My husband and I drag our bags through this crowd,  up the steps, and into the lobby to the elevator. It is at that moment that the man says \"oh let me take your bags\". He rolls our bags into the elevator and then into our rooms (which is right in front of elevator on 2nd floor). He turns on the lights and shows us the windows blinds etc. Then stands there looking at us, clearly expecting a tip.\n\nI was raised by barely working class folks who subsided on tips, so I ALWAYS tip generously, especially on holidays.  But here I was stumped and angry. Typically I would tip a bellman $3-5 for each bag they assisted with, but this guy didn't assist us with anything. I looked over at my husband sittiing on the bed rubbing his ankle. Then I thanked the guy for his help, wished him a merry Christmas and sent him on his way without a tip.\n\nMy husband agreed that it was weird the way he ran ahead of us and didn't help with our bags, but thought we should have given him a small tip anyway, especially since its a holiday.

He made your mobility impaired husband and you walk half a city block, through a crowd, up some stairs, around the mountain, and over the fields and didn't offer help until the last second.  No tip!
