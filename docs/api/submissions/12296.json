She has anxiety so it can be hard for her to stand up for herself sometimes. I have a girlfriend (f21), we don't have had any big issue for now. \n\nMy friend and I were working yesterday's morning. I was preparing a client's coffee and she was taking an older guy (around 30/40 years old) she did and started preparing it while I took another order. When she handed him the coffee the guy said something like \"oh you didn't put your number on it?\" And then he said something like \"it's a shame, I know how to take care of young girls like you, you don't have a boyfriend do you?\" I watched over at my friend as she looked very uncomfortable so I stepped in, I told the man that I was her boyfriend and asked if he had a problem about it. He apologized and left. I know I could've just called out for his behavior, but sadly as I have female friends this has happened more than once and it's easier to just scare them off then trying to make them understand why were they wrong. It was the easiest way to get him off her quick so we could keep working (we had a busy day). She thanked me, later she told me that man had previously made her a similar comment last week too, i wasn't there because it was my day off. \n\nI went to my girlfriend's house later that night and we were hanging out on her bedroom. I told her what happened and she told me I was a good friend for standing up for her but that I didn't had to say i was her boyfriend. I explained why I did it but she still told me it's not right. She's not angry or upset about it, but the fact that she told me she doesn't think its ok has made me think that maybe I was wrong here", "created_utc": 1678808262, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11r9fzh/aita_for_pretending_to_be_my_friends_boyfriend/", "score": 68, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I can see your girlfriend's perspective, but unfortunately we live in a world where a lot of creepy men will not take no as an answer until a man steps in. Good job protecting your friend.", "NAH.\n\nLike you said, she wasnt mad or upset. Its understandable you dont want your bf to refer to himself as someone else's bf even if its pretend. She understands it made things easier thats why she isnt mad. Maybe next time you can try something else.\n\nAlso, youre a good friend. Thank you for standing uo for your friend.", "NTA. You did her a solid and your gf is ok with it. Congrats on actually doing something", "NTA. You are proof that not all heroes wear capes. You did a *good thing* and I don\u2019t see where your GF would say it isn\u2019t right. You did the easiest, most non-confrontational way to get the creep away from your coworker.", "NTA.\n\nI have had several guys do this in the past. Thank you for standing up for your coworker to get a much older guy to leave her alone when he was clearly making uncomfortable. \n\nWomen need more allies like you watching out for situations where a guy can use his position as a customer to force a woman to do something she doesn't want to do (give him her number, let him touch her, put his arm around her, etc). He's counting on her being unable to say what she really wants to say due to fear of being fired.\n\nI hope your GF never is in a situation like that; but if she ever is, I hope there is a guy who acts the same way you did to help her out of that situation.", "NTA - you are just looking out for your friend.", "NTA. \n\nThank you kind sir.\n\nSincerely, \n\nAll women that a man has ever been creepy to while searching desperately for a quick exit.", "NAH i understand why you did what you did but it\u2019s understandable why your gf doesn\u2019t feel comfortable with that. I highly doubt that anyone would feel comfortable with that. If he is a regular customer than i would tell that to your manager because this is harassment. Maybe next time you can call your manager or call the guys out for their behavior.", "NTA, calling him out on his bs would cause an argument and maybe get you fired if your boss is also an AH. This was quick and easy. You did very well.", "I'm going to answer with the assumption that your friend was completely okay with you stepping in like that.\n\nNAH (apart from that creepy dude). I wish we lived in a world where men didn't act like any woman is available for their pleasure unless she is already another man's \"property\" but here we are. There's way too many men who will ignore a woman's *no* and only back off when another man steps in. It's not right and it's not okay but it is reality. I hope one day that'll change. Until then, thanks for having your friend's back.\n\n(btw, it would be best to talk to your friend and make sure she really was okay with what you did, and ask what she'd like for you to do if the same situation happens again. She should be the one to decide if she wants help or if she'd rather handle it on her own.)", "NTA. You did your best in what was a difficult situation for your friend.", "NTA. I would hope that my bf of 5 years would do the same/similar if he saw someone who was clearly uncomfortable in a situation where they are too passive to turn down an advance. It\u2019s not like you did anything to \u201cprove\u201d you were this girls bf. You didn\u2019t touch her, kiss her, nothing. You saw that she was uncomfortable and you diffused the situation with your words in a way that kept everyone safe. Some people can\u2019t take no for an answer and clearly that guy was one of them since he made prior advances on her. Even worse, some people get angry when the other party simply isn\u2019t interested. The receivers of this often see it as easier to lie and say that they\u2019re in a relationship because it\u2019s less personal to the pursuer. It\u2019s less likely to raise anger as a result of true rejection. The girl you helped probably felt safer with what you did to intervene than if she told the dude she simply wasn\u2019t interested. I feel like your gf was speaking out of insecurity since you have shown no indication of being actually interested in your coworker. You\u2019re definitely NTA", "NTA\n\nEither your girlfriend has never been in that position or lacks empathy.", "NTA. It's a good strategy for dealing with creepy men on behalf of a friend. I've done it for a male friends when a woman was harassing him.  No harm, no foul. Your girl friend should understand this.", "NTA. A lot of men will only respect other men's \"property\", so they won't back off based on a woman's responses about not wanting to be around him. It sucks a lot, but you were in a time pressured situation, the man knows where she works (potential stalking situation) and knows her name because for some godforsaken reason we're still doing that in retail. \n\nYou made the right call, this guy clearly only saw her potential boyfriend as an obstacle to him getting a date, not her actual wants and needs. Please continue to call out bad behavior and protect women - we really need it right now.", "NTA I am 56, and over the years I have found the fastest, easiest out is the one you took. Claiming to be a female friend's boyfriend is the best way. Other ways all have far more draw backs.", "NTA, of course! I'd tell all the coworkers, male and female you can be fake boyfriend if it helps!", "Sounds like you\u2019re a bit of a confrontational guy. You could\u2019ve just told him that she wasn\u2019t interested and to leave her alone.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t say you\u2019re an asshole, but I agree with your girlfriend. She probably felt a little bit jealous. \n\nI once had a female coworker lie and tell a male coworker that I was her boyfriend. I think he was hitting on her like in the same situation. Turns out she had a crush on me. So, be careful with your words.", "NAH\n\n\n\nI've had guy friends be my stand in boyfriend when weirdos were afoot, and they were awesome. One even did it while his actual girlfriend was with us at the bar (thankfully she and I were friends, too, so she played along immediately).\n\n\n\nI'm surprised your girl is upset, though, I feel like it's almost a universal experience for us ladies to have a trusted male friend play the \"I'm the boyfriend\" role, and personally I'd be happy knowing my husband would do the same thing, even for a stranger.", "YTA. You're not the bf. There are other ways to handle this sort of thing. Also, your friend is 23. Time for her to grow up a bit and learn how to handle unwanted attention.

THAT CUSTOMER IS THE AH For hitting on a young woman at her work. If you had tried to point out that he was being creepy you could have caused a negative reaction and the customer could have blown it out of proportion.

I've told someone before that I was married and the basic response was \"well he's not here now\"\n\nIt also doesn't work if a girl steps in for another girl (in my experience). I was out with my cousin and a creepy guy wouldn't leave her alone. We were the only 2 there so I said she was my girlfriend. And rather than backing off he asked for a threesome.", "Do you know how could I help her (or another coworker) in a situation like this without getting physical/ risking my job? The times were I tried to step in and telling them to leave they always would make a big scandal and not in Starbucks but I worked in taco bell some years ago and my manager there reprimanded me even though she knew what happened. Should I threaten them to call my manager? Or the police? I'm seriously asking because we don't get any training in this and I don't know how can I help while keeping my job safe", "Some years ago I worked in taco bell and something like this happened with another coworker, I called the guy out and he made a big scandal, I ended up getting in trouble with my manager even though she knew what happened \ud83d\ude12 some managers suck really", "Exactly. I've had married friends so this when a guy was being particularly aggressive/creepy. It sucks that this is what it takes for some men to take no as an answer.", "Oh I see, i don't think my friend has a crush on me and I never say stuff like this in a regular basis but I'll keep it in mind", "Thank you. Some sanity in here", "\"Sir, this is a Starbucks, it's not speed dating\" \n\n... I'm only half serious with that, but I think a good thing to do would be to just walk up and ask if the ~~creepy asshole~~ customer needs something else. That lets your female coworker make a graceful escape, isn't confrontational enough to endanger your job, and hopefully lets the ~~creepy asshole~~ customer know that he's being out of line. If that doesn't work, then you can call a manager over or say something more direct.\n\nAlso it feels like a good time to remind everyone never to tell a customer when a coworker is scheduled, when she gets off work, or anything other personal info, no matter what they say. OP, I know you didn't and wouldn't do this, it's just a reminder for everyone reading that doing that can put your coworker in danger.", "Its going to be very hard if your manager doesnt have your back or is the dismissive type. You can still ask for standard procedures for harrassment. As a company, they should have those in place. If they dont, ask if it's alright to refer it to them if a customer gets too rowdy. If they dont have policies in places, they might be open to resolving it themself. Talking about this may be more effective if its not only you. Its better if your co-workers would speak up as well so your manager would realize it is a serious issue and could lessen consequences to your job.\n\nAs a band-aid resolution, or if the manager really doesnt care.\n\nI recommend going with the standard \"I have a boyfriend\", or \"I'm not interested\" line everytime someone tries to overstep. They probably already are but I felt the need to do that. If a customer still wont stop, and they cant get out of the situation by themselves, try making up a signal.\n\nIt can be a hand signal or some kind of gesture (i.e touching their hair a certain way, maybe tugging on their earlobe, preferably something subtle). If the customer is a repeat offender, take note of them, and ask your co-worker to let you or someone else know when a problematic customer comes in, or when they are about to serve, so they can pay attention and watch out for a signal if needed. When the signal comes, you can try to call for your co-worker, pretending there is something you need help wih, or a job they have to do, so you can give them a way out of the situation. Chances are the customer would let them go since  nothing aggressive was done. If they try to stop them by touching them, thats the time you can step in.\n\n\nDont forget to keep an eye for the stalker type, remind your co-workers to bring legal tools they can use for self-defense. If any creep seems to be staying for far too long, or waiting outside for one of you to get out of work, and youre fearing for safety, call the police.\n\nI'm sorry this seems to happen all the time. I'm a woman too but my jobs have never been as customer facing as yours are so I'm not exactly sure how practical my recommendations are.", "I know it may sound... peculiar but I have a friend that when he was in a relationship he would always say he was my bfs brother, \"you're talking to my brothers girl, you better leave\" kind of thing.", "Whisper to him, *Dude!

We're just buddies. \n\nDepending on the situation I would understand if my gf did that, although I think girls don't care when something like that happens, some girls believe it's better of you have a girlfriend. I had a lot of girls insisting even after I told them I was not single, it sucks. But if it would help out a friend or coworker than I would understand", "I think you may have responded to the wrong comment", "It\u2019s not that you have a crush, but that you might be perceived as having one by your gf.
