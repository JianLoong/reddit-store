It\u2019s awful of your parents to put such responsibility on a young kid and she does need a wake up call before your younger siblings have to live through parenthood in their early teen years when you refuse. Since your family is aware of the issue I\u2019d look for help from someone who your mom sees as a bit of an authority and would more likely take more seriously.", "INFO: Is there any reason your parents can't take care of their own kids or are they just AH who force you to do it?", "INFO: what do other medical students in your program do for living arrangements? I\u2019m assuming you are not in the US based on your age\u2026", "NTA. And hon, you need to move out. After a decade of this behavior, your parents won't change. you need to make yourself unavailable to them. The only way to do that is to get out.", "NTA your parents have relied far too much on you as an older sibling. I commend you for taking such care of your younger siblings and I don't blame you at all for believing that another little one would be thrown on your plate. I think sitting down with your Mom and or both parents and voicing your concerns would go miles. I'd also recommend setting boundaries and emphasizing how important your education and goals are and define clear boundaries regarding this possible new younger sibling.\n\nI wish you the best and know that you're not wrong for being concerned about a new addition to not just their lives but your life as well at such an important point in your adult life.", "Sounds like your mother really likes making babies for you to raise.\n\nIt's totally fair for you to set the boundary of, \"If you have another child, you will have to raise it yourself or hire a nanny. I do not have the time, energy, or desire to be a care giver for a baby.\"\n\nNTA.", "NTA.  And the argument that \"it is her body and her choice\" Doesn't apply here.  That argument says others can't force her to have children she doesn't want to have, not she can force others to raise her kids.  But she sure can try to guilt you into doing it, so be prepared for a fight until she gives up.", "NTA. But if your mom does choose to have another baby, make it very clear that you will not be helping with childcare. It is her responsibility, not yours.", "NTA for not wanting to take on parental responsibility for a sibling. YWBTA for trying dictate the noise and chaos level in the household. If I were you, I would very clearly communicate to your mother that you can't be counted on to provide the kind of help you have in the past and that you have a hard time imagining how you could do med school with a baby/young child in the house. Then come up with a Plan B for yourself should she get pregnant and/or not respect your boundaries.", "NTA\n\nTell your mother you cannot take care of a new baby, period.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ngo to your school and tell whoever your contact person is about this situation, and see if there is some way you can get a loan or something to pay for an apartment. If you are a prodigy in med school, they will want to keep you.", "She has 3 kids, and wants one more? That's madness. She must be a very vapid person with no other personality trait than being a lazy mother. OP, I hate your mother.\n\nYou've been a model student, cared for your siblings, what more do they expect from you? You'll be a doctor to help them financially down the road, can't they see that? Yes, I think they have the OBLIGATION to give you shelter, food and respect for the whole time you're in college.\n\nNTA. Be stern about it. You will not help raise another child and you WILL stay at home for as long as you want. Why? Because you go above and beyond each time and they must recognize it. Be serious and put your foot down. Tell your father to get a vasectomy. Say that if they have another child you will leave and cut all contact with them forever. And mean it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

No regrets", "NTA Sweetheart you aren\u2019t those kids parent you will be a sister and it\u2019s not your job to take care of the kids your mom is deliberately popping out for whatever reason. I feel so bad for you that you don\u2019t have the means to move out and I know it\u2019s hard but you\u2019re going to have to figure out some other arrangement for your own peace of mind.. I wish you the best of luck..", "The majority are living at home as cost of living has gone insane. I am in the United States, my age is due to my starting college at 14 and taking additional classes every summer and throughout the regular school year to accelerate my degree. But that is a very valid question, some also have wealthy families and are put up by them in apartments.", "How is she supposed to do that when she's not allowed to work?", "Is scholarship a possibility to get on campus and out of the house? Being gone will force her to take care of her own baby.", "NTA for not wanting to serve as a parent to your sibling. But you can\u2019t expect to live at home and have your family cater to your needs as an adult. If you want control of your space you will need to find a way to get your own place.", "They do not cater to me. You are by policy not allowed to have a job in medical school, housing is not free, even for future doctors. I am studying medicine to financially contribute to my family. I understand how people outside of the medical community cannot understand that.", "The library is also an option if you want a quiet environment to study medicine.", "I work in health care and know several people who went to medical school. They took student loans to cover living expenses. So it\u2019s possible even without a job.", "That's an excellent point. Many dorms/shared rooms are also a terrible place to study and yet people find a way to make it work.", "OP's parents would have to let them leave in the first place... seems like they keep tying OP down with kids.", "I also have the listed family responsibilities, unless you would like to cover my loans or fulfill my at home responsibilities then I'm not sure what to tell you.", "Bc no one's asking them to take care of babies. OP isn't saying they can't bear to be in the same house with a baby, they're saying that they will be expected to parent said baby. Which eats into study/sanity time.", "Why do you have home responsibilities? Why are your parents not looking after their own kids? And why on earth would they want another child if they aren\u2019t looking at the r the ones they already have?\n\nYour priority should be in yourself and your studies. It\u2019s lovely that you want to support your family, but you won\u2019t get to be a doctor if they palm their kids off on you to the point your studies are impacted. NTA, but your parents are", "Your parents should hire babysitters instead of you then.", "INFO: Did you take out student loans? Can they cover housing?  Are you more worried about lifting your family prospects than your parents? Because if your mom is considering a\nhaving another child and you were/are parentified due to finances maybe you're parents like were they are at financially. There are ways to support your siblings without running yourself into the ground for your 'parents'. If they can be selfish you can be too for your own sake.", "Honestly, I think you should not have that level of responsibility for another sibling. You are not at fault for any of this, but unfortunately you are going to be subject to the rules of the house if you live there. There is a cost to everything, and as an adult it\u2019s up to you to decide which costs are worth the benefits.", "The only family responsibilities you have are ones you volunteer for. Children, even adult children, are not supposed to feel responsible for their parents or their parents' other children. You're responsible for yourself.\n\nI guarantee you the other students in your program don't think they have to take care of their parents and their parents' kids. You have been traumatized into thinking you do. You need a THERAPIST.", "My responsibilities were imposed upon me. Although the easy and petty thing to do is say no, it is not in the best interest of my siblings. I refuse to withhold support and punish my siblings for my parents actions. And no, loans would not cover the full extent of what I would need in my particular instance. High interest loans are counterproductive to my goals of being able to help my family significantly in a financial way. There is a reason I am avoiding these predatory loans. However those are valid questions.", "Rules of the House?! So you are saying no matter the rule or request you should be expected to follow it because you live in their home????", "Are yiu planning on helping your siblings as they become adults?   Because giving your mom money is passing it away.", "Yes.", "On the topic of costs, do you know how much decent childcare, regular food delivery/preparation and daily cleaning services would cost? I also have 100% of my tuition covered via scholarships. I am not leaching, I am helping. It's not a matter of the rules of the home, it is also my home and I contribute as much as anyone else.", "Rules are things like, clean up after yourself, maybe some carpool duty, no overnight guests. Not: raise my child for me. OP's parents aren't asking for reasonable rules.", "Hate to think what crazy rules your home has?!?\n\nHouse rules are something that should teach respect and responsibilities. Forcing your child to care for your child is not a reasonable expectation that should be forced on someone. She may now be old enough to leave but she doesn't have the means. \nIts completely fair to refuse to do this and confront her parents on the matter"]}
