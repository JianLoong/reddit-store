Why do the outfits need to be seen right that second?\n\nSleep is very important for overall health and well-being.

Why have you been tolerating this? Should have stopped her right from the start and not make it a habit.", "NTA. She is definitely selfish and self-centered. You have asked not to be awakened, and she kept crossing that boundary. Now she is pouting because she crossed the line too many times and got what she deserved. I wouldn't apologize. It is she who should be apologizing.", "NTA \n\nDo you have another room? Move into that room and lock the door. Sleep deprivation is no joke. \n\nPlus, if she would stay awake during the day, her sleep schedule may adjust so she sleeps at night. I work shift work and she has adapted her body to that schedule.", "Maybe she should work, help regulate her sleeping schedule and give her something to do.

She may be happy with her unusual sleep schedule, however she has no good reason to be waking you at all. \nYou need to sit her down and tell her to quit waking you, and cease the entire outfit sessions. Other than that, separate rooms with a lock. \n(Note - my teenager likes to try on outfits and make up at stupid hours, but she just takes photos!)", "NTA.  She is being selfish and rude.\n\nShe seems to be very interested in her clothes. \n\nYou could set boundaries around her waking you to show you her outfits but refusing to give her money for shopping if she wakes you up and/or donating to charity each and every outfit that she wakes you up to see.  Perhaps you could set a scheduled time, after dinner, before bed, which is the ONLY time that you will look at clothes.", "Um... NTA. Is she getting therapy?

I do not toss abuse lightly but because you have repeatedly asked her not to and your are not getting any consistent sleep, night after night, you are facing likely sleep deprivation!

She absolutely needs to let him sleep, but her getting a job won't necessarily fix that.", "As I was reading this I was thinking bipolar myself.", "Right, that\u2019s basically said in my second sentence.", "I didn\u2019t say she *needs* one. I was responding to savage-and-co\u2019s suggestion that having a job could help regulate her sleep by giving her more structured time. It won\u2019t necessarily work, but it could. OP is NTA for needing uninterrupted sleep, wife isn\u2019t one for having irregular sleep patterns. But she IS an AH for waking him up for trivial time fillers. If she is bored, she needs to find better ways to fill her awake hours than waking her husband for an impromptu fashion show. Maybe a job is the answer. Or maybe a quiet hobby or gaming or reading or myriad things besides waking him up. The shift work was just a suggestion.", "This isn\u2019t how bipolar works. You\u2019re not all manic all the time. Bipolar Disorder has different levels that are characterized by the severity of those cycles, with periods of leveling out in between. It\u2019s cyclical. Mixed episodes are possible, but still end after weeks - months. \n\nBipolar 1 is about 7 days or more of mania that\u2019s so bad it can lead to hospitalization, followed by 2 weeks or more of depression, up to 4 of these cycles per year if you don\u2019t have the type that rapid cycles, usually 2 on average. Bipolar 2 has less severe mania (hypomania), but the same criteria for cycles. \n\nNow, these cycles *can* last for months, but for it to have spanned their entire marriage, we\u2019re talking about *years straight* in a hypomanic or mixed cycle. That\u2019s not bipolar.\n\nShe could have some sort of sleep shift disorder or a dysfunction of her circadian rhythm, but that wouldn\u2019t cause her to be a completely inconsiderate person who thinks it\u2019s okay to disturb *someone else\u2019s* sleep. The two likely aren\u2019t connected.", "NTA. This is deeply odd on her part. Sounds like it's ritualistic behaviour she can't quite bring herself to stop. Help needed I think.", "NTA. Sleep deprivation is considered torture. For her to wake you up for any reason other than an emergency is extremely inconsiderate.", "LMAO!!!", "Omg NTA. What is wrong with your wife?", "NTA. Repeated deliberate wakings and deprivation of sleep is a form of torture forbidden by the Geneva convention. \n\nWhy is your wife torturing you? \n\nIf she needs attention that badly she should try going out and interacting with people during the day. \n\nPerhaps she needs the stimulation of interaction? \n\nMight I prescribe her getting a job so she is both receiving stimulus and perhaps doing enough to get tired on the same schedule as you?", "NTA wtf?", "NTA, she's incredibly rude and inconsiderate to do that! WTF? \n\nSounds like she needs to get a job to be forced to function like a normal person!", "NTA at all. My husband and I sleep separately because we have wildly different sleep needs not to mention our daughter heavily favors my comfort when she wakes up. But I don\u2019t disturb my husband and he doesn\u2019t disturb me. That\u2019s just common sense. He\u2019s much like you, once he gets woken up it\u2019s near impossible for him to fall back asleep. I wouldn\u2019t dream of waking him up unless it was an emergency.", "NTA and that is really strange behaviour from her, not the only sleeping 3 hours during the night but the trying on outfits and waking you to ask if you like them. You are far more patient then I would be, I couldn't be doing with that at all.", "NTA she sounds very inconsiderate, maybe show her this thread so she knows she\u2019s in the wrong", "NTA. Maybe buy several old school alarm clocks, set them for different times and place throughout the house for during the day", "No, honestly she needs to let you rest. You asked her to do it in the morning, she didn't listen.\n\nShe wakes you up in the middle of the night to look at outfits? There are other times to do that and solutions too. \n\nI used to struggle with sleep but whenever I was awake and everyone else was asleep I let them sleep. Just because I was suffering it didn't mean they needed to suffer too. I have other things to keep me occupied.", "She sounds like a toddler. She can try on outfits somewhere else or before you get home. Lock the door.", "NTA.  That would be a two and done activity for me.  Warning on the first, I'm out on the second.", "NTA but she is acting like one.", "Thank you!!! Somebody who saw the abuse! Why aren't others signaling the very obvious tactic of an abuser?", "Since she is being abusive, \"annoying\" is the very least she deserves. She is orturing her husband. Sleep deprivation is not joke... and was used for torture.", "The weirdest thing I've read is you not thinking she's an ah. That's truly wild", "She does this multiple time, all the time. It's not anxiety, it's selfishness. Why are we always so quick to defend assholes here with possible mental illnesses? \n\nOne thing I've often noticed, is that if the wife is an asshole, there's always comments about \"this doesn't sound normal, please get her checked out\"\n\nBut if the husband is an asshole, it's red flags, abuse and leave.", "Well, she is physically abusing him by literally making him lose sleep, which has physical and mental consequences.", "To be clear, I absolutely said she is TA and am not defending her. Not every person who has a problem with their spouse wants to get a divorce and divorce isn\u2019t even an accessible option in certain cultures. OP mentioned this weird sleep schedule like anyone could have a sleep schedule like that. That is disordered sleep and there is something going on. No healthy adult just pops up after three hours of sleep on a regular basis. A health professional is in the best position to help evaluate. If she is sleeping at night she won\u2019t be throwing a fashion show. Mental health and lack of sleep absolutely can result in impaired judgment. \n\nMental health and/or sleep disorders wouldn\u2019t make this okay. If they\u2019re a contributing factor a first step in apologizing would be working to address them. Even if she was in full psychosis and was incapable of understanding the wrongfulness of her actions, OP should take the actions he feels are necessary to protect his own health and safety that of his patients. I have no idea how long this has been going on or if \u201cevery night\u201d is an exaggeration from the post. If it\u2019s been going on for an extended period and it\u2019s not an exaggeration, I have no idea how he even has the capacity to care whether he is being an AH. Marriage tests a lot of things but it\u2019s not supposed to test your capacity to withstand literal torture.", "Well, I was in such a state of shock\nI completely blacked out, I can't remember a thing", "He doesn\u2019t mention kids either, so she should contribute equally to the marriage, and just housework isn\u2019t equal to a 40 hour week at work.", "YTA for being a Chiropractor", "NTA, is your wife insane? Who in their right mind does this\u2026", "NTA. That\u2019s a super weird and inconsiderate thing to do.", "NTA and I would suggest therapy\u2026 or getting something to do during the day, a job, a hobby, just get back on a regular schedule. This is extremely odd.", "Can I vote him YTA for being a chiropractor?", "I feel as though information is missing here.", "NTA", "NTA but you DID insult her and say something mean, saying someone is \u201cannoying\u201d is rude, even if it feels true in the moment. You should probably speak to your wife about addressing her mental health and probably get diagnosed with a sleep disorder.", "NTA\n\nYou have asked her not to wake you up in the middle of your sleep to show you outfits.\n\nShe has ignored that request.", "NTA. I don't know if she has a sleep disorder but either way, she has to choose a better time to do that in my opinion. She has lots of free time on her hands and she chooses to do this now? Ridiculous! Anyways, all the best.", "NTA. Does she use drugs? I'm serious.", "NTA she is incredibly selfish, dtich the wannabe fashionista", "You're the asshole but not for the reason you think. You are an asshole because you're a chiropractor! Ya'll literally hurt people for a living", "NTA she's making you the bad guy for her poor behavior and yours.", "NTA. Tell her to get a job or it\u2019s a divorce. \nHopefully, she will just sleep through the night.", "OP, if your wife is doing nothing all day long, then isn't tired at night and keeps you up, then sleeps while you're working, this situation isn't sustainable. You two need to sit down, possibly with a therapist, and figure out another answer. Maybe she needs to work during the day to get herself on a better schedule. Maybe she needs to sleep in another room. Maybe she just needs to learn how to be considerate. Regardless, you need to address this.", "Agree this sleep interruption/deprivation is classic abusive, controlling behavior on the wife\u2019s part. I\u2019m really surprised to have scrolled so far before seeing this posted.", "Tbh he said \"as usual\". This story has as many holes as Swiss cheese.", "As usual because it's something she regularly does, that isn't a hole", "If you want everyone to always agree with you, this is not the thread for you. \ud83d\ude02", "I'd like logic or reason, neither of which you've demonstrated. \n\nPointing out an actual hole would be a start", "NTA time to see a Dr and a therapist because there could be something actually wrong with her. There are people that argue about the 8 hours of sleep being an industrial construct, but only sleeping 3 hours at night is not normal.", "Honestly, that's fucking ridiculous. She's actually waking you up to show you a dress? And you work, and she doesn't?\n\nShe's incredibly inconsiderate.\n\nNTA.", "NTA but your wife sure is. Who the hell think it's ok to wake up a sleeping person every single night?\n\nShe obviously needs to get a job.", "NTA- wife sounds pretty self indulgent. And then adds the silent treatment? Sad", "Wonder if there is any other person on the planet that is being woken up with a middle of the night fashion show??? Ima say this poor guy is only one! Surely! This is bat shit crazy!!", "NTA, you should demand she gets a job. She gets to sleep during the day and then spoil the sleeping time of the one putting food on the table? She shouldn't be aloud to sleep during the day.", "Such BS. You married her without knowing she did this? Your wife had this behaving for how long before you snap?", "NTA", "Many posters have called her behavior the abuse that it is.", "Lol. Doesn't sound like financial abuse to me. She has SO MANY CLOTHES, she keeps him awake at night to look at all of her outfits.", "I'm saying I think it WOULD BE to answer her abuse with some from him.  She's bad.  Real bad.  An AH, for sure.  But to threaten to take away support would be abuse.", "We don't know what her contributions are.  He doesn't mention them.  Maybe he prefers she doesn't work? Maybe she volunteers in the evening? Maybe shes disabled, or maybe she was recently fired.  Maybe she has rich parents and never needs a job.  We don't know.\n\nMy whole point js that sleep disorders are a real, very common thing, and having a full time job may not regulate it.  She's still TA because regardless what her sleep patterns are, waking him up each night for a fashion show is not acceptable.", "This is simply untrue about Bipolar as a generalized whole. Maybe for many or most, but definitely not how it works for tons diagnosed and living with this (re: cycle lengths, patterns, etc.)"]}
