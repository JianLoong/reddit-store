Recently my sister has gotten into drugs and excessive drinking with friends. The apartment she was renting kicked her out a few months back and I let her stay with me for a bit. However when she threw a giant house party while I was at a business trip I told her she needed to look for somewhere else to stay. Recently she was involved in a car accident. She lost her recently rented apartment because she couldn't afford to pay rent and asked if she could stay with me. For context both of our parents (divorced) told her she could stay with them but she told them both that she had already made arrangements with me without actually asking me. My parents think it is selfish not to help her in her time of need but she has done this all her life where she makes giant mistakes and expects everyone to drop everything for her. \n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1678026361, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11iydex/aita_for_refusing_to_let_my_sister_stay_at_my/", "score": 99, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You gave her a chance and she broke your trust. You are not required to give her a second opportunity. She has other options so you aren\u2019t leaving her homeless.", "NTA. Choose yourself first. In my opinion, if you have talked with your sister already about this and she's not able to solve her problems, you are not the problem,  you have your own life sweetie", ">For context both of our parents (divorced) told her she could stay with them but she told them both that she had already made arrangements with me without actually asking me.\n\nNTA. She has other safe places to stay. She just doesn't want to be monitored by your parents. In no way, shape or form are you obligated to take care of her", "Oh hell to the no. Do not let her stay with you. I am considerably older than you and have more than a decade of experience dealing with an irresponsible sibling who can't get their shit together.\n\nIT. GETS. WORSE.\n\nPut your foot down right now and make it clear to her that you will not clean up her messes or you will be stuck dealing with this for the rest of your life. I've seen it. I lived it.\n\nThe only sensible words a Reagan every uttered: \"Just say no.\"\n\nNTA.", "NTA you're not her parent and she has other options. She's shown you she can't be trusted in your place so if she doesn't want to live with mom or dad like a little kid she should start acting like an adult.", "NTA.  She obviously can't be trusted based on past/current behavior.  Tell your parents that she will not be staying with you.", "NTA. You already gave her a chance to stay with you. She blew it. Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.", "NTA\nYou already got burned once by her with her house party. Let her move in with one of your parents.", "NTA. It's not the job of the responsible daughter to always be the one making sacrifices. Your parents offered, let her take them up on it. You tried, she threw a party and made her bed. She needs to learn to deal with the consequences.", "Nope nope nope she can stay with parents! You\u2019ve been on this merry go round already and it sucked. If mom and dad couldn\u2019t help I\u2019d understand feeling obligated but you are not\u2014 NTA. Roommates suck even worse when they\u2019re related", "NTA\n\nShe's played the stupid game and won the stupid prizes. Why should you risk your own good standing with your landlord (assuming you rent too) by letting a proven bad tenant share your space?\n\nYour parents might be part of the problem for thinking it is YOU who are selfish. Yikes that might explain why she pulls the shit she does thinking its fine to do so.", "NTA. The reason why she doesn\u2019t want to stay with her parents is because they\u2019ll probably enforce stricter boundaries on her. Do not let her live with you again, OP; then you\u2019ll be the one kicked out and asking your parents for a place to stay.", "NTA. Just the drug use alone would be a hard no for me. I don\u2019t know where in the world you are located but where I come from, if a household is known for having a certain amount of drugs at the house, not only the owner of the stuff can get arrested but the mayor of the city or town can decide that everyone who lives there is no longer allowed in that house for a few months and it gets temporary locked down by the police. Even if the housemates knew nothing about it. Even if that\u2019s not a thing where you come from, drug using can attract a whole lot of other issues including aggressive dealers who do not like unpaid debts. Don\u2019t do it. Your sister can stay with one of your parents and won\u2019t be homeless, she just prefers to stay with you because likely she feels there are less rules.", "NTA. After the house party thing, which could have gotten you evicted, it\u2019s understandable to not want her there. She\u2019s a terrible guest. She has options.", "You chucked her out once.. if she went back to the apartments she's been chucked out of, how many would be willing to let her move back in? None. Both the parents have offered her a place, she's not homeless. Stick to your decision , you don't owe her your home . NTA", "NTA. She has 2 other options so she won\u2019t be without a place to stay", "NTA. She's broken trust with you already. And mom and dad have offered her a place to stay.", "NTA she lied that\u2019s on her. Tell your parents they\u2019re selfish for not wanting to help out their daughter and always favoring the golden child.", "NTA. Don't let her in your house. She sounds like trouble", "NTA. You are not responsible for your sister, and you should not be made to feel bad about not taking her in. You may be enabling her behavior by letting her stay, and that can be just as detrimental to her.", "NTA.  She doesn\u2019t want to live with the parents because they will definitely not allow this behavior.  You shouldn\u2019t let her live with you either.  She\u2019s an adult and can figure out how to deal with the consequences of her own (continuous) bad choices on her own.", "Nta. You have done more them your part trying to help her in the past. \n\n>For context both of our parents (divorced) told her she could stay with them but she told them both that she had already made arrangements with me without actually asking me.\n\n That her trying to manipulate you into letting her stay.\n\n\n>My parents think it is selfish not to help her in her time of need but she has done this all her life where she makes giant mistakes and expects everyone to drop everything for her. \n\n The THEY can help her", "NTA. She's family played out when she had the house party. Mom and dad can take her or pay for her to live elsewhere. But she's family is not a reason to back down. Stand your ground.", "NTA but if she still has a key to your place, change the locks. Otherwise she'll show up with her bags and insist on staying.", "One of my fave cliches applies here\u2026\u201ddon\u2019t set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm.\u201d\n\nNTA", "NTA! Will she learn to be responsible at 28yo? Doubtful. Must you let her abuse your generosity? Absolutely not. Sounds like she's got to learn the hard way.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
