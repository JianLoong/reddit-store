(NTA, btw.)\n\nMay I gently suggest you consider either researching support groups for families of addicts, and/or (if you don\u2019t already chat with one already!) finding yourself a counselor that you can speak to about your experiences?\n\nI truly hope this is a blip in your sisters life, and your own, but if it\u2019s not - those things can make a big difference (for both you and your sister.)\n\nI come from a family that has a lot of addiction issues. Some more functional than others. I\u2019ve lost a few close family members to their addictions - and been there to watch it unravel, and try and sort out sadness and guilt and anger and everything else.\n\nMy big sister was one of them (I\u2019m 37, she would have been 54 this year). She struggled off and on with alcohol for most of her life but it got really bad when I was in my late teens. I didn\u2019t fully realize it at first, just had some really unsettling interactions here and there. Then came the money borrowing and lots of lies and living with my parents when she hit bottom and back and forth - and screwing our parents over a ton. They struggled to figure out what was help and what wasn\u2019t. I eventually refused to be in contact with her and ignored her - she had fucked our parents over and hurt them too much. She\u2019d reach out and I wouldn\u2019t respond. Eventually her health took a turn and it became clear that she may not have that much longer left. I agreed to see her. I\u2019m so glad I did. It was the last time I\u2019d ever see her. A year or so later got a call that she was found unconscious after a bender, flown to the hospital. We flew across the country to be there - she was brain dead and doctors had little to no hope she\u2019d come back. We stayed there with her and eventually chose to let her pass on. The last voicemail I have on my phone from her was a call I ignored, and it was just her telling me she loved me. I know I couldn\u2019t have changed how it all ended. And I know that I needed to protect me. But it\u2019s all really, really hard. And if I could change something I would have acknowledged that and gotten help and support from a professional a long time ago to help me manage it, and my relationship with her.\n\nThat\u2019s a scary dramatic story. That isn\u2019t everyone\u2019s story. But counselors and professionals are amazing resources, and addiction is a real thing.", "Go look in the mirror and say \"F Yes I Can! I CHOOSE me!

She continually served me up to others that abused me (not sexually, per se. But stuff that would keep me broken and dependant and not loved just for being me) even after I relented & we talked through ALL the history. \n\nShe did it again in less than a year.\n\nI will be sad for her adult children and will do anything they ask to help THEM.\n\nThat's not me being callous or selfish, that's me putting my oxygen mask on first and it's me making ME the priority in my life.\n\nNo regrets, except that she consistently chose crappy family power dynamic bs over a sister who loved her unconditionally.\n\nSo no GUILT.

I'd actually go one further and send her a firm but loving message that you care deeply for her, and because of that until she gets her act together there will be zero material help. No money, no crash pad, no net. It's going to make her angry. But it could save her life. I tell you this as a child of a severe alcoholic who was bailed out over and over again til he died alone, and most of his family, myself included,  didn't care. She can have better.
