Even if the housemates knew nothing about it. Even if that\u2019s not a thing where you come from, drug using can attract a whole lot of other issues including aggressive dealers who do not like unpaid debts. Don\u2019t do it.

Around you, that dynamic is not there. Your sister will feel like an equal who doesn't have to obey.

Not to shame your parents but judging by their response, it sounds like they are enabling her. The fact alone that she threw a party while you were away shows she does not respect that this is your home and you make the rules and shows exactly where her head is at right now. It honestly sounds like your sister needs to grow up soon and your parents are doing her no favors by enabling her to continue to be irresponsible. We all have times where we are down on our luck in life but it seems like she is living a destructive lifestyle and it is entirely her fault she has ended up in this position.
