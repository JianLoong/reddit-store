I'm not a vegan, but I'm open to trying new things and learning about different lifestyles. However, things took a turn when we went out to dinner with his friends at a fancy steakhouse.\n\nI was excited to try the restaurant's famous steak, but my boyfriend got upset and told me that I was disrespecting his beliefs by eating meat in front of him. He asked me to order something vegan instead, but I refused, saying that I wanted to try the steak. He then proceeded to berate me in front of his friends, telling me that I was supporting animal cruelty and that I didn't care about his feelings.\n\nI felt embarrassed and humiliated by his behavior, but I still ate the steak because I didn't want to be rude to the restaurant or waste food. My boyfriend didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and has been giving me the silent treatment ever since.\n\nNow, I'm left wondering if I was the asshole for not respecting my boyfriend's vegan beliefs and eating meat in front of him. On the one hand, I feel like I have the right to eat whatever I want, especially at a restaurant that I paid for. On the other hand, maybe I should have been more considerate of his feelings and ordered something vegan instead. What do you think, Reddit?
