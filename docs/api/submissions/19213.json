It took him awhile to introduce me to his family but once he did I hit it off really good with his mom and his sister, until the more we hung out, the more offensive jokes his sister would make about my appearance.\n\nIt\u2019s also important for me to note that I always found my boyfriends relationship with his sister really weird. When we would all hang out, she would sit on his lap, play with his hair, and compliment him an unnatural amount. It felt like I was third wheeling sometimes and it made me extremely uncomfortable. I never told my boyfriend because he\u2019d call me crazy. I told myself that other people have different dynamics with their siblings and shrugged it off, I convinced myself it was normal.\n\nA couple nights ago she came over with her friend so the four of us could play poker and hang out. It was going fine until she started making those jokes again and acting really \u201cpick me\u201d with my boyfriend which is so weird, they\u2019re related and it grossed me out. She made a random joke about there being some stuff on the floor because I couldn\u2019t bend over to clean because of my stomach fat. I managed to hold my tears in when I saw that my boyfriend tried not to laugh at it. Im not plus size, Im 130lb.\n\nAn hour later we were casually discussing life and I told her and her friend that I went to a college that some people consider \u201clow brow\u201d because of the easy acceptance rate. She told me that shocked her and I asked what she meant. She literally said \u201cbecause you\u2019re you know\u201d and then pulled her eyes back. i\u2019m korean and I never thought I\u2019d hear a joke like that after high school. It enraged me, I stood up and told her and her friend to shut up and stop laughing. My bf told me to calm down but this made me angrier.\n\nI yelled at her and told her that she\u2019s been hurting my feelings the whole time I\u2019ve known her and that it needs to stop. She looked at me like I was crazy and told me she was just kidding, lighten up. I said it\u2019s not funny if it\u2019s at my expense. I screamed for them to get out because they kept making faces to each other acting like I was insane or something. She sort of cried a little and left while her friend comforted her. \n\nLater on I argued with my boyfriend because he said I went too far. We got over it and he\u2019s not mad at me anymore but Im still annoyed with him because he never stood up for me once. I found out through him that his sister and his mom have been talking bad about me. Im so upset. I should\u2019ve been the bigger person but I let my emotions get the best of me, I feel like a huge AH. I feel like I overreacted and should\u2019ve just kept my mouth shut.\n\n(added in) understand why people are shitting on my boyfriend for his unfair behavior, I\u2019m mad at him too. But I do want to make it clear that though he\u2019s often never on a specific side or has a strong opinion, he has very much been there for me. Whenever I complain about conflict or am upset about my trauma, he\u2019s always been there for me. That\u2019s exactly why this is so hard for me. I\u2019m sure most of you have been in a relationship, so you can understand how it\u2019s scary to leave someone that you value so much. Btw he didn\u2019t laugh at the racist joke his face actually indicated that he was offended too he just didn\u2019t say anything. He only laughed at the fat joke, still bad tho", "created_utc": 1686153380, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/143h08v/aita_for_kicking_out_my_boyfriends_sister_after/", "score": 266, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Let me be as clear as possible so you understand the seriousness of the situation.  Your sister doesn't get to make fun of my appearance or say/do racist shit like doing slanty eyes.

Being the bigger person is good on a one time or limited basis, when confronted time and again by the same person, on basically the same subject and having the same bf ignore your needs.

ESPECIALLY IN YOUR HOME! Your BF is kind of an AH too for not standing up to his sister's jerky behavior. I would honestly run from that whole family. If she's obsessed with your bf, she's going to be obsessed forever and who knows what kind of weird relationship they have. I think she deserved much worse and I wouldn't spend ANY time with her moving forward and certainly not let her back into my home.

Your boyfriend not supporting you is a massive red flag.", "Nope NTA and don\u2019t let your boyfriend convince you that you are! \n\nHis sister is making racist and body shaming comments - these are not jokes, they are insults.

Why are you with your bf? Him letting his family treat you like this is NOT ok. It doesn\u2019t matter if you went to a school that accepts everyone, or a clown college.

Believe me.", "NTA\nYour boyfriend sucks, his sister sucks and her friend also sucks.\nIf he hasnt stood up for you by now, he never will.\n\nIf i were you, id slip in an incest joke next time you see her.

It's understandable that you reached a breaking point and asked your boyfriend's sister to leave after enduring a pattern of offensive jokes and insults, who would not, in your own home.

What a pathetic excuse for a man.", "NTA she made racist jokes in your own home. She's very clingy and possessive over her brother and he needs to recognise that before it breaks you two up and every future relationship he has", "NTA. His sister treating you horribly is bad enough but him sticking up for her instead of you is worse. This is a HUGE red flag that he chooses to defend someone that isn't kind to you. You deserve better.", "NTA. You should not have to be insulted in your own home. Your boyfriend should defend you against racist and body shaming remarks.", "You didn't over react at all.

If this the behavior you want from someone that you love?\n\nNTA.", "Never ever be the bigger person; that\u2019s a weasel excuse for making the victim do all the work of calming a situation.

Not for one fucking second. Don't you dare think that you have to be the bigger person to someone who is bodyshaming you (for what, I don't fucking know. I'm 5'even and 135 lbs and not even chunky). As if that's not bad enough, she is a fucking racist too!!!! And was actively being racist. Never be the bigger person when racism is involved. She's a bully.

First, His sister will never change.  She will always be racist and rude.  Do you want children to be raised with an aunt that calls them and their mom racial slurs? Will he stand up for his kids if this happens.  He had to suppress his laughter when it happened to you. Second is the physical relationship between the two of them.  This is not normal at all.  For her to sit in his lap and play with his hair?  WTF do they do behind closed doors?  Sorry by someone had to ask this.  Get out while you can.", "NTA.  Screw being the bigger person.  She was rude and hurtful and your boyfriend got mad at you for defending yourself.  His family talks about you behind your back and I'm sure he is not defending you then either.

Basically, that's  the same as home saying those things to you, and he doubled down when he said you over reacted.  You don't have issues with his sister as much as you have boyfriend issues.  And her behavior with him and his acceptance of it is NOT normal.  That's like boyfriend and girlfriend behavior. \n\nGet you cash together, split any shared accounts and make an exit plan,  then get some counseling for your self esteem issues from all the bullying.", "NTA and frankly, it doesn\u2019t matter that your bf is there for you while you complain in private, if he\u2019s not standing up for you in public while his sister is constantly insulting you. He has nothing to lose or gain by lending a sympathetic ear. What matters is what he does when someone is insulting and disrespecting you.. and what he does is nothing. In fact, he holds back his laughter and actively lands on her side when he sits back and allows it. He says nothing to her all those times she\u2019s insulted you and you\u2019ve stayed quiet.

Thanks!\"\n\nAND do not invite her over again!  Tell your spineless BF you will not tolerate this any longer - she either apologizes and stops the crap OR she is in a time-out until she does.  If he invites her over - you either leave or you tell him \"no\" and do not open the door for her.  If he tries to get you to go to his Mom's, refuse to go.  \n\nPersonally I think you need to re-examine your dependence on BF.  He \"supports\" you behind the scenes but not in front of his family?  That isn't support, it's cowardice.  He is a coward, he allows his sister to treat/talk about you poorly, and he allows her to fawn all over him like a lover.  That is disgusting.

Lately I do feel like a punching bag, for this weird fucking family.", "No I\u2019m definitely leaning toward breaking up with him but I\u2019m just trying to express how hard this is for me, I\u2019m of course not just gonna be like \u201cWOOO HOT GIRL SUMMER IM FINALLY SINGLE\u201d Like, no.", "I am not secure. With being alone sure I am. But in other corners of life I\u2019m not. I can admit that even though it was already obvious", "I definitely don\u2019t think it\u2019s okay, that\u2019s why I\u2019m here and that\u2019s why we argued over it. I just have a very complicated and layered dynamic with him. But you\u2019re right, I do need to work on my self esteem, because if I didn\u2019t have an issue with it, I wouldn\u2019t feel like the biggest asshole in the world for being bothered by all of this", "Bingo! That\u2019s where I think a dog or animal would be good. Perhaps that type of love and trust has to be relearned.", "No", "I talk to my therapist about this A LOOOOT. I always tell her \u201cif someone talked to me the way that I talked to myself, I\u2019d be in prison\u201d it\u2019s so weird how our brains work. Thank you for the input", "Ok but you said that your life was better before. He doesn\u2019t add value to your life. He makes it worse. \n\nWhat would you tell your sister to do?", "It's going to be more painful if you stay in a relationship that's not good for you. You'll never get this time back and you deserve a partner who values you and respects you. Unfortunately it takes time to truly know someone and so its easy to get caught up in an ideal. But he's shown you who he is and now you have to make a decision as to whether or not you want to settle for this.", "You're 20, you'll be fine. You don't even know what a long term relationship is yet.  Don't hitch your wagon to a family of assholes.", "you need to ditch this alabama freakshow. you're still young, you have plenty of time to find a man who isn't fucking his racist sister", "A man who refuses to see why it's wrong is no better than a man who would break up with you for defending yourself/raising your concerns to him. If you end things over this, you won't be wrong for it. Not even a little. But this is a conversation that *needs* to be had, otherwise you'll be dealing with this abuse for the rest of your life.", "Not picking a side in this instance is actually picking a side - his sister's. You deserve better.", "He is picking sides by not defending you though. And allowing his sister to continue with inappropriate behaviour in front if you is also disrespectful to you and your relationship.", ">you value them for who they are and what they\u2019ve shown you\n\nand that's why you value a boyfriend who allows his sister to get all Cersei on him and doesn't mind her being racist as hell?", "and nobody is expecting you to, just don\u2019t get hung up on the pain of losing him because there will be many more experiences that are way more fulfilling. and that\u2019s a general statement it doesn\u2019t have to be in regards to relationships necessarily", "Omfg I would tell her to RUN. But I think that\u2019s because if you\u2019re outside of someone\u2019s relationship, you can\u2019t really understand the bad AND the good parts. Sometimes the bad parts scream louder than the good parts which I find unfortunate.", "This is true. Many people have been together most of their lives. Now that\u2019s a long term relationship. I cant see myself growing old with this guy. That might be a sign that this will end soon.", "I hate to admit that this made me actually laugh", "You can have the most delicious buns and if there\u2019s shit in the middle, you\u2019re still eating a shit sandwich. \n\nGoogle Lundy Bancroft\u2019s Why Does He Do That? and read the free PDF. See if any of it sounds familiar.", "What good parts?", "Literally everything else. This is our first fight, ever. Sometimes we\u2019d disagree on household stuff but we always say \u201cagree to disagree\u201d because we learned to just respect each other. He\u2019s clean, he\u2019s kind, he\u2019s curious, and it feels like I could never get bored of him and vice versa. I\u2019ve never felt this way about someone so it sucks major that the apparent illusion is falling apart", "Honey, if he can sit and laugh at his sister being overtly racist to you in your own home then he is NOT kind. Actually he's kind of weak and racist himself. \n\nI'm sorry you believe he's better than he is but look at this objectively. You deserve better than him, regardless of how highly you think of him.", "I'm just telling you that I don't think he respects you all that much if he won't tell his sister to stop acting racist.  She will probably always BE racist,  but maybe she could hold it in while you're around. \n\n\nBut furthermore,  if someone called me fat and my partner didn't tell them to stop or throw them out,  I'd dump them. Even if the only benefit is never seeing AH relatives again. \n\nNot that moving out is easy.  But in my 20s, I put up with way too much soul killing BS. I'm hoping to save you since I can't go back and save younger me.", "I AM fat, and my Husband would have serious words with anyone who thought it was okay to call me fat in front of him!"]}
