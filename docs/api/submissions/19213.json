It took him awhile to introduce me to his family but once he did I hit it off really good with his mom and his sister, until the more we hung out, the more offensive jokes his sister would make about my appearance.\n\nIt\u2019s also important for me to note that I always found my boyfriends relationship with his sister really weird. When we would all hang out, she would sit on his lap, play with his hair, and compliment him an unnatural amount. It felt like I was third wheeling sometimes and it made me extremely uncomfortable. I never told my boyfriend because he\u2019d call me crazy. I told myself that other people have different dynamics with their siblings and shrugged it off, I convinced myself it was normal.\n\nA couple nights ago she came over with her friend so the four of us could play poker and hang out. It was going fine until she started making those jokes again and acting really \u201cpick me\u201d with my boyfriend which is so weird, they\u2019re related and it grossed me out. She made a random joke about there being some stuff on the floor because I couldn\u2019t bend over to clean because of my stomach fat. I managed to hold my tears in when I saw that my boyfriend tried not to laugh at it. Im not plus size, Im 130lb.\n\nAn hour later we were casually discussing life and I told her and her friend that I went to a college that some people consider \u201clow brow\u201d because of the easy acceptance rate. She told me that shocked her and I asked what she meant. She literally said \u201cbecause you\u2019re you know\u201d and then pulled her eyes back. i\u2019m korean and I never thought I\u2019d hear a joke like that after high school. It enraged me, I stood up and told her and her friend to shut up and stop laughing. My bf told me to calm down but this made me angrier.\n\nI yelled at her and told her that she\u2019s been hurting my feelings the whole time I\u2019ve known her and that it needs to stop. She looked at me like I was crazy and told me she was just kidding, lighten up. I said it\u2019s not funny if it\u2019s at my expense. I screamed for them to get out because they kept making faces to each other acting like I was insane or something. She sort of cried a little and left while her friend comforted her. \n\nLater on I argued with my boyfriend because he said I went too far. We got over it and he\u2019s not mad at me anymore but Im still annoyed with him because he never stood up for me once. I found out through him that his sister and his mom have been talking bad about me. Im so upset. I should\u2019ve been the bigger person but I let my emotions get the best of me, I feel like a huge AH. I feel like I overreacted and should\u2019ve just kept my mouth shut.\n\n(added in) understand why people are shitting on my boyfriend for his unfair behavior, I\u2019m mad at him too. But I do want to make it clear that though he\u2019s often never on a specific side or has a strong opinion, he has very much been there for me. Whenever I complain about conflict or am upset about my trauma, he\u2019s always been there for me. That\u2019s exactly why this is so hard for me. I\u2019m sure most of you have been in a relationship, so you can understand how it\u2019s scary to leave someone that you value so much. Btw he didn\u2019t laugh at the racist joke his face actually indicated that he was offended too he just didn\u2019t say anything. He only laughed at the fat joke, still bad tho\n(added in) I\u2019m gonna talk to him tonight even though I\u2019m really scared. I\u2019ll try to keep this updated. Additionally can we stop shitting all over me? This just now blew up in my face and I\u2019m trying to find out a way to deal with it.

ESPECIALLY IN YOUR HOME! Your BF is kind of an AH too for not standing up to his sister's jerky behavior. I would honestly run from that whole family. If she's obsessed with your bf, she's going to be obsessed forever and who knows what kind of weird relationship they have.

Why are you with your bf? Him letting his family treat you like this is NOT ok. It doesn\u2019t matter if you went to a school that accepts everyone, or a clown college.

She's very clingy and possessive over her brother and he needs to recognise that before it breaks you two up and every future relationship he has", "NTA.

First, His sister will never change.  She will always be racist and rude.  Do you want children to be raised with an aunt that calls them and their mom racial slurs?

He has nothing to lose or gain by lending a sympathetic ear. What matters is what he does when someone is insulting and disrespecting you.. and what he does is nothing. In fact, he holds back his laughter and actively lands on her side when he sits back and allows it. He says nothing to her all those times she\u2019s insulted you and you\u2019ve stayed quiet.

If he tries to get you to go to his Mom's, refuse to go.  \n\nPersonally I think you need to re-examine your dependence on BF.  He \"supports\" you behind the scenes but not in front of his family?  That isn't support, it's cowardice.  He is a coward, he allows his sister to treat/talk about you poorly, and he allows her to fawn all over him like a lover.  That is disgusting.

I screamed for them to get out because they kept making faces to each other acting like I was insane or something. She sort of cried a little and left while her friend comforted her. \n\nLater on I argued with my boyfriend because he said I went too far. We got over it and he\u2019s not mad at me anymore but Im still annoyed with him because he never stood up for me once.

I had a totally different but same time kinda similar issue with my boyfriend some time ago: He build a metaphorical wall around himself in order not to be \"unmanly\" or be stressed out (or feel anything, really). That's why he also avoided conflict (with family, friends, me,... everyone.). This lead to two things:\n\n1rst: since he closed himself off from being available for feelings, he didn't just let his feelings pass, but mine and everyone elses as well. So he didn't even realise when someone close to him was upset.\n\n2nd: He ignored all his feelings until they boiled up. Then he exploded in an emotionally extreme (and often irrational and unfair) manner, which he always felt bad for afterwards. That's why he also would get super stressed out if he couldn't avoid confrontation as usual.\n\nSo here's my guess: Your bf might not have the same reasons to act like the man from my story.

So I sticked around trying to make him see my point, until I couldn't anymore. I actually broke up with him which put him to his \"lowest point\" and forced him to reflect on all of this. He changed, apologized and was able to actually explain what was going on and why he'd see now that things were bad the way they were. He's very open to communication now, made hughe efforts regarding self-improvement and mental health and became much more aware of his behaviour and the feelings of the people around him. Needless to say, we're back together. \n\nHe kept asking me (and still does sometimes), how I managed to stay with him for that long while he behaved like that. He said he probably even wouldn't. And while I love him and care for him and know that he has it in him, he still has a point: no-one should stay with someone just for the hopes of getting better eventually.
