She is here for study on scholarship. \n\nFor context, she is my only sibling (older). My family has always bent over backwards to help her on her various endeavours and her MANY moves, however she is a bit of a \u201ctaker\u201d. I feel she just kind of expects the help, many times over the years I\u2019ve helped her with various things big and small and have had to prompt her to say thanks.\n\nSo the issue: \nShe arrived in late at night, so of course I said I would pick her up and she could stay with us until she moved into her new place a few days later. I picked her up (I live an hour away from the airport) and drove her home (no \u201cthanks for picking me up\u201d but I figured she was just tired) then I had to get up early and go right back to work. \n\nFor the next few days I drove her round, made her dinners, told her she was welcome to any food in our house, helped her get all the things she needed, and again drove all of her stuff an hour away to help move her in to her place because she\u2019s my sister and I love her.\n\nOne day we got lunch and they couldn\u2019t split the bill so she paid and I said I\u2019d transfer her the $20 for my share. I forgot and she asked me the next day if I had transferred the money. I guess i should have just said nothing and sent it, but I was feeling a bit unappreciated as I had already spent hundreds in fuel and food + days of my time to help her get settled. I suggested that maybe she could get lunch since I\u2019d been covering all the petrol and had been feeding/accommodating her. I\u2019d also given her lots of homeware to use while she\u2019s here to save her some money.\n\nShe got immediately defensive and said she \u201cwould but couldn\u2019t afford to because she\u2019s on SUCH a tight budget\u201d. She also kept saying that I was the one who said I would transfer her the money. I was honestly pretty upset because the day before she had bought $500 worth of stuff to set herself up.. which is fair except she\u2019d happily buy more expensive options because she liked the colour or whatever. She\u2019s also just gotten back from a trip by herself that cost thousands, and has been staying with family for free so hasn\u2019t had any rent. \n\nShe bought it up again half an hour later as she could tell I was still upset. Her words were: \u201cin future, please don\u2019t offer to help or pay for something if you\u2019re not comfortable with it or don\u2019t want to\u201d. I\u2019ve tried to explain that it\u2019s not about the money but that I feel a bit unappreciated as so far I haven\u2019t even had a genuine \u201cthank you\u201d for all the help. Her response is just \u201cOF COURSE I\u2019m grateful, it goes without saying\u201d. \n\nI\u2019ve paid, but AITA for suggesting she cover it? I didn\u2019t help her to get anything in return, but is it selfish that I thought she might be a little more grateful?", "created_utc": 1667174550, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yhuqvr/aita_for_being_upset_over_20/", "score": 10, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'd been best friends with a \"taker\" for years and at some point I realised I was enabling her to take advantage of me. You were not wrong to ask or to feel annoyed when she wouldn't cover the bill. I would just refrain from helping her out so much in the future.

I did pay of course, as I said it wasn\u2019t about the money and i will always cover my share of anything. I guess I just suggested it thinking it might be an easy way for her to say thanks since she never seems comfortable actually saying it - if situations were reversed I would have told her I\u2019d be happy to cover it but maybe that\u2019s naive.", "Thanks - that\u2019s just it though: she is 33, has lived independently since she was 18. She\u2019s lived in several different countries, in fact she had no qualms about going to live on the other side of the world for a year when she was in high school (exchange program thing). She shows no hesitancy to do whatever she wants to do, and is not emotionally reliant on being near family, but has always been able to get our whole family to help her whenever she needs it. Our family are kind people and happy to help, my stepdad is selling her car for her back in our home country so she could use it right up until she left, she seemed annoyed yesterday that he hasn\u2019t listed it yet. \n\nShe\u2019s got a great career, is highly educated, well travelled, independent etc etc.. but lives an almost completely self serving existence and has never had a long term partner or had to compromise any of her wants for anyone. \n\nWhen we lived together she would get angry at me for leaving something small on the floor, only for me to come home and have to step over some enormous project of hers covering the whole lounge. \n\nI also cannot remember a single time in my life where she has ever done something nice for me just because she\u2019s my sister - she also will never compliment or congratulate me, nor will she show much interest in my life despite me doing all of the aforementioned things for her. She talks almost exclusively about things SHE is interested in, or herself. \n\nEven though I was excited to have her move here, a part of me was quietly a little bit disappointed when she got this scholarship and said she\u2019d be coming. Ive been enjoying the relationship from a bit of a distance, and just seeing her a few times a year. I would never tell my family this of course.", "I really don\u2019t think so.

Yes)\n\nEvery single time she gets defensive and responds with \u201cI was literally JUST about to say thank you\u201d\u2026 yet the times I\u2019ve said nothing I have never received a thanks \ud83d\ude43", "I appreciate your perspective - as I said, I absolutely did transfer her the $20 as soon as we had that conversation. I wasn\u2019t trying to get out of paying, and it wasn\u2019t that I expected something back, it was just an offhand suggestion that maybe she could cover it since I\u2019d been paying for so many things to help her. \n\nHonestly if there had been any kind of verbal \u201cthank you for helping me with everything\u201d so far I wouldn\u2019t have suggested it, so maybe it was partly out of frustration. \n\nGenuinely I\u2019ve put so much time, effort, and money in to make sure her move is as easy as possible and, while I didn\u2019t expect any payment or gesture in return, I didn\u2019t expect to not even be thanked. \n\nYou are completely correct though, I cannot change how anyone else feels or shows gratitude and I will remember her reaction to all of this when she wants help in the future, because I know she will.", "I didn\u2019t back out of it, I sent her the money right after the conversation when it was clear she didn\u2019t want to cover it despite all the help and money I\u2019d spent. \n\nI genuinely made the comment offhand thinking she\u2019d see it as an easy, low effort way to say thanks. While I would never help someone for the sake of receiving something in return, I\u2019ve never in my life let someone go out of their way for me (family or not) without being either extremely vocally appreciative and doing something to say thanks. She did neither.

I had a moment of near-hysteria because after we got back in the car she told me \u201cthat muesli you have is on sale for really cheap if you wanted to get some more\u201d. I asked if mine was almost run out and she said yes, that she only used a tiny bit for breakfast yesterday because she \u201cdidn\u2019t want to use it up\u201d. \n\n- I got home and checked, she left about 2 tablespoons in the bag so not even enough for me to have half a breakfast\n- I reflected and realised she saw it and TOLD me it was on sale/cheap and let me know in case I wanted to go BACK INSIDE AND BUY MORE\u2026 instead of just buying it to replace what she has eaten over the last few days. \n\nYou are right. I cannot keep doing this.", "This is a great example that you teach others how to treat you.  You will need to hold the line with her for any hope that she will eventually mature into a more considerate person, at least with you. \n\nUnfortunately, it will get harder before it gets easier.  Much better to teach these lessons when a person is a child since the tantrums can be pretty epic when adults have to learn them.", "Ugh", "Geez. Throw the whole woman away. She's toxic."]}
