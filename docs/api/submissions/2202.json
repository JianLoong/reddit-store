Ride in a car without a seat belt? Be outside on their own until nightfall? They're 5 and 2, not 13\".\nShe also had gone on to say that \"back in my day we didn't hear about all these allergies, they didn't exist, and visits to the doctor were very rare\". Again, in the fucking sixties! Jesus christ, people still believed cocaine was medicinal.\nI also brought up the fact that she once lost me for hours as a child, she was attacked by a dog when she was a child because she was unsupervised. But yet she sits there and judges my parenting for actually wanting to be around my kids?\nShe started to say that her post wasn't about me or my wife. That she believed we were excellent parents and blah blah blah (why even bring up MY kids in the first place then?) But then she got super angry for the things I said about her mistakes as a parent. Which I wasn't attacking her, but I was highlighting that her standards of safety back then were NOT the right mindset to have.\nWe have an extremely volatile relationship. I have severe CPTSD, and I've tried to maintain a relationship with her solely for my daughters' sake. She steps over every single boundary we set. She disrespects my wife and me as parents constantly, and frankly we distrust her around the kids by herself. A few years ago we let her watch our first daughter while we went to work, only to find that she took her to a town 30 mins away, then to her house, and then back to my home WITHOUT TELLING US, until we came home. That was the last time we had her watch my daughter. Ever since, she's been extremely jealous that my MIL watches the girls ONCE a week while my wife and I work the weekend.\n\nSo after this whole debacle, she made the decision to cut us off completely. Blocked our numbers, and said she will never speak to us again.\nFrankly I'm ok with it, but I'm so hurt that she would make such a decision without even considering how it would affect the kids. Should I not have said anything to her about her damn post?

You're looking for reasons to be angry at your mother. Sounds like there's alot of resentment there. Best thing for you is to get counselling now so that that doesn't spill over onto how you raise your kids. If you're that touchy about your parenting, wait till your kids tell you you're doing things wrong. They all do that at some point. Buckle up. Your mother was right to go no contact. You're irrational and it was inappropriate to go off on her. I hope you find your way to some peace.", ">But yet she sits there and judges my parenting for actually wanting to be around my kids?\n\nI'm confused. Where did she do this? She said \"she felt sorry for her granddaughters (my children) because there were so many things she did that they won't get to experience.\" Where is the judgement of you as a parent?", "It was a fb meme, ffs! Op, are u always this overly sensitive? If I were your mother I'd go NC with u too, you sound exhausting!\n\nEta:  YTA!", "NTA. If it wasn\u2019t that post, then it would\u2019ve been something else down the line. If you\u2019re determined about staying NC even though she initiated it, (and I don\u2019t blame you she sounds terrible), it\u2019s best to do it while the kids are still young. They have another, decent set of grandparents and that\u2019s enough; some don\u2019t even have that. Best of luck, you sound like a great dad and husband.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Obnoxious. I'm not sure it's worth fighting over. If you're worried she would neglect your kids then by all means don't have her babysit.\n\nIt sounds like you and your mom have some deep issues. \n\nESH. That she went NC so quickly seems to indicate that the issues are on both sides.", "YTA.  I can\u2019t imagine suffering through a dinner party with the likes of you two.", "YTA. You\u2019re looking for excuses to hate on her. When she babysat, your baby was safe and sound. If you didn\u2019t want her out of the house you should have said do explicitly. And this FB thing was just that, something some people post. Your wife was definitely fishing for an excuse to pile on the \u201clet\u2019s bash on MIL\u201d train. Wife stalked her facebook, screenshot it (!!) and showed it to you. I can imagine the two of you getting all inflamed, like, \u201cCan you believe the nerve? THE NERVE OF THIS WOMAN POSTING THINGS THAT 60 YEAR OLDS POST ON FACEBOOK! LET\u2019S MAKE IT ABOUT US!\u201d. When you contacted her aggressively and with weak comebacks, she actually told you she believes you\u2019re excellent parents. What else do you want? Let this woman be. I\u2019m with her going NC with you. You just don\u2019t like her and nothing she\u2019ll ever do will be enough for you.", "YTA. Those Facebook posts are really common, and they're meaningless. She probably read it, laughed, shared it and forgot about it. The fact you're taking it as a personal attack is bizarre and unnecessary. \n\nI also don't get why you were so upset that she - gasp! horror! - went out with the baby she was looking after to enable you to work, but that's neither here nor there.", "NTA, as another commentor said if you're going to go NO Contact with your mom it's best while the children are young. Trust me as I wish I'd have done it when mine was young instead of the way it happened. If it's not this it would be a different thing, the not respecting boundaries is a major red flag, it won't get better, it sounds like your mom thinks because she's the grandma and your mom she knows better than you about your own children. Please for your sake and your kids sake stay NC at this point and seek therapy.", "NTA. You don't need that kind of energy from anyone", "They had the whole  \"Turn on, tune in, drop out\" thing as counter culture. But, unless your mom is 80, she probably didn't go to Woodstock and really let it all hang out?\n\nNTA. No way. I don't blame you for being upset that she bothered mentioning your kids in her post. But, the 60s stoners drive BMWs and are the establishment now.  So, your mom is making me laugh because its not like other people don't remember what things were like back in the 60s. She could be reliving somebody else's glory days and not her own? \n\nThings seem tense, but, did she know she was supposed to tell you before driving your baby somewhere? I mean is this really about your FB post?  I think that the world is a different place now than it was 60 years ago and we all know it. I just am having trouble figuring out why your mom was so PO'd with you?", "YTA. It's a generic meme. There are some good things from back then thst kids today will never know. Doesn't sound like your mom was targeting you at all. But you took that as an attack and unloaded all you relationship grievances from there.\n\nYou should apologize for overreacting. And you and mom need therapy if you hope to move on from this.", "NTA - she just added one more thing to the list that she got to do that your kids won't that could potentially harm them: spend time with grandma \ud83d\udc4c", "Nta!", "YTA. Totally. There are lots of memes exactly like that all over Facebook. You and your wife decided to get get upset about something that was not anything to do with you, but, hey, as the saying goes\u2026. If the cap fits, wear it!", "ESH. Your mom for her whole deal. You for not cutting her off before this. And your wife for just having a Facebook account in general.", ">I have severe CPTSD...\n\nYou need to unpack this situation with your therapist.", "Through texts. I'm so sorry I forgot to mention that. I don't even have a Facebook, I just got the screenshot of her post from my wife.", "I've babysat and driven the baby 30 minutes away myself. A parent would have to tell me they didn't want that because no way it would have occurred to me.", "This. I get those posts all the time from older friends.\n\nAnd as someone who was born in the fifties, nobody thought cocaine was medicinal in the sixties. It was a recreational drug. Cocaine was \"medicinal\" decades earlier.", "OP, correct me if I'm wrong here but it seems if your mom was willing to go no contact with you this easily, \"shits been brewing\" for a long time. \n\nIt looks like this triggered, for lack of a better word, your anger in your mother not respecting you or your wishes as a parent. The other information, the car trip, the lack of allergy awareness and other tidbits you threw in. \n\nI think it was a silly fight to pick over Facebook comments, but it was a fight fueled by legitimate anger and concerns that have remainedunaddressed.\n\nNTA but I would definitely look into NPD regarding your mother. They cannot handle criticism and cut ties easily when someone questions their own self image. If that sounds familiar look into it. Good luck"]}
