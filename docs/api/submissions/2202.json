Ride in a car without a seat belt? Be outside on their own until nightfall? They're 5 and 2, not 13\".\nShe also had gone on to say that \"back in my day we didn't hear about all these allergies, they didn't exist, and visits to the doctor were very rare\". Again, in the fucking sixties! Jesus christ, people still believed cocaine was medicinal.\nI also brought up the fact that she once lost me for hours as a child, she was attacked by a dog when she was a child because she was unsupervised. But yet she sits there and judges my parenting for actually wanting to be around my kids?\nShe started to say that her post wasn't about me or my wife. That she believed we were excellent parents and blah blah blah (why even bring up MY kids in the first place then?) But then she got super angry for the things I said about her mistakes as a parent. Which I wasn't attacking her, but I was highlighting that her standards of safety back then were NOT the right mindset to have.\nWe have an extremely volatile relationship. I have severe CPTSD, and I've tried to maintain a relationship with her solely for my daughters' sake. She steps over every single boundary we set. She disrespects my wife and me as parents constantly, and frankly we distrust her around the kids by herself. A few years ago we let her watch our first daughter while we went to work, only to find that she took her to a town 30 mins away, then to her house, and then back to my home WITHOUT TELLING US, until we came home. That was the last time we had her watch my daughter. Ever since, she's been extremely jealous that my MIL watches the girls ONCE a week while my wife and I work the weekend.\n\nSo after this whole debacle, she made the decision to cut us off completely. Blocked our numbers, and said she will never speak to us again.\nFrankly I'm ok with it, but I'm so hurt that she would make such a decision without even considering how it would affect the kids.

You're looking for reasons to be angry at your mother. Sounds like there's alot of resentment there. Best thing for you is to get counselling now so that that doesn't spill over onto how you raise your kids. If you're that touchy about your parenting, wait till your kids tell you you're doing things wrong. They all do that at some point. Buckle up. Your mother was right to go no contact. You're irrational and it was inappropriate to go off on her. I hope you find your way to some peace.", ">But yet she sits there and judges my parenting for actually wanting to be around my kids?\n\nI'm confused. Where did she do this? She said \"she felt sorry for her granddaughters (my children) because there were so many things she did that they won't get to experience.\" Where is the judgement of you as a parent?", "It was a fb meme, ffs!

If it wasn\u2019t that post, then it would\u2019ve been something else down the line. If you\u2019re determined about staying NC even though she initiated it, (and I don\u2019t blame you she sounds terrible), it\u2019s best to do it while the kids are still young.

Obnoxious. I'm not sure it's worth fighting over. If you're worried she would neglect your kids then by all means don't have her babysit.\n\nIt sounds like you and your mom have some deep issues. \n\nESH. That she went NC so quickly seems to indicate that the issues are on both sides.", "YTA.  I can\u2019t imagine suffering through a dinner party with the likes of you two.", "YTA. You\u2019re looking for excuses to hate on her. When she babysat, your baby was safe and sound. If you didn\u2019t want her out of the house you should have said do explicitly. And this FB thing was just that, something some people post. Your wife was definitely fishing for an excuse to pile on the \u201clet\u2019s bash on MIL\u201d train. Wife stalked her facebook, screenshot it (!!) and showed it to you. I can imagine the two of you getting all inflamed, like, \u201cCan you believe the nerve? THE NERVE OF THIS WOMAN POSTING THINGS THAT 60 YEAR OLDS POST ON FACEBOOK! LET\u2019S MAKE IT ABOUT US!\u201d. When you contacted her aggressively and with weak comebacks, she actually told you she believes you\u2019re excellent parents. What else do you want? Let this woman be. I\u2019m with her going NC with you. You just don\u2019t like her and nothing she\u2019ll ever do will be enough for you.", "YTA. Those Facebook posts are really common, and they're meaningless. She probably read it, laughed, shared it and forgot about it. The fact you're taking it as a personal attack is bizarre and unnecessary. \n\nI also don't get why you were so upset that she - gasp! horror! - went out with the baby she was looking after to enable you to work, but that's neither here nor there.", "NTA, as another commentor said if you're going to go NO Contact with your mom it's best while the children are young. Trust me as I wish I'd have done it when mine was young instead of the way it happened. If it's not this it would be a different thing, the not respecting boundaries is a major red flag, it won't get better, it sounds like your mom thinks because she's the grandma and your mom she knows better than you about your own children. Please for your sake and your kids sake stay NC at this point and seek therapy.", "NTA. You don't need that kind of energy from anyone", "They had the whole  \"Turn on, tune in, drop out\" thing as counter culture. But, unless your mom is 80, she probably didn't go to Woodstock and really let it all hang out?\n\nNTA. No way. I don't blame you for being upset that she bothered mentioning your kids in her post. But, the 60s stoners drive BMWs and are the establishment now.  So, your mom is making me laugh because its not like other people don't remember what things were like back in the 60s. She could be reliving somebody else's glory days and not her own? \n\nThings seem tense, but, did she know she was supposed to tell you before driving your baby somewhere? I mean is this really about your FB post?  I think that the world is a different place now than it was 60 years ago and we all know it. I just am having trouble figuring out why your mom was so PO'd with you?", "YTA. It's a generic meme. There are some good things from back then thst kids today will never know. Doesn't sound like your mom was targeting you at all. But you took that as an attack and unloaded all you relationship grievances from there.\n\nYou should apologize for overreacting. And you and mom need therapy if you hope to move on from this.", "NTA - she just added one more thing to the list that she got to do that your kids won't that could potentially harm them: spend time with grandma \ud83d\udc4c", "Nta!", "YTA. Totally. There are lots of memes exactly like that all over Facebook. You and your wife decided to get get upset about something that was not anything to do with you, but, hey, as the saying goes\u2026. If the cap fits, wear it!", "ESH. Your mom for her whole deal. You for not cutting her off before this. And your wife for just having a Facebook account in general.", ">I have severe CPTSD...\n\nYou need to unpack this situation with your therapist.", "Through texts. I'm so sorry I forgot to mention that. I don't even have a Facebook, I just got the screenshot of her post from my wife.", "I've babysat and driven the baby 30 minutes away myself. A parent would have to tell me they didn't want that because no way it would have occurred to me.", "This. I get those posts all the time from older friends.\n\nAnd as someone who was born in the fifties, nobody thought cocaine was medicinal in the sixties. It was a recreational drug. Cocaine was \"medicinal\" decades earlier.", "OP, correct me if I'm wrong here but it seems if your mom was willing to go no contact with you this easily, \"shits been brewing\" for a long time. \n\nIt looks like this triggered, for lack of a better word, your anger in your mother not respecting you or your wishes as a parent. The other information, the car trip, the lack of allergy awareness and other tidbits you threw in. \n\nI think it was a silly fight to pick over Facebook comments, but it was a fight fueled by legitimate anger and concerns that have remainedunaddressed.\n\nNTA but I would definitely look into NPD regarding your mother. They cannot handle criticism and cut ties easily when someone questions their own self image. If that sounds familiar look into it. Good luck", "I will honestly never understand why people keep their shitty family around \"for the kids\". Your mum is shit to you, why do you think she'll be any better to your daughter? What benefit does your daughter get from having your mother around?\n\nLet her cut you off, return the favour in blocking her and just live your life.", "I\u2019m going with NTA. I don\u2019t get all the y-t-a votes. It might have been an overreaction in other families, but you know the relationship dynamics with your family better than any random stranger on the internet. From the sounds of it, you have a complicated relationship with your mother and already had reason not to trust her judgment or intentions. Tbh, you\u2019re probably better off without her in your life, and if she cuts people off this easily, it is much better for your children to get her out now before she causes too much emotional damage.", "NTA", "YTA. My aunt shares those things on Facebook\u2026her kids had car seats & all the modern parenting stuff but her (& the rest of my family) look back at those times fondly specifically going out in the neighborhood at a young age & just playing until the lights went on(then it was time to go home). That\u2019s not even as far back but now people are definitely more cautious about knowing where their kids are & being able to contact them. It\u2019s not a direct insult at your parenting, it\u2019s being nostalgic about the past. \nAs someone whose grandparents watched me while my parents worked, I really don\u2019t understand why her leaving the house is a big deal. I would never assume someone watching a child for a full day was going to never leave the house-I used to walk kids to the playground, I\u2019d go insane with a child home all day. \n\nYou sound exhausting, she may suck too but I\u2019m not getting that from anything you\u2019ve provided here.", "Info: Does she have other grandchildren?", "NTA, I think that the people that voted that you\u00b4re the asshole simply read your post very fast OP. You clearly say that she specifically mensions your children and that she feels sorry for them and that OP **is** personal. Not a simple facebook meme.", "YTA You've completely blown a nostalgic Facebook post out of proportion. It was obviously a commentary on the state of the world, not a personal attack on you.", "YTA. Her fb post was not about you, it was just one of those random things. I'm not even sure you were fair to stop her babysitting because she took her granddaughter somewhere without telling you. Was that a deliberate act of defiance,  or just an assumption that it would be ok. Have the other grandparents never made a mistake?  Does sound like you are directing a lot of anger at her. Is she abusive? Is she cruel? For her to go nc is a major decision and it feels like we are only hearing one side of the story.", "ESH - sounds like there's been bad blood for a while and this just brought it to a head.  Trust me--people in the 60s didn't think cocaine was medicinal.   You never know the true emotional intent of words on a screen, so it's best not to put total trust in the intent behind them.   You sound like a great, caring Dad.  Just don't let the past drag you down.   Take care of your wife and family.", "She wrote on her post that she specifically felt bad for my children because they won't do the things she did as a child. From what she had told me herself from her past, she was grossly neglected as a child. So yeah, because of HER own words, not the meme, I got upset and took it personally.\nAnd we were upset that she took our daughter because she didn't bother to tell us. Again, stepping over boundaries. It's just common courtesy to let the PARENTS know what's going on with their child.", "Op specifically states that their mom said she feels bad for op's kids because they'll never get to do things in that Facebook post.", "Yea cause mentioning she feels sorry for OP kids got nothing to do with them", "Right, so OP\u2019s mom reposts one of those stupid memes with a comment about how society has changed in 80 years and the standards for childcare are different now and OP takes it as a personal attack.  I don\u2019t blame mom for going NC, OP sounds exhausting.  YTA \n\nEdited to add judgement"]}
