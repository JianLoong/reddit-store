I'd say that what you don't want at your wedding is DRAMA, and your mom has set up a boatload of it.  You don't need your dad to find out at your wedding that your mom is seriously dating this man.  Maybe if she told him beforehand that would reduce the drama.  Also, if she wants 5 more people, plus 4 SO's, plus children, will she pay for them?", "It's your wedding. And it isn't cheap to invite people either. You want people you care about and share a bond with to be there, not some randos. Put your foot down. You're already inviting her partner that you don't know that well. Tbh I think that's plenty gracious. \n\nNTA", "You can invite who ever you want to your wedding. This also includes you can not invite whoe ever you don't want to your wedding.\n\nNTA. \n\nJust make sure your not asking mom for anything and you should be just fine. Worst case she decides \"If you don't invite them, I won't go\" and you discover less drama.", "NTA. Weddings should be for family and friends. You don't know these people. If your mother wants to forge bonds with them, she can do so under her own steam.", "NTA... your wedding is for those that you and your husband are close to. That's not them yet. \"Sorry Mom, I'm not inviting people to the wedding that I dont already have a relationship with. This doesnt mean that I dont like them, I look forward to spending more time with them in the future\"", "NTA \nWhy would you invite people you met once? That's odd. Imagine inviting all the people you have met once in your life to you wedding. Not to mention the expense of feeding them. \nI also agree that it could be a shock for your dad, maybe even a bit rude when he doesn't even know she's dating. Not saying its his business but personally that's not something I'd enjoy if Im trying to enjoy my childs wedding. Is your mom in any way trying to show up or dad or put it in his face? It's honestly just an odd request from your mom in my opinion. Don't feel bad for not inviting them. Your wedding is supposed to be a special day for you and your koved ones to celebrate you and your partner. You don't need to feel weird or uncomfortable on your day. It's your wedding not a a carnival where anyone can buy a ticket and come.", "NTA - This is your wedding, you and your fianc\u00e9s day. Invite who you want to invite.", "NTA it's your wedding and you get to decide who comes to your wedding.", "NTA. These people are virtually strangers to you. Tell your mom they\u2019re not going to be invited and don\u2019t let her drag you into a squabble about it. It\u2019s your wedding. If you\u2019re depending on funding from her you may have a difficult choice to make. She already gets an AH label for attempting to inform you who will be invited instead of politely asking.", "NTA. It\u2019s your wedding you can invite who you like but I would just be careful about annoying future family members you may want to have a relationship with. But at the end of the day you have no obligation to invite anyone to your wedding. It\u2019s your day. It should be drama free and happy", "NTA-\n\nYou've known your mom's fiance for less than six months. You've met his kids barely one time... No way you're obligated to invite them to the wedding. It's your wedding. Inviting your mom's fiance is polite. Inviting his whole family, who you don't know, is weird. Her insisting on it is weirder. It's not her wedding. She can invite everyone her wedding.", "NTA.\n\nYou and your spouse-to-be have the final say on the guest list.  \n\nYour mom might complain, but you might be able to use limited space or limited funds as an excuse for leaving the step-siblings off the guest list.", "NTA. It's your wedding - invite who you want. These people belong at her wedding, but you're not obligated to invite them to yours.", "NTA and the fact that your mum wants to get married before you after only dating for 6 months sounds like trouble. Don't share any wedding ideas because people like that steal wedding ideas and wanna one up you. \n\nInvite who you want and don't feel pressure to do that for your mum when she hasnt even made an effort to make you part of that family.", "NTA! It\u2019s your wedding, you should only invite people you want to share the day with.", "NTA\n\nYour wedding. Invite who you want....If they ask why.... It's a numbers thing and you only have room for those people the two of you know and want there and guest list is already done.... But you two look forward to meeting extended family next year ( or whenever timeframe after your wedding)....\n\nAlthough it's weird you're worried about your Dad's reaction to her dating/future husband. They have been divorced 15 years. She has the right to move on with her life.", "NAH (unless your mom's *demanding* you invite them even after you said no\u2014then she becomes the ah)\n\nYou don't need to invite your mom's BOYFRIEND's kids, especially people you've only met once and didn't have a strong connection with (yet). Tell your mom that if she's truly happy, her ex's opinion of her life shouldn't even matter.", "NTA, but what on earth?!  After being divorced 15 years, \"I\u2019m already worried out about my dad seeing my mom with a new husband (he doesn\u2019t even know she\u2019s dating yet) and will be stressed about that,....\"  Tell your dad now that your mom may be getting married.  If he can't deal with seeing them for your wedding after 15 years apart, yeesh, that is all on him.  This is coming from a step parent who has made it to and through the kids' weddings with a very contentious ex without any visible issues.", "NTA \n\nIt's your wedding. Your mother isn't in charge of the guest list. You and your fiance are \n\nYou aren't obligated to invite anyone to your wedding. It doesn't matter if they are a forever relative, family friend, or recently acquired stepsiblings. It's your wedding.\n\nIf it matters, they would probably be as enthusiastic about attending as you would be with inviting them. It's one thing to have a civil, sorta friendly relationship with adult stepsiblings that you don't know, when you see them at your mutual parents home. Inviting to your wedding is another matter.", "NTA. My FIL brought his new wife and all her kids from her first marriage to my wedding and they split up shortly thereafter. They are ALL in our wedding photos and I literally don\u2019t even know their names. Don\u2019t do it.", "NTA\n\nIf she hasn't already started, your mum will be telling these people all about the wedding and to expect an invite, so it's best not to get their hopes up. Otherwise her own invitation to your wedding may be in jeopardy.\n\nLet her know that she needs to give up these very unrealistic expectations NOW.  You don't know if her BFs kids are thinking she's weird for assuming they're invited, or are already planning matching outfits. Who knows what will happen? Her 6 month relationship may fall over by Christmas.", "NTA. Invite who you want.  I ended up with people I didn\u2019t invite because I had family members decide to invite people. People I did want weren\u2019t able to come. Regardless I didn\u2019t care that much as the main thing was getting married!  We had an outdoor wedding with a lunch that I informed everyone they\u2019d be paying for themselves.  But my stepdad paid for it which was amazing!!  But he definitely didn\u2019t need to and it wasn\u2019t an expensive restaurant thankfully.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Should she have stayed single forever", "Yea she doesn't have to go to the wedding", "I agree! I\u2019m sure my mom wants my dad to see she\u2019s happy now. I plan to tell my dad well ahead of the wedding that she\u2019s dating/ getting married because I know she isn\u2019t going to, and I don\u2019t need him pissed off that day. He can process those emotions ahead of time. My parent\u2019s relationship was very bad. My dad was a drug addict and spent time in jail, but he\u2019s changed a lot and has been clean for a long time now.  She will always hate him and she hates that I still have a relationship with my dad and have forgiven him. I\u2019ve already put my foot down that my dad is coming, but he isn\u2019t walking me down the aisle. So I\u2019m trying to set boundaries, but it keeps adding up! Lol", "That\u2019s fair. I mostly just don\u2019t want him showing up, seeing her with someone else and then he\u2019s crabby the rest of the day. This exact scenario happened at my college graduation a few years ago lol", "That's great that you have a relationship with him. I know how hard that can be, for real. I hope your mom can forgive him someday but I can understand too as I'm sure she went through a lot. Hope the best for you all and congrats on your wedding.", "Maybe after 15 years he can be a adult about it", "Okay ... Then your Dad is the problem here. Not your Mom. He can't be mature enough to celebrate you for a few hours without making a scene cause he wants to have a pity party?!? You need to sit him down and explain to him he needs to be in control of himself at your wedding.\n\n\nThat's just embarrassing....and you shouldn't have to exclude people from your wedding because he's the one with an issue.....Your Mom is allowed to live her life and I wouldn't cater to his nonsense as a another way to manipulate her."]}
