She was there for about two hours already.\n\nSo I called my girlfriend (25F) and asked her to please come pick up my niece and take her to my place. We have been dating for about 2 years and my sister knows her (admittedly not particularly well). She came over and picked my niece up. I headed home once I was done with the meeting and they'd had quite a bit of fun together. Unlike me, my girlfriend is quite gracious with kids and she handled everything perfectly.\n\nThe next day I told my sister the whole situation because well, I thought I have to since her daughter was under my care when all this happened.\n\nShe told me I was unbelievable and that I needed to understand that work comes after family and that I should not have left my niece with my girlfriend anyways. I told her she needed to get over herself. She is currently not talking to me.

It\u2019s great things turned out ok, don\u2019t get me wrong, but what if it hadn\u2019t?  What if niece had gotten scared, sick, or hurt or something.
