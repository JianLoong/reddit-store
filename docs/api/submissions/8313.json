I said it wasn't really convenient for me but she insisted so much and I ended up agreeing. \n\nI picked up my niece from my sister's in the evening and was on my way home. I got a call from work saying that there was a problem and that I needed to go back and have an emergency meeting. I called my sister but she was not picking up. I tried her for the third time and she didn't pick up.\n\nSo I took my niece to work with me. She sat in my office, most of my co-workers were kind enough to offer to entertain her from time to time as I was at the meeting. However, they told me she was really bored out of her mind and pretty tired. She was there for about two hours already.\n\nSo I called my girlfriend (25F) and asked her to please come pick up my niece and take her to my place. We have been dating for about 2 years and my sister knows her (admittedly not particularly well). She came over and picked my niece up. I headed home once I was done with the meeting and they'd had quite a bit of fun together. Unlike me, my girlfriend is quite gracious with kids and she handled everything perfectly.\n\nThe next day I told my sister the whole situation because well, I thought I have to since her daughter was under my care when all this happened.\n\nShe told me I was unbelievable and that I needed to understand that work comes after family and that I should not have left my niece with my girlfriend anyways. I told her she needed to get over herself. She is currently not talking to me. She has even involved my brother, who agrees with her and thinks I owe her an apology.\n\nAm I the AH in this situation?", "created_utc": 1674725016, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10lny6w/aita_for_leaving_my_niece_with_my_gf/", "score": 174, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
