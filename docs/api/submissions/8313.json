I said it wasn't really convenient for me but she insisted so much and I ended up agreeing. \n\nI picked up my niece from my sister's in the evening and was on my way home. I got a call from work saying that there was a problem and that I needed to go back and have an emergency meeting. I called my sister but she was not picking up. I tried her for the third time and she didn't pick up.\n\nSo I took my niece to work with me. She sat in my office, most of my co-workers were kind enough to offer to entertain her from time to time as I was at the meeting. However, they told me she was really bored out of her mind and pretty tired. She was there for about two hours already.\n\nSo I called my girlfriend (25F) and asked her to please come pick up my niece and take her to my place. We have been dating for about 2 years and my sister knows her (admittedly not particularly well). She came over and picked my niece up. I headed home once I was done with the meeting and they'd had quite a bit of fun together. Unlike me, my girlfriend is quite gracious with kids and she handled everything perfectly.\n\nThe next day I told my sister the whole situation because well, I thought I have to since her daughter was under my care when all this happened.\n\nShe told me I was unbelievable and that I needed to understand that work comes after family and that I should not have left my niece with my girlfriend anyways. I told her she needed to get over herself. She is currently not talking to me. She has even involved my brother, who agrees with her and thinks I owe her an apology.\n\nAm I the AH in this situation?", "created_utc": 1674725016, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10lny6w/aita_for_leaving_my_niece_with_my_gf/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

After three calls, the very least she should have done was return the call. Even if there wasn't a message left. I was going to say it was on you but your sister nagged you about an \"emergency\" and then failed to answer the phone when you called. This left you no choice.", "NTA you didnt dump her on a stranger or girlfriend of 1 month, but with your partner of two years. Also you called her and she refused to answer your call - she is the negligent mother. She also ignored you when you said it was not convenient.\n\nWhat was your sisters emergency - and how can a mother not pick up the phone to the caregiver of her child - what if her daughter had an accident or had a medical emergency and you needed to speak her? She's negligent.\n\nYou have to learn to say no means no.", "NTA\n\nYour sister practically dumped her kid on you, knowing it wasn't a good time and then vanish off the earths crust so you couldn't contact her to know you needed to leave. \n\nShe relied on you for an emergency and when told it wasn't the right time for you either, she insisted anyway. \n\nIf she wanted you to look after her kid in general, she should've been more on time with it and should've told you specifically... Even then you took care of the kid the best you could, but you also have a life.. You're not a free baby sitter", "Unless there\u2019s some missing info that your GF has some sort of reason why she cannot take care of children, I\u2019d go for a solid NTA. \n\nIt was an emergency and you took care of your niece. Another emergency ensued and you entrusted said niece to your partner whom you know well and trust. \n\nYour sister entrusted her daughter to you, therefore you are entitled to care for her in loco parentis, as it were. As your sister did not answer her phone, you were in the right to make decisions for your niece\u2019s well-being, i.e. need to sleep.", "I think NTA. Maybe she should have answered the damn phone when you called. 3 times! What if your niece had been hurt?", "NTA. You tried to call her. It's not as though you left your niece with some random.\n\nYou may need to create boundaries at work though. Seems wild to be called in simply for a meeting. What if they couldn't reach you?", "NTA.\n\nYour sister pushed her daughter into your care and you were not able to contact her. A parent has to be available for emergencies, so this was a huge mistake on her part.\n\nIt was her own fault that you even had to bring a child to your workplace. If such emergencies happen frequently you might be the AH for even accepting babysitting your niece in the first place, but you did resist and she kept insisting that you take her. So still your sisters fault.", "NTA- you niece was safe the entire time and sounds like she had a good time with your girlfriend. Our jobs are important to us so we have to make things work. Your sister was insistent you take her she should have been happy for any kind of last minute child care.", "NTA. What parent doesnt pick up the phone when the person watching their kid is calling.", "NTA You made sure your niece was cared for at all times.", "INFO: What were your respective emergencies? What was your sister's emergency? What was your work emergency?\n\nDefinitely leaning N T A here but if your sister was, like, deathly ill in the hospital, I think it might be reasonable to ask you to skip out on your meeting. If this was some lesser \"emergency\", then I completely understand your point of view.", "NTA I think, if you had barely been dating and it had only been for a couple of months, id have said you shouldnt have done that.\n\nBut as its been 2 years, I really think its ok.\nYou also did try your best, you did look after her, until she got extremely bored.", "NTA, I thought it was going to be the girlfriend who complained to be honest. It's not like you left her with a complete stranger and if your sister is going to dump her daughter on you then she should expect that your girlfriend would be involved anyway.", "NTA.  It\u2019d be different if you had only been dating her a week or something like that. Just as your sister had an emergency, so did you. Sometimes work calls and our jobs are important. Been there on many occasions.", "NTA. Her being this upset would be justifiable *if* you hadn\u2019t attempted to contact her or if she didn\u2019t know your girlfriend or if she told you she wasn\u2019t comfortable with your girlfriend watching her daughter in the past. Imo it\u2019s super weird that she didn\u2019t call you back, as Im assuming your next point of contact with her was the next day. What if there was an actual life or death emergency?? If anything she owes you an apology for not picking up your calls and not calling you back as soon as she was able. \n\nYou did your job correctly, if she\u2019s pissed it\u2019s probably for some deeper reason that likely doesn\u2019t have anything to do with you.", "NTA - You acted like a responsible and gracious adult. However your sister is definitely an AH for dumping her kid on you to fawn over a grown ass man with the flu.", "NTA especially as your sister was going to see her boyfriend who had the flu. \n\nShe could have infected her daughter, you and your girlfriend.", "NTA \n\nYour sisters need for a babysitter was not an emergency. She didn't have to see her bf. \n\nYou had to go into work and the child was safe with you. You've been with your gf for a long time and you trust her with your niece. I don't see anything wrong with what you did. \n\nYour sister is a hypocrite.", "NTA Her daughter is her responsibility and whatever she had going on comes after her family.  Next time she should plan better to take care of her daughter.\n\nYou and your girlfriend did the best you could to take care of her.

Your sister asked last minute, you said not great timing, but agreed.  You ALSO had a last minute emergency, tried calling sister who DIDNT PICK UP THREE TIMES.  What else could you do? You left her with someone you know well, obviously, and your sister knows somewhat.   What was your sisters emergency out of curiosity?

So let me get this straight, the person she'd entrusted her child to tries to reach her several times and she not only doesn't pick up, she doesn't call or text back to find out what's going in? Later that evening? At all? God forbid there had been a medical issue.", "NTA\n\n Why is she dumping her kid on you when you told her you can't have her? And no, her kid doesn't come before your job and financial stability. If she is so worried about her kid, she should answer the phone when the person who has her daughter calls her.

Way to spread that flu virus), and then yelling at you that family comes before work. Kids come before boyfriends ma\u2019am. You are very nice to rearrange your life, and get multiple others involved (your coworkers and your gf) to take care of your niece even though, you are not as gracious with kids. Your sister should\u2019ve picked up her phone and not let you hanging even when you explained to her up front in wasn\u2019t a convenient time for you.", "Do you want to know what sisters emergency was?

The flu sucks, but a capable adult can take care of themselves with it.

You shouldnt not have accepted looking after your niece. Thats not an emergency. Learn to be firm.\n\nNow how does she explain her negligence in not answering the phone when you called?
