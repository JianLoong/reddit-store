I got a call from work saying that there was a problem and that I needed to go back and have an emergency meeting. I called my sister but she was not picking up. I tried her for the third time and she didn't pick up.\n\nSo I took my niece to work with me. She sat in my office, most of my co-workers were kind enough to offer to entertain her from time to time as I was at the meeting. However, they told me she was really bored out of her mind and pretty tired. She was there for about two hours already.\n\nSo I called my girlfriend (25F) and asked her to please come pick up my niece and take her to my place. We have been dating for about 2 years and my sister knows her (admittedly not particularly well). She came over and picked my niece up. I headed home once I was done with the meeting and they'd had quite a bit of fun together. Unlike me, my girlfriend is quite gracious with kids and she handled everything perfectly.\n\nThe next day I told my sister the whole situation because well, I thought I have to since her daughter was under my care when all this happened.\n\nShe told me I was unbelievable and that I needed to understand that work comes after family and that I should not have left my niece with my girlfriend anyways. I told her she needed to get over herself. She is currently not talking to me.

Especially when it was the healthy, kind, joyful choice form the kid...\nWhat was mom actually mad about here?... Nothing bad happened, at all..nothing even questionable happened. \n\n\"My girlfriend of two years is available, she's great with kids\" would be a stellar recommendation for a babysitter.", "NTA. Child over boyfriend. Sister is in the wrong here.", "NTA. The facts are you left your niece with someone you know better than your sister would know a babysitter she would pay for. I see nothing wrong with this your sister got free childcare at the last minute. Beggars can\u2019t be choosers.", "NTA. And tell her she should put her child first over her bf", "NTA - You did your best.  You had a work emergency.  You and your colleagues tried entertaining her, she was unsurprisingly bored in an office setting after several hours.  You left your niece with you GF of 2 years, not 2 weeks.  And your sister didn't answer her phone when you tried to reach her!  What if the kid was injured and she was needed emergently?\n\nApologize for agreeing to help your sister during her 'emergency' and assure her you will never make that mistake again and hand her your brother's phone # since he's ready, willing and able to stick his nose into the situation.", "NTA. You had someone trustworthy take care of the kid, not some random person you found on the street that day. The child was well taken care of. She's being ridiculous. And her emergency was that her boyfriend had the flu? Unless he's being admitted to the hospital for that flu, that's bull. Maybe she should recognize that her kid's supposed to come first.", "NTA, your sister dumped her kid on you without any concern for how it affected you and it's not like you left her home alone all night. I'm assuming your girlfriend is a fully capable adult, your sister does indeed need to get over herself", "NTA\n\nYou made sure your niece was taken care of by your girlfriend.  And your niece was bored and tired at your work.  \n\nYour sister is being a total AH here.  Work is what pays the bills so your family doesn't starve and has a roof over their heads.  \n\nIt reads like she insisted \"You should have left work to be with my baby!\"  Which is absolutely absurd.  Particularly when she ditched her kid for her boyfriend's \"man flu.\"", " NTA. I didn\u2019t finish reading and I don\u2019t have to! Your sister says Family comes firsts. Then she should have taken care of her daughter and she should\nHave picked up, when you needed her. She didn\u2019t do either. She owes you a big sorry and obviously something for babbysiting. How\nMany hours did you sit? X 8 bucks? - you and you GF deserve bottle of wine if she I cheap or couple massage if she a is a normal person. Have a nice day", "NTA. But your sister definitely is.", "Definitely NTA but the sister is 100% the AH.", "NTA She should pick up her phone. He called her 3 times and she was unreachable. OP don\u2019t do your sister any more favours because she doesn\u2019t appreciate it", "Someone should tell her work comes before boyfriends and daughters come before boyfriends.\nNTA op. Your sister is a piece of work", "Yup. My husband's job, if you call in sick too often, the next time you call in sick there is a VERY good chance someone will show up at your front door checking to see if you're actually sick. My husband went 7 years straight without taking a single day of sick leave. This year he had to take 10 days because he got Covid and then another 10 days when he got the flu. He just got his annual evaluation and was HEAVILY dinged and commented on for the amount of sick leave he took.", "I'm sad to hear that. Ten days for COVID aren't much at all", "And then for OPs brother to side with the sister?  Why wasn't he watching the child?", "If they still did free awards I would absolutely give you one! Instead please accept my cackling laughter \ud83d\ude05", "Unfortunaltey if said man has been babied since he is an adolescent there is no cure.", "My husband is a first responder (city pop. 6,000). They have 1 IT guy, who is completely USELESS; Wasn't concerned when a roof leak was dripping on the servers. Doesn't set new passwords. In fact the security is SO bad that they've been permanently locked out of multiple state and federal databases. That's just a few examples. And the dude gets paid 6 figures for this ineptitude.\n\nLast night the teletype and 911 went down. They couldn't get ahold of the IT guy. So the city just didn't have 911 for the night. Anyone in the city called 911 and it would have been automatically rolled over to a neighboring city. But that city doesn't respond to the calls. They just take the info and call the city my husband works in and passes it on for them to respond. It's ridiculous. NOBODY understands how the IT guy hasn't been fired a long time ago. At this point we figure he has got to have some dirt on somebody or something.", "100%", "Skipping an important work meeting can jeopardize someone\u2019s job so yeah, I\u2019d consider that an emergency.", "So why denigrate him for having the 'man flu' when all we know is that he had the flu?\n\nJust any opportunity to shit on men?", "\"having the man flu\" is a little different than just being sick, my dude.\nThat's the point.\nHe wasn't sick enough to need her to unload her kid and nurse him overnight.\nWhatever it was,  was \"man flu\" and not an overnight emergency.\n\nCrappy way to put it? Sure. Call that out, we can own that it is offensive. However.... It doesn't in any way mean men can't get sick.\n\nAnd it is true that, in general broad strokes terms, women are a lot more likely to have to keep going with illness, while their male partners crash entirely. \nWhen the whole family gets sick, it's typically mom that takes care of everyone. Including herself. \n\nYou can find recent reddit threads of married folks asking about just that double standard... Wife having to care for the kids while sick because husband didn't want to take days off, but she had to take days off to care for them when he was sick..."]}
