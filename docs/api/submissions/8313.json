She was there for about two hours already.\n\nSo I called my girlfriend (25F) and asked her to please come pick up my niece and take her to my place. We have been dating for about 2 years and my sister knows her (admittedly not particularly well). She came over and picked my niece up. I headed home once I was done with the meeting and they'd had quite a bit of fun together.

I told her she needed to get over herself. She is currently not talking to me.

Look in the mirror and say that.", "*Her* gf, which I hope isn't their problem.", "I work in chemistry, and if a reactor breaks, everybody is getting called into the plant to secure all the other equipment, fix the problem, initialize emergency containment, etc etc etc. \n\nThere's lots of jobs that every great once in a while, have enough shit hit the fan that you get called din whether you want to or not", "Who goes visit someone with the flu????
