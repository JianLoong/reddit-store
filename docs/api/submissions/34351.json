Just this morning the bank let me know the vehicle had been paid in full (so the buyer could receive the title) I then receive a call to my cell from an unknown number while I\u2019m at lunch. Planning to call back when I freed up from break and catching up, I walk back into the office to find they had also called my shared work phone number (which I did not disclose to them) I immediately went back outside and returned the call from my cell phone. We are talking and he says they found a bottle of stop leak in my trunk and are saying my radiator is messed up. For context, the vehicle I sold had less than 50k miles on it and had never had a mechanical problem. The stop leak was for my wife\u2019s vehicle and I had left it in there when we moved 5 months ago and forgotten it. Now they are claiming that since it wasn\u2019t disclosed to them that I am going to have to front the cost of repairs for the radiator and whatever else they find wrong on this car. I began to become irate but kept my cool for the most part looking through the bill of sale and contract I signed nothing states I must disclose any and all mechanical issues or be the person to fork up the cash for them to turn for a profit. He said he would call me back as he was the auction\u2019s middle man and had to talk to the dealer about what I had told him.

He called me an asshole for not disclosing the issue and possible others they were going to find. I am not sure what I should\u2019ve done as I\u2019m not a mechanic and the vehicle was driving fine with no lights or anything.

I\u2019m smelling a scam here - it sounds to me like someone was at least partially fishing for information.
