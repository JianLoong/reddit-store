November last year, her fianc\u00e9 lands himself in the ER because he slipped on some stairs. Ended up with a broken arm and he needed surgery. He didn\u2019t have any insurance at the time, so they had to use more than half of their wedding budget to settle the hospital bill.\n\nMy sister calls me and asks me if I could loan her 6000 dollars, because they needed to start booking things for the wedding. She said she could get the money eventually if she saved every month but they needed it at that very moment, so she has no choice. I said yes, because money isn\u2019t tight as I live alone and I knew she needed it. \n\nThe issues occur when my SIL (32) finds out about our arrangement. My brother (33) knew about the whole thing but he never told his wife. My sister\u2019s fianc\u00e9 let it slip when he was with SIL and my brother.\n\nThe next day, she calls me up to say that it\u2019s nice I\u2019m helping them out. I told her that she\u2019s my sister and I\u2019m doing alright financially, so it wasn\u2019t a big deal. Her immediate response was: \u201cI just can\u2019t help but wonder why we weren\u2019t given a helping hand too. It\u2019s been tough with the kids. It\u2019s just so funny to me. He is your sibling too after all. I guess in this family, we play favourites. I just thank God I wasn\u2019t raised like this.\u201d\n\nUp till this point, I wasn\u2019t even aware they needed help financially. My brother never spoke to me about any financial hardships he was going through. SIL reveals that she lost her job a while back and my brother has been the sole breadwinner since. She used to bring home a bigger pay check, so the sudden shift was hard for them. I didn\u2019t know about any of this. SIL asks if I\u2019ll help them out and I tell her I\u2019ll get back to her.\n\nI call my brother after to inform him what happened and ask if he needs help. He\u2019s furious because he repeatedly told her to her to keep their situation to herself. He says he doesn\u2019t need the help and that he\u2019s sorry for the way SIL behaved.\n\nSIL apparently got chewed out and called my sister to complain and then guilt tripped her, saying she\u2019s so lucky she got help when she asked, because when my SIL asked, she didn\u2019t get anything. She also informed my sister that she will not be attending the wedding as it will be a sour occasion for her when she sees me there. Brother and SIL are now on very rocky terms, barely speaking to each other and SIL insists that it is my fault entirely for roping my brother into this.\n\nI feel somewhat guilty here because I\u2019m the oldest sibling and I should have asked if my brother was okay. My lack of attention screwed me because I couldn\u2019t help him when he needed it and he had to deal with this all on his own. \n\nI could be an asshole here because I feel like if I had just dealt with my SIL on my own without bringing my brother into it, none of these problems would have occurred.", "created_utc": 1683787704, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13efdni/aita_for_lending_my_sister_money_for_her_wedding/", "score": 765, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s an ugly, inappropriate, manipulative way to fight.  Otoh, it sounds like your brother may be stonewalling and not admitting that they can\u2019t manage an overwhelming problem, so it sounds like he\u2019s made her feel helpless and trapped, which is triggering her bad behavior.  Your SIL and your brother need couples therapy, because until a) they start working together and b) she stops drawing other people into the conflict, things will not get better between them.  They need to have a SHARED strategy for dealing with their strained finances.\n\nTalking to your brother was a normal, natural, caring thing to do.

I think if you had given her money and your brother found out about it his feelings would have really been hurt not to mention his pride. Her contacting you after your brother specifically told her not to tell you is what made him mad. She was being a jealous sneak by calling you. The fact that she attacked you almost immediately shows that.   You're only a year older than your brother and you're not a mind reader hun.  I'm the oldest of 4 and have always felt responsible for my siblings so I get the guilty feelings your having but trust me, it's not your fault.   Speak with your brother one and one and assure him that you just asked out of love and if he ever does need anything all he needs to do is call.  As for your SIL she can just get over it.  I'd leave that to your brother to deal with though.  Last thing you want to do is get in the middle of that.", "NTA, this isn't your fault, it's your SIL playing woe is me.

Go to your sister\u2019s wedding and have a wonderful time", "NTA - and wow is your SIL an entitled you-know-what.", "NTA if your brother needed help he would have asked you. you would have helped he didnt' ask so you did NOTHING WRONG. now your SIL is an ahole cuz although she lost her job whats stopping her from getting another job to help out the household instead of asking for handouts. that could be why your brother and SIL are arguing so much now dont let and entitled person make you feel bad or guilty when you're own family is telling you everything is fine", "NTA\n\nYou are not responsible for information you were never given. It sounds like you have done everything in good faith. What is going down in your brother\u2019s family is VERY much about them and their problems.", "NTA in any way. So, SIL comes from the \"where's mine\" set. Someone got something for some reason. Where's mine? Not a good look", "NTA  \n\n\nThere's an old expression:  \"No good deed goes unpunished.\"  You are doing your sister a solid, and had no idea your brother needed help.  Not that it matters because he sounds like he doesn't need help (or doesn't believe they need help) and wants to sort out his own business.  It also isn't your fault your SIL is acting so entitled.  This is a \"her\" problem.  And most likely, while you loaning your sister money may have escalated things faster than anticipated, this didn't come from nowhere.  These issues already existed, and sooner or later, this issue was gonna come to a head between your brother and SIL.  Don't feel bad about yourself, you did a good thing.", "NTA! Your selfish SIL is the AH and I hope your bro cuts her loose", "First off, you are giving your sister a loan, not a gift.  It might end up becoming a gift in the future...  these things sometimes do, but at the moment, it's a loan.  Nothing your SIL said implied she was looking for a temporary loan.  She was looking for a handout, because apparently someone else got one.\n\nAlso, your SIL and brother might be in a less than ideal financial circumstance at the moment, but there are degrees.  My guess there are marital problems there that greatly exceed just the loss of her job.  Attempting to guilt trip you into giving her some cash was probably a last-minute hail-mary attempt to squirrel some funds away for herself before she decides to bail on the whole shebang.  And no, you won't be getting THAT money back.", "NTA- You didn't know about their problems and SIL never asked for help. She went behind your brother's back and crossed a firm boundary that was set by him, SIL totally created this situation. You didn't do anything wrong and ofc, you're going to ask your brother what's going on with him, nothing wrong with that. It sucks that SIL is being this way but it's not your fault.", "SIL is toxic AF. Keep the cash to lend to your brother for when he's ready to divorce her ass. NTA", "You are not giving free money away.  Your sister is paying you back.  It's not the same as what your SIL is implying.  She wants a free handout that she probably can not pay back.  Your brother does not want it.  \n\nNTA - the relationship is probably strained before you.", "NTA\n\nI cant see how you'd ever think you were.\n\nYou helped people who asked for it.\n\nThis other party never asked for your help, so how would you have thought to help them?\n\nYou didn't offer charity or a gift, you've given a loan.", "NTA - Your sister called and asked. I'm sure if your brother had called and asked for help you would have done so as well. How were you to know bro/sil were having issues unless they told you. SIL is the AH", "wow sSIL is so entitled. your brother didnt want people to know maybe because they are not in need, just maybe they dont have money to luxury but can manage.but aparently SIL thinks since you have the money you should distribute to the family.  \n\nso my question is: when is the divorce? because going behind husband back and undermining his sisters was not a good choice", "Yeah, SIL brings up how OP was raised but like, the only person we need to question how they were raised is SIL. Kinda wonder if SIL lost her job for HR issues\u2026\n\nBrother never asked for help. And even then, on going struggles are a lot different to help out with than a one time emergency.", "Exactly. NTA.", "Yes, brother and SIL need to be on the same page about finances. That\u2019s the real root of the problem here.\n\nSIL\u2019s conduct is still pretty shocking to me, though. \n\n\u201cI just can\u2019t help but wonder why we weren\u2019t given a helping hand too. It\u2019s been tough with the kids. It\u2019s just so funny to me. He is your sibling too after all. I guess in this family, we play favourites. I just thank God I wasn\u2019t raised like this.\u201d\n\nWho says that?!", ">so it sounds like he\u2019s made her feel helpless and trapped, which is triggering her bad behavior.\n\nHere's where I don't agree with your comment.  No one is stopping SIL from getting another job even a temporary one.  OP's brother probably brought it up to wife time after time with no results.  Maybe it's SIL's pride that won't take even a temporary lower pay job than what she is used to earning.  But if your family is in dire straits and a second income is needed, then you do what you have to do to contribute towards the family's household expenses.  But you don't ask for a handout if you're not actively trying your best; asking for help is acceptable if she couldn't work due to health reasons.", ">You have another sibling who kept their hardship hidden, did not want help, and then their SO is mad at you for not giving a gift. \n\nOr maybe it's not such a hardship as SIL is making it out to be.  They just may not be able to go on vacations or buy luxury things as they used to.  Nothing is stopping SIL from getting another job after losing her job \"A While Back\", even a temporary lower paying job to contribute toward their family's household expenses.", "It was OP's sister fiance that accidently let it slip out.", ">Plus here is the thing everyone is hiring. She could have already been working. It may be not what she use to do. It may not even be for as much money. But she could have a job and that\u2019s better than nothing.\n\nI wish I had scrolled down to see this comment.  I posted something similar to those who said OP's brother was an AH or he was showing \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9.  I think it's SIL pride that won't let her take even a temporary, lower paying job in order to contribute towards the household finances.", "Exactly what rough patch?  Is only SIL saying so?  I have questions about this because if SIL had lost her job \"a while back\", why didn't she try to find another job?  Even taking a temporary job that's not in her usual job description is better than nothing and would have put a second income into the household.  Maybe it's not OP's brother pride that stopped him from saying anything, maybe he told his wife the same thing about her getting a job.  \"A While Back\" is the issue and not OP nor her Brother.  There is no way, as a wife, if our household was struggling financially would I just sit on my ass and not be willing to work a job even if the pay was half of what I used to earn.", "OP is a female.  But everything else you wrote is correct!", "It was OP's sister fiance that accidently let it slip out.", "Losing your job is a rough patch for most people. I agree completely with you. There are a lot of questions about this story so that why I said it was an info issue.", "My bad \ud83d\ude13", "Ok then, the groom is a bit of an AH.", ">It is a huge red flag that OP's brother is most upset about SIL telling the truth about their finances rather than be open to the idea that family could help them out in a rough patch.\n\nOr maybe the \ud83d\udea9 is SIL not getting another job after losing her job \"a while back\".  Maybe OP's brother brought this up to his wife and she (\ud83d\udea9) ignored it.  There is no way that, as a wife, I would willing let our financial situation get so dire that I wouldn't be willing to take a temporary job that may pay half of what I used to earn.  Maybe that's the problem, that her pride (\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9) won't let her accept any job that pays less than what she was used to.", ">Why SIL not find another job then. She lost her job \"a while back\" so don't wait around a while to find a new one, unless it is physically impossible to do so.\n\n\ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udffd is the comment I was waiting for!!!  If things are as tight/desperate as SIL is making it out to be, then why isn't she looking for job.  Even a temporary job outside of her normal job description or a lesser paying job is still money going towards the household.  I also wonder how long \"a while back\" was/is?", "Yup, all that could be true, that\u2019s why I said it\u2019s an info issue bc we don\u2019t have enough information to make judgment.", "What we do know is that her husband was against what she did. May have been bc of pride, or some other reason - the thing is, she went behind his back, and that is clearly stated.\n\nFWIW, my ex had a job where he earned more than me until he lost it. After a few months of not finding anything that didn't require intense physical labor, he started toying with the idea of being a SAHD, to the point of letting his unemployment benefits expire.\n\nEdit: a word", "SIL earned more than brother before she was laid off. True. Does it mean that she worked harder? Not necessarily. She could have been in a middle-management position, spending over half of her day in meetings. \nIt is more likely that it isn't that she doesn't want to work, but that she doesn't want to do *that* work.", "Right, that's why I said this is an info issue. It sounds like your family was able to economically survive your Ex's decision not to work but we are less clear on the dynamics of SIL's situation. \n\nIf I needed charity just to feed my children but my IL's were giving out $6k for a wedding to another family member, I'd question exactly how much of a \"family\" I was apart of.", "No is arguing that more pay = harder work. I have a white collar job and I certainly don't work *harder* than someone working full time at McDonalds. \n\nMy point is more with families that have children, usually the higher income earner prioritizes keeping their job/income because of the impact on their budget. Most families cannot survive on one income, especially when we the brother's income is less than SIL's income. \n\nAgain, I see this as an info issue because if SIL can barely feed the family, that makes the situation look a lot worse for OP but if SIL's complaints are like we canceled our yearly Disney vacation, then obviously SIL would be completely wrong."]}
