November last year, her fianc\u00e9 lands himself in the ER because he slipped on some stairs. Ended up with a broken arm and he needed surgery. He didn\u2019t have any insurance at the time, so they had to use more than half of their wedding budget to settle the hospital bill.\n\nMy sister calls me and asks me if I could loan her 6000 dollars, because they needed to start booking things for the wedding. She said she could get the money eventually if she saved every month but they needed it at that very moment, so she has no choice. I said yes, because money isn\u2019t tight as I live alone and I knew she needed it. \n\nThe issues occur when my SIL (32) finds out about our arrangement. My brother (33) knew about the whole thing but he never told his wife. My sister\u2019s fianc\u00e9 let it slip when he was with SIL and my brother.\n\nThe next day, she calls me up to say that it\u2019s nice I\u2019m helping them out. I told her that she\u2019s my sister and I\u2019m doing alright financially, so it wasn\u2019t a big deal. Her immediate response was: \u201cI just can\u2019t help but wonder why we weren\u2019t given a helping hand too. It\u2019s been tough with the kids. It\u2019s just so funny to me. He is your sibling too after all. I guess in this family, we play favourites. I just thank God I wasn\u2019t raised like this.\u201d\n\nUp till this point, I wasn\u2019t even aware they needed help financially. My brother never spoke to me about any financial hardships he was going through. SIL reveals that she lost her job a while back and my brother has been the sole breadwinner since. She used to bring home a bigger pay check, so the sudden shift was hard for them. I didn\u2019t know about any of this. SIL asks if I\u2019ll help them out and I tell her I\u2019ll get back to her.\n\nI call my brother after to inform him what happened and ask if he needs help. He\u2019s furious because he repeatedly told her to her to keep their situation to herself. He says he doesn\u2019t need the help and that he\u2019s sorry for the way SIL behaved.\n\nSIL apparently got chewed out and called my sister to complain and then guilt tripped her, saying she\u2019s so lucky she got help when she asked, because when my SIL asked, she didn\u2019t get anything. She also informed my sister that she will not be attending the wedding as it will be a sour occasion for her when she sees me there. Brother and SIL are now on very rocky terms, barely speaking to each other and SIL insists that it is my fault entirely for roping my brother into this.\n\nI feel somewhat guilty here because I\u2019m the oldest sibling and I should have asked if my brother was okay. My lack of attention screwed me because I couldn\u2019t help him when he needed it and he had to deal with this all on his own. \n\nI could be an asshole here because I feel like if I had just dealt with my SIL on my own without bringing my brother into it, none of these problems would have occurred.", "created_utc": 1683787704, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13efdni/aita_for_lending_my_sister_money_for_her_wedding/", "score": 29, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She guiltripped you, and went directly behind your brothers back to do so. Then guiltripped your sister, escalating the situation further. \n\nAny issues between them is *not your fault*. Your SIL made some very poor personal choices, and you shouldn\u2019t be held accountable for them.", "1. I feel like you LEND your sister money for her wedding and your SIL is asking for a GIFT. This level of entitlement usually comes with someone not paying back, because according to them \" you can afford it\". Maybe this is not true and I know worse people compared to your SIL.\n\n2. If the \" borrowed \" money was for the household, wouldn't your brother find out about it at some point? How does her logic work here? And your brother does not want or need the help so...\n\n3. I would not DARE to call up my inlaws to GUILT them into giving me money. How was SHE raised that she doesn't have that sense of boundary?\n\nBut, all of the above becomes irrelevant because it's YOUR money and you can do with it whatever you want. Not guess who would need it and then lend/ gift them some.\n\nNtA. She did this to herself.", "NTA \nDon't feel guilty. Your sister (probably) asked out of desperation and sounds like she wants to pay you back.   \nYour SIL on the other hand, heard you gave her money and is now looking for a handout. Probably with no intention of paying you back.   \n \nYour brother doesn't want your help, you're not responsible for their financial situation and he doesn't want to be in debt to you.", "NTA. Your SIL is just bitter, she didn\u2019t get the reaction she wanted from you and then obvs not happy with her husbands reaction to you.  Sad when all you were trying to do was help your sister out.", "NTA\u2026. Your SIL is, though.  The level of entitlement she has to expect money from you and become angry is next level.  You do not owe anyone anything and the fact that you are willing and able to offer your siblings support is amazing.", "NTA.. in Austria we have a say \"sprechenden kindern kann geholfen werden\" (you can help talking kids... which means: f... ASK if you NEED anything otherwise no one knows) and of course they have to be on the same page about it...", "NTA.  No, this one is not your fault.  Your brother and his wife are not on the same page.  They\u2019re not working as a team, and that\u2019s creating conflict, which your SIL is triangulating to include you and now also your sister.  It\u2019s an ugly, inappropriate, manipulative way to fight.  Otoh, it sounds like your brother may be stonewalling and not admitting that they can\u2019t manage an overwhelming problem, so it sounds like he\u2019s made her feel helpless and trapped, which is triggering her bad behavior.  Your SIL and your brother need couples therapy, because until a) they start working together and b) she stops drawing other people into the conflict, things will not get better between them.  They need to have a SHARED strategy for dealing with their strained finances.\n\nTalking to your brother was a normal, natural, caring thing to do.  You wanted him to know you had his back and he can rely on you, but also make sure he actually wanted your help, which is what a good family would do.", "Nta your sil guilttripped didnt even bother to just idk ask nicely about helping.", "NTA\n\nYou're a good person to lend the money to your sister, however, make sure she pays it back because it might cause trouble if it takes too long.\n\nSIL sounds entitled of really in money trouble but your brother is too stubborn to admit he needs help....a man's pride can be a dangerous thing", "NTA but your SIL sure is.  There was no way to deal with your SIL on your ow without bringing your brother into it.  I think if you had given her money and your brother found out about it his feelings would have really been hurt not to mention his pride. Her contacting you after your brother specifically told her not to tell you is what made him mad. She was being a jealous sneak by calling you. The fact that she attacked you almost immediately shows that.   You're only a year older than your brother and you're not a mind reader hun.  I'm the oldest of 4 and have always felt responsible for my siblings so I get the guilty feelings your having but trust me, it's not your fault.   Speak with your brother one and one and assure him that you just asked out of love and if he ever does need anything all he needs to do is call.  As for your SIL she can just get over it.  I'd leave that to your brother to deal with though.  Last thing you want to do is get in the middle of that.", "NTA, this isn't your fault, it's your SIL playing woe is me.  She is the one that caused the drama by being pathetic.", "You could have just ignored what she said.  That said, she is a major AH and this situation just exposed a bad marriage.  NTA.", "NTA\n\nYour SIL is a manipulative scary person.\n\nYou cannot be at fault for not helping when you don\u2019t know they need help. And your sister reached out to ask for a loan. Is what SIL proposing a loan or just to \u201chelp\u201d?", "Why can't  family  members  keep  their business to themselves, stop telling  the family  your business. If someone  help you that should  stay between  you an the person", "Nta.\n\nYou were never asked to help, so you have nothing to feel guilty for. \n\nGood riddance on her for not attending the wedding. It's not her wedding, so she can calm the drama down.  Offer to carpool with your brother so he can relax for the night.", "Your sil is a wanna be leech and if you give her one cent, she will try to suck you dry. It will never end. NTA", "NTA\nAs you stated, you said you weren\u2019t aware of your brother and SIL\u2019s situation. While being in a tough spot is extremely stressful, and emotionally painful, it doesn\u2019t give anyone the right to take it out on others.\n\nI know a lot of people will disagree with this next part, but it might help the situation.\n\nYou could possibly send some money to your brother, just so he\u2019s able to pay for things like food, bills etc, however that\u2019s totally up to you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
