November last year, her fianc\u00e9 lands himself in the ER because he slipped on some stairs. Ended up with a broken arm and he needed surgery. He didn\u2019t have any insurance at the time, so they had to use more than half of their wedding budget to settle the hospital bill.\n\nMy sister calls me and asks me if I could loan her 6000 dollars, because they needed to start booking things for the wedding. She said she could get the money eventually if she saved every month but they needed it at that very moment, so she has no choice. I said yes, because money isn\u2019t tight as I live alone and I knew she needed it. \n\nThe issues occur when my SIL (32) finds out about our arrangement. My brother (33) knew about the whole thing but he never told his wife. My sister\u2019s fianc\u00e9 let it slip when he was with SIL and my brother.\n\nThe next day, she calls me up to say that it\u2019s nice I\u2019m helping them out. I told her that she\u2019s my sister and I\u2019m doing alright financially, so it wasn\u2019t a big deal. Her immediate response was: \u201cI just can\u2019t help but wonder why we weren\u2019t given a helping hand too. It\u2019s been tough with the kids. It\u2019s just so funny to me. He is your sibling too after all. I guess in this family, we play favourites. I just thank God I wasn\u2019t raised like this.\u201d\n\nUp till this point, I wasn\u2019t even aware they needed help financially. My brother never spoke to me about any financial hardships he was going through. SIL reveals that she lost her job a while back and my brother has been the sole breadwinner since. She used to bring home a bigger pay check, so the sudden shift was hard for them. I didn\u2019t know about any of this. SIL asks if I\u2019ll help them out and I tell her I\u2019ll get back to her.\n\nI call my brother after to inform him what happened and ask if he needs help. He\u2019s furious because he repeatedly told her to her to keep their situation to herself. He says he doesn\u2019t need the help and that he\u2019s sorry for the way SIL behaved.\n\nSIL apparently got chewed out and called my sister to complain and then guilt tripped her, saying she\u2019s so lucky she got help when she asked, because when my SIL asked, she didn\u2019t get anything. She also informed my sister that she will not be attending the wedding as it will be a sour occasion for her when she sees me there. Brother and SIL are now on very rocky terms, barely speaking to each other and SIL insists that it is my fault entirely for roping my brother into this.\n\nI feel somewhat guilty here because I\u2019m the oldest sibling and I should have asked if my brother was okay. My lack of attention screwed me because I couldn\u2019t help him when he needed it and he had to deal with this all on his own. \n\nI could be an asshole here because I feel like if I had just dealt with my SIL on my own without bringing my brother into it, none of these problems would have occurred.", "created_utc": 1683787704, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13efdni/aita_for_lending_my_sister_money_for_her_wedding/", "score": 460, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s an ugly, inappropriate, manipulative way to fight.  Otoh, it sounds like your brother may be stonewalling and not admitting that they can\u2019t manage an overwhelming problem, so it sounds like he\u2019s made her feel helpless and trapped, which is triggering her bad behavior.  Your SIL and your brother need couples therapy, because until a) they start working together and b) she stops drawing other people into the conflict, things will not get better between them.  They need to have a SHARED strategy for dealing with their strained finances.\n\nTalking to your brother was a normal, natural, caring thing to do.

I think if you had given her money and your brother found out about it his feelings would have really been hurt not to mention his pride. Her contacting you after your brother specifically told her not to tell you is what made him mad. She was being a jealous sneak by calling you. The fact that she attacked you almost immediately shows that.   You're only a year older than your brother and you're not a mind reader hun.  I'm the oldest of 4 and have always felt responsible for my siblings so I get the guilty feelings your having but trust me, it's not your fault.   Speak with your brother one and one and assure him that you just asked out of love and if he ever does need anything all he needs to do is call.  As for your SIL she can just get over it.  I'd leave that to your brother to deal with though.  Last thing you want to do is get in the middle of that.", "NTA, this isn't your fault, it's your SIL playing woe is me.

It\u2019s no wonder why the SIL lost her job if this is her level of manipulation and entitlement. Also, she can get another job even if it\u2019s not as high of pay as her previous one.

It means all parties involved in a situation are aware of the communications \\*about\\* the situation.  \n\n\nAND, he is your brother. Why wouldn't you rope him in to what's going on? Heaven forbid your SIL has a drug or gambling problem he didn't know about.  \n\n\nYou are NTA and she can get over herself.", "NTA. YOUR SIL IS MANIPULATIVE. Understand this. Your SIL is manipulative and she is trying to force you and your sister out of money **when your brother is not okay with that**. I understand they are struggling, but instead of asking like a normal person, she is emotionally manipulating you for something.\n\nThis is not your fault. Stop blaming yourself. This is on your brother who refuses to receive help, and on her for trying to get money without asking, and decided to shame you and your sister.", "NTA. Your SIL sounds like a piece of work. Your SIL being on rocky terms with tour brother is entirely her own doing. Speculating here but I wonder if her sparkling attitude has anything to do with why she lost her job.", "NTA... this is not your fault. SIL is causing problems where there shouldn't be any. Just because you responded generously to an emergency doesnt mean that you have the means or desire to ask everyone else if they need financial help.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re all very much adults, and it\u2019s not your job to try to pay attention to their needs & try to address them. Clearly they were not on the same page about wanting to ask for help, that is not your fault.

She didn't get something free from you so she went and caused problems with literally everyone she could find. Your brother, who asked her to not betray his trust, found out what she was doing and laid into her.\n\nAllll of this is on her. SHE is the problem, not you. your brother is entitled to keep private financial issues to himself, and his wife contacting you was a bait and incredibly inappropriate. She went around her own husbands wishes to try and get money from you.\n\nTrust me, if things were actually bad, he would have told you himself. Instead she thought she had an opportunity for free money and defied their marriage by causing problems with you. It's greed and selfishness, in a nutshell.", "Honestly, f your SIL. if my siblings were in trouble i would 100% bail them out. but only if they asked for help.

At 32.99% due every 2 weeks a minimum of $1000 which will go to interest. And maybe next year or two it will touch the principle of the loan. Also you'll need collateral maybe her engagement ring in your possession and other valuables in case she defaults. You'll also need her social security, and other personal info to contact the credit bureaus. In case to track her payments.", "NTA\n\nThe whole thing is crazy. \n\nSIL is taking her anger on you and not attending wedding because why? \n\nShe is blowing this out of proportion and  your brother seems to handle this well but Jesus SIL\u2019s entitlement and I feel sorry for your Brother if he deals with that on a daily basis. \nOne how would you know they have a problem and two she has not right to criticise your upbringing.", "NTA. SIL is just greedy and entitled. It is also not her place to ask for money. Your brother should ask directly. This also shows the danger of lending money to family. When someone needs money, give it secretly, swear them to secrecy and never speak about it again.", "The old adage is that in a marriage, each soupse handles their own family. So, the fact that SIL reached outside of her family (twice!) to beg for money, and then got ticked off for being called out when you got in contact with your brother is a *her* problem. Not a you problem.\n\nThat she escalated with your sister, then sent regrets to the wedding because she is moping things didn't go her way is telling.\n\nThere are words to describe the kind of person that does this, but they are unkind and banned.\n\nNTA", "NTA.

None of this chaos is on you.", "NTA. Any issues she\u2019s facing now are entirely her own doing. Wonder how SHE was raised. Regardless, rude was the outcome.", "NTA.\n\nNot to mention the only connection between OP and SIL is his brother. There is almost nothing to be discussed between them that he should not be aware of. She had no reason to think anything she said to OP would not make it back to him.", "The only A-H I see here in this story is the BIL who is too proud to ask his family for help. Especially because OP blames herself for not being more proactive about seeing if her brother needed help.\n\nNo doubt SIL sounds very entitled in the way she communicated with OP but if my household was barely making ends-meet, I would definitely feel upset that there is a $6,000 dollar loan available for wedding between family members.\n\n>\" He\u2019s furious because he repeatedly told her to her to keep their situation to herself. He says he doesn\u2019t need the help and that he\u2019s sorry for the way SIL behaved.\"\n\nThis all sounds like pride and toxic masculinity is motivating the brother to not ask for help. The fact that OP included zero specifics about their financial situation leads me to believe they request was for necessities. Not something like SIL wants to take a vacation. \n\nLet's say SIL has been using a food bank to feed her children for several months since she lost her job, you wouldn't be upset that your family ILs have a $6,000 loan available for a wedding while you can't even feed your family.
