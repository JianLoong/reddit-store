They're playing with their own lives.", "NTA. 16 years old is way too old to be this immature.", "NTA. \n\nYou told them to stop, they refused. They\u2019re old enough to know better. \n\nThey\u2019re lucky you didn\u2019t break the gun after taking it.", "NTA.\n\nThe bus driver should have kicked them off the bus.", "NTA - This was pretty immature of them and they left you with few options.  It isn't crazy not to want to get squirted with a water gun.", "NTA. \n\nGod teenagers can be such AHs.\n\nI don't blame you at all. That's so incredibly disrespectful.", "NTA. Those dumb teenage girls are being stupid and immature. Thankfully, they are only spraying water, not bullets. If you see those kids on the bus again, you should record this and report them. They could be charged with assault at some point.", "NTA.\n\nPretty reasonable to not want to be squirted with water. The girls were very disrespectful and it\u2019s only a matter of time before someone either calls the police or they spray the wrong person and things get violent.", "NTA. But I definitely would have destroyed the water gun.", "NTA - Those teens are definitely old enough to know right from wrong. Sounds like they were just being little punks", "NTA - but check for a third teenager filming before you react next time.  Dipshit teens love getting reactions for their TikToks.  Best to just call the police", "NTA.  Spraying water on someone against their will is assault.  You could have been the one calling the police.", "NTA. Keep the water gun and tell them they can get it back from the police.", "NTA. Teenagers scare the shit out of me and I avoid them at all costs in public LOL", "Spraying you with water is assault. I would have loved for them to call the police, and then seen the shocked expressions on their faces when they're told that the only people in danger of criminal charges here is them.\n\nNTA", "NTA Sounds like to me those girls were acting like three year olds and needed a good spanking. You should have kept the water gun and smashed it.", "NTA and next time you should call the police and state 'There are two girls who appear to be holding what appears to be a gun and are currently pointing it at others. I am not sure if its real or not.' Should put some misery back in their lives which they seems to want to share with others.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

NTA. In the wrong mood I would have broken their gun instantly. They're not little kids, and they should know better.", "Oh yea let's just see if we can get people shot over being childish with water, that will show them /s", "Do. Not. Do. This. It could end up very badly.", "Absolutely terrible idea, potentially deadly and likely illegal.", "Who is assuming to get shot. Usually a bit of anti social behavior gets dealt with a stern warning. Police do have common sense, they do not turn up and shoot people. Where do people get these ideas from?", "Do elaborate how its illegal? I shall get the pop corn.", "Because that\u2019s exactly how Tamir Rice was killed at age 12. Exactly.", "You are suggesting that OP should make a false complaint to the police. Not only a false complaint, but one that involves someone having a gun. Do you really not see the problem with this?", "Filing a false police report is illegal. Saying you don't know if a gun is real when you know fully well it's a water gun is false reporting. Do you seriously not understand that?", ">holding what appears to be a gun and are currently pointing it at others.\n\nRead the words carefully. Which part of it is false? There are many ways to tell the same story and as a concerned citizen one can always call in to report suspicious activities. Keen to hear which law is being broken here to call it illegal.", "First of all its not a police report but a call to the police helpline where concerned people call in. How do you know its a water gun from the distance? Did you give it to them? What if its a real gun made to look like a toy? Do not assume unless you are sure of it. Also what business do people have with pointing things at others in a public area? The law provides safety to all citizens and get on with their business without fear of life. Idiots out there think its fun to harass people in any way they seem fit. They are called bullies.", "\"I am not sure if it is real or not.\" THAT is the false part. And regardless of whether or not it's illegal, it's absolutely not worth possibly getting a teenager killed.", "You have the maturity level of the teenagers spraying water at random strangers and thinking it\u2019s funny. You know that this is a blatant lie, and making false complaints to the police is in fact illegal.", "Well, if it comes to court, what the prosecution will argue is that you made the statement knowing full well that it would be interpreted as someone armed with a real gun, and made the report in order to cause a full scale armed police response. \n\nWhat would yo say \"Well, it was technically the truth\"? Good luck with that.\n\nMore to the point, the police have limited resources. Wasting those resources for getting payback for some petty crime is pretty disreputable behaviour.", "How can someone be sure if its real or not, its just a perceived notion of an observe event. Unless the person calling in has tested and is willing to testify that it is what it claims to be, it is usually 'what it appears to be', same as an 'allegation' unless proved in a court of law. Nothing illegal about it.", "People keep stating it is illegal yet can't say which law is being broken. Seems like you like to support bullies and insulting anyone who questions your judgement. Might be worth checking the mirror once in a while.\n\nIts a complaint, an allegation not a police report. Do you even know the difference between any of these?", "The water coming out of the front when they sprayed OP with it and the fact that it\u2019s made out of plastic might give a hint that it\u2019s not a real gun.", "He knows it's not real because he saw and felt water come out of it. You're being purposefully obtuse and I'm done talking to you.", "Anything short of a punch in the mouth for your agressors shouldn\u2019t leave you feeling guilty. You are the victim of this story. Honestly if you would have knocked one of their teeth out I would still not blame you, so don\u2019t feel guilty.", "NTA \n\nI would have smashed the guns after taking them. They can call the police.", "I would have broken those cheap plastic guns right over my knees", "Thank you everyone for the comments, I feel much better, I'm not used to these kind of things so I was a bit overwhelmed.", "NTA you handled it a lot better than I probably would have. I have IED and sensory issues (one of which is wet clothing) so they really should learn that you can't just mess with random people and expect no repercussions.", "NTA\n\nWhat the girls don't realize (because teenagers are not exactly known for thinking things through) is that if they mess with the wrong person, it could end *very badly* for them.", "Best piece of advice my dad ever gave me was, \"Don't fuck with strangers.\" Never know who you're messing with.", "I\u2019m pretty sure that I would have grabbed it and snapped it in half.", "You must be white.", "Along with:  If everyone isn't laughing at the end, it's not a \"prank.\"  You're just an asshole.", "Unfortunate and a sad event. But just because one happened doesn't mean that people should just assume the worst. Heard of how Kim Jong-nam was assassinated. Those who did it thought it was a prank. There are two sides to everything. So best not to harass people in the public and respect others if you want respect in return.", "This has happened way more than once. Do you just NOT watch any news at all? Or do you just stick with right wing crazies? It is a definite risk that you're going to get shot by police if they think you have a gun. And they're trained to shoot to kill. \n\nBut yes, best not to harrass people at all.", "Oh man. Nah. \n\nBut congrats on winning the worst take of the day award.", "Whatever...", "Right back at you. Have a good day.", "How can you be sure its water? What if its some sort of acid or water contaminated with some sort of deadly virus? Unless you are 100% sure, you just dont make assumptions. Bad things have happened because people assumed. The half brother of North Korean dictator was killed by what the two women thought was a harmless prank.", "It\u2019s weird that you are using the same event to both justify and refute your position."]}
