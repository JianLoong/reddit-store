It isn't crazy not to want to get squirted with a water gun.", "NTA. \n\nGod teenagers can be such AHs.\n\nI don't blame you at all. That's so incredibly disrespectful.", "NTA. Those dumb teenage girls are being stupid and immature. Thankfully, they are only spraying water, not bullets. If you see those kids on the bus again, you should record this and report them. They could be charged with assault at some point.", "NTA.\n\nPretty reasonable to not want to be squirted with water. The girls were very disrespectful and it\u2019s only a matter of time before someone either calls the police or they spray the wrong person and things get violent.", "NTA. But I definitely would have destroyed the water gun.", "NTA - Those teens are definitely old enough to know right from wrong. Sounds like they were just being little punks", "NTA - but check for a third teenager filming before you react next time.  Dipshit teens love getting reactions for their TikToks.  Best to just call the police", "NTA.  Spraying water on someone against their will is assault.  You could have been the one calling the police.", "NTA.

They're not little kids, and they should know better.", "Oh yea let's just see if we can get people shot over being childish with water, that will show them /s", "Do. Not. Do. This. It could end up very badly.", "Absolutely terrible idea, potentially deadly and likely illegal.", "Who is assuming to get shot. Usually a bit of anti social behavior gets dealt with a stern warning. Police do have common sense, they do not turn up and shoot people. Where do people get these ideas from?", "Do elaborate how its illegal? I shall get the pop corn.", "Because that\u2019s exactly how Tamir Rice was killed at age 12. Exactly.", "You are suggesting that OP should make a false complaint to the police. Not only a false complaint, but one that involves someone having a gun. Do you really not see the problem with this?", "Filing a false police report is illegal. Saying you don't know if a gun is real when you know fully well it's a water gun is false reporting. Do you seriously not understand that?", ">holding what appears to be a gun and are currently pointing it at others.\n\nRead the words carefully. Which part of it is false? There are many ways to tell the same story and as a concerned citizen one can always call in to report suspicious activities. Keen to hear which law is being broken here to call it illegal.", "First of all its not a police report but a call to the police helpline where concerned people call in. How do you know its a water gun from the distance? Did you give it to them? What if its a real gun made to look like a toy? Do not assume unless you are sure of it. Also what business do people have with pointing things at others in a public area? The law provides safety to all citizens and get on with their business without fear of life. Idiots out there think its fun to harass people in any way they seem fit. They are called bullies.", "\"I am not sure if it is real or not.\" THAT is the false part. And regardless of whether or not it's illegal, it's absolutely not worth possibly getting a teenager killed.", "You have the maturity level of the teenagers spraying water at random strangers and thinking it\u2019s funny. You know that this is a blatant lie, and making false complaints to the police is in fact illegal.", "Well, if it comes to court, what the prosecution will argue is that you made the statement knowing full well that it would be interpreted as someone armed with a real gun, and made the report in order to cause a full scale armed police response. \n\nWhat would yo say \"Well, it was technically the truth\"? Good luck with that.\n\nMore to the point, the police have limited resources. Wasting those resources for getting payback for some petty crime is pretty disreputable behaviour.", "How can someone be sure if its real or not, its just a perceived notion of an observe event. Unless the person calling in has tested and is willing to testify that it is what it claims to be, it is usually 'what it appears to be', same as an 'allegation' unless proved in a court of law. Nothing illegal about it.", "People keep stating it is illegal yet can't say which law is being broken. Seems like you like to support bullies and insulting anyone who questions your judgement. Might be worth checking the mirror once in a while.\n\nIts a complaint, an allegation not a police report. Do you even know the difference between any of these?", "The water coming out of the front when they sprayed OP with it and the fact that it\u2019s made out of plastic might give a hint that it\u2019s not a real gun.", "He knows it's not real because he saw and felt water come out of it. You're being purposefully obtuse and I'm done talking to you.", "Anything short of a punch in the mouth for your agressors shouldn\u2019t leave you feeling guilty. You are the victim of this story.

They can call the police.", "I would have broken those cheap plastic guns right over my knees", "Thank you everyone for the comments, I feel much better, I'm not used to these kind of things so I was a bit overwhelmed.", "NTA you handled it a lot better than I probably would have. I have IED and sensory issues (one of which is wet clothing) so they really should learn that you can't just mess with random people and expect no repercussions.", "NTA\n\nWhat the girls don't realize (because teenagers are not exactly known for thinking things through) is that if they mess with the wrong person, it could end *very badly* for them.", "Best piece of advice my dad ever gave me was, \"Don't fuck with strangers.\" Never know who you're messing with.", "I\u2019m pretty sure that I would have grabbed it and snapped it in half.", "You must be white.", "Along with:  If everyone isn't laughing at the end, it's not a \"prank.\"  You're just an asshole.", "Unfortunate and a sad event. But just because one happened doesn't mean that people should just assume the worst. Heard of how Kim Jong-nam was assassinated. Those who did it thought it was a prank. There are two sides to everything. So best not to harass people in the public and respect others if you want respect in return.", "This has happened way more than once. Do you just NOT watch any news at all? Or do you just stick with right wing crazies? It is a definite risk that you're going to get shot by police if they think you have a gun. And they're trained to shoot to kill. \n\nBut yes, best not to harrass people at all.", "Oh man. Nah. \n\nBut congrats on winning the worst take of the day award.", "Whatever...", "Right back at you. Have a good day.", "How can you be sure its water? What if its some sort of acid or water contaminated with some sort of deadly virus? Unless you are 100% sure, you just dont make assumptions. Bad things have happened because people assumed.

You honestly going to say that it would be reasonable to think they're going around squirting people with acid or deadly virus water?", "NTA - technically, spraying you is assault and you could have them arrested for it.  The bus driver should ahve called the police and had them meet the girls when they got off.", "it is definitely considered assault.  Whether you're being being assaulted with feathers, water, or bricks, it's still assault.  You should have gone ahead and dared them to call the cops and filed charges.

NTA.", "NTA and you handled this better than I would have.", "NTA no one likes getting unexpectedly sprayed by water by random strangers. Idk if you live in the U.S., but in today's climate, they're lucky all you did was yell and take one of their water guns. They could've been seriously injured or even killed had you been one of those unhinged assholes we've seen in the media recently shooting people for pulling into their driveways, knocking on their doors, or buying skittles.", "NTA, they\u2019re teenager shits.", "I am so angry for you right now. Unprovoked attacks make me unreasonably angry (probably because I was a victim of a bad one).  \n\nThose girls will eventually get what is coming to them and it will be ugly.

Wouldn't touch a hair on someone's head but people who don't know me don't know that. In general though not being a dick to other people is a good way to live your life", "...I see.......", "Yepp, the only punishments are 25 to life or nothing! Fines and community service no longer exist. Do you know what the definition for assault is?", "Spraying someone with water, at least in the United States, would be classified under simple assault. It's a misdemeanor.", "Have you actually watched people getting shot? I have and it happens to those who fail to comply. Police just don't turn up and shoot people like what you see in the movies. Police shoot when they fear for their own health or public safety. So stop watching the framed news and start researching the facts.", "So a concerned citizen calling about something is suddenly a false police report. So if I see a white van parked outside my house in the middle of the night, I should just not find it suspicious in case my intuitions are false. Its just someone selling ice cream. There is no right or wrong, you tell them what you perceive, its upto them to investigate and decide.", "A concerned call to the police is different to giving an official statement. People can call the police hotline to report anything suspicious. Its not false, its your perception on what you see and there is no right or wrong.", "> Its not false, its your perception on what you see\n\nFor that to work, it would have be believable that you actually thought their squirt gun was filled with acid or water laced with a deadly virus.

WTF?", "Do NOT DO THIS! It WILL get someone KILLED! Especially if you live in the US. Kids have been shot and killed for playing with water guns after this happen.", "Okay so what you are saying is you know more than professional journalist because you never saw it happen with your eyes. I mean I never met anyone with cancer so by your logic since I never saw it with my own eyes then it's a made up disease.", "NTA - after the second spray there won't be a squirt gun", "NTA.\n\nI really hope you kept the water gun.", "NTA!", "Right? I probably would\u2019ve done the same.", "Nta those kids are just having fun though it\u2019s incredibly annoying for the receiver those kids were just being jerks", "No", "That's literally assault. They assaulted you.", "NTA I probably would have started to spray them and laugh after taking the gun. That, or break it.", "Police shot Tamir Rice within 2 seconds of arriving on scene; the patrol car didn\u2019t even come to a full stop before shots were fired.", "NTA, 16 is WAY too old to behave that way then try to play it as some kind of attack when you take the offending toy!", "\ud83d\udcaf!!!  Great advise!!", "Professional journalists are usually biased and all you need to do is check the stories reported by two different news papers of the same incident to see how much it vary. So no, the so called professional journalists report is worth nothing in most cases as truth is rarely told. Look for 'police activity' channel on youtube and compare it with the news paper reports to make up your own mind. Media do whatever it takes to get clicks and shares. These days they rarely care about the truth."]}
