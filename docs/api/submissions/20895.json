It was a happy relationship in the beginning but the longer we stayed together the more we realised that we just weren\u2019t right for each other. she admitted to me she didn\u2019t want kids and I was okay with that. Kids were not a dealbreaker for me. Sure one or two would have been nice but if I dated someone that hated them I could live with that. \n\nWell, around the time we broke up she announced that she was pregnant. We took all the preventative methods but it still happened. I can\u2019t lie though, I was over the moon. We decided to keep the baby but my ex told me that she wanted me to file for custody. She wanted to be in our child\u2019s life but she didn\u2019t want the responsibility of having a child around 24/7 which I completely respected. I offered her weekends only so she could focus on her career. She accepted with no hesitation. \n\nSoon enough the time came and we found out we were having a little girl. Now this really made my ex happy. She was really into the celebrity culture at the time and still is and was delighted with the idea of giving her a unique name because that seems to be the trend at the moment. She was obsessed with looking through unique baby name pages or coming up with unique ways to spell certain names. Eventually she came up with Paightynn-Starlight (said as Payton) and I instantly despised it. I expressed to her that I was not a fan and tried to suggest some more normal much nicer sounded names but no. She had her heart set and she wasn\u2019t budging. \n\nThe name was like marmite to a lot of people. Some loved it and some hated it but they never explicitly told her that for fear of upsetting her. The name had already caused a few arguments and she was the type of woman that posted statuses on Facebook a long the lines of \u2018if you don\u2019t like what I chose to name my daughter either suck it up or stay out of her life\u2019 kind of thing It broke my heart is having to go down to the registry office and announce that our daughters name was that monstrosity. I hate it to this day.\n\nFast forward to now. Our daughter is 2years old and I have full custody. She lives with me. Her mom sees her occasionally but most of the time makes excuses as to why she can\u2019t. I still hate the name with a passion. People told me I would grow to love it but I just can\u2019t. Now I\u2019ve looked into it and there is a way that I can change our child\u2019s name legally because I have full custody and My lawyer has been very helpful about the situation but when I told people I was considering it it caused a very mixed reaction. Some people agree with me while others think I should just suck it up. \n\nI just fear that her name is going to hinder her when she\u2019s an adult. With a name like that on professionals applications for jobs and colleges no one would ever take her seriously and I\u2019m terrified of what other kids will say. So what do you think? Is changing her name a bad idea?", "created_utc": 1688051769, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14m7n8s/aita_for_wanting_to_change_my_daughters_name/", "score": 668, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The child is going to be tormented its whole life with a name like Paightynn-Stalight (seriously wtf?). You should have had a say in the first place (or gotten to pick the name since you both knew you were going to be raising the child). I would personally change her name to Peyton so there isn't too much of an adjustment and the child can have some sense of normalcy. Your ex sucks.", "NTA but here are a couple of things to consider. At two years old she recognizes and identifies with her name. Consider keeping Peyton/Payton (yes, I normalized the spelling) and just change the spelling. Drop the Starlight part and give her a middle name that you like. \n\nOr, if you really don't like Peyton/Payton at all, make it her middle name (with a normal spelling) and still drop the Starlight part. Choose a first name that you like and fits her. Then you can gradually transition to using the first name.\n\n With either of those options, when she gets older she can decide which name she wants to use, her first name or her middle name.", "Change the name before she is too old. \n\nOr you could change her name to Payton with a normal spelling. \n\nYes - that name is going to cause her issues. Parents caught up in the celebrity nonsense don't think of the child.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Just a thought - change her first name to the normally spelled version of her name and make her middle name something YOU like. You could then call her by her middle name. She might prefer your tastes as well. Good luck.", "NTA\n\nSeriously, as a person with an unusual spelling of their name, I beg you to do this! My name is just an alternative spelling not even something cringey but I've spent my entire life spelling out my name to people.", "NTA - do your kid a favor and change it now, before they start being known by it at school. You sound like a stand up dad - nice one bro!", "NTA\n\nTo not want the child but want to be the one who decided the name is utterly preposterous. Change it.", "NTA,\n\nFor someone who didn\u2019t want the child\u2026the fact that she wouldn\u2019t budge on the name doesn\u2019t make sense. Going as far as choosing a unique name knowing she wouldn\u2019t be a part of this child\u2019s life. But most people don\u2019t make sense. Idk how the process is where you live, hopefully you don\u2019t need mothers permission. But yeah, that name is something to say the least. Since you have full custody, shouldn\u2019t be an issue. Better to do it now while she\u2019s still young.", "NTA. I'm pretty sure your daughter will thank you one day.", "NTA. Change it. She\u2019s still young enough that even if you want to change it entirely it probably wouldn\u2019t take too long for her to adjust. But AT THE VERY LEAST drop the starlight and change the first to the normal spelling of the name. That spelling your ex came up with is horrible and will cause your daughter so many problems.", "Maybe just drop the starlight shit but Payton normally spelled could be a good name", "NTA. Please change it for your daughters sake.", "\nJust go and do it. Don't tell anybody until it's done. \n\nYou're doing your daughter a favour getting rid of that trashy name.\n\nNTA", "NTA- change that right now do her a favor , she make her point clear about how involved she wanted to be i don\u2019t see why should be a problem for you to change YOUR daughters name", "NTA. Don't even need to do anything drastic. The obvious compromise would be \"Payton/Peyton\". Won't confuse anyone at all.", "NTA\n\nYou have full custody of the kid and if the mom really cared, she would show up on the weekends like she said she would. \n\nI would say as long as the name is similar enough to the name your kid responds to, it's cool. \"Paightynn-Starlight\" would 100% get her bullied in school.", "Change it! You\u2019re the custodial parent and she\u2019s still young enough to adapt something new!", "Just change it to Peyton.\n\nNTA", "oh man. NTA, just change it to payton and she'll never know the difference.", "NTA - You have custody and you are correct, it will be a name that can \"haunt\" her career, whatever that may be, in the future. Now is the time to change it because as she grows older it won't be as easy on her to change it - not saying it wouldn't be impossible, but just easier to do it while they are young. YOU are the decision maker in your daughter's life now. YOU need to do all you can to ensure her well-being both mentally and physically.", "change it. u have sole responsibility. u have sole authority. NTA. but u might be if ur daughter goes through those hurdle. be the parent ur ex could never be. be the king ur daughter needs.", "NTA. \n\nChange her name. If you have full custody, I don't understand why you're even hesitating? If it was just a regular name, I'd advise against it (after all, a name is a name and she did carry and birth the baby), but a name that makes it difficult for her to get a job or get into a college ...? It's insane that your ex even thought that was an acceptable thing to do.\n\nIf you're worried your daughter is too attached to the name, you can just shorten it, or come up with a more normal version. Like, Paige, for example.", "Wow your ex sounds like a piece of work. Such messed up priorities. It's for the best that her role is minimized in your daughter's life and your own. \n\nNTA for wanting to change it but I have to say you should have played a role in choosing the name to begin with. Maybe your ex was just SO extreme and difficult that it simply wasn't possible for you to. She sounds like someone who has gotten her way for a long, long time. \n\nChange the name. You're within your right, your daughter is still young enough that she won't remember, and as you note it most likely will be an impediment in the future if she keeps the current name. Ideally in my eyes you'd adopt some different form of Payton so that it eases the transition for her, versus an entirely different name, but I'm sure either way would be fine. \n\nPrepare for some drama from the baby mama, but just make sure your ducks are in a row legally and steel yourself for it.", "Nta\n\nChange it, your daughter will thank you.", "NTA. You are right that the name will cause problems for the kid in the future. A change to a simple, reasonable spelling would be something your daughter would never notice but would help her tremendously.", "NTA.\n\nPayton is a nice name. Maybe normalize the spelling. Your daughter is probably used to hearing herself referred to as Payton.\n\nStarlight. Ummmm. Maybe a synonym? Estella, Stella, Lyra\u2026. Google star names for girls. There\u2019s a lot to choose from. Absolutely, your daughter will thank you for changing it. And you would keep the spirit of her original middle name at least.", "NTA oh god how tf did she come up with that name??", "NTA what a tragedeigh of a name", "NTA. Change her name asap. Any name hyphenated with \u201cStarlight\u201d sounds like a stripper name and sadly, unless she works in the sex industry, this will absolutely hinder her career.", "NTA. My family called me a nickname for the first 6 or 7 years of my life, until I told them I wanted to be called by my actual name. That was because people at school used my actual name. So at 2 years old, you have time to make that transition. Or just change the spelling of her name. I actually think that Peyton Starlight is quite beautiful and special, without being odd (with Starlight as a middle name instead of a long first name.)", "Payton sounds much better!", "Maybe just change the spelling to Peyton and get rid of the hyphen. Keep Starlight as her middle name or just get rod of it all together \n\nShe's 2. She knows her name. It would be weird to start calling her Jane or whatever now.", "NTA - Legally go and change the spelling to Peyton. Make her middle name Starlight (true middle name, not a hyphenated first name). Even if her mother isn't in her life she might like having something her mom picked for her when she is older. And middle names don't matter. \n\nTBH - I don't think the current name would impact her school/job prospects and I don't think people would judger her. She didn't pick her name after all. But if you cannot get past this, this that is eventually going to rub off on her. And no kid should feel like they have to hate their name or that their existence is somehow related to a conflict.", "NTA\n\nYou have full custody and you're thinking of your daughter when she gets older.", "Do it", "Change it to Peyton Star. Still honors her mother\u2019s choice and what she is used to being called, but isn\u2019t so outrageous.", "Questions:\n\nWere the mother and you ever married?\n\nAre you getting child support payments from the mother? You should be.\n\nIf you are the legal guardian you should be able to change your daughter's name (even on her birth certificate).\n\nYou should hurry to change her name, before she gets too used to being called that \"monstrosity  of a moniker\" that her mother contrived - lol.", "NTA\n\nMy eldest was about 3 when his adoption was finalized. He also had a horrible name - similar to \"StoneFox Brock LName\" Yeah. (The real name was actually worse since it ended up being a homonym for a common construction product.)\n\nWe changed his name. There might have been a few confusing weeks when we were transitioning the name but the name change never caused him any problems.\n\nHe's in his 30s now and has expressed his gratitude for the name change several times. Now it's just a family joke.\n\nThe only problem we had was with his Bio-mom who threatened to take him back because we were awful parents for squashing his individuality. LOL", "This isn\u2019t her child - she has made it clear. She was interested in a superficial way.  Do what you feel is best for the child you are raising. \n\nShe has made herself irrelevant in her child\u2019s life. Therefore her opinion is irrelevant. NTA.", "Do it now while she's still very young. For what its worth, Payton is a cute name but that spelling is ridiculous.", "NTA at all.\n\nYour ex did not want a kid at the beginning. Then when she became pregnant she still did not want the kid. All she wanted was Facebook status.\n\nAnd she named your daughter that awful name purely for social media. And I would not be surprised if she takes the kid just long enough to take a bunch of pictures to post. So everyone can see that she is such a unique amazing mom without actually having to be there at all.\n\nPlease do your daughter a favor and change her name before it becomes all of the issues you foresee.", "NTA. I\u2019d go with Peyton or Payton, and for middle name, Dara (Sanskrit for star) or even Stella  (Italian for star).", "Just change her name. If you hate it, change it. NTA. The mom had a hissy fit about getting the name her way for a child she had no intention of parenting.", "If you call her a different name already, then change it. If not, I'd change the spelling to something more common/identifiable, you know, so someone reads it and doesn't have to spend time sounding it out and hoping they pronounce it right the first time. No kid likes to correct their teacher on the first day of class and it may be embarrassing for her. \n   \nIf you really just hate the name and not just the random letters thrown together to try to spell it, I'd still keep it as a middle name. People who will be part of her life forever will probably have a hard time making the switch, especially if they're stubborn and not cool with you changing it. I know some are going to say \"if they don't respect my decision on the name change and won't comply then they don't need to be in our lives.\" So easy for people not in your situation to cut off your family and friends for you. I don't think a name is the hill to die on for your relationships with others who just know this baby by that name and find a change weird because it's not common. Keep it as a middle name because then it's still her name and lots of people use their middle names. No big deal.\n   \nDrop the starlight moonbeam or whatever. That's one of those names given to ladies in adult entertainment, not a name given to her by her parents.\n   \nPayton/Peyton is a pretty common name in my kids' elementary school for both girls and boys (mosty girls) so it's not some far out unique made up word. Granted I'm in the Indianapolis area and Peyton Manning is still the darling of Hoosier families. \n   \nPayton is probably on the list of top 100 girl names you can find on a .gov website.\n   \nNTA, Mom insisted, you protested, now Mom is not much of a mom and Baby Girl is still young enough not to notice. I've known 2 people whose parents decided they didn't like the name anymore and changed it. One was 4 when she went from Amber to Jenny.", "NTA, what a dumb name and the mom isn\u2019t even in her life, so why did she get to make that decision, she just shot the kid out and gave her a dumb name and left.

Your daughter's mother should have respected that you didn't like the name, especially since you would be the one primarily raising her.   The name should have been one you both could agree on.  However I would say that changing now could be confusing for your daughter.  She's only 2 but I'm sure she already recognizes her name and identifies with it.  Perhaps like some have suggested change it to a more recognizable spelling such as Payton.  When she is a little older she can decide if she wants to totally change her name.   As far as concerns about her being teased or having a hard time in the future with jobs, that concern is overexaggerated.  So many kids have unique names and unique spellings now a days.
