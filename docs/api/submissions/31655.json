When we relocated I was in charge of selling her items on fb market bc according to her it wouldn\u2019t let her post them since she lived out of town.

It sounds like you have gotten so used to being taken advantage of that you feel you should apologise for not being a doormat.\n\nYou are doing the professional thing by giving notice. \n\nFree yourself and find work where you are valued and treated with respect. If you decide to work for yourself, do NOT buy her business. You are the only real asset she has. Let her deal with her broken fixtures and tax debts. Walk away.", "NTA. If you need to leave (heck even if you just want to leave), you are legally and morally able to do that at any point. If she was running the business right, she\u2019d have a contingency plan for covering/replacing staff. Of course she\u2019s stressed but that\u2019s not your responsibility, and doesn\u2019t sound like it will get any better whilst she\u2019s on maternity leave. 3 sessions in 15 minutes is a joke - you can\u2019t be expected to do good work in that time. \nI had a very similar job recently. Small clinic, business doubled in size from 4 to 8 clinics in the space of a week, the clinic I was working at was just left to rot (literally - black mould growing on the wall from a leak I\u2019d been reporting for over a year since I started there). Impossible time management expectations. Just felt icky charging people for rushed treatments in a health hazard. Every report I made fell on deaf ears and it was all because I wasn\u2019t \u201cgiving value\u201d - I worked 60 hours (paid for 40) every week just to keep up. \nLeave the job. Look after yourself. You don\u2019t exist to work yourself to the bone for a business owner that doesn\u2019t seem to give a shit about you or her clients. \nYou sound like a good person, hence the difficulty leaving when she\u2019s having a baby. But don\u2019t let the guilt trip get to you. You deserve a healthy work environment. And you gave your notice in over a month ago, she had time to organise a plan before you left!! \nGood luck with everything", "Good god, she sounds like a piece of work.  She\u2019s only gaslighting now because she doesn\u2019t have a backup plan despite ample notice that you were leaving.  Her business, her problem.  NTA.", "NTA - Caring goes both ways.  As soon as she refuses to resolve a reported safety issue, she\u2019s crossing a line.  \n\nBe very careful to make sure you aren\u2019t on the hook for any financials, especially the tax problem.

Wow - you need to respect yourself more and go. I wouldn't have given this bad boss any notice at all. She doesn't respect you at all (3 services in 15 minutes????). Run. You are in the right entirely. And block her number when you leave. This is the type to keep contacting you asking you to fill in/cover/work your ass off for free because she neeeeeeeeds you.", "NTA.  \n\n\nYou have a business relationship. If she wants to run a business and employ people then retention and staffing are her job to deal with, not yours. You don't owe an employer ANYTHING beyond your professional obligations, and staying at a job you don't like is not one of those obligations.", "NTA but the boss is. Her pregnancy is not your concern.", "Nta\n\nShe sounds like a crap boss, I think I wouldn't have even given her the notice.

This woman is absolutely taking advantage of you and even if she weren't, it would be unprofessional of her to speak to you the way she has in these emails.

This woman was an asshole long before getting pregnant, and of course she'll continue to drain you for as long as you let her.\n\nGet out while you can.

If she\u2019s having financial issues and overworking you the way you say and she\u2019s benefiting (and you\u2019re not) its ALWAYS time to reevaluate your work situation and look elsewhere if you feel its raised enough red flags to tell you its time to move on.\n\nNTA x100\u2026 sorry business is business.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My last job was much the same. The only difference was that I was working for a family member. So my leaving had quite the fallout and I\u2019m still getting messages about how I was awful and should have been the bigger person. My response is always along the lines of, \u201cI\u2019m happy with where I\u2019m at. If she\u2019s still stuck in the past then that\u2019s on her.\u201d", "Get out now!

It sucks bc these jobs will replace us in a heartbeat after everything we have done for them but working under these circumstances just makes work not enjoyable. I feel so rushed everyday & it\u2019s sucks bc I don\u2019t want ppl feeling like they\u2019re walking money. I am very passionate about my job & want to do a thorough job! Unfortunately it\u2019s true when they say a small business will do you worse than a big corporation", "Right\u2026. In her email she stated she was making 20k a month with just me working so where did all that money go..??", "My last day is at the end of December! I even had the decency to stay working for her to give her time to figure it out. She is also shutting this location down and keeping the one in her city open.", "Noooooo lol I\u2019m very anti MLM!", "Yes! That\u2019s exactly what my old coworker said when she quit", "Facts. Her email told me everything I needed to know, I know I am making the right decision parting ways.

You\u2019re completely right tho, I mean it\u2019s harder for small businesses to replace you (my old employer is still trying to hire someone months later, and I did feel awful for leaving my clients, but enoughs enough, yknow?). You obviously care about your clients, so branching off on your own is a great idea. Don\u2019t let her get in your head. Sounds like she was using you massively.", ">hank you so much for replying! It sucks bc these jobs will replace us in a heartbeat after everything we have done for them but working under these circumstances just makes work not enjoyable.\n\nAnd that, right there, is the reason to jump ship the moment you have a new job lined up. If this was a healthy employer-employee relationship I'd say give a solid 2 weeks notice but at this stage I'm not even sure it is worth that. Certainly don't give her the full month.", "Ikr either she\u2019s terrible at managing money and business expenses or she spends everything she makes.  Neither would surprise me since she owes the IRS money", "If she continues to harass you, change it to 2 weeks notice only. In the mean time, look for a new job. If you can start the new job sooner, get out of that job sooner.\n\nYou owe nothing to her. If she valued you she would treat you with respect and compensate you appropriately. She doesn't. \n\nFind a new job, quit your current job. It is her problem and ONLY her problem to staff appropriately. If she treated you with respect this might be a different situation but that is not how she has chosen to conduct her business.", "She didn\u2019t plan well and she thought she could keep exploiting you.

Safe to say I\u2019ve left now anyway.", "Oh and they also said \u201cit\u2019s not worth spending the money because the clinics not bringing in any money\u201d maybe cuz it\u2019s a death trap?! Gotta spend money to make money. Anyway at least I know what NOT to do if I decide to set up on my own.", "But she also told OP that the location was bringing in 20K a month. The gas bill must be over the moon.\n\nIf the boss owns the building, she won't get much because it's a nightmare to bring up to code. If the boss is renting, the landlord is not going to like the walk through.", "I might have missed something haha I\u2019m not OP and the black mould was in my old place of work. I\u2019ve not seen OP say there\u2019s black mould where she is/was."]}
