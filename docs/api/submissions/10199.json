They think he is buying me by giving me expensive gift. I think they are just jealous that my dad gives me things my siblings can't have and that he loves me more than they do\n\nEdit: ok so it seems like everyone agrees I shouldn't make my stepdad upset anymore so I won't make him upset anymore. My dad asked me to move in with him and I'm old enough to move in make that choice and I'm going to do it. According to the comments apparently I'm very insufferable so I'm going to do my mom and stepdad this favor. It's easy for you to say gifts don't equal love. If they don't then why did my half brothers get all the expensive gifts and I got all the cheap gifts? If money doesn't mean love why didn't I get the expensive gifts for once?

Be careful with the bio dad, though. He has a questionable track record as a parent. He has an obligation to explain his absence if he hasn't already. Gifts are easy if you've got the money to spend.

He didn't want anything to do with you until you were old enough to be fun to have around.

Absolutely nothing at all wrong with your reconnecting with your birth father, but that shouldn't have anything to do with your stepdad.  You've always called him \"Dad\" and you should continue to do so.  Discontinuing that is simply a slap in his face since he's the one who raised you.  \n\nAnd, it does indeed sound like you're choosing your birth father over Dad, when it really shouldn't be a contest.  Make room for your birth father without pushing Dad away.  \n\nThe best solution would be to have a variation on \"Dad\" to call your birth father...  Pa, Pop, etc.", "Little one, YTA.

Some part of their child will always crave their approval, even if they are not consciously aware of it.\n\nThat being said, to hurt the man who has raised you for 14 years because your biological father is getting pissy is an AH move. Your bio-parent is a grown man who is responsible for his own emotions and shouldn't be laying that on you. \n\nYour mum and stepdad aren't jealous.

My advice tho, don\u2019t ruin your relationship with your stepdad for a man who abandoned you for 14 years. You can have them both. If your bio dad gets upset at you for calling your stepdad your dad, then ask him where he was all those years.", "YTA - Your bio father really hasn't earned the right to be upset over that.   \n\nThink about it, why is he upset over calling someone else dad, why is he buying you expensive gifts?  He feels guilty because he turned his back on you.... everything he does is out of guilt and not love.  If he truly loved you he would understand that another man put in the work and has earned that title.   \n\nAt the end of the day you are letting him buy your love and using money to force a rift in your relationship to someone who has been there for you.

It doesn\u2019t sound like your stepdad did anything to make you feel unloved or less than the other kids.

Normally, I would say that you can call him step dad if YOU were no longer comfortable calling him that, but that\u2019s not the case here. It\u2019s your dad who is uncomfortable and it seems like something he should get over as a consequence of his actions. Unless your stepdad did something to make you feel distant, I think YTA.", "YTA - just think back to this post in a few years when you've matured and you'll know exactly why.", "Nah. Not going to call you an AH because this is a complex situation.  You and your bio dad are working in the relationship which isn't a bad thing.

Not your bio dad. \n\nYour stepdad has been with you and loved you through thick and thin for 14 years, and now your bio dad is trying to buy your love. No matter how much money he spends on you now, he can't buy back the time he was absent in your life. \n\nYour stepdad put in the time, the love, the effort, he earned the dad title, you should really think about that before abandoning him for the dad that skipped out for the first 16 years of your life. Money isn't everything, buying gifts makes him feel better because he feels guilty for not being there for you. Hearing you call your stepdad Dad is part of the price he should pay for not being in your life.\n\nEdit - I'm changing my vote. It sounds like step dad hasn't been all that great of a father either.

Frankly, I don't disagree with your mother and stepfather in the slightest for having a poor opinion of your sperm donor when he abandoned you so he live only for himself. Money is a poor substitute for love and care. I don't begrudge you wanting to get to know him, but just remember that he absolutely has it in him to abandon his own flesh and blood for selfish purposes, and he hasn't magically lost that capability just because he's well off economically.

That's giving a lot of people here red flags because it's typically not a good start to a relationship, especially if he isn't trying to make amends to you in other ways (you don't mention if he is or not, so I won't assume either way). I don't think it's inherently a bad thing for him to give you gifts or do nice things for you; some people struggle with finding ways to make amends for past mistakes without using money, and that may be your biodad's case. But it *could* be a bad sign for the future, and people want you to look out for that.\n\nDoes biodad do other things for you? Does he come to your sports games or ballet recitals or whatever? Do you get the impression he genuinely cares for you and wants to be in your life in the long term? Is he patient and caring with you even when you're having a shitty day and aren't pleasant to be around? These are much more important factors than how much money he spends on you.\n\nEven if those things are all true, I would still recommend preparing yourself for the possibility that your biodad dips out on you again at some point. Some people want a kid as an accessory or a friend or something, and they get bored of the kid eventually and then drop them.

He doesn't get to be \"your dad\" unless he's acted like a dad by caring about you emotionally and respecting you as a fellow human being.

As an adult, I've come to realize that I was a very confrontational teenage girl, the poor man had met his match for stubbornness, and he was trying to keep me safe because he was terrified for me as a girl in the world.", "Alot of assuming there buddy. You got a proof? I hate how reddits argument to anything is \u201coH bUt bUt trAumA\u201d like what if he just had sex got someone pregnant and left? Not everyone is a weirdo? You do realize people at the age of 18 can consent and have intercourse with people older than them?", "OP is a spoiled shit who doesn't give a fuck about a man who spent 14 years of his life taking care of a kid that was not even his. He didn't have to, but he did. Now he gets dumped like yesterday's garbage because looser dad who shows up after missing all the hard parts, wants to swoop in and buy this dumdum's love. She is letting him. OP is maybe one of the biggest assholes I have ever seen this in this sub.", "I think that's a different one, since it seems to be biodad abandoned and stepdad favored.", "So, you're ok with favouritism?", "I didn't choose it that's what I've done my whole life. They tought me to say it when I was a baby", "Maybe there wasn't favouritism in your case but I can see some misogyny...\n\nBecause I can't think of why I would let a younger boy do stuff, I'd stopped his older sister from doing....", "She was born when he was 18. So, 18 minus 9 months gets to either a very young 18 or 17.  It isn\u2019t that far-fetched. And being legally allowed and morally okay are entirely different things.", "Yes, 18 is a legal adult. But many that age are naive and dumb as wood. The man should not be forever branded by the way he behaved at 18. Stepdad, however, treated OP as less than as an actual adult who would be expected to have more maturity. Yes, there is a chance that bio dad could still be better at this stage.\nAnd, you just have to see the age difference at the time of the pregnancy to suspect grooming. That is indeed a gap maturity wise.", "But you'll give your bio dad a medal because you spoils you and buys you expensive gifts which he just does because of guilt and not out of love? Bs.", "He should definitely get more grace and respect than the person who abandoned you. \n\nTake it from someone who was abandoned by their Dad who also came back in to my life as a teen, you will eventually see it differently. Right now you\u2019re basking in all the attention being on you and being bought. You\u2019ll realise what\u2019s important soon enough and you better hope you haven\u2019t alienated the people who have always been there.", "Does your bio-dad deserve a medal for buying you expensive gifts instead of food, clothing and shelter for 16 years?!", "He should get your respect.  This guy paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to keep you alive while your deadbeat dad ignored you for a decade. Honestly yeah, he deserves a medal. You seem like a real ungrateful jerk.", "Considering how insufferable you sound, he deserves more than a medal for putting up with your material ass", "Yeah, he should. He NEVER had to do anything for you, you are not his kid... Like, what part of that is not clicking. The guy who DID have to because you ARE his kid, didn't give a fuck about you and bailed, but some stranger who didn't owe you SHIT has been making sure you ARE taken care for 14 years stepped up to the plate. Does he deserve a medal? You're damn right he does, but if he can't get that, maybe just some god damn gratitude?", "Don\u2019t change your life over random internet user comments. Nobody here knows shit about your life. \n\nJust take their opinions at face value.", "no, I just think it's objectively better than abandonment.", "I question your concept of favoritism given you admit to testing people by hurting them for prolonged periods of time (continually for MONTHS) to see if they \u201clove you\u201d enough to put up with it and still buy you things. \n\nYou realize if you intentionally hurt people an actual \u201cdad\u201d will punish you and correct your psychotic actions, right?  That isn\u2019t favoritism, that is just good parenting. \n\nI wish you the best, but I think this will comeback later in life to bite you hard in the ass. The people who are cheering you on here by making up BS fictitious scenarios don\u2019t actually care about about you, they are just bigots that want to hate on your SF. Don\u2019t mistake their comments for supporting your decision, they just want to live vicariously though your hurting of your SF.", "And I'm guessing if you had had the choice earlier, you have stopped calling him that before your biodad came back into the picture right?\n\nBut from your answers NTA, but be careful with biodad, like everyone said he is here now, but don't assume he'll stay...", "There's nothing misogynistic about being realistic about the many more dangers woman face than men do.", "Yes and no to misogyny, because my older sister (his step daughter) was also allowed to do stuff. He taught them both to drive, but didn't even let me get my license until I was 18, he taught them both how to shoot but nearly threatened an uncle who offered to teach me, and praised them both for working with fire crew companies but micromanaged me when I became a firefighter. I think the difference between my sister and I is that she set a clear \"step\" boundary, whereas I was \"his\" little girl.", "[removed]", "It's still going to leave psychological scars and resentment that might get expressed in this way.\n\nOP never actively chose to call her step-dad \"dad\". She is allowed to now feel like he doesn't deserve this title anymore.", "i agree this context should have been in the post", "So favouritism!!! That is CLEAR favouritism, with weird possessiveness on top!", "Well when one person has a fully developed brain and the other doesn\u2019t\u2026. But since you resorted to name calling, I\u2019m out.
