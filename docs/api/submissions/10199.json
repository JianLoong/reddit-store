Also she is only 16 and does not need to know how the world works.\n\nI don\u2019t have a specific answer because it feels like we are missing information here on relationships.\n\nJust a word of caution: try to not get \u201cbought\u201d by those nice gifts you get now, get to know him and understand why he left you and your mum back then.

Absolutely nothing at all wrong with your reconnecting with your birth father, but that shouldn't have anything to do with your stepdad.  You've always called him \"Dad\" and you should continue to do so.  Discontinuing that is simply a slap in his face since he's the one who raised you.  \n\nAnd, it does indeed sound like you're choosing your birth father over Dad, when it really shouldn't be a contest.

Some part of their child will always crave their approval, even if they are not consciously aware of it.\n\nThat being said, to hurt the man who has raised you for 14 years because your biological father is getting pissy is an AH move. Your bio-parent is a grown man who is responsible for his own emotions and shouldn't be laying that on you. \n\nYour mum and stepdad aren't jealous.

My advice tho, don\u2019t ruin your relationship with your stepdad for a man who abandoned you for 14 years. You can have them both. If your bio dad gets upset at you for calling your stepdad your dad, then ask him where he was all those years.", "YTA - Your bio father really hasn't earned the right to be upset over that.   \n\nThink about it, why is he upset over calling someone else dad, why is he buying you expensive gifts?  He feels guilty because he turned his back on you.... everything he does is out of guilt and not love.  If he truly loved you he would understand that another man put in the work and has earned that title.   \n\nAt the end of the day you are letting him buy your love and using money to force a rift in your relationship to someone who has been there for you.

It doesn\u2019t sound like your stepdad did anything to make you feel unloved or less than the other kids. It\u2019s a valid reason for your dad to have his feelings hurt, so saying he is just jealous is a bit cruel. Normally, I would say that you can call him step dad if YOU were no longer comfortable calling him that, but that\u2019s not the case here. It\u2019s your dad who is uncomfortable and it seems like something he should get over as a consequence of his actions. Unless your stepdad did something to make you feel distant, I think YTA.", "YTA - just think back to this post in a few years when you've matured and you'll know exactly why.", "Nah. Not going to call you an AH because this is a complex situation.  You and your bio dad are working in the relationship which isn't a bad thing.

Not your bio dad. \n\nYour stepdad has been with you and loved you through thick and thin for 14 years, and now your bio dad is trying to buy your love. No matter how much money he spends on you now, he can't buy back the time he was absent in your life. \n\nYour stepdad put in the time, the love, the effort, he earned the dad title, you should really think about that before abandoning him for the dad that skipped out for the first 16 years of your life. Money isn't everything, buying gifts makes him feel better because he feels guilty for not being there for you. Hearing you call your stepdad Dad is part of the price he should pay for not being in your life.\n\nEdit - I'm changing my vote. It sounds like step dad hasn't been all that great of a father either.

Frankly, I don't disagree with your mother and stepfather in the slightest for having a poor opinion of your sperm donor when he abandoned you so he live only for himself. Money is a poor substitute for love and care. I don't begrudge you wanting to get to know him, but just remember that he absolutely has it in him to abandon his own flesh and blood for selfish purposes, and he hasn't magically lost that capability just because he's well off economically.
