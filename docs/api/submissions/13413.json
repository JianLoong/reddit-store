I (23F at the time) tell her it\u2019s not an appropriate time to be asking and I have a ton on my plate with being my moms oldest that I\u2019m not really concerned about a crochet bag right now. She just kind of laughs it off and we left it at that. Well the day comes and I\u2019m woken up by some neighbors who had been helping us take care of my mom in her final days, telling me that she had passed away that morning (7:30AM roughly). I gather my kids and my sisters and we head off to the hospice where her body is to say our last goodbyes before she\u2019s taken to the morgue. Obviously it was a crazy day for me, emotions were high. Anyways, it\u2019s about noon, I\u2019m back home with my sisters and kids when I get a text from my cousin.

I told her no she can not have the crochet bag I don\u2019t care how close they had gotten and she needed to leave me alone. After that I blocked her. It got brought up later that same day and I told my dad (my parents had been divorced for years) what I had said and his jaw hit the floor asking if I was joking. When I said no I wasn\u2019t joking what she did was messed up and it\u2019s not my problem my whole family basically freaked out on me saying I was an asshole for treating her that way.

AITA?\n\nEdit: I really appreciate everyone\u2019s honest responses, my family is toxic to say the very least and I\u2019ve gotten shit for this interaction since it happened and I\u2019ve really wondered if I took it too far", "created_utc": 1680021286, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/124uimm/aita_for_telling_off_my_cousin_and_blocking_her/", "score": 572, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your cousin is a gross vulture.", "NTA.", "NTA your cousin is a Vulture.", "NTA. And if she was so close to your mother, why was she asking you for the bag? Why wasn't she asking your mother? I mean, she was still alive and present at that time, so it seems weird to ask you. But regardless, the timing was terrible and she seems rather gross.", "NTA but it's probably not the hill to die on; I'd just check the bag and make sure it's just crochet stuff and then toss that bad boy her way for the sake of family peace.", "ESH. Your cousin was completely in the wrong. Every single time she brought up the crochet bag. She didn't respect you or your boundaries. She didn't empathize with your situation. I understand your emotions were running high but I do think you could've responded better and let yourself cool off a bit. The fact that 4 years has passed is wild to me. Do you plan on never speaking again? Did she ever apologize for hounding you?", "YTA - I'd be surprised if your mom and cousin hadn't spoken about this before your mom passed.  And maybe your cousin's timing was bad for you, but she was grieving too and wanted something of your mom's to help her cope.  \n\nI can't stress how poorly you handled the request.  Yes, losing a parent sucks and hurts, and making funeral arrangements is awful.  That does not give you license to be an asshat to everyone else who is dealing with things in their own ways.  It's not like your cousin was asking for a copy of the will or to stop by and pick up the antique baby grand piano.  It was a crochet bag.  Which you probably threw away.", "Yes I told them what she said/did at the dinner party a few weeks previous. They freaked out on me because \u201cit\u2019s just crochet stuff it\u2019s not that big of a deal\u201d. No she was not close to her until about 6-8 months before her passing. My mom was diagnosed when I was 11 making my cousin about 16 ish in age.", "That\u2019s what I thought as well. My mom also did a will down to some of the most minute details and the crochet bag was never mentioned. I\u2019m sorry this has happened to you as well. It\u2019s insane how \u201cfamily\u201d act during the hardest time in life", "Honestly that\u2019s a great question. The first time she asked, my mom was standing 5 ft away from me and she had every opportunity to talk with her about it yet never did", "No we\u2019ve never spoken about the issue. I\u2019ve seen her once in person since then but never reached out. After my mom passed it really split the family and my dads side doesn\u2019t speak to my moms side", "I agree I was definitely rude to my cousin and could have handled things differently. However I was the one living with my mom for the 2 years before she passed, I was her sole care provider with help every once in a while. My cousin never came to help me administer her medications breathing apparatus clean or help her eat etc. I felt it was incredibly disrespectful to not even be there to help out but then immediately want her possessions not even a full day after her passing", "Definitely NTA. And it's not just stuff. It's the principle. Your mother wasn't even dead before you had to deal with the first vulture wanting to pick through her things. She should have been trying to comfort you and your mother but she was clearly too selfish.", "That was unacceptable of her. NTA", "Honestly, I think it really depends on if you feel like salvaging the relationship. I'm not really close with my cousins and I'm okay with it. I guess maybe if she wasn't blocked...there's a possibility she would have tried to apologize? But who knows...", "I\u2019m a knitter and when we lost someone in our community several people got together and distributed the half finished projects so they could be completed. They agreed in advance if each item would stay with that person as a memorial, or be returned to the family.\n\nSo you\u2019re right, it\u2019s not just stuff and cousin is way out of line", "She was in the middle of several projects that she was doing for charity in conjunction with her church groups. All of her unfinished projects were distributed to the mothers and women in her ward and everyone finished them and sent them off, so it wasn\u2019t like her crochet things were just going to be thrown out. It was just such a messy situation for everyone involved", "NTA. Before mom's stroke, my aunt gave her a box of old family photos. When she was in a coma, auntie asked, when I was cleaning out the house she asked, after her funeral she asked. It was horrible. She walked into the church before mom's funeral and wiped off mom's lipstick. \n\nShe and mom had split up grandma's stuff and she felt that she was more entitled to some things than I was and kept trying to take them \n\nThere were a lot of other horrible things and people", "NTA Your family is mad at the wrong person. It should be your cousin they should be mad at. The audacity of asking you BEFORE your mother's death AND WITHIN earshot of her! Of course you told her off. I would have done exactly the same thing as you. My condolences on your loss. May peace and love be with you.", "NTA. Your cousin sounds like my aunt, who only cares about what she will get from her mom (my grandma) when she passes.\n\nIf your family doesn't know what happened before you blocked her, maybe fill them in if you're comfortable with it. If they do know, then they need to realize how rude she was being and that you aren't to blame.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry for your loss. There is a time and place for things. This was neither.", "Was there any emotional attachment that your cousin had to your mom's crochet stuff? I.e. your mom had taught her how to crochet and they'd spent hours together doing the hobby? Otherwise it just seems like she was in it for the stuff.", "You should've told your cousin she wanted to be buried with it.", "That\u2019s the right choice. Definitely messy, but nothing you did was AH behavior.", "NTA - I\u2019d have done the same thing. My grandmother passed and while her body was cooling in the other room, my Aunt started talking about her stuff. I pissed off their whole side of the family with \u201cCan we let her body chill before the vultures start pecking? This is a bit much\u2026\u201d", "Is it possible she just felt like it was more polite to ask you and she did ask your mom? They were close and as objective as it is insensitive to bring up, I feel like it could\u2019ve \nbeen the cousin was just concerned that if they didn\u2019t speak up it would get snatched up by someone? I know that sounds bad but I have nothing from\nMy great uncle and grandfather who were like my dad bc my grandma just got rid of all their stuff. Like they died and she was giving it to the neighbors or I ask her to hold on to it until I move and she was like no, even though there was room/ I really get the feeling I need more context like how she asked and if it meant a lot to her, like maybe she wanted to make something with it for family, maybe they were really helping out and her question didn\u2019t out weigh the good? At least not to the ppl who you say it to. I understand you\u2019re upset, truly I just have more questions when something is so much more than a quick interaction where the asshole is obvious. Lastly I just want to say that I am so sorry for your loss, maybe reach out to her but say I was uncomfortable about feeling pushed to give my dying then dead mothers stuff away.  Sorry again op.", "If cousin and your mom were close, the crochet bag could be a cherished memento that means zero to you and a lot to your cousin.  If this is the case, it would be nice to let her have it.\n\nThat said, check the bag to see if anything unusual is hidden in it.", "NTA promise anyone whose given you guff about this, that youll be there, waiting for their possessions while on their death bed. hell, ask if you can have it now! theyll be dead eventually.", "NTA and to add to this please PLEASE do not reward toxic behavior. I\u2019m so floored to see responses telling you to give her the bag to \u201ckeep the peace.\u201d Hard. No. You shouldn\u2019t have to essentially apologize to her for her super gross behavior. \n\nDeath can really bring out the worst in people. The greediest know no bounds. You had clearly told her prior that it was inappropriate and anyone with a brain would know that asking again so quickly after the passing is still inappropriate. You absolutely deserve an apology from your cousin. The selfish audacity of it all for her to put wanting a bag over the grief you were dealing with. You deserved better and I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.", "Your cousin was being a completely selfish ghoul.

Cuz asks again: because she\u2019s gone now. \n\nOP, I am sorry for your loss. Cuz is an absolute tone-deaf piece of work.", "NTA.  What a weirdo.  At this point I would send the whole family of me burning the bag just as a mike drop.", "NTA If someone let alone my cousin did this when my dad died let\u2019s say lots of violence would have been used.", "NTA", "NTA.\nI hope you kept the bag or passed it onto someone else.\nShe didn\u2019t deserve it.", "NTA", "It is clear your family is very toxic if they think that behaviour is ok.\n\nNTA", "NTA. I have a cousin who\u2019s the same way. I have another cousin, whom I\u2019m very close to, that lost his mom and grandmother in the same year. As an only child, everything went to him.  He\u2019s sick and possibly may not live many more years. This other cousin has been constantly telling him that her mother, our aunt\u2026his grandmother\u2019s sister, wants the house when he\u2019s gone.  Our aunt has dementia, probably mid stage from what I\u2019ve heard and doesn\u2019t need a house, yet her daughter keeps going on and on about it. Well, at the moment, the cousin is in his will, along with myself. He told me today he\u2019s fed up with our cousin and going to change his will and not leave her anything. It\u2019s sad that people are so greedy that they can\u2019t even wait until after the funeral ( not that that\u2019s a good time either) to ask for something.", "Agreed. NTA.", "So you\u2019re clearly the toxic person in your family, eh? What a terrible take.", "She didn\u2019t teach her how to crochet but they had done the craft together over the last few months of my moms life. So yes I\u2019m sure she cared about them to some extent. The bag it self was a large shoulder tote with some crochet hooks and several skeins of yarn. So not super expensive probably around $150 total. I honestly wasn\u2019t even really upset with what she wanted but how she asked me and went about it.", "NTA. I\u2019m so very sorry for your loss.\n\nWhen my grandma died in a similar way (hospice, we all expected it but it\u2019s still insanely painfully hard), no one would ever think to speak that way.

So about that crochet stuff\u2026\u201d \n\nThe fact that this is how she approached it AFTER you got mad at the dinner is disgusting.

I don\u2019t care that\u2019s it was \u201cjust a bag\u201d the fact she was planning what would be hers before your mother even passed is disgusting. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the only reason she came around and got close with your mom in the end was just to see what she could get, that\u2019s how her actions come across atleast. Screw anyone who gives you crap for how you responded to someone\u2019s tactless money grabbing actions. She has no heart whatsoever not for your mom and definitely not for you and your siblings in the time following her death.", "NTA.  What a toxic family!!!  Block all, every single one, of them!", "NTA.     When the will is read, then she knows if she can have your mom's belongings.    Until that  time, bringing it up while the person is still alive and just after their death is not the appropriate time and in poor taste.", "NTA. Your cousin should have waited until after the funeral and after you had some time to grieve.", "I'll never forget when my mom was near the end of her life after her fight with cancer.

It's not something to be mad about for years. She wanted something of sentimental value and not something valuable.", "There is a proper time and way to ask for something like that.  The time is at least a couple days after the funeral.  You don't demand the item, especially a niece when there are multiple children and grandchildren.  You ask if you can have it if no one else wants it and maybe add a story or two about the time you spent with the loved one and maybe how much it would mean to you.

If she wasn't supposed to ask before your mom passed, and she wasn't supposed to ask after your mom passed, when would have been the appropriate time? I feel like your cousin was just worried the bag might get cleaned out with the rest of the estate and/or lost. You weren't emotionally able to handle her request at that time, and that's okay, too. \n\nMy opinion is largely based on what happened after my grandma passed away. My sister who lived out of state felt upset that she didn't end up with a small, inexpensive item from one of grandma's collections. We weren't trying to keep her out of the loop or away from grandma's stuff; we were just trying to get things handled. We had asked Sis about other stuff, and she had mentioned certain other things she wanted us to keep for her, which we did, but that particular item just fell through the cracks -- she never brought it up, and we neglected to tell her when the collection was being boxed up to get donated.", "NTA\n\nI have first cousins I havent seen or spoke to since the 90s for no real good reason.", "I'm a knitter. If I got close to a family member who was also into knitting, and knowing that no one in the family cares about the hobby, I would definitely ask for the knitting bag before it gets thrown away as \"some unimportant crap\". \n\nIt's not like she asked for money or some expensive stuff.

She's a disgusting person and your family is just as bad for thinking that way. I'd suggest not talking to them for awhile because they don't deserve you if they can't treat you like a human being.\n\nThe only acceptable time to ask you would be if she politely requested to talk when you had the stability to do so.

The bag wasn\u2019t important enough for the mom to will it to someone. It\u2019s only value is sentimental (as a knitter I don\u2019t put much stock in the $150 estimate OP put on it). Cousin may have been afraid it was going to get tossed. My mom cleaned out my dad\u2019s stuff seemingly overnight when he died. If you weren\u2019t quick, a lot of sentimental items would have gotten tossed.

That cousin should have sent you a sympathy card and mentioned VERY briefly that if it was not already promised elsewhere, she would love to have the bag as a remembrance.  Asking before your mother passed was rude and repeating the ask on the day she passed was just plain disrespectful.  Keep her blocked.", "So sorry for the loss of your mother.
