We all knew she was going to pass away soon and had gathered family for goodbyes and remembrances. Well 2 weeks before my mom had even passed, her whole side of the family was over for a dinner party. My oldest cousin(30ishF) (oldest daughter of moms sister) had gotten kind of close with her over the past few months and while my mom is within earshot starts asking me if she can have her crochet bag and accessories after her passing. I (23F at the time) tell her it\u2019s not an appropriate time to be asking and I have a ton on my plate with being my moms oldest that I\u2019m not really concerned about a crochet bag right now. She just kind of laughs it off and we left it at that. Well the day comes and I\u2019m woken up by some neighbors who had been helping us take care of my mom in her final days, telling me that she had passed away that morning (7:30AM roughly). I gather my kids and my sisters and we head off to the hospice where her body is to say our last goodbyes before she\u2019s taken to the morgue. Obviously it was a crazy day for me, emotions were high. Anyways, it\u2019s about noon, I\u2019m back home with my sisters and kids when I get a text from my cousin. It was kind of long but basically she just sandwiches the question about the crochet bag between half assed apologies for losing my mom. I was furious. I did not care anymore and I told her off. Basically saying how inappropriate I thought it was of her to constantly be asking for my moms possessions while in the middle of planning her funeral and dealing with everything I was at the time. I told her no she can not have the crochet bag I don\u2019t care how close they had gotten and she needed to leave me alone. After that I blocked her. It got brought up later that same day and I told my dad (my parents had been divorced for years) what I had said and his jaw hit the floor asking if I was joking. When I said no I wasn\u2019t joking what she did was messed up and it\u2019s not my problem my whole family basically freaked out on me saying I was an asshole for treating her that way. I know I was definitely rude to my cousin but I feel my actions were justified. It\u2019s been almost 4 years since my mom passed and I haven\u2019t spoken to my cousin since then. Every time I gets brought up I\u2019m always the one people are upset with. AITA?\n\nEdit: I really appreciate everyone\u2019s honest responses, my family is toxic to say the very least and I\u2019ve gotten shit for this interaction since it happened and I\u2019ve really wondered if I took it too far", "created_utc": 1680021286, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/124uimm/aita_for_telling_off_my_cousin_and_blocking_her/", "score": 206, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Does your family know everything that led up to you telling her off? \n\nWas she close to your mother before she got sick? I'm sorry, but some people see someone terminal and think of it only as an opportunity. If this is your cousin, it would be hard for your family to admit it. If so, blocking her was the only thing you could do, especially when you were going through such a difficult time.", "NTA - No, just no. Who does that? Your response may have been cut-throat, but people need to realise how utterly disrespectful it is for someone to come grovelling for a bit of the \u201cgoods\u201d after your parent died. Not only that, but asking for it while you\u2019re grieving and dealing with the funeral is despicable. \n\nIf she loved your mum, she would have had more words for her in the message, and not her bag. Sure, she might have wanted it, maybe was promised it, but the timing was terrible, not once but twice.

Your cousin is a gross vulture.", "NTA.", "NTA your cousin is a Vulture.", "NTA. And if she was so close to your mother, why was she asking you for the bag? Why wasn't she asking your mother? I mean, she was still alive and present at that time, so it seems weird to ask you. But regardless, the timing was terrible and she seems rather gross.", "NTA but it's probably not the hill to die on; I'd just check the bag and make sure it's just crochet stuff and then toss that bad boy her way for the sake of family peace.", "ESH. Your cousin was completely in the wrong. Every single time she brought up the crochet bag. She didn't respect you or your boundaries. She didn't empathize with your situation. I understand your emotions were running high but I do think you could've responded better and let yourself cool off a bit. The fact that 4 years has passed is wild to me. Do you plan on never speaking again? Did she ever apologize for hounding you?", "YTA - I'd be surprised if your mom and cousin hadn't spoken about this before your mom passed.  And maybe your cousin's timing was bad for you, but she was grieving too and wanted something of your mom's to help her cope.  \n\nI can't stress how poorly you handled the request.  Yes, losing a parent sucks and hurts, and making funeral arrangements is awful.  That does not give you license to be an asshat to everyone else who is dealing with things in their own ways.  It's not like your cousin was asking for a copy of the will or to stop by and pick up the antique baby grand piano.  It was a crochet bag.  Which you probably threw away.", "Yes I told them what she said/did at the dinner party a few weeks previous. They freaked out on me because \u201cit\u2019s just crochet stuff it\u2019s not that big of a deal\u201d. No she was not close to her until about 6-8 months before her passing. My mom was diagnosed when I was 11 making my cousin about 16 ish in age.", "That\u2019s what I thought as well. My mom also did a will down to some of the most minute details and the crochet bag was never mentioned. I\u2019m sorry this has happened to you as well. It\u2019s insane how \u201cfamily\u201d act during the hardest time in life", "Honestly that\u2019s a great question. The first time she asked, my mom was standing 5 ft away from me and she had every opportunity to talk with her about it yet never did", "No we\u2019ve never spoken about the issue. I\u2019ve seen her once in person since then but never reached out. After my mom passed it really split the family and my dads side doesn\u2019t speak to my moms side", "I agree I was definitely rude to my cousin and could have handled things differently. However I was the one living with my mom for the 2 years before she passed, I was her sole care provider with help every once in a while. My cousin never came to help me administer her medications breathing apparatus clean or help her eat etc. I felt it was incredibly disrespectful to not even be there to help out but then immediately want her possessions not even a full day after her passing", "Definitely NTA. And it's not just stuff. It's the principle. Your mother wasn't even dead before you had to deal with the first vulture wanting to pick through her things. She should have been trying to comfort you and your mother but she was clearly too selfish.", "That was unacceptable of her. NTA", "Honestly, I think it really depends on if you feel like salvaging the relationship. I'm not really close with my cousins and I'm okay with it. I guess maybe if she wasn't blocked...there's a possibility she would have tried to apologize? But who knows...", "I\u2019m a knitter and when we lost someone in our community several people got together and distributed the half finished projects so they could be completed. They agreed in advance if each item would stay with that person as a memorial, or be returned to the family.\n\nSo you\u2019re right, it\u2019s not just stuff and cousin is way out of line", "She was in the middle of several projects that she was doing for charity in conjunction with her church groups. All of her unfinished projects were distributed to the mothers and women in her ward and everyone finished them and sent them off, so it wasn\u2019t like her crochet things were just going to be thrown out. It was just such a messy situation for everyone involved", "NTA. Before mom's stroke, my aunt gave her a box of old family photos. When she was in a coma, auntie asked, when I was cleaning out the house she asked, after her funeral she asked. It was horrible. She walked into the church before mom's funeral and wiped off mom's lipstick. \n\nShe and mom had split up grandma's stuff and she felt that she was more entitled to some things than I was and kept trying to take them \n\nThere were a lot of other horrible things and people", "NTA Your family is mad at the wrong person. It should be your cousin they should be mad at. The audacity of asking you BEFORE your mother's death AND WITHIN earshot of her! Of course you told her off. I would have done exactly the same thing as you. My condolences on your loss. May peace and love be with you.", "NTA. Your cousin sounds like my aunt, who only cares about what she will get from her mom (my grandma) when she passes.\n\nIf your family doesn't know what happened before you blocked her, maybe fill them in if you're comfortable with it. If they do know, then they need to realize how rude she was being and that you aren't to blame.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry for your loss. There is a time and place for things. This was neither.", "Was there any emotional attachment that your cousin had to your mom's crochet stuff? I.e. your mom had taught her how to crochet and they'd spent hours together doing the hobby? Otherwise it just seems like she was in it for the stuff.", "You should've told your cousin she wanted to be buried with it.", "That\u2019s the right choice. Definitely messy, but nothing you did was AH behavior.", "NTA - I\u2019d have done the same thing. My grandmother passed and while her body was cooling in the other room, my Aunt started talking about her stuff. I pissed off their whole side of the family with \u201cCan we let her body chill before the vultures start pecking? This is a bit much\u2026\u201d", "Is it possible she just felt like it was more polite to ask you and she did ask your mom? They were close and as objective as it is insensitive to bring up, I feel like it could\u2019ve \nbeen the cousin was just concerned that if they didn\u2019t speak up it would get snatched up by someone? I know that sounds bad but I have nothing from\nMy great uncle and grandfather who were like my dad bc my grandma just got rid of all their stuff. Like they died and she was giving it to the neighbors or I ask her to hold on to it until I move and she was like no, even though there was room/ I really get the feeling I need more context like how she asked and if it meant a lot to her, like maybe she wanted to make something with it for family, maybe they were really helping out and her question didn\u2019t out weigh the good? At least not to the ppl who you say it to. I understand you\u2019re upset, truly I just have more questions when something is so much more than a quick interaction where the asshole is obvious. Lastly I just want to say that I am so sorry for your loss, maybe reach out to her but say I was uncomfortable about feeling pushed to give my dying then dead mothers stuff away.  Sorry again op.", "If cousin and your mom were close, the crochet bag could be a cherished memento that means zero to you and a lot to your cousin.  If this is the case, it would be nice to let her have it.\n\nThat said, check the bag to see if anything unusual is hidden in it.", "NTA promise anyone whose given you guff about this, that youll be there, waiting for their possessions while on their death bed. hell, ask if you can have it now! theyll be dead eventually.", "NTA and to add to this please PLEASE do not reward toxic behavior. I\u2019m so floored to see responses telling you to give her the bag to \u201ckeep the peace.\u201d Hard. No. You shouldn\u2019t have to essentially apologize to her for her super gross behavior. \n\nDeath can really bring out the worst in people. The greediest know no bounds. You had clearly told her prior that it was inappropriate and anyone with a brain would know that asking again so quickly after the passing is still inappropriate. You absolutely deserve an apology from your cousin. The selfish audacity of it all for her to put wanting a bag over the grief you were dealing with. You deserved better and I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.", "Your cousin was being a completely selfish ghoul. NTA", "NTA. \n\nCuz asked while mom was ill; OP says \u201cshe\u2019s not even gone yet.\u201d  \n\nMom\u2019s gone for two hours. Cuz asks again: because she\u2019s gone now. \n\nOP, I am sorry for your loss. Cuz is an absolute tone-deaf piece of work.", "NTA.  What a weirdo.  At this point I would send the whole family of me burning the bag just as a mike drop.", "NTA If someone let alone my cousin did this when my dad died let\u2019s say lots of violence would have been used.", "NTA", "NTA.\nI hope you kept the bag or passed it onto someone else.\nShe didn\u2019t deserve it.", "NTA", "It is clear your family is very toxic if they think that behaviour is ok.\n\nNTA", "NTA. I have a cousin who\u2019s the same way. I have another cousin, whom I\u2019m very close to, that lost his mom and grandmother in the same year. As an only child, everything went to him.  He\u2019s sick and possibly may not live many more years. This other cousin has been constantly telling him that her mother, our aunt\u2026his grandmother\u2019s sister, wants the house when he\u2019s gone.  Our aunt has dementia, probably mid stage from what I\u2019ve heard and doesn\u2019t need a house, yet her daughter keeps going on and on about it. Well, at the moment, the cousin is in his will, along with myself. He told me today he\u2019s fed up with our cousin and going to change his will and not leave her anything. It\u2019s sad that people are so greedy that they can\u2019t even wait until after the funeral ( not that that\u2019s a good time either) to ask for something.", "Agreed. NTA.", "So you\u2019re clearly the toxic person in your family, eh? What a terrible take.", "She didn\u2019t teach her how to crochet but they had done the craft together over the last few months of my moms life. So yes I\u2019m sure she cared about them to some extent. The bag it self was a large shoulder tote with some crochet hooks and several skeins of yarn. So not super expensive probably around $150 total. I honestly wasn\u2019t even really upset with what she wanted but how she asked me and went about it."]}
