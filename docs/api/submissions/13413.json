We all knew she was going to pass away soon and had gathered family for goodbyes and remembrances. Well 2 weeks before my mom had even passed, her whole side of the family was over for a dinner party. My oldest cousin(30ishF) (oldest daughter of moms sister) had gotten kind of close with her over the past few months and while my mom is within earshot starts asking me if she can have her crochet bag and accessories after her passing. I (23F at the time) tell her it\u2019s not an appropriate time to be asking and I have a ton on my plate with being my moms oldest that I\u2019m not really concerned about a crochet bag right now. She just kind of laughs it off and we left it at that. Well the day comes and I\u2019m woken up by some neighbors who had been helping us take care of my mom in her final days, telling me that she had passed away that morning (7:30AM roughly). I gather my kids and my sisters and we head off to the hospice where her body is to say our last goodbyes before she\u2019s taken to the morgue. Obviously it was a crazy day for me, emotions were high. Anyways, it\u2019s about noon, I\u2019m back home with my sisters and kids when I get a text from my cousin. It was kind of long but basically she just sandwiches the question about the crochet bag between half assed apologies for losing my mom. I was furious. I did not care anymore and I told her off. Basically saying how inappropriate I thought it was of her to constantly be asking for my moms possessions while in the middle of planning her funeral and dealing with everything I was at the time. I told her no she can not have the crochet bag I don\u2019t care how close they had gotten and she needed to leave me alone. After that I blocked her. It got brought up later that same day and I told my dad (my parents had been divorced for years) what I had said and his jaw hit the floor asking if I was joking. When I said no I wasn\u2019t joking what she did was messed up and it\u2019s not my problem my whole family basically freaked out on me saying I was an asshole for treating her that way. I know I was definitely rude to my cousin but I feel my actions were justified. It\u2019s been almost 4 years since my mom passed and I haven\u2019t spoken to my cousin since then. Every time I gets brought up I\u2019m always the one people are upset with. AITA?\n\nEdit: I really appreciate everyone\u2019s honest responses, my family is toxic to say the very least and I\u2019ve gotten shit for this interaction since it happened and I\u2019ve really wondered if I took it too far", "created_utc": 1680021286, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/124uimm/aita_for_telling_off_my_cousin_and_blocking_her/", "score": 112, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not to mention the day of her death. You have every right to block her.", "NTA. Does your family know everything that led up to you telling her off? \n\nWas she close to your mother before she got sick? I'm sorry, but some people see someone terminal and think of it only as an opportunity. If this is your cousin, it would be hard for your family to admit it. If so, blocking her was the only thing you could do, especially when you were going through such a difficult time.", "NTA - No, just no. Who does that? Your response may have been cut-throat, but people need to realise how utterly disrespectful it is for someone to come grovelling for a bit of the \u201cgoods\u201d after your parent died. Not only that, but asking for it while you\u2019re grieving and dealing with the funeral is despicable. \n\nIf she loved your mum, she would have had more words for her in the message, and not her bag. Sure, she might have wanted it, maybe was promised it, but the timing was terrible, not once but twice. She could have been grieving, true, but she isn\u2019t stupid, she knows that would have been disrespectful considering she was told off already. She ignored you when you said it was inappropriate, then proceeded to cross that boundary again.", "NTA. I hate death, it's bad enough without bringing out the vultures.", "NTA. At all. What she did was cold and inappropriate. To bring up material possessions on the day of her death is twisted, and you had every right to block her and tell her no.", "NTA.. I had family like this as well when my grandma passed.  \n\nEven if your cousin and mom had discussed it, as the main care giver you would of been told about it.\n\nMy grandma left everything to my mom.. And gave her a lot of things to give to  other family members.\n It was all typed out with full names listed of who was getting it.\n\n Basically an unofficial/official will.   We did a video  recording of my grandma saying who got what with mom filling out the paperwork. \n\n\n I found out the people that were upset with how we did stuff was the vultures of the family.  \n They never help with taking gram to docs, never helped with the yard work, never help to give my mother a day off...., just never helped in general.\n\n Left it all to my mother and me.. and I was 10 at the time.", "NTA.  Your cousin is not only an AH but inconsiderate as well.  Most people wait until the body is cold and buried before they go nuts over the deceased possessions.", "NTA.\nMy mother recently passed away and if any of my cousins had used their condolences ON THE DAY OF HER DEATH to ask for material things, I too would have blocked them. How self-centered is she to even ask this?\n\nEdited for clarity.", "NTA--IF that would have been me, I would have been LIVID and smacked her. How dare she ask for things when someone is DYING!! \n\nYour cousin had no compassion for you or the situation.\n\nLeave her in the dust!", "Check the crochet bag for hidden jewelry or money and give it to her.

Your cousin is a gross vulture.", "NTA.", "NTA your cousin is a Vulture.", "NTA. And if she was so close to your mother, why was she asking you for the bag? Why wasn't she asking your mother? I mean, she was still alive and present at that time, so it seems weird to ask you. But regardless, the timing was terrible and she seems rather gross.", "NTA but it's probably not the hill to die on; I'd just check the bag and make sure it's just crochet stuff and then toss that bad boy her way for the sake of family peace.", "ESH. Your cousin was completely in the wrong. Every single time she brought up the crochet bag. She didn't respect you or your boundaries. She didn't empathize with your situation. I understand your emotions were running high but I do think you could've responded better and let yourself cool off a bit. The fact that 4 years has passed is wild to me. Do you plan on never speaking again? Did she ever apologize for hounding you?", "YTA - I'd be surprised if your mom and cousin hadn't spoken about this before your mom passed.  And maybe your cousin's timing was bad for you, but she was grieving too and wanted something of your mom's to help her cope.  \n\nI can't stress how poorly you handled the request.  Yes, losing a parent sucks and hurts, and making funeral arrangements is awful.  That does not give you license to be an asshat to everyone else who is dealing with things in their own ways.  It's not like your cousin was asking for a copy of the will or to stop by and pick up the antique baby grand piano.  It was a crochet bag.  Which you probably threw away.", "Yes I told them what she said/did at the dinner party a few weeks previous. They freaked out on me because \u201cit\u2019s just crochet stuff it\u2019s not that big of a deal\u201d. No she was not close to her until about 6-8 months before her passing. My mom was diagnosed when I was 11 making my cousin about 16 ish in age.", "That\u2019s what I thought as well. My mom also did a will down to some of the most minute details and the crochet bag was never mentioned. I\u2019m sorry this has happened to you as well. It\u2019s insane how \u201cfamily\u201d act during the hardest time in life", "Honestly that\u2019s a great question. The first time she asked, my mom was standing 5 ft away from me and she had every opportunity to talk with her about it yet never did", "No we\u2019ve never spoken about the issue. I\u2019ve seen her once in person since then but never reached out. After my mom passed it really split the family and my dads side doesn\u2019t speak to my moms side", "I agree I was definitely rude to my cousin and could have handled things differently. However I was the one living with my mom for the 2 years before she passed, I was her sole care provider with help every once in a while. My cousin never came to help me administer her medications breathing apparatus clean or help her eat etc. I felt it was incredibly disrespectful to not even be there to help out but then immediately want her possessions not even a full day after her passing", "Definitely NTA. And it's not just stuff. It's the principle. Your mother wasn't even dead before you had to deal with the first vulture wanting to pick through her things. She should have been trying to comfort you and your mother but she was clearly too selfish.", "That was unacceptable of her. NTA", "Honestly, I think it really depends on if you feel like salvaging the relationship. I'm not really close with my cousins and I'm okay with it. I guess maybe if she wasn't blocked...there's a possibility she would have tried to apologize? But who knows...", "I\u2019m a knitter and when we lost someone in our community several people got together and distributed the half finished projects so they could be completed. They agreed in advance if each item would stay with that person as a memorial, or be returned to the family.\n\nSo you\u2019re right, it\u2019s not just stuff and cousin is way out of line", "She was in the middle of several projects that she was doing for charity in conjunction with her church groups. All of her unfinished projects were distributed to the mothers and women in her ward and everyone finished them and sent them off, so it wasn\u2019t like her crochet things were just going to be thrown out. It was just such a messy situation for everyone involved", "NTA. Before mom's stroke, my aunt gave her a box of old family photos. When she was in a coma, auntie asked, when I was cleaning out the house she asked, after her funeral she asked. It was horrible. She walked into the church before mom's funeral and wiped off mom's lipstick. \n\nShe and mom had split up grandma's stuff and she felt that she was more entitled to some things than I was and kept trying to take them \n\nThere were a lot of other horrible things and people", "NTA Your family is mad at the wrong person. It should be your cousin they should be mad at. The audacity of asking you BEFORE your mother's death AND WITHIN earshot of her! Of course you told her off. I would have done exactly the same thing as you. My condolences on your loss. May peace and love be with you.", "NTA. Your cousin sounds like my aunt, who only cares about what she will get from her mom (my grandma) when she passes.\n\nIf your family doesn't know what happened before you blocked her, maybe fill them in if you're comfortable with it. If they do know, then they need to realize how rude she was being and that you aren't to blame.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry for your loss. There is a time and place for things. This was neither.", "Was there any emotional attachment that your cousin had to your mom's crochet stuff? I.e. your mom had taught her how to crochet and they'd spent hours together doing the hobby? Otherwise it just seems like she was in it for the stuff.", "You should've told your cousin she wanted to be buried with it.", "That\u2019s the right choice. Definitely messy, but nothing you did was AH behavior."]}
