I've always preferred driving with my cruise control because it helps me maintain a speed that usually won't attract police attention, and I avoid tickets. When I had my first \"adaptive cruise\" vehicle it was a game changer. Basically, if I set my cruise to 65 and someone gets in front of me going slower the vehicle slows itself down.

You're not capable of driving and just too lazy to so saying things like \"but you drive so much better\", etc.  You are, medically, not driving as it could be a danger to yourself and/or others.  \n\nyou're NTA in this situation. Your husband is an @$$", "it's great that words like \"gaslight\" and \"weaponized incompetence\" have entered our cultural vocabulary and we have words to describe abusive behavior or poor communication but the downside is that assholes have access to the same vocabulary and will COMPLETELY misuse it. you're not using weaponized incompetence to make people drive you. you can't safely drive. nta.", "Honestly, your husband's attitude is disgusting, and it would be a deal-breaker for me. He would rather you break the law and risk your life (and the lives of others) than be considerate to your disability. Do you really want to be with someone so ableist, cruel, and disrespectful? I certainly wouldn't. \n\nI also can't drive due to disability and a severe phobia (unrelated to my disability, though it certainly doesn't help). My fianc\u00e9 is accepting and understanding of that. He's comforted me when I was upset about it or when someone wasn't respectful of it, and we've even joked about him being my personal chauffeur.\n\nIt's about respect, which your husband clearly doesn't have for you or your condition. NTA.", "I have nothing against you but I won't be a passenger in your car. I'll rather drive you around whenever I can.", "NTA my dad had MS so i know how the big fear is not knowing when it can hit. \n\nmy guess is your husband is getting frustrated because of the illness and expressing himself badly but no, you are not in the wrong here and all it will take is one ill times twitch to total the car, your insurance and you. ask if that's what he'd rather happen.", "NTA - I also have MS and my right ankle is very tight with limited (and decreasing) mobility. I can drive short distances, but not if any walking is involved as that makes it much worse. As my right foot is my gas/brake foot, driving has become too difficult and unsafe for me as it's hard to hold/flex my right foot/ankle, exhausting my calf and making it difficult to lift my foot off the pedal. If my legs are tired I could easily struggle to move my foot quickly from the gas to the brake, or vice versa. As a result, my husband now has to drive me to my neuro, physio and doctor's appointments. Is it always convenient? No. Does he sometimes have to wait longer than he'd like for me to be done? Yes. Does he complain? I mean...only about traffic/slow doctors, really - but not about me needing a drive. Why? Because MS fucking sucks and I'd much rather BE ABLE TO WALK, thank you very much, but here we are and I can't and it's bullshit and out of my control and FUCK YOU MS. Sorry. It's frustrating all around and it was much easier for everyone when, you know, I wasn't DISABLED. The moment I said \"I don't really feel safe driving anymore...\" he said he'd drive me places. Period. I don't take advantage - he isn't a taxi service and I don't want to abuse his generosity - but damn OP, your husband needs to understand that is UNSAFE and much like me, I'm sure, you'd much rather be driving your damn self around BUT YOU CAN'T because yeah...fuck MS. \n\nI'm sorry you have MS too - it's bullshit.", "Check into public transport for those with disabilities.  In my area, we have Rapid Response buses that will pick up and transport people with disabilities directly to their destination at a reasonable fee.", "Before my Dad passed away, he had majorly bad MS. And did in fact have an episode that should have made him lose control. He managed to pull over and a police officer helped him.\n\nOP isn't the only one at risk when they're behind the wheel and its wise to use caution.\n\nWeaponized incompetence would definitely be different.", "Right!? Weaponize incompetence is, \"herp a derp, how do I wash a dish?\"\n\nWeaponized incompetence is NOT, \"hey, I have a medical condition that keeps me from driving safely, so I don't drive.\"\n\nI swear on my Mama, abusers get their hands on any sort of term to describe bad behavior and immediately apply it to their victims.\n\nAssholes don't even Google to see if they're using the term correctly. Smh", "This! NTA.", "I feel like it\u2019s the subject of quite few posts here.", "She is literally medically not allowed to drive. You have described the exact opposite of the situation.", "Do you know how expensive modifications like this are?  Not to mention that MS could progress and get worse, then the money spent on the modifications would have been a total waste!", "The cost of those cars is astronomical, or so I have been led to believe. I can't ask the person who explained it to me since she's been dead for almost 20 years.", "Speaking as someone with MS, can you describe your twitches? I've experienced muscle spasms and twitching related to my MS, but have never experienced something like you're describing. They're very annoying, and can be painful, but I've never seen anyone with a twitch so strong that it causes them to uncontrollably slam their foot on the accelerator.", "Speaking as someone with MS, what you're describing sounds a lot more like ALS, where the body becomes progressively less controllable, and can become paralyzed. Even with Primary Progressive or Secondary Progressive MS, there's no guarantee that an issue with her legs will ever extend to her arms. It all depends on where the lesions in her brain are. \n\nAdditionally, there is absolutely no guarantee that something like a twitch will ever turn into something like numbness, or loss of use. \n\nFinally, symptoms don't just jump at any time. I have MS, and symptoms don't just suddenly start. It isn't like a nosebleed, where it appears out of the blue. During a flare-up, symptoms come on very, very gradually, before going away just as gradually. You don't wake up one morning to a completely numb leg, you'll wake up with a slight numbness in your toes. The next day, it's slightly worse. The day after, it's worse again. That goes on for a week or so, and then it starts to fade, the exact same way. It goes little by little. There would never be a time where the OP was driving and suddenly lost all use of her arms or legs. If that's happening, it's unrelated to the MS, and there's another, underlying problem.", "the problem with MS is it affects people differently. my dad had it and his issue was his autonomic systems could suddenly spike-heart racing, temperature off the scale and then normal-the most horrid part was not knowing when it would hit.", "NTA and that\u2019s not even what weaponized incompetence is wtf he sounds mean", "Bro wait to bury the lede in the body of the post and only add at the very end YOU ARE LEGALLY EXEMPT and DO NOT HAVE A LICENSE.

NTA but Jesus Christ", "NTA\n\nWhen my cousin got MS, she and her husband ended up getting into therapy. He had never been sick, ever, and he wasn't dealing well with her symptoms. It did help him understand a bit better. \n\nThing is, it's not \"using your condition\". You're medically exempt. You cannot legally drive, and if you got into an accident, it could cause so many legal and insurance issues. You're actually being very responsible in not driving. I hope you can resolve this with your husband.", "My husband also has MS and problems with controlling his legs.  So he took lessons for driving with hand controls and it has made a huge difference in his life.", "NTA. Have you looked into adaptive controls? You could get throttle and brake set up as hand controls or other options. You can work with someone to see what your capabilities are and then have the vehicle controls adapted to suit you.\n\nThen you could drive away from the A H husband.", "Important information on the edit. If you are not allowed to have a license, then your doctors (and the state, province, locale) agree that you should not be driving. You are definitely NTA. Your husband definitely is if he expects you to drive \"just a few blocks\". He sounds overwhelmed.

There are options.", "NTA.\n\n\"Weaponized incompetence\" only applies when you're actually capable of doing the task and purposefully do a bad job at it to get out of the task.\n\nYou, on the other hand, are not allowed to have a driver's license, which means you're doing everyone a favor by not getting on the road.", "NTA at all\n\nI just want to point out that your husband accusing you of weaponized incompetence is accusing you of *faking the severity of your disability*.  He's implying you could drive safely and are pretending to not be able to.\n\nYou should be horribly offended by his accusation, not questioning if you're an AH for existing.", "He does, and I would caution OP to make sure she has money where she can access it in case he leaves her.", "Simple. He'll leave. 21% of men leave their seriously ill spouses compared to 3% of women. I hope OP prepares in case this happens.", "In my province you have to be four years seizure free before you can get a license back. It\u2019s not something taken lightly!", "The ones I knew and what they told me was MS and it progessed to their arms eventually. One much sooner. Also I was a CNA and there was a lady there with MS and hers as well progressed to her arms. The nurses during training told us that it eventually happens to any MS patient. The resident that had it came in to the nursing home walking and slowly progressed. So the information came from medical staff and those whom I knew that had it. They didn\u2019t die from MS but we\u2019re receiving full cares including feeding and drinking. Obviously they could swallow but couldn\u2019t feed themselves.

Only thing incompetent here is his logic.  \n\n\nYou're NTA.", "That\u2019s cost-benefit analysis, not weaponized incompetence.\n\nCost benefit: \u201cthe benefit would be I could go places and my husband wouldn\u2019t be annoyed, but the cost is the emotional impact since im scared, and the real risk that I could seriously injure myself, and others, and have a great financial impact from crashing a car, and the trauma from the crash\u201d.", "Ynta. See if your municipality or public health / social services has reduced rate taxi service for medical appointments. You shouldn\u2019t be driving. Your husband is an asshole.

I am fairly severely disabled but can still drive safely.  It leaves me sore, in spasm and exhausted, so my husband does all the driving now, except for rare very short drives to get something to eat late at night, which I only do because a) very short and rare and b) he\u2019s positively a menace when he\u2019s deeply tired - he shouldn\u2019t be behind the wheel because he\u2019s so incapacitated, and getting him up at 2 AM because I\u2019m hungry is not worth the risk.", "As a woman who became disabled in my early 20s, I put off marrying my husband for several years because I\u2019d watched so many marriages break up among the disabled women I knew.  The first decade of me being sick, I was pretty consistently getting worse every 16-20 months, and I was always afraid he\u2019d hit the point where he went \u201cthis is too much.\u201d  We were together just over 10 years before we finally married (though the last 2 years was more about having enough money saved for the wedding to not acquire and debt to pay for it).", "I\u2019m really happy it worked out for you! I hope it works out for OP too, but I think precautions are probably a good idea here.", "OP specifically said that her twitch was bad enough that she would not be able to stop the car, so I\u2019m quite disinclined to disbelieve her about how dangerous it would be for her to drive an unmodified car.  They don\u2019t hit you with a medical bar to driving over small things; people often drive in extraordinarily dangerous condition before their doctors do that.\n\nIf driving an unmodified car was safe for her, they would have given her a restricted license (which you\u2019re only allowed to use with an appropriately modified car, in much the same way that people with a certain degree of vision problems are only allowed to drive with corrective lenses).

At this point, I\u2018m not employed and he does all the housework, because he\u2019d rather I spent all of my \u201cgood\u201d time with him or doing things I enjoy, and most housework causes pain and risks minor injury (my hands, wrists, and shoulders are the most severely affected parts of my body, which you kinda need functional for pretty much all housework, unless you can use a different body part in a way that places unusual strain, and all of my joints are fragile and/or damaged).
