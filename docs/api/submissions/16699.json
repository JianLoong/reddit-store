Your husband should be more understanding of your situation and find alternative ways to help you get around without making you feel guilty or ashamed. It's also important to take care of your mental health and not let your fear of driving prevent you from living your life. You have the right to seek transportation that makes you feel comfortable and safe, even if it means spending more money on Ubers or requesting remote appointments.", "You aren't even allowed to have a license?

Or using a scooter (50cc or 125cc) since they too are all hand controled. So two options to regain your independence.", "NAH . You have an uncontrollable leg reflex that may make you a danger to yourself and others on the road. Is it brake, accelerator or clutch that would be affected? It may be worth if this is a major issue seeing if you can find a modified car so controlled by hands not feet? But get assessed because weaponised incompetence is a choice people make and I think you have a genuine reason to worry.\n\nThat said, I get your husband's frustrations. I am driver in family and it does get frustrating. Especially when in my case, it was his choice not to. A lot falls on driver and it makes it harder to share tasks as anything out of house falls on driver or you both at same time. But you have a chronic condition and sometimes people have to accept that makes things uneasy.\n\nPerhaps take him to next medical so authority figure can explain lack of muscle control.

Look into for yourself to not be dependent upon others perhaps. Now if you have motility problems in the arms then I would say no to that but see if it could be an option.

NAH, you're certainly not an AH for not feeling safe driving, but it's also not fair to force your husband to be your chauffeur.  And indeed, there are hands-only driving controls for people with problems exactly like this, or you can Uber or other public transportation - your husband is not an AH for not wanting to have to drive you everywhere you go either, this would be a big demand on his time and energy, and for a lot of people driving is work, not fun.  You should look into having your car outfitted with hand controls.", "Came here to suggest the accelerator/brake paddles for your hands! OP this would be a huge help for you both."]}
