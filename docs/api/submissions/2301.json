Legally yours in every wsy with conversation to back it up. No legal grounds at all on his part. This is what we call sour grapes. He got rid of something he thought was junk. It was not junk as you luckily found out. You profited. As many ppl do with antiqued etc. You were the lucky one.

And I don't think I'd want someone like that as a friend in future. \n\nHe's mad because he didn't think they were worth real money, and he sold them for less than they were worth. I would just explain to anyone that asks that you bought them at the price he asked for them years ago and now he's lying about loaning them to you because he wants  a cut of the profits. That's not how selling things works. He sold and they are 100% yours, he has zero claim to what you did with them after that. He can't come back years later and do a take-sy back-sy.", "NTA.

Are you that greedy?\" hahahahahahaaa NTA", "NTA heck no don\u2019t give him a dime. You should tell ppl first the audacity of him.

Hes getting nothing and reading responses here I'm glad everyone agrees I'm in the right to tell him to flip off", "NTA- And if he does go to small claims court and states OP was just storing it for him then OP should create pricing based off the cost of a storage unit. If it\u2019s a piece of furniture that is large and can\u2019t be disassembled then it would most likely need a 5x10 storage unit to fit the whole set with chairs. In my area, that costs about $60-100 a month. He potentially now owes OP $2,100- $4,500. He should bring the emails as well as the pricing for storage units in the area so he gets reimbursed the cost of taking care of it for five years in a temperature controlled home.", "Very good point. Lesson learnt and so glad everyone has confirmed I'm in the right. I took screenshot of our messages. They were facebook DMs, not email, I worded slightly wrong in post. But point still stands that I have written backup confirming it was a transaction and he sold to me. Case closed and I can move on feelin better now", "100% agree. One lesson I've learnt from this is dont mention money on social media. It opens up the door for vultures like this. I'm glad I'm NTA tho.

Solid, good quality wood that was expensive.  Stupidly, I neglected the set for years, and the wood faded and warped. Ended up giving the set away for free (I didn't want to go through the hassle of restoring or selling it).  The person I gave it to ended up restoring the set (it was beautiful), and said she planned to sell it. I had a moment of regret (\"damn, I could have paid someone to restore it and either kept it, or sold it for more than the restoration would have cost\"), but that was on me, not her.  I gave the set to her, and it was hers to do with as she pleased.  I texted her back that she did an awesome job and I am sure that whoever buys it will be very happy with it.  Moral of the story, once you give away/sell your stuff, it is no longer yours.", "NTA. If money is so important to him then maybe his friends should know exactly the type of person he is.
