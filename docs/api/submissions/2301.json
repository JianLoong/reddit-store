I had a look at them, seemed OK - a bit old and used, so I offered \u00a350 for the lot.\n\nHe said something like \"I was actually going to throw them out.LOL. You've saved me the hassle!\". I did think \"Shouldnt have said \u00a350!!\" - but I thought a deals a deal so paid \u00a350. I organised man with a van to collect and deliver then emailed him to say thanks for helping get everything into the van, happy with purchase, and saved me paying for first hand dining set. He replied saying no probs, glad they've got a new home. End of story.\n\nFast forward 5 years and I'm moving house myself. New place too small for huge table & chairs so need to sell. I find info on underside of table. Take lots of pics and email loads of places nearby asking for price to purchase. Within an hour I get 3 replies. They all want to inspect furniture and assess. By end of the week I get 3 offers and highest is \u00a31500!!! Apparently once restored theyll be worth a lot more. Jackpot!\n\nI post saying house move goin to plan etc then add in the great news that I scored \u00a31500 jackpot selling my old table and chairs.\n\nLater that night my mate messages me in a RAGE!! First half is just abuse, but second half reads \"I'm demanding half the money from the sale of my table and chairs. I only gave them to you to look after. I didnt sell them to you. I'm happy to agree to half since you've had them in storage in your house. If you've been using them fair enough. But I'm not happy you're selling them because I didnt agree to that. My bank details are ******. Transfer me \u00a3750 by the end of the week and I'll call it quits. If money isn't received I'm going to small claims court and also police to report that you're selling my property\"\n\nI reply \"I literally bought these from you? Are you insane??I even have an email where I thanked you helping to get the furniture into the van. I also say you saved me money buying a dining set first hand!\"\n\nHe replies \"So this is how you thank me 5 years later? Making huge profit from a mate? If I'd known how much it was worth do you seriously think I'd have sold to you for \u00a350? You're 2 faced. I'm goin to go to small claims court\"\n\nI reply \"You just said you sold to me for \u00a350!!!LOL. That's my point. You literally SOLD to me. I didnt know they were worth that much when I bought them. The fact is I bought it from you fair and square. End of discussion\"\n\nThe last reply I have is \"At the very least I want my fair share.

He SOLD you something for \u00a350 that you literally sat on for 5 years, then flipped for \u00a31500 makes him for a fool and TA. Firstly, he sold it to you. You gave him money for an item.

Now he realizes he was a fool and he wants his cut? Oh. Hell. No. If you were simply storing it for him, where\u2019s your monthly rent money? Storage units cost money. CALL HIS BLUFF.

I think you should give him the $500 he most recently mentioned.

Make sure you've got a paper trail of him saying that he sold it to you though, in case he's psycho enough to actually take you to court.", "NTA. Money really brings out the worst in people.
