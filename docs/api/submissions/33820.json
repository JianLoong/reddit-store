{"id": 33820, "submission_id": "18rnund", "title": "AITA for refusing to drive my husband to the airport and being upset he is leaving?", "selftext": "Some background, we live on the east coast and his family lives in TX. My family lives about 4 hours away. They drive to us for every holiday, birthday, dance recital, etc. We have lived here for roughly 7 years (before that, we lived in TX). His family takes several trips/vacations a year and only once, this past year, came to visit us. Over the 7 years we have went to visit them at minimum 1-3 times per year. My husband works out of town about 3 weeks a month so it\u2019s a lot of solo parenting for me. \n\nThe weekend before xmas he went with his parents and siblings to OK to visit his grandparents. Myself and my children were unable to go as my daughter  had holiday things going on at home she didn\u2019t want to miss. He came home the Monday before xmas and asked if we could swing a trip to TX after xmas to see his family and so his dad and him could go to the Alamo bowl. I told him that we unfortunately couldn\u2019t. We really couldn\u2019t swing an unplanned trip financially right now and with wanting to travel so close to the holidays booking prices were extremely high. I also explained to him that our daughter had off of school and all sports this week and that NEVER happens, especially when he is home too, and I really wanted this to be a week for us to all spend together. Especially since he will start traveling for work again on the 2nd of January and will not be home until the last week of January. \n\nThe day before Christmas Eve I was out shopping and he texted me saying he knew I was going to be mad but his dad had booked him a flight and bought tickets for himself, my husband, my BIL and MIL to all go to the game. He would return the 30th. I got upset because we had already talked about going and I said that we just couldn\u2019t swing it this year. His response was that he \u201cknew nothing about this and his dad surprised him with it for a last minute Xmas gift\u201d (which is a lie because they mailed our gifts to us and our children and he had received a Xmas gift). I asked him if everything had already been purchased as I would like him to not go. He said yes, and that he was going because it\u2019s something he really wanted to do. We haven\u2019t spoken much since then honestly because I feel very hurt that he doesn\u2019t want to spend time with myself and our children before a long work trip, after he\u2019s just seen his family last week, and would rather spend most of the week with his parents. He says that we could just book flights for myself and our kids to go but we honestly don\u2019t have the money and I\u2019m not maxing out a credit card for an unplanned trip. \n\nTonight he asked me if I will be driving him to the airport tomorrow morning for a 6 am flight. I told him that he will need to book an Uber because I\u2019m not waking our kids up at 3:30 am to drive an hour each way to the airport so that he can go on a trip that I don\u2019t even want him going on. He says that I\u2019m being unreasonable.

He literally sees you for 1/4 of the year, and that Quarter you are begging for him to actually be present and not visiting his family or doing whatever HE wants. When do YOU get a break? When do YOU get to just f it and fly to your parents and expect the other one to just pick up the pieces? This doesn\u2019t sound sustainable, you sound like a maid that he occasionally has a child with.", "Nta. If he would rather spend more time with his family then the family that he created then throw his stuff on the porch mail divorce papers to him while he is at his parents at peace the fuck out.", "NTA.  It's clear that his parents/grandparents/siblings take precedence over you and your children.  And his job.  You are way down on his list.  I would recommend couples counseling but even if his work didn't take him out of town for such long periods of time, I'm guessing he wouldn't go?  Time for some hard discussions and decisions on if this marriage is even worth being in.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry that you are going through this. He really has checked out as a husband and father.", "NTA kinda sounds like all his work trips have made him forget that he has a responsibility to his kids first and foremost. He just wants the bachelor life while you keep the home and do the child rearing and then he gets to pop in at his leisure.", "Do not drive him to the airport. I don\u2019t think you will even want to talk to him except to let him know that while he is gone you will be seriously considering whether your marriage is worth the sacrifices you make. Emphasize sacrifices. Do not make excuses for him to your children. Daughter is old enough to recognize selfishness. Don\u2019t let this be an example to them unless it\u2019s billed as a bad example. Do not communicate with him while he is gone. Or FIL. If you don\u2019t have a job get one. Do wonderful things over the holidays even if you must use a credit card.", "NTA- He doesn\u2019t even know your financial situation. He\u2019s all about leaving you and the kids for fun filled times paid for by his family. Cause he really wants to do this.  Re-evaluate.  And what\u2019s with his family anyway?", "HOLY COW NTA! he\u2019s not only a crappy husband and absentee father and your in-laws are funding his much needed vacation (insert eyeroll) before leaving his family for work. So you absolutely are NTA for not driving your husband to the airport, make sure not to pick him up either.", "NTA - He sounds like my ex. EX being the important part of that. If he is traveling so much for work and just visited his family, this is a pretty loud message that he doesn't want to spend quiet family time at hone.", "NTA\n\nEven if there wasn\u2019t the additional conflict here, expecting you and the kids to get up at 3:30am to give him a ride for his flight is ridiculous.\n\nEverything else makes him (and frankly, his father) the asshole.\n\nBecause his father absolutely should be able to recognize how important it is to be present for your own kids during the holiday, especially if you\u2019re gone most of the other time for work.", "Take the kids and go visit your parents the night before he comes home and stay a few days  if you can. Tell him it's something you really wanted to do and your mom surprised you with gas money. You just can't turn her down, she really wants to spend time with the family", "Why are you married to this person? Do you even have a relationship? Does he have any sort of positive relationship with his children? It sounds like he is either traveling for work or visiting his family and that cannot possibly be healthy for anyone. \n\nAdd to that, he does not appear to care about anyone in the family aside from himself and that is certainly not helpful in creating a healthy family dynamic. And he's selfish. \n\nNTA, in this immediate issue, but I feel like you may be because you are sticking with this guy and not providing yourself and your children a healthy homelife.", "NTA. Your husband is possibly one of the most self-centered and inconsiderate people I've read about in a while. Wake your kids up? No.", "So, his wants outweigh his family's needs and he thinks *you're* being unreasonable? I mean, I like football myself but I'd crawl over flaming shattered glass to be with my family on holidays, especially if I had a long work trip coming up. \n\nNTA, obviously. Does he even want to be married? Because this is a good way to end up not married.", "NTA and I hope you will show this thread to your husband that many people agree that this isn't normal behavior for families that are doing well together. I don't think I would be happy with a \"couple day a month\" husband and I'm sure your kids would like to have a dad who was around.", "That is ridiculous! Leave him! You never see him anyway and this obviously doesn\u2019t bother him. Have divorce papers drawn up and sent to him and change all the locks while he\u2019s gone. I\u2019m so mad on your and your children\u2019s behalf!", "NTA. Sounds like there's a second family. Either yours or another in TX. And I'm not talking about his parents, etc.", "Issues like this are why I'm glad to live within 45 minutes of most of our family, but still only see them a few times a year.", "NTA, of course. I would be tempted to ask the in-laws why they think its okay to take your husband away from his kids and wife during Christmas, especially since they had just seen him the week before. What is wrong with these people?", "He's selfish. Think about your relationship, including all the solo parenting due to his work related travel. He has now gone on two trips ina one month to be with his family.\n\nYou're his wife. You and your children are supposed to be his priority as you're his nuclear family.\n\nWhen does he do any parenting?\n\nWhen do you travel solo, leaving him with the kids?\n\nMight be time to decide whether you want to make it official and parent alone.", "Nta. You might as well file for divorce as you\u2019re already separated.", "NTA. You are already a single mother, why not make it official with the courts? He wants to live his bachelor lifestyle while you take care of the kids and home, let him. You\u2019ll find someone who will treat you a million times better than what you\u2019re getting now!", "NTA. It's bad enough that he's deserting his wife and children but let's add insult to injury...let's expect you and the kids to wake up at 3am to take me to the airport and be on the road for an hour so I can go have fun with the people who are really important to me.\nHe is one selfish a$$hole. Tell him dad should have booked him uber rides when he booked the plane ticket.", "Holy crap, why did he ever get married/have kids? It sure doesn\u2019t seem like he wants to spend time with his wife and children. (Asking you to drive him to the airport was the cherry on top \ud83d\ude44). Seems like he prefers the single lifestyle with few responsibilities. I don\u2019t know how you can stand to be married to him. I am so sorry. What a Christmas present for you and the kids\u2026\ud83d\ude14", "NTA", "Update me", "NTA, and I would tell him to stay there and not come back since he doesn't care and doesn't want to be with you and your child. He seems heartless and cold. Makes me wonder why everyone else is more important than you and your children. I seriously would tell him not to come back and that you need space and a separation. Harsh, yes, needed, IMO, yes, because he isn't even being a part-time dad or husband.", "NTA. \n\nYou know he asked his dad to buy the ticket.  That is just disrespectful.", "Tell him his mistress can take him...he spends an awful amount of time away from home for work to financially support the family, yet drops everything to get away from you all when he should be wanting to stay home with the family especially at Christmas, I wonder what's really going on.\nYNTA", "NTA, that would be your husband that doesn't prioritize you or your children over his parents.     You need to decide if him being an ass is a deal breaker especially since he doesn't show the same enthusiasm for being with his children that he does his parents.  \n\nYou both need therapy because you sound like his doormat where he does what he wants and doesn't care how it gets paid for where his family in Texas is concerned.  You do the heavy lifting and mental load with the children you share.  \n\nAs for being unreasonable, you aren't being unreasonable your spouse is being a PITA to the extreme.", "NTA. Change the locks while he\u2019s gone.", "He doesn\u2019t sound like he actually likes you very much if he doesn\u2019t look forward to spending time with you and the kids. Does he do this in other ways?", "NTA, but please ask yourself: would you miss him that much if you divorced? He's hardly ever home and when he is he doesn't prioritize you and your kids. Custodial time might mean he sees them more then he does now.", "Nta. I would divorce him. Your kids deserve better.", "NTA...quite honestly you are being nicer than most people would be.\n\nClearly you and your feelings don't mean shit to your husband nor his family.", "NTA what a load! I\u2019m so sorry OP the blatant disrespect to you and your children is so wild.", "Imagine throwing away your marriage to watch OU choke in a mediocre bowl game.\n\nNTA.", ">My husband works out of town about 3 weeks a month\n\nINFO: how long has he has this 3/1 week schedule? How far out of town?\n\nNTA for not driving him. That part isn't even about the messiness of this trip. It's incomprehensible why a parent would want their family to wake up so early to drive them an hour to the airport. Then, you'd be driving another hour alone with a sleepy/cranky 10 year old & 1 year old.", "Are the kids from his secret family the same ages as yours? You should try to arrange playdates after you move closer to your family. Does the secret family live closer to his parents, and are they keeping his secret?", "NTA. Tell him his dad can pay for the Uber, too.", "NTA\n\nAnything else I could say would be removed by the mods", "NTA. Honey. Do not take him, don't pick him up. You two need to reevaluate his and your position. Nobody deserves to be treated like a doormat. I'm sorry to be blunt, but him telling you to get the kids up at 3:30 so daddy can go play in TX is bs. It's insulting. He's dumping his own children to go party in TX? And grandkids weren't invited? Are you positive he's going to be with family? I sure would need photos.", "NTA. He works that much away from home and still doesn\u2019t make enough for you to be comfortable paying for a trip like this? Why is it worth it, then? Because he has no parental responsibilities? Think about it\u2026", "NTA you need to check his email and social media accounts immediately. He has a second secret family or a gf. His story just isn\u2019t right.", "NTA but girl what are you doing?  Your a married single parent. Do you get anything out of this relationship anymore?  It seems you do everything and your husband just does whatever the hell he wants.  He doesn\u2019t care (or doesn\u2019t care enough) about you and your family. Don\u2019t tolerate his disrespect.", "NTA.  At this point, will anything really be different if you were a single parent? He's home one week a month and now that your kids are home for Christmas break, he wants to be gone again for a football game that is a 1 day event. Other than contributing financially, what else is he bringing to the table? When does he make you and your kids a priority? Has he asked for or planned time for just the two of you? Has he ever acknowledged that you do the majority of the parenting, running of the household, upkeep on the house and yard, bill paying, appointments, etc and thanked you for it or expressed any appreciation? I'm not saying you should make the leap to divorce him but highlighting the fact that he is absent for so much. \n\nFrom the brief glimpse of your married life you've given us, some of these questions may not be fair of me to ask. However, it sounds as if you are extremely frustrated and hurt and that his selfishness is a reoccurring issue. And the fact that his family is willing to buy HIM a plane ticket for a visit but not you and the kids comes off as rude and hurtful. I'm willing to bet that after the first conversation about the football game, he threw you under the bus and said you weren't going to let him go. \n\nIf you can and want to, spend some time with your family. Or, it sounds like life is busy with sports and activities, so maybe you and the kids would love some pajama days where everyone can relax and watch movies and just chill. However you choose to spend the time your husband is away, please give thought and consideration to what works and doesn't work in your marriage; what you can compromise on and what you can't; what you absolutely NEED from him going forward. \n\nHe needs to understand this isn't about a football game or a trip to see his family. It's about him prioritizing his wants and the desires and whims of his parents over his wife and child. It's about him literally choosing to NOT spend time with his wife and kids and having Daddy buy him a plane ticket to do it. It's about his inability to deny himself something he wants for the good of his wife and kids.", "NTA. \n\nSo, to clarify, this is probably the only week of the whole year where other obligations wouldn't interfere with complete family time... and he is leaving? \n\nPlease evaluate how he supports and loves your family in ways outside of finances. If that list is not extensive, you may want to rethink what type of relationship you have. Being a single mom only gets easier when you are actually single instead of married. \n\nMy husband is military, and until the last 2 years was gone regularly for long periods of time. When he came home, his only priority was spending as much time as possible with us as a family and each of us individually.\n\nPeople who love their families would never voluntarily choose to spend more time away from them when obligations already keep them separated regularly.", "nta, he planned the trip so he can plan his ride to and from the airport", "NTA", "NTA\n\nThere is no easy way to say this, but your husband is a major AH. You are already effectively a single mother as it is. maybe it is time to formalise that.\n\nTell him if he goes, not to bother coming back.\n\nLawyer up and get rid of him. Boot him out.\n\nhe can't be bothered to spend time with his family when he is not working away", "NTA. If he's OK w you maxing out a card, go somewhere with the kids. He made his choice.", "Have you considered when he comes back, to just be gone? Take the kids to visit your parents. They can miss school for a week. Let him sit by himself.", "INFO: does your husband like you?", "NTA. Your husband isn't putting you or your children first. \n\nIt's time to sit him down and talk to him about priorities.", "NTA.....oh boy reading this made me so mad. Your husband is being so unbelievably selfish ..... I just can't even. This is a man that's not a part of your family.", "Honestly I\u2019d tell him to go and have fun. But also make sure to pack everything he owns to take with him since he has made his choice. I\u2019m sure you love him but what do you actually need him for? He has no issue leaving you to do everything so make it easier for him and continue to do just that.", "You\u2019re unreasonable!!! He\u2019s an AH! Talk about taking his family for granted, I feel like he\u2019s saying \u201cahhh they\u2019ll always be there\u201d I\u2019m going. I really hope you made him take an Uber!!", "NTA - I was so ready to lay into you but your husband is being ridiculous. When does he even see you guys? I know spending time with his parents is important, but he\u2019s got to prioritize you and the kids\u2026 at least sometimes! Wow.", "You are NTA.  You are married to a spoiled, selfish brat who is completely taking you and your daughter for granted.  If he were my husband, he would come home to divorce papers, changed locks, and all his stuff packed up.  Please consider the example your relationship is setting for your daughter.  Do.not.pick.him.up.from.the.airport.", "There's a problem in your story. \n\nHaving already received Christmas gifts in the mail does not mean it is necessarily a lie that someone received another gift. \n\nYTA. If you're going to make up stuff to be mad at, YTA.", "NTA.. I wouldn\u2019t even want to be there when he gets back. Better yet, tell him to go ahead & stay there & mail him his Christmas gift.. divorce papers. What\u2019s the point of prolonging what seems inevitable? He doesn\u2019t want to be there & you deserve to be able to sort yourself & move on with your life in grace & dignity, not counting on your jerk of a husband to disappoint you & your kids any further. He already one foot out of the door.. help him all the way out. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s just my trauma, but I\u2019m inclined to believe it\u2019s not just work, & only his parents he keeps leaving you for. Sounds like the man has a double life & you & your kids are not the main one.", "NTA\n\nI hate to break it to you, but you don't have a husband. You have a long distance financial sponsor who isn't interested in prioritizing your immediate family.", "NTA. Your husband\u2019s behaviour is grounds for divorce. Serious question if you did actually divorce your husband would his role and his participation change all that much in the family? If The answer is no, you have a lot to think about.", "NTA\n\nYour husband is the ahole. I also think your he is likely making a lot of other bad decisions behind your back.", "YTA.  You and your daughter could have gone on the trip as well and enjoyed the holiday with his family as well as attending a big-time football game.  Then refusing to drive him to the airport is just petty.  Perhaps it wasn't your dream for the time, but it was one that could easily have worked well.  \n\nMakes me wonder if the decision to have a job that requires so much out of town travel is intentional.", "NTA - He's being a terribly bad husband and father, but he wants *you* to go out of *your way* to help him do it?  What an ass.  \n\nHe's skipping out on his family in exchange for what, a game?  Why are your in-laws  encouraging him to do this? \n\nSeriously, I wouldn't want him back after this.  He's showing you who he is and you should believe him. Then get a great lawyer.", "NTA\n\nSweetie, you do not have a husband. You have a sperm donor mostly absent roommate who pays rent.  He clearly wants nothing to do with you or the kids right now. \n\nYou need to take the time while he is away to decide if there is enough of your relationship that exists that you want to try to fight to make things better or if you just need to cut your losses and move on without him. \n\nYou are already doing it all without him and when you try to ask him for help, he runs to mommy and daddy.", "He is away for work for extreme amounts of time and wants to spend all his free time with his extended family and not you and the kids and you are being unreasonable?

And that you will just accept it and forgive him. If I was you I would take a good hard look at how many times he has done things like this and if it\u2019s a lot, do u want to put up with this for the rest of your life. You are basically a married single parent. Three weeks out of a month he is away for work and his free time isn\u2019t spent with you and the kids, sounds like he doesn\u2019t care.", "What is he bringing to this relationship that wouldn't have the exact same result if he were to just pay child support?", "I hope every decision you make regarding your husband and his family from here on out keeps one fact very clear and in the forefront of your mind:\n\nIt's not that he doesn't understand. He just *does not care*.

He won't.", "NTA. Sounds like he is selfish and maybe cheating.", "NTA. He is for asking you to drive at that ungodly hour alone (never mind the fact that he doesn't want to spend any time with the family he created). Is he too good for airport parking?

And if I were you, when he got back he could pick his things up from the front lawn on his way to his new place.", "NTA even if you had no problem with the trip, driving him to the airport is a completely unreasonable request.

He\u2019s doing it on the only week he can possibly spend with his (actual) family that he made for a whole month.\n\n5.

He gets around the financial part by obviously telling his family who then pay for the plane ticket.\n\nHis family isn't supporting you. They have undermined you. Your husband is selfish and will do whatever he wants.\n\nYou're already a single mom. You're NTA.

My family lives about 4 hours away. They drive to us for every holiday, birthday, dance recital, etc. We have lived here for roughly 7 years (before that, we lived in TX). His family takes several trips/vacations a year and only once, this past year, came to visit us. Over the 7 years we have went to visit them at minimum 1-3 times per year. My husband works out of town about 3 weeks a month so it\u2019s a lot of solo parenting for me. \n\nThe weekend before xmas he went with his parents and siblings to OK to visit his grandparents. Myself and my children were unable to go as my daughter  had holiday things going on at home she didn\u2019t want to miss. He came home the Monday before xmas and asked if we could swing a trip to TX after xmas to see his family and so his dad and him could go to the Alamo bowl. I told him that we unfortunately couldn\u2019t. We really couldn\u2019t swing an unplanned trip financially right now and with wanting to travel so close to the holidays booking prices were extremely high. I also explained to him that our daughter had off of school and all sports this week and that NEVER happens, especially when he is home too, and I really wanted this to be a week for us to all spend together. Especially since he will start traveling for work again on the 2nd of January and will not be home until the last week of January. \n\nThe day before Christmas Eve I was out shopping and he texted me saying he knew I was going to be mad but his dad had booked him a flight and bought tickets for himself, my husband, my BIL and MIL to all go to the game. He would return the 30th. I got upset because we had already talked about going and I said that we just couldn\u2019t swing it this year. His response was that he \u201cknew nothing about this and his dad surprised him with it for a last minute Xmas gift\u201d (which is a lie because they mailed our gifts to us and our children and he had received a Xmas gift). I asked him if everything had already been purchased as I would like him to not go. He said yes, and that he was going because it\u2019s something he really wanted to do. We haven\u2019t spoken much since then honestly because I feel very hurt that he doesn\u2019t want to spend time with myself and our children before a long work trip, after he\u2019s just seen his family last week, and would rather spend most of the week with his parents. He says that we could just book flights for myself and our kids to go but we honestly don\u2019t have the money and I\u2019m not maxing out a credit card for an unplanned trip. \n\nTonight he asked me if I will be driving him to the airport tomorrow morning for a 6 am flight. I told him that he will need to book an Uber because I\u2019m not waking our kids up at 3:30 am to drive an hour each way to the airport so that he can go on a trip that I don\u2019t even want him going on. He says that I\u2019m being unreasonable. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

His dad removed the financial argument and the 2-3 hours of the game isn't long if the whole fam is in TX together.\n\nPersonally, when it became clear the family wanted this to be a thing I would have offered a compromise.  We can't afford the flight to keep this to a 1-2 day event so you aren't missing the quality time.

Are his children even comfortable around him? He is acting like he has no responsibility to your family. \n\nI bet he never thinks about how you NEVER get a break.

Clearly your children are young (ie not teens) as you can't leave them sleeping in their beds. Why does he not want to spend the holidays with you and the children during the holidays so you guys can make memories together? Why are his parents more important than his wife and children? Does he realize how selfish he is being or does he not care? These are questions I would be asking him. \n \nThe next time he comes back for a week. You should plan a vacation just for yourself.

How does that constitute traveling to see a football game, which doesn't take place until December 28th?  Plus, he just got back from a trip to Oklahoma with his family.  I don't know why he couldn't have flown out early on the 27th to Texas. Why did he actually have to be gone on Christmas Day? Things just aren't adding up for me. Also, the mere fact that you and your children are so absolutely meaningless to him that he's willing to do this to you, tells you that he just doesn't give a damn about any of you any more. Why waste your time with him? You're letting him get away with absolute murder, and he's going to keep doing it.\n\nIf his parents live in Texas, are they flying him there and then the whole family will drive to the football game? What's the deal? Will he be staying with them the entire time?\n\nAre you absolutely positive he's not cheating on you? Parents have often been known to lie to help cover up their children's infidelity. The absolute gall of this man in being gone so much is such a huge red flag to me. Please look into this carefully, and don't give away the fact that you're suspicious (if you are), but make sure you do everything you can to protect yourself financially and emotionally if you end up having to confront him.

Husband sounds like he words as hard as he does to provide for the family. In this economy, we have to do things that we normally wouldn\u2019t to survive. I agree that OP has every right to be frustrated but if she doesn\u2019t have a job and his is the only income, then she may need to suck that aspect up. It keeps a roof over her and the children\u2019s heads.  \n\nThe Christmas with the in-laws. I get why he wants to see his family, but that is not fair on OP who doesn\u2019t get to have a break. She is entitled to be pissed.\n\nNTA", "I appreciate you doing the math on how much of the very limited time they get with dad is spent visiting his family - who can't be bothered to visit them.\n\nI feel so bad for OP and the kids.", ">Comments are in random ordering and vote scores are hidden", "That may not be completely true.

The first one, they said the girl didn't want to go, so the mom stayed home.  And this one she said they couldn't afford to go as a family.  That doesn't mean he didn't want them there.", "He sounds like a dick and I'm glad you cut him loose. Congrats on your new life!", "\"Without the constant disappointment when he lets you down\" this hurt to read and I'm not the OP.  Imagine how those kids must feel, too.

Cost a total of $1000 including hotel, food costs, festival pass for artists, transportation prior to festival starting etc. (yes we had to stay at a specific hotel if we wanted transportation covered while in the city) Flights were on points so didn't need to pay for that, but even with a few months of planning, I still haven't fully recovered financially from it.

OP, I had a friend with a husband who worked like this.  Turned out he had a whole other family she didn\u2019t know about (partner and kids in both).  He kept it going by claiming he was working FIFO to both.\n\nHe was with his family interstate right before Xmas then suddenly right after?  That says to me he may not have been with them both times.", "NTA. You guys need to sit down and talk about things seriously. \n\nIt\u2019s clear that you are hurt by his actions and he needs to hear that. It seems like if things don\u2019t change the marriage could end. He\u2019s being pretty selfish asking you to take him to the airport and everything. You may need a marriage counselor for him to get it.", "NTA. He's ditching you and the kids over the holidays and has the nerve to expect you to drive him to the airport??\n\nTbh, it sounds like you're already a single parent, OP.

NTA my dear and please don\u2019t pick him up either!", "Are these your kids or his?", "NTA. Even if you wanted him to go, asking you for a ride to the airport is just mind-blowingly stupid. Everyone in the house getting up that early to make the long drive there and back is the height of being inconsiderate. Now add back in the part where you asked him to not go and he STILL wanted a ride. Dude is delusional.", "I\u2019d replace him with a better model, one that\u2019s actually present in your life.

It doesn\u2019t seem like it.", "While he's at the Alamo Bowl, have your own Davy Crockett moment and get your locks changed. Leave his suitcase for his trip outside.  Maybe by February, he will be willing to emotionally contribute to the family and actually parent his children. Because right now he is living the single life with not a care about how you and the kids manage.  \nBTW the Alamo Bowl is a second rate game not worthy of all this drama.", "Clearly, he needs to spend some quality time with his children, and YOU need a break from being a single parent. You could always book tickets for just the kids to go with him, so he can enjoy single parenting while visiting his family, and you can relax at home.\n\nAlternatively, you could go visit your family alone for a few days after he gets back, and relax for a while while HE handles single-parenting duties at home. (Neither of these options is something he has a say in, however, since he doesn't accept your input on when YOU get left with all the work.)\n\nIt's all well and good for him to see his family at Christmas, but when do YOU get a break from parenting? If he's going to dump all the work on you for days or weeks at a time, he needs to be proactive in finding times to give you a break. If he's not doing this, start with baby steps by choosing those times FOR him. He'll learn, or he won't, and either way, you'll know where his priorities lie.\n\nNTA.", "NTA - He's a major asshole.  He's gone all the time and still in single-guy mode.  *? Did he ever act like a husband at all ?*  It seems his only priority is to go back to TX/OK and suckle off his parents.\n\nNext time, tell him not to come back.  He's already gone mentally.", "NTA. Your husband is worthless and not even a husband or father. He\u2019s literally never home, you and your kids see him maybe 3 days a month, and he prioritizes his parents over his own wife and kids every single time.

You\u2019re basically an unmarried single mom already. Divorce him so he can go live with his mommy which he clearly wants to do.", "Honestly NTA even ignoring that he should be acting like a parent. When my kids were too young to be left home alone and my partner had early flights, he took a cab instead of interrupting everyone's sleep.", "NTA. At this point, you need to seriously consider if being in this marriage is more harm than it's worth.", "NTA You have valid reasons for not wanting him to go. He was selfish and said f that, then to pour salt in the wound he had a flight booked at a time that is unreasonable to you and your kids. He didn't think anything through. Talk to your MIL & FIL to confirm what he told you. Maybe explain it to them, because clearly his communication is lacking.", "NTA.\n\nIf you only have 1 car, hide the keys. With how selfish he I'd acting I wouldn't put it past him to drive your only car to the airport and leave it in long term parking and leave you and kiddos stranded all week.", "NTA\n\nLet me get this straight.  Your family can't afford to purchase expensive holiday tickets.  And you get a chance to spend time together which doesn't happen often.  Your AH husband **purchases the tickets and blows off all of you for the entire week?  And lies to you about where the money came from?  And has the gall to want you to wake up early to take his ass to the airport?**\n\nIt's seriously time to consider divorce.  His actions show he doesn't like spending time with any of you more than watching a game with his dad.  And he will lie to you to get what he wants.  And he will blow the family budget to do so.", "Time for you to plan a vacation for yourself.  No warning, no discussion, just I want to go so I am.  Let's see if that helps him to understand your point of view.", "Just tell him to not come back. That you'll hire lawyers to work out the rest. Since his priority isn't your children or your family. It will be for the best. He can go to all the sporting events he wants and his parents want. Seriously all just to go Alamo bowl. Wrong Priorities.", "Of course he wants to be married! He needs a bang-maid to wash and iron his clothes when he comes from his business trips!", "This was what I was thinking but felt reluctant to say. To me, this would be a reason to divorce for he rather goes to a ball game with his parents and brother than spend time with his wife and children, whom he doesn't see that often to begin with. He is extremely selfish and apparently does not miss time with his children much.\n\nBesides that, he lied, for no way this was a 'surprise'. They planned it this way.", "You also missed the part where OP's family makes more of an effort to travel to see OP and her family, whereas, OP's husband's family only visited once in 7 years.", "I would split in the middle of the night.  Leave a note for him to watch the kids cause she is going on a girls trip.", "I don't think #2 is accurate. Looks like the dad bought the ticket.", ">(to work a job that leaves you guys strapped for cash, no less)\n\nThat job that leaves them strapped for cash is because husband is spending the money to take round trip flights to visit his family: (\"we have went to visit them at minimum 1-3 times per year\" and then this \"The weekend before X-mas he went with his parents and siblings to OK to visit his grandparents\".  And let's not forget that when you travel out of town, you also are taking spending money (at the minimum it's probably $400-500 per visit).", "NTA.\n\nHave to wonder if the parents/grandparents/siblings even know about this situation. Might be worth dumping a very public 'do you know how much this ruined our holiday' post to their social media and/or message them. Because I have to wonder if they did this on purpose or if they were in the dark about how this is affecting OP's family.", "yes especially when we will NEVER know all the details to any story!", "It\u2019s relevant because assuming he is lying about it being a gift is coloring her assessment of everything else that has happened.", "LoL, now you said it. It's a possibility!", "I oh yep, I thought dad bought tickets to the game but you are correct. The other points still stand so he\u2019s still the AH and not OP.", "He won't be there anyway, he'll be away \"working\".\nOP does he always go to the same cities?  Put an airtag or something similar in his luggage , see where he spends his time...hotel or house.\nRed flags for sure, maybe a few other women?", "It\u2019s worse in Texas!  Born and bred Texan and I don't give a damn about football", "In my opinion: NTA, however;\n\nI\u2019d bet that he told his dad that you both couldn\u2019t swing it financially. His dad took that to mean, shit if I fund the trip, he can go. And your husband doesn\u2019t exactly know how to back out of it, and doesn\u2019t want to look like an asshole.", "NTA - Even if you were totally fine with him going (which you aren\u2019t and have every right not to be), it still wouldn\u2019t be reasonable for him to expect you to wake up your kids on the wee hours of the morning to spend two hours in the car driving him to the airport.\n\nYour husband is behaving very selfishly.", "YTA - why are you with a man who doesn't prioritize the family he created but rather the one he came from? spoiler alert, he doesn't care abt y'all yet you've convinced yourself he does. grow a spine and show your daughter being treated this way is unacceptable.", "This to me sounds like an issue that you don't like how much he travels for work anyway, and it just is manifesting with this situation. \n\nI don't know your ages, but you are married and old enough to have kids in sports, so I'm going to guess you are in your 30s.  At that point, him going to see grandparents is kind of one of those things where you don't know how many years you have left with them, so a family trip to see them (when it doesn't sound like they travel to Texas) makes sense. \n\nI'd also argue, him wanting to do something big with his dad and brother is valid.  You get to see your family quite a bit more often than he gets to see his.   So when he does see his, its more of a big to do, because it requires more travel.  \n\nIt also sounds like you are basing a lot of things around your daughter.  You guys didn't go on the trip because she didn't want to miss holiday things.  You wanted him to stay because she would be off.  That is your choice to prioritize a child's wants over your husbands desire to see his family, when it sounds like your family is a big part of your life already.\n\nAlso, did you have something actually planned for this week off, or did you just think it would be a lot of sitting around drinking hot chocolate as a family?  When in reality, she'd be in her room, playing on her phone, and doing stuff with her friends.\n\nESH.  Both of you seem to be very unwilling to see the other person's side and consider their feelings.", "NTA.\n\nIt doesn't sound like he's emotionally invested in you or your kids, TBH, and that your house is just a place to store his stuff.", "NTA. I think it\u2019s important to ask yourself if you are truly happy in your marriage. Because you are married to someone who is incredibly selfish and his family supports it, while you staying with him enables it. So if you are happy, then fine. But if you are not, know that this will likely not change.", "The gall of him to book a trip behind your back (he is obviously lying about it being a surprise gift) and then asking you to get up at 3:30am to drive him to the airport.", "You are a single mom, he is a single man. That\u2019s just your life", "NTA you\u2019re already acting as a single mom, may as well get child support and alimony. At least that way he can\u2019t waste money. Assuming his Dad paid for the flight and tickets, he\u2019s still going to make purchases while out of town. \n\nHe also JUST saw them. He seems to show no interest in taking on an active role as a father and husband. He\u2019s going to spend the one week he could be bonding with his kids and helping you away? \n\nI would not be able to stay with someone that selfish.

Why does he seem to want to distance himself so much from you and the children? Does he not enjoy spending time with you all?\n\nI love my mom/dad too but I prioritize my wife/kids over everyone else, they're the family I chose and built, and while I owe a lot to my parents, I wouldn't want to neglect my own family for them.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "NTA do not let him go without consequences. Tell him if he goes that is when your separation starts and you will make it legal if you have to. Lay into him hard! This is unacceptable behavior and he is lying about not knowing.

Do not let him without severe consequences or this will keep happening.", "Just throwing this out there -- are you sure he's visiting his family and not having an affair?  This guy sure seems to be gone a lot, and spending time with you and his own children is clearly not a priority to him.\n\nAnd you are **absolutely** NTA for not driving him to the airport -- he's ditching you against your wishes and asking you to help him do it???  WTF???\n\nPlease contact a lawyer while he's gone, learn your rights and start setting things in motion to protect yourself and your children.  You're already a single parent, what do you have to lose?  A lot of heartache and rejection, from what it sounds like.", "He sounds incredibly selfish. Your NTA and I\u2019m sorry he\u2019s even made you question it. I\u2019m wondering why you\u2019re not looking for divorce attorneys? It doesn\u2019t even sound like your in a marriage.", "NTA at all. He\u2019s prioritizing a game over his family. It\u2019s about the game bc he just saw them. I\u2019d be super upset too. All the childcare responsibility is always on you. He\u2019s about to take off for most of Jan and he should be helping and wanting to spend as much time as he can with the kids while they\u2019re off. \n\nEven if you overlook all this it\u2019s messed up to wake up the whole family at 3:30 to take him to the airport.", "D-I-V-O-R-C-E", "NTA  \nOP, you're basically single parenting.

Like girl/guy math. \u201cI bought a $100 ticket so now I have to book a $600 flight.\u201d\n\nIf I was OP I would straight ask my FIL about the ticket.", "Exactly this. \n\n> I told him that we unfortunately couldn\u2019t. We really couldn\u2019t swing an unplanned trip financially right now and with wanting to travel so close to the holidays booking prices were extremely high.\n\nSounds like he only told his dad this was the reason he couldn't go, so the dad went ahead and \"solved\" the issue (finances)", "I\u2019d be tempted just to block him on everything.  That can be easily undone if an emergency comes up. For the time he is away, his entire family is a black hole. It would be interesting to see if that even bothers him at all\u2026.or he doesn\u2019t notice.", "...and the divorce and child support papers.  \n\nBet his family shows up on you doorstep the next day to complain!", "In OP's place, I might be tempted to tell him to change the ticket to one-way.", "This is one of those people who equates football with life", "So why didn't his family buy tickets for the whole family and not just him? He's just ditched his wife and kids for Christmas when he barely spends any time with them to start with. He's put himself before anyone else and then expects her to run around after him when they've obviously not got the money to cover it themselves. The wife is the only one in this scenario who isn't the AH.", "When you lay it out that way, I seriously wonder if OP's \"husband\" has an entire \"secret family\" he spends time with.  \n\nEven if he does not, he's an AH of epic proportions.
