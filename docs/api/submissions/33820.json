{"id": 33820, "submission_id": "18rnund", "title": "AITA for refusing to drive my husband to the airport and being upset he is leaving?", "selftext": "Some background, we live on the east coast and his family lives in TX. My family lives about 4 hours away. They drive to us for every holiday, birthday, dance recital, etc. We have lived here for roughly 7 years (before that, we lived in TX). His family takes several trips/vacations a year and only once, this past year, came to visit us. Over the 7 years we have went to visit them at minimum 1-3 times per year. My husband works out of town about 3 weeks a month so it\u2019s a lot of solo parenting for me. \n\nThe weekend before xmas he went with his parents and siblings to OK to visit his grandparents. Myself and my children were unable to go as my daughter  had holiday things going on at home she didn\u2019t want to miss. He came home the Monday before xmas and asked if we could swing a trip to TX after xmas to see his family and so his dad and him could go to the Alamo bowl. I told him that we unfortunately couldn\u2019t. We really couldn\u2019t swing an unplanned trip financially right now and with wanting to travel so close to the holidays booking prices were extremely high. I also explained to him that our daughter had off of school and all sports this week and that NEVER happens, especially when he is home too, and I really wanted this to be a week for us to all spend together. Especially since he will start traveling for work again on the 2nd of January and will not be home until the last week of January. \n\nThe day before Christmas Eve I was out shopping and he texted me saying he knew I was going to be mad but his dad had booked him a flight and bought tickets for himself, my husband, my BIL and MIL to all go to the game. He would return the 30th. I got upset because we had already talked about going and I said that we just couldn\u2019t swing it this year. His response was that he \u201cknew nothing about this and his dad surprised him with it for a last minute Xmas gift\u201d (which is a lie because they mailed our gifts to us and our children and he had received a Xmas gift). I asked him if everything had already been purchased as I would like him to not go. He said yes, and that he was going because it\u2019s something he really wanted to do. We haven\u2019t spoken much since then honestly because I feel very hurt that he doesn\u2019t want to spend time with myself and our children before a long work trip, after he\u2019s just seen his family last week, and would rather spend most of the week with his parents. He says that we could just book flights for myself and our kids to go but we honestly don\u2019t have the money and I\u2019m not maxing out a credit card for an unplanned trip. \n\nTonight he asked me if I will be driving him to the airport tomorrow morning for a 6 am flight. I told him that he will need to book an Uber because I\u2019m not waking our kids up at 3:30 am to drive an hour each way to the airport so that he can go on a trip that I don\u2019t even want him going on. He says that I\u2019m being unreasonable.

He literally sees you for 1/4 of the year, and that Quarter you are begging for him to actually be present and not visiting his family or doing whatever HE wants. When do YOU get a break? When do YOU get to just f it and fly to your parents and expect the other one to just pick up the pieces? This doesn\u2019t sound sustainable, you sound like a maid that he occasionally has a child with.", "Nta. If he would rather spend more time with his family then the family that he created then throw his stuff on the porch mail divorce papers to him while he is at his parents at peace the fuck out.", "NTA.  It's clear that his parents/grandparents/siblings take precedence over you and your children.  And his job.  You are way down on his list.  I would recommend couples counseling but even if his work didn't take him out of town for such long periods of time, I'm guessing he wouldn't go?  Time for some hard discussions and decisions on if this marriage is even worth being in.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry that you are going through this. He really has checked out as a husband and father.", "NTA kinda sounds like all his work trips have made him forget that he has a responsibility to his kids first and foremost. He just wants the bachelor life while you keep the home and do the child rearing and then he gets to pop in at his leisure.", "Do not drive him to the airport. I don\u2019t think you will even want to talk to him except to let him know that while he is gone you will be seriously considering whether your marriage is worth the sacrifices you make. Emphasize sacrifices. Do not make excuses for him to your children. Daughter is old enough to recognize selfishness. Don\u2019t let this be an example to them unless it\u2019s billed as a bad example. Do not communicate with him while he is gone. Or FIL. If you don\u2019t have a job get one. Do wonderful things over the holidays even if you must use a credit card.", "NTA- He doesn\u2019t even know your financial situation. He\u2019s all about leaving you and the kids for fun filled times paid for by his family. Cause he really wants to do this.  Re-evaluate.  And what\u2019s with his family anyway?", "HOLY COW NTA! he\u2019s not only a crappy husband and absentee father and your in-laws are funding his much needed vacation (insert eyeroll) before leaving his family for work. So you absolutely are NTA for not driving your husband to the airport, make sure not to pick him up either.", "NTA - He sounds like my ex. EX being the important part of that. If he is traveling so much for work and just visited his family, this is a pretty loud message that he doesn't want to spend quiet family time at hone.", "NTA\n\nEven if there wasn\u2019t the additional conflict here, expecting you and the kids to get up at 3:30am to give him a ride for his flight is ridiculous.\n\nEverything else makes him (and frankly, his father) the asshole.\n\nBecause his father absolutely should be able to recognize how important it is to be present for your own kids during the holiday, especially if you\u2019re gone most of the other time for work.", "Take the kids and go visit your parents the night before he comes home and stay a few days  if you can. Tell him it's something you really wanted to do and your mom surprised you with gas money. You just can't turn her down, she really wants to spend time with the family", "Why are you married to this person? Do you even have a relationship? Does he have any sort of positive relationship with his children? It sounds like he is either traveling for work or visiting his family and that cannot possibly be healthy for anyone. \n\nAdd to that, he does not appear to care about anyone in the family aside from himself and that is certainly not helpful in creating a healthy family dynamic. And he's selfish. \n\nNTA, in this immediate issue, but I feel like you may be because you are sticking with this guy and not providing yourself and your children a healthy homelife.", "NTA. Your husband is possibly one of the most self-centered and inconsiderate people I've read about in a while. Wake your kids up? No.", "So, his wants outweigh his family's needs and he thinks *you're* being unreasonable? I mean, I like football myself but I'd crawl over flaming shattered glass to be with my family on holidays, especially if I had a long work trip coming up. \n\nNTA, obviously. Does he even want to be married? Because this is a good way to end up not married.", "NTA and I hope you will show this thread to your husband that many people agree that this isn't normal behavior for families that are doing well together. I don't think I would be happy with a \"couple day a month\" husband and I'm sure your kids would like to have a dad who was around.", "That is ridiculous! Leave him! You never see him anyway and this obviously doesn\u2019t bother him. Have divorce papers drawn up and sent to him and change all the locks while he\u2019s gone. I\u2019m so mad on your and your children\u2019s behalf!", "NTA. Sounds like there's a second family. Either yours or another in TX. And I'm not talking about his parents, etc.", "Issues like this are why I'm glad to live within 45 minutes of most of our family, but still only see them a few times a year.", "NTA, of course. I would be tempted to ask the in-laws why they think its okay to take your husband away from his kids and wife during Christmas, especially since they had just seen him the week before. What is wrong with these people?", "He's selfish. Think about your relationship, including all the solo parenting due to his work related travel. He has now gone on two trips ina one month to be with his family.\n\nYou're his wife. You and your children are supposed to be his priority as you're his nuclear family.\n\nWhen does he do any parenting?\n\nWhen do you travel solo, leaving him with the kids?\n\nMight be time to decide whether you want to make it official and parent alone.", "Nta. You might as well file for divorce as you\u2019re already separated.", "NTA. You are already a single mother, why not make it official with the courts? He wants to live his bachelor lifestyle while you take care of the kids and home, let him. You\u2019ll find someone who will treat you a million times better than what you\u2019re getting now!", "NTA. It's bad enough that he's deserting his wife and children but let's add insult to injury...let's expect you and the kids to wake up at 3am to take me to the airport and be on the road for an hour so I can go have fun with the people who are really important to me.\nHe is one selfish a$$hole. Tell him dad should have booked him uber rides when he booked the plane ticket.", "Holy crap, why did he ever get married/have kids? It sure doesn\u2019t seem like he wants to spend time with his wife and children. (Asking you to drive him to the airport was the cherry on top \ud83d\ude44). Seems like he prefers the single lifestyle with few responsibilities. I don\u2019t know how you can stand to be married to him. I am so sorry. What a Christmas present for you and the kids\u2026\ud83d\ude14", "NTA", "Update me", "NTA, and I would tell him to stay there and not come back since he doesn't care and doesn't want to be with you and your child. He seems heartless and cold. Makes me wonder why everyone else is more important than you and your children. I seriously would tell him not to come back and that you need space and a separation. Harsh, yes, needed, IMO, yes, because he isn't even being a part-time dad or husband.", "NTA. \n\nYou know he asked his dad to buy the ticket.  That is just disrespectful.", "Tell him his mistress can take him...he spends an awful amount of time away from home for work to financially support the family, yet drops everything to get away from you all when he should be wanting to stay home with the family especially at Christmas, I wonder what's really going on.\nYNTA", "NTA, that would be your husband that doesn't prioritize you or your children over his parents.     You need to decide if him being an ass is a deal breaker especially since he doesn't show the same enthusiasm for being with his children that he does his parents.  \n\nYou both need therapy because you sound like his doormat where he does what he wants and doesn't care how it gets paid for where his family in Texas is concerned.  You do the heavy lifting and mental load with the children you share.  \n\nAs for being unreasonable, you aren't being unreasonable your spouse is being a PITA to the extreme.", "NTA. Change the locks while he\u2019s gone.", "He doesn\u2019t sound like he actually likes you very much if he doesn\u2019t look forward to spending time with you and the kids. Does he do this in other ways?", "NTA, but please ask yourself: would you miss him that much if you divorced? He's hardly ever home and when he is he doesn't prioritize you and your kids. Custodial time might mean he sees them more then he does now.", "Nta. I would divorce him. Your kids deserve better.", "NTA...quite honestly you are being nicer than most people would be.\n\nClearly you and your feelings don't mean shit to your husband nor his family.", "NTA what a load! I\u2019m so sorry OP the blatant disrespect to you and your children is so wild.", "Imagine throwing away your marriage to watch OU choke in a mediocre bowl game.\n\nNTA.", ">My husband works out of town about 3 weeks a month\n\nINFO: how long has he has this 3/1 week schedule? How far out of town?\n\nNTA for not driving him. That part isn't even about the messiness of this trip. It's incomprehensible why a parent would want their family to wake up so early to drive them an hour to the airport. Then, you'd be driving another hour alone with a sleepy/cranky 10 year old & 1 year old.", "Are the kids from his secret family the same ages as yours? You should try to arrange playdates after you move closer to your family. Does the secret family live closer to his parents, and are they keeping his secret?", "NTA. Tell him his dad can pay for the Uber, too.", "NTA\n\nAnything else I could say would be removed by the mods", "NTA. Honey. Do not take him, don't pick him up. You two need to reevaluate his and your position. Nobody deserves to be treated like a doormat. I'm sorry to be blunt, but him telling you to get the kids up at 3:30 so daddy can go play in TX is bs. It's insulting. He's dumping his own children to go party in TX? And grandkids weren't invited? Are you positive he's going to be with family? I sure would need photos.", "NTA. He works that much away from home and still doesn\u2019t make enough for you to be comfortable paying for a trip like this? Why is it worth it, then? Because he has no parental responsibilities? Think about it\u2026", "NTA you need to check his email and social media accounts immediately. He has a second secret family or a gf. His story just isn\u2019t right.", "NTA but girl what are you doing?  Your a married single parent. Do you get anything out of this relationship anymore?  It seems you do everything and your husband just does whatever the hell he wants.  He doesn\u2019t care (or doesn\u2019t care enough) about you and your family. Don\u2019t tolerate his disrespect.", "NTA.  At this point, will anything really be different if you were a single parent? He's home one week a month and now that your kids are home for Christmas break, he wants to be gone again for a football game that is a 1 day event. Other than contributing financially, what else is he bringing to the table? When does he make you and your kids a priority? Has he asked for or planned time for just the two of you? Has he ever acknowledged that you do the majority of the parenting, running of the household, upkeep on the house and yard, bill paying, appointments, etc and thanked you for it or expressed any appreciation? I'm not saying you should make the leap to divorce him but highlighting the fact that he is absent for so much. \n\nFrom the brief glimpse of your married life you've given us, some of these questions may not be fair of me to ask. However, it sounds as if you are extremely frustrated and hurt and that his selfishness is a reoccurring issue. And the fact that his family is willing to buy HIM a plane ticket for a visit but not you and the kids comes off as rude and hurtful. I'm willing to bet that after the first conversation about the football game, he threw you under the bus and said you weren't going to let him go. \n\nIf you can and want to, spend some time with your family. Or, it sounds like life is busy with sports and activities, so maybe you and the kids would love some pajama days where everyone can relax and watch movies and just chill. However you choose to spend the time your husband is away, please give thought and consideration to what works and doesn't work in your marriage; what you can compromise on and what you can't; what you absolutely NEED from him going forward. \n\nHe needs to understand this isn't about a football game or a trip to see his family. It's about him prioritizing his wants and the desires and whims of his parents over his wife and child. It's about him literally choosing to NOT spend time with his wife and kids and having Daddy buy him a plane ticket to do it. It's about his inability to deny himself something he wants for the good of his wife and kids.", "NTA. \n\nSo, to clarify, this is probably the only week of the whole year where other obligations wouldn't interfere with complete family time... and he is leaving? \n\nPlease evaluate how he supports and loves your family in ways outside of finances. If that list is not extensive, you may want to rethink what type of relationship you have. Being a single mom only gets easier when you are actually single instead of married. \n\nMy husband is military, and until the last 2 years was gone regularly for long periods of time. When he came home, his only priority was spending as much time as possible with us as a family and each of us individually.\n\nPeople who love their families would never voluntarily choose to spend more time away from them when obligations already keep them separated regularly.", "nta, he planned the trip so he can plan his ride to and from the airport", "NTA", "NTA\n\nThere is no easy way to say this, but your husband is a major AH. You are already effectively a single mother as it is. maybe it is time to formalise that.\n\nTell him if he goes, not to bother coming back.\n\nLawyer up and get rid of him. Boot him out.\n\nhe can't be bothered to spend time with his family when he is not working away", "NTA. If he's OK w you maxing out a card, go somewhere with the kids. He made his choice.", "Have you considered when he comes back, to just be gone? Take the kids to visit your parents. They can miss school for a week. Let him sit by himself.", "INFO: does your husband like you?", "NTA. Your husband isn't putting you or your children first. \n\nIt's time to sit him down and talk to him about priorities.", "NTA.....oh boy reading this made me so mad. Your husband is being so unbelievably selfish ..... I just can't even. This is a man that's not a part of your family.", "Honestly I\u2019d tell him to go and have fun. But also make sure to pack everything he owns to take with him since he has made his choice. I\u2019m sure you love him but what do you actually need him for? He has no issue leaving you to do everything so make it easier for him and continue to do just that.", "You\u2019re unreasonable!!! He\u2019s an AH! Talk about taking his family for granted, I feel like he\u2019s saying \u201cahhh they\u2019ll always be there\u201d I\u2019m going. I really hope you made him take an Uber!!", "NTA - I was so ready to lay into you but your husband is being ridiculous. When does he even see you guys? I know spending time with his parents is important, but he\u2019s got to prioritize you and the kids\u2026 at least sometimes! Wow.", "You are NTA.  You are married to a spoiled, selfish brat who is completely taking you and your daughter for granted.  If he were my husband, he would come home to divorce papers, changed locks, and all his stuff packed up.  Please consider the example your relationship is setting for your daughter.  Do.not.pick.him.up.from.the.airport.", "There's a problem in your story. \n\nHaving already received Christmas gifts in the mail does not mean it is necessarily a lie that someone received another gift. \n\nYTA. If you're going to make up stuff to be mad at, YTA.", "NTA.. I wouldn\u2019t even want to be there when he gets back. Better yet, tell him to go ahead & stay there & mail him his Christmas gift.. divorce papers. What\u2019s the point of prolonging what seems inevitable? He doesn\u2019t want to be there & you deserve to be able to sort yourself & move on with your life in grace & dignity, not counting on your jerk of a husband to disappoint you & your kids any further. He already one foot out of the door.. help him all the way out. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s just my trauma, but I\u2019m inclined to believe it\u2019s not just work, & only his parents he keeps leaving you for. Sounds like the man has a double life & you & your kids are not the main one.", "NTA\n\nI hate to break it to you, but you don't have a husband. You have a long distance financial sponsor who isn't interested in prioritizing your immediate family.", "NTA. Your husband\u2019s behaviour is grounds for divorce. Serious question if you did actually divorce your husband would his role and his participation change all that much in the family? If The answer is no, you have a lot to think about.", "NTA\n\nYour husband is the ahole. I also think your he is likely making a lot of other bad decisions behind your back.", "YTA.  You and your daughter could have gone on the trip as well and enjoyed the holiday with his family as well as attending a big-time football game.  Then refusing to drive him to the airport is just petty.  Perhaps it wasn't your dream for the time, but it was one that could easily have worked well.  \n\nMakes me wonder if the decision to have a job that requires so much out of town travel is intentional.", "NTA - He's being a terribly bad husband and father, but he wants *you* to go out of *your way* to help him do it?  What an ass.  \n\nHe's skipping out on his family in exchange for what, a game?  Why are your in-laws  encouraging him to do this? \n\nSeriously, I wouldn't want him back after this.  He's showing you who he is and you should believe him. Then get a great lawyer.", "NTA\n\nSweetie, you do not have a husband. You have a sperm donor mostly absent roommate who pays rent.  He clearly wants nothing to do with you or the kids right now. \n\nYou need to take the time while he is away to decide if there is enough of your relationship that exists that you want to try to fight to make things better or if you just need to cut your losses and move on without him. \n\nYou are already doing it all without him and when you try to ask him for help, he runs to mommy and daddy.", "He is away for work for extreme amounts of time and wants to spend all his free time with his extended family and not you and the kids and you are being unreasonable?

And that you will just accept it and forgive him. If I was you I would take a good hard look at how many times he has done things like this and if it\u2019s a lot, do u want to put up with this for the rest of your life. You are basically a married single parent. Three weeks out of a month he is away for work and his free time isn\u2019t spent with you and the kids, sounds like he doesn\u2019t care.", "What is he bringing to this relationship that wouldn't have the exact same result if he were to just pay child support?", "I hope every decision you make regarding your husband and his family from here on out keeps one fact very clear and in the forefront of your mind:\n\nIt's not that he doesn't understand. He just *does not care*. He consciously and in full awareness of what that meant for everyone involved decided to overrule your decision in favour of *his* trip with *his* dad during one of the most stressful times of the year, leaving all parenting to you and only you so he could chill at mom's for a bit.\n\nBecause I can tell you right now: More decisions like that will follow and there's no way this was the first either.\n\nNTA - watch your back. He won't.", "NTA. Sounds like he is selfish and maybe cheating.", "NTA. He is for asking you to drive at that ungodly hour alone (never mind the fact that he doesn't want to spend any time with the family he created). Is he too good for airport parking?

And if I were you, when he got back he could pick his things up from the front lawn on his way to his new place.", "NTA even if you had no problem with the trip, driving him to the airport is a completely unreasonable request.

He flew out of state with his family a week ago.\n\n2. He is flying out of state again, even though you can\u2019t afford it, bought tickets last minute at the highest prices during the most expensive time of year.\n\n3.

He\u2019s doing it on the only week he can possibly spend with his (actual) family that he made for a whole month.\n\n5.

He gets around the financial part by obviously telling his family who then pay for the plane ticket.\n\nHis family isn't supporting you. They have undermined you. Your husband is selfish and will do whatever he wants.\n\nYou're already a single mom. You're NTA.

My family lives about 4 hours away. They drive to us for every holiday, birthday, dance recital, etc. We have lived here for roughly 7 years (before that, we lived in TX). His family takes several trips/vacations a year and only once, this past year, came to visit us. Over the 7 years we have went to visit them at minimum 1-3 times per year. My husband works out of town about 3 weeks a month so it\u2019s a lot of solo parenting for me. \n\nThe weekend before xmas he went with his parents and siblings to OK to visit his grandparents. Myself and my children were unable to go as my daughter  had holiday things going on at home she didn\u2019t want to miss. He came home the Monday before xmas and asked if we could swing a trip to TX after xmas to see his family and so his dad and him could go to the Alamo bowl. I told him that we unfortunately couldn\u2019t. We really couldn\u2019t swing an unplanned trip financially right now and with wanting to travel so close to the holidays booking prices were extremely high. I also explained to him that our daughter had off of school and all sports this week and that NEVER happens, especially when he is home too, and I really wanted this to be a week for us to all spend together. Especially since he will start traveling for work again on the 2nd of January and will not be home until the last week of January. \n\nThe day before Christmas Eve I was out shopping and he texted me saying he knew I was going to be mad but his dad had booked him a flight and bought tickets for himself, my husband, my BIL and MIL to all go to the game. He would return the 30th. I got upset because we had already talked about going and I said that we just couldn\u2019t swing it this year. His response was that he \u201cknew nothing about this and his dad surprised him with it for a last minute Xmas gift\u201d (which is a lie because they mailed our gifts to us and our children and he had received a Xmas gift). I asked him if everything had already been purchased as I would like him to not go. He said yes, and that he was going because it\u2019s something he really wanted to do. We haven\u2019t spoken much since then honestly because I feel very hurt that he doesn\u2019t want to spend time with myself and our children before a long work trip, after he\u2019s just seen his family last week, and would rather spend most of the week with his parents. He says that we could just book flights for myself and our kids to go but we honestly don\u2019t have the money and I\u2019m not maxing out a credit card for an unplanned trip. \n\nTonight he asked me if I will be driving him to the airport tomorrow morning for a 6 am flight. I told him that he will need to book an Uber because I\u2019m not waking our kids up at 3:30 am to drive an hour each way to the airport so that he can go on a trip that I don\u2019t even want him going on. He says that I\u2019m being unreasonable. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

His dad removed the financial argument and the 2-3 hours of the game isn't long if the whole fam is in TX together.\n\nPersonally, when it became clear the family wanted this to be a thing I would have offered a compromise.  We can't afford the flight to keep this to a 1-2 day event so you aren't missing the quality time.

Are his children even comfortable around him? He is acting like he has no responsibility to your family. \n\nI bet he never thinks about how you NEVER get a break.

Clearly your children are young (ie not teens) as you can't leave them sleeping in their beds. Why does he not want to spend the holidays with you and the children during the holidays so you guys can make memories together? Why are his parents more important than his wife and children? Does he realize how selfish he is being or does he not care? These are questions I would be asking him. \n \nThe next time he comes back for a week. You should plan a vacation just for yourself.

How does that constitute traveling to see a football game, which doesn't take place until December 28th?  Plus, he just got back from a trip to Oklahoma with his family.  I don't know why he couldn't have flown out early on the 27th to Texas. Why did he actually have to be gone on Christmas Day? Things just aren't adding up for me. Also, the mere fact that you and your children are so absolutely meaningless to him that he's willing to do this to you, tells you that he just doesn't give a damn about any of you any more. Why waste your time with him? You're letting him get away with absolute murder, and he's going to keep doing it.\n\nIf his parents live in Texas, are they flying him there and then the whole family will drive to the football game? What's the deal? Will he be staying with them the entire time?\n\nAre you absolutely positive he's not cheating on you? Parents have often been known to lie to help cover up their children's infidelity. The absolute gall of this man in being gone so much is such a huge red flag to me. Please look into this carefully, and don't give away the fact that you're suspicious (if you are), but make sure you do everything you can to protect yourself financially and emotionally if you end up having to confront him.

And it sounds like it's the grandparents choice not to see the kids often, they travel frequently to other places but not to see the kids. Grandparents can fork out for the whole family if they want to see them (however it's clear they only want to see their son).", "I think I speak for the rest of the posters and say that you are a complete moron and should never, under any circumstances, reproduce.", "That\u2019s what I was thinking! What a trash game to abandon your family for.", "Why is he like this? Well, his parents don\u2019t come across much better in what\u2019s described. They want him to visit (and bribe him with the bowl game), but don\u2019t care much about his kids (either him spending time with them, or coming to see them themselves).", "I would be DONE if I were in your situation. I would have legal paperwork for him to sign and full luggage upon his return.", "Yep, but she is full of negativities. When he told her that Gramps had just bought tickets, she called him a liar. What if he wasn\u2019t lying? What if she is the type of wife who\u2019s always accusing the husband of lying? Maybe he has just given up because she is always quick to judge him incorrectly.", "Ikr. \n\nTell him to just stay with his family.", "I feel better I'm not the only one who said this. It sounds so damn harsh but really, not getting the vibe he likes his immediate family or at least spending time with them which is depressing to say the least.", "no kidding, poor kids", "Yep.  Came here to see if this had already been suggested.    \n\nOp, don\u2019t be there when he gets home.   Go to your family for New Year\u2019s Eve.   Have an awesome time.   Come back whenever you want to come back.", "But* not put sorry forgot to proof read", "But then OP is far from her support network, when she\u2019s the one holding down the fort for three weeks a month", "I'm going to guess you missed the part where he is away from his wife and kids 3 out of 4 weeks a month. Not her family but his own wife and kids. She is a single mother damn near all the time. Please elaborate on what part of that you do not understand.", "I mean how do they buy tickets to a game with the whole family but exclude his wife and kids? Wtf", "No doubt.", "Lmao at this comment NTA", "There we go. That's the comment I was looking for!", "He spends those 3 weeks with his secret family", "I'd outright ask him if he wants a divorce because his behaviour normally results in a divorce.", "Post says Alamo bowl. Arizona vs Oklahoma. He's not going to the Rose bowl.", "I was wondering if OP and kids is the second family.\n\n(BTW, NTA... another thing I don't understand is the seemingly unique American obsession with college football.)", "Agreed! If I worked away from home for 3 weeks out of a month, wild horses couldn\u2019t drag me from my family for that other week", "It wouldn\u2019t shock me either. He does seem really checked out of the relationship.

It is not a big game whatsoever.", "Its the Alamo Bowl actually. I know exactly what the Texas toxic mentality around college football and bowl games is...it truly doesnt matter. Its still just football and he doesnt even live in Texas anymore...he is basically telling his kids they are unimportant. At this point he isnt a parent, hes a paycheck and a sperm donor, with being gone 3 out of 4 weeks. And then to choose to be gone a 4th week...just nah. So she might as well make it official.", "Exactly what I was thinking. He\u2019s got something else going on . He knew she would say no to going to see his family. He\u2019s a selfish person. His father must be too.", "Oh my goodness, same! After reading the post, my first thought was if OP was sure all those trips were for work or were they for \"work.\"", "Such a parasitic mindset", "Would want to be an amazing game to prompt someone to abandon all semblance of being a responsible parent.\n\nOP may as well file the papers. She's already a single mother as it is", "You don\u2019t need to have money issues to not be able to afford multiple last minute airline tickets around the holidays. That shit is expensive.", "If be consulting with an attorney this week anyways.", "OP should consider doing that AND take the kids and go to her family's to stay if they would let her because this isn't gonna get better for OP.\n\nOP IF you feel comfortable doing it, please give us an update.  Some of us really would like to know how things went for you.  Fingers crossed.", "Wait and do it on his birthday or your anniversary", "I know an adult man that always prioritizes his family of origin over his wife and 2 children. It\u2019s bizarre especially because his 3 siblings are exactly the same way, it\u2019s like they still see their birth family (specifically Dad, Mom, and the 4 siblings) as the center of their entire universe and everyone \u201cnew\u201d are regarded as secondary. Distant relatives needed to catered to and impressed, though. It really makes me wonder what the hell their parents did to inspire such strong loyalty? Their Dad was a terrible, selfish person that screwed them all over financially, repeatedly but they all cry at his grave, weekly! \n\nBut anyway I was thinking about these people the whole time I read this post.", "If the children even know who he is.", "I'm actually wondering if he really has another family. Or families.", "Too late\u2026Already done, and a grandparent and buying plane tickets for Family so we can build memories. \nYou gotta read between the lines\u2026 This relationship is doomed, but it is as much her fault as it is his. His family sees this and because they don\u2019t like the dynamics of the marriage, they stay away. That\u2019s probably why they haven\u2019t visited in 7 years. They aren\u2019t visiting because they don\u2019t feel welcome. She\u2019s got some resentment and yep, it\u2019s probably a catch 22 and it has developed a life of its own. Any older person can tell you, when you hit 50, you realize you don\u2019t need stuff, All you want is family and building memories. She doesn\u2019t sound like a person who lives by this belief so they are going to build memories without her.", "Or inviting them on either of these 2 trips", "Honestly, with every other selfish ah thing he did, I wouldn't trust that he really got the flight and game tickets as a gift vs. having to pay someone back. He wants to spend money they don't have so the kids can go because OP is mad. He is so disrespectful of OP that lying to get his way seems well within the realm of possibility", "She didn't call him a liar,  she asked if she knew this was happening and questioned why his father would suddenly provide him with an extra xmas gift when they had already sent gifts. It's extremely suspicious that his father would tag on a vacation to xmas gifts without some discussion with his son,  especially when he had seen him so recently. This man is actively choosing his family of origin over his children and wife. He is removing himself from the household regularly. Please tell me what positives there are here?  He's abandoning his family to go on a holiday. I don't see any incorrect judgement here. If he's given up then he does the adult thing and speaks to his wife about it, if he's so unhappy in the relationship that he would rather spend the holidays on vacation with his parents and siblings then he needs to grow up and get a divorce.", "Most likely they didn't buy and the husband did but lied because he was going no matter what and didn't want to hear shit", "I mean, that\u2019s my thought, too.", "I don't understand the obsession either, and I live in the US. It's completely bizarre to me.", "Exactly. Not at all like attending the Rose Bowl. And presumably neither of these is his alma mater. And he probably hates OU anyway! I don't understand why they even want to go to this game so badly. And I'm a huge college football fan. Trying to imagine myself in a similar scenario and just....no way. Nope.", "That was my thought. It sounds like he's seeing someone and using his parents as a cover.\n\nI would call the landline, of my in-laws, after the big game and ask to speak to dear ol hubby. I would just be curious to see if he's really staying there.", "Found the husband", "If you say so, buddy. Don\u2019t care.", "Yeah, I'd have the locks changed and papers ready to serve by his return. This man is away from \"home\" 75% of the time and doesn't give a damn about spending holidays with his kid much less his wife? He's checked out of this family, not just the marriage.", "If there is ever an Olympic category for jumping to conclusions, you win.", "She wants her children to have some memories of their father, which is next to impossible to achieve with him traveling 3 out of 4 weeks for work and traveling the rest of the time solo to visit his (grand)parents instead of seeing his kids.", "They (OP+kids) were welcome to go, and did actually opt out of the first trip due to the daughter\u2019s activities. But they weren\u2019t being paid for while OP\u2019s husband was, and they would have been waiting around while the others went to the bowl game.", "She did say he lied, even though the statement is quite likely true.  He probably told his dad he couldn't afford the trip, so they covered it for the family.  The OP is choosing to stay behind.", "haha ok fair", "The husband is in the wrong and vindictive selfish people are in the wrong too.", "Of course you wouldn't care giving out that type of advice, you lack empathy.", "This borderline sounds like a guy with a second family type of deal", "Husbands dad didn't cover it for the family, he covered it for husband only. In the post OP says that husband said that she could book tickets for her and the kids to tag along, but they can't afford it and OP doesn't want to max out a credit card on an unplanned trip", "I get where you arw getting that and we are picking it up differently: it's a lie that it's a last minue gift because he already has a gift.  You don't buy last minute gifts for people if you have already sent a gift\n OP cannot afford to go,  that's not a choice.  Husband ia actively choosing to leave his choosen family behind. If he was a functioning adult at all he could easily see how unreasonable he is being.", "It's 100% not selfish and vindictive to claim what's rightfully yours after you've given up your life, your body, and your sanity to keep house & raise children. If he wants to fanny off and do his own thing, then he has to pay up to maintain his partner and his family in the manner in which they are accustomed to.", "Quite the opposite, actually. I have immense empathy for OP and her child(ren), which is why I am giving her the advice she needs. She needs to maximize the amount of money she will get every month to take care of her child the best she can.", "I was thinking the same thing!", "No borderline at all but OP already feels like crap, I didn't need to make it worse. It doesn't really matter what he's doing when he's not home, because even when he's home he's still not home. I don't see any hope for this relationship.", "I reread the post, and I am not seeing that explicitly stated.  Was it in a later comment?", "By taking advantage of a system and being vindictive is not a good way to live life, you lack empathy because you're happy to punish another and even supporting the idea of divorce because of something like this and trying to \"maximize\" what she can take from him by abusing this system", "\"He says that we could just book flights for myself and our kids to go but we honestly don\u2019t have the money and I\u2019m not maxing out a credit card for an unplanned trip.\"", "It\u2019s not taking advantage of a system at all. If she hasn\u2019t worked in a while and has been a stay at home mom, then her earnings are going to be significantly less than his. It\u2019s smarter for her to wait. But of course you don\u2019t see it that way, because I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve never been a stay at home mom who depends on another person financially. \n\nYes, women who earn less than their husbands should maximize alimony and child support and I\u2019m not going to apologize or feel guilty for saying that.", "He takes what he wants from this marriage while she sacrifices. The advice is spot on. He needs to hold up his part he created in this family. She also needs to throw him out and protect the home SHE'S built for the family.", "I did miss that, but why not just ask his parents for the money or the tickets since they are hosting the rest?", "They didn't book OP or the children originally, they obviously don't want them there. This is a case of a grown man choosing his Family of origin over his wife ans children, with his family of origin backing him up. This man is living like he's single and has no responsibilities, he has no consideration for hia children or wife.  He saw his family or origin a few weeka ago,  leaving his chosen family behind because the children has activities to participate in. He is now leaving them behind again. This isn't the way you treat your wife and children if you are a good husband and father. He is telling his wife ans children they don't matter as much as a vacation with his parents.", "That is reading a lot into this.  I also do not agree with the concept of \"origin family\" and \"chosen family\" in this context.  We are seeing different concepts of the OP."]}
