Have you considered that he may have an auditory processing issue and is not doing this maliciously as you assume?   \n\n\nOftentimes, people will ask you to repeat something because their brain didn't process what you said yet. As you are repeating it, they catch on to what you said, and then they can answer it. This situation you are describing sounds very much like a situation I have with a family member who has ADHD and an auditory processing disorder. They don't even realize they asked you to repeat something because it's a natural response when their brain is attempting to decipher what you just said.", "NAH, you literally only waited a couple of seconds. I think it's pretty common for various reasons for people to have a bit of a delay in auditory processing. I think what's happening is that he hears you, but hasn't processed the words, so when he asks you to repeat yourself it's because he literally doesn't know what you said. But then a few seconds later his brain catches up and then he *does* know, so instead of continuing to have you say the exact same thing again, he starts answering. So you don't need to \"call him out on it\", and he doesn't need to pridefully deny it (if he even realizes that's what's happening). But I think waiting a couple of seconds is pretty harmless.", "Your friend is ridiculous.  There was nothing harsh about simply waiting a couple of seconds.\n\nYou've dealt with the problem *perfectly*.  \n\nYour father hears and understands you.  His immediate response of \"you said what?\" Is a verbal tic, an unthinking automatic phrase he employs every time he is asked a question.\n\nYou've disrupted his expected call-and-response by choosing to not give the response.\n\nThis annoying verbal habit is not uncommon.  Many people respond with some variation of \"What?\" when they are spoken to.  It's their way of giving themselves a moment to formulate an answer.\n\nContinue to wait for his response. If he specifically asks you to repeat the question,  never, ever repeat the question word-for-word.  Reformulate it, so he has to listen.\n\nTo help break him of the habit, try to say, \"Dad,\" and get him to look up at you before you begin to speak.\n\nNTA.", "NAH. This could just be a conversational habit of your dad's, where he asks you to repeat yourself to buy him time to answer--similar to people who say \"Um\" a lot. However, it could also be a sign of other things--he has hearing loss, trouble processing the question, or maybe you mumble.  In all instances, he thinks he understood it the first time but just wants confirmation.  \n\nI certainly understand your frustration, but instead of playing games with him, why not do some research or get some tests done to rule out medical issues?", "NTA it seems to me.  Just say \"I was giving you a minute to process\" with a smile and move on.\n\nIs this new behavior - could it be a result of some loss of hearing causing him to have a delay processing speech?", "NTA. I had a hearing problem and often asked people to repeat themselves. When I got the hearing problem fixed it took forever for me to train my brain not to ask what people are saying (and still occasionally slip). Not saying the exact same for him, but it takes time and willingness to break a habit.", "No one is the AH. It sounds like your dad has a hearing problem as you are describing me and my husband. My husband is now deaf in one ear and almost deaf in the other. It\u2019s a frustrating situation for all including my husband.", "NTA.  I don't even understand how he could be upset with you here, except maybe as a way to mask his embarrassment that he proved your point.  Is he this way with everyone?  Is it a power play on his part?  Does he take extra time to process auditory clues?  I don't understand, but NTA regardless.  And I don't understand how it was harsh either.", "Excellent way to handle it. NTA", "Sounds like you dealt with it just fine.  My (F) partner (M) will often holler from the kitchen, \"Where's the (thing he wants)?\"  I used to answer and even go in there to point at the thing, which eventually got irritating because the thing was always *right there in front of him*.  Nowadays after he asks, I just wait 2-3 seconds and he'll yell back, \"Found it!\" \n\nA friend of mine calls that his Summoning Spell.", "I think you\u2019re being a little bit harsh with the \u201cpretends he doesn\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about\u201d thing, because this sort of reads like you think he\u2019s doing it on purpose to be annoying or something? \nJust so you know, a lot of people who have trouble with audio processing do something similar to your dad. They usually ask you to repeat because they didn\u2019t understand you \u2014 they may *hear* what you say but they have to untangle it before they can process it. So, they ask \u201cwhat?\u201d while figuring out what you said, and then answer as soon as they understand. \n\n(If someone talks to you in a loud room, and you hear their voice but you couldn\u2019t make out the words, you\u2019d ask them to repeat themselves, right? If you wait a few seconds, you can probably figure it out based on context, but if they\u2019re expecting you to answer right away, you\u2019re probably just gonna want them to say it again. Audio processing issues are pretty similar to that, except it\u2019s all the time. I handle mine by trying to pause before I reply, and throwing in a verbal filled word like \u201cum\u201d while I process, so my conversation partner doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m ignoring them, but plenty of people are going to have an automatic \u201cwhat?\u201d reaction when they don\u2019t understand you)\n\nI don\u2019t blame you for being irritated with interruptions, but I would ask you to please bear in mind that he isn\u2019t trying to be rude or doing it on purpose.", "NTA.   He answered the question without you repeating it. That shows he purposely was asking you to repeat in order for him to.interrupt you.  I don't think it's harsh. It's what he deserves. I'd continue to ask once and not repeat myself.", "NTA. Does he interrupt everyone this way or just you? It kinda sounds like a power move and he didn\u2019t like that you didn\u2019t respond how he wants this time.", "YTA - and abelist. Many people with hearing loss have co-morbid auditory processing disconnects. Please educate yourself and be a bit more compassionate to people with disabilities.", "YTA he sounds like he has delayed auditory processing.\n\nYou need to be patient with him.  Hidden disabilities can be very difficult to live with.  Be nice to him.", "YTA. What is the issue? How does this inconvenience you? So you have to repeat a few words? Clearly that's how his thought process works. Parents eventually have behaviors that annoy us. I'm sure you've done things for 29 years that have pissed him off. Deal with it and laugh about it behind closed doors with your siblings or cousins or significant other like everyone else. Every single person you meet is going to piss you off some way or another. Its your dad. Get over it. \n\nIf this is a new behavior or you feel like he has some sort of psychological issue, then maybe he needs to talk to his doctor and that is a very different kind of conversation that you need to have.", "NTA\nYou handled it fine. I hate repeating myself also. It\u2019s weird that he does that. I personally wouldn\u2019t bother speaking to him at all if he continued interrupting me", "YTA\n\nAuditory Perception Disorder is a real issue.
