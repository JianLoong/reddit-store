Have you considered that he may have an auditory processing issue and is not doing this maliciously as you assume?   \n\n\nOftentimes, people will ask you to repeat something because their brain didn't process what you said yet. As you are repeating it, they catch on to what you said, and then they can answer it. This situation you are describing sounds very much like a situation I have with a family member who has ADHD and an auditory processing disorder. They don't even realize they asked you to repeat something because it's a natural response when their brain is attempting to decipher what you just said.", "NAH, you literally only waited a couple of seconds. I think it's pretty common for various reasons for people to have a bit of a delay in auditory processing. I think what's happening is that he hears you, but hasn't processed the words, so when he asks you to repeat yourself it's because he literally doesn't know what you said. But then a few seconds later his brain catches up and then he *does* know, so instead of continuing to have you say the exact same thing again, he starts answering. So you don't need to \"call him out on it\", and he doesn't need to pridefully deny it (if he even realizes that's what's happening). But I think waiting a couple of seconds is pretty harmless.", "Your friend is ridiculous.  There was nothing harsh about simply waiting a couple of seconds.\n\nYou've dealt with the problem *perfectly*.  \n\nYour father hears and understands you.  His immediate response of \"you said what?\" Is a verbal tic, an unthinking automatic phrase he employs every time he is asked a question.\n\nYou've disrupted his expected call-and-response by choosing to not give the response.\n\nThis annoying verbal habit is not uncommon.  Many people respond with some variation of \"What?\" when they are spoken to.  It's their way of giving themselves a moment to formulate an answer.\n\nContinue to wait for his response. If he specifically asks you to repeat the question,  never, ever repeat the question word-for-word.  Reformulate it, so he has to listen.\n\nTo help break him of the habit, try to say, \"Dad,\" and get him to look up at you before you begin to speak.\n\nNTA.", "NAH. This could just be a conversational habit of your dad's, where he asks you to repeat yourself to buy him time to answer--similar to people who say \"Um\" a lot. However, it could also be a sign of other things--he has hearing loss, trouble processing the question, or maybe you mumble.  In all instances, he thinks he understood it the first time but just wants confirmation.  \n\nI certainly understand your frustration, but instead of playing games with him, why not do some research or get some tests done to rule out medical issues?", "NTA it seems to me.  Just say \"I was giving you a minute to process\" with a smile and move on.\n\nIs this new behavior - could it be a result of some loss of hearing causing him to have a delay processing speech?", "NTA. I had a hearing problem and often asked people to repeat themselves.

They usually ask you to repeat because they didn\u2019t understand you \u2014 they may *hear* what you say but they have to untangle it before they can process it. So, they ask \u201cwhat?\u201d while figuring out what you said, and then answer as soon as they understand. \n\n(If someone talks to you in a loud room, and you hear their voice but you couldn\u2019t make out the words, you\u2019d ask them to repeat themselves, right? If you wait a few seconds, you can probably figure it out based on context, but if they\u2019re expecting you to answer right away, you\u2019re probably just gonna want them to say it again. Audio processing issues are pretty similar to that, except it\u2019s all the time. I handle mine by trying to pause before I reply, and throwing in a verbal filled word like \u201cum\u201d while I process, so my conversation partner doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m ignoring them, but plenty of people are going to have an automatic \u201cwhat?\u201d reaction when they don\u2019t understand you)\n\nI don\u2019t blame you for being irritated with interruptions, but I would ask you to please bear in mind that he isn\u2019t trying to be rude or doing it on purpose.", "NTA.

People with this issue often beat themselves down for it and feel self-conscious or lacking anyway.  I would anticipate some hesitation from you father to speak or engage with you for a while.  He\u2019s going to feel very self-conscious and judged for a bit unless you reach out.  A good trick is to start a statement off with \u201cdad\u201d to get his attention.

Good luck and I hope it gets better.\n\nEdit: YTA not ETA or NAH just because of how I assume you made your dad feel.  That feeling is pure worthlessness and not deserving of love, you want to vanish to protect those you love from having to be around you.  It\u2019s awful.

This step made him either notice it or admit it, even if he only admits it to himself. That at least cracks the door for an actual conversation.\n\neta: I'd forgotten the above commenter's initial reply to you, and yeah, I'm reluctant to call someone an asshole at all if they aren't aware of a medical condition causing an issue. They didn't exactly teach coping skills back then. Best case scenario is that he's willing to learn them now.", "I was offering you relevant information that your last statement indicates you didnt have.

Here is why.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>she carries no more blame than he does for not knowing about his possible condition\n\nI am not blaming OP's Dad for his condition, whatever it may be - but it is  Dad's *duty* to do his best to make sure his auditory processing disorder (or whatever) doesn't negatively impact others as best he can. This is true for everyone who is neuro-divergent in some way, and also true for people who are neuro-typical. It is on all of us to not be assholes. \n\nOP isn't upset Dad needs extra time to process and respond, OP isn't even upset Dad buys himself processing time with a request for repetition - OP is upset that when Dad buys himself time, he *always* does so in a way that involves interrupting/interjecting/cutting off. This is rude.\n\nImagine a similar scenario with a similar Dad. Dad does the exact same thing he always does where he asks \"Could you repeat that?\" after every sentence. However, instead of interjecting, Dad instead then *waits for the full sentence to be repeated before speaking.* Same neuro-divergent tendency, same coping mechanism to buy time, **but not rude.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>He might not be pretending to not know what he's talking about. He might actually not realize it. This is very typical of people who are neuro-divergent.\n\nThis might be fine *if OP had not repeatedly brought this up to Dad*. It's one thing for something to be truly beyond control. Fair enough. It's another for a behavior to be literally unnoticed. Can't blame someone for a problem they doesn't know exists, I agree. But neither of those are what is happening here.\n\nIf you are unaware of a personal behavior, but then you are *repeatedly informed* you are engaging in said behavior, then is no longer ignorance,  that is *willful ignorance*. And *willful* ignorance is *not* okay behavior.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I'm reluctant to call someone an asshole at all if they aren't aware of a medical condition causing an issue.\n\nYou don't need to be aware of a medical condition to know that interrupting others is rude. **I need coping strategies for a lot of things, but I have never needed one for respecting others.**", "OP is asking if she is the AH not for a diagnosis or information. I am not either.", "Fine.  he's testing his dad who possibly has a disability.

We\u2019re pretty confident at this point that he grew up with untreated ADHD (just the times) and this is just his auditory process. It has NEVER improved. I admit that these days I usually wait for him to ask twice before repeating cuz I like being married and that helps me not want to choke him instead of just getting interrupted over and over.

Your dad may have an issue with auditory processing, but that also doesn't mean you are obligated to constantly repeat yourself.", "Thank you for pointing this out, I have ADHD with particular difficulty processing auditory information. I'm really prone to asking someone to repeat themselves before my brain catches up and I start responding, which often means I end up talking over them until I can catch myself.", "So she paused to let him process?

I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019ll process it upon repetition!\n\nBe patient with your dad, OP, if you can, but talk to some other family members about this too.

Seriously?", "As a people pleaser with ADHD I actually even considered that perhaps the motivation for his interuption is that he feels bad he made them repeat and trying to stop it to save them the work cause hes finally processed what they originally said. It doesn't make it not a rude thing to do, but doesn't presume hes trying to act like an asshole. \n\nIf they can now have an adult conversation about how its likely his brain just needs that extra time to process the auditory question, that they can maturely work on communicating in a way that works for both of them.", "Hahaha see my reply to the same comment because I didn't read yours first. My ADHD brain straight away went to \"maybe he thinks he's saving them from continuing to repeat when he interupts!\"", "I actually think this too.
