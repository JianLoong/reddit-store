Here is the situation, I (22F) got invited to coffee with a guy (24M) but all coffee shops were closed in our area so we opted to do dinner instead. This was our first time meeting in person.\n\nWe went to order our food, off the bat, he ordered for me. I then, asked to only get the main course and not the sides. He suggested he'd eat the sides off my plate (which he ordered for me) in addition to what he was getting. Cost him more so idk. He offered to pay which I am always grateful for because it's always nice when another person pays for your meal. We then sit down and here is the part that did it: there were bathroom napkins (the long rectangular recycled rough ones) on the table, I imagine the place ran out of the normal ones but that's what our table had. We sit down and he proceeds to grab on and begins blowing his nose. by blowing I mean BLOWING, for honestly a solid minute. He would make eye contact between blows. It was so loud that people began turning towards us. I know it sounds like I am being rude or maybe picky but I am not used to this public display of behavior. Then he grabbed another and twisted it and put it up his nostrils and blew again.\n\nI sat there in shock like didn't those napkins hurt his nose, and I kept looking around for cameras to see if I was being pranked, I did not know what to do so I just awkwardly smiled. He did not go wash his hands after. It was shocking to see as he comes from upper middle-class, I don't come from a wealthy family but I was always taught to show your best appearance in public and basic hygiene practices like washing your hands.\n\nThe remainder of the dinner I could not get the image out of my head so I practically spaced out. He thought the dinner went great and was really excited to have met me, he kept going on about spending more time with me in the future. We agreed to message about planning to meet again for movie or dinner (we had no solid plans in line), but I did not follow through with messaging and blocked him. I told my friends of this and they thought I was rude for not messaging him instead of straight up blocking. I have no issue with blowing your nose but so dramatically?? on the first time meeting someone?? in a public setting?

He demanded you order how he wanted and would take your food bc he wanted them\u2026and you\u2019re more worried about him blowing his nose? Lol. Nta but you\u2019re missing the red flags for the trees.", "NTA and here\u2019s why\u2026 if he\u2019s comfortable doing this in a restaurant like that especially on a first date.. he will be even more rude and inconsiderate in the future. A nose wipe fine.. but what you described ?? In a restaurant around other diners? Go to the fing bathroom. You know what else makes him an AH? Ordering for you. Huge AH. Are you eating the meal AH? You don\u2019t owe him an explanation\u2026 he\u2019s not entitled to that because you shared a dinner\u2026 although next time anyone ever attempts to tell you what you\u2019re going to eat do NOT allow it. Id have walked out just over that.", "NTA\n\nWhy are all these people talking as if ghosting is illegal? You went on one date, you don\u2019t owe a person anything after.", "NTA. Ok, gross. People who blow their noses at the table/eating establishments are disgusting, go do that in the bathroom already.  And, he ordered for you, ghost away.", "NTA. You don\u2019t have to explain yourself to someone you just met. The nose blowing sounds awful, but the fact he ordered for you *shudder*\nI get what people are saying about ghosting being mean, but it was one date. He should be able to just move on without being butthurt about it.", "NTA. If it's a first date, the least he could have done was blow his nose in private and wash his hands. Making eye contact while doing it too? Eww. I remember going to a nice sushi restaurant and a guy took one of the cloth napkins on the table and loudly blew his nose into it and then left it there for the staff to pick up. So inconsiderate and rude.", "NTA / hygiene is very telling and consideration of others is important too. You aborted timely.", "NTA/ESH\n\nsomeone ignoring basic hygiene and decorum is an extremely valid reason to stop going out with someone (not that you need  reason at all)\n\nhe should have excused himself and gone to the restroom when he felt the need to blow his nose.\n\nthat being said, i find \"ghosting\" somewhat cruel in the case where you don't respond simply because you dislike someone. at the very least, explain why you would like to cut off contact with them beforehand.\n(obvs diff if you feel unsafe tho)\n\nalso he has several red flags just from this alone, so I'm glad you got out of there while you could easily do so", "YTA for ghosting. If he didn\u2019t give a good first impression that\u2019s your right to not want to see him again but ghosting someone is always a dick move especially after making plans. At least say you\u2019re not interested", "YTA. People are people and deserve basic respect. You don't have to go out with him, but you can at least have the decency to tell him it's not going to work.", "NTA and YTA\nNot the AH for not wanting to go out again with him after how he behaved, we all have our standards and i understand perfectly if you dont want to meet him again.\nYTA for blocking and not telling him up front you dont want to go out again with him because you didnt felt a connection or whatever way you want to justify it, if you even want to justify yourself. If he acts childish after that then block him", "Oh the horror!  How did you ever make it out alive?\n\nYTA.", "ESH; everyone was rude all around in some way. \n\n\\-He should have a better concept of hygiene and etiquette \n\n\\-Ghosting instead of communicating there will be no 2nd date instead of immediately blocking when he inquired about future plans.", "YTA \n\nGhosting is mean", "YTA - for ghosting. He didn't do anything that warrants that.", "YTA - and to be honest, immature. It\u2019s completely ok to not want a second date. It\u2019s not ok to ghost someone. If you\u2019re mature enough to date, you should be mature enough to communicate and say; \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re a good match.\u201d \nOf course if he was abusive or something like that then ok, I understand ghosting. But he wasn\u2019t.", "You should have been honest with him.\n\nYTA for that.", "YTA  \n\n\nblowing noses is something people do and it can prevent the snot from drpping out of the nose all over his face.  \n\n\nif you think that is hygenic.......  welll it really is not but next time you go on a date with someone you need to let them know that blowing noses affects you so negativley, perhaps they will be willing to step aside so as not to offend you", "Soft YTA. It would have been more reasonable to be upset at the whole ordering for you thing lol. \n\nBut maybe the nose blowing situation could have been handled with some communication. Some people are a little obtuse on social situations, even if just sometimes, and just a, \u201chey would you do that in the restroom?\u201d Or, \u201ccould you wash your hands? You just blew your nose, and we\u2019re about to eat,\u201d would work. Either he would be polite and comply or he\u2019d get all defensive, which would be a great excuse to walk away, on top of the other thing.\n\n\nBig YTA:\n\nAs for ghosting- I don\u2019t think it was warranted at all here. You could have at least sent a message explaining why you didn\u2019t want to go on a second date with the guy, instead of making him believe you were interested by talking to him about setting up that second date before ghosting. That\u2019s just cruel.", "[deleted]", "ESH. Terrible manners by him, but how hard is it say \"sorry, didn't feel a spark\"?", "YTA.\n\nNot for not wanting to date him, that\u2019s fair. The ordering thing would have been a no for me. And then the nose blowing? I have allergies and I get maybe having to wipe your nose but if you need to blow it like that in public? Go to the washroom. Especially on a first date. But honestly, the ordering for you is red flag enough.\n\nBUT, ghosting is never okay, except in the most extreme of cases (aka when it\u2019s the safest option). You could have just messaged him saying that you didn\u2019t think you were a good fit and didn\u2019t want to bother with a second date. And then block him if he gave you a hard time.", "YTA for the ghosting issue but I can see your point", "I think YTA for fully ghosting him. I also would not go on another after all that (the blowing his nose not even being the worst of it) but I feel like you should have at least explained first. I\u2019d want to know what I did wrong.\n\nEven if you just sent a paragraph explaining and then blocking before he replied, that would be fine. But just ghosting after he thought it went so well seems unnecessarily cruel to do, to me at least", "I find it totally disgusting when someone blows their nose in the presence of other people whether in public, work or home.  It is a nasty bodily function.  Go to the bathroom or somewhere private.  Might as well wipe your ass at the dinner table...", "NTA. The ordering for you is pretty cringey, the nose blowing just sealed his fate.", "He deserves better than a girl who would judge him on one thing like that. Boys are gross sometimes! The ones who aren't probably had some nice gf who trained him better. Lol. You should have said, \" if you promise not to blow your nose at the table and wash your hands after, I'm willing to give it a second chance. What if he is perfect in every other way with one flaw that no one has ever said anything to him about?!", "First he ordered for you.  Did he know what you wanted?  The only people who should be ordering for someone else is a parent for their child.   As for the nose blowing, that's absolutely disgusting.  The proper thing to do would've been to go to the bathroom to clean his nose, not at the table where you're about to eat dinner.  It's one thing if it was just a quick blow & wipe, but the way you described it, it shouldn't have been done in public.  Especially the sticking it up his nose & then not washing.  This sounds like it may not have been a great date.  YTA for blocking him & not telling him that you don't want to see him again.  How would you feel if you were blocked & had no idea why?", "NTA, but don't ghost people, give honest straightforward rejection and then do the blocking and such.  Also, I find it really weird that him controlling your order is not the focus, but he was obviously trying to test your boundaries from the get-go, to see if you would call him out or push back or question what he was doing.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

A man who was less oblivious to social cues and polite behavior would have let you order your own food and picked up on your cues that you were grossed out by his behavior and not enthusiastic about the date, and wouldn\u2019t have asked you out again anyway. \n\nIn a perfect world would everyone give precise and clear rejections that are received with ease and grace? Sure. But we don\u2019t live in that world. Men who are this rude and clueless are often aggressive and unpredictable when rejected and there\u2019s nothing wrong with choosing to keep yourself protected and simply ghosting.

Obviously the biggest red flag was ordering for you, it's weird that 20 year old's are doing this like it's the 1940's.  I get that sometimes you just gotta blow the nose but at least say \"excuse me\" and head to the restroom to take care of your business.  Sounds like you dodged a bullet.", "NTA But honestly I would have been more upset about him ordering for me.  And wanting to eat off my plate. The nose blowing was just the icing on the cake.", "Yes I recognize that was a red flag but I did not know what to do other than agree. What do you suggest I should've done at that point", "Yes - this is the issue- A virtual stranger deciding he knows better than what you, an adult, wants for dinner and then being weird about sides was a bigger warning.   \n\nThat said whilst you had absolutely no obligation to see him again for whatever reason, and maybe blowing a nose too a bit of an odd reason,  I think ghosting is a bit assholey.   A \u2018thanks for dinner but i didn\u2019t feel a connection\u2019 would be enough/ and you don\u2019t owe any more than that.   But then I\u2019ve also seen how much of an agrressige dick rejected men can be, so maybe NTA if you got that vibe.", "I think that way of ordering sounds reasonable.
