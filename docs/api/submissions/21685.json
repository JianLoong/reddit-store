I'm not threatened by them and really am just happy for her to have them as friends. But I personally fucking hate this one guy she's known for decades. He's pretty unintelligent, somewhat of a liberal conspiracy theorist (I'm a liberal too, but I'm grounded in reality), and talking to him is so boring. I've tried many times to be nice and find something, anything that is redeeming about him. But I can't and he makes my blood boil. He's not a bad guy, but he sucks. He just sucks so much. And I don't want to spend time with him because he gets me so agitated. She is more than free to see him and his wife as much, every day, I don't give a shit. But for the love of god, I don't.\n\nHe is very frequently inconsiderate, ungrateful and in all reality takes advantage of my wife - since we've moved out of the city to the suburbs near him, he and his wife ask to hang out every other weekend, because no one else lives out here and (i think) they see it as a chance to get our city friends to travel. When he invites us over, he orders food and then asks us to split it (we didn't exactly ask for him to order, he just does). One time he stayed with us while on vacation and asked me not to deflate their bed taking up our entire living room during the day (I was also forced to lock my cat in the basement for 3 days because of his allergies). One time when my wife and I were living out of state for really high-pressure jobs, he asked to drop his dog off at our place on our only day off so he could buy weed in a cheaper state near us- my wife is too nice to say no (he didn't bring us back any weed either or a gentlemen's $50). \n\nI am big on social etiquette - I'm somewhat of a larry david type - and when people don't have any, it gets to me.My wife is pissed cause I expressed my displeasure with him recently and said \"l'm not telling you not to see him. I'm telling you i don't want to see him. If there's like an event or something, whatever. But weekend hangs, no thanks. You go, I'll hang with the pets.\" \n\nShe thinks I'm being rude and worries my actions will push him away and ruin their friendship. I think that's kind of bullshit, because if that's the case, he's not a good friend. She also thinks I'm trying to control her, which is again, bullshit.

You're not saying your wife has to stop seeing him, so I don't see the issue.  You seem very reasonable, and unless you are leaving out details, I don't see you being controlling.", "NTA.  Your perspective on his behavior is just that - your perspective, and its accuracy is completely beside the point.  You may be being a pissy prick about these things, it\u2019s impossible for us to tell since we only have your side of the story, but once again - beside the point.\n\nIf you don\u2019t like the guy, you don\u2019t like him, and that\u2019s okay.  Declining to hang out with someone you don\u2019t like isn\u2019t being controlling, it\u2019s just refusing to be pushed into being around people you don\u2019t want to be around.  It would be one thing if you were trying to stop your wife from seeing him.  If you\u2019re not, your wife just needs to get over it - not everybody in your life is going to like each other.", "I can\u2019t really weigh in on whether or not his actions are bad because there\u2019s not enough context for the most part. In regards to the situation with your cat and the basement that\u2019s certainly a messy situation for your cat and for him because he can\u2019t fix having allergies.\n\nIn regards to not being around him that doesn\u2019t make you an asshole because you\u2019re not required to be friends with everyone your partner is friends with. \n\nNTA", "NTA you have every right to not want to see him. TBH sounds like he doesn\u2019t even know he\u2019s being inconsiderate.", "NTA.\n\nYou don't have to like all of your partners friends, and its totally fine to not want to hang out with them.  I know plenty of women who have no desire to hang out with some of their boyfriend/husband's friends.   It doesn't even matter if its because he is inconsiderate.  You are allowed to just not click with people.", "NTA\n\nYou're not trying to control what your wife does - you're just stating that you don't want to hang.", "nta, idk why ur wife needs u to also be friends with him to maintain her friendship.\ngood luck!", "NTA and I absolutely love that you\u2019re so secure!  This is the way", "NTA - but just a thought that maybe your wife needs some support and help seeing its okay to say \"no\" being a people pleaser is exhausting (imo) maybe she doesn't know how to say no without confrontation or maybe she knows that friend will be confrontational if she says no. Have you ever offered to say no for her? I know it shouldn't be your job but we have to support our spouses and speaking up for them when they need us to is part of that.", "NTA. You are not teling your wife if she can or which Who she can hang out, you are only said what you are gonna do, thats Its not she that Guy. \nYou dont like his friend, you dont need to hang out with him.\nSimple as that. \nI dont see the problem.", "NTA\n\nLook, If it\u2019s just this one guy then it\u2019s the one guy. If you\u2019re not finding reasons to not hang out with all of her friends then this is perfectly reasonable. The guy just sucks. It would be a problem if my fianc\u00e9e didn\u2019t want to hang out with none of my friends but if one of them rubs her the wrong way then fine. \n\nI guess you need to decide if the juice is worth the squeeze here. This other couple is going to start asking questions as to why you are never around anymore and there are only going to be so many excuses your wife can make before they figure it out or she has to have a really awkward conversation with this couple that will probably ruin the friendship. My guess is your wife is dreading having to go through this moving forward with the excuses or hard conversation and would prefer you suffer through this guy sometimes. \n\nIDK. Maybe cut back on how much you hang out with this dude and maybe throw your wife some cover here and there and just do it?", "NTA. Great that you provided examples of their actions, but if you don\u2019t *like* someone\u2026 **you don\u2019t like them** and are not beholden to hang out with them, wife or no wife. \n\nJust because you\u2019re married, doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t have different friends and interests. I don\u2019t join in on my husband\u2019s activities / friends that I have no interest or connection with, nor do I take offence if he skips out on my time with friends. Forced couples activities are stressful and lead to consistent expectations (it *has* to be the four of us) and resentment. \n\nIf you have to\u2026Do you enjoy chatting with his wife on couples night? Maybe lean into that, rather than focusing on him?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

BUT, with the proximity and them asking to hang every other weekend, you are definitely NTA for asking to be left out of the equation. However please be honest with yourself and your wife. Do you actually want her to decline some of the invites and stay with you instead? If so, you have to tell her. I can imagine these get togethers are not only grating for you but also cut into the time you have with your wife, which is important for your relationship. She may be thinking if you came it would be a fun night and you\u2019d also be together. If you truly don\u2019t care that she goes, you should reassure her that the other weekends with her are more than enough for you and she should have fun with your friends.

If you just say \u201cfine go with them, I guess I\u2019ll just sit here by myself with the dogs\u201d, then she\u2019s sure to feel conflicted about it and if she limits time with him fit that reason, she\u2019ll come to resent you for it. Bottom line, be very clear if you really want her to hang out with them all the time or if you wish she would limit it to once a month. And maybe you might feel gracious enough to accompany her every other month.", "NTA\n\nYou two are not a single unit that cannot be apart for a few hours.

If they are true friends, he will understand that not everyone loves each other's partners.\n\nI am sure she is also concerned that she will feel like a 3rd wheel.
