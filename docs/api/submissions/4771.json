The boys rooms and their gaming room.\n\nWhen Nate and Mia moved in with us Nate took my office as his bedroom and Mia took Nate's childhood bedroom. She was very excited to have a whole floor to herself. After a while she asked us if she could take the other two rooms as well since no one is using them. I figured there is no need to leave the rooms empty so I let her turn them into her own gaming room and a room that she calls her hobby room.\n\nWe had no problem with this arrangement these last 7 years until now. \n\nSeth called me and asked if he, his wife and Riley could stay with us for a few months because of some financial probelms. There was no way we could empty 2 rooms for them because we didn't have any space to put Mia's stuff in it. Finally I asked her to just empty one of the rooms for them. She wasn't happy about it but she agreed.\n\nThey arrived yesterday and Seth asked me which room is Riley's. I told him that they all should stay in his childhood room. He asked me if I seriously expect them to share a bedroom with their teenage son? I told him we only have one empty room so that's what they have to do. He started yelling at me and said it's ridiculous that Mia has 2 rooms to herself while Riley doesn't have any. I got angry and told him Riley has a bedroom, he and his wife are the ones without a bedroom and they can sleep on the couch if they want. He called me an asshole and said I'm letting Nate and Mia live with me rent free for years and give them a luxury life but I can't give him a place to stay for a few months. I reminded him that they are here helping us it would be ridiculous to ask them to pay rent and by the way Seth himself isn't going to pay any rent either.

Are you sure you want to go forward with this arrangement? It's already tense, and they just got there.\n\nInfo: How big is Mia's bedroom? There's absolutely nowhere else her hobby/game stuff can go? Also, are you sure they'll only be there a couple of months? \n\nOn the one hand, they should be grateful they have a place to go. On the other hand, no, it's not reasonable to have to sleep in the same room as your teenager.", "YTA. You can find a way to better accommodate both of your grand children without giving one 2 bedrooms and another 0. If you were saying no to that it should have been said upfront, before they arrived, bc it is a bit shocking. Your grandson must think you really dislike him about now.", "Weird to me that you let a kid take over 3 rooms. And weirder that you honestly think it\u2019s reasonable to put 3 people in one room.\n\nYTA", "Parents sharing with a teenager for a couple nights would be awkward but doable. Sharing for months is not feasible. ESH You because how could you even think that would work?  And all of you for not communicating well before hand. So are there any other options? Is there room to divide the living room or a dining room space you don't use? A basement? Can you clear out the other room Mia uses and put her things in a storage unit? Maybe your son should pay for that. In fact where is all Riley's family's stuff from where they used to live? Do they have storage that Mia's extra stuff could go in temporarily? It is hard on her but maybe you can all find ways to make it up to her. Families do sacrifice for each other and let's hope its only a couple months.", "ESH.\n\nThe expectations should have been outlined before move in.\n\nI don't see how anyone expected a teenage boy to share with his two parents when there was a room as good as any available. \n\nMia, while it's great she has the space to do with as she pleases, doesn't *need* two rooms to live comfortably. At most, letting Riley use one of the rooms is an inconvenience to Mia and would be an adjustment for everyone.\n\nSeth's reaction was less than kind, polite, and grateful. No argument there.  \n\nBut I don't understand how you thought this was going to go down well. I feel bad for your grandson seeing as it's not his fault his parents fell on difficult times, had to uproot his life, and move in to a house where his cousin gets two rooms to herself while he has to share with his parents for months (ick).  \n\nYes, you're doing a good thing by helping them out, and it's great Nate offered to help with your wife, but Riley is your family too and (I believe) should be offered similar courtesies as Mia.", "ESH. Mia can live with 1 room for a little bit. She\u2019s lucky to have a room to herself.  When my parents took in relatives when I was a kid I slept on the couch. A spare room definitely wouldnt have been kept as a gaming room. As others have said Seth can pay for storage for her things until they move out again. Seth shouldn\u2019t said anything about Nate though", "ESH. He shouldn't have blown up on you, but he's right. You absolutely should make space for a bed in the extra room. Mia will be ok.", "I was YTA but once Seth started yelling and saying you\u2019re ridiculous, when he\u2019s a 37 year old having to move in with his parents and complaining at the hospitality. \n\nHowever, if he\u2019d have settled and then said. Hey this isn\u2019t ideal. Can one of us sleep in mias room? \n\nBut yta as I do find it shocking that Mia begrudgingly emptied one of her rooms, she lives with you, why has she been allowed to take monopoly of the house? \n\nWhy have 3 adults agreed to let a child clutter 3 rooms and take a floor to herself.", "Mild YTA. Mia's ~~gaming or hobby~~ second room can be used as a bedroom if this is temporary. I think Seth's reaction is a bit much, but yes, a 17 year old needs his space, and it's not like it's not there. Does the room have to be completely emptied? I know it's a disruption for Mia, but it is temporary (or at least it should be). It's not like she's being kicked out of her bedroom.", "ESH.\n\nI'm feeling resentment towards Seth because he didn't offer to come and help with his mother.\n\nSeth just assumed he would have two rooms available. This is somehting that should have been discussed before they got here. \n\nBut I don't get how you didn't think of putting a bed in the other room or how you though that your son, his wife and their kid sharing a bedroom for weeks or months was a good idea.\n\nYou guys are a family. You could have sit down and find a solution together.", "INFO: Given that you guys are close, could you have an adult conversation with Mia about temporarily offering up her space? It feels like she may be old enough to appreciate the scenario.\n\nWhile I appreciate that everyone currently living there is comfortable as is, asking parents and a 17 year old boy to share a room feels awkward. I know you are doing them a favor. I also understand why they thought there would be enough space.", "Yta.  I agree it doesn\u2019t make sense for 2 rooms to be empty.  But they are now needed for other people.  A 17 year old kid needs privacy as does a married couple.", "ESH. You for thinking it's cool that Mia needs a dedicated gaming room when a married couple with their teenage son show up and you technically do have 2 rooms to spare, and your son for pretending that you let live Mia and Nate \"rent free\" when the entire premise of them being there is to help you take care of your wife and their mother, respectively. Which is a horribly taxing job, to say the least.", "YTA. Mia doesn\u2019t need three rooms during this time when your other son and grandchild need a place to stay. Typical golden child stuff going on here.", "ESH this is a temporary arrangement. Riley can sleep on the couch or blowup in the gaming room or with his parents. Beggars can\u2019t be choosers. If they are too comfortable they will never leave. Nate is a caregiver for your wife and NOT living with you rent free.", "ESH\n\nIt makes no sense for an empty room while two adults with their nearly adult son are crowded in one. Just put a bed in the gaming room or move Mia's stuff to her parents room or the living room.\n\nSeth should not have called helping his disabled mother living rent free.", "YTA", "YTA. How much stuff can a 16 year old collect? Does she even use it all? Having a room empty which could have the boy in it is selfish, if it's a temporary living situation it wouldn't be hard to make enough room just for a single bed or stretcher to fit in the room. Mia does not need two rooms and needs to learn to be there for family, she still has her own bedroom and privacy. Your son shouldn't have yelled at you but I understand why, just put yourself in their shoes for a bit. It seems there is favoritism being shown here", "I don't understand why your grandson can't sleep in the game/hobby room on an air mattress or something similar.", "YTA\n\nTake your sons out of the situation, you are being extremely unfair to your grandson. His life has been uprooted and you are showing him you care more about your granddaughters stuff than him and his parents.\n\nYou son shouldn't have assume, however I can see why he did make the assumption that him and his son had more priory than a games room. Your not kicking Mia out of her actual bedroom. \n\nBox up the game room, ask seth to cover the cost of a storage unit and then put a bed in the room for your grandson. In a few months time Mia gets the space back, Mia might not like it, but I bet Riley is hating this situation even more, so maybe she should consider herself lucky that she isn't having her whole life uprooted and it's only rearranging her stuff for a short period of time.", "ESH\n\nHere's the deal.... And I can't believe I'm explaining this to someone that's likely over 60 years old. You don't take in a family (one that is YOUR KID) if you don't have the room for it. I'm 100% sure you and the rest of the adults in that house could have figured out where to keep Mia's things. If you have a house with 4-5 bedrooms, I'm sure there's either a basement, a garage, an attic, or a combination of all three. Bottom line, there's got to be something that could have been done to prevent Seth, DIL, and your ADULT GRANDSON from sharing a bedroom. I could understand if you didn't have enough bedrooms.... But you literally have 5 bedrooms and are using three..... That leaves 2. I only have one question..... What did Seth ever do to you???? \n\nSeth should have turned around and left as soon as he heard your \"accommodations\". He also shouldn't have said the things he said, but I can see why he would. His own father is basically forcing him to share a room with his wife and kid.", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re showing clear favouritism OP. Your granddaughter needs to move her stuff. If you\u2019re going to help your family then do it, don\u2019t half arse it. A 17 year old doesn\u2019t need three rooms. She can put her stuff in storage until your child and other grandchild move out.", "NTA, you have a family caregiver you have worked out a rent deal with.  You are being asked by your non care giver son to change that deal and you have set the terms.  Your house your life he can learn to deal with it.  Yes your one sons child has two additional rooms as part of the support she and her father provide to your wife.  \n\nYour other son is a huge asshole because the payment to your care giver son is the rooms he and his daughter occupy in return for care and his free loading ass is complaining because you aren\u2019t giving him enough when he is on hard times.  While your other son and grand daughter dropped everything in their lives to be a care support system for you.", "YTA. Its clear they are with you because they need the help. So why does grandkid get two bedrooms and the other one zero? Let her clean both of them out ffs its only temporary. Or at least put a bed in het other room so the boy can have some privacy. It looks more like favouritsm the way you are handling it now.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

When was the last time he was at your place?  Did he know how things were set up?  There was a distinct lack of communication with both of you.  For all he knew you moved your study upstairs and used another room for your 'hobby's' that take up the whole room and there's no where to put them.\n\nMia may be a little cranky but she sounds a little entitled too.  She has had free reign of the top floor but most kids don't have 3 rooms all to themselves.\n\nThe dedicated games room has to go.  Riley deserves a room to himself as you have one.  Move the games stuff to another room - maybe into the corner of one of the living areas.  Or move enough out so that you can fit a bed it in.  But Mia needs to get her things out as she won't be able to just go into that room whenever she wants.\n\nIf you didn't have two spare rooms then Riley would have to share with his parents (or in a tent in the backyard) but he's lucky the room is there. Mia has been very lucky to have had the space she has had but things have changed.\n\nYou also need to set some ground rules. You don't want to make things too cozy and Seth will never want to move out.  Also are Seth and his wife going to help with the care of your wife?  Maybe if they don't want to they need to contribute more to the household in other ways.  You probably need to split the bills 3 ways - you pay a third, Nate pays a third and Seth pays a third.  He's getting the best deal here with there being 3 of them but the rest of you are in pairs.  You can split that up more if you need to ie he pays 3/7th's of the utilities.  They will also need to do their own washing and buy their own food.  Cooking will need to be negotiated ie who can use the stove and when and how is cleaning going to work.  You may need a roster system.\n\nHow long is this meant to be for?  You may need to set a timeframe ie 3 months or 6 months.
