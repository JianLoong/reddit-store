Also, are you sure they'll only be there a couple of months? \n\nOn the one hand, they should be grateful they have a place to go. On the other hand, no, it's not reasonable to have to sleep in the same room as your teenager.", "YTA. You can find a way to better accommodate both of your grand children without giving one 2 bedrooms and another 0. If you were saying no to that it should have been said upfront, before they arrived, bc it is a bit shocking. Your grandson must think you really dislike him about now.", "Weird to me that you let a kid take over 3 rooms. And weirder that you honestly think it\u2019s reasonable to put 3 people in one room.\n\nYTA", "Parents sharing with a teenager for a couple nights would be awkward but doable. Sharing for months is not feasible. ESH You because how could you even think that would work?  And all of you for not communicating well before hand. So are there any other options? Is there room to divide the living room or a dining room space you don't use? A basement? Can you clear out the other room Mia uses and put her things in a storage unit? Maybe your son should pay for that. In fact where is all Riley's family's stuff from where they used to live? Do they have storage that Mia's extra stuff could go in temporarily? It is hard on her but maybe you can all find ways to make it up to her. Families do sacrifice for each other and let's hope its only a couple months.", "ESH.\n\nThe expectations should have been outlined before move in.\n\nI don't see how anyone expected a teenage boy to share with his two parents when there was a room as good as any available. \n\nMia, while it's great she has the space to do with as she pleases, doesn't *need* two rooms to live comfortably. At most, letting Riley use one of the rooms is an inconvenience to Mia and would be an adjustment for everyone.\n\nSeth's reaction was less than kind, polite, and grateful. No argument there.  \n\nBut I don't understand how you thought this was going to go down well. I feel bad for your grandson seeing as it's not his fault his parents fell on difficult times, had to uproot his life, and move in to a house where his cousin gets two rooms to herself while he has to share with his parents for months (ick).  \n\nYes, you're doing a good thing by helping them out, and it's great Nate offered to help with your wife, but Riley is your family too and (I believe) should be offered similar courtesies as Mia.", "ESH. Mia can live with 1 room for a little bit. She\u2019s lucky to have a room to herself.  When my parents took in relatives when I was a kid I slept on the couch. A spare room definitely wouldnt have been kept as a gaming room. As others have said Seth can pay for storage for her things until they move out again. Seth shouldn\u2019t said anything about Nate though", "ESH. He shouldn't have blown up on you, but he's right. You absolutely should make space for a bed in the extra room. Mia will be ok.", "I was YTA but once Seth started yelling and saying you\u2019re ridiculous, when he\u2019s a 37 year old having to move in with his parents and complaining at the hospitality. \n\nHowever, if he\u2019d have settled and then said. Hey this isn\u2019t ideal.

Mia's ~~gaming or hobby~~ second room can be used as a bedroom if this is temporary. I think Seth's reaction is a bit much, but yes, a 17 year old needs his space, and it's not like it's not there. Does the room have to be completely emptied? I know it's a disruption for Mia, but it is temporary (or at least it should be). It's not like she's being kicked out of her bedroom.", "ESH.\n\nI'm feeling resentment towards Seth because he didn't offer to come and help with his mother.\n\nSeth just assumed he would have two rooms available. This is somehting that should have been discussed before they got here. \n\nBut I don't get how you didn't think of putting a bed in the other room or how you though that your son, his wife and their kid sharing a bedroom for weeks or months was a good idea.\n\nYou guys are a family.

It feels like she may be old enough to appreciate the scenario.\n\nWhile I appreciate that everyone currently living there is comfortable as is, asking parents and a 17 year old boy to share a room feels awkward. I know you are doing them a favor. I also understand why they thought there would be enough space.", "Yta.  I agree it doesn\u2019t make sense for 2 rooms to be empty.  But they are now needed for other people.  A 17 year old kid needs privacy as does a married couple.", "ESH. You for thinking it's cool that Mia needs a dedicated gaming room when a married couple with their teenage son show up and you technically do have 2 rooms to spare, and your son for pretending that you let live Mia and Nate \"rent free\" when the entire premise of them being there is to help you take care of your wife and their mother, respectively. Which is a horribly taxing job, to say the least.", "YTA. Mia doesn\u2019t need three rooms during this time when your other son and grandchild need a place to stay. Typical golden child stuff going on here.", "ESH this is a temporary arrangement. Riley can sleep on the couch or blowup in the gaming room or with his parents. Beggars can\u2019t be choosers. If they are too comfortable they will never leave. Nate is a caregiver for your wife and NOT living with you rent free.", "ESH\n\nIt makes no sense for an empty room while two adults with their nearly adult son are crowded in one.

How much stuff can a 16 year old collect? Does she even use it all? Having a room empty which could have the boy in it is selfish, if it's a temporary living situation it wouldn't be hard to make enough room just for a single bed or stretcher to fit in the room. Mia does not need two rooms and needs to learn to be there for family, she still has her own bedroom and privacy. Your son shouldn't have yelled at you but I understand why, just put yourself in their shoes for a bit. It seems there is favoritism being shown here", "I don't understand why your grandson can't sleep in the game/hobby room on an air mattress or something similar.", "YTA\n\nTake your sons out of the situation, you are being extremely unfair to your grandson. His life has been uprooted and you are showing him you care more about your granddaughters stuff than him and his parents.\n\nYou son shouldn't have assume, however I can see why he did make the assumption that him and his son had more priory than a games room. Your not kicking Mia out of her actual bedroom. \n\nBox up the game room, ask seth to cover the cost of a storage unit and then put a bed in the room for your grandson. In a few months time Mia gets the space back, Mia might not like it, but I bet Riley is hating this situation even more, so maybe she should consider herself lucky that she isn't having her whole life uprooted and it's only rearranging her stuff for a short period of time.", "ESH\n\nHere's the deal.... And I can't believe I'm explaining this to someone that's likely over 60 years old. You don't take in a family (one that is YOUR KID) if you don't have the room for it. I'm 100% sure you and the rest of the adults in that house could have figured out where to keep Mia's things. If you have a house with 4-5 bedrooms, I'm sure there's either a basement, a garage, an attic, or a combination of all three. Bottom line, there's got to be something that could have been done to prevent Seth, DIL, and your ADULT GRANDSON from sharing a bedroom. I could understand if you didn't have enough bedrooms.... But you literally have 5 bedrooms and are using three..... That leaves 2. I only have one question..... What did Seth ever do to you???? \n\nSeth should have turned around and left as soon as he heard your \"accommodations\". He also shouldn't have said the things he said, but I can see why he would. His own father is basically forcing him to share a room with his wife and kid.", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re showing clear favouritism OP. Your granddaughter needs to move her stuff. If you\u2019re going to help your family then do it, don\u2019t half arse it. A 17 year old doesn\u2019t need three rooms. She can put her stuff in storage until your child and other grandchild move out.", "NTA, you have a family caregiver you have worked out a rent deal with.  You are being asked by your non care giver son to change that deal and you have set the terms.  Your house your life he can learn to deal with it.  Yes your one sons child has two additional rooms as part of the support she and her father provide to your wife.  \n\nYour other son is a huge asshole because the payment to your care giver son is the rooms he and his daughter occupy in return for care and his free loading ass is complaining because you aren\u2019t giving him enough when he is on hard times.  While your other son and grand daughter dropped everything in their lives to be a care support system for you.", "YTA. Its clear they are with you because they need the help. So why does grandkid get two bedrooms and the other one zero? Let her clean both of them out ffs its only temporary. Or at least put a bed in het other room so the boy can have some privacy.

She has had free reign of the top floor but most kids don't have 3 rooms all to themselves.\n\nThe dedicated games room has to go.  Riley deserves a room to himself as you have one.  Move the games stuff to another room - maybe into the corner of one of the living areas.  Or move enough out so that you can fit a bed it in.

You don't want to make things too cozy and Seth will never want to move out.  Also are Seth and his wife going to help with the care of your wife?  Maybe if they don't want to they need to contribute more to the household in other ways.  You probably need to split the bills 3 ways - you pay a third, Nate pays a third and Seth pays a third.  He's getting the best deal here with there being 3 of them but the rest of you are in pairs.  You can split that up more if you need to ie he pays 3/7th's of the utilities.  They will also need to do their own washing and buy their own food.  Cooking will need to be negotiated ie who can use the stove and when and how is cleaning going to work.

Short term, buy some bed risers or a frame that is 18\u201d high and eliminates a box spring, they have plenty of storage underneath and leave the piano in the other room - or buy a loft frame twin for the other room- try marketplace or Craigslist for great deals.\nRemember your grandson is watching the example you set and so far it\u2019s pretty poor, he being punished for his parents financial problems by his grandfather!", "ESH. Seth shouldn't have said those things, but Riley should get a room of his own. Think about how this will affect the cousin's feelings towards each other.

Others pointing out that Riley might feel some favoritism for Mia from you, I also can't disagree with. However, these issues all seem from the same place - you agreed to host a family you did not have space for, and you're upset that they're upset that there's no space for them.\n\nThis is only not an Everyone issue for me because no one but you and Seth seem to be pulling any clown shit on the side (Mia did make the move when you asked, Riley's discomfort is understandable).\n\nYTA", "Op.

It does seem excessive that she gets 3 rooms but the space was there at the time and no one else had an issue with her using the space. \n\nProblem is now you've offered your other son and his family a space to stay for a few months to help them out. You clearly didn't discuss this properly with them and they assumed that as your granddaughter has a bedroom of her own, the two 'spare rooms' would be available. It should have been made clear to them at the time you were out prepared to give them one room. \n\nCan a compromise be met? Getting a fold out bed for the craft room so your grandson can have a separate space to sleep from his parents. An agreement that she can still keep her things in there and get to them if she needs them. If the situation is they're only staying for a couple of months then everyone can work round that.\n\nPacking up all her things to give the grandson the whole room seems excessive in such a temporary situation and I can understand why that would upset her, but giving him a bed to sleep in away from his parents is also important when the space is there.

She still has two rooms.", "This. A considerate person wouldn\u2019t have even had to be asked, they would have offered.", "Don't forget she wasn't happy with having to give up one room. She's not a good person. If your mad to go from 3 rooms to 2.", "Yes, she only needs 1 room.", "Op is definitely AH. So is Mia.  Riley deserves to have space to himself.", "Y\u2019all are missing the point , the girls had the rooms for 7 years , she has the right to get upset . Even if she\u2019s happy for her cousin she still has the right to be upset about having to give up one of her rooms . Y\u2019all are making her out to be a brat when she\u2019s just a kid who had something and might not be able to have it anymore, it\u2019s literally kid behavior to be upset about stuff like that . And I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s actually a good thing for a teen to have more than one room bc if you do so much stuff in the room you sleep in or bed I think I\u2019ve heard it makes it hard to sleep .  I\u2019d put a bed in the room so the cousin can sleep but it\u2019s still her room and she was told it was her room and she\u2019s looked at it as her room for 7 years so I see where op is coming from that\u2019d it\u2019d be rude , but also I wouldn\u2019t ever make a teenager sleep with his parents . I would just put a bed or something in there op. Lay boundaries , like \u201cyou can put as much of your stuff as you want in here as long as it doesn\u2019t interfere with walking/the other stuff\u201d \u201cplease be careful of her things but as of right now this is your space so aside from her things you can do with it as you please\u201d so that they both feel like your trying to accommodate their needs.", "I am really interested about this, care is a full time job. This seems more like free loading", "Why do you assume it\u2019s bad financial choices? Especially in the current climate, it could easily be them both getting laid off unexpectedly like so many people. Also Nate didn\u2019t give up much, he gets all his expenses paid off and keeps his apparently big salary intact. Care is a full time job yet he is still working so he is only helping in his spare time, that\u2019s a sweet deal.", "Yeah, and he magically knew that a random person on reddit is a first generation American with Hispanic immigrant parents and he wanted to be racist just to spite you. \n\nFirst of all, the grandaughter had 3 rooms and she wasn\u2019t happy she had to give up even one, which belonged to his uncle in the first place. She doesn\u2019t need 2 rooms, first of all, second of all everyone can help cleaning the rooms. Is Not like all furniture needs to go out and the whole room to remain empty. She just needs to take out the stuff she needs, uses and doesn\u2019t want other people to touch. And considering she has things split in 3 rooms I don\u2019t think there are that many. She needs many rooms unlike her cousin who doesn\u2019t deserve one.", "Nate is helping us not the other way around\n\nThe kids and grankids don't get along. It would be nice if he did but he doesn't want to and has no obligation to help his brother", "That makes me wonder if Mia even lived there full time. But she's apparently grandpas princess and she can't be upset.", "Of course they are family. My siblings are also my family but they are only guests when they come over. So is my son", "Right?! It almost feels like he's doing it so they feel so uncomfortable they get out asap.", "I'd be curious to know the dimensions of the rooms. We had a three bed room apartment, my son had the two smallest rooms, bed room with absolutely no toys in it and a playroom where all the toys and whatnot were kept. That play room, if emptied would only have fit a single bed (tightly) and a bureau. Not ever spare rooms are decent size.", "It was \"her\" room. I think it was really nice of her to give up her comfort for her family", "I said \"second second\" meaning to keep the absurd concept of a second bedroom and show that she is doubly absurd.", "Agreed", "She isn't giving up the second room, that's the whole issue. OP is planning to allow her to keep the room to herself with her stuff and make his grandson suffer.\n\nHe said in another comment that there isn't enough room for a bed for the grandson and all her stuff, so he isn't allowing his grandson to use the room at all.\n\nHis grandson has to spend the next few months either living in a small room with his parents or someone has to sleep in the communal livingroom, whilst she gets to have two bedrooms because she is grandad golden child. She can be upset, but she should be told that situation have changed and for a temporary period of time the room will be used by her cousin. Which is what the other person who shares ownship of the house - aka his wife, wants to do.", "She isn\u2019t a kid tho she\u2019s almost 18 she can live not having 3 rooms for a couple of months. She is being a brat and even then they can just put a bed in the second room as a bare minimum, so what she\u2019s not used to having only 1 room as I said before she\u2019s almost 18 a adult she should know a pretty important thing called sharing", "Holy crap it was a joke not a d*ck don't take it so hard bro", "You have a warped definition of \u201cneeds\u201d.  Just admit that you favor Nate and Mia, and you dislike Seth and his family.  Accept the judgment and try and be better. Or not, and remain the AH.", "No, she does not \u201cneed\u201d that room. Riley does as Riley is lacking his own personal space entirely. Riley\u2019s need is greater as his is an actual need.", "Yta \n\nHis life is already disrupted. What your grandson is experiencing is alienation from his grand parents. \n\nClearly Mia is the favourite and you guys are making it know how it\u2019s inconveniencing you all to have them there, why not just say no. \n\nshe should have compassion enough to share for a FEW months. This poor kid is getting moved around and his whole life has changed. Be a bit more compassionate.", "YTA YTA YTA and you claim your wife has favorites we\u2019ll guess what so do you. A teen girl doesn\u2019t need 2 rooms let alone 3 in the first place, that\u2019s ridiculous! And you won\u2019t inconvenience your precious Mia because she lives there and one room just isn\u2019t enough for her majesty, but you\u2019re perfectly fine with your teen grandson cramming in a single room with his parents when there are options. You have a favorite and it\u2019s very obvious to everyone here.", "Storage units exist.", "Just like you favor you granddaughter.  When your son offer to move in to help with his mom. Was he having money problems as well.", "Favors or wants you to treat them fairly?", "I have my doubts about this, unless that has been provoked by your favouring Nate and Mia. Honestly dude, you are more concerned about Mia \u201cneeding\u201d space for her games and hobbies than about Riley - A TEEN BOY - ACTUALLY NEEDING personal space at all.\nYour comments reek of favouritism to the point that I\u2019m looking for a clothespin to put on my nose.", "Well someone needs to love them too. Jesus.", "I wonder why they don't get along?!", "How are you this tone deaf? The \"kids don't get along\" yea maybe because you have played favorites their whole lives. And \"nate is helping us\", how does he do his high paying job and act as a caregiver? I don't know many full time caregivers who can also have a second full time job. What does Nate do all day? What does Nate do to \"help\"?", "You are on here asking if you are TA, Yet try to make excuses with everyone calling you out on being one. Accept the judgement and fix the problem instead of trying to talk your way out of it. Every comment you post makes you an even bigger AH.", "Careful. You are moving quickly towards losing a grandson. His grandmother may not be happy with you when he no longer visits. Showing such blatant favoritism is an easy way to pare down family gatherings.", "You say they are \u201cguests\u201d so wouldn\u2019t it make sense to accommodate your guests? No teenager needs 2 rooms. Youve raised a brat & are just making pathetic excuses.", "I hope you're not expecting them to chip in with household bills and chores then. They're either guests or housemates, they can't be both.", "Yeah except they\u2019re not just visiting they\u2019ll be living with you now, no?", "Your grandson is probably going through a lot. A LOT. To be at that age, and having to move out of your home, and into a full house as it is. Give the poor kid a freaking room. Your granddaughter does not need multiple rooms when your grandson is also staying with you. It's absolutely ridiculous that you are arguing this. It really is.", "Same. Our kids rooms are tiny. One is 10x10 and the other is 9x9. The 9x9 room fits a twin bed, a tiny bookshelf, and nothing else. Which is fine. They are just for sleep. But if it had a gaming setup in it there would be no room for a bed.", "Nah, she did the bare minimum of what was required of her.  A nice and generous person would not insist on multiple rooms to themselves when others have no room.  Not to mention how disrespectful both of you are being to your wife.  Your wife wants Riley to have his own room.  My husband would NEVER disregard my opinion for anyone else.", "Her \u201ccomfort\u201d is multiple rooms and she\u2019s upset to give that up when there are people in need. That does not fit the definition of considerate. Considerate would be offering to give up the multiple rooms without being asked.", "I\u2019m pretty sure Riley and his parents would be giving up a lot more of their comfort by risking a teenage boy waking up with morning wood in the same room as his parents", "She has 3. You didn't ask her to sleep on the couch to help.", "Nice? It\u2019s your house. In no world does a child NEED this many rooms.", "Oh I missed that! I think my brain just thought it was a duplicate word!", "Yes it is called sharing but even now I\u2019m 19 and if I\u2019m eating a damn butterfinger or something and my boyfriend asks for some when I\u2019m on my time of the month? I get so mad/mean. She\u2019s not a brat she\u2019s a hormonal teenage girl who op never even said said \u201cno he can not have my room\u201d just said she wasn\u2019t happy about it WHICH IS NORMAL . IF YOU HAVE TO GIVE UP SOMETHING FOR SOMEONE ELSE YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE UPSET, even if you don\u2019t show it  idgaf what nobody else says .", "Yeah, accusing someone of racism is a very good joke. I laughed so hard.\n\nIf it really was a joke it\u2019s even worse as it\u2019s based on stereotypes and that\u2019s truly racist.", "A wonderful suggestion", "Not everyone can afford one", "It is because of favoritism but not the one that you think. My wife and I favored Seth a lot because Nate was a very difficult kid and teenager which caused issues between the boys and then between their kids. I deeply regret that now.\n\nWe havs different working hours so we both work and take care of my wife", "Exactly what I was thinking.", "Yes I get that but there\u2019s a clear cut line between food which is daily necessity and a gaming room, a hobby room and a bedroom. Also I used to live with my 2 siblings and shared a room with one and every single time I was asked to give my room to the guest did I complain no I let them have it no matter how angry I was because they needed it more then I did", "As a Hispanic I really don't care if someone tells me to mow lawns. I know I am better than they are. You need to lighten up and stop being so offended.", ">Wtf are you here for? Stirring the pot?\n\nPot calling the pestle black. Or is that racist too?", "But can you not see that you're now favouring Mia over Riley and potentially history is repeating itself??", "So in attempts to make you feel less guiltily, your doing exactly the same thing again, just this time in favour of Nate and his daughter?\n\nSo it didn't work out well for you the first time you showed poor parenting choices and you deeply regret this. So now instead of learning from your mistakes, you are defending your actions of not treating your grandchildren equally or with the same level of care and love, by showing the same favoritism to Mia that you showed Seth all those years ago?\n\nHow do you think this is going to end well?", "I did too when someone needed my room but it\u2019s y\u2019all raising kids to be conceited and spoiled then getting mad when they are . Yk how many TikTok\u2019s and stuff I\u2019ve seen about parents not making their kids share anymore bc it\u2019s their kids stuff ? Bc I have a lotttt. It\u2019s ridiculous but it\u2019s how tf the parents are raising their kids tbh . And I still haven\u2019t seen where op granddaughter said she wouldn\u2019t give up the room, it seems like it\u2019s op not wanting to give it up for her so you can\u2019t really blame her .", "I don\u2019t think mowing lawns is a hispanic stereotype, more like a teenager thing, proved by the fact that he said \u201cWalked to school without shoes\u201d, but you said he was racist because he mocked you when he didn\u2019t even know that you are hispanic. \n\nIt\u2019s ok to call people racist, but when they really are. Especially nowadays with all the fighting against racism, calling someone racist for no reason doesn\u2019t seem a good idea, even more that in this context and without intonation(as it\u2019s in text) you can\u2019t tell if it is a joke or not.", "You seem so blind!!", "I'm not. I wasn't joking when I said the room is Riley's my son and sil are free to sleep on the couch"]}
