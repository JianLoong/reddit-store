In fact using scrubbing pads on some surfaces can actually reduce the effectiveness of coatings and can potentially result in exposing porous surfaces and may even lead to future food contamination issues.  That said there\u2019s times when the soak will not help and scrubbing is necessary.  It\u2019s still smarter to attempt the soaking method first before resorting to harsh abrasive methods of cleaning.\n\nThere\u2019s also the potential for repetitive strain and even potential permanent damage to the hands, arms, shoulders back and neck from vigorous scrubbing.  I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to find out you have osteoarthritis in any on of these areas as a result of abusing your body beyond its ability to heal, and it would be because of your impatience with cleaning at a practical energy-saving pace and preference for fast results.\n\nIn short YTA.

It seems like it should be a group task.\n\nAnd imagine it the other way round - if the mother was visiting the daughter, and the daughter called the mother lazy for doing something not quite how she wanted it done, that would be appalling.

I have the bandwidth to deal with it myself. I would also have taken the trouble and tidy up the house,\n\nHowever, in the second situation, I do not perceive the visiting person as a  100% guest.
