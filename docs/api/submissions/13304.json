The first time I came home, and they said they didn't know they needed to, because I worked at a place that was mainly burgers and that if I wanted them, I could make my own, on the stove. (grill burgers > pan burger imo) The second time, my mom said she did save me one, but let my little sister eat it despite her having one of her own. Eventually I did get one but I did hold a little resentment.  \n\n\nWhile working, I would occasionally told that if I was going to order food, I had to do so for everyone. I was okay with that, I prefer eating with others anyways. However, now that I'm no longer working, I find myself coming upstairs into the living room to find that sometimes they've all ordered food and left me out. I made an offhand comment about being left out, and my dad got upset and called me selfish for expecting to get something just because others get it too.  \n\n\nI once told my mom I felt left out once when my dad took my little sister out to eat, something he's never done for me. Or how he would drive my older sister 45+ to work to and from but wouldn't bother with even a 10 minute drive for me because \"she needed the opportunity more.\" They're always checking up on my oldest sister and how she's doing. My dad said the reason I feel left out, is because I've convinced myself that as the middle child I really am ignored.  \n\n\nJust tonight, I made myself dinner at 7:30pm, then later in the night when I went to the bathroom, I realized they ordered food without me. Or when my mom said my little sister needs more attention because something that happened a few years ago really hurt her, but I'm only a year older and they never asked how it made me feel.  \n\n\nIt's not that I don't get anything at all, my dad bought me a gaming laptop, vr, even an iPad. I appreciate it all, but I just want them to pay attention to me, they know everything my little sister does, but my dad didn't even know that I liked to draw, and I've been doing it since elementary school.

Being treated equally doesn't always mean getting exactly the same things. \nDifferent kids have different needs, even time spent together can't always be the same, but every kid should at least get the same level of interest.\nAnd some things can indeed be completely equal. Like ordering food for everyone but you. If that happens once that's just a misunderstanding, but if it happens regularly, that's bizarre and honestly doesn't sound like just a \"middle child\" problem.\n\nIt's impossible for anyone here to judge how much of it is real and how much is just your perception.\nIs there a reason they could be singling you out? If your parents are unwilling to really talk about this, I'm sorry to say there's probably not much you can do about it, unless there's some other adult you could talk to.", "NTA. It isn\u2019t fair to be treated like that by your parents. As a parent myself, this makes me cringe. It reeks of favoritism and the fact that they brushed it of makes me think they are very much aware of what they are doing.", "NTA\n\nIt's not about getting equal attention. It's about being treated as part of the family. Eating together is very much a family bonding affair. You are part of the family. You should've been included. Your share of the food should've been factored in as well. You shouldn't have to ask them to remember to include your portion of the food for a family do. It's a given that you'd need to have a portion saved because don't they want you to eat with them?\n\nThe other stuff like your dad taking your adult, older sis out for food but never spending time with u and your mum paying attention to your lil sister but not considering your needs are also not ok but the food thing is more of an issue, I feel. The constant exclusion from a family event suggests that they don't see you as part of the family or even as family. This explains why they spare time for your sisters and not you.\n\nNo, you're not being overdramatic or overreacting.", "NTA! Sorry but I'm the eldest child and if my parents ever did this oh they would be in for a rant. I grew up away from my family, there is maybe 4-10 photos of me with my siblings. But they never changed how they acted with us, we each get our time with our parents, plus grandchildren have arrived. But we are all equal, we may not get all the same things but equal", "I dont think its a case of being an asshole or not.\n\nBut more about you not feeling enough love and interest from your parents while it seems your siblings do get that attention\n\nBut if i had to say YTA or NTA then i would say your NTA.\nAlthough i think its just a case of that you need to sit your parents down and talk with them about it, if they react in a bad way then you know your in the right thinking they care more about your siblings.", "Impossible to judge this from my internet armchair without living it. I'll only comment on small bit I find a bit telling.\n\"Or when my mom said my little sister needs more attention because something that happened a few years ago really hurt her, but I'm only a year older and they never asked how it made me feel\"\nHave you considered that it wasn't your parents who asked your sister but instead she who opened up to them?\nYou also only made dinner for yourself yet still expect to be included when the others order dinner while you already ate.\nIt sounds like you want to be included but at the same time are excluding yourself.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Other then that, they kind of just don't acknowledge me?", "I can understand the exclusion in dinner, as I already ate. However my little sister never opened up to my parents about how she felt, she never even complained about what had happened. It was more a thing where every time she did anything wrong, lashed out, or anything of the sort it was always because of what happened. I have tried over and over again telling them how I feel but it's always in my head, I'm *never* right in how I feel. I DID tell them how I felt, I told them how much it hurt, but they never acknowledged it like they did with her and she never spoke up about it at all.", "Yeah but i think its a case of sitting them down for a real serious chat about it, just casually telling them during the day isnt the same, sometimes you just need to sit someone down if its something your very serious about", "Maybe ask for some quality one on one time? Bring a calendar with you and ask please tell me when either of you are free.
