Throwaway not necessary because it doesn\u2019t involve anyone else I know and is kind of silly.\n\nLast week was my birthday and I took a few days off work. I live in NYC and one day I figured I would check out the Central Park Zoo (I\u2019d never been) and then mill around Manhattan, since I had no concrete plan. I needed some caffeine, and I\u2019m one of those freaks that prefers Pepsi to Coke, so I grabbed one from a bodega on the way to the subway. It cost a couple bucks. \n\nSeated on the train, I had earbuds in and was minding my own business. At some point, I noticed this older guy seated next to me and trying to get my attention. I took my earbuds off to see if it was important. He asked me how much my soda was. Okay, weird question, but I answered honestly. Note that at this point I had already opened it and taken a few sips.\n\nTo my surprise, this guy offered to buy it off me for three bucks. One dollar profit for an opened drink. Well, I\u2019m not really that strapped for cash and honestly had been looking forward to drinking it on my ride, so I said sorry, but no.\n\nAt this point the man became insistent. He asked if he could just take a few sips (and I presume give it back). At this point I noticed he had a duffel bag with him. He pulled out a couple pill bottles and explained he needed something to drink to take then.\n\nNow, here\u2019s where I might be the asshole. I definitely made a face of surprise/confusion, and without saying anything else, said some version of \u201cno, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m planning to drink it\u201d and put my earbuds back in. Before they were in my ears, the guy actually said \u201cwow, you\u2019re an asshole\u201d to me. I didn\u2019t respond and just switched my music back on.\n\nOn one hand, it was my beverage and I was planning to drink it. The guy had every option to get off the train and get his own to take his pills. And frankly, I did not want to have a stranger take a sip from my drink and then hand it back to me to drink from the same spout. On the other hand, he may have been in a rush, and taking the pills may have been urgent. While I think asking to borrow the bottle for a few sips is a strange request, I could certainly have profited by a dollar, let him have the whole thing, and perhaps gotten another after exiting the train (though, I will note the bodegas in my neighborhood are cheaper than around Central Park, where I was headed). It wouldn\u2019t have been a huge imposition on me and I could have helped him out.\n\nSo, what do you think? Was I in the wrong?\n\nTL;DR a guy asked me if he could buy or borrow my soda bottle so he could take his pills on the train.
