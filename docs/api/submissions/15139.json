But also, and I\u2019m saying this with genuine concern, your wife needs to back off on the codependency a bit. She needs to be very clear about her boundaries and she absolutely must stick to them otherwise there\u2019s going to be a lifetime of dust ups, hurt feelings, manipulation, and stress.

She has no right to be involved in anything.  This isn't her baby.  It's YOUR baby! Honestly if it were me I'd be pulling back from her mom.  If she's this bad before the kids is even born, I'd be very, very concerned about what she's doing to do when the baby arrives. She's going to try to be the parent regardless of what you and your wife want.  So stand firm now outherwise she's going to walk her entitled self all over yours and your baby's life.

Your wife needs counseling to learn how to keep her mom in her place.  MIL expectations on being a grandparent are not your or your wifes responsibility. It's time for info diets.

I got pregnant last year after 15 years of marriage. My mom thought that she would never have grandchildren because of my fertility issues. She was absolutely over the moon, and not once did she think that she had any right to attend any of my appointments.

The entitlement of your MIL is insane and good for your wife for standing up for herself.", "Edit: her mom responded and immediately backtracked and said she didn't have to talk about it now and she just wants peace.

There are going to be so many unasked for suggestions and opinions on everything, and it\u2019ll likely get worse before it gets better.

This is going to get exhausting so quickly. You need to set strong boundaries now before your child comes.", "NTA\n\nMIL comes off as rather entitled with major boundary issues, and if you and your wife don't stand firm and enforce some boundaries (as well as limiting the info MIL gets as part of that,) your in-laws are likely to keep trying to get into your business and tell you and your wife how to raise your kids.", ">I told my wife that regardless of anything that had happened up to this point, that sentence and level of privilege automatically discounts their side.\n\nI think regardless of anything that had happened up to this point, this /\\\\ sentence and the level of privilege automatically discounts your side.
