There are going to be so many unasked for suggestions and opinions on everything, and it\u2019ll likely get worse before it gets better.

Since when is an ultrasound a spectator sport? People sure have gotten weird in the last 20 years since I started having kids. My parents would never ask, like I won't ask my kids.

My appointments are capped by the medical office at one extra person, my husband in my case, and then they share photos and maybe a video with us after that we can send out to other people if we like.

Why does MIL need to be in the office to look at the screen when she can look at a computer or phone screen just the same later in the day????

She(your wife) seems like a very good person for still wanting her involved but this is getting unhealthy. \n\nPlease let your wife know that she has my support and everybody else's support. This is a crappy dynamic, your in laws need some life lessons about being the GRANDPARENTS not the parents.

You know she'll be demanding to be in the room so you need to stop her now. It isn't enough to say \"no, you can't be there\" because she'll turn up anyway. Just stop telling her anything.

You could even intercept your MILs calls to your wife every second day at this point and still be NTA (I mean with wife permission, of course). \n\nAs someone who is an only child to a single parent who has had the daily phone calls from parents (sometimes multiple calls in a day), it can be hard for parents to let go especially if the \"kid\" feels guilty or obligated to take the calls. \n\n1, your wife needs to learn that she is allowed boundaries for how she lives her own life, and most importantly, she is allowed bodily autonomy.\n\n2, she needs to decide what her boundaries are going to be and the rules that are ro be applied to enforce them, eg, MIL is only allowed to call the wife between 7pm & 8pm MON WED FRI any other none emergency attempts will be ignored, only \"x\" texts a day and any discussion about being present at an appointment requires 2 yeses or 1 no (OP & Wife) and any persistent will be met with no further communication for \"x\" duration. \n\n3, she needs to meet with her mother and tell her the new boundaries and any consequences for crossing them. \n\n4.
