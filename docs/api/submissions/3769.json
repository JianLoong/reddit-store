I understand wanting to teach him consequences, and you did help for the big emergency of not having his bag.\n\nWhere you would be TA though is if you don't help your son to learn from his mistakes. What check-lists does he need in the morning? Does he need to have a reminder near the door to bring his homework? Does he need to pack his bag the night before and check before he goes to bed? \n\nA repeated error in the morning means that he might need to get up ten minutes earlier to not be rushed. \n\nThis is a learning opportunity for him, treat is as such. He's not yet a fully fledged adult so some consequences are fine, but he clearly needs guidance to develop skills to realise his shortfalls in organisational skills", "NTA my 4th graders school won't even allow parents to do this. Kids need to learn responsibility.", "Create a checklist on a whiteboard and put it in his room or by the front door. Have him check every morning to make sure he's got all his stuff.

(And that really sucked because I have a 33-mile commute in each direction. ) People forget their keys in the door, their kid at the store, their doctor appointments, their passwords. Everyone forgets things.\n\nBut there's a fine line between allowing a person to experience natural consequences, and punishment. Your kid is a kid. If your spouse forgot his work at home, would you bring it to him, or would you say, \"Too bad!

Keys? Wallet?' Every time. Yes it was ridiculous to say this to a grown man. But he caught on in a couple weeks.

I was really forgetful about homework/permission slips at this age - and being yelled at by my parents - and being punished for not remembering wasn't helpful.  \n\nWhat would have been helpful was my parents guiding me through ways to help me remember - whether that was checklists, evening reminders, etc.  \n\nSit down with your son and ask him what would be helpful for him - and how you can support him.  If he's sleepy/grumpy in the morning, then make it a plan to get everything ready the night before, and put everything in the same space by the door to grab it when you leave.  Post its.  Checklists.  Whatever it takes.  He will appreciate your help now - it will set him up for success in the years ahead.", "My kids school wouldn't let anything be dropped off to kids. Not even lunch money. (Don't worry, they also had a 'every child eats lunch, NO EXCEPTIONS policy.)", "I don't really understand how we're supposed to help him, honestly. I've pointed out what he knows, if he doesn't want to get a lower grade for turning in his paper late, then he has to take it. I've suggested putting it in his backpack as soon as he's done. I'm not sure what the problem is since he didn't have this problem last year. I might try to start reminding him in the mornings but it's important to me that he learns to take responsibility for it. He doesn't have a phone so can't rely on that", "As an adult seeking an ADHD diagnosis, I've only just this year realized how many things my mother claimed were me being \"lazy\" or \"scatterbrained\" were actual symptoms of an undiagnosed ND. It took my son and nephew both being diagnosed with Autism and other comorbidities to realize how many issues I'd had growing up and into adulthood were clearly related.\n\nI learned coping mechanisms along the way (I have lists upon lists) but some things are unavoidable, like when I open a browser window to search for something and forget what I was about to search.\n\nMaking a checklist and putting it by the front door so he can look at it before he leaves is super easy. It's also super easy to spend 5 minutes when he gets home asking him what he has to do for each class and making another checklist for assignments. I understand the idea of \"teaching your child responsibility\" but doing this with them for a few weeks will establish a routine and they will learn to do it themselves.\n\nTrust me: it bothers them that this keeps happening. Being told you're irresponsible or immature in situations like this SUCKS. I have a BA and STILL forget things, because it has nothing to do with maturity or responsibility or intelligence, our brains literally work differently! We don't really have attention problems, we have executive function issues, ADHD just sounds better than EFD or whatever.", "Thank you. I read a rant from an annoyed mom. I didn\u2019t read a note from a concerned parent trying to help a child through an important life lesson. People are picking up on how important the lesson is but failing to realize how inadequately the parent is handling this.", "So letting your kids know they can't come to you if they have a problem is a valuable lesson?", "Exactly. How else is he going to learn not to rely on mom for everything?\n\nIf mom would have had a job instead of being a SAHM, it wouldn't even be possible to bring him his stuff.\n\nHe needs to take responsibility.", "Jesus, you really do pathologize everything in the US", "Since when was forgetting things not completely normal for a 13 Yr old", "I was thinking maybe a white board checklist on the front door or his bedroom door?", "We\u2019ve started a routine with my 4th grade daughter that when she gets to the door but before leaving she has to pat herself down: glasses, backpack, lunchbox. If she has every she can head out to the bus stop. When she finishes her homework she has to pack her backpack immediately.  She\u2019ll show me and we\u2019ll countdown what she has: homework folder, Chromebook, assignment book, etc. her backpack is then put next to the door she exits from to go to the bus stop. Yes it\u2019s a bit of work in my end but it\u2019s getting her into a routine that she does automatically. She\u2019s gotten much better at keeping track of her school items. As a parent you and your husband have to help your son figure out the best way for him to keep track of his stuff.", "I don't know about your kid, but 7th grade was a rough transition for mine from elementary school. NTA, but I suggest you boost your parental radar a bit, see if this is part of a larger issue.", "I literally have to ask my 12 yr old every day \"got your laptop? Got your glasses? Etc\" before we leave the answer is always no and they have to run to grab at least 2 of the things listed. Make yourself a list of his needs for school put it on the door to look at and go over before leave.", "I\u2019d say refer to the comment above about getting him checked out for any kind of disorder. I have a friend who is a fully functioning adult with a high paying job, and she has to keep all of her vitamins on the counter or otherwise she will forget they ever existed. He may need all of his stuff displayed in a very obvious location in order to remember to take it with him every day.", "I have found checklists work great for helping my kids stay organized. Have a written checklist. (write the checklist on a whiteboard with wet erase marker and have them check off each item with dry erase) Ask them if they ran their checklist at the appropriate time (before bed, before school, etc)", "I remember in jr high going to my cousin's house and seeing a checklist on the back door, of tasks/items that needed to be remembered before school.  Maybe something like that?  People don't automatically know how to do things, and behaviours need to be taught as well as caught.  If he hasn't caught enough of the needed behaviours to function well in this situation, you can teach him.  If he needs more guidance than you're expecting, oh well, that's all right.  It's all part of parenting, and I'm sure you can figure something out.  :)", "Teach him a routine that helps him. My husband and I are very intelligent but absent minded adults so we have a routine just before we leave every day:\n\nKeys\nPhone\nPurse/ wallet\nLunch  \n\nAnd we pat each place for it. It works well", "7th and 8th grade was a really tough transition period for me. I went from straight as to bs, and in my stress I did become forgetful. I am very similar to your son OP, I am a perfectionist. I failed a class last year because I forgot to turn in assignments. I'd recommend putting some sort of visual reminder in the morning. Also, it sounds like my adhd does, I'll start to put things away and notice something else (ex: oh I forgot to get my stapler) and forget my homework on the table while I go look for my stapler. Oh no my desk drawer is a mess. And on and on until I've forgotten about homework completely. You'll need multiple visual reminders. Perhaps one on his bedroom door, and a sticky note in the kitchen next to the cereal, or wherever he's most likely to see it.", "This is totally different. Teaching them responsibility about thinking about their own stuff is not the same as not helping them when there's a real issue."]}
