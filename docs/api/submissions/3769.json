I understand wanting to teach him consequences, and you did help for the big emergency of not having his bag.\n\nWhere you would be TA though is if you don't help your son to learn from his mistakes. What check-lists does he need in the morning? Does he need to have a reminder near the door to bring his homework? Does he need to pack his bag the night before and check before he goes to bed? \n\nA repeated error in the morning means that he might need to get up ten minutes earlier to not be rushed. \n\nThis is a learning opportunity for him, treat is as such. He's not yet a fully fledged adult so some consequences are fine, but he clearly needs guidance to develop skills to realise his shortfalls in organisational skills", "NTA my 4th graders school won't even allow parents to do this. Kids need to learn responsibility.", "Create a checklist on a whiteboard and put it in his room or by the front door. Have him check every morning to make sure he's got all his stuff.

(And that really sucked because I have a 33-mile commute in each direction. ) People forget their keys in the door, their kid at the store, their doctor appointments, their passwords. Everyone forgets things.\n\nBut there's a fine line between allowing a person to experience natural consequences, and punishment. Your kid is a kid. If your spouse forgot his work at home, would you bring it to him, or would you say, \"Too bad!

Keys? Wallet?' Every time. Yes it was ridiculous to say this to a grown man. But he caught on in a couple weeks.

Be a damned parent. \n\nMaybe this is such a thorn in my side due to having grown up with \"you should know this by now, you're smart enough, just try harder\" instead of \"it's a natural executive dysfunction due to adhd, there's nothing wrong with you but here's what you can do to help remembering stuff\", but it really f-ing grinds my gears when people don't connect the dots.
