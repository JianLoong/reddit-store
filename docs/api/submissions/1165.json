Follow your instincts OP as this reeks of someone being taken advantage of. Good luck!", "NTA and there's no reason you shouldn't cut these people out of your life. They're making it clear they don't care about you.", "NTA - of course not. You are friend first, roommate second, and babysitter third. if you feel like you\u2019re getting used make sure you set an emotionally healthy boundary.", "NTA. Your time is your own! Anyone wanting a free babysitter isn\u2019t a friend. You are right to set a boundary with this ( and anything else if they are taking advantage of you) Friends don\u2019t USE friends.", "NTA - Wow, she is really rude and selfish. She doesn\u2019t sound like a good friend.", "NTA. Screw that person. Stop babysitting for them. But first, tell them how this event made you feel, and why you\u2019re not willing to babysit for them anymore as it impacts your social life with your friend group.", "**NTA**\n\nYou are never an AH for saying no to something that you don't want to do. You have no standing obligation to be her babysitter unless you are under contract to do so.\n\nAlso, she's not much of a friend if she invited all of your mutual friends to a concert with her and then turned around and instead of inviting you as well, suggested that you babysit her kids. It's one thing if you had volunteered (I'm totally that person...I hate crowds and would literally rather spend the evening with my friends' kids, LOL), but suggesting that you miss a friend group event to be the babysitter while everyone else goes out together? Yeah, no. She is not your friend. And you are NTA.", "NTA", "Because I totally understand a single parent job is not easy and she does not have a huge amount of help moving to a new area", "So?\nIts not your responsibility, not your kid"]}
