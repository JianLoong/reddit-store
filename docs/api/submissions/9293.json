{"id": 9293, "submission_id": "10v7ktk", "title": "AITA for not wanting to put in a word for my brother?", "selftext": "  \n\nMy brother (m 17) has recently been trying to find a job and he was hired for one about 2 days ago and had his 1st day today. However, the pay isn't very good, I believe he said it was \u00a34.81 even though it's the minimum wage for someone his age in the UK. He\u2019s now nagging me to put a good word in for him at my current place.\n\nFor context, about 4 months ago I got hired at a supermarket that paid well and the pay was above minimum wage. So everyone got paid equally, only it varying if you\u2019ve worked at the store more than 3 years. I work at a branch closest to our home. A month later, he applied for a store assistant position at the same supermarket as me. His application was well done, and I was proud of him for taking a step forward. He was emailed not too long later to come in for a group interview. He was excited and booked the interview for that week.\n\nBut later I found out that family members cannot work in the same branch from my manager. I told him this and explained he could still work for the supermarket just at a different branch. The 2nd closest branch was just a little further away, but you could still easily get there by bike or bus. For some reason, this information really pissed him off and I tried to get him to calm down. As he continued to rage on about it, he insulted my manager of the branch I work at and the area manager of our town. He screamed that I should move branches so he could work at the one I was at. I explained that was impossible because I was still being trained, but I had also just gotten to know everyone at this branch. I had already settled in. I decided to leave it at that. \n\nThe day of the group interview comes, and he didn\u2019t go saying he didn\u2019t want to travel to a different branch. I didn\u2019t say anything else other than, he couldn\u2019t apply for the supermarket for another 6 months now.\n\nFast forward to now, I\u2019ve worked for this supermarket for 4 months now and I have no intention on leaving this job or branch for a while. My brother doesn\u2019t like his pay and has been talking about it none stop. He keeps nagging me to put in a good word for him and I keep saying no, explaining he shouldn\u2019t have insulted the people he could have potentially worked for. He says I\u2019m being unfair and that he\u2019s willing to travel to another branch now. But I keep repeating myself saying, you should have been willing 4 months ago. Our dad thinks I\u2019m being harsh, but I think I\u2019m being reasonable. \n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1675692752, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10v7ktk/aita_for_not_wanting_to_put_in_a_word_for_my/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He'll be in for a really rude awakening when he needs to get a full time job to support himself.\n\nGiven how wildly unprofessionally he handled it, I wouldn't put in a good word for him either.  It will reflect badly upon you if he has another temper tantrum.    \n\nEven if his temper tantrum was not at work, I still would never put in a good word for him, because I wouldn't trust him not to do the same thing at work.", "NTA. Jeez, your brother is being entitled. Why should you have to relocate to benefit him? That's ridiculous.", "NTA\n\nThere is no reason for you to be involved in your brother's job search or employment at this point. And your word isn't going to do him any good after he flaked out on the original interview. He needs to know how that kind of thing looks to potential employers sooner than later.\n\nEven if you put in a good word for him, he still won't get the job. And he'll probably try to blame you. Best to stay out of it entirely.", "NTA\n\nHis behavior at interview (that he didn't go to) showed everyone that he is not a suitable person to work there. His continued protestations further show that his inability to accept facts.\n\nI would not put in a word for him either since he is being so childish about this. I can only imagine how he will treat the customers if things don't go his way.", "Actions have consequences. NTA", "NTA based on his previous reaction. Never recommend someone for a job unless you think it will reflect well on you", "NTA - your brother needs to grow up.", "Your brother is an entitled hypocrite. NTA.", "NTA, it blows my mind people act that way then ask you to give them a recommendation for employment. Why would I want my name associated with someone who is disrespectful.", "NTA. He already blew off one interview since he didn't want to go further away. He could have called them and said he was no longer interested. You don't want to have his actions reflect negatively on you and it sounds like you already tried to help him once. Him expecting expecting to switch to the other store when you've already settled in is absurd.", "Actions have consequences. Your brother is free to apply to the next-closest branch on his own. Honestly, your \"good word\" won't mean all that much: you're a young new employee speaking up for your brother - nobody expects this to be an unbiased evaluation of his merits. So your brother won't be significantly harmed by you not speaking for him.\n\nOn the other hand, jerking the supermarket around like he did last time won't speak well of him.\n\nNTA", "NTA, but seriously, how much weight is your \"good word\" going to have? You are working an entry-level job, you've been employed for 4 months. Your recommendation, with all due respect, will not mean much.\n\n Just mention to your manager that your brother appears to have learned his lesson and sends his apologies (if that is indeed true). Leave it at that. That would count as putting in a word, and it's really the best you can do.", "NTA - I put a word in for my own brother where I work, he last 2 months, and quit in the spot with no notice. I felt completely responsible for it. Now, I won\u2019t ever make that mistake again.", "NTA. He let an emotional moment impact him long-term; this is a lesson for him to learn. You did nothing wrong by declining his request because he's acting irrational and entitled, just like he did 4 months prior by asking you to move stores. Your brother feels he is worth and deserves more, but wants it handed to him, and it rings of narcissism.\n\nYour father taking his side seems like a display of favoritism. You gave the logical consequences of your brother's actions; this is not harsh, it's how life works, and he should know that as your dad. Furthermore, it was your dad's job to tell him not to bite the hand that feeds; again, this isn't harsh, that's how life works.", "There is nothing stopping him from applying to the other branch right now.   Nothing.  He can put you down as a reference and they can call you, I suppose.  But I'm not understanding what he's expecting you to do here.  If he hasn't even applied, there's nothing you can really help him with, is there?\n\nNTA", "It\u2019s not down to you anyway.  If the rules are that you can\u2019t reapply for 6 months then I\u2019m not sure why they think that you have the power to override that.   Also, your brother behaved really immaturely (probably because he is still a child and has no life experience) and what\u2019s to say he won\u2019t behave that way again.  If you put yourself out and he messes up then it reflects badly on you.  Why should you have to risk your reputation for him.  What is your dads logic on this?", "NTA. Why would you burn yourself for someone that still didn't prove to have work ethic? Plus, your word will not help him and might be prejudicial to you.", "NTA - your brother is a little immature but he\u2019s learning his lesson. Eventually you should help him out in the future if you can. Even though he messed up, the lesson can still be learned and forgiven. It\u2019s your lil bro.", "NTA. Your brother\u2019s behavior would indicate that you shouldn\u2019t do anything to a system and getting a job because he\u2019s only going to make you look bad.

He was on the verge of moving in with his brother and paying 200 for rent. That's a goddamn pittance. Something that's more than doable at that minimum wage, even if he's only working 20 hours. \n\nOP has been more than generous throughout this entire situation. In no way is he an asshole for not offering *MORE* help to someone who shat all over him over a 20 minute commute. \n\nIn fact, putting in any sort of good word for someone who has already proven themselves unstable and unreliable puts *OP's* future there at risk. \n\nOP has done plenty already, and his brother has been nothing but ungrateful, *across two different AITA posts*."]}
