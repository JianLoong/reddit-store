It hurt but I agreed because I didn't want to harm my marriage. The past couple holiday seasons have been rough on me. I just don't enjoy holidays with my in laws at all. They have like 30 people there, everyone is so loud, food is dry and bland, just no one I connect with, and it makes me miss spending holidays with my mom.\n\nRecently my wife brought up the holidays and i let her know how I was feeling. she said she sympathized but was not wasting another Christmas with my bitch mom. I asked if we could start staying home every other year and just doing something the four of us. My wife blew up. She said I was selfish and trying to ruin her holidays just because my mom is a bitch, that I don't care about our kids because they love it (they do but they are 4 and 2 and I think would love anything if we made it exciting for them), and she said I need to act like a grown man and put my feelings aside for the good of the family. \n\nI feel I had the right to just ask and she owed me at least an adult conversation.", "created_utc": 1666963884, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yfo9xq/aita_for_asking_my_wife_if_we_can_spend_every/", "score": 4038, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your kids will love what you do no matter what.", "You are right. You have a right to have your feelings valued, and to not be yelled at. NTA. Please go to couple's counseling. \n\nPS: Did your mom even have a wedding? A lot of older people skip the party and just sign documents at the court house. I worry about the rest of your examples- does not catering to the kids mean not feeding them, or not cooking multiple individual meals for them? How is your wife defining rude? I fully acknowledge that your mom might be an ass, but when your wife is this angry, and this aggressive about a simple conversation, I worry that your mother isn't the problem.", "NTA but she is. Shoving your feelings down and being miserable should never be part of being a good man or husband. That's some toxic shit.

That seems really odd.", "NTA, you compromised w/her, she needs to do the same w/you.", "NTA... you wife is an AH and please tell her I said that. \nYes. You should be able to have an adult conversation with out her blowing up.\nYes. A compromise that includes your feelings and preferences should be on the table. And you should never fear discussing how you feel with your partner. \nHonestly your wife sounds like a dictator.  Did you marry someone as rude as your mom? Or was your mom rude because your wife is an AH? \nYou need to revisit this conversation with her. See a therapist if you need help finding ways to become more assertive in your relationship.

SHE alone doesn't get to decide these things. You shouldn't be forced to put your feelings aside because she wants to go to her family.

I don't blame her for not wanting to spend time with your mother but that doesn't mean she now gets to decide that you all go to her family 100% of the time. And it was way out of order for her to call your mum a bitch.\n\nI think that having every Christmas with a big family isn't always great for the kids anyway. Make your own traditions, have your own fun where your kids are the centre of your attention and it's less chaos. Then maybe go to her family on Boxing Day for a big get together? It's not like you're suggesting doing this every year.\n\nAsk your wife why spending every other holiday with just the two of you and the kids is such an issue?

That's not partnership. That's scorekeeping.\n\nI think your suggestion was a perfectly fair compromise.\n\nI also think it's unkind that she said that the four of you staying home together every other year would \"ruin her holidays\". And saying you don't care about your kids is manipulative. Your wife's intent here was to win, not to resolve. Also not partnership.\n\nYour mom isn't the only one who is rude, I'm afraid.

Your request sounds like a perfect compromise and if you can\u2019t come to an agreement I would tell your wife that every other Christmas you\u2019ll be spending Christmas at home. If she doesn\u2019t like it she is free to join you but remind her she is not the sole person responsible for arranging your holiday plans.

Or how about taking the family on a vacation during the holidays?  There is no reason why you now have to spend every holiday at your inlaws.  You wife is acting selfish and very entitled.\n\nSorry you are having drama on top of existing drama.", "NTA your wife sounds toxic and manipulative. I get standing up for your partner, but backing her for a decision she made without your input about your family doesn\u2019t seem reasonable. Is there context missing?

Why not use your time the way you wish.", "NTA. You asked for an honest compromise after doing the same for your wife and she reacted by essentially telling you to grow up.

Loved every moment of it and changed how we do holidays.", "NTA- No partner should monopolize how their family should spend their holidays.  That's just silly.  This reminds me of my parents during Christmas.  We always saw my mom's side of the family and rarely my dad's.

Wife = YTA, seems a bit selfish, but you know her better than some random Redditor. Good luck!", "NTA. It\u2019s not okay for her to ruin your holidays either.

You're suggesting spending it with just her and your kids, your immediate family.\n\nAnd she has the audacity to say your ruining HER holidays!? They're not her holidays. When one is married, some things no longer become MY [THING] and instead becomes OUR [THING]. Holidays fall under shared ownership in marriage.\n\nYour wife can't even give up her thing and would rather you be miserable, when a viable option is available, start spending some holidays with only wife and kids.

It is DV,", "You and your mom need to see a therapist. \n\nThe pain of losing a parent when you two have fixable issues is way more unbearable than an inappropriate toy at Christmas. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t wish that on anyone. \n\nYou spouse, on the other hand? I\u2019ll say this: my uncle was married to a woman exactly like her for 30+ years. He celebrated the day she had a botched routine surgery that essentially killed her. \n\nYou have some tough decisions to make.", "Do you mean your mom had you at a very young age? Were you planned? Was your dad present?\n\nBtw you keep saying your mother is rude, but from every exemple it is your wife who seems obnoxious", "Stand-offishness, snarkiness. Not verbal abuse.", "This is his mother. It is a higher threshold to cut her out if his holidays and holidays with his children than a rude friend", "My son is married to one of those. I\u2019m sick of her and disgusted with his behavior. No backbone. If he wants to put up with her bullying and gaslighting, go for it, but I\u2019m not going to.", "You at least bring it up with your son in private.", "There would have been two white dresses at that wedding...", "AITA for not inviting my son and his wife to my wedding\u2026", "I would say ABUSED son. He can't say anything without being yelled at and insulted, which is DV.", "The 3 oldest are adults, but the ones living with her were all still in school, 2 in high school and one in middle school", "Yeah, but you can be narcissistic and have similar behaviors without actually having NPD... Plus they can be comorbid, 15% of people with BPD also have NPD.", "OP says he talked to her. \n\nHis mom doesn\u2019t sound great. And neither does his wife. But it\u2019s definitely not a case of his mom only sucks because his wife sucks.", "He isn't asking to spend every other year with his mom though, just the 4 of them. Idk we swap on and off years, so does my sister. My husband hates big gatherings, so we made a compromise. He is also welcome not to come to the on years if he isn't up for it, and my family is totally okay with that. He has never chosen to, as he appreciates we do an off year. \n\nTo me it sounds like the wife is controlling and not letting him have much of a say in anything. All he asked for every other year focusing on their own family, and she acts like he is some crazy person. There is also the option of spending the holidays every other year as their family, and maybe a week later or before going to the in-laws. I truly hope OP finally stands up for themselves and what they want to do.", "Staying home on Christmas with your children is NOT self-isolating and frankly it's quite enjoyable. We used to go to my mom's on Christmas day but decided to start celebrating at her house a different day and stay home in our pajamas on Christmas and play games, etc., and it's a really good time. That's not at all a horrible suggestion and it wouldn't have killed his wife to hear him out instead of shutting him down. \n\nIt also sounds like a good compromise to me. One year they do what she wants. The following they do what he wants (while not making her go to his moms). And alternate like that each year. Why is that so bad?", "Bruh, what? He agreed with her to go NC, sure. His mom sounds like a piece of work. But what is he trying to pull on his wife? He literally only asked that every other year they would go to his wife's family gatherings and would stay home the rest to spend time with HIS family. He sounds like an introvert. Introverts aren't passive about their lives and they aren't spineless like you are implying. The way his wife freaked out on him is fucking odd though. Revenge for him going NC with his mom? What even? OP is NTA here. His wife sure seems like one though", "What's the opposite of Main Character Syndrome? This guy is an NPC in his own life!", "How is spending holidays with your immediate family depressing? Lots of people do it - and maybe he wants to include friends or neighbors or something. It\u2019s weird to say: wife\u2019s family for holidays or you\u2019re a sad depressed loner.\n\nAnd you made up that he hates socializing - he enjoyed the social scene at his mom\u2019s but agrees it\u2019s not appropriate for children.", "I mean even if that were the case thats his mom and he\u2019s her son with her grand kids. Hating his wife shouldnt be a reason for her to not accommodate to her grandkids.", "I liked everyone my mom invited besides the few who were fighting. Her guests were just more laid back and interesting. I loved my moms good so I\u2019m not sure where you are getting that. There there wasn\u2019t much for the kids. We did have to watch our kids more at her party though as no one else was interested in them vs at my uh laws certain relatives want to take them", "> That's what Christmas is for a lot of families!\n\nAnd some people think swearing around children is bad. Children who swear get in trouble and it\u2019s difficult to teach a child not to say words they heard adults say.\n\nAnd adult conversation is often about sex, and you really shouldn\u2019t be talking about sexual encounters with young kids.", "Why is it that people is so scared of swearing in front of kids? It's not like they wont swear when they grow up...", "I mean, you right you right. I\u2019m getting the vibe that mum has just completely checked out on her son based on his own comments", "Yeah, I read the comments OP made after I said this. I think it's just a case of a lot of dysfunction all around. I don't love that the wife made this decision apparently unilaterally in a case which didn't involve abuse, though. But I agree, it's not a case where one person is bad and one person is perfect.", "The way she's responding and acting, has me agreeing with other commenter that she was the issue and not ops mom.", "Yes! Jeez people are getting off topic here", "As a kid those were always my favorite Christmases when it was my mom and dad and us four boys.", "My family very rarely does big get togethers for holidays. None of us like it and we enjoy getting together with just the immediate siblings and parents. OPs ask was not a big one at all and any other speculation about the mother is irrelevant because he's not asking his wife to spend time with her.\n\nNTA", "\u201cHow is spending holidays with your immediate family depressing?\u201d\n\nOh, bless you sweet summer child.", "Meh, I grew up driving 6 hours both ways for Christmas every year. It was miserable and we begged to stay home for Christmas one year. My parents relented and it did end up being one of the most boring Christmases we had. I\u2019m not a social person either, but I just have a drink and listen in to those around me. \n\nHe can always be tending the kids, playing with any pets, etc. I don\u2019t see how he can\u2019t entertain himself in a group for a few hours.", "Great question that I am happy to answer.  It\u2019s because kids have no filter and will say those words everywhere: at school, in places of worship, to their grandparents.  Re: at school, the parents end up getting hauled in for meetings with teachers and staff and getting hate from other parents and their kids end up disinvited to events. Re: other places, your older relatives end up lecturing you.  It makes what is already a tough job as it (trying to raise civilized human beings who can function in the world) even harder.", "Rude. But true \ud83e\udd23\n\n*how is spending holidays with your immediate family automatically depressing?\n\nThe point was holidays with immediate family isn\u2019t *inherently* depressing but yes of course -for some people (and some families) it\u2019s definitely depressing. That\u2019s a possibility but not a given. Especially when your immediate family is a spouse and two toddlers lol", "He probably can but shouldn\u2019t he get to enjoy Christmas too? \n\nIt\u2019s ridiculous that you were miserable every year for Christmas - except for the one year you were bored. Your family should have figured out something better."]}
