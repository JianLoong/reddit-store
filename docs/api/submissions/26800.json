My wife has always been really good about staying aware of things happening in my life that I care about and periodically checking in with me to see how they're going. (You know - basic loving, caring partner stuff.) \n\nI have found that showing her that same consideration does not always come naturally to me. I would say I am a fairly self-centered person. I wish that weren't the case but in retrospect a lot of bad behavior on my part was not corrected and even enabled when I was young. By the time I realized this character flaw I was alrrady well into adulthood and I have found that old habits die hard.\n\nI don't think I'm THAT bad. Of course sometimes I DO remember that she was having that big meeting at work today or that her aunt was having a surgery or whatever and I ask about it over dinner. But more often than I am proud to admit I get lost in my stuff and forget about hers. \n\nSo a couple years ago I started setting reminders in my calendar so I wouldn't forget. Needless to say I did not tell her I was doing this. \n\nUntil now it's worked really well. Often I don't even need the reminder - just creating it helps the event stick in my active memory. \n\nBut the other night she saw one of my reminders. (She has a potentially painful dental procedure later this week, FYI.) We both happened to be looking at something on my phone when it popped up. \n\nNeedless to say she was surprised. I had no choice but to explain the whole situation. \n\nI wouldn't say she thinks I'm a full-blown asshole. But she definitely found it weird and off-putting that I would need a system like that when she doesn't and nobody else does. \n\nI kind of agree with her. It never felt like a deep dark secret, but on the other hand there's obviously a reason I never told her or anyone else I was doing it. Still, taking action to make sure I show consideration and concern for stuff that matters to her has to be better than continuing to forget, right? \n\nAm I an asshole? \n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1694625769, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ht0wv/aita_my_wife_discovered_that_i_keep_calendar/", "score": 2370, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You made an extra effort to make sure you\u2019re speaking her love language. If I discovered my DH did this I\u2019d be delighted.", "NAH, I can actually address both sides of this. \n\nUp until about 6 months ago, I was known as the girl with the elephant memory. I remembered everything all the time and didn't have a real understanding of how other people didn't. I wasn't mean about it, it just perplexed me, \"how don't you remember something important to someone you love?!\" It didn't help that both my parents have memories like mine so it was also how I grew up. \n\n6 months ago I got a virus (not the mexican beer virus), that caused encephalitis, and my memory just wooshed away. I could be opening the door to my house to grab something really important, it's on the forefront of my mind and by the time I have closed it, I stand there like, \"what did I need to get?\" It actually shook me significantly, I didn't realize how much of my life and my own sense of self I had wrapped up in my memory. I started to write everything down, constantly. I got a tablet that syncs between my phone and computer, so I always have access to my notes. \n\nYou're not self centered, you brain just works differently than your wife's brain does. You're learning style is more kinesthetic (it's why you remember when you write it down). I was previously primarily auditory, and secondary visual, and now I'm almost completely kinesthetic. Maybe look up the different types (there are more) to show your wife, it may help her understand a little more why you do things the way you do. \ud83d\ude42", "NAH \n\nMy husband would greatly benefit from doing something similar. He mitigates it by asking me how my day went and also to remind him of something big was happening the morning of or a day before.", "NAH. You find it doesn\u2019t come naturally, so you found a technique to help you do it. Many people might get defensive or insist that there is no way for them to remember. Not you! You figured out a system that would work for you. Good job.", "NAH. It's reasonable to need a system to help remind you to remind other people you care. It's also reasonable to be slightly weirded out by it, but I'm sure she'll understand.", "NAH. It's genius. For someone who doesn't have that problem, she might think that you don't care, which is why she's upset. She doesn't understand that your brain just works differently. It took me a long time to get that point across. By doing this, you are showing that you do care and taking steps to show it. Your brain just works differently than hers.", "NAH, I\u2019m a very late diagnosed neurodivergent, and what I can and can\u2019t remember is really unpredictable. I live and die by to-do lists and phone reminders. \n\nBut, society in general has a tendency to be super ableist around memory and emotional connection. A lot of neurotypical folks who don\u2019t struggle with working memory just don\u2019t grasp how hard it can be for some other people to keep track of things. There is a definite assumption that if you really care about something, it will stick in your memory. If you haven\u2019t personally dealt with memory issues, or spent a lot of time around people who have, it\u2019s really easy to assume that forgetting something means you don\u2019t care about it. The idea that your partner would have to consciously remind themself to ask about important things in your life can seem strange and cold at first. \n\nMy ex partner was a little insulted early in our relationship that I did something similar. I had to explain that my memory is just absolute dog shit, even for things I really care about. Like, I\u2019ll routinely have to set alarms to remember to eat because I forgot my own body exists. \n\nIt sounds like you\u2019ve been going to a lot of effort to shield your wife from the work you do to make her feel cared for. Finding things like that out can be disconcerting. I\u2019d suggest just talking about it, and giving her a little bit of time to get used to the idea. If she continues to act like this is something to be ashamed of/upset about, then you may have a problem.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

One of the interesting things from the neurological research even is that standard prefrontal cortex goal-oriented planning and memory is impaired, and ends up being compensated for by call-response style 'habits'. That's why for ADHD you might end up with overly-simplistic reactions to things (my phone's text message alert just went off? Better check because that's what one does when the alert goes off) rather than a more appropriate goal based way of acting (actually, I'm driving and there's no text coming in that's important enough to be worth checking right now). That was an example from a specific research paper I read a while back I thought was amusing.\n\nAnyway. I look at it like this. My calendar reminders are kind of a prosthetic device of sorts. It allows me to function with a nearly 'normal' level of functionality, even in arenas like this where I'm naturally pretty handicapped. The fact that it lives outside my head instead of inside is kind of beside the point I figure, what matters is that I'm able to set goals, and consistently reach them. Remembering things about my partner's life certainly sits on my list of goals, and achieving it is in the remembering at the right time. That's it.\n\nI feel like it doesn't matter HOW you do what you do, what matters is WHAT you choose to do. And besides, you're treating your calendar like a safety rope.

I do need to use this kind of tool personally. And like... I don't know. It's like those old person tools for opening jars. Even if you can open your jars without the tool, why's using a tool to help a bad thing? It's not like it's hurting anyone. The fact that your girlfriend doesn't know anyone that needs to use calendar reminders doesn't mean it's not common, it just means her friends happen to not be the kind of people who struggle with this sort of a thing. People like us do exist, and there's nothing wrong with that.\n\nActually, might be worth looking into seeing if you've got any diagnosable reason to struggle with this kind of memory stuff. It'd be cool if you could stop thinking of yourself as a self centered person, if the reason you struggle here is more mechanical.", "> But she definitely found it weird and off-putting that I would need a system like that when she doesn't and nobody else does. \n\nLots of people have a system like that.

I always told her I\u2019d pass on the message to him, and always did.

I never made a move on him, but there were more than a few times when I thought he was about to. \n\nOne day I was moving some work gear out of our company vehicle, and came across a to-do list of his. On it was \u201cCall Nancy\u201d, \u201cAsk Nancy about her trip\u201d, \u201cDon\u2019t forget to see Nancy this weekend.\u201d Not having much relationship experience myself, I thought he must have really been on the last thread with her if he had to remind himself to pay attention to her. I thought this was good news for me LOL. \n\nTurns out he was completely devoted to her and ended up marrying her and they\u2019re still together 20 years later. I think it was his prioritization of her that really helped them.", "NTA I applaud your efforts. It may have seemed weird to her at that moment but honestly, if she doesn\u2019t realize that you were doing it as a self improvement exercise and understand your reasoning, then she may be more self centered than you ever thought you were.  I am one of those people if I write it or type it I\u2019ll remember it better. Just to read or be told an event it will be tossed into the gray zone. We both have our own phone calendars and a shared family calendar in kitchen. There\u2019s reminders for tons of things in all 3. Carry on!", "I think it's cute!", "I would find this thoughtful honestly. I know not everyone is wired the same. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Not even remotely. We all get caught up in ourselves at times and having a reminder that makes you stop for a moment is excellent.", "NTA. Due to medical and medical conditions, I swear I can barely remember my name. I have post it\u2019s and reminders in my phone. I always laugh when my husband asks me to remind him of something later. Like, DUDE.", "Nta the fact you care enough about her to do this is you showing her that you love her", "NTA. Is it possible you're neurodivergant? Because I know others who do this same thing. And while I might not forget to ask about what's going on in a partners life, I do forget other important things... like booking doctors appointments for myself or my kids, or remembering to actually take them to said appointments. As soon as I commit to something now, I put it in my phone. And set a reminder for three days before, the day before three hours before, and two hours before (if it's in the city which is an hour drive away. Half hour before if it's in town). \n\nI'd simply explain to her that you're aware you get lost in your own stuff, but because you love her you are trying to be more engaged with her. The alarms are to help you develop the habit of starting those conversations. \n\nYou are putting in thought and effort to improve yourself and your relationship. That's amazing. Be proud of yourself, you are definitely not the ahole here", "NAH\n\nHere's the thing. She is important to you. And you know it is important to her that you ask about stuff going on with her. Since it's not your natural reaction, but because she is important, and this is important to her, you created a work around to compensate for your shortcoming in this area.\n\nIf you feel like you need to further explain, I'd kind of tell her what I just told you above. \"Mary, this is a shortcoming of mine, but I adore you, and I want to make you happy, so I created this workaround, so that my shortcoming would not hurt you.\"", "NTA. I think it\u2019s a beautiful thing to recognize what you need to improve and come up with a system to make it work.", "NTA you work on your marriage every day and she doesn't like it, wow just wow. Ask her if she wants you to stop", "NTA.\n\nI can definitely understand why this had an effect on your wife--and, admittedly, I probably would have felt the same were I in this situation, at least initially. This really just shows that you understand how your \"shortcomings\" (I really don't see this as such; we're all built different) may impact your relationship, and you've taken steps to ensure that your wife doesn't feel undervalued. Definitely shows how much you care.", "NAH\nThat's so sweet of you to find a way to remember her important events. It shows you care. \n\nShe was probably caught off guard. Just make sure she understands the sweet place you're coming from and that you just want to make sure you never forget things. She might wonder if the reminders are because you don't actually care and be questioning if your conversations about her life are actually genuine.", "NAH you are doing great. Just let her know that you are doing your best to make her feel hard and love and this is what works for you. Great job, my guy", "Holy shit, a nuanced situation? On this sub?\n\nWhat timeline is this", "As someone with adhd, I see no problem with this. I have in the past kept a running log in my notes app of information about a person that I\u2019m dating and also short timeline with information about each date. It\u2019s not because I\u2019m weird but because I am oblivious sometimes and also I am very forgetful. But then again, I\u2019m a note taker in general so I kind of do it with everything.", "NTAH \n\nEveryone\u2019s memory and capacity for information is different, you found a system that works for you. \nIt\u2019s really thoughtful in my opinion.", "NTA at all. I do this. My contact book, I'm not proud to say either, lists people along with their spouses, kids and maybe some interesting fact that I should try to remember to help me with conversation. I'm not good at the birthday and fluffy stuff at work either. Good for you for recognizing it and finding a system that works, hopefully your wife will see and understand that.", "NAH\n\nCall me a sap but I would absolutely love it if my partner did this for me. It\u2019s even sweeter that you do it when it doesn\u2019t come naturally to you. I bet your wife will understand and come around eventually.", "OP you're NTA you care and that makes you wonderful.", "Just so you know you might not be self centered. That potentially sounds like ADHD. I have lists upon lists and reminders upon reminders otherwise I forget. The fact that you\u2019re making an effort shows you care. NTA.", "NTA. You took corrective steps because you love her.", "Not an s/o, but a good friend of mine marked an important job interview of mine in his calendar. I saw it by accident, and he got pretty embarrassed, but he was glad when I told him how much I appreciated it. I think I\u2019ll remember how that made me feel forever. It felt great to know someone cared that deeply about what was going on in my life.\n\nNeedless to say, NTA.", "NTA proof you\u2019re working on a thing you wanted to change. I\u2019m adhd and I need a system for everything.", "This is the sweetest thing ever. Faith in love restored.", "NTA For what it's worth I do that for everyone in my life. There's so many distractions in life, it's easy to let time pass and forget to follow up on stuff you mean to.", "NAH\n\nYou recognized a flaw in your behavior and found a way to compensate for it. For someone with a \"normal\" level of empathy, it might seem off putting, but you found a way to give her what you knew she needed in a way that works for you.\n\nInstead of bemoaning what you didn't learn during your formative years, you looked for a solution. Good work.", "NAH Completely agree. I\u2019m married and have ADHD. I write EVERYTHING I can down bc I will not remember until it\u2019s too late if I don\u2019t. \n\nI could see how she took it and that is understandable. I would try to frame it as a tool you have used to try to better yourself for your relationship. Tell her you reflected on yourself and didn\u2019t like what you saw. Then tried to do something to correct it so you could be a better partner. At least that\u2019s what I see from what I read.", "My memory is shit. I have a shared calendar with my husband so we can keep track of our lives. I tell my Alexa to remind me to do things like pay my water bill.\n\nHe would be absolutely touched if I used the calendar to help me remember to ask about events in his life. \n\nWhat you're doing is wonderful. Even being in a couple, it's easy to become self-absorbed. I'm sorry your wife is upset but hopefully the replies on here will help you and her. Good luck OP!", "Agreed with this, NAH. I think you had great intentions and honestly a good strategy for following through. For the future, I\u2019m not sure how you worded your reminders, but a reminder that just marks the date like \u201cJane\u2019s big meeting\u201d looks less robotic than \u201cAsk Jane about her big meeting\u201d. Telling her that you wanted to make sure to remember the important events in her life is sweet, whereas telling her you wanted to remember to ask about the important events in her life feels a bit odd.", "Right I agree the only thing is when he\u2019s forgetting major things like a painful (so i think major?) dental procedure.", "Is the wife really getting a pass for calling him a \"weird and off-putting\" and a \"full-blown asshole\" the instant she sees something she doesn't like?\n\nWhat's more, it's ON HIM to bring her to the table and gently explain himself until she can understand or forgive him?\n\nWhy is there zero culpability or examination of the wife's behavior?", "I agree 100%. My husband used to do the same thing. When I  was visiting his office once and saw the sticky notes (20 yrs ago), I actually thought it was cute. It actually became a joke- he would call to see how I was and I'd say...ah reading your sticky note. \nWe've been married over 42 years. He doesn't use notes anymore.", "If my ex had enough self awareness to make himself this accommodation, we might still be married.", "Honestly, I get why OPs wife was surprised and even felt a bit weird about it at first. I think I would feel the same way and it would probably take a day or so to feel normal about it. \nBut I would hope when that wears off she sees it as what it is; OP taking an action to help with a flaw he\u2019s perceived in himself so that he can support her better, as you said.", "THIS!  NTA.  I feel like I always remember at the worst time, like something I need to text someone but it\u2019s 11pm so I need to remember in the morning but that doesn\u2019t always happen. I will literally pack a bag I need for my day, put it right next to my keys at the front door, and two minutes later walk right by without grabbing it. \n\nI also have a habit of not following through on conversations. I am not diagnosed but suspect ADHD and/or autism, and when people try to chit chat with me, it just never occurs to me to ask questions back until later. A co-worker will ask how my weekend was, I\u2019ll tell them about it, and then just be like, have a great day!  Later on I\u2019ll think shoot, I should\u2019ve asked how THEIR weekend was too. I really don\u2019t think it\u2019s me being self-centered, just in the moment I don\u2019t think to ask, I just answer their question. I\u2019m working on this but it\u2019s tough because my brain just doesn\u2019t think \u201cthis conversation is a two way street, I need to ask a question back.\u201d", "Seriously, I have trouble remembering *my own* appointments and events without reminders; there's no f---ing way I can remember someone else's without them!", "I wonder if OP is mistaking self-centered with \"I have a lot of trouble remembering dates and events\" and thinks that means he's self-centered bc he's under the impression most ppl fon't also have the same struggle.", "Same. My husband has barely asked me anything about myself in months. He asked about a mutual friend (I'm closer to the friend than husband is) and I was frankly stunned because I'm used to him never asking about my work, hobbies, family, the results of my biopsy, etc.", "Same, I think I would cry tears of joy if I found out my husband did this. I know memory fails and things happen that are sometimes out of his control but to put the time to set reminders so he made sure I felt cared for? Sounds amazing", "I'm not married. But I do have this to contribute. We all get so busy, and we can't remember everything. We get so caught up in life, and some things just seem so routine. Sometimes we forget to breathe, and look around. It's easy to forget. There is so much shit going on all the fucking time.\n\nIdk start asking how they are doing. And then you can mention that'd you'd like it if they reciprocated and asked you (if they havent). I think we all need to do these small check ins. \n\nI don't have a s.o, so I'm just brainstorming.", "OPs wife sounds very unappreciative.

It's sad he'd put in so much effort for someone so ungrateful.", "You should add some of your own - see if he thinks they're originally his. \"Treat Aclysmic to a spa day\" or whatever else you'd like.

Reminders are a lifesaver.", "I was going to ask who told OP no one else does this. I do it.", "Maybe a year ago now, and I think the genders were reversed.  That was a good one.", "Lord knows that since I had my son, his medical issues, my medical issues, etc that even with the reminders, sometimes I have the \"Oh feces!\" realization that I had set and forgotten about something and had neglected to set the reminder far enough in advance to not panic.  Thankfully, for my son and my wife, it is usually my reminders for my own labs and dr appts., so, no one else is bothered.  LOL!", "It\u2019s not inauthentic.

The act of writing it seemed to help it stick in my brain. I need it less for my personal life now but the habitual note taking at work has been incredibly useful. \n\nNAH as far as I\u2019m concerned OP. You\u2019ve identified an area you need a toolkit for in order to be a more caring partner. Your SO may understandably feel a bit odd about it, but the intentions are good. Maybe you could frame it as the commenter above said - you are invested in the relationship and finding ways to do better in it, and the reminders are a tool that help you be more present and attentive.", "I\u2019m considering stealing this honestly. I already thought about putting all my friends birthdays in my calendar since I don\u2019t go on Facebook anymore and that\u2019s where I\u2019d see most of the birthday reminders but doing this for more things would make me and sounds like it makes OP a more considerate person. It\u2019s better than just forgetting. I have ADD and also I have to admit I am a bit like OP in that I am conscious that I can be inconsiderate at times and can be more wrapped up in my own stuff that I forget to stay up to date with friends and families events or whatever. This honestly sounds like OP is being very thoughtful in giving himself a tool as a reminder.", "Dang you just reminded me to pay the water bill thanks!", "She didn't call him a full blown asshole he said, i wouldn't say she thinks I'm a full blown asshole.", "Agreed. It is very ableist. And people who do come up with good coping strategies like this aren't believed because those strategies usually keep them organized...", "Exactly.  Not all of us have excellent memories. Sometimes we mix up dates. Sometimes we have so much going on life is about us. Sometimes like op said we just have never thought something was important before.  \n \nI love that your husband used sticky notes. It should be more common that we don\u2019t get offended at aids.

I have ADHD and if this is truly a memory issue to *that extent* OP should probably talk to a psychiatrist and look into medication. Dates / birthdays stuff like that I agree that reminders are totally fine and a tool for that type of neuroscience\\*.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOP could in fact have given himself an accurate evaluation, or it could even be a combo of the two.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: neuroscience?

If he forgets to ask me how I\u2019m doing (usually give it a few times) I gently remind him that i would appreciate it if he reciprocated.", "I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m ND but I forget that fast, too.", "It's the fact that OP said that they've been like this their entire life. Forgetting something once in a while is normal behavior. Forgetting most things, frequently, is not.   \n\n\nIt seems like you think that I was being insulting by suggesting that there's neurodivergence here, but that's not what I was trying to do. I have ADHD, and I have to rely on alarms and reminders on my electronic devices, as well as writing things down on a whiteboard and post-its. I belong to several ADHD subreddits and it's very common for all of us to talk about needing reminders for things.", "I find it so heartwarming and romantic that you care about her so deeply, you put in this effort and have adjusted your actions to a method that works for you so you can ensure she feels loved and appreciated. I don't know how she can't see how sweet this is! You know you're not someone who remembers things passively, but she is worth too much to you to forget so you've developed an entire system for this. Magnifique!", "I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re on the autism spectrum. Some I\u2019ve met who have been have had troubles with reaching out and asking how about how the other person has going. I think it\u2019s sweet that you\u2019re trying though.", "How what?", "I have adhd, and as well as adding \u201cFred\u2019s birthday is today\u201d to my diary, I also add \u201cBuy card for Fred\u201d 7-10 days before, and \u201cpost Fred\u2019s card\u201d 2-3 days before (for the friends that need or really appreciate cards).", "I also have ADHD and I do the same. I have birthdays, anniversaries etc and warnings set up for a few days before so I can panic shop.", "I am autistic and have adhd too, I have to do the same thing OP does for remembering pretty much anything whether it\u2019s from my life or someone else\u2019s! It helps a lot. OP is def not an A, it\u2019s sweet that he is putting in an effort to remember things so he can talk about them with his wife.", "As the ADHD person in my relationship with a partner who also feels the \"ahhhhhh\" I appreciate your understanding that it's not entirely his fault.", "I am not in a relationship nor do I have ADHD and I set calendar reminders of work stuff, friend stuff, family stuff, MY stuff. And since I live alone I can sync things to my Echo to hear it out loud. \n\nSuper helpful!", "No it isn\u2019t. That doesn\u2019t make sense. I don\u2019t even remember to eat some days without my calendar reminder, but I can still run a whole department and love my partner with the tools I\u2019ve put in place to keep me accountable. It\u2019s call neurodivergence, ass clown, and a sign that someone cares. They\u2019re actively identifying ways meet the others needs.", "How the heck does anyone survive without a calendar of events? I'm jealous of these people", "Exactly this. It\u2019s impossible for many people to possibly remember every detail. Honestly if there are important things and appointments coming up for your household whether it\u2019s a couple or also children etc. I find the best thing to do is a shared family calendar on paper so everyone can see it as well as add and subtract to it as things change. So much easier than each person having their own stuff in their phones where you may forget to check daily plus you don\u2019t know which things of yours can affect your partners schedules and vise versa. Of course you can each have your own private stuff on your own phone calendars and reminders.", "But Op didnt say that he forgets most things , he only has reminders to ask about important things going on in his wife\u2019s life. He doesn\u2019t describe any issues remembering the stuff that he needs to do ,his appointments , his deadlines . His issue seems different than poor memory or add, still I think it\u2019s good he self aware and that  hes found a system to make sure he\u2019s more attentive to his wife .", "i have had bad memory all my life. i have not been diagnosed, ever.", "No where did I say his wife called him self centered. \n\nBut her response sure did reinforce any negative feelings he may have had about himself.", "google calendar w/ a one week out reminder", "Wait. You\u2019re saying other people just REMEMBER about something going on that I told them about a month ago? Whenever someone remembers something important in my life I\u2019ve always thought to myself \u201cit\u2019s really sweet they cared enough to put this in their calendar.\u201d You\u2019re telling me people can do this WITHOUT calendar reminders? \ud83e\udd2f\n\nWhat else do people do without reminders!?!?", "Me, too. I have one layer of my Google calendar that's just for shit other people are doing that I want to check in with them about. It's a simple trick for helping me manage my brain issues.", "My parents were similar. Constant fights because they \u201cshouldn\u2019t have to ask\u201d but also wouldn\u2019t write it down where I might see it. I didn\u2019t get my adhd diagnosis until I sought it out myself in college.", "I think people point to neurodivergence for several reasons beyond needing the reminders:\n\n1. not being able to do things that \u201cnormal\u201d people can do is a key feature of neurodivergence. What OP did with the reminders is a form of masking. He learns what to do in social situation not because he inherently knows how, but because he\u2019s learned how to perform in a socially advantageous way.\n2. OP\u2019s reminder trick is something I\u2019ve heard recommended to people with ADHD and on the spectrum. By professionals. Op is clearly caring and smart.\n3. OP\u2019s is blaming their \u201cself-centredness\u201d on forgetting, but self-centred people are not this aware and kind. Unfortunately, people who are not the best at reading social cues/socializing are often labeled as self-centred, or arrogant by those who do not struggle with social cues.\n4. OP did not specify exactly how he was encouraged to be self centred as a child, but to me that sounds like he was a very smart child who got away with being undiagnosed through high achievement (like many neurodivergent people who are diagnosed in adulthood)\n\nThis post does not make OP neurodivergent, but  I think for neurodivergent people this story rings very close to home.", "man, as someone who spent years in horrible relationships with people who were actually abusive, this isn't it. \n\nall op says is that she was off-put by this, which is completely normal. i'd probably be a little confused to if i found out my partner did the same thing. she's allowed to have feelings and you making her out to be a terrible partner over it is quite frankly, laughable.\n\nshe was confused by behavior that is not typical. not once did op mention she \"manipulated him\" him into anything. my use of the term \"berate\" is no worse than your idiotic use of the term \"gaslight\" in this situation.", "No. Gaslighting is when you make someone doubt their perception of objective reality\u2014things like where objects in the house are kept, what was said in a conversation, what time events happen. \n\nShe is allowed to have an opinion, or an emotional response, to the things he does. And her response to this, as reported by OP, is mild confusion and consternation.", "Some people brush their teeth, drink enough water and take a shower on a regulare base without reminders.\n\nMindblowing.", "I hear you. In a shocking twist of events, my parents started telling me I should be setting personal reminders\u2026probably in my late teens IIRC. I\u2019ve tried to explain how their previous actions have made that difficult, and I think my dad understands, but I doubt my mom does.", "Aww, woe is you. \n\nJust because her actions aren't as bad as what you've experienced does not invalidate the fact that it was gaslighting all the same. \n\nHope you find someone who can handle your perpetual victimhood.", "I literally pulled that definition off Google, and it can be applied in the same way. \n\nWoman gaslit him. And sure, she's entitled to her ungrateful, ignorant opinions. She'll make everyone around her happy with that.", "I don't believe you. Poppycock.", "Thanks for reminding :).", "I have one too. Something's I'll remember, like where is that tool in my car (sometimes) but other times I'll forget even when actively thinking about it.", "Poppycock!", "PTSD here and I love this system.. i became very forgetful and sometimes self-centred because of it. I write a lot of notes reminding me to spend quality time as I have a habit of disappearing in my own head"]}
