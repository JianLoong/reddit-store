If so, how has your brother's behavior been at them?

You\u2019re going to cut him off and harm your family for a one off? \n\nYou\u2019re entitled to have whoever you want in your house but if this was a one off, it\u2019s harsh. Unless you update to say he\u2019s like this a lot YTA", "Does he have a habit of being drunk, making scenes and acting bad?", "NTA, but you should give your brother a chance to redeem himself... by making him the official Easter Bunny. Hear me out. He can dress up in a full bunny costume, complete with giant ears and fluffy tail. His job will be to hide eggs for the kids and hop around the yard, keeping the little ones entertained. He'll be too busy being the Easter Bunny to cause any trouble, and it'll make for a hilarious story in the future.\n\nIf he's genuinely sorry and wants to make amends, he'll be willing to put in the effort to make this year's gathering a success.

You chose to exclude him fully a year later because of said actions in spite of his apology.\n\nIt's your house, invite who you want. But don't act like you're not doing exactly what you're doing, holding a grudge.\n\nAnd the first offense was simply being present? Showing up 'unannounced' to the big family gathering tradition? Sure is a welcoming family tradition. And second offense was bringing his gf without introducing her to you beforehand? Say that out loud. Say 'I was upset that my brother brought his partner without my approval' out loud a few times. If my family felt entitled to a vote on whether or not my partner was allowed to accompany me to a gathering, I'd tell them to get fucked.\n\n\nHonestly this reads like the golden child is upset that the black sheep spoiled her day last year by merely existing, and she's still holding a grudge a year later. \n\nYTA", "NTA and your brother's reactions prove he's not ready. A person who was working on change would say, OK I understand, I will keep working on myself and maybe next year.

He\u2019s old enough to have never done this. Not like he was a teenager who had a lapse in judgment. \n\nIt we so bad that people left because of him. I\u2019m not inviting that back in my home. \n\nSomeone else can take that chance on a holiday. When he proves in someone else\u2019s home on the holiday  that he can behave like a responsible adult then I would consider letting him back in my home. \n\nApologies don\u2019t mean shit.

Seems like a easier option", "Agree. My brother (40s) did a similar thing at our Christmas get together. A semi-major ruckus was caused. He apologized to everyone and was hugely embarrassed the next day. \n\nWe aren't excluding him from future gatherings, but we mostly agreed to have alcohol-free gatherings in the future because our brother is more important to us than drinking. Bro has since decided on his own to quit drinking, but we'll do this either way, to support him in his abstinence or to prevent future ugly scenes. If he shows up drunk (has never happened), we'll deal with that then. Might have to turn him away if he arrives drunk, but that would be a decision based on his actions at the time, not on what he did at the Christmas party.", "I agree!", "Sorry but \u201cif you really want to be part of the family event, demean yourself more\u201d is not the reasonable stance you think it is.", "This is the way.", "I like that idea.", "Also post it online so he's fully humiliated.

Showed up unannounced (shock, gasps) and with his gf - *who OP had not been previously given an opportunity to approve or disapprove of beforehand* (cries of alarm, sounds of fainting people hitting the floor).\n\nHonestly the drinking part of the story feels like a fig leaf over a golden child being upset at a black sheep for being present. I've knocked over trays of food and fought with my dad stone cold sober. OP talks about how everyone was so upset last year, but nobody else seems to think it was a deeper problem and now she's upset that her judgment on the matter is being questioned.", "This is the way", "\"I know I didn't communicate any of this like an adult at any point during the past year, but he had an alcohol and didn't introduce us to his gf before he introduced us to his gf, so he doesn't deserve forgiveness\" is an absolutely wild stance for OP to take here.\n\nImmaturity doesn't want the negative association of being used to describe OP's attitudes.", "Because people think thisnis a revenge sub", "That's a lot of projection", "He got into a verbal altercation with a guest, knocked over a tray of food, and made so many inappropriate comments that some guests left.\nHe did far more than drink a bit and not introduce his gf.\nOP NTA", "Sure, and if she'd posted last year asking if she was the asshole for yelling at her brother, I'd agree with your judgment. But it's this year, and she's asking if she's the asshole for holding the grudge.\n\nShe's not the asshole for still being upset with her brother. She's the asshole for handling it like a conflict-avoidant selfish teenager instead of an adult who has a problem with a close family member.", "It isn\u2019t holding a grudge LOL it is holding people accountable. He made a scene last year and thus OP doesn\u2019t trust him and didn\u2019t invite him. Sounds like a FAAFO situation. He FA and he FO"]}
