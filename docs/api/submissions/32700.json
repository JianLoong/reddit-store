It\u2019s not your job to be buying take out for your sisters anyway even if you kindly often offer it to them.", "I love my kid brother, I'll start off by saying that. He's 8 years younger than me, and the quintessential extrovert cheeky l'il shit to my introvert book nerd.\n\nWe're both pretty smart, academically, and come from a family where academic prowess is valued. My aptitude lies in languages and his in numbers. I was pretty good when I chose to do French as an elective fourth language in 8th grade, and that was helped a lot by the kick ass after school tuition teacher I went to. Cut to when my brother hits 8th grade and I'm in university, and for whatever reason, he chooses to take French like I did \"because how hard can it be?\" and the tuition teacher I went to had retired and gone to the US to be with her son years ago. So I got roped in to tutor this pubescent kid who, because we never were at a relatively equal place in lives til he turned 22, was more or less a stranger I was related to and lived with in the same house. My instructions were: \"Teach him. Make him listen; you're his older sister. Discipline him if he disobeys you.\"\n\nWith the \"Teach him\" part, the implication was that his marks in the exams would reflect on me. That I did a good job because he did a good job and if he didn't get good marks, it's because, idk, I wanted him to fail or I didn't teach him well enough or I wasn't good at French after all or something.\n\nWith the \"Make him listen to what you say,\" it was like being set up to fail because he didn't get anything like \"Listen to your sister and do what she tells you\" so he just kept ducking out whenever I tried to get him to sit down and teach him. So obviously, me being the older sister, I should have been able to exert control/command his attention with zero guidance and experience and because I couldn't, I got an ass chewing.\n\nThe discipline part is tragically hilarious because we're South Asian. I got slapped across the face, pinched in the ribs, my ear twisted, my back and arms and thighs thumped, whacked with a wooden rolling pin, etc in the name of discipline by my parents over the course of my childhood and teenage years and even into my early 20s so obviously that was the only thing I knew to do even if it icked me out (I knew how it feels being on the receiving end, so why would I inflict that on someone else?). My brother got his share of \"discipline\" from them too. But\u2014and I think I did this subconsciously because I knew it was wrong but I also didn't know what else I was supposed to do to \"discipline\" my brother when he would get up to scamper away when we sat down for a tutor sesh\u2014when I slapped my brother's forearm and thigh (I promise you it was half-hearted and I still feel the ick from choosing to do that) in front of my mother, she gave me that specific combo of fake cheeky grin and angry mom eyes and told me that that's not how I should be disciplining my widdle bby bwudder \ud83d\ude44 and I should use my words and not my hands \ud83d\udc80 and I wasn't being a good older sister and teacher and is this how I was going to treat my children when they were naughty? \ud83d\ude43\ud83d\ude43\ud83d\ude43\n\nAt that point, maybe a month into the first year of his French language study, I gave up and said I can't do this if you're going to block my every move without giving me guidance on what to do or support by backing up my authority in this matter over my brother. Apparently that was backtalk. Words were exchanged. Core memories wrought. \n\nApart from things like that, because we lived pretty much separate lives because of our age gap and interests, there was very little that could be brought on my head that I didn't do to protect him or prevent him from doing once he outgrew toddlerhood, and by the time we were both adults, he matured nicely and had reached the point where having someone else take the blame for his screw ups would only make sense if my parents were in need of medical care for impaired cognition. They're still kicking around and doing benignly stupid shit with all their mental faculties intact so I can't say they're wilfully malicious these days."]}
