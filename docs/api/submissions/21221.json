When I bought our current house, it had 4 bedrooms, I later renovated the basement to add another 2 bedrooms. My wife and I have 1 room, the 3 teenagers had a room each, and the youngers boys share the other 2 rooms (with various configurations over the years). As the younger boys get older things are going to get more cramped for them and we haven't ruled out having more kids. I also don't want to immediately take my older kid\u2019s rooms away the second they go to college (and maybe they'll stay local or no go at all), because of this I started looking at how I would add more bedrooms.\n\n\r  \nThe property our house is on is a little under 1 acre. Last year I decided I would build a den in the backyard that could become the older boys\u2019 bedrooms. The build was finished a few weeks ago and the boys have moved in. They have a small shared living space that includes a kitchenette, a shared bathroom, and they each have their own rooms. It's essentially a tiny house in our yard. They boys love it, and we had a lot of fun working on the build together. \n\n\r  \nMy ex-wife, however, is less than pleased with the boys new living arrangements. She has multiple safety concerns as she thinks they are too far away if something happens and that they will feel like they could get away with whatever as I can't monitor them well. She also thinks it's unfair they will have to walk through a yard to get to and from their bedrooms to the house even in adverse weather conditions. She feels as though I'm pushing the boys away by housing them in the backyard and that it suggests I'm prioritising my new family, while at the same time thinking giving them a cool den in the backyard is favoring them over their sister. \n\n\r  \nI think her biggest issue is the one she didn't mention, which is worrying the boys will want to spend even more time at my house if they have more privacy and great place to hang with their friends. We no longer split custody based on our custody agreement and for the last few years the boys have lived the majority of the time with me, where as our daughter alternates between our houses every 2 weeks.\n\n \r  \nMy ex is trying to make it out like I'm a massive asshole in this situation, but I really don't feel like I am.

And they will probably overstepping any rules you have regarding bed time maaaany times. And you know what? You will scold them, you will have serious talks with them, you will turn a blind eye on them because you know that this is part of growing up. Not many parents have the luxury that their kids can make their first experiences of adulthood in the safety of their backyard. Most kids turn 18 and suddenly have to be an adult with not knowing how to organise themselves. That's why the first year of college/university is so hard for a lot of students.

They will either live alone (if they can effort it) or share an apartment with strangers they only know from the Internet. Also, teenagers always have their ways to sneak out. You can either give them the opportunity to have a party on your property where you can set some rules or they will drink their first booze in the middle of a forest with people they don't know and absolutely no rules. You can also either give them the chance to have their first gf over and have a proper talk to both of them before anything happens or you have to live with the possibility that your kid has their first time in some rusty car in the middle of nowhere (and no contraception because keeping condoms in your parents car is risky and 'what could go wrong?'). OP has the possibility for a great how-to-be-an-adult-training-centre.

It is incredibly easy if your parents won't see you that evening or 1st thing the next morning.\n\n\"The kids are going to do stuff\" is a great argument for making sure your kids are educated on consequences and how to spot dangerous situations, not assuming your kids are perfect, not clamping down on them b/c you just can't protect them from everything, not blindly believing your kids are telling you everything, understanding that them not telling you everything is perfectly OK and normal, instilling in them their safty is more important to you than them dissapointing you and to not freak out if they are caught doing pretty typical stuff.\n\nBut that argument doesn't = let free of the reigns.\n\nIt is so easy to underestimate just being around your kids everyday and knowing their daily routine allows a parent to know what is going on in a kids life, even if they are sneaky and even if they don't say much.

Let\u2019s say for example that we want to work on fixing hunger in the world - to a large extent that requires a reallocation of resources. Assuming the people who have resources even want to share them (which is a big assumption since history tends to show people hoarding goods and wealth instead of sharing with strangers) the cost environmentally of shipping the food either over the oceans on ships (with huge pollution issues, introduction of invasive species, and an increase in ocean noise that is harming many species) or through the air with planes (huge consumption of fuel) is astronomical. That\u2019s not to say we shouldn\u2019t look at ways of fixing food scarcity, but it indicates that reallocating resources isn\u2019t necessarily easy. If we try to change more land to farmland, that also harms biodiversity. Plus, as humans expand into wild areas, animals just being animals quickly become \u201cpests\u201d. I immediately think of wolves being exterminated in much of the world just for eating prey species we accumulated all in one spot. \n\nThe racism aspect is complicated, but what you\u2019ve listed (look at a map and see where the highest populations are) seems like it\u2019s reaching a racism conclusion too quickly. Those places may have higher birth rates because of a whole host of racist reasons (colonization, resource exploitation, racism in the West, etc.) but that doesn\u2019t mean that concern about the human population going from 2 billion in 1930 to 8 billion in 2022 is a racist concern. \n\nI\u2019ll have to look into it more though, I want to make sure my environmental concerns take environmental justice into account as much as possible", "Pretty sure people concerned about overpopulation tend to also be concerned about over consumption. Pretty wild that you attribute that to racism.\n\nBill Gates funding sterilisation campaigns cos of racism? That's going off the deep end.", "Agreed. I've been hearing about this a lot lately so I'm surprised some people didn't know. The falling birth rate could actually have repercussions for the economy, especially social safety nets.

Quality of life in that hypothetical would also likely be pretty awful. \n\nI realize it\u2019s a reference point, but even in a less literal sense, people tend to want to expand and control more, so absent a chance in human nature, the mass relocation of populations or the perfection or transporting and redistributing resources seems more like idealized sci-fi than an achievable policy goal - at least in the short term. \n\nThe human population getting smaller seems more achievable, especially since more and more people are choosing to live non-traditional lifestyles that don\u2019t focus on reproduction.
