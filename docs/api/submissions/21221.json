When I bought our current house, it had 4 bedrooms, I later renovated the basement to add another 2 bedrooms. My wife and I have 1 room, the 3 teenagers had a room each, and the youngers boys share the other 2 rooms (with various configurations over the years). As the younger boys get older things are going to get more cramped for them and we haven't ruled out having more kids. I also don't want to immediately take my older kid\u2019s rooms away the second they go to college (and maybe they'll stay local or no go at all), because of this I started looking at how I would add more bedrooms.\n\n\r  \nThe property our house is on is a little under 1 acre. Last year I decided I would build a den in the backyard that could become the older boys\u2019 bedrooms. The build was finished a few weeks ago and the boys have moved in. They have a small shared living space that includes a kitchenette, a shared bathroom, and they each have their own rooms. It's essentially a tiny house in our yard. They boys love it, and we had a lot of fun working on the build together. \n\n\r  \nMy ex-wife, however, is less than pleased with the boys new living arrangements. She has multiple safety concerns as she thinks they are too far away if something happens and that they will feel like they could get away with whatever as I can't monitor them well. She also thinks it's unfair they will have to walk through a yard to get to and from their bedrooms to the house even in adverse weather conditions. She feels as though I'm pushing the boys away by housing them in the backyard and that it suggests I'm prioritising my new family, while at the same time thinking giving them a cool den in the backyard is favoring them over their sister. \n\n\r  \nI think her biggest issue is the one she didn't mention, which is worrying the boys will want to spend even more time at my house if they have more privacy and great place to hang with their friends. We no longer split custody based on our custody agreement and for the last few years the boys have lived the majority of the time with me, where as our daughter alternates between our houses every 2 weeks.\n\n \r  \nMy ex is trying to make it out like I'm a massive asshole in this situation, but I really don't feel like I am.

And they will probably overstepping any rules you have regarding bed time maaaany times. And you know what? You will scold them, you will have serious talks with them, you will turn a blind eye on them because you know that this is part of growing up. Not many parents have the luxury that their kids can make their first experiences of adulthood in the safety of their backyard.
