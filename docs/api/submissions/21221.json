When I bought our current house, it had 4 bedrooms, I later renovated the basement to add another 2 bedrooms. My wife and I have 1 room, the 3 teenagers had a room each, and the youngers boys share the other 2 rooms (with various configurations over the years). As the younger boys get older things are going to get more cramped for them and we haven't ruled out having more kids. I also don't want to immediately take my older kid\u2019s rooms away the second they go to college (and maybe they'll stay local or no go at all), because of this I started looking at how I would add more bedrooms.\n\n\r  \nThe property our house is on is a little under 1 acre. Last year I decided I would build a den in the backyard that could become the older boys\u2019 bedrooms. The build was finished a few weeks ago and the boys have moved in. They have a small shared living space that includes a kitchenette, a shared bathroom, and they each have their own rooms. It's essentially a tiny house in our yard. They boys love it, and we had a lot of fun working on the build together. \n\n\r  \nMy ex-wife, however, is less than pleased with the boys new living arrangements. She has multiple safety concerns as she thinks they are too far away if something happens and that they will feel like they could get away with whatever as I can't monitor them well. She also thinks it's unfair they will have to walk through a yard to get to and from their bedrooms to the house even in adverse weather conditions. She feels as though I'm pushing the boys away by housing them in the backyard and that it suggests I'm prioritising my new family, while at the same time thinking giving them a cool den in the backyard is favoring them over their sister. \n\n\r  \nI think her biggest issue is the one she didn't mention, which is worrying the boys will want to spend even more time at my house if they have more privacy and great place to hang with their friends. We no longer split custody based on our custody agreement and for the last few years the boys have lived the majority of the time with me, where as our daughter alternates between our houses every 2 weeks.\n\n \r  \nMy ex is trying to make it out like I'm a massive asshole in this situation, but I really don't feel like I am. However, in the past I haven't always known when I have been an asshole so maybe I'm missing something.

Just make sure you go into their den regularly, that you maintain clear rules for guests, that you follow through on chores and other thing, etc. \n\nFor custody concerns: it's good coparenting practice with teenagers to encourage them to spend time at their mom's. Have open conversations with them about the importance of that relationship, especially as they get close to adulthood. Listen to any concerns they have and make sure you're not falling into fun dad territory.

You spent a lot of time on that house which shows you paid a lot of attention to your teens. I actually think you're being a great father because now they'll learn independence and how to care for themselves before they are adults.\n\nYour ex-wife is jealous and it really shows.

And I would consider getting a motion sensitive camera like Blink to put outside the cabin. Let your ex have access to the account (it's $10 a month) for her peace of mind. \n\nThe camera would only be for around the outside so you can see when the boys leave and enter.

If you've become more casual with it then she's probably justified in feeling like the kids are pulling away from her, especially if they have a cool new hangout. Talk to your kids about making more time for their mom and possibly address her concerns with them. Have they told her they feel pushed out in favor of your younger kids, or is your ex projecting?

What could go wrong?\n\nSeriously, dude? Your ex has legitimate concerns here and you are ridiculously putting down to just jealousy w/o addressing her ACTUAL concerns.\n\nI promise, this idea is incredibly short sighted. I can tell you stories of the stuff my friends and I got up to in a similar situation, and it isn't pretty. Our parents were completely unaware we b/c all got good grades and showed up for dinner when required. We were 12-16 when this stuff was going down.\n\nI am 100% in belief that kids should have more privacy and independence than a lot of the parenting styles I currently see, but this is just a terrible idea.\n\nYou have room in the house for them now and you could have moved the oldest into the extra space once he graduated HS. Then lather, rinse, repeat as the kids get older. There was absolutely no reason to move them out there now and no reason to move either of them now unless there are issues w/ your boys and their step-mom/new kids that you are hiding.\n\nI'm just not buying your tale of needing room RIGHT NOW for kids you don't yet have and I don't blame your ex for not buying that tale either.\n\nYTA.", "NTA - its your house, you can do what you want.", "Yta - don't have 8 kids ...", "NTA.

If the kids were older, say 18 to 21,  I'd say you were good, but at this young age, not having them in the house at night is not a great idea.  There are too many things that can happen to young boys unsupervised, especially if it gets to be well known that they are alone at night.  There are way too many bad people in this world who would relish a chance to get at young unsupervised kids plus unsupervised teenagers have a way of looking for mature things to do.
