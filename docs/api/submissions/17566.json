Interrupting people midsentence is a horrible habit. It can cause unintended negative perceptions about a person from friends, family, co-workers, and employers.

That's dreadful. Does she really have depression or does she mostly like drama and storming around and lashing out?

Are you under a mental health team? Maybe they could help. There might also be some charities or social group who could advise you.", "I really have to get out of here, lol. I have a psychiatrist I see quarterly for prescription refills but unfortunately the way it works over here is if your insurance won\u2019t cover it you are basically screwed unless you are wealthy. We are well above the median household income so won\u2019t qualify for any sort of charity (and I actually have a pretty good insurance plan believe it or not). Sometimes if feels like your insurance decides what care you will get instead of your doctor\u2026. I\u2019ll ask what it would cost next time, hopefully it\u2019s just the cost of a few consultations which I know cost $450/hr without insurance.", "NTA.\n\nI have ADHD and I interrupt people *constantly*. I hate that about myself, but I don't even realize I'm doing it, which has made it basically impossible to stop. I get excited and my mouth starts moving before I make a conscious decision to speak. \n\nI'm getting better about noticing when I do it-- cutting myself off and apologizing to the person, but I've yet to manage to stop myself beforehand a single time. (At least not the first time in an interaction. If I get embarrassed about it once during a conversation the anxiety over it sometimes helps me keep it at bay the rest of the time.)\n\nIf someone called me out though? First off, I wouldn't be mad, I'd be ashamed. Second, the heightened emotions/awareness might actually allow me to stop doing so for a while, so I'd consider it a win overall.\n\nYour sister may not be in control of this behavior, but she *is* in control of her reactions, and she reacted wrong.", "Nta. But one thing I have learned is when people interrupt I just keep talking and talking.

Still worth the diagnosis though.", "Testing? Often ADHD diagnoses are made by psychiatrists, typically with input from other psych professionals. My therapist (a licensed clinical social worker) diagnosed me and the psychiatrist asked me a bunch of questions to confirm her diagnosis, got me started on meds, and then passed medication management off to my primary care. I never had to do any form of testing.\n\nWhat insurance do you have? I wouldn't take your doctor's word for it, it's unlikely they know the ins and outs of every insurance plan from every insurer they take.", "The questions are the testing. Hopefully it would just be at my doctors hourly rate, but I\u2019d have to get with billing ahead of time I\u2019m betting. Insurance covers my normal hour with him but anything outside of that would have to be approved, and since adult onset ADHD isn\u2019t officially recognized yet, it is unlikely they will cover it (according to my doctor).", "I'm very confused by the idea of \"adult onset ADHD\". Just because no one documented your symptoms as a child doesn't mean they weren't there. If they ask you about childhood symptoms, can you not honestly tell them that the same symptoms you have now were always present?", "I\u2019ve been told if there was nothing documented in childhood, insurance won\u2019t pay for any testing as an adult. My current visits are billed under a certain billing code the insurance covers. If we do anything else, like the questionnaires, it gets billed under a different code, that they will most likely reject. It\u2019s the same with the annual physical. It\u2019s covered, but if you discuss something else the doctors office may add another billing code that the insurance company might kick back. I\u2019ve never had that happen but my husband did. He did have crap insurance at the time, but it is a thing that happens. They will absolutely not pay for anything they can get away with not paying for.\n\nETA: the billing code they added to my husbands physical was a consult code because he asked about other things which make it more than an annual physical apparently."]}
