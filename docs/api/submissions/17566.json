Embarrassingly, I too have the horrendous habit of sometimes interrupting. My mother does it all the time, and you'd think since I hate it done to me, I wouldn't do it myself.

Uh-uh, no, your sister needs to be called out immediately until she stops.

Could they have ADHD? I have ADHD (which was undiagnosed for years) and was having the same difficulty, it did hurt when someone got cross at me and pointed it out to me, but in the long term it actually really help me.", "NTA, your sister isn't entitled that everyone needs to listen to her, good for calling her out, maybe if more of your family members do she'll finally stop", "NTA \n\n>My step dad doesn't think calling people out makes anything better and usually escalates the situation.\n\nLetting them get away with everything only encourages them to continue with their poor behaviour.", "NTA. it's important to set boundaries and you were doing so. they aren't listening to you when you talk so they keep interrupting you and so you have to keep reminding them. \n\nalso just because it's her birthday week doesn't mean she's allowed to be rude. she seems to be rude no matter when it is.", "NTA. Interrupting someone is so rude even if it's not done mid-sentence but even mid-story. I just stop telling my story and refuse to continue it even if they ask. I also refuse to listen to the interrupter I just start looking at my phone or something similar.", "NTA. I say this as someone who interrupts all the time.  My mom and sisters and I just walk all over each other.  We\u2019ve always done it.  It\u2019s drives my husband absolutely insane.  It\u2019s something he will say, \u201cI was talking let me finish\u201d or something along those lines.  I\u2019ve gotten much better and I realize how annoying it can be.", "So they\u2019ve infantilized your sister and expect you to put up with the shit show they\u2019ve created? Hard no. \n\nHolding people accountable for their actions (aka \u201ccalling people out\u201d) is how they learn to function independently and contribute positively to society. Your stepdads views on it not helping is the reason your sister is a little shit with no accountability. \n\nNTA and keep blessing your sister with opportunities to be held accountable by calling her out. Eventually she will understand that when she interrupts you, her feelings are gonna get hurt and she will stop interrupting you. Stay consistent, then say \u201cI guess it DOES work\u201d to your stepdad when he witnesses it.", "Our family has this annoying habit as well when we are all together. It\u2019s definitely annoying... I think most families have things that annoy each other. \n\nHonestly, families tend to be rude with one another because they can get away with it. Corrections made in anger tend to result in more anger. I try to avoid that... \n\nMy solution is to just stop talking until the person that interrupts is done talking & then continue speaking to the other people like nothing happened.\n\nNTA \u2014 but I agree with your stepdad... conversations often organically happen with people jumping in with interruptions. Taking a hard line of no one ever gets to interrupt me ... may actually escalate the situation. Try not to match rude with rude. No one ever wins.", "INFO- you mentioned family and friends talk about hoe obnoxious it is but has anyone actually every had a conversation with your Mom and sister about it?

You should always call out bad behavior.", "NTA but the fact is your family is enabling her so dont expect it to change anytime soon if ever", "I imagine a lot of people will point out this can be a symptom of ADHD, and that's totally true; but it isn't an excuse. It's definitely okay to set boundaries with people about how they are treating YOU. Part of struggling with a disability, unfortunately, is learning to adapt in the world--it isn't your fault, but it's your responsibility. \n\nAlso wtf 26-year-old has a birthday WEEK where the rule is that they get to steamroll everyone else's conversations? NTA.", "NTA hit them with the \"oh I'm sorry did the middle of my sentence interrupt the beginning of yours?\" Keep embarrassing them", "NTA. My family would do this when I was growing up. Always interrupting....so I would just stop talking. Then they would ask me to repeat what I was going to say and I would say \"Nope, I'm done.\" and walk away.", "I know that she is really immature but everyone in my family encourages me to accept the fact that she is immature because she is the baby of the family. She still lives at home and doesn't pay rent/ utilities.", ">Your sister is way too old to have a \"birthday week\".\n\nOnly if someone is doing it for you. About half the time I take my birthday week off and just do whatever.", "I caught myself doing it to my wife recently. \"Finishing each other's sentences\" is always seen as romantic, but recently I realised it can also be very annoying; especially if I guess wrong!", "I really appreciate this insight. It's really mature of you and admirable that you are working on changing a difficult habit.", "> ADHD\n\nhuh. I recently realised I interrupt too much, I also have been noting a lot of things making me suspect adhd. I'll throw this on the pile. \n\nCan I ask: did having a diagnosis *help*? What change did it make, or allow you to make? I'm 60 and I can't help thinking it's not especially useful to know now I'm out of school", "I don't know if they have adhd. I don't think so because my mom is a teacher with degrees in child psychology. She works to diagnose adhd so I think she would have caught that if my sister or her had it. My sister does struggle with depression though. She says that is the reason for alot of things and I worry she will never grow up because my mom will always coddle her.", "Well that is certainly true.", "The problem is I wasn't even talking to her. I was having a conversation with my step dad who was really engaged and not interrupting at all. This habit of interrupting bothers him too. Sometimes he will say things like, \"I'm really trying to hear the rest of what .... has to say.\"", "I agree. The problem is, if I let her finish and restart my sentence, she interrupts me at the same spot saying the same thing. She repeats herself like a parrot and I can never finish a sentence. I don't know the best way to proceed with that. I need a way to go about this that isn't rude.", "Everyone complains behind their backs. I try to be honest and upfront with them.  I have told them that alot of people talk about how much they interrupt and how ride it is. My mom and sister do not believe me.", "Thank you for your honesty. I really appreciate it. I do not expect to change. I just don't want to be an asshole when I deal with it.", "I think the expectation is that \"birthday week\" people almost always expect everyone to cater to them for the whole week, or month,  or whatever.  \n\nTaking a week off for your birthday to do your own thing and not expecting everyone to give you special birthday treatment all week is totally fine!", "So I was diagnosed at 29, in my fifth year of my PhD. It's helped SO MUCH. Not just with school and work stuff either; it's helped with literally everything. I understand myself and my experiences so much better now. Knowing some of the underlying causes helps me manage the issues -- stuff like being super time blind (always late!), ADHD paralysis (literally being frozen in the spot when you need to do something), and in a related example, constantly interrupting. \n\nAlso, the medication has made my life a million times easier. My brain is QUIET for first time ever. I didn't know how unsettled it was untill suddenly it wasn't.", "I was diagnosed in my late 30s. It really helped understand myself better, understand others better to.  I also find it useful as a short hand to explain to people why I sometimes struggles, and once i can explain, people are more tolerant towards my quirks. They understand that I am just not being rude. It is genetic so it could help younger members of your family gets support quicker if they present the same symptoms.", "She might not be aware or just in denial, plus ADHD can present differently pending on which symptoms is more pronounced. It could also be any number of other autistic spectrum disorders or none at all of course and just the way they communicate. Your sister's symptoms might also be mild or she could hide some quite well. If your mum is the same (particularly if she has ADHD), it might seem just normal to them.  All I am saying is that it might be worth a thought.", "You have to join your forces and stand up for each other. Also going to another room and shutting the door at the face of the interrupters might help.\n\nThe problem is that these people really don't realise how rude and annoying they are...", "I just keep talking. As if the interrupting person isnt talking. Increasing my volume if needed. I completely ignore their rudeness. If they keep talking I will often change position to put my back to them while facing the person I am talking to and keep talking. When they get upset at MY rudeness I simply say it was rude to interrupt in the first place then go on ignoring them. It often pisses them off but then they get better at shutting up in the middle of a sentance.", "Simple \u201cI want to give you my full attention. Let me just finish this conversation then my ears will be all yours & ready to listen\u201d\n\neta \u2014 often our kids (25,25,27,29) will interrupt with some earth shattering information they just remembered but everyone needs to know immediately so we ask if they need to cut the line or if their news can wait.", "Ah well that explains a lot then. If no one other than you have never said anything about it then of course they're not going to believe you and just think you're being rude. You're NTA for calling them out but you will NEVER get anywhere if you are the only one that is addressing this issue with them", "It seems you had it bad.\n\n>My brain is QUIET\n\noh god that sounds just wonderful. OK you convinced me, I'm going to see if I can get a diagnosis. I weep for my wasted 60 years that could have been easier, but nobody knew better back then, the treatment for ADHD symptoms when I was at school was punishment.\n\nTHANK YOU"]}
