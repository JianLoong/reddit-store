I only exist because of my dad doing something bad, and my grandparents finding out about me and telling my mom they would never financially support her again if she did anything to me. So, basically, my mom has never loved me, and she's always tried to make sure I knew that what I am is terrible. I get it, and I know what happened to her was terrible, and I know I shouldn't exist, but it just sucks.\n\nThe thing is, my grandparents pay her because of me. They paid in full for housing, and for mom's medical school, and for me to be in daycare for most of my childhood. Mom is a doctor now, but she's just starting out, and my stepdad doesn't make enough money to make up for what my grandpa sends every month to help out. He's a surgeon, and he's probably the richest person I know. Because of the money, I'm in private school and I have nice clothes and I'm not starved and I don't get everything my half-siblings get but I know I'm more privileged than most people. My half siblings and parents also benefit from the money, and when I first asked to live with my grandparents, my mom called me selfish and said that they would stop paying for things and her \"real\" children would suffer because I was as selfish as my dad. I'm not allowed to talk to my grandparents usually unless my mom is in the room. \n\nAbout four months ago now, I got a message from my dad, and he said now that I'm 14, he wants to have a relationship. I agreed. My mom doesn't really keep track of where I'm going, so it was pretty easy to get away and start meeting up with him, and the first time we met he took me out for ice cream and I honestly cried because he seemed like he actually cared about me.\n\nEventually, I told him everything, and how my mom treats me, and he seemed pretty broken up about it. He just got this look on his face that it's hard to describe, and he hugged me for a long time and just let me cry and told me that he was the terrible one, not me, and that he would take me away from there in a second if I asked. He has money, and he helped me reached out to my grandparents and we had a meet up together and I told them everything. They helped me leave a month ago, and stopped paying my mom anything.\n\nIt's so, so much better at my Dad's house. He and his wife are actually nice to me, and my half-sister is really cool. I feel loved for the first time in my life. He even made up a song with my name, and he sings it all the time. Everything is going so much better, but my mom called me yesterday and yelled at me because she found out she can't afford private school for my siblings anymore. She says I betrayed her, that I'm a monster, and that she gave up her bones to make my body and gave up her freedom to raise me, and it just went on and on for hours and I never meant to hurt my siblings, I just wanted to live somewhere I felt loved.

That punchingbag is you. And she dangles control over you (i will be poor if you leave bla bla bla) to keep her punchingbag from leaving. She made you a thing and you internalized these Feelings. It is what children do, they internalize what they are being told. You have been told that you deserve tl be a punching bag. Your fucked-up upbringing will cause you GREAT harm your life. You need therapy. And you need to get out from under your mothers Boot. She is hardcore-bullying you from day 1. Running away was the first good step. Now have child protection Services involved. A third Party that is in your corner (!!!). And someone who keeps an eye on the whole thing.\n\nI cannot say anything about your father, since you let out the Details. Be a bit suspicious maybe, he was away after all and comes back now that you are 14 and starting to become a woman.

It sounds like your mother was r***d, but also your mother lied to you and gaslit you your whole life. She is also not a very credible source). \n\nYou often say your mother convinced you you should not have beem born since you werent a child of true love or whatever.

That is all that is involved. Feelings, relationship and all that have nothing to do with it, it is a purely physical act based on bodychemistry and biology. People get pregnant after one night stand when a Conndom had a hole, when they had group-s*x and were too drunk to use protection or whenever. These children exist and become adults just as anyone Else. So that whole argument is bollocks anyway. The older you get, the more you will realize that it is your choices that matter, and choices one has to be responsible for. And your mother chose to abuse you. She could have accepted you, aborted you, loved you or Set you up for Adoption. She Was a grown ass woman and couldve told her parents to go to hell when they coerced her for whatever reason. She didnt. Instead she chose to make your life a living hell. She is a monster. She took the path that was easiest for her and let you oay the price over and over again. She is to blame. All the adults are to blame. You are not to blame, because you had no choice in the matter. You are a victim.\n\nEverybody said it already: your parents Set you in the World. It is their responsibility to care for your well-being, not the other way around. You are a victim that has been fed the lie to be the perpetrator. \n\nGo to the police. Go to child Services. Stay with your dad (but be suspicious, you are starving for love, dont give it too easy.he has a lot of explaining to do and trust to to build. He sounds like a good guy - he could also be manipulating you, giving someone dying of thirst a glass of water makes everyone look like jesus all of a sudden [could also be he is genuine?]). You need someone on your sides that looks out for your best interests!!!!

Everything Else is not right now (including some fancy Private school - education is important, but not the be all end all). Your mothers financial security in her f*cked up relationship with your f*cked up grandparents is not your concern. \nThe first step would be to stop parrotting these words from your mother that you did not deserve to be born.

And it was not fair she put that pressure on an innocent child. Hate her parents? Sure. Hate your Dad? Sure. Hate you? No. None of this is your fault and I get she's traumatised (supposedly) but making you her punching bag is the worst thing she could have done. You're not her meal ticket. I can't say it loud enough. YOU ARE INNOCENT. YOU ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR OTHER PEOPLE'S DECISIONS RESULTING IN YOUR EXISTENCE. Do yourself a favour and break out of this headspace and live the life you were given on your own terms. You've paid whatever debt your mother thinks you owe her, and it was never your debt to pay. If you're happy with your dad I just hope that he is a better person than he was and deserves a relationship with you.", "Can I message you please? I've never met anyone else like me before.", "As a mother and a victim of rape that resulted in a pregnancy, I just want to give you a huge hug. \n\nWhile what happened to me was absolutely horrible, it in no way was my child's fault. \n\nNO CHILD ASKS TO BE BORN. YOU DID NOT HAVE A CHOICE. YOUR MOTHER DID. \n\nAnd your mother trying to blame you for the results of your father's actions is disturbing. \n\nI was raised in a fundy cult, so to abort would mean getting cut off from my entire family. I chose to stay. That was my choice. In making that choice, I also chose to love my child. And do the best I could for her. \n\nYour mother USED you as a meal ticket to support her other children that she also chose to have. You did no more damage to your mother's body than her other children. \n\nHer rationale falls apart for any adult. It's only because you have been subjected to emotional abuse from infancy that you believe what she says. \n\nPlease, please, please try to talk to a therapist, if you can't talk, show them this post. \ud83d\udc95", "Nobody deserves to be alive. That's not relevant.", "My mother was like yours in that she wanted to abort but was not able to. You do NOT owe her. You did not ask to be born, and you\u2019ve done NOTHING wrong. Sending you strength.", "Absolutely", "Thank you."]}
