It's a speech delay from a 6 y/o. Not say, a 20 y/o being an ass to deliberately make your BF uncomfortable. He's a little kid, not doing this deliberately to hurt anyone.

His attitude is kind of gross.", "NTA- Not by a long shot!\n\n\nYou shouldn't even need to come here to ask this.\n\nA six year old that has autism mixing words up and getting things wrong needs more understanding on your bf's part!", "Definitely NTA!

Little kids can be hard to deal with sometimes!\n\nSo can neurodiverse people, and I say that being on the spectrum myself. I'd say that if he kept it together until you were alone, he's alright. He may have just had a long day.", "NTA- Damn, he's almost 30 and acting this way? He's less mature than your brother.", "NTA and like others have said, this overreaction is pretty concerning.

He said or did nothing rude to your brother but in the car he wanted to vent but you shut him down hard, which you can do, but it's probably not really about your brother but about him not feeling accepted\n\njust something to consider", "OP, I didn't know your little brother had a twin.
