I've been planning this for about a month, and I picked the ring a couple weeks ago. The one I got was on sale, so I managed to get it at a surprisingly low price.\n\nLast weekend, I told my brother (33M) about my plans, and showed him the ring. He informed me that he was proposing to his girlfriend (29F) as well.\n\nThe next day, my brother came to my apartment while my girlfriend was out. He asked me if he could \"borrow\" my ring to propose to his girlfriend.\n\nI thought he was joking at first, but no. His plan was to propose to his girlfriend, explain he was using my ring as a \"placeholder\" and then take her to pick her own ring later. His reasoning was that he didn't want to spend too much money right away in case she didn't say yes. I'd never heard of \"placeholder rings\", so I said no and the conversation moved on.\n\nOn Tuesday, he proposed to his girlfriend. With my ring. He'd taken it before leaving my apartment. I got distracted at work and didn't notice it was gone until his fianc\u00e9e sent a picture of herself wearing the ring to our family group chat.\n\nI called him to ask about the ring, and he immediately apologized and said he'd \"keep his promise\" and give it back to me. But at this point, my girlfriend had seen it and his fianc\u00e9e had posted about it on social media, so it was pointless for me to propose using the same ring.\n\nWe fought about it, and he confessed that while he'd told his fianc\u00e9e the ring was a placeholder, he didn't tell her where he'd gotten it from.\n\nI felt more angry and betrayed about him going behind my back and taking the ring after I said no than the fact that he stole it. I also know his fianc\u00e9e enough to know she wouldn't like to learn her engagement ring had been stolen from me, so I told my brother I'd tell her the truth if he didn't buy me a new engagement ring.\n\nHe fought against it for a few hours, but finally gave up and agreed. We went to a different jewelry store yesterday, and I picked a new ring. I managed to stay in the price range, but the new one was still $100 more expensive.\n\nMy brother bought the ring, but is still accusing me of being inconsiderate and childish. He is insistent he would have given me the ring back had I given him the opportunity, and I didn't need to threaten him to spend so much money on me. He's now refusing to talk to me.\n\nI don't know how to feel about this anymore. I'd usually talk to my brother about these things, and it's surreal that he's the one I'm fighting. I can't tell my fianc\u00e9e, and many of our friends overlap.\n\nThe only other person who knows about this is our mom, who's divided: she thinks what my brother did was wrong and I'm right to be pissed at him, but I didn't have to stoop as low as I did by threatening his relationship.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1695396060, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16pd365/aita_for_forcing_my_brother_to_buy_me_a_new/", "score": 6879, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would want to know my SO have this side before getting married to them, to make an informed decision.\n\nYour mother is also low-key AH here, you did not stoop anywhere, if he wasn't a liar, thief, and cheapskate to boot, nothing would've been threatened, it was all his own doing. On the contrary , he almost ruined your proposal because his GF of course posted the ring in the group chat. \n\nAlso I must wonder, he probably came up with the whole proposal just to be the first one in some weird rivalry with you, he couldn't plan it since he wanted to borrow your ring and could not count on that option before you told him. So he decided to go ahead with the proposal within days, only after you told him your plans. That's honestly nuts. And he has some major complex towards you apparently.", "NTA\n\nI mean, even if only temporary, *he stole your engagement ring*. He was entitled and deceptive.", "NTA\n\n\"Hey will you marry me?

Probably felony theft given the likely value. And he can't very well say he \"would\" have given it back if he didn't give it back the moment you asked him to buy you a replacement.

This is a huge character flaw.", "NTA. When you \"borrow\" something after you have been expressly told you can't it's called theft.", "NTA - he stole your ring. Lets just stop right there.", "NTA. This is WILD. Your brother really took advantage of you, not just by using the ring, but stealing it from your home after you clearly said no. You aren\u2019t wrong for wanting him to replace the ring, and since he was not being considerate, I think it only makes sense that you find a way to have him get you a new ring.", "NTA. He went through all this nonsense and in the end he had the money to buy another ring in the same price range anyway?\n\nWhat the hell is he smoking? I definitely would not keep quiet about this regardless, this will come out eventually and when it does, it will be chaos.", "NTA, if he wanted a placeholder ring so bad he could have just bought a cheap ring. Most jewelry stores allow returns within a certain amount of days. Him not wanting to buy his own ring is ridiculous. That\u2019s part of the whole deal. You\u2019re investing in a piece of jewelry for your partner to partially show your commitment. If she said no, that sucks, but he would most likely be able to return it or sell it. In my opinion you should tell her anyways, it changes the context of the proposal. He wants to marry this woman but couldn\u2019t be bothered to get an actual ring for her? Being gifted a ring from a family member would be a million times better than stealing it.", "NTA. How does your Brother stealing your ring to give to another woman make you the AH ?

To be the one who proposed first? His actions were turdly. He still feels you're in the wrong.", "NTA at all.  Your brother is a total AH.  Let him be mad, HE is the one who did a number of things wrong.  Honestly, I feel sorry for his fianc\u00e9e who doesn't know, I believe, that he is capable of such behaviors.  That's scary for her and I suspect his dishonesty will be an issue in their marriage.  Hope you like the second ring more.", "NTA. He got off cheaply for an extra $100. It could have cost him his relationship and his self respect and he's being defensive and a AH because he knows it.", "NTA. .He STOLE the ring from you, gave it to her, let her post photos of it. He NEVER planned to give it back to you.  The threat was low but he STOLE YOUR RING....which is exponentially lower.  He owes you an apology.  If he does and is sincere, you can tell him you will forget this.  I would go LC with him as it appears he is not the person you thought he was.  I am sorry.", "Absolutely NTA\n\n' placeholder ' rings are a thing, I've known about people proposing with cheap rings because they wanted their partners to know they were committed towards marriage but couldn't afford a ring, or wanted their input on style, etc. \n\nWhat a placeholder shouldn't be, is a ring your brother bought to propose to his girlfriend that you stole. \n\nIf I was his fianc\u00e9e, I'd want to know.", ">  brother bought the ring, but is still accusing me of being inconsiderate and childish\n\nMethinks the gentleman doth protest too much.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your brother is a complete asshole. He went behind your back and stole the ring. And as if that wasn't enough, he heard about your plans and got engaged to his girlfriend beforehand to steal your thunder.

It doesn't even matter if he would have given it back or not because you clearly can't use that ring as an engagement ring for your gf now. Your brother is absurd. And an asshole.", "NTA.

His fiance doesn't want a borrowed ring, your girlfriend probably doesn't want a ring used in another engagement and posted publicly (I wouldn't either, I'd get over it after hearing this insane story, but it would be weird), and your brother STOLE the ring in order to do this. \n\nYou solved the problem by simply stating you would tell everyone the truth of what happened. That's not a threat, because if your brother thought what he was doing was okay, he wouldn't be worried that people would know what he did. So good for you for getting this solves quickly, and your brother can just be in his own world for as long as he wants.

You're nicer than me. I would have called the police and reported the ring stolen. What your brother did was terrible. \n\nGood for you for getting a ring that was more valuable though.

He crossed your boundaries, lied, stole, showed zero respect to you or your girlfriend or his fianc\u00e9e!!! I\u2019m so sorry this happened. This is manipulative that he\u2019s the one not talking to you. What you did was a reaction to his behavior and he should own up to it.

In a situation like this I would be fucking furious because how could he do this to me?? But once I realized where the anger was coming from: a place of pride, place of disappointment\u2026 etc. I would look back at that person and be gentle about his shortcomings and realize this could\u2019ve been addressed differently without losing the relationship. But I don\u2019t blame myself AT ALL. Like I said realistically we all immediately react especially if the hurt comes from a loved one. I\u2019d apologize for threatening his relationship but make sure he understands what he\u2019s done by labeling it\u2026 \u201cMy boundaries were crossed, I\u2019m betrayed, against my will\u2026.\u201d Without going over what happened because that\u2019s only going to keep you in a loop.

Your brother did something extreme and frankly violating, even if they think your response was extreme (it was not, btw), that extreme was justified.\n\nSeriously, play this scenario out for both of them. If his plan had succeeded, and he returned the ring to you, and you propose with it, your girlfriend would be asking why you are using your brother\u2019s ring. Your brother\u2019s fianc\u00e9e would also be wondering why your girlfriend got what I assure you she is thinking of as HER ring, even if it was a. \u201cplaceholder\u201d. So either you tell your girlfriend the truth, and then the story is outed anyway. Or he\u2019s forcing you to lie to the woman you are going to marry, and lie to his fianc\u00e9e as well, in which case his fianc\u00e9e is going to have VERY weird bad feelings about both you and your girlfriend for using/accepting the ring.

You say this is out of character, so before going all scorched earth ask what's going on. But there is no reason yet (or maybe ever) to tell either woman. It doesn't solve the problem, it just makes it worse.

You let him off easy instead of finding the ring at the higher price else elsewhere and forcing him to make an exact replacement AND explain to the 2 gfs why the rings are identical.

If his gf leaves him because she learns that \"her\" ring wasn't chosen or purchased by him with her in mind, but rather stolen from you - and chosen by you for your gf - so be it. His actions would be the cause, not you. Is this a golden child situation that you have somehow overlooked your whole life?

How could this criminal and hugely disrespectful, hurtful and damaging behavior totally come from nowhere AND be condoned by your mother? NTA but brother is a huge one and - sorry! - your mom is also TA for her reaction. Consider telling your gf the entire truth.

And The brother proposed to his GF with a ring he stole from his brother. I mean WTAF?!,  \n\nI also have a feeling that perhaps the brothers girlfriend was maybe pressuring him to get engaged. And when he found out his brother was going to propose that he felt that shit  was going to hit the fan if I don\u2019t do it first sort of thing but who knows.", "Yeah but the original ring was on sale meaning it could have been worth much more I hate that OP even looked at the price tags\ud83d\ude22", "She **definitely** needs to know that the man she is marrying is willing to commit a crime to get his own way! Brother asked, OP answered \"No\" so brother stole it anyway. Stealing an engagement ring is a felony level crime, depending upon the dollar amount stolen. (In the state that I live in, anything worth over $500 is a felony.)\n\n That is serious information I would want to know about a future spouse.", "No shit!  He definitely needs to be outed to his brother's fianc\u00e9e.", "Agreed! It was trying to be completely over the top, but by the time I was done typing, it was like, \u201cOh, that sounds really fun, actually!\u201d Lol", "One she better not turn her back on especially if she has any nice jewelry", "All true but I hope he can work things out with his mom, his dad is gone & he has lost his brother (things will never be the same:( so, so sad", "This is at least the fourth comment I've seen where they are wanting to shift the blame onto the brother's girlfriend, implying she must have been pressuring him or something, despite the fact that it was clearly stated the brother didn't know if she'd say yes or not. If she'd been pressuring him, a yes would be obvious.\n\nSeems like the only thing she's done wrong here is getting engaged to an idiot and being excited about it, but that's hardly her fault. But people sure love the try and blame a woman for a man's bad behavior.", "Yeah, that one made my head spin...then spin.back!", "I think you're right, I don't think there was ever a \"placeholder\" given with the ring", "Oh, I'm not wonder I have no doubt he will never replace the placeholder IF it really was presented as a placeholder, which I doubt. The sad part is the relationship of OP & his gf also has a cloud over it to no fault of their own, in a way", "Yeah, I think the same thing"]}
