{"id": 512, "submission_id": "yhup7m", "title": "AITA for pranking my brother", "selftext": "The title is really oversimplified, just a heads up. \n\nI (M18) have spent the past three ish years living with my dad's ex (lets call her Jane) (she's not my mom, her and my dad were together way before I was born) because I was pretty sick ahd her family's incredibly rich and has like a million doctors so they could give me better access to better treatment. The original plan was that I would just go with her family and my dad would join me afterwards once he got work stuff sorted, but the pandemic  got in the way and made it harder for my dad to join me afterwards since I am immunocompromised and he wasn't in a position to be isolated with me. I'd rather not go too much into the specifics of it all but what you need to know is that I hadn't seen my dad in person for over a year before this week.\n\nDuring the period of time that I was gone, my dad took in a different kid (M16) since he's registered as a foster parent. Since then, he's adopted the kid. And I had a lot of differing emotions over it when I first found out, and also a lot of time to sit with them. I've spoken to him over the phone a couple of times, but never in person.  \n\nAnyways, I got the news that I would finally be able to go home a little while ago, and decided that I would surprise my dad (and new brother) with it. It's not entirely a surprise in the sense that my dad was aware I've been getting better and would be getting home sometime late October/early November, it's just a surprise in the sense that he wouldn't know the exact moment I'd get home. So, Jane agreed to help me arrange it and all, and I ended up deciding I'd prank my brother when I got there. Nothing too bad, just make him think the house is a little haunted before revealing myself. He'd mentioned that the house *felt* like it should have a ghost or two, so I found it fitting. \n\nI did just that yesterday, and it was pretty fun. I got to finally meet my brother and actually prank him in the process, which I thought was normal brother stuff? IDK, never had a brother before. But IDK, I suppose he was more spooked than intended cause my dad's reaction upon seeing me was just to scold me for \"trying to run off\" the kid. Not my intention at all, but yeah, was told it just made it seem like I wanted him gone. \n\nAnd, listen, okay, maybe a prank wasn't the best first impression, but I really don't think it's a big enough deal that I don't even get a welcome here, you know? I said so to my dad and he was all \"consequences of your actions\" talk.

Pretty weird to prank someone you have literally just met and are supposed to be trying to form a relationship with.
