Your sister is offering a lot of help which you would benefit from immensely. I would apologise and accept her generous offer.", "YTA - It doesn't sound like she's \"flaunting\" her money. Rather that she enjoys a comfortable life but is also willing to share what she has. She's offering to pay for your college education (with a few caveats) and will only require you to pay her back if you end up making enough money to do so, and at a much better deal than you'll get from any loan companies. You're not necessarily TA for denying her offer, but you definitely are TA if you you deny it because you think she's \"flaunting\" her money by offering you some help.\n\nYour sister sounds like a good person who is lucky enough to live a fulfilling life, and you seem to resent that.", "YTA\n\nShe\u2019s giving you an unbelievable gift.

If I don\u2019t get a job that makes that much by the time I\u2019m 50, she will forgive the debt completely.'\n\nThis is not a bad deal at all. What's the alternative; student debt with interest? I think this was an opportunity to negotiate (i.e. part time work? Depends on course hours. 10 year repayment? You could ask for flexibility here to ensure you can also save for your first property).", "I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s really flaunting it in the way you are perceiving it. I think her offer to you was reasonable. It is about being responsible and allowing you to be responsible. She\u2019s offering to you interest free a debt with an incredible term to it that will never impact your credit. A chance to enrich your education and become financially responsible which will only benefit your future. Why would you think negatively of her for that? You admit to being jealous yes? Are you misplacing your frustration of feelings/ possible missing support from your parents on to her instead? YTA accept the fact that your sister wants the very best for you without spoiling you.", "YTA she's too generous for her offer but I don't think you deserve it because you are entitled and mean", "YTA, this is not a handout. She is offering to loan you money with no interest. I repeat: no interest! There\u2019s a reason why student debt is such a huge problem in the US (assuming that\u2019s where you are.) She is taking on all the risk here. You are not. \n\nFYI, your sister is allowed to do whatever with her money. Instead of just spending it all on herself, she also donates to charity and is offering to help you out with college. So many people don\u2019t have that luxury. Also good for her for traveling and having a nice apartment. Imagine if she didn\u2019t do anything with it and just hoarded it all? I bet you would be calling her greedy. \n\nYou\u2019re letting your jealousy cloud your decision. I sense a little competition for your parents attention too, which goes beyond your sister offering to pay for your college. If you want to be financially independent and carve your own path, have at it. It\u2019s hard to see life at 30 when you\u2019re 17, but financial responsibility can be incredibly stressful and detrimental to your mental and physical health. Take the help where you can, you\u2019re not less of a person if you do.\n\nEdit: financial responsibility can be detrimental if you\u2019re suffering under the weight of debt/not able to afford proper care/etc.", "YTA, and a spoiled brat as well. You don't want a handout but also annoyed that she's asking to be paid back, only if you earn over 70k before your 50?", "YTA. Your pride and jealousy is getting the best of you. But hey, if you want to drown under student debt, all the more power to you! Enjoy never paying it off, I guess.", "YTA.  You admit you are jealous of your sister's success.  It sounds like she has worked hard to get where she is and can easily give to the community.\n\nShe is trying to give you a hand up, not a hand out.  She would be a very good role model for you if you can get that chip off your shoulder.  Grow up.", "She don't have to\n\nShe's doing you a favor, and she can make the rules\n\nYou don't have to accept\n\nYou also don't have to be ungrateful\n\nYta", "YTA, you\u2019re ridden with jealousy 100%. Your sister is being incredibly kind and grateful while also treading that line of trying to make it feel like she\u2019s not pitying you (telling you a very gracious plan for you to pay her back over a decade, and not even forcing that plan). It\u2019s her money and not yours. She is capable of paying for your college and not needing the money, yes, but it is still her money and she has the right to want to be paid back.", "YTA and not because you aren't accepting a \"handout\". You realize that many people are unable to pay back their student loans, especially because of the interest? Having you pay it back is to show responsibility from your part regardless of how much money she has. Also, how do you think that the rich stay rich? They make financially smart decisions.  I can see why you would be jealous of your sister, but you have to stop and question is this jealousy rational? You are comparing yourself to a grown woman, someone 15 years older than you. You will have your own success at your own time. It sounds like she has worked really hard for where she is at and she seems to be doing a lot of good with the money by giving back. You don't have to accept her offer, but your attitude is really off-putting.", "Hahahahahahahahahahaha. Jokes gonna be on you. YTA. \n\nIf you don\u2019t understand the absolute GIFT of interest-free student loans, I don\u2019t know what to tell you. Can I have your sister?", "Was your sister really conveying all this in a very sarcastic and purposefully dismissive or merely stating under what conditions she'd support you?\n\nConditions by themselves don't even seem very imposing as well. If you didn't need her money all you had to do was convey the same in one sentence that you're good enough to get scholarships by yourself or that I'll fund myself somehow.\n\nYou're really saying that you actually want the money for free because she has more. That's even more messed up on your part.\n\nYTA", "I think your feeling a bit insecure about her success and that's normal however I can't stress enough how privileged you are in being offered this help. Even if you don't want to accept you should still be thankful to your sister for being willing to support your education. YTA unless you can get over your insecurity/jealousy.", "YTA but you're young.  A month or two working a dead end demeaning job in customer service will fix how you look at this offer and because you're family it will probably still be in the table. \n\n\nDon't be jealous,  your sister has....16? Years on you.  You'll develop into a cool rich philanthropic awesome person too. Use her as a role model.", "You have a Looooooot of growing up to do. YTA", "YTA\n\nIt seems like you are letting some kind of sibling rivalry or jealousy stop you from taking your sister up on a generous offer.\n\nBe pragmatic. Your sister has the good fortune of having a good fortune, and she is ready to let you benefit from that. This is not something you are entitled to, and the fact that she is offering it means she is literally trying to share the wealth.\n\nTake the money. And if she offers to take you on a fun vacation, do that too.", "YTA and you clearly don't know a great opportunity whe  one is offered to you.  If you don't like the offer that's she's made, the  decline it.  You have a whole lot of hostility toward someone who's just trying to help you.", "YTA. You\u2019re letting your feelings cloud your judgment, partly because of the jealousy you described. It sounds like your sister is being generous and offering you an opportunity. Of course, it\u2019s your choice whether to accept.\n\nBut I would take a step back and re-evaluate this situation once you\u2019ve cleared your head. You might find your sister isn\u2019t so bad after all.", "When one of your pieces of evidence that someone is an asshole is \"they foster animals in need\"...you may in fact be the asshole in the room. YTA.", "YTA. You're letting your jealousy cloud your mind. Does your sister mistreats or treats you differently? Not only that, you're only 17! Of course your adult sister is already on a whole other level than you but it also seems as though she cares and wants to share her wealth with you. So yeah...this really comes off bratty unless she's been rubbing it in your face intentionally.", "YTA. you\u2019re 17 it\u2019s not fair to yourself to compare yourself to a 32 year old. take it from someone finishing college, this is an amazingly kind offer. any loans you\u2019ll get that aren\u2019t government loans will have predatory interest rates and you\u2019ll be paying those back the rest of your life. she is offering you something incredible. please, don\u2019t let jealousy or insecurity ruin this amazing opportunity. push past it this once. she is successful! be happy for her and strive to do the same if that\u2019s what you want! she\u2019s not being an asshole about it, she\u2019s doing what she wants with her money!", "Wow you don\u2019t like your sister at all. Based on your 2nd paragraph it doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019s annoying about her money. You can definitely decline her generous offer and let your jealousy make decisions for you. YTA especially for the entitlement.", "YTA you come across as bratty. Does not sound like your sister flaunts anything. Every single one of my family members shares vacation pictures, and we look forward to seeing them. That\u2019s not flaunting. It\u2019s sharing. Because people who love you are interested in you. You are 17 and have a lot of maturing to do. She does not owe you a college education. The fact she offered you an interest free loan is an amazing offer. You\u2019d be dumb to not accept it. She sounds like a generous nice person. You can learn a thing or two from her.", "YTA. lol WOOOOOOW. Number one, she doesn't really sound like she's doing anything to \"flaunt\" it. She just has it, and you have to witness someone else having more money. Number two, you sound selfish af. She made you a pretty generous offer, and you just completely insulted it and her because she wouldn't give you (someone who openly dislikes her) tens of thousands of dollars. If you're not careful, you will always be like this.", "YTA. There\u2019s a huge difference between flaunting money and simply spending it. It sounds like your sister is really using money for things that are meaningful to her. \n\nThe offer to pay for your schooling up front and to forgive the loan if you don\u2019t end up in a high paying job is an amazing opportunity. That would allow you to end up in public service or an artistic-type job that doesn\u2019t pay a lot, but that fits you, if that\u2019s where you end up. \n\nAnd you\u2019re angry that if you end up in a high-paying job and could easily repay her, she wouldn\u2019t also just outright forgive the loan? Talk about being ungrateful.", "YTA\n\nYour sister is trying to do the best for you. She is setting you to be in a better situation than so many of your peers and wants to make sure you don't have as many problems as the rest of us and likely not deal with problems she had. She isn't a \"philanthropist\", she is a philanthropist.\n\nYou seem like you're stuck in a loop of hatred and jealousy that feeds itself.\n\nHere's the thing though as well to consider. Your sister is human, you bet she makes mistakes and you bet she has troubles of her own.  You're half her age and hostile to her so it's not likely you'll find them out, so all you see is the positive in her life and that further feeds your jealousy.\n\nGo to therapy, get over it and accept the gift or you know what don't but each time you complain about debt, each time your friends do, remember this is your choice and not your sister's.", "YTA. You don't have to accept her offer if you don't like her conditions but you're not grasping how generous her offer actually is. Also, she's not flaunting her money, she's just living her life, you're seeing it as annoying cause you're jealous. It seems you're insecure about being compared to her, which is normal and ok, but maybe you should talk about your insecurity, possibly with your parents or with friends or even a therapist if you're not comfortable opening up to the people around you? You feel like you're not measuring up, but you have to realize your sister is much older than you, it's not a fair comparison to make. Maybe when you're 32 like her you'll have an even 'better' life (by your standards, anyway) than she has now.", "YTA....this has jealousy written all over it.  If I was your sister I'd withdraw the offer.  Enjoy finding loans, grants, scholarships to cover the cost.....also on average it takes 21 years to pay off student loans.....Enjoy\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89", "YTA - look you can choose to agree to her conditions or not but you don\u2019t need to be a dick about it and you can\u2019t expect her to just give you that amount of money without any conditions, especially not when your being rude to her. She isn\u2019t selfish for expecting to get paid back if you earn a high salary either. \n\nWhat you should have done was thanked her for the offer and told her you\u2019d think about it then go and decide if you want to deal with student loans or with her system.", "YTA. You\u2019re letting your jealousy cloud your thoughts. Her offer is much more generous than taking out student loans.", "YTA and your parents are right. You hate that she has money to spend and you hate it when she offers to invest in your education? She can't win with you because you're so petty.", "YTA  your parents are right, you are acting like a spoiled brat!, you are not entitled to a single cent from your sisters hard earned money! She wanted to do you a solid( that noone has made for her) .   lets see you at 50 still trying to pay off your bank debts because you expected your sister to work so you can benefit!, start working see how it is to earn a cent and than complain for such a precious gift ( loans with no interest is truelly a gift).", "Yta and a spoiled brat. She offered you a great deal. Now you need to work your ass off to go to college and it\u2019s your own fault.", "How did your sister become  successful? Maybe take notes instead of being jealous. It's one thing to be envious and another to be jealous.", "YTA - Don\u2019t let your jealousy get in the way of what appears to be a wonderful gift. Lots of people would kill for that opportunity.", "YTA", "YTA - You straight up admit you are jealous of you sister who is nearly twice your age and you're not even done with high school yet. Go look at how screwed over you'll be taking the equivalent in student loans because they wont care if you're making $70k a year or $0 a year.", "Wow are you seriously going to pass up a 0% interest student loan over jealousy? YTA she\u2019s tryna help you out", "I\u2019m not sure you\u2019re even mature enough for college tbh. How can you even compare yourself to your THIRTYTWO year old sister? She has had more time to actually do all these things. You\u2019re still a minor, give it a minute. Or do you think your sister was rich and successfull at 17 already?\n\nShe\u2019s not flaunting, she\u2019s trying to help you. Think about your future. YTA", "YTA she doesn't have to help you at all you entitled brat! If I were her I would immediately withdraw the offer and let you pay student loans for the rest of your life or not go to college. The absolute gall you have.", "YTA - someone\u2019s willing to give you a full ride to college and all you have to do is basically graduate, work part time and join a single club? Yeah\u2026 you\u2019re being obnoxious.\n\nYou could end up getting student loans instead which are going to have interests rate and not care what you make. There\u2019s also no forgiveness date if you don\u2019t pay them back. You\u2019re stuck with them.\n\nYou\u2019re letting your jealousy sabotage your own future.", "YTA\n\nYou can turn her down graciously.\n\nBut you also sound like a bit of a fool.", "YTA\n\nI would rather owe my sister the money and pay her back than than take money from some predatory loan company. All her caveats seem reasonable and you should take her up on it before she changed her mind.", "YTA.\n\nAlso, quite entitled and jealous. Work on this.", "Yes YWBTA and frankly you'd also be ridiculously stupid because that's an amazing arrangement that will allow you the best chance to have a good life. I get that you're a teenager and you have no life experience and your reaction is being colored by sibling jealousy but please take it from the adults- this is an amazing and generous offer and provided you already plan to go to college, you'd be extremely foolish not to take it. ESPECIALLY if the alternative is taking out education loans, which are wildly more predatory than your sisters very minor stipulations.", "YTA\n\nIf this is true, you cut off your nose to spite your face. And were rude about it, to boot.", "YTA but I think it comes from your age. It's your sister's money, she can do with it as she pleases and it's clear that her success bothers you (you admit it yourself you are jealous and it's good that you understand your emotions). The problem is that it's making you resent your sister.\n\nI'm sure she isn't perfect, but the conditions she has stated for lending you the money are very fair. You are still young, so you might not understand the opportunity she's giving you here. The conditions are not \"controlling\" they are there to make sure YOU leave college more prepared and give you a better chance at the job market so you can be as successful as she is.\n\nOP, you are a kid but if I can give you one piece of advice on this situation it would be this: it's okay to feel jealous, but your resentment will corode you. Take the loan from your sister and get your own higher education, you'll probably be making as much money as she is in no time. Then you can travel and buy purses and even donate more than she does at the dog shelter. She's giving you an opportunity, not a handout.", "YTA, I think reading this post from the bottom up really tells the story. You want her to pay for your college without conditions, when she told you there would be conditions, you backfilled reasons why she's a bad person and came here to confirm it.", "Amazing. Just too amazing - this brings being an AH to a new standard.", "YTA. But you mostly just come across as exactly what you are: An immature kid who thinks they know more than they actually do", "NAH. You are 17 and clearly recognize that you are jealous so I won't touch the language choices you use to describe your sister's job and free time. For the question at hand: are you an AH for not accepting money with strings attached? No. You are not. Is your sister an AH for offering money with strings attached? No, she's not. Loaning money to family can go well or extremely poorly and I don't blame either you or your sister for offering or accepting/rejecting the offer.   \n\n\nI know quite a few people on here will say you are an AH for not taking the money, but we don't know the details of your family enough to know if mixing loans and family would be a smart move for you. I'd just suggest to think about it deeply. What happens if things go wrong? What if you drop out of college? Will your relationship with your family change? How about if you fail a class or get fired at a job? Will you still be able to go to college if you take a month to find a new part-time job? 2 months? What grades are you expected to upkeep? What are your alternatives for getting money to pay for college? Can you get scholarships? Do you want to go to college or are you considering an alternative? Big decisions shouldn't be made quickly and you should do what's best for you short-term and long-term and not worry about if you come off as an AH right now.", "YTA and your parents are correct...\n\nSounded like an old person complaining about young people with the whole remote work and \"more PTO than actual work\" in the first half.", "INFO:  Have you tried for scholarships on your own?", "YTA.   Your sister is not 'flaunting' her money.  She's trying to share it with you, her little sister.  She's enjoying her life--as she should!--AND trying to help you build a happy, successful life for yourself.   \n\n\nApologize to your sister.  Tell her you're sorry you were behaving like a jealous brat but you're a jealous brat who is trying to do better.  It sounds like your sister loves you and will forgive you easily.

I didn\u2019t even get my degree because working that much with school made me spiral after 3 years. I cannot imagine having this kind of privilege and being mad about it \ud83d\ude44\n\n\nYou sound very jealous and spiteful for no reason. YTA x1000000", "YTA. You are not entitled to your sister's money at all, and it was very thoughtful for her to offer you an interest free loan to pay your college. Many people, including myself, work part time during college to help pay bills. A club will be good for your resume and your socialization. \n\nShe is your sister, and she sounds very giving and caring, as well as professional. I love it when my family or friends share pictures of their trips. That isn't flaunting to me. \n\nJealousy like you have is very toxic and will make you miserable. Turning down an amazing offer like this because of jealous is only going to hurt you. Do you have any idea how much the interest on a student loan will cost you? On a $40,000 loan you will pay about an extra $23,000 dollars over 10 years. Don't let your own jealousy bite you in the ass.", "Sorry kid YTA. So many people would KILL to have their college paid for and you are throwing it away because your sister has her shit together. Also, you're sister's conditions are so that you stay focused in school and take advantage of all of the opportunities like she did so you can be just as successful. Ffs she even put in allowances if you ended up finishing school and had a hard time finding work. Because let's face it. The economy is going in the tank and there is a GOOD chance life isn't going to work the way you hope.", "YTA.  Your sister is being generous by offering you a no-interest loan and you\u2019re ungrateful.  She is asking you to pay it back  (only if you can) to partially offset the opportunity cost of lending you that money rather than investing for her retirement.  She\u2019s losing out on this deal even if you pay back the loan over 10 years.", "Don\u2019t accept her money. Take out loans that will accrue so much in interest that you will never be able to pay it back. And then you can complain that you can never buy a house or afford to have kids or afford anything. Martyr yourself!\n\nYTA", "YTA, it's not a hand out it's a loan, and if you don't get it from her, you can get it from a bank or government. Which are more unforgiving, so YTA. You don't have to take it, but why wouldn't you?", "Maybe just to spite her you should go to your dream school and take out loans for the full amount. \n\n\nThen graduate, struggle to find work in your field, and spend the next 10-20 years in abject poverty while diverting the majority of each paycheck to the bank to keep the aforementioned loans from going into default. \n\n\nFinally, in 20 years you\u2019ll have the satisfaction of thinking those loans are paid off only to look at the balance and realize every payment you\u2019ve made was applied to interest and not the principal. \n\n\nThat\u2019ll put that money-flaunting sister in her place! \n\nYTA.", "YTA.  Even worse, you're the idiot.  Adult you -- who has worked a full-time job and knows the value of a dollar -- is absolutely kicking your past self in the butt.", "YTA you could have skipped all these words and just wrote, \"I'm super jelly of my sister and it's a symptom of my low self-esteem.\"", "YTA that\u2019s a dream offer and she is not obligated to do that", "YTA. Wanna trade sisters? Mine has multiple kids with multiple baby daddies, can't hold a steady job, and has essentially robbed our dad of his hard earned money because he's an enabler, while I have constantly been told that I need to do better and more for myself. \n\nYour sister is giving you a huge gift by offering to pay for your schooling upfront, and I bet that with her network of contacts, could secure you a high paying job upon graduation. You're also comparing yourself to someone nearly twice your age. Of course she's better off than you right now. Get a grip.", "YTA. Learn a bit from your sister. You have half her age. Team up with her instead of acting like this. You got a lot to learn.", "YTA.\n\nNot for refusing the money, as your sister can put it to good use on someone or something more deserving, but for everything else. \n\nI've never seen someone with this big of an age gap who hated their older sibling like this. Usually people tend to be much closer in age to feel this level of competitive resentment and bitterness. You're only 17! You don't need to compare yourself to her, and it would be silly to expect yourself to measure up.\n\nYou let your envy make you turn down the chance of a lifetime. No debt. No interest. An external motivator to ensure you do well and make the most of your college experience. \n\nYou clearly need some help to work through your anger at your sister for being perfect. Ask your parents for therapy-- it's not going to get any easier, especially when you're repaying your student debts in a few years and remember that if you'd been less bitter, you wouldn't have them at all.", "YTA \n\nI mean, are you that stupid? This opportunity is amazing. I have 17 years old daughter- can she take her?", "YTA. Sounds like an awesome sister", "YTA. Have fun getting chained to a government loan now.", "YTA, but you\u2019re also a teenager, which can be an absolute rotten time for self esteem.\n\nIt\u2019s ok to feel jealous, but you\u2019re comparing yourself to someone who has a 15 year head start, and it will only make you resentful. Be kinder to yourself, you\u2019re just getting started, and it sounds like your sister wants you to succeed too.", "Hoollyy shit I've never seen a bigger YTA on this subreddit. Jesus christ. Sounds like you are too stupid to go to college anyways if that's your reaction to getting a debt free education... I volunteer to be her new sister!", "Holy shit... Can she adopt me as her older sister that she has to take care of?\n\nYTA", "YTA. \n\nYour sister offered to pay for your college and you called her a bitch. I predict you will come to regret that.", "Hey, tell me what ur sister does bc i wanna be like her toooo :((( also YTA", "oh my GOD YTA. this is an incredible offer. i\u2019m also starting college in the fall and i would LOVE to have my entire education paid for, are you kidding????? also, clubs and a job would be good *for you,* being able to make friends and have some extra spending money for yourself. you sound jealous of your sister and are just refusing her offer out of pettiness and spite. get over your pride and take the offer to have your ENTIRE EDUCATION paid for instead of being hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt", "YTA.\n\nYou *are* acting like a spoiled brat. I get that you're jealous, and that's natural. But it's possible to use jealousy as a constructive emotion. Make it push you to do better if not equally well. Be proud of your sister while also being jealous of her. Jealousy is usually because we want what someone else has. So make jealousy work this way--not I don't have that so you shouldn't have it either, instead, I want that for me, and I want that for you. \n\nYour sister is trying to do you a solid. And you spat in her face for no reason other than you're feeling petty.", "YTA and I hope she rescinds her offer forever", "YTA.  You\u2019re  \u201cbiting the hand that is going to feed you\u201d.  Get out of your insecure head and realize when someone\u2019s giving you a hand up in the world. Be grateful and kind.", "It's funny, she's the wealthy one, and yet you're the spoiled brat.\n\nShe's trying to give you a leg up, and trust me, those conditions she set are *not* onerous. What do you think student loans will cost you? Do you think those come with baked-in loan forgiveness if you don't make enough money? Do you think those care all that much if you make $50,000 vs $100,000?\n\nLook, will you accomplish as much as soon as your sister? Maybe not. But I'll bet she didn't set out to actively sabotage herself at 17 the way you're trying to do.\n\nAnd at least her parents have one kid moderately intelligent, generous kid. \n\nGet your head out of your ass, recognize a gift when it's offered to you, and stop being a little shit. YTA", "YTA. Youre being dumb af rejecting her offer. What is your other plan? Get fucked over with student debt? Because as an adult in that situation, it's not fun. You are in an incredibly privileged position and messing up your own future over some really misguided and immature jealousy. The fact that you're comparing yourself to her is so strange. You are a child - your sister is a well-established single adult without her own family to support in a completely different life stage. You still have time to do the same things. If you go to school and graduate without debt then you one day might be able to have the same lifestyle and luxuries. Or you could think like a child and give yourself future that could have you living paycheck to paycheck. It's like a first grader being jealous that their sibling can work and drive a car. Grow up and stop getting in your own way. And FYI if you are jealous of the animal shelter work, go sign up to volunteer! Pursue your own interests! And when you've cooled off have an honest, peaceful talk with your parents about how you're feeling like they're not as proud of you and it makes you sad. But dont blame your sister for your parents not giving you the validation or attention you need.", "YTA, and harming your own foot here.\n\nSo many of these stories end with \"Oh you don't have to pay me back. Here I saved what you did pay back so far, get a car or house, get a step up in your career!\" But now you'll never know because you were jealous and entitled. \n\nShe didn't have to offer to pay for you in any way. Have fun getting scholarships and student loans now!", "YTA for being a brat you are being offered an opportunity a lot of people dream of and you are mad your sister is placing guidelines so you are successful. If you don\u2019t end up with scholarships or grants what do you think happens with a loan? That you just don\u2019t pay it back?", "YTA and jealously is an ugly look on you.", "YTA. You are being a jealous, short-sighted brat and your sister is being incredibly smart and generous. She isn't your parent, she does not need to do anything for you. She offered this out of the goodness of her heart, but she also wants to make sure you don't just squander this gift and goof off on her dime. She wants you to develop a work ethic and budget, the HORROR!\n\nBut hey, have fun with those student loans and high interest rates.", "YTA, but you are also 17. I remeber being 17, it is a hard time with a lot of pressure. It must be really hard feeling like you're being compared to your sister. Take a step back and reconsider, this is a very good deal she is offering you.", "You have carte blanche to pursue any career you like. You are only obligated to pay back the loan if you have a job that allows you the disposable income to pay it back and that's with no interest. You're not being asked to maintain a certain GPA which is required of most students who get a free ride to school. You just have to join a club  (something you'll probably do anyway) and maybe work a few hours a week at the school library. Instead I assume you want your parents to go into massive debt to cover your college, where you'll do everything your sister suggested, you'll just eat up everybody's inheritance. YTA", "YTA.\n\nHoney, accept it. Trust me... future you will be happy ya did.", "YTA Most people would be thankful to be debt free after college.", "YTA for all the reasons everyone already listed. Your sister is 32 and newsflash\u2026 32 year olds with money travel often and spend their money and set themselves us for a good financial future. That\u2019s literally the point of being successful is to have disposable income to live life. \n\nThe only thing I will agree with you on is her asking you to join a club and do part time work study. This feels a bit controlling. Does it matter what college you go to? What major your in? Could you do trade school instead? Would a sorority be considered a club?  I get that everyone is praising the sister and so do I but sometimes these situations are a slippery slope. Like when parents say they will pay for a wedding but then want to choose or control multiple details, leaving the couple to feel like they should have not even accepted it.", "Nailed it. If OP had an objection to the stipulations, she could have actually talked them out. \"Wow, sis, that's really generous. But first-year college students often suffer from burnout, and I'm worried about these extra things you want me to do. Is there any grace in this agreement for if I need to just focus on my studies?\"\n\nInstead, she was offended by the thought that her sister would put *any* (imo, reasonable) stipulations on how *her own money* was being spent, and dare to suggest that OP pay it back at a reasonable and penalty-free rate, but only if and when she's financially able to.\n\nYTA, OP, and a jealous brat.\n\nETA: I agree with the comments below me that the sister's stipulations aren't unreasonable and are for OP's own good. The point I was trying to make was simply that if OP had concerns, she could have opened a dialogue instead of lashing out.", "That is an excellent summary.", "Because all it comes down to is jealousy. She\u2019s wrong no matter what she does because OP is jealous.", "This exactly. OP, she is basically handing you an opportunity to do as well financially as she does, which you admit you are jealous of, and you\u2019re throwing it away because *checks notes* you\u2019re jealous of how well she does financially? C\u2019mon now.\n\nI would ask if the club has to be an academic/professional club or if it could be social club (like a sorority), but either way, accept her generosity!\n\nETA verdict: YTA", "Right? Those are like the easiest conditions ever, especially since OP could probably just find part-time work right there on campus, and they probably would have gotten a part time job even if their sister wasn\u2019t funding their education. A lot of clubs are also fairly low commitment; many of the ones at my college only met once a week or even once every two weeks.", "YTA, it\u2019s like \u201cCan I be adopted into this family?\u201d", "Just wait until OP sees the interest rates!", "It\u2019s not just \u201cimmature teen\u201d sadly. When the oldest child is genetically lucky, they can\u2019t win. They will always beat a path that their siblings will be judged against, even if there is no favouritism by the parents. \n\nI feel sorry for my younger sister - I wish that my sister had been cleverer than me (teachers always compared her to me) or had bigger breasts than me (one of her boyfriends commented on the size of mine up against hers), or had been more successful in her career (I ended up as a senior in local government admin) or in marriage than me (my husband and I were teenagers when we started dating and have been together for 47 years) or had had a daughter like me (she only ever managed to have one child - a son) or had been able to support our elderly mother like me (I lived 300 metres away from Mum - she lived 2 hours away). Not one of those things I could change (except how close we lived). They were NOT my fault, it was how my life worked out.", "Yes, OP, the combination of you being a teenager and being jealous is really clouding your judgement here. I can guarantee that if you let this opportunity go to waste due to your pride and envy, you will seriously regret it as an adult who is either drowning in student loans or struggling to find a comfy, high paying job without an education. Your sense of entitlement is strong - she doesn\u2019t owe you the money - she doesn\u2019t owe you anything at all. Her asking that you pay her back someday when you\u2019re older and in a similar position to her is mature, generous, and fair. Not \u201cstupid and selfish\u201d as you\u2019ve described it. Au contraire friend - someone could say you denying this gift because it isn\u2019t enough for you is actually what\u2019s \u201cstupid and selfish\u201d. \n\nYTA. Grow up, swallow your pride, thank her for the opportunity and have a great time in college and a great life with your college degree and no excessive student loan interest debts.", "Also those caveats are to help provide focus and goals. If it were without condition, that breeds apathy- the attitude of not caring about how well you do in classes or even going to some of them, because its not like you're losing out on anything- you didn't have to pay/work for access to em!", "Yep. Most people would kill for interest free student loans, never mind not having to pay them back if you don't get a higher paying job", "Who wants to bet that she resentfully accepts this (very kind) offer, then only ever lets her employers pay her \u00a369,999, just to keep her sister's hands off the loan? OP seems so clueless about money that I'm sure she would financially cripple herself just to one-up her sister.", "Right? The conditions are essentially the same things you should do anyway to get the most out of your major. Join a club and do work study part time. Both things that look good on a resume and help build the connections that become vital later on.\n\nOP YTA. You aren't just looking a gift horse in the mouth, you've gone and taken a flashlight to the back end.", "This is kind of what I was thinking too. I struggle to accept help, especially if it\u2019s financial, and was even worse when I was younger. I can also see the age gap adding a bit of \u201cif I don\u2019t succeed on my own as well as she does then I failed\u201d which may also impact wanting to accept the money. \n\nOP, YTA, in this case, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because you really mean what you\u2019re saying. As someone with 3 siblings and age gaps, there definitely is/was pressure and comparisons. My younger brother definitely felt it and it caused him to hate his school/major because neither were a good fit. Once he transferred schools and switched majors, he was so much happier and now doing very well. I\u2019d have a sit down with your sister, explain that you\u2019re frustration and jealousy is making you act out in anger. Set some parameters with her, make sure it\u2019s a school you want and a major you want and the best ways for you to succeed.", "Yes, this. You have so much growing up to do OP.", "It's probably not her doing the comparing.", "Absolutely this. How much do you want to bet OPs parents reached out to sister and either directly or indirectly implied that they would love for her to offer this option to OP since they can\u2019t help OP pay for college themselves?", "I was wondering this myself. OP sounds like a grumpy old person.", "Yeah the college offer is an amazing opportunity. It takes the burden off of OP (and possibly their parents) and the work-study stuff is pretty common among scholarships. This jealousy and resentment is really going to bite back in the future. The sister is really trying to give OP a leg up that can have lifelong advantages if she\u2019s willing to put in good work.", "Having a part-time job, being in a club, and studying full-time is the reality for, in my experience, the majority of college students in the US. They\u2019re also recommendations, if you can manage them, from a professional development perspective. The idea that those qualifications are unreasonable is completely at odds with the average student experience, again in my experience working with college students. \n\nAnd honestly, even if they were the appropriate approach is to say \u201cthanks for this generous offer, but I\u2019m not sure that I can meet those qualifications. I\u2019m worried about burnout working while studying. Could we agree that I work full time during the summers?\u201d and arrange something else.

This is strictly an option to allow OP to go to school, not a \u201cI have $100,000 lying around, what do you think I should do with it?\u201d question? Why would OPs sister offer to donate money to a charity when they goal is to help OP get through college?", "I can see why OP would be hesitant to take the offer. The conditions do come across to me as controlling. Also, depending on the major, having to work PT and join a club might be hard to do. Some majors don\u2019t allow for much or any extra activities. \n\nThat said, OP could have declined politely if that\u2019s what she wanted to do.", "Reddit has a very weird fixation on the idea that the only type of \"gifts\" that exist in the universe are \"unconditional gifts\" where you get something for nothing with zero strings attached, and I am here to tell you that is not the way the world functions for the most part. \n\nEspecially in families, MOST gifts are conditional to some degree or another. Parents can even take away the things they've given to their kids as punishments for subsequent behavior. Gifted a car for your birthday? Maybe you're grounded and can't use it if your fail your Math class or violate curfew. Totally allowable.  \n\nIt is true - the offer being made by the sister is a conditional gift. It comes with strings. I tend to think that, objectively considered, it's a really fucking fantastic offer being made and OP would be a fool not to consider it. But it's certainly up to OP to take the deal or not take the deal. Doesn't make it not a gift. It just may be a gift with strings she's not willing to accept - and that's on her.", "It's not a gift at all. It's a loan. Loans come with strings attached.", "Why it is suppose to be a gift?!\n\nDidn\u2019t OP sister worked her ass for that money?", ">Its not a gift when it comes with strings attached.  Its a control thing.\n\nHow did you read this and think it was a gift in any shape or form? It is so obviously a loan. \n\nAnd a control thing? Well yeah, that's how a lender ensures the loan is repaid, but they're pretty fucking generous terms. No need to start paying back until OP is making $70k/year, and no interest to pay either. \n\nYou need a life lesson just like OP does.", "Yeah, I guess I\u2019m just too prideful because I\u2019m looking askance at all these people shredding OP for not immediately prostrating herself in front of her sister for college tuition. I wouldn\u2019t take the deal either. There\u2019s something to be said for forging your own path in life. Taking this gift would make make OPs life just another one of big sister\u2019s accomplishments.", "I don\u2019t think the caveat is about a superiority complex at all. I think the caveat is based on the knowledge sister has gained as someone who built themselves professionally. Making less than $70,000 and paying back loans in a meaningful amount of time is hard if you live in an expensive city. I think sisters thought process is \u201cif you\u2019re not making enough money to pay me back and still be financially healthy, you don\u2019t need to pay me back. But if you are, then I expect to be paid back.\u201d \n\nYour reading into this is equally as unkind to sisters motives as OP is being.", "Sister sounds like a legit saint. Would not have  been surprised if the money op \"paid back\" would've ended up into an account / trust/ investment vehicle for op to use for their next big life event - buy a home, marriage, retirement, starting a family, kids' college fund etc any or which ever applied.\n\nHonestly though the requirements are absolutely nothing . A part time work study campus job for a freshman/first year (assuming they're in the us based on terminology but if I'm wrong please lmk!)  is almost always capped for the exact reason you mention. It actually was something that was frustrating for me because of my school commitments and other unmovable commitments the only off campus jobs not too far to walk or bike weren't really options. But I was capped at 8 hours max per week or maybe even 6? \n\nHad to get very creative with tutoring and sewing related side gigs. So the sister is basically saying for under Ten hours a week of work - work that's actually op doing things that they should be doing in college as resume and skill building (and also honestly- fun with the club part) , op would've had an amazing setup .", "So I thought it was too much too and then looked at it again and what another commentator said about it being for her own good is so true. Like the advice on every \"how do I college post?\" is join the club/professional society for your major & look into on campus jobs related to your major (work-study will pay for being a peer TA and sometimes for working in a research lab, tutoring gigs help you as much as who you're tutoring, etc).", "I know seriously.

If OPs sister would like to adopt an older sister sign me up.", "umm wtf? This has to be satire", "I thought that too!  \n\nBut I hope by then OP has matured, and understands by then how incredibly generous her sister is being.

Actually I think you put into words perfectly what I meant, 'I'm not sure I can meet those qualifications' and compromise, which working the summers actually would be the perfect example. I feel strongly about helping young people and setting them up for the future but without becoming entitled and ungrateful, teaching them responsibility.\n\nFrom the post it's very hard to know what the sister is like. I initially read it as OPs jealousy seeing her as flaunting her new money THAT SHE WORKED FOR but then the conditions makes me wonder is she a now being a bit big for her boots and forgetting her roots.

That comes out to somewhere between $12,000 - $30,500 in interest over 10 years assuming you keep current on your payments which would be between $430ish - $1100 a month.  NBD!  Who wouldn't love paying an extra $30,000 just for the privilege of borrowing money from a bank instead of your sister.

I know it feels like she's flaunting her money at you and You're probably frustrated that you're the only one who sees it that way, but her offer was not only very reasonable but also in your best interest. She's asking you to do part time work study and be in a club and pay her back all as a way of helping you grow to become a smart strong responsible adult.\n\nMaybe sit down with her and have a heart to heart, I really don't think she's doing any of this to show off and make others feel bad.

She's offering you a massive leg up and you're shitting on the offer, grow up.", "I would like to offer a very gentle YTA with the caveat that I think I understand where your feelings are coming from and I can appreciate both your perspective and your sisters. \n\nIt seems like you have been getting quite a few comments accusing you of youthful ignorance and entitlement; I would like to offer the alternative view that being a teenager emerging on adulthood at this point in time carries with it a ri-goddamned-diculously stressful set of circumstances and concerns that today's adults (I'm 43 F for reference) did not have to contend with. But forget shit like school shootings, climate change, unstable economies, and a damned global pandemic...I still remember what kept me up nights when I was younger and one of the worst was the expectation coming from all sides that I should be making decisions at ages 16-18 that would cement the course of my entire freaking life. I feel like that expectation still exists for young people an it's a complete mindfuck. And in your case you seem to have an accomplished older sibling and I imagine that perhaps you may sometimes feel some pressure to measure up to an intangible standard. Her are two truths about that though:\n\n1. The standard is a lie. Success is a different equation for everyone, happiness is even more complicated, but it is going to look different for you than it does for her and you need to know it's okay to take the time you need to figure it out. \n\n2. Her life my look perfect to you but it's not. Trust me, you are only seeing the highlight reel. \n\nThat second point is not meant to cast doubt on the authenticity of your sister's journey. Based on your account she seems like a person who is proud of what she has accomplished and that she is eager to share her best moments with the people she cares about. The offer that she made you, though...that's what makes me feel like she has a realistic idea of what a bastard this world can be and that typically comes from experience. She is attempting to provide you with a softer path because she can afford to.  Her requirement that you pay her back if you can eventually afford to is a kindness a well; typically straight-up handouts don't people into the best versions of themselves.  But she is not asking for interest so it's not like she is trying to turn a profit, and if you don't make enough money at the appointed time, you're off the hook. It's a package that includes accountability without penalty. It's also pretty damn overwhelming. Have you even decided for sure that you want to go directly to a four year university? Or tech school? Maybe you want to take a gap year and get some work experience. She presented you with a very large proposition which I feel she did with the best of intent, but still...it's a lot to think about. And maybe you didn't have the best initial reaction...let those among us who reacted perfectly to every potentially life altering situation when we were 16 years old cast the first stone. \n\nMaybe a good jumping off point here would be for you to get to know a little bit more about your sisters experiences, the things that made her successful and the obstacles she faced. You don't have to follow in her footsteps but you may find some insights in what she has to say, both for your future an your relationship with her. Good luck. :)", "YTA\n\nNot because you don't want to take the money. If you don't like the conditions, then fine, you don't have to take the money.
