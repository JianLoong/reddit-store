{"id": 23173, "submission_id": "15a657l", "title": "AITA for refusing to split half of the check for dinner with my best friend like we usually do?", "selftext": "\nMy best friend, Vanessa 24f and I 25f have been friends since the 2nd grade. We've been supportive of each other's successes and accomplishments, and we're always there when one of us needed the other.\nWe've also ALWAYS split the check when we go out for dinner or brunch or anything like that. We've agreed to do that for a long time, plus it saves time and doesn't complicate things for us and the servers and it didn't matter how much one of us ordered. She was the one who suggested it and I was like \"Okay, sure\".\nI'm not really a big eater so whenever we would go out, I would only order about 15-35% of the entire price for both.\nVanessa, on the other hand, always has a huge appetite and would order 65-85%. The percentages depend on the occasion, appetites, and the price of the food. \nRecently, Vanessa got a huge promotion at her job for which she has been working her ass off and she wanted to celebrate, so she suggested that we go out to this fine dining restaurant nearby and I agreed because she deserved it. \nBut before I continue, I should add that a few weeks prior, my older sister Bianca told me how ridiculous it was that i was splitting the check by paying half of it when I would only order food that amounted to only a quarter of the check. \nSo before Vanessa and I ordered our food, I told her that I want to only pay for the food that I will order. She said \"Okay\". When she saw that I was actually paying for my own food, she was like \"Wait, you were being serious before?\". Um... Yes, I was being serious, and she said \"Oh, I wouldn't have ordered so much if I knew you were being serious\". (The total bill was around $560 and I only ordered around $145 worth of food). I asked her why wouldn't she think I was being serious and she said that it's because we've been splitting the check in half for so long that she literally thought that I was joking. I told her that I'm just sick and tired of paying half when I only order a small percentage. Like, I'm paying at least $50-$100 more than I should every time. So she became a bit mad and said \"And you just decided to be a bitch and pull this stunt on the day when I got promoted?? Fine then, I will pay for my food\" and she did and just exited right after without even waiting for me, which was not cool because she had picked me up at my place and drove us here so I had to call an Uber and pay $36 for the ride home. \nThis morning, my phone is full of messages from my other friends saying that I was an asshole for demanding this on the day of her big promotion and for being a cheapskate. I just don't want to overpay so much. It's fine if it's $10-$20 more than what I ordered, but over $50?? That amount can go towards necessities and bills. \n\nSo......

The greedy gal may not be as good a friend as you assumed.", "Yeah NTA.\n\nVanessa is only your best friend because she is a user. A real friend would not allow you to take on so much of the bill when you are not responsible for it. I don't drink, and when I go out with friends they are scrupulous about not taking advantage on the bill about stuff like that, although they do benefit from the designated driver :-) \n\nOn the bright side, even with the $36 Uber ride home, you are still ~$80 up on where you would be if you had split the bill. I'd question whether your other friends are genuine as well. Vanessa has been taking advantage of you for a long time I'd guess - is she the only one taking advantage?", "NTA.\n\nI know she\u2019s your friend but Vanessa can go kick rocks. \n\n\u201cOh, I wouldn\u2019t have ordered so much if I knew you were being serious\u201d.

And she is a major, major asshole ordering more and more expensive food when she expects you will split the cost. She is no friend of yours.", "NTA. \n\nYour friend essentially admitted to using you. Had she known she'd be responsible for paying for her expensive meals, she would've ordered less....the fuck kind of friend logic is that?\n\nThere's only 2 ways to pay for meals, in my opinion. You pay for only your meal OR you offer to pay for the whole thing. None of that 50/50 shit. You either go all in or just focus on you.", "Asshole? No, NTA. Idiot, yes. YTI.\n\nWere you that fearful of losing her \"friendship\" by expecting fairness that you opted to just give her meal discounts since time immemorial? What the hell is even that?

I think that would make a big difference to a lot of your friends.", "Half of 560 is 280.  If your portion was only 145 you would pay 135$ for her food.  NTA", "NTA. But you need new friends. Actual friends.", "NTA she's not your friend neither are the people who text you after. She ordered more because she thought you were going to pay for it.

Being a server in the past it wasnt that much harder to split meals and drinks between 2 people than just splitting it right down the middle.", "NTA. She's clearly been using you. Why else would she say she wouldn't have ordered so much if she knew you were being serious about only paying for what you ordered?", "NTA but let this be a lesson for you. Don't let people walk all over you and don't let the problem fester like this until it blows up in your face.", "NTA- and I would tell everyone of them this... I've been subsidizing her 50-100 worth for years. Let's just round it off and call it about $10,000 to this point. Y'all go ahead and pay me the 10k- then you can tell me how selfish and shitty I am. but until you're out half a car, you don't get to tell me shit.", "NTA... she admitted that she orders more because you'd pay more than your share? That's not something a good friend would do.", "NTA.  She even admitted to taking advantage of you and you're concerned about being TA?  You're fine.\n\nSorry your friend is a jerk.\nAnd everyone else is only getting the jerk's side of the story, which I bet includes her saying you just pulled it out of the blue and tried to sabotage her happiness etc etc.   \n\nNormal friends only split the bill when it's fair. If one of them gets a huge promotion that tips the balance of money, and wants to celebrate, they'll usually pick up the tab or at least a round of drinks.\n\nI would be wildly uncomfortable with the idea of my friend being burdened by a $250 bill that they didn't benefit from.", "First, she is a parasite.  Any real friend would have agreed this imbalance is not ok and would have split the bill.\n\nSecond, how much do you guys make to think it\u2019s ok to blow 560 on a dinner?", "If she wanted to take you out to celebrate a big promotion, she should have paid fully. That she said, \"I wouldn't have ordered so much if I knew you were serious,\" meant she was planning on taking advantage of you. NTA.", "NTA. You gave her a heads up. She heard you but thought you will not follow through. And she\u2019s the cheapskate. She admitted that she would not have ordered as much or as expensive if she\u2019d pay more. And she\u2019s the one with the promotion ( and I assume pay rise) . I think your mutual friends heard a different version of events . Send them this link.", "NTA. Your friend was taking advantage of you. She invited you to go out to celebrate her promotion, and she clearly chose one of the most expensive restaurants in town. Since she got the promotion, she should\u2019ve been paying for the meal for both of you. For any of your friends that take her side I would ask them if they would be willing to pay twice with their actual bill was. You didn\u2019t spring your decision on her last minute, you told her upfront, and she still chose to overindulge. That\u2019s on her. She is clearly the AH here.", "NTA. Splitting only works if you order similarly priced things, go out often enough that it all works out when one person has a little more, or if the person who ordered something more expensive leaves the whole tip or otherwise evens it up. Ordering hundreds of dollars more and expecting someone to pick up half is ridiculous. Separate checks from now on, if there even is a next time.", "\"Oh, I wouldn't have ordered so much if I knew you were being serious\"\n\nTranslates to\n\n\"If I knew you weren't going to be paying for me, I wouldn't have ordered the most expensive items\"\n\nThat's pretty bad. You are not obligated to financially support your friend. I think splitting a cheque 50-50 when you are not eating equal amounts is weird and I would suggest you stop doing that in the future. She's mad because you're taking away the gravy train she's so used to. Her response was entitled, but I wouldn't lose a friend over it. Just pay your own way moving forward. If she can't handle that, she is not your friend but your dependant.", "NTA. I always state clearly to the wait staff when I order \u201cseparate checks please\u201d.

She\u2019s an AH. \n\nShe KNEW what she was doing by getting you to subsidize her food.   Each and every meal over the past few years she ate premium meals on your dime.    \n\nEven after you told her your limits  this time she decided you couldn\u2019t be serious and tried to manipulate you into paying for HER FOOD \n\nWhen that didn\u2019t work she abandoned you at the restaurant and then played the victim to your friend group and weaponized them against you. \n\nProfessional AH moves - all of them. \n\nIf she wants to rebuild the friendship she needs to make some serious apologies and amends", "NTA at all. She was taking advantage of you and is no friend of yours.

She is an enormous AH", "NTA. The day of her big promotion, I would expect her to treat you the dinner, not asking you to pay for things you didn't order. But even if she didn't want to treat you, she should definitely not expect an equal split. I also really don't get the friends reaction. Does she do this with them too? Also, i genually want to ask, are 400-500 dollars spent for a one's person meal, a normal amount of money where you are from?", "You told her you will only pay for your food but she still went ahead and ordered expensive food for herself and got mad at you for not helping her pay for the food SHE ORDERED AND ATE. \n\nI don't get this thing me and my friends always pay for the food we ordered like I thought that's 50-50. Since someone can literally order the most expensive sht and you might order a 50 dollar item and splitting the bill with them is so unfair it's like your friends has been using you all this time. \n\nNTA.

She is not a true friend!", "NTA\n\nSome people simply order too much and I don't want to have to subsidize their appetites.", "NTA. You told her beforehand you wanted to pay separate. It\u2019s crazy to me that she is pissed off because you didn\u2019t want to spend $135 on HER food, and she openly admitted that she purposefully ordered more because she assumed you\u2019d cover it. She\u2019s been taking advantage of you for a long time and is just pissed off you finally decided enough was enough.

She was the one who suggested it and I was like \"Okay, sure\".\nI'm not really a big eater so whenever we would go out, I would only order about 15-35% of the entire price for both.\nVanessa, on the other hand, always has a huge appetite and would order 65-85%. The percentages depend on the occasion, appetites, and the price of the food. \nRecently, Vanessa got a huge promotion at her job for which she has been working her ass off and she wanted to celebrate, so she suggested that we go out to this fine dining restaurant nearby and I agreed because she deserved it. \nBut before I continue, I should add that a few weeks prior, my older sister Bianca told me how ridiculous it was that i was splitting the check by paying half of it when I would only order food that amounted to only a quarter of the check. \nSo before Vanessa and I ordered our food, I told her that I want to only pay for the food that I will order. She said \"Okay\". When she saw that I was actually paying for my own food, she was like \"Wait, you were being serious before?\". Um... Yes, I was being serious, and she said \"Oh, I wouldn't have ordered so much if I knew you were being serious\". (The total bill was around $560 and I only ordered around $145 worth of food). I asked her why wouldn't she think I was being serious and she said that it's because we've been splitting the check in half for so long that she literally thought that I was joking. I told her that I'm just sick and tired of paying half when I only order a small percentage. Like, I'm paying at least $50-$100 more than I should every time. So she became a bit mad and said \"And you just decided to be a bitch and pull this stunt on the day when I got promoted?? Fine then, I will pay for my food\" and she did and just exited right after without even waiting for me, which was not cool because she had picked me up at my place and drove us here so I had to call an Uber and pay $36 for the ride home. \nThis morning, my phone is full of messages from my other friends saying that I was an asshole for demanding this on the day of her big promotion and for being a cheapskate. I just don't want to overpay so much. It's fine if it's $10-$20 more than what I ordered, but over $50?? That amount can go towards necessities and bills. \n\nSo......

Well she ordered the $9 (back in 2008) holy crap sugar bomb drink. Because it was on my dime. Another time we were celebrating birthdays for the month and she said she was ordering a side salad (the rest of us were ordering similar because we were headed to my house right after for more food and drinks) so I said I\u2019d cover her.

We all looked at her and asked why she would have ordered all of that then. We all paid for ourselves so the fact that she made that assumption was galling. The last time we all went out with her it was around her birthday (it was not a celebratory lunch for her - just close). I happened to have a buy one, get one $2.99 coupon so I brought it with me. She ordered small because she knew better from last time, but I told the server quietly that I would cover her.

Emotionally, financially, whatever. \n\nAfter years of feeling taken advantage of by my best friend I finally realized he\u2019s a narc. And I thought it was normal behavior because my parents are also narcs. Somehow my friend weasled his way into 50% ownership of my college graduation present which was a boat. Then he was rude and drunk on the private docks were the boat was kept and got us kicked out of the marina. Had to sell the boat thanks to him. He\u2019d do stuff like take up my Narc dads vacation time. Narc dad would go spend a week with this asshole helping him do projects on his house. Narc dad never once offered to help me with my house. Or narc friend would ask to borrow something and then expect me to drive an hour and a half to drop it off for him. I started to realize that if a twenty dollar bill fell out of my pocket and my best friend saw it, they\u2019d be the type of person who would take the $20. Long story short I cut the narc best friend and narc parents out of my life and things are so much more NORMAL now.", "Your \"best friend\" has been taking advantage of you for years and years and is not pissed that the gravy train is ending.

Move on and invest your time in friends who aren\u2019t interested in only what they can get from you.", "If you want to continue this very unequal 'friendship', just apologize to her for finally setting a boundary, and then tell her you will continue to subsidize her so she can eat what ever expensive items on the menu she desires. However, if you do that in an effort to save this friendship, you would be very foolish. She doesn't value you as a friend, she uses you as a cash machine. \n\nINFO: does Vanessa have this 50/50% split agreement with any of the friends that have been criticizing you? I would venture to say, no!\n\nNTA unless you continue to allow her to financially abuse you.", "Sorry to break it to you but it appears that while you saw a friend, she saw a meal ticket. I'd definitely review the last 15 years of history and reevaluate the quality of this \"friendship.\" It's quite likely that you'll notice the act of being a friend has gone heavily in her favor...", "What was she eating that cost over 400 just for her portion. Some of the best Michelin starred restaurants don't even charge that much per head.", "NTA you told her before you ordered food there was no need for an in depth conversation about that. That is why I hate splitting checks evenly, it usually isn\u2019t even unless you order the exact same thing. This is not on you OP, your sister was correct it wasn\u2019t fair and your \u201cfriend\u201d didn\u2019 t like being called out on that. Just the comment \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have ordered so much\u201d should alleviate any guilt you may be feeling. She was the AH for stranding you at the restaurant. As another commenter said lick your wounds and move on, she wasn\u2019t your friend she was a user.", "and what % of women take men out on first dates? fucking slim to none. so effectively women dont pay their fair share on dates.", "Toxic feminity\u2b06\ufe0f\u2b06\ufe0f", "You guys are still young so it's probably pretty easy to miss and overlook character flaws from your childhood friends. Your friend acted immature with both her expectations and slander campaigns against you. Maybe those friends who are calling you an AH should take Vanessa to dinner one by one and pay.", "Or buy 5 meals and take them to go once and see how she if she comments.", "Sure, but even OP says they didn\u2019t notice this was an issue until their sister pointed it out. I think giving the friend the benefit of the doubt and not trying to \u201chorrify\u201d them at what\u2019s supposed to be a celebratory dinner of their accomplishments would be kind of a bare minimum of how I would want to treat my own friends.", "Before they ordered but after they had already arrived. \n\nI agree it should have been dealt with before reaching this point, I just think I'd be annoyed if a routine/tradition had been set for so long and then changed with no notice (not saying that the tradition is right either)", "To be fair, I never had a friend group DO* this. At most it was underhanded gossiping, but unless something *truly* fucked happened everybody pretended to mind their business. I still believe it happens but not all toxic people/friend groups were created equal whatever whatever.", "Fuck Applebees \u2014 what d\u2019ya think I got, Bezos money? We\u2019re doing Mickey D\u2019s every time until the meals are split evenly.", "She communicated very well **before** they went to the restaurant.  She said she wanted *separate checks*, and the a-hole friend agreed.  But then the friend tried to gaslight her after she'd ordered the entire menu.  NTA & nothing wrong with her communication skills.  Something is very wrong with that \"friend\" though.", "Yeah that was my thought. It\u2019s two people. It\u2019s not a table of 12 asking for 12 checks. Once it was clear that she was paying a ton more than Vanessa OP should have said she wanted separate checks.", "Really expensive wine would be my guess. Restaurant markup on wine is crazy\u2014a good bottle of wine at a nice restaurant can easily cost several hundred dollars.", "Fine dining isn't my thing either but if it is I don't think $145 is crazy for an occasion. Plenty of people would spend the equivalent on gigs, festivals, sports, travel etc.\n\nWhat is batshit crazy is expecting someone else to pay extra for YOUR food to celebrate that YOU now earn more money.", "I'm a guy. I'm telling you, you're embarrassing yourself. this is cringe as fuck.", "You think the reaction of this \u201cfriend\u201d was ok?", "[removed]", "It\u2019s hilarious how angry people are and how much I\u2019m getting attacked for having the temerity to suggest that men and women pay their fair share on dates. But not one person has anything even remotely resembling an articulate argument.", "As I stated in my initial comment, if the comment was sincerely made as rendered by OP, then they really need to dump this friend who has been maliciously using them for years. \n\nHowever, (1) it is a bit human nature for these stories to be\u2026embellished..in a way that the OP feels casts them in the best light, so I remain a bit skeptical of the exact narrative; and (2) if OP had no mal-intent, I still think their timing for addressing this was ill advised. The question is about OP, and the friend\u2019s poor reaction does not retroactively justify OP\u2019s timing, as OP would have had no way to know what the reaction was going to be when they made the decision to bring it up.", "idk why you're so nasty, but it was pretty relevant, OP was complaining about something that men deal with so often we dont even think about it. and im not replying to OP, im continuing this comment thread", "No one\u2019s arguing with you because you\u2019re attempting to change the topic of OP\u2019s conversation to suit your argument which has NOTHING to do with what we\u2019re talking about here. \n\nIf you wanna discuss whether men and women should pay their fare share on dates, make your own post about it. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find many people to discuss that with.", "because they know its a misandrist social norm, they KNOW women dont pay their fair share on dates and when they do, theres never a second date. feminists can pull the misogyny card whenever wherever they want and when you call this out you're an evil\nbigot, its how it goes", "Who cares, she bought maybe $500 worth of food cuz she expected it to be split. She could\u2019ve told her on their drive there and not at the restaurant but regardless of the fact, she has been buying more food because she knew she wasn\u2019t ever going to pay her full check.", "The context of a date is very different from going to dinner with a friend. There are no societal \u201crules\u201d about who\u2019s paying when going out to eat with friends, so no it\u2019s not relevant.\n\nPS: I wasn\u2019t being \u201cnasty\u201d. I just gave you the same amount of sass you gave me. Don\u2019t dish out what you can\u2019t take lol", "I feel embarrassed for all the people who can\u2019t make arguments and just have to try to belittle the person.", "I made a reasonable argument and your response is overused insults. Do better.", "\"doesnt want to pay for another persons meal\"\n\"men have to foot the bill for womens meals all the time\" seems theres some relevence there.\n\n\nand to be clear i gave you sass because you are a sexist, \"but men always wanna make it about themselves\"", "you haven't made an argument. you've spouted a bullshit opinion as if it's fact and continue to spout it despite multiple people telling you it's irrelevant to the post at hand.", "No you didn't. This post has nothing to do with me but you have to make it about yourself. It doesn't matter if it's overused when it's the truth. Take your own advice before giving it out \ud83e\udd23"]}
