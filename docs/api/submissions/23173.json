We've been supportive of each other's successes and accomplishments, and we're always there when one of us needed the other.\nWe've also ALWAYS split the check when we go out for dinner or brunch or anything like that. We've agreed to do that for a long time, plus it saves time and doesn't complicate things for us and the servers and it didn't matter how much one of us ordered. She was the one who suggested it and I was like \"Okay, sure\".\nI'm not really a big eater so whenever we would go out, I would only order about 15-35% of the entire price for both.\nVanessa, on the other hand, always has a huge appetite and would order 65-85%. The percentages depend on the occasion, appetites, and the price of the food. \nRecently, Vanessa got a huge promotion at her job for which she has been working her ass off and she wanted to celebrate, so she suggested that we go out to this fine dining restaurant nearby and I agreed because she deserved it. \nBut before I continue, I should add that a few weeks prior, my older sister Bianca told me how ridiculous it was that i was splitting the check by paying half of it when I would only order food that amounted to only a quarter of the check. \nSo before Vanessa and I ordered our food, I told her that I want to only pay for the food that I will order. She said \"Okay\". When she saw that I was actually paying for my own food, she was like \"Wait, you were being serious before?\". Um... Yes, I was being serious, and she said \"Oh, I wouldn't have ordered so much if I knew you were being serious\". (The total bill was around $560 and I only ordered around $145 worth of food). I asked her why wouldn't she think I was being serious and she said that it's because we've been splitting the check in half for so long that she literally thought that I was joking. I told her that I'm just sick and tired of paying half when I only order a small percentage. Like, I'm paying at least $50-$100 more than I should every time. So she became a bit mad and said \"And you just decided to be a bitch and pull this stunt on the day when I got promoted?? Fine then, I will pay for my food\" and she did and just exited right after without even waiting for me, which was not cool because she had picked me up at my place and drove us here so I had to call an Uber and pay $36 for the ride home. \nThis morning, my phone is full of messages from my other friends saying that I was an asshole for demanding this on the day of her big promotion and for being a cheapskate. I just don't want to overpay so much. It's fine if it's $10-$20 more than what I ordered, but over $50?? That amount can go towards necessities and bills. \n\nSo...... AITA?\n\nEdit: I earn about 90k/year, minus or plus because I have several jobs, which includes dog training for which I charge $80-$100/hour. Vanessa earned a little bit more with one stable job and since her promotion she now earns 6 figures.", "created_utc": 1690378706, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15a657l/aita_for_refusing_to_split_half_of_the_check_for/", "score": 7138, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The greedy gal may not be as good a friend as you assumed.", "Yeah NTA.\n\nVanessa is only your best friend because she is a user. A real friend would not allow you to take on so much of the bill when you are not responsible for it. I don't drink, and when I go out with friends they are scrupulous about not taking advantage on the bill about stuff like that, although they do benefit from the designated driver :-) \n\nOn the bright side, even with the $36 Uber ride home, you are still ~$80 up on where you would be if you had split the bill. I'd question whether your other friends are genuine as well. Vanessa has been taking advantage of you for a long time I'd guess - is she the only one taking advantage?", "NTA.\n\nI know she\u2019s your friend but Vanessa can go kick rocks. \n\n\u201cOh, I wouldn\u2019t have ordered so much if I knew you were being serious\u201d.

She knew full well what she was doing and did it without guilt or second thought. You flat out told her that you weren't going to subsidise her anymore and she just assumed you would keep doing it because she's so used to taking advantage of you that she didn't even consider that you'd stop it.\n\nYou mentioned she earns more and you don't understand why she would do this.

And she is a major, major asshole ordering more and more expensive food when she expects you will split the cost. She is no friend of yours.", "NTA. \n\nYour friend essentially admitted to using you. Had she known she'd be responsible for paying for her expensive meals, she would've ordered less....the fuck kind of friend logic is that?\n\nThere's only 2 ways to pay for meals, in my opinion. You pay for only your meal OR you offer to pay for the whole thing. None of that 50/50 shit. You either go all in or just focus on you.", "Asshole? No, NTA. Idiot, yes. YTI.\n\nWere you that fearful of losing her \"friendship\" by expecting fairness that you opted to just give her meal discounts since time immemorial? What the hell is even that?

I think that would make a big difference to a lot of your friends.", "Half of 560 is 280.  If your portion was only 145 you would pay 135$ for her food.  NTA", "NTA. But you need new friends. Actual friends.", "NTA she's not your friend neither are the people who text you after. She ordered more because she thought you were going to pay for it. Always ask for a separate check BEFORE you order", "NTA - you told her beforehand. Then she agrees (to what she thought was a joke ?) and when she sees it's true she says this: \"Oh, I wouldn't have ordered so much if I knew you were being serious\" ?!\n\nShe basically admitted taking advantage of you and called you out for stopping it politely (telling her beforehand, not telling she's taking advantage of you just saying you'd like to pay only for your food).", "NTA- I don't get why people split evenly like that between 2 people. Being a server in the past it wasnt that much harder to split meals and drinks between 2 people than just splitting it right down the middle.", "NTA. She's clearly been using you. Why else would she say she wouldn't have ordered so much if she knew you were being serious about only paying for what you ordered?", "NTA but let this be a lesson for you. Don't let people walk all over you and don't let the problem fester like this until it blows up in your face.", "NTA- and I would tell everyone of them this... I've been subsidizing her 50-100 worth for years. Let's just round it off and call it about $10,000 to this point. Y'all go ahead and pay me the 10k- then you can tell me how selfish and shitty I am. but until you're out half a car, you don't get to tell me shit.", "NTA... she admitted that she orders more because you'd pay more than your share? That's not something a good friend would do.", "NTA.  She even admitted to taking advantage of you and you're concerned about being TA?  You're fine.\n\nSorry your friend is a jerk.\nAnd everyone else is only getting the jerk's side of the story, which I bet includes her saying you just pulled it out of the blue and tried to sabotage her happiness etc etc.   \n\nNormal friends only split the bill when it's fair. If one of them gets a huge promotion that tips the balance of money, and wants to celebrate, they'll usually pick up the tab or at least a round of drinks.\n\nI would be wildly uncomfortable with the idea of my friend being burdened by a $250 bill that they didn't benefit from.", "First, she is a parasite.  Any real friend would have agreed this imbalance is not ok and would have split the bill.\n\nSecond, how much do you guys make to think it\u2019s ok to blow 560 on a dinner?", "If she wanted to take you out to celebrate a big promotion, she should have paid fully. That she said, \"I wouldn't have ordered so much if I knew you were serious,\" meant she was planning on taking advantage of you. NTA.", "NTA. You gave her a heads up. She heard you but thought you will not follow through. And she\u2019s the cheapskate. She admitted that she would not have ordered as much or as expensive if she\u2019d pay more. And she\u2019s the one with the promotion ( and I assume pay rise) . I think your mutual friends heard a different version of events . Send them this link.", "NTA. Your friend was taking advantage of you. She invited you to go out to celebrate her promotion, and she clearly chose one of the most expensive restaurants in town. Since she got the promotion, she should\u2019ve been paying for the meal for both of you. For any of your friends that take her side I would ask them if they would be willing to pay twice with their actual bill was. You didn\u2019t spring your decision on her last minute, you told her upfront, and she still chose to overindulge. That\u2019s on her. She is clearly the AH here.", "NTA. Splitting only works if you order similarly priced things, go out often enough that it all works out when one person has a little more, or if the person who ordered something more expensive leaves the whole tip or otherwise evens it up. Ordering hundreds of dollars more and expecting someone to pick up half is ridiculous. Separate checks from now on, if there even is a next time.", "\"Oh, I wouldn't have ordered so much if I knew you were being serious\"\n\nTranslates to\n\n\"If I knew you weren't going to be paying for me, I wouldn't have ordered the most expensive items\"\n\nThat's pretty bad. You are not obligated to financially support your friend. I think splitting a cheque 50-50 when you are not eating equal amounts is weird and I would suggest you stop doing that in the future. She's mad because you're taking away the gravy train she's so used to. Her response was entitled, but I wouldn't lose a friend over it. Just pay your own way moving forward. If she can't handle that, she is not your friend but your dependant.", "NTA. I always state clearly to the wait staff when I order \u201cseparate checks please\u201d. I don\u2019t discuss it, debate it, ask some else\u2019s opinion on it. It\u2019s just easier that way.", "NTA - she\u2019s seriously seriously taking advantage!", "NTA but you allowed it to continue so you can't be surprised that she was taken aback.", "I refuse to believe these stories where you have an argument with a friend and then OTHER PEOPLE call and message you about it as though it matters.

She\u2019s an AH. \n\nShe KNEW what she was doing by getting you to subsidize her food.   Each and every meal over the past few years she ate premium meals on your dime.    \n\nEven after you told her your limits  this time she decided you couldn\u2019t be serious and tried to manipulate you into paying for HER FOOD \n\nWhen that didn\u2019t work she abandoned you at the restaurant and then played the victim to your friend group and weaponized them against you. \n\nProfessional AH moves - all of them. \n\nIf she wants to rebuild the friendship she needs to make some serious apologies and amends", "NTA at all. She was taking advantage of you and is no friend of yours. I\u2019d send these \u2018friends\u2019 a message telling them your side of the story.", "NTAH  and as a matter of fact she's been happily and intentionally making you pay for her food for years. She is an enormous AH", "NTA. The day of her big promotion, I would expect her to treat you the dinner, not asking you to pay for things you didn't order. But even if she didn't want to treat you, she should definitely not expect an equal split. I also really don't get the friends reaction. Does she do this with them too? Also, i genually want to ask, are 400-500 dollars spent for a one's person meal, a normal amount of money where you are from?", "You told her you will only pay for your food but she still went ahead and ordered expensive food for herself and got mad at you for not helping her pay for the food SHE ORDERED AND ATE. \n\nI don't get this thing me and my friends always pay for the food we ordered like I thought that's 50-50. Since someone can literally order the most expensive sht and you might order a 50 dollar item and splitting the bill with them is so unfair it's like your friends has been using you all this time. \n\nNTA.

Ask any of the other friends whether they'd pay $280 dollars after ordering $145 worth of food.  You've been a pushover up til now.", "she was 75% of the check?? just wondering - is she taking a box home? like are you paying for her to eat for a few days? or does she order the most expensive items on the menu? did she slowly start ordering more and more expensive stuff as time went on and she knew you wouldn't argue? like, it used to only be a $10-20 difference but it evolved into hundreds of dollars?\n\n\"I wouldn't have ordered so much if I knew\" is very telling. she's been knowingly doing this for years because you'd just pay the rest.\n\nNTA. it's fine if you want to treat your friends, but maybe offer to purchase an appetizer to share or order them a drink in the future.", "Where the hell are you celebrating that its over $500 for 2 people's food?!\n\nThere is no reason why she shouldn't have believed you about splitting the bill... Unless did you eat some of her food? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "Nta. Why would you pay for her meal??? That is just crazy.  Agree to have one more meal and go wild make sure she has to pay a huge amount more than what her food cost.  Take the extra food home. Then drop this selfish jerk.  She has been using you. She is not a true friend!", "NTA\n\nSome people simply order too much and I don't want to have to subsidize their appetites.", "NTA. You told her beforehand you wanted to pay separate. It\u2019s crazy to me that she is pissed off because you didn\u2019t want to spend $135 on HER food, and she openly admitted that she purposefully ordered more because she assumed you\u2019d cover it. She\u2019s been taking advantage of you for a long time and is just pissed off you finally decided enough was enough.

She was the one who suggested it and I was like \"Okay, sure\".\nI'm not really a big eater so whenever we would go out, I would only order about 15-35% of the entire price for both.\nVanessa, on the other hand, always has a huge appetite and would order 65-85%. The percentages depend on the occasion, appetites, and the price of the food. \nRecently, Vanessa got a huge promotion at her job for which she has been working her ass off and she wanted to celebrate, so she suggested that we go out to this fine dining restaurant nearby and I agreed because she deserved it. \nBut before I continue, I should add that a few weeks prior, my older sister Bianca told me how ridiculous it was that i was splitting the check by paying half of it when I would only order food that amounted to only a quarter of the check. \nSo before Vanessa and I ordered our food, I told her that I want to only pay for the food that I will order. She said \"Okay\". When she saw that I was actually paying for my own food, she was like \"Wait, you were being serious before?\". Um... Yes, I was being serious, and she said \"Oh, I wouldn't have ordered so much if I knew you were being serious\". (The total bill was around $560 and I only ordered around $145 worth of food). I asked her why wouldn't she think I was being serious and she said that it's because we've been splitting the check in half for so long that she literally thought that I was joking. I told her that I'm just sick and tired of paying half when I only order a small percentage. Like, I'm paying at least $50-$100 more than I should every time. So she became a bit mad and said \"And you just decided to be a bitch and pull this stunt on the day when I got promoted?? Fine then, I will pay for my food\" and she did and just exited right after without even waiting for me, which was not cool because she had picked me up at my place and drove us here so I had to call an Uber and pay $36 for the ride home. \nThis morning, my phone is full of messages from my other friends saying that I was an asshole for demanding this on the day of her big promotion and for being a cheapskate. I just don't want to overpay so much. It's fine if it's $10-$20 more than what I ordered, but over $50?? That amount can go towards necessities and bills. \n\nSo......

We all looked at her and asked why she would have ordered all of that then. We all paid for ourselves so the fact that she made that assumption was galling. The last time we all went out with her it was around her birthday (it was not a celebratory lunch for her - just close). I happened to have a buy one, get one $2.99 coupon so I brought it with me. She ordered small because she knew better from last time, but I told the server quietly that I would cover her.

And I thought it was normal behavior because my parents are also narcs. Somehow my friend weasled his way into 50% ownership of my college graduation present which was a boat. Then he was rude and drunk on the private docks were the boat was kept and got us kicked out of the marina. Had to sell the boat thanks to him. He\u2019d do stuff like take up my Narc dads vacation time. Narc dad would go spend a week with this asshole helping him do projects on his house. Narc dad never once offered to help me with my house. Or narc friend would ask to borrow something and then expect me to drive an hour and a half to drop it off for him. I started to realize that if a twenty dollar bill fell out of my pocket and my best friend saw it, they\u2019d be the type of person who would take the $20. Long story short I cut the narc best friend and narc parents out of my life and things are so much more NORMAL now.", "Your \"best friend\" has been taking advantage of you for years and years and is not pissed that the gravy train is ending.

I have never had a issue with it.", "Here we go with the sexist comments lmao just because someone doesn\u2019t agree with you doesn\u2019t make them sexist.

It\u2019s adjacent but not relevant. \n\nAnd it\u2019s not even that I don\u2019t agree with you, it\u2019s a conversation that we can have but it\u2019s not one we should have HERE because that\u2019s not what OP was talking about. Like I said earlier, if you want to discuss the societal pressure of men having to pay for a first date, feel free to write your own post about your experience and I\u2019d be happy to discuss it there. \n\nLastly, I hope you realize that I\u2019m obviously not talking about ALL men when I say this. Men or women aren\u2019t all the same. I\u2019m talking about men like you who fight tooth and nail to miss the point. So chill out with the \u201csexist\u201d comments.

I know this isnt directly applicable to OPs case, thats why i didnt comment on the post itself.", "I take it on a case by case basis but this just sounds too dumb for any friend to believe the aggravating party if said exactly how OP put it... But you are right and they would have likely spun a different narrative to try control it!", "Well, it's not worse optics than over-ordering every time you see someone just because you've tricked them into subsidizing you.\n\nI wouldn't even care how it \"looks\" to promotion girl.

Like sure, a friend may tell me something that another friend has done, but the most I do is to offer advice on how to deal with it/ what they might say to that friend themselves. Why would I go berating someone about something I didn't witness and am not involved in? \n\nIf I was actually \"in the room where it happened,\" and heard/saw everything, then yeah, I might tell whoever was in the wrong that in my opinion they were in the wrong.

One friend and I alternate paying, but it evens out.   Another friend doesn't have a lot of money, so we all pay our own.

I've noticed that I'm always subsidizing our friend's meal when we are going out. I would order just a little bit, she would order a lot more, and she would always want to split the bill.\n\nShe chose an expensive restaurant to go to tonight.  BEFORE WE ORDERED, I told her that we should each pay for our own plates.  She agreed.  She then ended up ordering 3x the amount than I did.  When it came time to pay, she seemed shocked that I didn't want to again  subsidize her meal.  We aren't talking about $10-20, but hundreds of dollars.\n\nShe then admitted to my face that she wouldn't have ordered so much if she knew I wasn't going to pay for half of her food!!!  \n\nShe paid for her side of the meal and ran out the door, ditching me, causing me have to spend money on an Uber home.\n\nDo you guys know if she is having money issues?

It\u2019s giving moocher!!", "INFO I noticed she picked you up and was expected to take you home? How far away do you live and is this the norm that she is always the driver. \nIt doesn\u2019t make her reaction justified and it doesn\u2019t sound like the gas and time equates to how much extra you have always paid but maybe she thought you splitting the bill offset her being the driver if that was the case. Seems like a lot of resentment built up, potentially on both. I wonder how you can be friends for so long without being able to communicate over something like this before it reached this point.\nI\u2019d be evaluating if your friendship is equal in other areas or as close as you previously thought.", "Gently YTA. You have been friends since the second grade. It's her promotion celebration.\n\nI personally would have said, hey I'm going to cover tonight's entire bill. Congrats on your promotion.

Stick with your boundaries. Just level with her. .", "You're getting $90k a year and you're fretting about a couple hundred dollar meals?

It wasn\u2019t crazy when you originally agreed to this.  Are you a bit jealous of her promotion? Why did you select this particular time to tell her that you no longer want to spit the bill?", "ESH. I get not wanting to split the bill moving forward. Me and my best friend fight (in jest) over who's paying for who when the check comes (this has continued now that we are both married). I couldn't imagine going out to celebrate something she did that was awesome and not offering to pay. I also think you could've worded why you don't want to split in a way that puts the bonus on your situation and not on her eating more. That may be where the real animosity is coming from. Also, she just got promoted so I'm assuming she hasn't been paid yet. \n\nThat being said, her thinking you were joking is either a lack of comprehension ability on her end or an attempt at manipulation to get you to split evenly.  Either way, she needs to get over herself and realize where you were coming from.", "Is your friend Vanessa fat?", "NTA, but honestly sounds like both of you can afford it. That has me wondering\u2026\n\nWho took care of the tip and was it decent? 20% or over?", "We both took care of the tip. I tipped 35% and I think she tipped 28% but I'm not a hundred percent sure.", "Seriously OP Vanessa is a rude entitled and selfish stuck up b****. She called you a b**** like it was nothing, then left without a goodbye (KNOWING FULLY WELL YOU DIDN\u2019T HAVE A CAR) AND then texted all your other friends what happened to make you look like the bad guy because she knew if you told your version first (about being left without a ride and being called a b****) they would side with you and call her an AH. \n\nShe completely understood what you meant when you said \u2018i only want to pay for my own food\u2019 but she\u2019s been walking all over you for a decade and treating you like a doormat, so she thought F that I will make her pay one way or the other because I always get what I want and I\u2019ve been walking all over her for years! So she acted dumb and surprised when you reminded her you\u2019re only paying for yourself. When you didn\u2019t budge like she had expected you to do she lost her s*** and called you a b**** and left without a goodbye. She realized she had forever lost her free meal ticket. Trust me she understood what you said the first time you said it. \n\nIt makes completely sense now why it was only the two of you celebrating her promotion, she wouldn\u2019t dare to pull this entitlement in front of your other friends. I guess you two have been eating for years without your other friends being present for this exact reason.", "Same. Even when I go out in big groups, if one person puts their card down then everyone just venmos/Zelle\u2019s the amount they ordered + tip. I\u2019ve never been in a group where people who ordered 5 craft cocktails are trying to split evenly with the person who ordered one appetizer; that\u2019s brazenly whack as fuck.", "Idk why my phone thought breadsticks were \u201cbrew rocks\u201d", "That is a really bizarre auto correct, but funny.", "MIL sounds nice enough to brew rocks for a person if there was a way."]}
