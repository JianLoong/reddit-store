{"id": 23173, "submission_id": "15a657l", "title": "AITA for refusing to split half of the check for dinner with my best friend like we usually do?", "selftext": "\nMy best friend, Vanessa 24f and I 25f have been friends since the 2nd grade. We've been supportive of each other's successes and accomplishments, and we're always there when one of us needed the other.\nWe've also ALWAYS split the check when we go out for dinner or brunch or anything like that. We've agreed to do that for a long time, plus it saves time and doesn't complicate things for us and the servers and it didn't matter how much one of us ordered. She was the one who suggested it and I was like \"Okay, sure\".\nI'm not really a big eater so whenever we would go out, I would only order about 15-35% of the entire price for both.\nVanessa, on the other hand, always has a huge appetite and would order 65-85%. The percentages depend on the occasion, appetites, and the price of the food. \nRecently, Vanessa got a huge promotion at her job for which she has been working her ass off and she wanted to celebrate, so she suggested that we go out to this fine dining restaurant nearby and I agreed because she deserved it. \nBut before I continue, I should add that a few weeks prior, my older sister Bianca told me how ridiculous it was that i was splitting the check by paying half of it when I would only order food that amounted to only a quarter of the check. \nSo before Vanessa and I ordered our food, I told her that I want to only pay for the food that I will order. She said \"Okay\". When she saw that I was actually paying for my own food, she was like \"Wait, you were being serious before?\". Um... Yes, I was being serious, and she said \"Oh, I wouldn't have ordered so much if I knew you were being serious\". (The total bill was around $560 and I only ordered around $145 worth of food). I asked her why wouldn't she think I was being serious and she said that it's because we've been splitting the check in half for so long that she literally thought that I was joking. I told her that I'm just sick and tired of paying half when I only order a small percentage. Like, I'm paying at least $50-$100 more than I should every time. So she became a bit mad and said \"And you just decided to be a bitch and pull this stunt on the day when I got promoted?? Fine then, I will pay for my food\" and she did and just exited right after without even waiting for me, which was not cool because she had picked me up at my place and drove us here so I had to call an Uber and pay $36 for the ride home. \nThis morning, my phone is full of messages from my other friends saying that I was an asshole for demanding this on the day of her big promotion and for being a cheapskate. I just don't want to overpay so much. It's fine if it's $10-$20 more than what I ordered, but over $50?? That amount can go towards necessities and bills. \n\nSo......

The greedy gal may not be as good a friend as you assumed.", "Yeah NTA.\n\nVanessa is only your best friend because she is a user. A real friend would not allow you to take on so much of the bill when you are not responsible for it. I don't drink, and when I go out with friends they are scrupulous about not taking advantage on the bill about stuff like that, although they do benefit from the designated driver :-) \n\nOn the bright side, even with the $36 Uber ride home, you are still ~$80 up on where you would be if you had split the bill. I'd question whether your other friends are genuine as well. Vanessa has been taking advantage of you for a long time I'd guess - is she the only one taking advantage?", "NTA.\n\nI know she\u2019s your friend but Vanessa can go kick rocks. \n\n\u201cOh, I wouldn\u2019t have ordered so much if I knew you were being serious\u201d.

You flat out told her that you weren't going to subsidise her anymore and she just assumed you would keep doing it because she's so used to taking advantage of you that she didn't even consider that you'd stop it.\n\nYou mentioned she earns more and you don't understand why she would do this.

And she is a major, major asshole ordering more and more expensive food when she expects you will split the cost. She is no friend of yours.", "NTA. \n\nYour friend essentially admitted to using you. Had she known she'd be responsible for paying for her expensive meals, she would've ordered less....the fuck kind of friend logic is that?\n\nThere's only 2 ways to pay for meals, in my opinion. You pay for only your meal OR you offer to pay for the whole thing. None of that 50/50 shit. You either go all in or just focus on you.", "Asshole? No, NTA. Idiot, yes. YTI.\n\nWere you that fearful of losing her \"friendship\" by expecting fairness that you opted to just give her meal discounts since time immemorial? What the hell is even that?

I think that would make a big difference to a lot of your friends.", "Half of 560 is 280.  If your portion was only 145 you would pay 135$ for her food.  NTA", "NTA. But you need new friends. Actual friends.", "NTA she's not your friend neither are the people who text you after. She ordered more because she thought you were going to pay for it.

Being a server in the past it wasnt that much harder to split meals and drinks between 2 people than just splitting it right down the middle.", "NTA. She's clearly been using you. Why else would she say she wouldn't have ordered so much if she knew you were being serious about only paying for what you ordered?", "NTA but let this be a lesson for you. Don't let people walk all over you and don't let the problem fester like this until it blows up in your face.", "NTA- and I would tell everyone of them this... I've been subsidizing her 50-100 worth for years. Let's just round it off and call it about $10,000 to this point. Y'all go ahead and pay me the 10k- then you can tell me how selfish and shitty I am. but until you're out half a car, you don't get to tell me shit.", "NTA... she admitted that she orders more because you'd pay more than your share? That's not something a good friend would do.", "NTA.  She even admitted to taking advantage of you and you're concerned about being TA?  You're fine.\n\nSorry your friend is a jerk.\nAnd everyone else is only getting the jerk's side of the story, which I bet includes her saying you just pulled it out of the blue and tried to sabotage her happiness etc etc.   \n\nNormal friends only split the bill when it's fair. If one of them gets a huge promotion that tips the balance of money, and wants to celebrate, they'll usually pick up the tab or at least a round of drinks.\n\nI would be wildly uncomfortable with the idea of my friend being burdened by a $250 bill that they didn't benefit from.", "First, she is a parasite.  Any real friend would have agreed this imbalance is not ok and would have split the bill.\n\nSecond, how much do you guys make to think it\u2019s ok to blow 560 on a dinner?", "If she wanted to take you out to celebrate a big promotion, she should have paid fully. That she said, \"I wouldn't have ordered so much if I knew you were serious,\" meant she was planning on taking advantage of you. NTA.", "NTA. You gave her a heads up. She heard you but thought you will not follow through. And she\u2019s the cheapskate. She admitted that she would not have ordered as much or as expensive if she\u2019d pay more. And she\u2019s the one with the promotion ( and I assume pay rise) . I think your mutual friends heard a different version of events . Send them this link.", "NTA. Your friend was taking advantage of you. She invited you to go out to celebrate her promotion, and she clearly chose one of the most expensive restaurants in town. Since she got the promotion, she should\u2019ve been paying for the meal for both of you. For any of your friends that take her side I would ask them if they would be willing to pay twice with their actual bill was. You didn\u2019t spring your decision on her last minute, you told her upfront, and she still chose to overindulge. That\u2019s on her. She is clearly the AH here.", "NTA. Splitting only works if you order similarly priced things, go out often enough that it all works out when one person has a little more, or if the person who ordered something more expensive leaves the whole tip or otherwise evens it up. Ordering hundreds of dollars more and expecting someone to pick up half is ridiculous. Separate checks from now on, if there even is a next time.", "\"Oh, I wouldn't have ordered so much if I knew you were being serious\"\n\nTranslates to\n\n\"If I knew you weren't going to be paying for me, I wouldn't have ordered the most expensive items\"\n\nThat's pretty bad. You are not obligated to financially support your friend. I think splitting a cheque 50-50 when you are not eating equal amounts is weird and I would suggest you stop doing that in the future. She's mad because you're taking away the gravy train she's so used to. Her response was entitled, but I wouldn't lose a friend over it. Just pay your own way moving forward. If she can't handle that, she is not your friend but your dependant.", "NTA. I always state clearly to the wait staff when I order \u201cseparate checks please\u201d.

She\u2019s an AH. \n\nShe KNEW what she was doing by getting you to subsidize her food.   Each and every meal over the past few years she ate premium meals on your dime.    \n\nEven after you told her your limits  this time she decided you couldn\u2019t be serious and tried to manipulate you into paying for HER FOOD \n\nWhen that didn\u2019t work she abandoned you at the restaurant and then played the victim to your friend group and weaponized them against you. \n\nProfessional AH moves - all of them. \n\nIf she wants to rebuild the friendship she needs to make some serious apologies and amends", "NTA at all. She was taking advantage of you and is no friend of yours.

She is an enormous AH", "NTA. The day of her big promotion, I would expect her to treat you the dinner, not asking you to pay for things you didn't order. But even if she didn't want to treat you, she should definitely not expect an equal split. I also really don't get the friends reaction. Does she do this with them too? Also, i genually want to ask, are 400-500 dollars spent for a one's person meal, a normal amount of money where you are from?", "You told her you will only pay for your food but she still went ahead and ordered expensive food for herself and got mad at you for not helping her pay for the food SHE ORDERED AND ATE. \n\nI don't get this thing me and my friends always pay for the food we ordered like I thought that's 50-50. Since someone can literally order the most expensive sht and you might order a 50 dollar item and splitting the bill with them is so unfair it's like your friends has been using you all this time. \n\nNTA.

She is not a true friend!", "NTA\n\nSome people simply order too much and I don't want to have to subsidize their appetites.", "NTA. You told her beforehand you wanted to pay separate. It\u2019s crazy to me that she is pissed off because you didn\u2019t want to spend $135 on HER food, and she openly admitted that she purposefully ordered more because she assumed you\u2019d cover it. She\u2019s been taking advantage of you for a long time and is just pissed off you finally decided enough was enough.

She was the one who suggested it and I was like \"Okay, sure\".\nI'm not really a big eater so whenever we would go out, I would only order about 15-35% of the entire price for both.\nVanessa, on the other hand, always has a huge appetite and would order 65-85%. The percentages depend on the occasion, appetites, and the price of the food. \nRecently, Vanessa got a huge promotion at her job for which she has been working her ass off and she wanted to celebrate, so she suggested that we go out to this fine dining restaurant nearby and I agreed because she deserved it. \nBut before I continue, I should add that a few weeks prior, my older sister Bianca told me how ridiculous it was that i was splitting the check by paying half of it when I would only order food that amounted to only a quarter of the check. \nSo before Vanessa and I ordered our food, I told her that I want to only pay for the food that I will order. She said \"Okay\". When she saw that I was actually paying for my own food, she was like \"Wait, you were being serious before?\". Um... Yes, I was being serious, and she said \"Oh, I wouldn't have ordered so much if I knew you were being serious\". (The total bill was around $560 and I only ordered around $145 worth of food). I asked her why wouldn't she think I was being serious and she said that it's because we've been splitting the check in half for so long that she literally thought that I was joking. I told her that I'm just sick and tired of paying half when I only order a small percentage. Like, I'm paying at least $50-$100 more than I should every time. So she became a bit mad and said \"And you just decided to be a bitch and pull this stunt on the day when I got promoted?? Fine then, I will pay for my food\" and she did and just exited right after without even waiting for me, which was not cool because she had picked me up at my place and drove us here so I had to call an Uber and pay $36 for the ride home. \nThis morning, my phone is full of messages from my other friends saying that I was an asshole for demanding this on the day of her big promotion and for being a cheapskate. I just don't want to overpay so much. It's fine if it's $10-$20 more than what I ordered, but over $50?? That amount can go towards necessities and bills. \n\nSo......
