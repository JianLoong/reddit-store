Your half siblings are not your fathers family. His family owes absolutely nothing to your half siblings. It\u2019s kind of them to send a small gift on holidays to not leave them out, but this is something large that isn\u2019t about being inclusive, it\u2019s about your grandfather passing.", "NTA\n\nYour mom's children are not your dad's children and that doesn't make them your grandparents grandchildren. Things would've been different if they were from your mom's side of the family. Your step dad and mom are the AH for expecting that.", "NTA at all! Your mom and stepdad and half siblings are all acting like entitled assholes", "NTA.  Inheritances go to blood relatives first and foremost.  Your mother marrying another man and accepting his kids as family doesn\u2019t mean anyone else has to do so.  They need to quit being greedy.", "NTA your mom\u2019s entitlement is astonishing. It was already very gracious and generous of them to have been including your (completely unrelated to them!!) siblings all these years. It must have been very painful for them to see her move on and get remarried after the loss of their son, someone they could never move on from or replace. But they didn\u2019t hold it against her and actually embraced her new children. That\u2019s rare and it shows they must have been very special people. \n\nAnd now your mom is angry because she didn\u2019t get MORE from them??? I just cannot even find words for this.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry about your grandpa.", "NTA. That is not how family inheritance works. How dare your mother confront your grandmother. If your step-dad came in with children, would she expect them to be included as well? You are the ties to your grandfather's son, not the others. They were very nice to remember them in gifts earlier to prevent kids feeling hurt, but that ends at some point like assuming they are in wills or are getting college allotments.", "NTA. She has no right to expect anything for her other children, let alone to demand it. And she knows it, that's why she wants you and your sister to make the claim for her: because you are actually part of that family. \n\nYour siblings might have known your dad's side of the family all their lives, but they knew them as that: your dad's side of the family. They were treated with kindness and appropriately included where it made sense (such as birthdays and Christmas), but they were never treated as part of the family. Because they aren't. Your mother's ties with the family changed: she got married to someone else and changed your family dynamics by having more children with her new spouse. \n\nExpecting her former in-laws to treat the children she had with another man after the passing of their son, as their own grandchildren, is quite rich. All the more when this is pure greediness on the wake of inheritance, and not about how her children were and are treated by these people. \n\nDon't get involved. Advice your sister not to get involved. And don't ever give in to pressure when eventually you two continue to receive inheritances and your mother pushes for you to share it with your other siblings.", "NTA. Your grandparents are already doing more than would be expected by buying birthday and Christmas presents.", "NTA. You're Mom is off her rocker. And entitled. As well as your other siblings. Your Dad's family don't owe them anything. If you and sister are minors have another family member put your inheritance in an account your Mom can't access.

Goodness gracious. Your grandparents sound like absolute gems. They were kind to your half-siblings, and clearly treasured you and your sister.

Which is, I guess, understandable, but to act on those expectations is pretty awful.", "NTA\n\nYour mother\u2019s new kids have nothing to do with your father\u2019s side of the family. They should look to their own grandparents (your mother and her new husband\u2019s parents) for something. It\u2019s wrong to expect anything at all.", " NTA.  It seems like the way you said it might have been a little harsh, but it\u2019s really weird that your mom thinks her kids from the second marriage are due anything from your dad\u2019s parents.  Of course it\u2019s impossible for an outsider to know all the family dynamics here, but based on what you posted, you\u2019re not the asshole.", "NTA.

No, thats your family not theirs\u2026\u2026NTA.", "NTA - it\u2019s not your call. And it sure as hell is not your moms call. She really needs to back off.", "NTA - your grandparents were very generous to include your half siblings as they were growing up.  And your mom/step-dad sound very entitled.", "Nope, you're NTA. While it was very kind of your paternal grandparents to send small gifts to your half-siblings, those children are not related to them nor to their late son and they have absolutely no obligation to leave anything to them in their will. Your mother is out of line and is acting entitled. Confronting your paternal grandmother was just wrong.", "100% NTA. It's not on the grandparents to welcome the kids they're not related to.  As you said, they didn't include them all the time but tried to be kind. \n\nI can't imagine confronting a grieving widow demanding stuff for kids who aren't related to her or her husband.  She just buried her husband after outliving her son- your mom and stepdad have no boundaries or respect.\n\nIf there's money involved, make sure she can't get to it and, if you live separately, make sure you and your sister hide the items bequeathed to you.  She may decide to take matters into her own hands.", "NTA fr. Your dad's family has no obligations toward your half-siblings.

Highly doubt it.", "NTA\n\nYour mom is being completely unreasonable.", "NTA \n\nDeaths suck. First you lose someone you care about then you find out if the people you love actually loved you back. It probably does suck for your half siblings realizing that a grandpa never really felt they were family but you also shouldn't approach death like a hand out.", "NTA - your grandfather was your and your sister\u2019s biological relative and owes nothing to your mom or her children. Don\u2019t let your mother manipulate you into \u201csharing\u201d your inheritance with her kids. If she tries to play the \u201cfamily\u201d card ask her if your step-dad\u2019s father dies, does she expect him to leave anything to you and your sister?", "NTA.

Your grandparents giving them a birthday and Christmas gift was kind, but I assume your grandparents weren't close to them, and the gifts were a polite gesture. There's no reason whatsoever for the step-siblings to receive inheritance. Your grandfather certainly wasn't wrong not to include them because they aren't close family. Your mother is being unreasonable.", "NTA. They shouldn\u2019t have expected anything since they didn\u2019t have the same closeness or memories with him that you guys had. If they *did* and they were just as involved with all of you the same, then that would be a little different. It really depends on the depth of the relationship.", "Lmao NTA how dare they even expect that", "NTA\n\nYour half siblings have their own bio father and their own paternal grandparents who may one day leave them something in their wills, just as yours have left you something. It is silly to think your paternal grandparents would leave something to your half-siblings, who aren't even related to them.", "Above my pay grade to judge family business like that seem complicated but I think I'm siding with you on that one, I think when you get with a partner that has children's it's normal to accept them as your own.\n But this is completely different since it's talking about grandparents and your half siblings are not blood related at all to the rest of your family.\nIt would be like expecting people to write children of friends in inheritance, it's OK to do but not to expect it.", "NTA. \nNow i would understand being hurt if they were your dads step children when he was alive\u2026 but they aren\u2019t so, why would they be included?", "NTA\n\nYou are not the one who decided what was being left to whom. Also, I don't see how your mother expects children with no genetic/ familial link to your father's relatives get an inheritance. Did she expect to get one herself, even though she married \"into\" another family?\n\nThat was not worded very well, bur I hope you get my meaning. Treasure the album", "NTA. It's pretty entitled to demand anything from anyone's will, but especially as your half siblings are no relation to your grandad. \n\nYour mother was out of line asking your grandmother - at this awful time for her - why her unrelated children didn't get anything. That's pretty rude. \n\nA will is someone's wish in death - and if you don't get anything, that's life.", "NTA - Your mom is off the map of logic.

Stand by for her to demand you and your sis give your half-sibs half your money. Don't give an inch.", "NTA. But eeww your mom and stepdad are icky greedy entitled AHs.  \n \nYour dad\u2019s family doesn\u2019t own them anything", "NTA. Wow your mother in entitled. Are you inheriting from step-grandparents? Doubt it.", "NTA. Your mom thinks you should \u2018stand\u2019 with your half siblings? How? What does she think you taking a stance will do? If he had a will it\u2019s legally binding.

Full stop.", "NAH\n\nIt's a fucking pin, it's clearly not about the money it's about wanting to be included and feel like they belong.\n\nThey weren't as close but clearly still part of the family and not getting anything makes them feel bad.
