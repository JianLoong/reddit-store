They may feel that it is unfair to the other kids. (It's not. It's just life.) They may choose to design their wills so that your mom's portion of the estate goes equally to all of you kids (or part to her husband and a smaller part to just you and your sister). Step-dad's portion of the estate may go only to his kids or you may get a little something from his, but his children get the bulk of (only) his share of the estate. Your mom may give a larger share of her estate to the other children if your paternal inheritance gives you a great deal of wealth, beyond your mom's estate. All of that is fair.

If a grandparent doesn't consider their step-grandchildren...in-laws (? dunno if that's what they technically are) as their full fledged family, it makes no sense to expect them to be included. I'd also be curious to know if your mom's husband's parents have included you and your sister in their will already to prove they actually believe what they claim. But that's not really necessary to stand your ground. \n\nNTA", "It depends if your half siblings was as close to him as you and your sister was. If not, then NTA at all", "NTA. People get so entitled to what they 'think' should be their's/ their kids, but in reality it's 100% the choice of whomevers Will it is. \n\nClearly, your grandparents don't see them as grandchildren. They're just kind to them. There is no reason to think they ever would by how they are treated.", "NTA.   The fact that your mom and step dad think this family would include people in their will who are unrelated to them, is beyond my comprehension.  Your mom and dad are acting extremely entitled and DO NOT let them pressure you into sharing with your half siblings.", "Hey OP this is a hard one lord knows blending or additional children, heck additional marriages can lead to all sorts of crap.  Lord know it\u2019s not the Brady bunch. But no OP NTA \u2026you and your sibling have grandparents that are not related in any way to your other siblings.  So yeah It\u2019s not really appropriate to expect something, an inheritance to boot from someone with whom you dont share any genetic relationship.  It\u2019s nice that your Grandparents provided little gifts over the years it\u2019s speaks to them being decent folks..but an inheritance\u2026that\u2019s a bit much imo.", "NTA", "Ive known my neighbour my whole life. She has bought me birthday and christmas gifts, but we still arent family. NTA", "NTA when it comes to inheritance or wills expect nothing, I have a sibling and my parents could choose split of certain things or leaving all to one or the other... Doesn't mean they don't love/accept you. If your stepfather left you nothing, you should be just as understanding.", "NTA. Your mom is nuts!", "NTA\nMy in laws have excluded everyone who married their kids, from their Wills. \n\nPersonally, I don\u2019t care. I\u2019ve only been married into the family for 15 years. But my sister in law married into the family 35 years ago and gave them two grandkids. She has been their main support system for the last 10 years. She gets nothing if her husband dies before my in laws do. Plus they have a stipulation that any money they leave to their kids is only to be for their kids, not the spouses. Idk how they think they can control that, but their Will says it.", "Wow.. How greedy can one person be? NTA", "NTA your family, your inheritance (speaking as someone with 2 halfies, and a step - why would I expect anything from their mother's side? That would be bonkers)", "Are their dad\u2019s parents going to include you and your sister in their will?  No, see half siblings are more connected than step-grandkids.  It doesn\u2019t make sense to inherit from 3 sets of grandparents.", "NTA. It was their money and their decision to make. They are not obligated to bequeath anything to anyone. I am quite comfortable, and my will is made out to give the money to those I wish to get it. Some of it is in trust so it can't be wasted in a year. My wife is happy that I have done this because it takes the pressure of family members asking her for money. Guess what? Not everyone in the family is getting something, and everyone is not getting the same amount of value.", "NTA.\n\n>She told me of course she had a right. We're all still family and the kids have known them their whole lives\n\nShe's absolutely delusional. Your paternal grandparents aren't required to include your mothers other children. She didn't have them with their son.", "NTA - death sucks,  but it sucks even more when god damn people make it about themselves.", "NTA", "Nta", "NTA. Your mother is unreasonable and so are your step siblings. Are your step dad's family planning on including you equally in their estate planning? I would be very surprised if they did.", "No wait, it's actually further than that - It would be as if the Step Dad's Prior-Marriage's Parents' would be leaving them anything, right? Like there's another degree of separation; i feel like in a lot of families the step-parent's-parents would leave things for their step-grandkids. But in this case it's the step-parent's-deceased-first-partner's-parents", "THESE ARENT STEP GRANDKIDS I don\u2019t understand why comments are giving examples of step kids. Ops grandparents have no relation to the kids, or anyone else in that house, besides op and sister.", "I think step families can be different. My stepdad's mom  was definitely my grandma. Still this is ridiculous in this story.", "Here I'm literally my step grandma's only grandchild, she's been in my life since I was eight, and I know I won't receive anything in the will. She's never accepted me.\n\nAnd it's not a sexuality nor race thing -I'm straight, and we literally have the exact same shade of pale skin and strawberry blonde hair.", "And how is that obliges her to treat not her daughter not any worse than me? And that just shows that they only ever cared about her as spermbank for their son and caretaker of their grandchildren. And yes, if you didnt notice, I count all pretentious fucks who treat their blood as some kind of the most important as assholes, you dont need to tell me theres a fuckton of shitty stepparents out there.", "Some parents get very demanding about this. I knew a woman who had kids by three different men. Only one of the paternal grandmothers was involved in any way, and she would send presents to her grandchild. Then the mother told her she wouldn't be allowed to give her grandchild anything unless she gave it to all the kids. The lady did so, so she could keep in contact with her grandchild, since the father wasn't involved. I just can't imagine telling an ex's mother that they had to buy stuff for kids I'd had with other men after the breakup.", "Good point!", "You seem to be letting your own experience cloud this situation. The kids weren't told (by OP's dad's family at least) to call them familial names. There's no double standard here", "You keep saying \u201cstep\u201d, ops grandparents aren\u2019t step anything to these kids. They simply would be nice and send them gifts for holidays. So unless mom was feeding BS into the kids ears, this expectation isn\u2019t on the grandparents. \nI will gift my nieces stepbrother gifts for Christmas, because it would be shitty for me not to, but does that mean I\u2019m putting him in my will? Absolutely not, the only way he would think so is if his mother would paint the picture of me doing so."]}
