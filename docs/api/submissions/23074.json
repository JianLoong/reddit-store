Sorry about your wife and hope her treatment is successful.", ">grandmother actually said to me \u201chow was she to supposed to know your wife was really sick\u201d\n\nReally? Your wife told her she was ill. You told her your wife was ill. Even when she started rapidly losing weight, your mother dismissed it just like the asshole doctors did before it got so bad they couldn't ignore it. I find it hard to believe that your wife didn't look sick this entire time. I suppose your mother is one of those who is never sick & thinks things like migraine pain are grossly exaggerated. NTA, and keep right on blocking the lot of them. They refused to support you and your wife the last couple of years. They do not get to cry and say they're sorry now.", "NTA.

It sounds like they jumped on the chance to call her lazy and dramatic, and unfortunately in our society that is the first thing people do. \n\nHowever, other comments have pointed out that you will need support during this time and they\u2019re right. Maybe once you\u2019ve had time to process you can attempt a conversation with them, and if they apologize give them a chance to help. If they double down on their behavior then screw then, but I bet they feel like huge AH\u2019s and deservedly so.

She is lucky to have you in her corner.  You & your wife followed your instincts & knew something wasn't right. And OP, I'm sorry to hear about your wife's diagnosis. She has a long road ahead & I'm sending good thoughts to both her & you. \n\nYour family is owed no explanation.

I cannot imagine how tough this must be on you both.\n\nHow does your wife feel about this ?\n\nI would suggest, when you feel less angry, that you speak to your mum and explain how her comments have been hurtful to your wife at a time when she was trying to get doctors to understand she really was sick as well.    Give her a chance to apologise and be there for you.  This could maybe teach your mum to be a little less judgemental and a bit more kind in future ?", "NTA but two wrongs don\u2019t make a right.

It happens too often!\n\nNTA", "OP, I'm not sure you'll read this, but in case you do:\n\n1. Sending you and your wife much love, many hugs, and healing vibes. Cancer is A LOT to deal with. In fact, your opening list of your wife's symptoms immediately made me think cancer. They're very similar to mine and my sister's symptoms that turned out to be endometrial cancer for both of us.\n\n2. Your mother did this to herself, being cold, rude, and projecting her beliefs onto your wife instead of being concerned and supportive. Your wife could've been suffering from any number of issues and deserved to be listened to and supported, your mother chose not to. Turns out your wife has a very serious illness, and your mother wants forgiveness because \"she didn't know\"!? No. How has she earned that forgiveness. She needs to find ways to support you and your wife during this time, make up for her behavior, do better.\n\n3. Go LC/NC with anyone who isn't willing or trying to help you and support you. It may be cynical of me, but I learned (after my cancer diagnosis) who truly supported me and were worthy of my time/effort/energy. Yes, it may hurt to cut others out of your life, even if they're family, but sometimes it needs to happen. You'll always have 2 separate divisions: the life before cancer and the life after cancer. I had to go LC with my mom a few years before my diagnosis because of her and her husband's treatment of me. My mom wasn't present for any of my cancer treatments (I even nearly died and got no support from her.) In fact, her husband said \"Cancer!? But we've already done that!\" It's not a competition, it's not about others, it's about your wife and you and doing what you can and need to do to live life each moment as it comes. No toxicity allowed!\n\nI hope you and your wife have the support you need going through this. If you're in the US, the American Cancer Society has a ton of resources, so I'd highly recommend looking at their website and speaking to one of their patient advocates or counselors. If not in the US, look into seeing if your country has something similar. The ACS was such a gift during my treatment, and one of the things they offered to me gave even bigger blessings that still affects my life to this day!\n\nGood luck, remember you're NTA, and don't forget to simply breathe. Cancer us a lot, but you can make it to cancer-free for your wife if you take it with hope, goodness, and doing everything just one step and one breath at a time. Hugs!", "NTA my friend.

I can only imagine how terrible and draining it must be to know something is wrong, and not only be continually dismissed by doctors, but then dismissed by your own family. \n\nI am perplexed and horrified as to how the doctor's not test/catch this sooner. 2 years is so long in terms of cancer progression.  I am not trigger happy in terms of suing, but if you're in the US, I would definitely start gathering my paperwork, make sure I have all instances where I were ignored, and go seek a plaintiffs lawyer. To not even test for it at any point in 2 years with those symptoms is malpractice", "NTA. She knew that your wife was sick, because you and your wife told her. She just chose to not believe it.", "Would you really want someone that said you were faking or thoroughly dismissive around you while dealing with cancer? Even if they apologised for being heartless? I say this as a survivor...NO. Sometimes those people just make it worse. Also notice these people aren't upset that the mom was cruel and asking her to apologise. They are putting the emotional work on OP, they don't want to help, just make sure mama's fee-fees are ok. Please don't advocate that people should allow family like this back in. Boundaries exist for protection. OP has chosen his boundary. OP is NTA", "Hell no, relations that cause stress is way worse than not having their \u201dsupport\u201d.
