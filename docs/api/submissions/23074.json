In fact, your opening list of your wife's symptoms immediately made me think cancer. They're very similar to mine and my sister's symptoms that turned out to be endometrial cancer for both of us.\n\n2. Your mother did this to herself, being cold, rude, and projecting her beliefs onto your wife instead of being concerned and supportive. Your wife could've been suffering from any number of issues and deserved to be listened to and supported, your mother chose not to. Turns out your wife has a very serious illness, and your mother wants forgiveness because \"she didn't know\"!? No. How has she earned that forgiveness. She needs to find ways to support you and your wife during this time, make up for her behavior, do better.\n\n3. Go LC/NC with anyone who isn't willing or trying to help you and support you. It may be cynical of me, but I learned (after my cancer diagnosis) who truly supported me and were worthy of my time/effort/energy. Yes, it may hurt to cut others out of your life, even if they're family, but sometimes it needs to happen. You'll always have 2 separate divisions: the life before cancer and the life after cancer. I had to go LC with my mom a few years before my diagnosis because of her and her husband's treatment of me. My mom wasn't present for any of my cancer treatments (I even nearly died and got no support from her.) In fact, her husband said \"Cancer!? But we've already done that!\" It's not a competition, it's not about others, it's about your wife and you and doing what you can and need to do to live life each moment as it comes. No toxicity allowed!\n\nI hope you and your wife have the support you need going through this. If you're in the US, the American Cancer Society has a ton of resources, so I'd highly recommend looking at their website and speaking to one of their patient advocates or counselors. If not in the US, look into seeing if your country has something similar. The ACS was such a gift during my treatment, and one of the things they offered to me gave even bigger blessings that still affects my life to this day!\n\nGood luck, remember you're NTA, and don't forget to simply breathe.

I am not trigger happy in terms of suing, but if you're in the US, I would definitely start gathering my paperwork, make sure I have all instances where I were ignored, and go seek a plaintiffs lawyer.

A *lot* of cancer is missed in younger people in the UK as well, because they just won\u2019t check for it because it\u2019s less likely, seems to be most often women but it happens to men here too. It\u2019s a disgrace. It\u2019s in the news so often.\n\nI\u2019m not a doctor but even before the weight loss I could have told you that sounded like she should be checked for cancer.\n\nNTA and good luck.", "As much as your family are AHs my concern is for your wife and for you.

NO!!!! \n\nOP don't do this. \n\nThis is a terrible advice. MILs can never be mothers. No matter how much they say 'you are like a daughter to me'. If something happens to the wife, she'll probably shed a tear and then get on with her life like nothing happened. She probably won't even do much to lessen their burden.and after how she treated OP's wife do you really think it's fair on a cancer patient to see and communicate with a person who didn't believe in her struggles before??? \n\nYou can't teach old dogs new tricks. By doing this OP will be just inviting new form stress in his life. A toxic person is toxic.

I\u2019ve been minimizing my discomfort because I didn\u2019t trust how I felt in my own body! It\u2019s absolutely debilitating to have that compounded by poor medical care (thanks sexism). I only began advocating for myself once I had a truly supportive partner + extended support system. It\u2019s an uphill battle and now that it\u2019s cancer, they only need the people who were already supportive around to help.

It is like we are always crazy before we're just in tune with problems in our bodies. \n\nOP, I'm so sorry to read about your wife. I'm relieved you and your wife finally have an answer, even if it is cancer. I was so worried for your wife reading the first part of your post because in my head, I couldn't stop thinking, \"This sounds like a digestive or reproductive cancer.\" The fact that doctors missed it and dismissed her symptoms is unacceptable, and I agree you should collect your paperwork.\n\nAnd NTA.

I had something similar happen where I was feeling kinda sick and off for years.

The doctors finally found the cancer a few months ago. I can't imagine how much worse I'd've felt if the whole time I was struggling with medical problems and guilt over letting domestic chores fall to my husband I ALSO had to listen to my in-laws insist I was just being lazy and taking advantage. \n\nYou're doing what's best for your wife. I hope treatments work well for her and she can finally be well again soon.", "NTA and good for you for standing by your wife's side in this horrible time.\n\nYour reaction was a reasonable response; your mother could've chosen to be more empathetic, or even worry about her daughter-in-law's condition, but she had to be a snot about it. Your family members who are being dismissive about it can gtfo too. I mean, the consistent sickness should've sounded alarm bells in the first place.\n\nHoping the procedure and chemo goes well for her! And I hope she gets well soon.", "NTA.

Been in that situation, although nobody acted up in the family.  Wife had serious health problems that required a transplant and some people just thought she was being lazy and/or using me and the kids as a 'crutch'.

That should be a no-brained, but the bar is low these days it seems.\n\nSome friendly, unsolicited advice. Chemo isn\u2019t as bad as it used to be with all the supportive IV meds created to help. It\u2019s the week after chemo that sucks all the balls. She\u2019s gonna feel like shit. She might even get A abolish herself. She probably won\u2019t want you or the kids or the dogs or the wind or sunlight, etc. to touch her. It\u2019ll be frustrating for both of you no matter how hard you both try. Just accept all that now, that you\u2019re both human, and prepare to let any negativity go as soon as possible. It\u2019s only temporary. On a more personal note, I hated being called a \u201crockstar\u201d or \u201cstrong\u201d or any of that shit. Those words get tossed around so much that it\u2019s hard to hear them as genuine, but again, feeling like absolute dogshit all the time colors your perception. It\u2019s only temporary, my dude, and you guys will get past it.", "NTA. Sounds like your mom resents your wife. Seems like she feels that your wife shouldn't be your main focus but really, doesn't matter if she is sick or well, she IS your main focus.

I hope everything improves.", "NTA. Your mom did know your wife was sick, she just didn't believe her. I'm currently in your place right now - my fiance' is ill with a heart condition, multiple heart attacks last year and so far the doctor's can't figure it out. My family doesn't take it seriously at all and and thinks he's faking it or should just \"man up\" and start doing physical labor again. Sounds like you you just snapped after putting up with your mom repeatedly insulting your life partner. Also, your mom sounds pretty sexist, being mad at your wife for not cooking for the holidays. What's stopping any of the men from cooking?", "NTA, you have one thing to worry about right now, supporting your wife while she fights for her life. I had major issues with my husband's family when he fought cancer. The treatment is hell, the suffering that they go through is epic. You do not have the time or energy to give to people who can't stop thinking about themselves for one minute. Surround yourself with the support that will be there, you will need it. Your mother is not going to help you, she will just stress you out and try to make it all about her. You need to go NC with any family on your mother's side, at least until your wife is done with treatment. Just know you wife's perspective and tolerance for family members behavior will change. My husband said after treatment he knows how precious life and his time are, he will not waste it on family or friends that cause drama or stress. If you ask him to let certain actions or behavior slide to keep the peace, he will refuse. He will not give time and forgiveness to people that do not deserve it.", "And by family members!

I thought I was weak and feeble, intolerant to pain, making a fuss - all the usual excuses you tell yourself. Nope - 2 shattered vertebrae and a fractured sacroiliac with the nerve trapped where it had healed.

Another time was when I was having a sever anxiety attack where I felt like I couldn\u2019t breathe, and she told me that there are kids with cancer, so I should be fine. I shocked myself with the power socket and told my mom I was fine, just my heart was just racing because it scared me. She called up my grandmother in front of me and told her that I thought I was having a heart attack (?) and how dramatic I was being. \n\nI finally told her that my sisters and I are not hypochondriacs, we were just kids concerned when something doesn\u2019t feel right and wanted reassurance that we were fine, not mocked.", "I really, really dislike people who judge women for not being well.

My mum is similar, she thinks you can \"talk yourself out of\" most things like, ya know, anxiety and depression.
