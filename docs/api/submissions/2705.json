We got married 4 months ago. For context, I have a 10 yo son \"Billy\" from my previous relationship and my ex isn't in the picture.\n\n\nI have to admit that Philip's relationship with my family isn't so great. They would disagree on a lot of things. For example, he had an argument with my dad when he said that he was keeping their grandson away from them but Philip stated he wasn't and that he couldn't visit with Billy because he had work (I was sick at the time).\n\n\nThe latest argument was what made things worse. My mom and sister were discussing natural remedies (they're into this stuff) for my niece and Philip (he's a pediatrician) called both of them \"ignorant\" for not using meds instead which caused a huge argument and Philip being no longer welcome at my parents house.\n\n\nNow they'd sent me and Billy an invitation for Christmas but did not include Philip which, I expected given how strained their relationship has become. I called my mom to confirm that I'll attend but the minute Philip found out, he went off saying he could not believe I was fine with my family excluding him and then agree to go and leave him behind. I told him it's their celebration and I don't get to decide their guestlist for them. And also, I'm not leaving him behind because we did not have any plans for Christmas. He said he thought that we'd \"automatically\" celebrate together the 3 of us but now I'm taking Billy away from him as well. I thought that was a bit melodramatic because it's literally just few hours at my parents home but he insisted it was about principle and respect. We had a big argument and I said that he basically alienated himself by continually picking arguments with my family, but he started ranting saying it wasn't about the fact that they didn't invite him, but the fact that I was willing to let him spend Christmas alone without me and Billy.\n\n\nWe went back and forth on the issue but do not seem to reach a solution. My parents are used to spending every major holiday with Billy. So you can see how much pressure I'm getting from both sides here.", "created_utc": 1668857597, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yz9veg/aita_for_accepting_my_familys_christmas/", "score": 389, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Did Philip the pediatrician get off for Christmas (something that may have been hard to come by given healthcare worker and increasing RSV) just so that his new wife and stepson could leave him by himself to go to people who dislike him?

OP, the first story sounds like your dad was TA, like he was lookkng for a bad guy when it was just an unfortunate situation.

Like they couldn't wait to jump at the chance! You need to get your priorities straight and stand up for your husband if you want your marriage to work.

You could have at least asked him before responding. \nI get that you want your son to see his grandparents on Christmas, but they made the decision to exclude his dad.

We got married 4 months ago. For context, I have a 10 yo son \"Billy\" from my previous relationship and my ex isn't in the picture.\n\n\nI have to admit that Philip's relationship with my family isn't so great. They would disagree on a lot of things. For example, he had an argument with my dad when he said that he was keeping their grandson away from them but Philip stated he wasn't and that he couldn't visit with Billy because he had work (I was sick at the time).\n\n\nThe latest argument was what made things worse. My mom and sister were discussing natural remedies (they're into this stuff) for my niece and Philip (he's a pediatrician) called both of them \"ignorant\" for not using meds instead which caused a huge argument and Philip being no longer welcome at my parents house.\n\n\nNow they'd sent me and Billy an invitation for Christmas but did not include Philip which, I expected given how strained their relationship has become. I called my mom to confirm that I'll attend but the minute Philip found out, he went off saying he could not believe I was fine with my family excluding him and then agree to go and leave him behind. I told him it's their celebration and I don't get to decide their guestlist for them. And also, I'm not leaving him behind because we did not have any plans for Christmas. He said he thought that we'd \"automatically\" celebrate together the 3 of us but now I'm taking Billy away from him as well. I thought that was a bit melodramatic because it's literally just few hours at my parents home but he insisted it was about principle and respect. We had a big argument and I said that he basically alienated himself by continually picking arguments with my family, but he started ranting saying it wasn't about the fact that they didn't invite him, but the fact that I was willing to let him spend Christmas alone without me and Billy.\n\n\nWe went back and forth on the issue but do not seem to reach a solution. My parents are used to spending every major holiday with Billy. So you can see how much pressure I'm getting from both sides here.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA. Not only are you wrong about leaving to go spend time with them on Christmas, it sounds like Phillip was in the right with the things he said to them.

The rest either accept him or you don\u2019t go. Alternatively, you and your son go on a different day or a different week if it\u2019s so important to you.

Tell Philip to take a nap and you\u2019ll be be back later. \n\nWhile you\u2019re at Christmas feel free to remind your family that you\u2019re married and Philip is here to stay so out of respect for you they should try to at least be civil with him.", "ESH but your husband is probably the least AH of anyone. He's a 36 year old doctor and he is getting into arguments with your family which he shouldn't do but it sounds like they are trying to bait him into it. They then go a step further and banish him from family holiday celebrations. Your family sucks.\n\nYou then don't communicate with him at all and make plans that don't include him. That sounds a lot like abandoning someone. You also blame him for your family winding him up but at no point have you mentioned trying to stand up for him.
