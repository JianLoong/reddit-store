We got married 4 months ago. For context, I have a 10 yo son \"Billy\" from my previous relationship and my ex isn't in the picture.\n\n\nI have to admit that Philip's relationship with my family isn't so great. They would disagree on a lot of things. For example, he had an argument with my dad when he said that he was keeping their grandson away from them but Philip stated he wasn't and that he couldn't visit with Billy because he had work (I was sick at the time).\n\n\nThe latest argument was what made things worse. My mom and sister were discussing natural remedies (they're into this stuff) for my niece and Philip (he's a pediatrician) called both of them \"ignorant\" for not using meds instead which caused a huge argument and Philip being no longer welcome at my parents house.\n\n\nNow they'd sent me and Billy an invitation for Christmas but did not include Philip which, I expected given how strained their relationship has become. I called my mom to confirm that I'll attend but the minute Philip found out, he went off saying he could not believe I was fine with my family excluding him and then agree to go and leave him behind. I told him it's their celebration and I don't get to decide their guestlist for them. And also, I'm not leaving him behind because we did not have any plans for Christmas. He said he thought that we'd \"automatically\" celebrate together the 3 of us but now I'm taking Billy away from him as well. I thought that was a bit melodramatic because it's literally just few hours at my parents home but he insisted it was about principle and respect. We had a big argument and I said that he basically alienated himself by continually picking arguments with my family, but he started ranting saying it wasn't about the fact that they didn't invite him, but the fact that I was willing to let him spend Christmas alone without me and Billy.\n\n\nWe went back and forth on the issue but do not seem to reach a solution. My parents are used to spending every major holiday with Billy. So you can see how much pressure I'm getting from both sides here.", "created_utc": 1668857597, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yz9veg/aita_for_accepting_my_familys_christmas/", "score": 7857, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Did Philip the pediatrician get off for Christmas (something that may have been hard to come by given healthcare worker and increasing RSV) just so that his new wife and stepson could leave him by himself to go to people who dislike him?

We got married 4 months ago. For context, I have a 10 yo son \"Billy\" from my previous relationship and my ex isn't in the picture.\n\n\nI have to admit that Philip's relationship with my family isn't so great. They would disagree on a lot of things. For example, he had an argument with my dad when he said that he was keeping their grandson away from them but Philip stated he wasn't and that he couldn't visit with Billy because he had work (I was sick at the time).\n\n\nThe latest argument was what made things worse. My mom and sister were discussing natural remedies (they're into this stuff) for my niece and Philip (he's a pediatrician) called both of them \"ignorant\" for not using meds instead which caused a huge argument and Philip being no longer welcome at my parents house.\n\n\nNow they'd sent me and Billy an invitation for Christmas but did not include Philip which, I expected given how strained their relationship has become. I called my mom to confirm that I'll attend but the minute Philip found out, he went off saying he could not believe I was fine with my family excluding him and then agree to go and leave him behind. I told him it's their celebration and I don't get to decide their guestlist for them. And also, I'm not leaving him behind because we did not have any plans for Christmas. He said he thought that we'd \"automatically\" celebrate together the 3 of us but now I'm taking Billy away from him as well. I thought that was a bit melodramatic because it's literally just few hours at my parents home but he insisted it was about principle and respect. We had a big argument and I said that he basically alienated himself by continually picking arguments with my family, but he started ranting saying it wasn't about the fact that they didn't invite him, but the fact that I was willing to let him spend Christmas alone without me and Billy.\n\n\nWe went back and forth on the issue but do not seem to reach a solution. My parents are used to spending every major holiday with Billy. So you can see how much pressure I'm getting from both sides here.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA. Not only are you wrong about leaving to go spend time with them on Christmas, it sounds like Phillip was in the right with the things he said to them.

The rest either accept him or you don\u2019t go. Alternatively, you and your son go on a different day or a different week if it\u2019s so important to you.

I think all sides have earned some blame here as everyone sounds a little intransigent and like they could all be better about talking to each other and doing so respectfully.\n\nIt sounds like your dad blew the Billy-visit situation way out of proportion. It's an overreaction to consider it \"keeping them away from their grandson\" just because they have to reschedule one visit or even a few closely scheduled visits because people are busy/sick.\n\nCalling people ignorant because they consider other treatments isn't a way to endear them to you. I'm a big believer in science and he's a doctor so I would probably agree with him, but, depending on the context, it sounds like he could have blown that way out of proportion too. You didn't say what the niece was dealing with, but I'm going to assume it wasn't something as simple as a cold or using crystals as deodorant. But if the conversation was about something like changing her diet to manage a rheumatoid issue or acid reflux instead of taking steroids or proton pump inhibitors, then I don't think your husband needed to handle it in quite that fashion. If it was more along the lines of a dangerous significantly contagious disease that could result in death if contracted, I can see why he might be more aggressive, but in most cases insulting people isn't usually a good way to convince them to listen to you.\n\nAs for Christmas: you say you aren't surprised by the split invitation while Philip assumed you'd be spending the holiday together with Billy. That sounds like something you should have talked about with him. I can see how you're not surprised and to some extent, maybe he shouldn't have been surprised either since the last time he saw your family they kicked him out of their house. But if you were the one expecting this and it's your family, why didn't you bring this up as a possibility before? Even if you were planning to spend the holiday with your husband, if you expected to even take Billy to his grandparents so he could see them without Phillip there, those are plans you would think you would mention to your husband since they impact his holiday schedule as well.\n\nI do think he could chill a bit though too. There are plenty of families who put emphasis on different elements of the holidays and those things evolve as families grow and change. When my extended family lived largely together in two homes, Christmas was a largely communal, two-day event, with different family members sometimes coming to stay for several days. As people grew up and started their only families, that has developed into (usually) Christmas Eve dinner (and sometimes gift exchange) while Christmas Day is spent within individual households. My dad is big on Christmas breakfast with immediate family; my mom is big on the extended family dinner, which dad sometimes skips. (INFO: I think we need to know how you and Philip have spent the past two Christmases to get a better sense of if your going to your parents for a few hours is not a big deal as you say or a huge deal as he says.)\n\n**But honestly, for all of the adults involved across the board:** ***Learn to communicate and compromise.***\n\nMaybe you figured a few hours with your parents wouldn't be a huge deal for him. And maybe it wouldn't be if it was moved to Christmas Eve or something. And maybe he should have had enough foresight to know that after significant fights with your family throughout the year, they might be willing to not include him in their holiday celebration. But maybe they would have thought twice if you had spoken up. And maybe both your husband and your family could apologize for their roles in making what could have been minor disagreements into a full fledged family war and everyone could spend Christmas together and acknowledge that being in a family means not always getting your way or being \"right\" on every single thing.", "YTA you\u2019re going to leave your husband alone on Christmas???

But (I know I will be downvoted for this is predominately western sub) I do disagree with the blanket bashing of all natural remedies.

Also, when you say that Philip, your pediatrician husband, called your mom and sister ignorant, that needs context.

I spent the first 15 years of my marriage traveling to my in-laws' houses every. single. holiday. to the point that I grew to loathe any holiday. My husband refused to see the stress it left me with the entire time surrounding and during the occasion. The year my now 13 year old was born, she was exclusively breastfed and refused bottles of anything. The debate became nurse the baby while he drove on the interstate or we stopped every hour and a half to nurse the baby which would extend the drive from 6 hours to 8 or 9 hours depending on how hungry the child got. I absolutely refused to nurse while he drove for obvious reasons. I told him I would rather just not go at all and let him take the older kids to his mom's house. That was another lead balloon. He refused to stop when we needed to feed her and extend the drive time. So he decided we would not go at all. I was 10000% fine with that as I'd been begging him for years to allow me to be home for at least some of the holidays. I cooked Thanksgiving, invited my parents to our house, and we had a very relaxing day. I fully expected my husband to want to travel for Christmas, and I was willing to compromise. By that point the baby would have been nursing a little less frequently and we could time things to only need to stop once. However, he decided we would not travel. We have not traveled for holidays nearly as much since then. We now always host Thanksgiving because we have such a large family of our own. But for Christmas, if I don't see my grandbabies because they are at another loved one's house or their own house, it will not be the end of my world.

My husband has to work so he's not going, but we're doing Friendsgiving with his sister tomorrow.", "In my extended family you don't need invitations, not even a call, just show up at anytime during Christmas and there will be a seat and food for you. Many Christmases ago we used to do a Christmas tour visiting all my uncle's and aunts from my father and mother's sides, we eat a lot... \n\nSadly since then a lot of them passed away and family tours have gotten shorter because those large family gatherings are not so common now, but still we do a couple visits each Christmas \u26c4", ">And if a person isn't specifically mentioned in the invitation, they're not welcome, like they have a bouncer at the door checking the cards?\n\nNahh.. 99 % of the time, as long as the carriages check out, the manservants will just let them in.", "yup...i've never seen anything like that from my family.  the weirdest i've seen was when my SIL wanted us to call her and ask for permission to show up... my brother was very mad at her.", "pretty much what i thought.  dude needs to get out of there for his own sake.", "It doesn\u2019t absolve OP, but I think such a family culture may be highly relevant to her learned behaviors", "You mean he\u2019s spying on you on Al Gore\u2019s public internet?!?! Well now you\u2019re definitely justified in spending Xmas doing a homeopathic ritual with people who hate him because he has a job.", "Holy shit, this is their FIRST Christmas together??!  I missed that part, I assumed they'd been married for a while. She's merrily skipping their first Christmas as husband and wife.\n\nSomeone's getting divorce papers for the holidays.", "Yeah, and I don't think OP realizes that if her husband divorces her this quickly, she's not entitled to alimony.", "Oh no not the alkaline water. Don\u2019t even get me started on that nonsense.", "I appreciate the upvote!  Don\u2019t waste money on virtual awards.", "Phone call? We get a text!", "We get a group text from my aunt who usually arranges things, and it always devolves into everyone sending crass gifs back and forth. It's basically tradition at this point.", "They hate him because he doesn\u2019t jump when they tell him too. They can\u2019t control him and he speaks his mind. He doesn\u2019t let them bully him.", "Lol\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "My lurker spouse pulls up my old comments and reads them to me sometimes. \n\nI *did* think it was sweet, but now...\n\n*side-eye*", "My Nana still brewed tea from willow bark when I was a kid and it worked better than Tylenol- but that\u2019s just bc willow is high in Salicylic acid. Herbalism shouldn\u2019t be approached by lay people. If you\u2019re not a botanist, contact your medical professional *before* rubbing your kids down with something from the garden. EDIT to add that lavender and chamomile make a great night time rub for babies. The smell\u2019s relaxing- but J&J sells the stuff. No need to break out the gardening gloves.", "Honey and lemon for sore throats, vaccines for whooping cough", "Omg we have the same plans! Guess I better go write up an invite so my husband and kids know we have plans and don't try to ditch me!", "I called my mom yesterday just to ask about how deep their pie plates are and what ingredients they already had lol. Apparently I'm the only one making apple pies for Thanksgiving for at least 30 people.", "Just put sweet potato in the chat and then put it on ignore", "I like to make a pumpkin cheesecake topped with a pumpkin chiffon. Guaranteed crowd pleaser.", "A phone call is definitely the preferred option over trying to decipher my grandmother\u2019s texting attempts lol", "This gave me a chuckle. Just for future reference though, being from a different culture isn't usually a big issue if the parties are open and interested in learning about each others cultures. I say this as an African who also really cherishes some aspects of my culture and who's dated people from other countries without issues :) so if your brother has a Nigerian lady doctor coworker and you hit it off, I say go for it! You'll learn some awesome recipes at the very least lol", "I had a doctor that would prescribe meds when need, alternatives when needed. Great doctor.", "Try peppermint herbal tea with honey and lemon for sore throat. The peppermint has menthol that will help open your airways, the honey soothes the throat, and the lemon reduces the swelling.\n\nAnd it tastes nice, and none of it will interfere with whatever actual meds you may be taking for strep throat or whatever.", "I always use St Johns Wort as an example when doctors say herbal medicine does nothing. The list of interactions with that stuff is huge.", "I\u2019ll go change his locks for free. My SO would come with me.", "Not gonna lie, it's already on mute, they were giving me away too often at work. Chatty Kathys the lot of them.", "Well, that\u2019s just rude.  How dare he?!", "My wife just experienced a nasty side-effect from combining meds. Pharmacist tried to warn us, but the doctor said \u201cit should be ok.\u201d  Big nope on that one. From here on out, we\u2019re giving a little more weight to the pharmacist\u2019s notes.", "A great example of this being St John's Wort, and hormonal birth control. St John's can significantly reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives.", "Here to second this! I have a long list of chronic illnesses (stemming from a genetic disorder) and therefore, an even longer list of long-term medications. Any time I start something new, for any reason, I ask my regular pharmacist to go through the list for me and make sure it's not going to interact with anything. Several times in just the past year, she's saved me from potentially serious harm and sent me back to my GP or specialist for an alternative medication. Always has recommendations, too.\n\nPharmacists are the experts on meds, supplements, herbal remedies, etc. and how they can interact.", "Take my poor woman's award \ud83c\udfc6 This is so true. The pharmaceutical science as we know it today literally has its roots in ancient natural medicine, so the two very much go hand-in-hand. It's just wild to me how people treat doctors like they're witches in Salem or something.", "Same, I never understood the all or nothing approach. There is absolutely a  way to have a healthy balance between herbal remedies and medications when necessary.  Sore throat: lemon ginger tea with honey. Cough with cold: hot tottie and some Tylenol. Sinus infection : prednisone. \nI have bad anxiety related to hospitals. Needed a procedure and while they were getting me anti anxiety meds for IV a nurse put a lavender oil patch on me \u2018 to help calm my nerves\u2019. \n\nI said no thanks but she\u2019d already attached to me. It did nothing but now make me associate lavender scented stuff with suffering and anxiety\ud83d\ude43", "Or the fact that they get a sample of blood and finger and hand prints at birth?!", "I had a manager tell me the virus wasn't real and it was all political propaganda. (my mom's an elective surgery surgical nurse and was bounced from unit to unit during the worst of the pandemic, and saw it all) I lost it, told him what my m does, how she sees hundreds of patients die on ventilators and their families not be able to be with them. Only to say good bye via video chats.\nThose who never believed and still don't drive me insane, especially the anti-vaxers!", "Like the government would EVER be that efficient\u2026", "i literally work in a doctor\u2019s office and one of my doctors does exactly this for patients with complicated medicine regimens who are seeing multiple specialists. the moment you feel you feel overwhelmed or unsure about the safety of something, always double check with your pharmacy team.", "I once asked my doctor about a potential side effect of a medication. It was a rarer one, not a well known one. He looked it up right in front of me to double check. I respected that. A lot of doctors would be too prideful. He can\u2019t remember every single potential side effect of every medication. I was very happy that he did that.", "In what form do you take ginger? One of my kids gets nausea from IBS, and I would love to share this with them.", "If you aren't limiting sugar, try crystallized ginger."]}
