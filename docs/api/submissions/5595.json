We will be getting married eventually but it's not a priority. \n\nMy mom won't let us share a bed if we come see them for any reason.  When we came over this last summer my boyfriend suggested renting a hotel so we could have privacy and a comfortable bed. It drove my mom nuts that we bypassed her ittle rules.  She wouldn't drop it the entire time we were there.  She made me promise not to do that again.  \n\nMy boyfriend's mom and dad are retired to Mexico and they are really chill. So we made plans to come visit them over Christmas.  They are not Christian so they don't really care when they see their son with regards to religious holidays.  \n\nWe didn't tell my parents we weren't coming. My mom asked me at Thanksgiving if I was going to hold to my promise not to stay at a hotel over Christmas.  I answered truthfully that I would not stay at a hotel.  \n\nI am sitting here on the balcony of my future in-laws condo looking at the Carribean waiting for sunrise and enjoying the peace and quiet.  I made the mistake of going online yesterday and I saw a bunch of posts from my mom and my sisters about how I was a jerk for lying to them about my plans.  \n\nI may have been a little tipsy last night because I decided to respond.  I said that it was ridiculous of them to try and tell me I couldn't share a room with my boyfriend, that I was keeping my promise by not staying at a hotel when we were there, and that if they planned on putting everything on Facebook I would be avoiding all visits for the foreseeable future.  \n\nThey took down their posts when people started crapping on them for trying to control me.  But some people did agree with them. \n\nNow they are texting me and calling to say I was an asshole for making them look bad.  I asked them if they were trying to make me look good with their posts?  They stopped for a while but there were more texts and voice mail this morning.   I'm kind of liking the idea of skipping out on the drama from now on. But I miss my dad and he is blameless in this. \n\nAITA?\n\n#EDIT\n\nI'm having trouble wrapping my head around a couple of things that keep being repeated.  \n\n1.

You should have just told them that was the plan, and let them have their little hissy fit before the holiday. Regardless of how ridiculous your mom is, I'm sure she was hurt to find out her daughter hadn't been honest with her about the Christmas plans.

While that's not my belief and I don't like it, i respect them, their beliefs and their home and would always abide by that.\n\nGetting a hotel instead if sleeping together was that important during your stay (no judgement for that at all) was the correct answer. There is no way they could have stopped you doing this again. You could have just laughed them off and booked it anyway. It sounds like they wanted to see you badly enough that they were going to cast you out or not see you if you did it.\n\nInstead, you let them believe you would be spending Christmas, an important time of year for them, with them as a family, and then simply didn't turn up. While they shouldn't have taken to social media to air their feelings, it's not like you chose to speak to them about yours or your plans so I don't really see that you can complain.\n\nYou all need to grow up and communicate.

Not \"cold\" face, but stone-like, resolute, stating facts and not reacting emotionally. You cannot respond to their prodding and bait. It's like acting wounded in front of a hungry predator. \n\nYou tell them your intentions and boundaries; depending on how the conversation goes exactly. You tell them that you don't appreciate their behavior, it goes against so-and-so that you discussed or that you \"understand\" their feedback but you will be doing this or that instead. \n\nIf they push back harder, you tell them you can speak later when they've had time to process the conversation but you have things to do. I would end the conversation there. They'll likely say something hurtful at that point; it's in their nature to lash out when they don't get their way.

Their removal is the only way full impact of their abnormality and how it affected you will be realized even where you currently know something is wrong.", "Period. Both my parents are narcissist.
