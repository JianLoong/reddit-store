We will be getting married eventually but it's not a priority. \n\nMy mom won't let us share a bed if we come see them for any reason.  When we came over this last summer my boyfriend suggested renting a hotel so we could have privacy and a comfortable bed. It drove my mom nuts that we bypassed her ittle rules.  She wouldn't drop it the entire time we were there.  She made me promise not to do that again.  \n\nMy boyfriend's mom and dad are retired to Mexico and they are really chill. So we made plans to come visit them over Christmas.  They are not Christian so they don't really care when they see their son with regards to religious holidays.  \n\nWe didn't tell my parents we weren't coming. My mom asked me at Thanksgiving if I was going to hold to my promise not to stay at a hotel over Christmas.  I answered truthfully that I would not stay at a hotel.  \n\nI am sitting here on the balcony of my future in-laws condo looking at the Carribean waiting for sunrise and enjoying the peace and quiet.  I made the mistake of going online yesterday and I saw a bunch of posts from my mom and my sisters about how I was a jerk for lying to them about my plans.  \n\nI may have been a little tipsy last night because I decided to respond.  I said that it was ridiculous of them to try and tell me I couldn't share a room with my boyfriend, that I was keeping my promise by not staying at a hotel when we were there, and that if they planned on putting everything on Facebook I would be avoiding all visits for the foreseeable future.  \n\nThey took down their posts when people started crapping on them for trying to control me.  But some people did agree with them. \n\nNow they are texting me and calling to say I was an asshole for making them look bad.  I asked them if they were trying to make me look good with their posts?  They stopped for a while but there were more texts and voice mail this morning.

But instead of saying, \"I won't be spending Christmas with you this year, I'm going to the in-laws,  and if I come to you again, we will stay in a hotel,\" you lied in such a way that they thought you'd be attending. Instead of acting in the adult manner in which you want to be treated, you behaved like a kid.", "NTA, I have tried to get my partner to do something similar but she won\u2019t piss her parents off to that extent.", "Even though I feel a bit bad that your mom did extra prep work that she didn't end up needing to do, I think you're NTA.\n\nI do wonder, though...is your dad always such a doormat? And what's the deal with your sisters that they seem to side with your mom as well?", "I can understand them not wanting you and your BF to be rocking the room in their house, but it\u2019s ridiculous that they demand you not get a hotel. \n\nEverybody involved are adults and everybody has to understand that everybody does the horizontal tango.

They tried to control you and play \u201coN tHeiR rUlEs\u201d so you just decided to outplay them. Very good move congratulations and you can talk to your dad any meet him without your mom and sisters.", "INFO: why didn\u2019t you just tell them you wouldn\u2019t be there for Christmas?", "N T A for wanting to be treated like an adult with your own relationship. YTA for not giving them a heads up if this is the largest point of contention. They are dramatic, you too are dramatic. It would probably have saved some of the drama to let them know that you had other Xmas plans.", "YTA. It wasn't a problem to do what you wanted to do. I hope you enjoy your holiday. But being an adult means being upfront. Your answer when asked may not have technically been a lie, but it was deceptive.", "YTA - for not sharing the information that you don\u2018t visit on Christmas - this is just cruel. Does your mum has a right to make you not share a bed in the house - unfortunately yes - it is her house. But she can\u2018t dictate if you stay somewhere else or not - this is bullshit - either she insists on her rule and you stay somewhere else or she skips the rule to have you there - it is her choice but she has to deal with the consequences.", "ESH, honestly.\n\nYour mom is ridiculous to say that you can't sleep in the same bed with your boyfriend under her roof *and* get pissed when you decide to go to a hotel instead. She needs to either let you stay in the same bed with your boyfriend under her roof or accept that you're staying in a hotel because she won't.\n\nIt wasn't fair for you to give them the impression you would be there for Christmas and then not show up. You should have just told them that was the plan, and let them have their little hissy fit before the holiday. Regardless of how ridiculous your mom is, I'm sure she was hurt to find out her daughter hadn't been honest with her about the Christmas plans. The rest of your family was probably confused/hurt as well.\n\nPutting the whole thing on FB, despite everything, was another sucky move.", "ESH. You should have at least told them you were not coming. You knowingly lead your mom on about spending the holiday with them. Everything else might have been avoided. Your mom and sister are A for posting on facebook and harassing you while you\u2019re spending time with your boyfriends family. I don\u2019t get why you have to miss your dad, can you not hang out with him without your mom/sister? Good luck to you.", "ESH. I was very much on your side. It's perfectly acceptable for you to want to share a bed with your bf and stay in a hotel to do so but you've handled this poorly. You were deliberately misleading when they were making Christmas plans. I'm curious, at what point did you actually tell them you were spending Christmas elsewhere?", "NTA 100%\n\nI would go NC. This is one of the very few situations where I would do so because as you said they do not treat you like an adult that you are and they are attempting to control you. And no amount of communication will change that.\n\nNeither childish, immature, cult-like behavior is okay in my book.", "NTA. I'm really not seeing where you did anything but being honest. Your mother made a lot of assumptions, I can't see she even invited you to come for Christmas? You told her honestly you would not be staying in a hotel. And being honest that if she plays stupid games she will win stupid prizes is perfectly reasonable.", "INFO: \n\nIs there a reason you didn\u2019t just tell them upfront that you would be spending christmas with your boyfriend\u2019s family?\n\nThey\u2019re assholes for trying to control you like that, but I don\u2019t really see what you gained by misleading them about your plans", "I can't believe all the N T As.\n\nYTA.\n\nYou're a grown ass adult that wants to be treated like one but are behaving like a child.\nIt's your parents house and their rules while you are a guest there. My partners parents request the same, that we don't share a bed in their home until we are married. While that's not my belief and I don't like it, i respect them, their beliefs and their home and would always abide by that.\n\nGetting a hotel instead if sleeping together was that important during your stay (no judgement for that at all) was the correct answer. There is no way they could have stopped you doing this again. You could have just laughed them off and booked it anyway. It sounds like they wanted to see you badly enough that they were going to cast you out or not see you if you did it.\n\nInstead, you let them believe you would be spending Christmas, an important time of year for them, with them as a family, and then simply didn't turn up. While they shouldn't have taken to social media to air their feelings, it's not like you chose to speak to them about yours or your plans so I don't really see that you can complain.\n\nYou all need to grow up and communicate. Life's too short to behave like this, who knows how many Christmasses you have left to spend together.\n\nEdit: obviously they don't think YTA just for making them look bad. You behaviour in the run up to the post has hurt them. That's why.", "NTA. As for looking bad, they made themselves look bad. \"Controlling\" is a bad colour on most people. I do think, however, you should have been upfront to your relatives and just told them where you were going for Christmas.", "Nta", "NTA. It looks as though you weren\u2019t actually invited for Christmas; they assumed you were coming.", "Nta. They started it with their Facebook post.\n\nNever understood the sleep in separate bedrooms thing if they know you\u2019re living together.", "Soft ESH. Tbh you would have done yourself a favor by letting them know you were going and why beforehand, because that\u2019s the only thing you did that was rude and that would have left them nothing to legitimately complain about. \n\nAs for everything else, your trip with your bf sounds way more fun and my rule of thumb for someone \u201clooking bad online\u201d is they can shut the fuck up about it if they were the ones who decided to post about it online to begin with.\n\nAnd if your mom is anything like my mom, the amount of \u201cprep work\u201d time she wasted was grossly over exaggerated.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Instead of doing Christmas plans, all the adults spent the evening calling police stations and hospitals trying to find her. Eventually she was located with a friend of a friend's sister or something like that. It was so late the kids were all asleep and Christmas was basically over. \n\nIf you want to be an emotionally mature adult, you're going to have to say what you mean, mean what you say, and learn how to hold your boundaries firmly and respectfully. Your family won't respond to omissions, public shaming, or a taste of their own medicine. You're not an asshole for doing your own thing, or even for not knowing how to handle this gracefully (took me 30 years). But you did make some mistakes in how you handled this. Instead of seeing you as an adult making your own decisions the way you did this makes them see you like a conniving child who lied about where they were supposed to be. \n\nYou're not going to get what you want by stooping to the levels of emotionally immature people, but you can by being the mature one in the storm. I understand not wanting to hear the guilt trip, BELIEVE ME, but by not actually communicating a boundary and then enforcing it, you didn't solve anything you just dug a bigger hole. Now instead of bugging you about the hotel room you'll have to hear jibes about disappearing.

It was the fact she wasn't upfront and honest about her plans.  She knew she was misleading her family and so purposely.  That came across as petulant and childish.

Throw in that her only communication was through drunken posts...yeah....really grown up and mature.", "Start acting like one? When did she not?
