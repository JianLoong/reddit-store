We'd been wanting to see this artist for a while now. So a month before the concert she invited a mutual coworker to the concert as well. I didn't mind at all.\n\n So here's where things got weird. Everyday she brings up our coworker to me at the strangest times. She'll interrupt our conversations or a movie I'm watching to bring her up. I just ignored it. So about three weeks before the concert she tells me that she and the coworker have picked out a section and tells me which seat to buy. This already upset me because why was I not included in this process? But I ignored it not wanting to be petty and bought the ticket. Now we're at the concert. She and the coworker are talking the entire time while she probably spoke to me three times and each time the coworker interrupted and she would just start talking to her instead.\nAt the end of the show we get up to leave everyone is directing me to my right. As I'm waiting for it to clear I hear the girl next to me say \"your friends really just left you.\" So I look to my right and sure enough they're going the opposite way and no one even tried to tell me. Anyway I get out of the arena and spot them I think they'll have the decency to wait somewhere for me or at least look around...no they continued to walk and never looked around or anything to signal they were looking for me. I stop for a few minutes still thinking they'll stop they don't.\nSo I decide to just walk to the car it's when I'm literally half way to the car so about 5 minutes later when she texts me asking where I'm at.Then says they're in a bathroom there are about 10 bathrooms in this arena and besides why wasn't I told earlier that that's where they were headed? I tell her I'm at the car and now she's saying they're lost and can't find the car. I tell her I don't know how to give the directions because I'm not sure wher she's exactly at but that it was near the porta potties had passed earlier. She then gets frustrated and to demands me to send my location rudely instead of asking.\n\nI'm standing by her car in 20 degree weather with men cat calling, people running past me, and cars speeding through to leave for almost 30 minutes when they finally appear. They don't apologize or even ask if I'm okay they just laugh and hop into the car. The entire car ride I'm silent and just staring off in the distance while she begins to drive manically at the direction of the coworker. After witnessing a terrible crash she pulls over and lets the coworker drive her car (a car she refuses to let her sister drive and has never let me either when we've gone out of town claiming it's cause we're not on her insurance) she had just told me the girl can't drive and it's safe to say that she can't.\n\nNow it's two days later and she still hasn't acknowled' what happened instead she's just ignoring me so I'm doing the same. I just feel my safety was put at risk twice that night.

They've gotten close quickly, she wants to talk about her all the time, they disappear together (the bathroom), she neglects existing friendships for her, she places a disproportionate level of trust in her (the car)... lots of signs. Try not to take it personally but your friend should definitely apologise as its not an excuse to treat you badly. Sounds like they are in that intense first flush phase where the only person that matters to them is each other and your friend is blindsided.

I know it is easier said then done but if they are displaying similar behaviour to this especially on multiple occasions you need new friends!", "NTA. She's not your friend.", "NTA. Your friend clearly disregarded your feelings and treated you poorly throughout the entire concert experience. It's not petty to expect basic courtesy and respect from someone you consider a friend. Your safety should never be compromised, and it's understandable that you're upset about the situation.", "so your friend is crushing hard on that girl and being super inconsiderate? hows that your fault? she just doesnt want to face her own terrible behavior and not talking is easier. \n\nNTA but your friend is kinda useless, more like a fair weather friend", "You are not petty and NTA. There is a very clear lack of respect towards you. As a female I would never leave another female friend by themselves in larger crowds (especially those which likely involve alcohol). I would start to look for some new friends.", "NTA- This is a reminder of how mean women can be. If she\u2019s ignoring you over this maybe she has a different view of what transpired that evening. You should communicate how you felt you were being treated. Let her explain why she was behaving like an AH and if you\u2019re not happy with her response then drop her ass from your list of friends.", "nta. period.", "NTA, and unfortunately it seems like the coworker has become very important to her for some reason.  Yes, you were put at risk a few times that night.  A possible approach is to hang out with other friends and look for other roommate situations.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Also, I think you have two choices:\n\n1. Address the problem and see if it can be worked out.\n2. Realize you're not as good friends as you thought you were and adjust your way of feeling and acting. She's your roommate. You're friendly and polite. When you go out to have fun, it's not with her. If you have friends over to hang out, she's not included. Stop talking to her about your feelings, secrets, and important things. She's like someone you talk to at the watercooler. Downgrade her from friend to roommate.", "EXACTLY, simple as that. Friends don't treat you like that!", "Straight or otherwise, doesn't matter. She treated you badly, there's no excuse for that, she's not the friend you thought she was.\n\nWhat you do with that info is up to you, but pulling back from the friendship would be reasonable. After all, she's already pulled back from you. That doesn't necessarily mean LC or NC, just dropping her to a lower level of relationship.", "Is she like this with other friends or specifically just her?", "NTA. It may not be a sexual crush (although methinks she may protest too much...) it could be that she just for some reason has fallen hard for this person's \"vibe\"\n\nquotelet from a story I read about RWBY: \"Your entire family is Ruby-sexual!\" where it was about the person, rather than the package.", "Oh I definitely agree! I don\u2019t care about her sexuality at all I was just responding to the person who asked. Plus she\u2019s always adamant about saying she\u2019s straight and I never ask or question her about it because it\u2019s none of my concern or business. \n\nI\u2019ve already pulled back from her it\u2019s just a bit difficult since we\u2019re roommates", "Specifically just her"]}
