If you hear \u201cmotorcycle crash\u201d and \u201cserious,\u201d the appropriate response isn\u2019t, \u201cEh, I\u2019m sure my sister\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\nSomething needs to be done about your mother\u2019s overdramatic tendencies, tho.", "NAH.\n\nA pretty tough situation to be in. But, you aren't a doctor so not sure why you were required to be there immediately?\n\nMom was stupidly dramatic, you should've clarified the situation.\n\nEdit: guys I posted this before any mention of an accident", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry it\u2019s in this situation that no matter what you did, you were going to upset someone. Your mum is TA for being overly dramatic and your wife should not make you choose between your sister and her, that\u2019s unfair. \n\nI would wait till she calms down slightly and have a gentle conversation about this, acknowledge her anxiety and how you want to be there - and you are. This may be like this though throughout the whole pregnancy\u2026.", "NTA. i get her anxiety is really bad, but you thought there was an emergency with a family member. that is excusable", "Nah.\n\nIt could have gone both ways. Now you know that your sister was not seriously injured but at the time you did not and chose accordingly. \n\nIt sucks that you missed the appointment but apparently nothing too mlbad happened. But your wife is  high risk pregnant and I can not imagine the anxiety she's going through. And anxiety sometimes manifests itself in lashing out to the person near you.", "NTA as far as you know your sister could have been dying, your wife's ire should be on your mother's shoulders not yours.", "It doesn't sound like pregnancy hormones. She is suffering from complications and was left with a hard to manage child with autism. How long was her appointment, and could you have done both? Did you even consider your child, too? I understand going to the hospital and even keeping tabs on your sister during your wife's appointment. The fact that you completely disregarded your immediate family might be why she's pissed.", "This is a tough one. If your wife has anxiety about the pregnancy, you really need to prioritize being there for her and helping ease her anxiety. I completely understand your decision making with the info you had, just be careful moving forward. Sincerely apologize and promise to put her first and be there for her.\n\nUltimately going to say NAH\u2026\n\nBe careful, my wife had a lot of resentment and years of working through this for a somewhat similar situation. She completely felt abandoned and lost trust in me. Fair or not, it can really strain a relationship. Try to imagine the fear and anxiety she is feeling. She needs you.", "NTA, you didn't know the injury wasn't serious. I understand that your wife is having a stressful time, but she seems completely self centered and unresponsive to reason. You did not miss the appointment on purpose. If your sister was seriously injured, it makes complete sense for you to visit her. Hopefully, you work things out with your wife if this is an unexpected response on her part.", "I'm going with NTA.  Had I gotten a call like that, my wife, with her in the OB GYN's office, she'd have told me to go.  And with what you'd been given I think you should have.", "Info : if you know your mom has tends to be overdramatic, did it cross your mind to try find out from someone else what condition your sister was really in?\n\nI'm going to lean towards NAH though, with maybe the exception of your mom who mislead you with her dramatics.", "NTA - That said, apologize to your wife. She's dealing with a lot and needs your support...hormones are massively high, now is not the time to not be there. I understand wanting to be there for a serious accident for a family member, but unless they are going into the icu, I would suggest keeping your wife, new baby, and child as first priority. As someone else pointed out, there's nothing you could've done for your sister except sit in a waiting room with your mother, meanwhile you could be very helpful to your wife. I may get downvoted and others may disagree, but that's my 2 cents", "YTA if you don't immediately take major steps to get out from your mother's thumb. This should be a huge wake-up call that you need STRONG boundaries with your mother. It sounds like this was not the first time she has lied to get you to prioritize her, and it won't be the last. \n\nFrom now on, you don't get to believe anything your mother says if it would at all be of detriment to your wife. You don't drop everything without confirmation from a TRUSTED source that whatever crisis she has concocted is real. She says someone's dying? Get confirmation from a second source. Your mother is not a trustworthy person, and you know it, so don't torpedo your marriage for her.\n\nETA: Whatever was happening with your sister, she wasn't completely alone, your mother was there. Your wife, on the other hand, was left completely alone. YOUR wife. YOUR partner.", "NAH. If she acts like this outside of pregnancies, then you'd have a problem. But this seems pretty understandable that you had no good choices to make in that situation.", "This is a tough situation it\u2019s like a mixture of an ah and no ah. You knew your mom is over dramatic but she did say a motorcycle accident and that sounds scary you reacted out of fear. However telling your wife well you didn\u2019t find out anything was wrong isn\u2019t the right thing to say especially when she is upset. Your wife was alone with a crying child on top of pregnancy she wanted your support.", "This is a tough one. However in this case I'm going to say YTA. You know your mom is prone to be dramatic and over exaggerate things. Sounds like your mom might have some narcisistic tendencies. Depends on weather or not when she exaggerates these things she ends up drawing the attention onto herself of look at poor me.... Saying this because my grandmother was just like that. \n\nYou also know how high risk the pregnancy of your wife is. The least you could have done is take your son with you, so she could at least have a peaceful appointment alone or find a last minute sitter. Last thing she needs is more stress with an already high risk pregnancy. This is the life of your unborn child you're putting in more risk than it needs to be by stressing your wife out like all hell.", "YTA. Your sister was not alone, but your wife was, with a high-risk pregnancy and a high-needs kid. You left your wife high and dry at the beck and call of your mother, who is 'known to be dramatic', to rush to your sister's side in the hospital without even knowing what was going on, and you're trying to frame your wife being upset about this as *her* being dramatic.\n\nIt's not hormones. Recalibrate your priorities, dude.", "Let me get this straight, you prioritized you sister over your pregnant wife?\n\nNow you wondering why your wife is angry with you? Gee, I wonder why..\n\nYTA", "NAH, except for your Mother. Honestly, if I heard \u201csister\u201d, \u201cmotorcycle crash\u201d and \u201cserious\u201d I\u2019d have done exactly what you did; my rational brain wouldn\u2019t have been able to kick in to ask \u201chmm can I trust that this isn\u2019t as serious?\u201d. You made a very difficult judgement call and unfortunately, it was the wrong one but I don\u2019t believe the call was in bad faith. Your wife is talking about hypotheticals on her side with the baby, but there are those for you too; what if it had been serious and it was your last chance to see your sister?\nThat being said, I think you owe your wife an apology for adding to her stress, not considering your family when you made the decision to drive 40+ mins away and not taking a second to assess the validity of your mother\u2019s claims. \nI\u2019d also be interested to know whether this has happened before? Does your mother have a habit of dragging you away from your family for \u201cemergencies\u201d; your wife\u2019s reaction was intense, and aside from pregnancy hormones/anxiety, I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s also a precedent of things like this happening before?\nA final note; you should also look at contingency planning for appointments in the future; do you have friends or loved ones nearby who could watch your son? Is there someone else your wife would trust to be at an appointment with her if you can\u2019t make it? I wonder if having these measures in place would help reduce your wife\u2019s anxiety and make her feel less reliant on your decisions. I imagine a lot of her anger is coming from feeling helpless/dependent and it\u2019s going to take time and effort from you to rebuild her trust.\nWishing you and your wife all the luck for the pregnancy and birth.", "Yes. YTA. Your pregnant wife and son needed you. You could have gone to the appointment and then gone to visit your sister. Or at least touched base with your mom (who you\u2019ve acknowledged is overly dramatic) to get an update.\n\nThe fact that you doubled down on your choice instead of trying to understand your wife\u2019s anxiety and simply apologized and committed to being there for her is ridiculous.", "[deleted]", "NTA. It feels like a tough situation to be in. \n\nThis hits a little too close to home to our family as we lost my BiL 8 years ago (today\u2019s date) in a motorcycle accident. Hope you work things out with your wife.", "YTA. Your wife is in a high risk pregnancy, she and your unborn child need to be a priority.", "NTA.  You were in a no-win situation.  You weren't obligated to go to either hospital, but you were expected to by various women.  You couldn't cut yourself in half to go to both hospitals.  So you were definitely going to piss off somebody.\n\nI think your wife needs to cut you some slack.  With what you knew before you left home, you made the difficult but logical and correct choice.", "NTA - An impossible choice to make. I would have taken dieing family member over routine appointments. Ignore her for a few hours, she will soon stop nagging", "NTA.

Yeah I was anxious (I spend the year running on auto drive, because life does go on), but I didn't take it out on my husband and child. My husband had to miss most of my appointments, so I made arrangements for the toddler to go to daycare or have the grandparents watch her. I got admitted to the hospital 3 times, for a total of 22 days. It sucked. It was awful, but none of it was his fault. \nTo top it all of my waters broke a week before my scheduled c-section and I went to the hospital thinking it was just another bleeding, expecting to bed home at the end of the day again. So my husband dropped me off and went to work. When all my blood clots had been flushed out and I suddenly started losing clear fluid is when everyone started panicking. A normal delivery was impossible die to my complications, so I had to get an emergency c-section. I called my husband and the idiot had turned off his cell phone. So I called his school and made the genator get him from his classroom. I totally panicked when I could not get a good of my husband though. That the receptionist could even understand me through my tears is amazing. I don't hold a grudge against my husband for turning off the sound from his phone though. He was also expecting the bleeding to stop again and for me to be sent home. At some point you get so used to the medical emergency status that you stop functioning like it's a medical emergency and you just go on with your life as normal.\nI'm going to get therapy to work through my trauma and in the mean time I'm doing the best I can to not take it out on others. It's my anxiety and my trauma to deal with. \nI understand that your wife has anxiety and this whole pregnancy is traumatic for her. Life does however continue to happen and when a real emergency happens you are allowed to respond to it.

You were told she was in a major accident. While your wife is high risk, it was a routine weekly appointment. I\u2019d be pissed if my husband heard a family member was in the hospital and chose to go to a routine appointment with me instead. It sucks but shit happens. I\u2019m glad your sister is okay and your wife\u2019s appointment seemed to have gone well. I think everyone is heavily focused on the idea that you know your mom is dramatic but there\u2019s honestly no way to tell. imagine if you brushed it off as your mom being dramatic and your sister was actually in life threatening condition? then you\u2019d be the AH for not being by her side. it\u2019s kind of a lose lose situation.

You left out info from the post about your sisters accident, but spend alot of time insulting your wife's fears. She's carrying your kid and you act as if its not a big deal.

Also the challenge associated with your son during these times.  However its a regular appointment and while you have been there for all the others it should be ok to miss one if its for something serious.\n\nAs you said your sister was in a motorbike accident.

You are definitely not an asshole. You sound like someone who is very conscientious about helping those around you. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to choose among competing needs and you made a reasonable choice given the info you had.\n\nOn the other hand, after my twins were born, it would often be overwhelming to take care of them in certain situations. If I was counting on help from my husband and he wasn\u2019t able to, I would get very upset at him. (Usually it wasn\u2019t for as good a reason as you had). I think it\u2019s important that you  acknowledge the struggles she is having getting to appointments in time with your son and also the anxiety that previous losses have caused her. Maybe turn the focus into mutually addressing those valid difficulties shes having. As this situation has shown, her relying on you and only you to help with these issues doesn\u2019t work 100% of the time so you may need to build a more resilient support network or get other kinds of help.", "NAH, but there are multiple problems here that you shouldn't let fester.\n\nYour mom will say whatever is necessary to get the reaction she wants. If your sister only had a concussions and dislocatd knee, than there was no mistaking that situation for a \"serious motorcycle accident.\" (On that note, your sister should stop riding a motorcycle since otherwise she'll probably be back in the hospital in the next year.) In this case, your mom misrepresented the facts because she wanted YOU to freak out with her. Not permanently, but for a couple of months while you get this situation sorted out, I would consider blocking your mom's phone number.

When I was in an accident last year where I got rear ended and my car totaled I called my dad almost right away at the scene. The first thing I said was \"I'm okay, but I was just in an accident\" and then just focused on giving him directions to where I was. I was hurt, and did go to the ER for a checkup right after we were finished with police reports, but I knew I wasn't hurt badly enough to be concerned and didn't want my dad to be worried while driving to me that I was in some kind of critical condition.", "Jeez, are you okay? Leave and cleave doesn't mean you completely ignore your parents/grandparents/siblings. I was 7 months pregnant with a high risk pregnancy on complete bed rest with a 3 year old when my husband had to leave 6 hours away because his brother had a serious accident. He was gone for a week. I had my mom come to help for the week. Why? Because that's his brother and I would never forgive myself if I forced him to stay home with me and his brother didn't recover. Then again, I have compassion and empathy.", "That's a selfish way of thinking. Leaving your old family behind doesn't mean you ignore emergencies or deaths, *especially* if your partner is stable.

Your mom probably gave you all the information she had and you made the best decision you could with the information you had.

Your wife has a high risk pregnancy, trauma from past losses and you left her to deal with both of those alone with a high needs child in a time crunch. \n\nYour sister was being looked after by expert medical staff *and* presumably had your mom with her. You could have gone to her after your wife's appointment.\n\nAnd okay, emotional support is important, but you can give emotional support at a distance.

If your mom isn't a trustworthy reporter and is known to catastrophise, then you really need to start taking what she says with a pinch of salt instead of falling for it every time.\n\nThat said. Your sister was apparently in a motorbike crash, and the information your mom had at the time was presumably limited. Everyone was understandably panicked, and I can't blame you for wanting to get to the hospital in case the worst happened. \n\nBut your wife was also worried for your sister, and worried for your baby, and alone with your high needs child.

But that\u2019s not the case and you\u2019ve said your wife has suffered loss before. From her perspective I can see why she doesn\u2019t feel like she\u2019s a priority on your life. I\u2019m sorry you both have suffered loss in pregnancy but clearly your last loss didn\u2019t affect you the way it does your wife because she sounds terrified of it happening again.

At this point it becomes exactly like you described there: your mother exaggerates, you run to her aid, it's not a serious matter at all, you get back, your wife is upset and now she's labelled as the one exaggerating things!

I'm guessing this kind of situation isn't the first time, and your wife is rightly fed up of it. Your sister needs a more stable person as her emergency contact in future, so that someone who is less dramatic and has a clearer head can be the one to report honestly any kind of emergencies, so that you can make decisions based on logic rather than dramatics. Whilst I agree, in an actual serious situation, that going to see your sister (if her life was in danger) would be an acceptable action... your pregnant wife and autistic child do need you, and should be your priority if your mother and sister are not in a life threatening situation.

His mom & sister have been there in OP\u2019s life & for OP\u2019s life way before his wife even knew he existed \ud83d\ude44. It\u2019s gross to expect so much and be so bothered by having to care for a difficult child while pregnant (yes, even if the pregnancy is one after you experience a loss, you\u2019re an AH to expect anyone to handle a \u201cdifficult child\u201d that\u2019s one you already had, be it before or after a loss of pregnancy. Pregnant higher risk mothers have been taking care of previous (already born) difficult children during pregnancy since\u2026.gee, idk, forever\u2026.? If it\u2019s too much trouble to handle the one that you already have without freaking out on your husband( bc he left to deal with a \u201cfamily emergency\u201d regarding his sibling that could\u2019ve been much worse than it was & he had no way of knowing). I think the wife is an AH, tbh. If it were me I\u2019d be furious with my husband for not going to make sure his sister was okay and that an apt I could potentially reschedule for even just the next day. I\u2019m sorry, the wife is totally the AH here. I say this as a mom who has had a later in pregnancy \u201cmiscarriage/loss\u201d (almost 20 weeks & water broke etc) to be able to give my opinion on that perspective-if my husband had to choose to take me to a medical apt regarding a pregnancy (yes even after having lost a pregnancy how I did) simply to keep an eye on the child I already have, not only would I feel like an AH, I\u2019d feel like an entitled AH. Again, my pregnancy after my loss I dealt with, my husband worked full time and wasn\u2019t able to handle the child we already had (one we\u2019d had before the loss) when I went to appointments bc he was at work making sure we had enough, so I dealt with being driven to appointments by my mom sometimes, and already had a 4-5 year old child that I\u2019d deal with while he was at work making sure we had money eat & feed said existing child. If his mom called and said the same thing, I\u2019d be asking my husband if he wanted me to reschedule for sometime in the next few days & I\u2019d have went with him to be there for him & his family (especially if it was made out how it was in the post, that no one really knew much how bad it was at first). I can\u2019t wrap my mind around a child\u2019s mom being so bothered by caring for the already born child because she\u2019s had a loss before and he\u2019s \u201cdifficult\u201d\u2026..kid doesn\u2019t seem exceptionally difficult, sounds like a kid to me. My thoughts at op\u2019s wife are \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to deal with the already occasionally difficult child (that doesn\u2019t seem difficult just normal for their age) that you have, WTH are you doing having a other one that may also be difficult?! Again I say this having also had a child that was somewhat difficult (5) and having a pregnancy after a loss (the loss having occurred when said child was 2) that I had to deal with while her dad was working to make sure we had enough & often wasn\u2019t able to be there for me when going to appointments. OP, you\u2019re NTAH & I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong. Seriously though, if the one child you already have is too difficult for her to deal with while pregnant, why have more?\n\n\nETA-&& I\u2019ll yell it one time louder for those that can\u2019t hear me in the back-I\u2019d also had a higher risk pregnancy bc\nOf a loss I\u2019d had at almost 20 weeks (placental abruption, actually almost died from it)& managed to deal with a sometimes difficult child when going to my appointments during the pregnancy following the loss. When dad was working full time to support his family, I didn\u2019t have a choice but to occasionally have a child that could be at times difficult at some appointments with me. It is what it is, & it\u2019s a really unfair spot the wife with the higher risk pregnancy is putting her husband in. OP, NTAH. Your wife is a little though.

There were many times I had to go to appointments alone with a 1, and 2 yo with my last pregnancy, because my husband needed to work. Yeah, it is difficult, but this was one situation. I think the combination of having to take a difficult child, the anxiety of the situation in general, and the hormones that go along with pregnancy she was understandably upset, but will be able to calm down. Have a chat once the situation chills out a bit, and I think she\u2019ll be ok.", "[removed]", "True. There are plenty of people who are too dramatic, but are not necessarily lying. They just hear accident, or see blood and lose it.", "Agreed. I think people are hearing that the mom tends to be overly dramatic and are jumping to her being deliberately manipulative, when she could just be anxious about her loved ones - and with good reason in this case.", "Exactly this and then also sit down and come up with a game plan moving forward for things like this just in case. Figure out what the plan is for your son's care so your wife isn't having to deal with the stress of that situation alone on top of everything else. She is hi risk...that means she cannot be put into even more stressful situations. pregnancy is scary enough when it's just normal.", "100%. Very thin in some cases.", "no it't not", "Demanding support yes, but it\u2018s not like that support ends with 1 missed meeting. And the wife wasn\u2019t at acute risk of death.", "I really hope you are an only child. \n\nJust because someone gets married doesn't mean the rest of the family gets less important. You marry into a family, there is a reason it's called brother and sister in law, because that is what they are, the siblings of your partner should be just as important to you as to them. \n\nThis wasn't a question between his sister was in the hospital after a motorcycle accident, and his wife is giving birth. Yes she is high risk, but she has weekly check ups, and they were fine until now. Noone is downplaying her anxiety. But pretending like a motorcycle accident isnt dangerous or you shouldn't care that much, because the sister chose to ride a bike (the wife also choice to become pregnant after her miscarriage...) Is ridiculous. And very cold hearted. \n\nI'm always wondering what kind of families people here have, where they say the partner comes above everyone now, even though they are not in immediate danger. Or that it isn't as important to be able to say goodbye to a dying sibling as it is to hold your wife's hand in a routine check up you go weekly to. Sounds like a very loving family....", "I didn't say she stopped being OP's sister or she stopped being important. She's still OP's family, she's still OP's sister. No one is saying otherwise. \n\nWhen OP got married, by definition, his \"immediate family\" became his wife (and their family together), and his family of origin became his extended family. That's what \"immediate family\" means.", "If this was his first kid, I'd understand. He can't make all the appointments. But the issue is that he was supposed to be watching their 4 year old. While she did take the kid to her appointment, it's really a terrible idea to have to take small kids to your own appointment without help.\n\nHe needed to take a minute to talk about the new logistics with his wife before leaving. That's what you do when you have small children.", "He wrote minor, also how is she ok then?", "OP said the kid screamed most of the appointment. It didn't work.They can't plan to do that again. He needs to watch his own kid when she has appointments.\n\nHe also could've taken the kid to the emergency room to see his aunt. Or called her mom to babysit. Or discussed any other option with his wife before running out and leaving her to figure it out. Which is not how you want to treat someone you're married to, or want to stay married to.", "Oh, I wouldn't be calm. I would just be freaking out from afar until it made sense for me to be there.", "Ah, I didn't read \"serious\" as \"dying\".", "Ah, I guess that's the difference. I'm the 4th person in the list for my sister after her boyfriend and my mum and dad. If I was the second person on the list I would probably feel very differently.", "I've lost three family members in my lifetime to motorcycle accidents and my siblings and I are very very close so I'd put off even my own pregnancy to rush to their side.", "All one has to do it speak to a first responder, ER personnel, nurses, etc., to realize how dire that can be.", "If my mom said her arm hurt, I would be concerned because we, her children, would have to be the ones to take her to the hospital. She has no one else and doesn\u2019t drive (trauma from a car accident and no car). There\u2019s a lot of reasons why a parent would rely on their children.", "If my mother fell, I would be there. Even if it's to check all is good with my own eyes, or to take her to hospital to make sure.\n\nI wouldn't care how many times she told me that she was fine, I would still make a doc seecheck on her.\n\nAnd if I had another emergency, I would arrange it with a friend and rush there asap.", "She's on oxygen and disabled, she can barely walk. So she complains a lot. But no she can't take herself. She's not allowed to drive and needs a walker most places she goes. But yeah thanks for assume she's healthy! Not like lots of people in the world have circumstances that may force them to need someone to help them get around eh?", "Nope, with the wife he actually manages their kid, he has very practical job to do.", "High risk 100% means in danger. At any moment a placenta could rupture, mom could bleed out from a sudden movement, baby's heart could suddenly stop beating, etc.", "\"manipulative pathological liar,\" were YOUR words, not mine, as I specified. From the information provided, OP's mother is not trustworthy, for all her good intentions. A person doesn't need to be \"a manipulative pathological liar,\" not to be trustworthy. Those were just the words *you* chose.\n\nHigh risk pregnancy means the baby is ALWAYS in imminent danger, and that the mother is in nontrivial danger as well. This was probably the only week that the sister will be in more danger than the baby, but there was never anything OP was going to be able to do for her.", "Pregnancy van actually make you an invalid, have you heard of preeclampsia and prescribed bedrest? That's what this woman has to look forward to, because the stress of doing everything alone while her husband rushes off to tend scraped knees will kill her.", "Amazing idea", "By random, I meant that there was no prior signs that there would be troubles at this appointment more than the one before or the one after. I understand that under normal circumstances it would be definitely something to attend but comparatively it was significantly less risk of anything going wrong than with his sister in the hospital.\n\nAnd it's not about more or less sad but rather that if he skips on sister and she passes away then he can NEVER have those last moments. He can't do ANYTHING. If he is 4 hours late to console his wife, obviously that is not great either, but at least he can still console her. If his sister passed away then there is no alternative, no making it up, the chance is gone forever. In that sense, the issue with his sister was more pressing.\n\nI agree that the way he phrased it is wrong and preferably he should apologize for that but also I cannot really judge him for a poor response given the circumstances. His wife's berating of him were unjust and the shock of his sister maybe dying probably still lingering. I think it's fairly understandable why he might snap.", "Also have to chime in and add to the wonderful comments I\u2019ve posted  regarding my situation that was similar-(the high risk pregnancy/taking care of my own child)-between my lost pregnancy and my high risk pregnancy, I\u2019d actually dealt with a severe traumatic brain injury, which required a craniectomy.  Two terribly awful traumatic situations within a year\u2019s time. Lost my pregnancy April 23 2005, had the car accident that caused the severe tbi on March 11,2006. I can get both sides of this debate here (in a very literal sense)& I agree that OP is definitely NTAH.", "First time in a while I caught a rewording bot.\n\nBad bot!

You cannot take head injuries too seriously.", "Bob Saget.", "My husband\u2019s grandfather died from a brain bleed. He seemed fine for a day in the hospital, until the next day when he wouldn\u2019t wake up. The brain is nothing to mess around with.", "I had a friend die due to a concussion sustained during a motor vehicle accident that wasn't caught in time.  It takes time after an accident to really determine the extent of the damage to a person. The people trying to downplay the severity of this accident are really operating from a 'hind site is 20/20' perspective.", "yes it'ttt ittt;t is", "Actually, it is.", "Yes it is", "People downplay the seriousness of a concussion. \n\nConcussions are extremely serious injuries that can have life long consequences, or even lead to death.", "Did you miss the \u201cemergency\u201d part of all of this? No one \u201cplanned\u201d for mom to take the kid to the appointment alone. Emergencies are the farthest thing from convenient. \n\nAnd no, he likely couldn\u2019t. I haven\u2019t been to an emergency room that allows children that aren\u2019t the patient. Not to mention, if he thinks his sister is dying, the much more correct place for the kid is moms appointment. I certainly don\u2019t want to take my preschooler to literally watch someone die, and if my husband decided to do so, I wouldn\u2019t be happy with him.", "Right, but if he's at the GYN appt physically, but not mentally, he's in just as much trouble, if not more.", "That's the opposite of what they said:\n\n> Can\u2019t be surprised that people want to drop everything\n\nIn other words, obviously they want to drop everything since they know a motorbike accident is often life threatening.", "Read it again", "I hope you mean do go, because that's what the person you're replying to was saying.", "While his sister was possibly dying? What the fuck?", "Genuinely not sure how/where you\u2019re missing the point so let me rephrase\u2026This was a preventative doctor\u2019s check up. It was not a corrective appointment in response to a medical emergency. \n\nOP\u2019s sister\u2019s appointment was not an appointment at all, rather a response to a medical emergency, i.e a corrective rather than preventive measure. \n\nThe difference is in one situation a medical emergency has happened, in the other one it has not. Big ole difference.", "Did anyone mention pre-eclampsia or bed rest though? No.\n\nThis is clearly a one off incident where he was told there was a serious accident and reacted appropriately (sure it turns out it wasn't, but how was he to know that?) he clearly stated that he books time off work to attend normally.", "Utterly ridiculous comment. She isn\u2019t doing everything alone. It was a potential life and death situation. Sounds like he attends every other appointment. If anything, the husband should be querying why his wife is so cold and unfeeling. Didn\u2019t even ask about sister\u2019s well-being.", "True, but at the same time a concussion is still serious. It\u2019s not something to be taken lightly. If my child had sustained a concussion after a motorcycle accident as well as other injuries, and was being treated at the hospital I would also be calling my whole family. It was a very unfortunate time for OP and for his wife, but just because something isn\u2019t \u2018life threatening\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not very distressing. I\u2019m sticking firm with NAH. Hopefully with a full explanation OPs wife will understand his mother was always going to be worried about her child, just like his wife is very anxious and worried about their child now. It\u2019s a very difficult situation and I can empathise with every person really..", "Actually popped in here to say this exact thing.", "When you have small children you can't just rush right out, even in an emergency. He needed to talk to his wife about how to handle it, not just rush out and leave her to figure it out.", "What could OP have done for his sister that a doctor couldn't? Nada. What could OP have done for his wife had she gotten bad news. Literally everything she needed.  His mom is the  biggest AH here. The injuries she has do not sound like a serious crash. Sounds exactly like what he said which was that his mother is dramatic. Knowing that he could have made better decisions. Op and his mom both owe his wife an apology. His mom for freaking out over what sounds like a very minor accident. Him for falling for his mother's historical histrionics, failing to be there for his wife when she may have actually needed him and telling her \"but it wasn't serious\" when she said it could have been. That's so many people's arguments is his sister COULD have been more serious. Well so could the issue with his wife. Imagine getting to an appointment that you're already stressed about and they find out during the ultrasound that there isn't a heartbeat....again. So now you're dealing with your second miscarriage, a screaming 4 year old and the fact that your husband bailed for his overly dramatic mother. I had my second kid last year and was also high risk as I'm a bit older, have heart issues and have miscarried. I cried tears if relief every single ultrasound that i saw my girls heartbeat.", "Thanks", "He said he knows his mom to be over dramatic. \n\nI don\u2019t think OP could win in this situation though, tbh. If his sister was in critical condition of course he\u2019d want to be there. I think the wife probably would\u2019ve been ok at the appointment alone if she also didn\u2019t have her autistic son throwing a tantrum through the whole thing. \n\nI was commenting though that the sister wasn\u2019t alone, she had her mom. He would just be emotional support there. But he would be physical support for his wife at her appointment to help deal with their son.", "What if there was a decision that needed to be taken ? That's his sister we're talking about not a random person and maybe it's cultural but my sister being in a life threatening situation is more important than my partner being in really uncomfortable situation.", "Again, even if his mother was known for being dramatic, what if his sister had died?\n\nSure, her mom would have been there, but do you think OP could forgive himself for not being there too?\n\n\nIf your family had an emergency where someone could be dead (you don't know,) what would you do to go straight there? \n\nIf you don't think it's important, why not?", "The situation was not life threatening.  And the family he created should be priority. I love my baby sister so much but everyone should know my daughters come first. You can call it uncomfortable if you want but it's so much more. I hope you haven't experienced losing a child and the anxiety of it yourself and I sincerely hope you never have to. I assume you haven't because of the way you talk about it.  It isn't uncomfortable. It's extraordinarily painful and the anxiety it gives you in subsequent pregnancies is also painful.", "I think I made it pretty clear where I stand. I\u2019m not disagreeing with you?", "Based on the information he received it was life threatening and as painful as his wife's situation was, she wasn't in immediate danger situation. That's what it comes to in those cases. There is no bad decision to come here and say he is AH for worrying for his sister."]}
