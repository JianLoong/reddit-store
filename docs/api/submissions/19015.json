I tell my wife, and she\u2019s furious bc I missed the appointment and she ended up being late because our son wasn\u2019t cooperating and how he screamed most the appointment.

If you hear \u201cmotorcycle crash\u201d and \u201cserious,\u201d the appropriate response isn\u2019t, \u201cEh, I\u2019m sure my sister\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\nSomething needs to be done about your mother\u2019s overdramatic tendencies, tho.", "NAH.\n\nA pretty tough situation to be in. But, you aren't a doctor so not sure why you were required to be there immediately?\n\nMom was stupidly dramatic, you should've clarified the situation.\n\nEdit: guys I posted this before any mention of an accident", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry it\u2019s in this situation that no matter what you did, you were going to upset someone. Your mum is TA for being overly dramatic and your wife should not make you choose between your sister and her, that\u2019s unfair. \n\nI would wait till she calms down slightly and have a gentle conversation about this, acknowledge her anxiety and how you want to be there - and you are. This may be like this though throughout the whole pregnancy\u2026.", "NTA. i get her anxiety is really bad, but you thought there was an emergency with a family member. that is excusable", "Nah.\n\nIt could have gone both ways. Now you know that your sister was not seriously injured but at the time you did not and chose accordingly. \n\nIt sucks that you missed the appointment but apparently nothing too mlbad happened. But your wife is  high risk pregnant and I can not imagine the anxiety she's going through. And anxiety sometimes manifests itself in lashing out to the person near you.", "NTA as far as you know your sister could have been dying, your wife's ire should be on your mother's shoulders not yours.", "It doesn't sound like pregnancy hormones. She is suffering from complications and was left with a hard to manage child with autism. How long was her appointment, and could you have done both? Did you even consider your child, too? I understand going to the hospital and even keeping tabs on your sister during your wife's appointment. The fact that you completely disregarded your immediate family might be why she's pissed.", "This is a tough one. If your wife has anxiety about the pregnancy, you really need to prioritize being there for her and helping ease her anxiety. I completely understand your decision making with the info you had, just be careful moving forward. Sincerely apologize and promise to put her first and be there for her.\n\nUltimately going to say NAH\u2026\n\nBe careful, my wife had a lot of resentment and years of working through this for a somewhat similar situation. She completely felt abandoned and lost trust in me. Fair or not, it can really strain a relationship. Try to imagine the fear and anxiety she is feeling. She needs you.", "NTA, you didn't know the injury wasn't serious. I understand that your wife is having a stressful time, but she seems completely self centered and unresponsive to reason. You did not miss the appointment on purpose. If your sister was seriously injured, it makes complete sense for you to visit her. Hopefully, you work things out with your wife if this is an unexpected response on her part.", "I'm going with NTA.  Had I gotten a call like that, my wife, with her in the OB GYN's office, she'd have told me to go.  And with what you'd been given I think you should have.", "Info : if you know your mom has tends to be overdramatic, did it cross your mind to try find out from someone else what condition your sister was really in?\n\nI'm going to lean towards NAH though, with maybe the exception of your mom who mislead you with her dramatics.", "NTA - That said, apologize to your wife. She's dealing with a lot and needs your support...hormones are massively high, now is not the time to not be there. I understand wanting to be there for a serious accident for a family member, but unless they are going into the icu, I would suggest keeping your wife, new baby, and child as first priority. As someone else pointed out, there's nothing you could've done for your sister except sit in a waiting room with your mother, meanwhile you could be very helpful to your wife. I may get downvoted and others may disagree, but that's my 2 cents", "YTA if you don't immediately take major steps to get out from your mother's thumb. This should be a huge wake-up call that you need STRONG boundaries with your mother. It sounds like this was not the first time she has lied to get you to prioritize her, and it won't be the last. \n\nFrom now on, you don't get to believe anything your mother says if it would at all be of detriment to your wife. You don't drop everything without confirmation from a TRUSTED source that whatever crisis she has concocted is real. She says someone's dying? Get confirmation from a second source. Your mother is not a trustworthy person, and you know it, so don't torpedo your marriage for her.\n\nETA: Whatever was happening with your sister, she wasn't completely alone, your mother was there. Your wife, on the other hand, was left completely alone. YOUR wife. YOUR partner.", "NAH. If she acts like this outside of pregnancies, then you'd have a problem. But this seems pretty understandable that you had no good choices to make in that situation.", "This is a tough situation it\u2019s like a mixture of an ah and no ah. You knew your mom is over dramatic but she did say a motorcycle accident and that sounds scary you reacted out of fear. However telling your wife well you didn\u2019t find out anything was wrong isn\u2019t the right thing to say especially when she is upset. Your wife was alone with a crying child on top of pregnancy she wanted your support.", "This is a tough one. However in this case I'm going to say YTA. You know your mom is prone to be dramatic and over exaggerate things. Sounds like your mom might have some narcisistic tendencies. Depends on weather or not when she exaggerates these things she ends up drawing the attention onto herself of look at poor me.... Saying this because my grandmother was just like that. \n\nYou also know how high risk the pregnancy of your wife is. The least you could have done is take your son with you, so she could at least have a peaceful appointment alone or find a last minute sitter. Last thing she needs is more stress with an already high risk pregnancy. This is the life of your unborn child you're putting in more risk than it needs to be by stressing your wife out like all hell.", "YTA. Your sister was not alone, but your wife was, with a high-risk pregnancy and a high-needs kid. You left your wife high and dry at the beck and call of your mother, who is 'known to be dramatic', to rush to your sister's side in the hospital without even knowing what was going on, and you're trying to frame your wife being upset about this as *her* being dramatic.\n\nIt's not hormones. Recalibrate your priorities, dude.", "Let me get this straight, you prioritized you sister over your pregnant wife?\n\nNow you wondering why your wife is angry with you? Gee, I wonder why..\n\nYTA", "NAH, except for your Mother. Honestly, if I heard \u201csister\u201d, \u201cmotorcycle crash\u201d and \u201cserious\u201d I\u2019d have done exactly what you did; my rational brain wouldn\u2019t have been able to kick in to ask \u201chmm can I trust that this isn\u2019t as serious?\u201d. You made a very difficult judgement call and unfortunately, it was the wrong one but I don\u2019t believe the call was in bad faith. Your wife is talking about hypotheticals on her side with the baby, but there are those for you too; what if it had been serious and it was your last chance to see your sister?\nThat being said, I think you owe your wife an apology for adding to her stress, not considering your family when you made the decision to drive 40+ mins away and not taking a second to assess the validity of your mother\u2019s claims. \nI\u2019d also be interested to know whether this has happened before? Does your mother have a habit of dragging you away from your family for \u201cemergencies\u201d; your wife\u2019s reaction was intense, and aside from pregnancy hormones/anxiety, I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s also a precedent of things like this happening before?\nA final note; you should also look at contingency planning for appointments in the future; do you have friends or loved ones nearby who could watch your son? Is there someone else your wife would trust to be at an appointment with her if you can\u2019t make it? I wonder if having these measures in place would help reduce your wife\u2019s anxiety and make her feel less reliant on your decisions. I imagine a lot of her anger is coming from feeling helpless/dependent and it\u2019s going to take time and effort from you to rebuild her trust.\nWishing you and your wife all the luck for the pregnancy and birth.", "Yes. YTA. Your pregnant wife and son needed you. You could have gone to the appointment and then gone to visit your sister. Or at least touched base with your mom (who you\u2019ve acknowledged is overly dramatic) to get an update.\n\nThe fact that you doubled down on your choice instead of trying to understand your wife\u2019s anxiety and simply apologized and committed to being there for her is ridiculous.", "[deleted]", "NTA. It feels like a tough situation to be in. \n\nThis hits a little too close to home to our family as we lost my BiL 8 years ago (today\u2019s date) in a motorcycle accident. Hope you work things out with your wife.", "YTA. Your wife is in a high risk pregnancy, she and your unborn child need to be a priority.", "NTA.  You were in a no-win situation.  You weren't obligated to go to either hospital, but you were expected to by various women.  You couldn't cut yourself in half to go to both hospitals.  So you were definitely going to piss off somebody.\n\nI think your wife needs to cut you some slack.  With what you knew before you left home, you made the difficult but logical and correct choice.", "NTA - An impossible choice to make. I would have taken dieing family member over routine appointments. Ignore her for a few hours, she will soon stop nagging", "NTA.

Yeah I was anxious (I spend the year running on auto drive, because life does go on), but I didn't take it out on my husband and child. My husband had to miss most of my appointments, so I made arrangements for the toddler to go to daycare or have the grandparents watch her. I got admitted to the hospital 3 times, for a total of 22 days. It sucked. It was awful, but none of it was his fault. \nTo top it all of my waters broke a week before my scheduled c-section and I went to the hospital thinking it was just another bleeding, expecting to bed home at the end of the day again. So my husband dropped me off and went to work. When all my blood clots had been flushed out and I suddenly started losing clear fluid is when everyone started panicking. A normal delivery was impossible die to my complications, so I had to get an emergency c-section. I called my husband and the idiot had turned off his cell phone. So I called his school and made the genator get him from his classroom. I totally panicked when I could not get a good of my husband though. That the receptionist could even understand me through my tears is amazing. I don't hold a grudge against my husband for turning off the sound from his phone though. He was also expecting the bleeding to stop again and for me to be sent home. At some point you get so used to the medical emergency status that you stop functioning like it's a medical emergency and you just go on with your life as normal.\nI'm going to get therapy to work through my trauma and in the mean time I'm doing the best I can to not take it out on others. It's my anxiety and my trauma to deal with. \nI understand that your wife has anxiety and this whole pregnancy is traumatic for her. Life does however continue to happen and when a real emergency happens you are allowed to respond to it.

You were told she was in a major accident. While your wife is high risk, it was a routine weekly appointment. I\u2019d be pissed if my husband heard a family member was in the hospital and chose to go to a routine appointment with me instead. It sucks but shit happens. I\u2019m glad your sister is okay and your wife\u2019s appointment seemed to have gone well. I think everyone is heavily focused on the idea that you know your mom is dramatic but there\u2019s honestly no way to tell. imagine if you brushed it off as your mom being dramatic and your sister was actually in life threatening condition? then you\u2019d be the AH for not being by her side. it\u2019s kind of a lose lose situation.

Also the challenge associated with your son during these times.  However its a regular appointment and while you have been there for all the others it should be ok to miss one if its for something serious.\n\nAs you said your sister was in a motorbike accident.

You are definitely not an asshole. You sound like someone who is very conscientious about helping those around you. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to choose among competing needs and you made a reasonable choice given the info you had.\n\nOn the other hand, after my twins were born, it would often be overwhelming to take care of them in certain situations. If I was counting on help from my husband and he wasn\u2019t able to, I would get very upset at him. (Usually it wasn\u2019t for as good a reason as you had). I think it\u2019s important that you had to acknowledge the struggles she is having getting to appointments in time with your son and also the anxiety that previous losses have caused her. Maybe turn the focus into mutually addressing those valid difficulties shes having. As this situation has shown, her relying on you and only you to help with these issues doesn\u2019t work 100% of the time so you may need to build a more resilient support network or get other kinds of help.", "NAH, but there are multiple problems here that you shouldn't let fester.\n\nYour mom will say whatever is necessary to get the reaction she wants. If your sister only had a concussions and dislocatd knee, than there was no mistaking that situation for a \"serious motorcycle accident.\" (On that note, your sister should stop riding a motorcycle since otherwise she'll probably be back in the hospital in the next year.) In this case, your mom misrepresented the facts because she wanted YOU to freak out with her. Not permanently, but for a couple of months while you get this situation sorted out, I would consider blocking your mom's phone number.
