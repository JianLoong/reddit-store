If you hear \u201cmotorcycle crash\u201d and \u201cserious,\u201d the appropriate response isn\u2019t, \u201cEh, I\u2019m sure my sister\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\nSomething needs to be done about your mother\u2019s overdramatic tendencies, tho.", "NAH.\n\nA pretty tough situation to be in. But, you aren't a doctor so not sure why you were required to be there immediately?\n\nMom was stupidly dramatic, you should've clarified the situation.\n\nEdit: guys I posted this before any mention of an accident", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry it\u2019s in this situation that no matter what you did, you were going to upset someone. Your mum is TA for being overly dramatic and your wife should not make you choose between your sister and her, that\u2019s unfair. \n\nI would wait till she calms down slightly and have a gentle conversation about this, acknowledge her anxiety and how you want to be there - and you are. This may be like this though throughout the whole pregnancy\u2026.", "NTA. i get her anxiety is really bad, but you thought there was an emergency with a family member. that is excusable", "Nah.\n\nIt could have gone both ways. Now you know that your sister was not seriously injured but at the time you did not and chose accordingly. \n\nIt sucks that you missed the appointment but apparently nothing too mlbad happened. But your wife is  high risk pregnant and I can not imagine the anxiety she's going through. And anxiety sometimes manifests itself in lashing out to the person near you.", "NTA as far as you know your sister could have been dying, your wife's ire should be on your mother's shoulders not yours.", "It doesn't sound like pregnancy hormones. She is suffering from complications and was left with a hard to manage child with autism. How long was her appointment, and could you have done both? Did you even consider your child, too? I understand going to the hospital and even keeping tabs on your sister during your wife's appointment. The fact that you completely disregarded your immediate family might be why she's pissed.", "This is a tough one. If your wife has anxiety about the pregnancy, you really need to prioritize being there for her and helping ease her anxiety. I completely understand your decision making with the info you had, just be careful moving forward. Sincerely apologize and promise to put her first and be there for her.\n\nUltimately going to say NAH\u2026\n\nBe careful, my wife had a lot of resentment and years of working through this for a somewhat similar situation. She completely felt abandoned and lost trust in me. Fair or not, it can really strain a relationship. Try to imagine the fear and anxiety she is feeling. She needs you.", "NTA, you didn't know the injury wasn't serious. I understand that your wife is having a stressful time, but she seems completely self centered and unresponsive to reason. You did not miss the appointment on purpose. If your sister was seriously injured, it makes complete sense for you to visit her. Hopefully, you work things out with your wife if this is an unexpected response on her part.", "I'm going with NTA.  Had I gotten a call like that, my wife, with her in the OB GYN's office, she'd have told me to go.  And with what you'd been given I think you should have.", "Info : if you know your mom has tends to be overdramatic, did it cross your mind to try find out from someone else what condition your sister was really in?\n\nI'm going to lean towards NAH though, with maybe the exception of your mom who mislead you with her dramatics.", "NTA - That said, apologize to your wife. She's dealing with a lot and needs your support...hormones are massively high, now is not the time to not be there. I understand wanting to be there for a serious accident for a family member, but unless they are going into the icu, I would suggest keeping your wife, new baby, and child as first priority. As someone else pointed out, there's nothing you could've done for your sister except sit in a waiting room with your mother, meanwhile you could be very helpful to your wife. I may get downvoted and others may disagree, but that's my 2 cents", "YTA if you don't immediately take major steps to get out from your mother's thumb. This should be a huge wake-up call that you need STRONG boundaries with your mother. It sounds like this was not the first time she has lied to get you to prioritize her, and it won't be the last. \n\nFrom now on, you don't get to believe anything your mother says if it would at all be of detriment to your wife. You don't drop everything without confirmation from a TRUSTED source that whatever crisis she has concocted is real. She says someone's dying? Get confirmation from a second source. Your mother is not a trustworthy person, and you know it, so don't torpedo your marriage for her.\n\nETA: Whatever was happening with your sister, she wasn't completely alone, your mother was there. Your wife, on the other hand, was left completely alone. YOUR wife. YOUR partner.", "NAH. If she acts like this outside of pregnancies, then you'd have a problem. But this seems pretty understandable that you had no good choices to make in that situation.", "This is a tough situation it\u2019s like a mixture of an ah and no ah. You knew your mom is over dramatic but she did say a motorcycle accident and that sounds scary you reacted out of fear. However telling your wife well you didn\u2019t find out anything was wrong isn\u2019t the right thing to say especially when she is upset. Your wife was alone with a crying child on top of pregnancy she wanted your support.", "This is a tough one. However in this case I'm going to say YTA. You know your mom is prone to be dramatic and over exaggerate things. Sounds like your mom might have some narcisistic tendencies. Depends on weather or not when she exaggerates these things she ends up drawing the attention onto herself of look at poor me.... Saying this because my grandmother was just like that. \n\nYou also know how high risk the pregnancy of your wife is. The least you could have done is take your son with you, so she could at least have a peaceful appointment alone or find a last minute sitter. Last thing she needs is more stress with an already high risk pregnancy. This is the life of your unborn child you're putting in more risk than it needs to be by stressing your wife out like all hell.", "YTA. Your sister was not alone, but your wife was, with a high-risk pregnancy and a high-needs kid. You left your wife high and dry at the beck and call of your mother, who is 'known to be dramatic', to rush to your sister's side in the hospital without even knowing what was going on, and you're trying to frame your wife being upset about this as *her* being dramatic.\n\nIt's not hormones. Recalibrate your priorities, dude.", "Let me get this straight, you prioritized you sister over your pregnant wife?\n\nNow you wondering why your wife is angry with you? Gee, I wonder why..\n\nYTA", "NAH, except for your Mother. Honestly, if I heard \u201csister\u201d, \u201cmotorcycle crash\u201d and \u201cserious\u201d I\u2019d have done exactly what you did; my rational brain wouldn\u2019t have been able to kick in to ask \u201chmm can I trust that this isn\u2019t as serious?\u201d. You made a very difficult judgement call and unfortunately, it was the wrong one but I don\u2019t believe the call was in bad faith. Your wife is talking about hypotheticals on her side with the baby, but there are those for you too; what if it had been serious and it was your last chance to see your sister?\nThat being said, I think you owe your wife an apology for adding to her stress, not considering your family when you made the decision to drive 40+ mins away and not taking a second to assess the validity of your mother\u2019s claims. \nI\u2019d also be interested to know whether this has happened before? Does your mother have a habit of dragging you away from your family for \u201cemergencies\u201d; your wife\u2019s reaction was intense, and aside from pregnancy hormones/anxiety, I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s also a precedent of things like this happening before?\nA final note; you should also look at contingency planning for appointments in the future; do you have friends or loved ones nearby who could watch your son? Is there someone else your wife would trust to be at an appointment with her if you can\u2019t make it? I wonder if having these measures in place would help reduce your wife\u2019s anxiety and make her feel less reliant on your decisions. I imagine a lot of her anger is coming from feeling helpless/dependent and it\u2019s going to take time and effort from you to rebuild her trust.\nWishing you and your wife all the luck for the pregnancy and birth.", "Yes. YTA. Your pregnant wife and son needed you. You could have gone to the appointment and then gone to visit your sister. Or at least touched base with your mom (who you\u2019ve acknowledged is overly dramatic) to get an update.\n\nThe fact that you doubled down on your choice instead of trying to understand your wife\u2019s anxiety and simply apologized and committed to being there for her is ridiculous.", "[deleted]", "NTA. It feels like a tough situation to be in. \n\nThis hits a little too close to home to our family as we lost my BiL 8 years ago (today\u2019s date) in a motorcycle accident. Hope you work things out with your wife.", "YTA. Your wife is in a high risk pregnancy, she and your unborn child need to be a priority.", "NTA.  You were in a no-win situation.  You weren't obligated to go to either hospital, but you were expected to by various women.  You couldn't cut yourself in half to go to both hospitals.  So you were definitely going to piss off somebody.\n\nI think your wife needs to cut you some slack.  With what you knew before you left home, you made the difficult but logical and correct choice.", "NTA - An impossible choice to make. I would have taken dieing family member over routine appointments. Ignore her for a few hours, she will soon stop nagging", "NTA.

Yeah I was anxious (I spend the year running on auto drive, because life does go on), but I didn't take it out on my husband and child. My husband had to miss most of my appointments, so I made arrangements for the toddler to go to daycare or have the grandparents watch her. I got admitted to the hospital 3 times, for a total of 22 days. It sucked. It was awful, but none of it was his fault. \nTo top it all of my waters broke a week before my scheduled c-section and I went to the hospital thinking it was just another bleeding, expecting to bed home at the end of the day again. So my husband dropped me off and went to work. When all my blood clots had been flushed out and I suddenly started losing clear fluid is when everyone started panicking. A normal delivery was impossible die to my complications, so I had to get an emergency c-section. I called my husband and the idiot had turned off his cell phone. So I called his school and made the genator get him from his classroom. I totally panicked when I could not get a good of my husband though. That the receptionist could even understand me through my tears is amazing. I don't hold a grudge against my husband for turning off the sound from his phone though. He was also expecting the bleeding to stop again and for me to be sent home. At some point you get so used to the medical emergency status that you stop functioning like it's a medical emergency and you just go on with your life as normal.\nI'm going to get therapy to work through my trauma and in the mean time I'm doing the best I can to not take it out on others. It's my anxiety and my trauma to deal with. \nI understand that your wife has anxiety and this whole pregnancy is traumatic for her. Life does however continue to happen and when a real emergency happens you are allowed to respond to it.

You were told she was in a major accident. While your wife is high risk, it was a routine weekly appointment. I\u2019d be pissed if my husband heard a family member was in the hospital and chose to go to a routine appointment with me instead. It sucks but shit happens. I\u2019m glad your sister is okay and your wife\u2019s appointment seemed to have gone well. I think everyone is heavily focused on the idea that you know your mom is dramatic but there\u2019s honestly no way to tell. imagine if you brushed it off as your mom being dramatic and your sister was actually in life threatening condition? then you\u2019d be the AH for not being by her side. it\u2019s kind of a lose lose situation.

Also the challenge associated with your son during these times.  However its a regular appointment and while you have been there for all the others it should be ok to miss one if its for something serious.\n\nAs you said your sister was in a motorbike accident.

You are definitely not an asshole. You sound like someone who is very conscientious about helping those around you. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to choose among competing needs and you made a reasonable choice given the info you had.\n\nOn the other hand, after my twins were born, it would often be overwhelming to take care of them in certain situations. If I was counting on help from my husband and he wasn\u2019t able to, I would get very upset at him. (Usually it wasn\u2019t for as good a reason as you had). I think it\u2019s important that you  acknowledge the struggles she is having getting to appointments in time with your son and also the anxiety that previous losses have caused her. Maybe turn the focus into mutually addressing those valid difficulties shes having. As this situation has shown, her relying on you and only you to help with these issues doesn\u2019t work 100% of the time so you may need to build a more resilient support network or get other kinds of help.", "NAH, but there are multiple problems here that you shouldn't let fester.\n\nYour mom will say whatever is necessary to get the reaction she wants. If your sister only had a concussions and dislocatd knee, than there was no mistaking that situation for a \"serious motorcycle accident.\" (On that note, your sister should stop riding a motorcycle since otherwise she'll probably be back in the hospital in the next year.) In this case, your mom misrepresented the facts because she wanted YOU to freak out with her. Not permanently, but for a couple of months while you get this situation sorted out, I would consider blocking your mom's phone number.

When I was in an accident last year where I got rear ended and my car totaled I called my dad almost right away at the scene. The first thing I said was \"I'm okay, but I was just in an accident\" and then just focused on giving him directions to where I was. I was hurt, and did go to the ER for a checkup right after we were finished with police reports, but I knew I wasn't hurt badly enough to be concerned and didn't want my dad to be worried while driving to me that I was in some kind of critical condition.", "Jeez, are you okay? Leave and cleave doesn't mean you completely ignore your parents/grandparents/siblings. I was 7 months pregnant with a high risk pregnancy on complete bed rest with a 3 year old when my husband had to leave 6 hours away because his brother had a serious accident. He was gone for a week. I had my mom come to help for the week. Why? Because that's his brother and I would never forgive myself if I forced him to stay home with me and his brother didn't recover. Then again, I have compassion and empathy.", "That's a selfish way of thinking. Leaving your old family behind doesn't mean you ignore emergencies or deaths, *especially* if your partner is stable.

Your mom probably gave you all the information she had and you made the best decision you could with the information you had.

Your wife has a high risk pregnancy, trauma from past losses and you left her to deal with both of those alone with a high needs child in a time crunch. \n\nYour sister was being looked after by expert medical staff *and* presumably had your mom with her. You could have gone to her after your wife's appointment.\n\nAnd okay, emotional support is important, but you can give emotional support at a distance.

If your mom isn't a trustworthy reporter and is known to catastrophise, then you really need to start taking what she says with a pinch of salt instead of falling for it every time.\n\nThat said. Your sister was apparently in a motorbike crash, and the information your mom had at the time was presumably limited. Everyone was understandably panicked, and I can't blame you for wanting to get to the hospital in case the worst happened. \n\nBut your wife was also worried for your sister, and worried for your baby, and alone with your high needs child.

But that\u2019s not the case and you\u2019ve said your wife has suffered loss before. From her perspective I can see why she doesn\u2019t feel like she\u2019s a priority on your life. I\u2019m sorry you both have suffered loss in pregnancy but clearly your last loss didn\u2019t affect you the way it does your wife because she sounds terrified of it happening again.

At this point it becomes exactly like you described there: your mother exaggerates, you run to her aid, it's not a serious matter at all, you get back, your wife is upset and now she's labelled as the one exaggerating things!

I'm guessing this kind of situation isn't the first time, and your wife is rightly fed up of it. Your sister needs a more stable person as her emergency contact in future, so that someone who is less dramatic and has a clearer head can be the one to report honestly any kind of emergencies, so that you can make decisions based on logic rather than dramatics. Whilst I agree, in an actual serious situation, that going to see your sister (if her life was in danger) would be an acceptable action... your pregnant wife and autistic child do need you, and should be your priority if your mother and sister are not in a life threatening situation.

His mom & sister have been there in OP\u2019s life & for OP\u2019s life way before his wife even knew he existed \ud83d\ude44. It\u2019s gross to expect so much and be so bothered by having to care for a difficult child while pregnant (yes, even if the pregnancy is one after you experience a loss, you\u2019re an AH to expect anyone to handle a \u201cdifficult child\u201d that\u2019s one you already had, be it before or after a loss of pregnancy. Pregnant higher risk mothers have been taking care of previous (already born) difficult children during pregnancy since\u2026.gee, idk, forever\u2026.? If it\u2019s too much trouble to handle the one that you already have without freaking out on your husband( bc he left to deal with a \u201cfamily emergency\u201d regarding his sibling that could\u2019ve been much worse than it was & he had no way of knowing). I think the wife is an AH, tbh. If it were me I\u2019d be furious with my husband for not going to make sure his sister was okay and that an apt I could potentially reschedule for even just the next day. I\u2019m sorry, the wife is totally the AH here. I say this as a mom who has had a later in pregnancy \u201cmiscarriage/loss\u201d (almost 20 weeks & water broke etc) to be able to give my opinion on that perspective-if my husband had to choose to take me to a medical apt regarding a pregnancy (yes even after having lost a pregnancy how I did) simply to keep an eye on the child I already have, not only would I feel like an AH, I\u2019d feel like an entitled AH. Again, my pregnancy after my loss I dealt with, my husband worked full time and wasn\u2019t able to handle the child we already had (one we\u2019d had before the loss) when I went to appointments bc he was at work making sure we had enough, so I dealt with being driven to appointments by my mom sometimes, and already had a 4-5 year old child that I\u2019d deal with while he was at work making sure we had money eat & feed said existing child. If his mom called and said the same thing, I\u2019d be asking my husband if he wanted me to reschedule for sometime in the next few days & I\u2019d have went with him to be there for him & his family (especially if it was made out how it was in the post, that no one really knew much how bad it was at first). I can\u2019t wrap my mind around a child\u2019s mom being so bothered by caring for the already born child because she\u2019s had a loss before and he\u2019s \u201cdifficult\u201d\u2026..kid doesn\u2019t seem exceptionally difficult, sounds like a kid to me. My thoughts at op\u2019s wife are \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to deal with the already occasionally difficult child (that doesn\u2019t seem difficult just normal for their age) that you have, WTH are you doing having a other one that may also be difficult?! Again I say this having also had a child that was somewhat difficult (5) and having a pregnancy after a loss (the loss having occurred when said child was 2) that I had to deal with while her dad was working to make sure we had enough & often wasn\u2019t able to be there for me when going to appointments. OP, you\u2019re NTAH & I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong. Seriously though, if the one child you already have is too difficult for her to deal with while pregnant, why have more?\n\n\nETA-&& I\u2019ll yell it one time louder for those that can\u2019t hear me in the back-I\u2019d also had a higher risk pregnancy bc\nOf a loss I\u2019d had at almost 20 weeks (placental abruption, actually almost died from it)& managed to deal with a sometimes difficult child when going to my appointments during the pregnancy following the loss. When dad was working full time to support his family, I didn\u2019t have a choice but to occasionally have a child that could be at times difficult at some appointments with me. It is what it is, & it\u2019s a really unfair spot the wife with the higher risk pregnancy is putting her husband in. OP, NTAH. Your wife is a little though.

It was pretty bad; multiple broken bones, partially collapsed left lung, etc..

There was no Dr. House at the scene to give me a once over and make a snarky comment about anyone overreacting. \n\n\nMy phone was smashed in the crash. I was able to give the police officers at the scene contact info for my parents and then gf (all living in another state about 4 hours away); they called and ALL that they were permitted to say is, \"He was in a motorcycle accident and ejected from the vehicle (duh) and is being taken to the hospital.\" Fortunately, I had a company phone in a bag that survived; but it was probably 2 hours of travel to the hospital and intake scans before I was able to get my hands on it and call people to let them know I wasn't dying.\u00a0 \n\n\nSo take that into consideration in calling the mom or OP an AH.

It is impossible to tell the severity until then. \n\nI spent 3 hours in a small ER hospital after a crash in the mountains. They did cat scans and X-rays to rule out internal bleeding and noticed I had multiple fractures. But didn\u2019t have an orthopedic surgeon and didn\u2019t know if I needed surgery or not. I was in an ambulance for 3 more hours to get to a bigger hospital. I didn\u2019t find out until around 7 hours after my accident if I would need surgery or not.

I don't blame her for being gun-shy about having to do that alone again.  A productive approach would be for YOU to work on lining up relief care so that if another emergency comes up you have something to do with the 4 year old other than leave them for Mom to manage alone at the OB.

It can be overwhelming and hard to breathe in the moment, but you\u2019re both doing the best you can.", "NTA.", "Everyone is sympathizing with the pregnant wife. I call bullshit. Why doesn't she have plan B? Have someone else to go with her? What if he can't make it for other reasons? How did they not have a backup plan, especially with their kid being autistic? Anxiety is valid but it's not an excuse. NTA.", "I had 4 miscarriages before my current 9 month old was born. My husband came to the earlier appointments because that is when we usually found out - but after 14 weeks, I didn't expect him to come to every single appointment. If he happened to be off, then sure, it was nice. I also had to start going every week after I started having a TON of blood at 32 weeks and had a hospital stay. I didn't expect him to come to every appointment (after the hospital stay), then either! I understand the anxiety of it all, but it's not fair for her to take it out on you when you genuinely thought there was a family emergency. She should be happy you've been coming to so many as is! NTA and congratulations, and I hope everything goes smoothly for the rest of the pregnancy!", "NTA. \n\nMy opinion will not go over well with your wife. \n\nYour wife is needy and dependent and not self sufficient. Suppose you are in an auto accident or hit by a bus and end up in the hospital. Your wife and son feed off each other and have huge meltdowns you have no one to support you and make health care decisions when you are unable? Your wife is an adult and needs to manage her anxiety and definitely must learn to manage your son. You don't have a partner. You have two children and about to have three. \n\nYour mother might benefit from a grown-up to grown-up talk about the impact of her drama. It's never too late for self-improvement. \n\nGiven what u/ThrowRaThroqaw knew and when he knew it, he made the right choice. In all likelihood there was a reasonable chance of needed in-person family guidance for care. The wife on the other hand was going to a routine medical appointment and couldn't even manage to get her own son out the door. If there was bad news, emotional support would have been nice but nothing is going to change in an hour or three. Plus there are phones. \n\nOP was in a lose-lose situation. He had to do triage and I support his decision. The choice was NOT about priorities in the sense of who is more important, but about priorities in the sense of where do I need to be right now? \n\nNTA. \n\nMy wife and I support each other. We have our own strengths and weaknesses. As a result who has the lead on a matter shifts around. If one of us is not available the other one deals and we catch up when we can. My business travel puts me way off the edge of the Internet and there have been times our communication is over shortwave radio through a third party. OP's wife would have a permanent meltdown with what my wife takes in stride. \n\nFirst person to cry \"oh but she's got anxiety\" gets keel hauled, bow to stern, with a season's growth of barnacles on the bottom. She's an adult and needs to act like one.", "I agree with this judgement. I would honestly personally freak out at just \"motorcycle crash.\" I've seen enough videos.", "Imagine the potential outrage if he said something like \u201cok we\u2019ll let me know how\u2019s she\u2019s looking and if I need to head out there?\u201d", "I have to add.

He doesn\u2019t need to be there for every appointment. His wife is an adult and can manage one appointment without him for whatever reason.", "LoL. You're super wrong. NTA. \n\nIf it's \"super serious\" it's super serious. You don't wait around to double check. It's clear it's the first time his mom has done this in particular and it would be pretty shitty to stop, call around, and find out it is super serious and then have her pass before he could make it.", "This person is on one of the highest horses I've ever seen.  Showing some serious lack of empathy for someone who though his sister was in a serious motorcycle accident and reacted within a normal range of rationality", "I don\u2019t think he was overly dismissive based on the post. He was defensive probably, but those are some pretty heavy accusations being thrown by her. I understand she\u2019s anxious and has had past negative experiences with pregnancy that warrants a big reaction, but sometimes you have to show grace. She said what if something happened to the baby and he wasn\u2019t there - well what if something happened to his sister and he wasn\u2019t there? Tough situation all around, and I\u2019m not sure any decision is the right one. I hope OP and his wife come together and figure this out.", "\u201cWell it wasn\u2019t though.\u201d The wife is doing the exact same thing. She was fine with him going to the hospital until she found out SIL was fine. Only then was it a problem. Why are you giving the wife a pass for the dismissive behavior but not OP?", "Do you really think your mom was only being dramatic, or is it possible that she was scared and didn't know the extent of the injuries at the time?  A \"minor concussion\" is still a head injury and if I were to hear that one of my children were in a motorcycle accident I would think it was serious too.", "My mother would\u2019ve popped a vein even knowing I was out in the world on a motorcycle, I couldn\u2019t imagine her reaction to if I were in an accident.", "Took a bottle of crazy pills reading this thread and seeing everyone saying OP should have blindly stayed with his wife and thrown his family\u2019s concerns to the wind. Who cares if his mom is overly dramatic? His sister was in a motorcycle accident. If it were me, I could give a fuck if my mom was like that. I\u2019m going to make sure my sister is ok. My wife is an adult and while it\u2019s a really shitty situation and I would validate her feelings and how shitty it is, pretty much the only exception to not putting my wife first would be if my immediate family member was in a serious accident.", "I concur. My brother in law died in a motorcycle accident. It can very easily go either way. NAH. Difficult situation and OP tried to make the best decision in a short time. I have had ten pregnancy losses so I can commiserate with OPs wife but she needs to conquer some of that anxiety.", "Unless someone literally said they where in a bike wreck but got up after and seem moslty ok before going to the hospital.  I too would assume the worse.  I ride a motorcycle and my dad was a volunteer EMT for the fire department.  When I was little I got taken on a lot of fire calls and saw a lot of bad things.    \nI was on vacation at Destin FL one year and saw a bike wreck just outside of our hotel.  The guy had to be air lifted to hospital and it was like a 30ish? mph crash, but no helmet.  \n\n\nI have to say NAH.  Both would have been completely drained after each ones day of dealing with the issues.  If they can talk later peacefully when feeling better I think it'll be fine.", "Absolutely. It's also possible that mom didn't know how serious it was, either. If she received a call from the hospital that said, \"your daughter has been taken to hospital after a motorcycle accident,\" it would be quite normal to assume it was bad. In fact, it would be normal for the hospital to relay that she has a serious head injury in this case, because they want to prepare the family while they're still running diagnostics.", "I am going to imagine that the mother heard \u201cmotorcycle crash, come to hospital now\u201d as a mother myself, that sounds serious. I have a feeling the mom didn\u2019t know the severity until she arrives either .\n\nRedditors are rough", "You are detached from reality.\n\nMom may be dramatic, but she actually did *nothing wrong* here. She learned her daughter was in a motorcycle accident -- which are the deadliest vehicle accidents to be in, incidentally -- and called her son and told him that fact.\n\nAbsent any other details, a motorcycle crash **is** serious. Just because the sister ended up being *extremely lucky* doesn't mean it wasn't serious.\n\nThe mom wasn't overdramatic in this instance. Not at all. Way too many people in here are letting hindsight drive their criticisms and it's honestly *silly*.", "Right? How is everyone acting like a car accident is some easy thing- if I was rear ended gently at a red light my mother would be calling to my house checking on me, never mind a motorcycle crash with a head and leg injury! I don\u2019t care if she is usually dramatic, a concussion IS SERIOUS! She was not even close to dramatic in this case!", "Exactly!! If anything it made me realize how much some people only care about \u201cself\u201d and their own wants/needs, and can\u2019t find even a drop of empathy to how hard it was to OP hearing news such as that and being okay mentally without going to see for yourself. This is one of the most interesting questions I\u2019ve responded to on Reddit, and the irony of it definitely isn\u2019t lost on me & the fact that I had the loss I\u2019d had, and then went on to have a severe tbi from a car accident the next year (in only 11 months time lol) so this one definitely had me interested if for no other reason to see how so many people have a \u201cme first\u201d type personality and how they prioritize themselves/(what would\u2019ve been the wife) vs someone who could have had  a life altering trauma happen that may need a bit more care/had a  seriously bad  outcome from the whole thing. Just bc someone hits their head and it\u2019s considered \u201cconcussion\u201d doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s not a life altering situation, and that there may be more than \u201cconcussion recovery\u201d (which we usually see as taking it easy) that\u2019s going to need handled with OP\u2019s sister. Again I didn\u2019t even know my name when I came around, or where I was/why I was there. The piece of skull being removed/needing removed to help my brain swelling after the accident saved my life & all that happened was my head smashed super hard off of the dashboard & would\u2019ve  been classified as a \u201cconcussion\u201d had I not been at one of the better hospitals for brain trauma in the USA where they keep a close eye on the brain.", "I haven\u2019t seen more that a handful of comments saying he should have stayed with his wife\u2026", "Concussions can have lasting damage. I had a mild one in 2019. I was fine for a couple days  then I forgot how to do basic math, 8+9 specifically. And I have short term memory problems, eventually everything works over to long term.

I also do word salad sometimes where it's a mess of several words into one word. I forget specific words for things, the other day couldn't remember the word paper towel and said the things you dry your hands with when you wash them that's not cloth...

I had super bad whiplash that knocked my brain into the front of my skull...concussions are no joke at all.", "Heck my husband had a quadding accident when he was a teenager, went to the hospital after his head double tapped the pavement and they sent him home.

As a function of statistics, that's the deadliest type of accident to be in.", "As someone in his wife's position with high risk pregnancy and extra appointments with previous pregnancy losses: she is being irrational. The clinic I have to go for my additional scans doesn't allow children so my husband has to stay at the house with our toddler so I can go get scanned.

It happened to be the exact day we were scheduled to fly out. I was NOT happy I would then be flying cross country 6 months pregnant with a baby just shy of turning 2 all alone, but what did I do? I cancelled my husband's ticket and made work. \n\nSometimes two family situations overlap and if his sister's motorcycle accident had been worse what would the wife then do, be upset he was stressed out about his sister's situation? This would have turned into a no win situation. If anything she should be happy that his sister's accident was not as serious as first suspected because now he won't have more appointments he might miss to help out with his sister's care. \n\nAlso it is way better that someone she should reasonably care about isn't actually seriously hurt.
