Our son is specifically hard to get up and ready, especially quickly, he throws tantrums or hides when he does not want to do something, it can be a struggle trying to get him out the house. \n\nA few days ago, was our appointment, but I got a call from my mother saying my sister was being rushed to the hospital and it was super serious. I explain to my wife, head there 40 minutes away. I find out it\u2019s not as serious as they thought and my sister had a minor concussion and dislocated knee. My mom is known to be dramatic. I tell my wife, and she\u2019s furious bc I missed the appointment and she ended up being late because our son wasn\u2019t cooperating and how he screamed most the appointment. When I\u2019m there, it\u2019s easier to calm him down when he gets overwhelmed. She told me she seen where my priority\u2019s were. I told her it wasn\u2019t my fault, I didn\u2019t know my sister wasn\u2019t actually seriously injured, and she told me she\u2019s my wife, carrying our child, and that she needed me there but I wasn\u2019t reliable. She began ranting about what if she found out that day something was wrong with the baby, and I wasn\u2019t there. I said but you didn\u2019t, and she completely flipped.

If you hear \u201cmotorcycle crash\u201d and \u201cserious,\u201d the appropriate response isn\u2019t, \u201cEh, I\u2019m sure my sister\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\nSomething needs to be done about your mother\u2019s overdramatic tendencies, tho.", "NAH.\n\nA pretty tough situation to be in. But, you aren't a doctor so not sure why you were required to be there immediately?\n\nMom was stupidly dramatic, you should've clarified the situation.", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry it\u2019s in this situation that no matter what you did, you were going to upset someone. Your mum is TA for being overly dramatic and your wife should not make you choose between your sister and her, that\u2019s unfair. \n\nI would wait till she calms down slightly and have a gentle conversation about this, acknowledge her anxiety and how you want to be there - and you are. This may be like this though throughout the whole pregnancy\u2026.", "NTA. i get her anxiety is really bad, but you thought there was an emergency with a family member. that is excusable", "Nah.\n\nIt could have gone both ways. Now you know that your sister was not seriously injured but at the time you did not and chose accordingly. \n\nIt sucks that you missed the appointment but apparently nothing too mlbad happened. But your wife is  high risk pregnant and I can not imagine the anxiety she's going through. And anxiety sometimes manifests itself in lashing out to the person near you.", "NTA as far as you know your sister could have been dying, your wife's ire should be on your mother's shoulders not yours.", "It doesn't sound like pregnancy hormones. She is suffering from complications and was left with a hard to manage child with autism. How long was her appointment, and could you have done both? Did you even consider your child, too? I understand going to the hospital and even keeping tabs on your sister during your wife's appointment. The fact that you completely disregarded your immediate family might be why she's pissed.", "This is a tough one. If your wife has anxiety about the pregnancy, you really need to prioritize being there for her and helping ease her anxiety. I completely understand your decision making with the info you had, just be careful moving forward. Sincerely apologize and promise to put her first and be there for her.\n\nUltimately going to say NAH\u2026\n\nBe careful, my wife had a lot of resentment and years of working through this for a somewhat similar situation. She completely felt abandoned and lost trust in me. Fair or not, it can really strain a relationship. Try to imagine the fear and anxiety she is feeling. She needs you.", "NTA, you didn't know the injury wasn't serious. I understand that your wife is having a stressful time, but she seems completely self centered and unresponsive to reason. You did not miss the appointment on purpose. If your sister was seriously injured, it makes complete sense for you to visit her. Hopefully, you work things out with your wife if this is an unexpected response on her part.", "I'm going with NTA.  Had I gotten a call like that, my wife, with her in the OB GYN's office, she'd have told me to go.  And with what you'd been given I think you should have.", "Info : if you know your mom has tends to be overdramatic, did it cross your mind to try find out from someone else what condition your sister was really in?\n\nI'm going to lean towards NAH though, with maybe the exception of your mom who mislead you with her dramatics.", "NTA - That said, apologize to your wife. She's dealing with a lot and needs your support...hormones are massively high, now is not the time to not be there. I understand wanting to be there for a serious accident for a family member, but unless they are going into the icu, I would suggest keeping your wife, new baby, and child as first priority. As someone else pointed out, there's nothing you could've done for your sister except sit in a waiting room with your mother, meanwhile you could be very helpful to your wife. I may get downvoted and others may disagree, but that's my 2 cents", "YTA if you don't immediately take major steps to get out from your mother's thumb. This should be a huge wake-up call that you need STRONG boundaries with your mother. It sounds like this was not the first time she has lied to get you to prioritize her, and it won't be the last. \n\nFrom now on, you don't get to believe anything your mother says if it would at all be of detriment to your wife. You don't drop everything without confirmation from a TRUSTED source that whatever crisis she has concocted is real. She says someone's dying? Get confirmation from a second source. Your mother is not a trustworthy person, and you know it, so don't torpedo your marriage for her.\n\nETA: Whatever was happening with your sister, she wasn't completely alone, your mother was there. Your wife, on the other hand, was left completely alone. YOUR wife. YOUR partner.", "NAH. If she acts like this outside of pregnancies, then you'd have a problem. But this seems pretty understandable that you had no good choices to make in that situation.", "This is a tough situation it\u2019s like a mixture of an ah and no ah. You knew your mom is over dramatic but she did say a motorcycle accident and that sounds scary you reacted out of fear. However telling your wife well you didn\u2019t find out anything was wrong isn\u2019t the right thing to say especially when she is upset. Your wife was alone with a crying child on top of pregnancy she wanted your support.", "This is a tough one. However in this case I'm going to say YTA. You know your mom is prone to be dramatic and over exaggerate things. Sounds like your mom might have some narcisistic tendencies. Depends on weather or not when she exaggerates these things she ends up drawing the attention onto herself of look at poor me.... Saying this because my grandmother was just like that. \n\nYou also know how high risk the pregnancy of your wife is. The least you could have done is take your son with you, so she could at least have a peaceful appointment alone or find a last minute sitter. Last thing she needs is more stress with an already high risk pregnancy. This is the life of your unborn child you're putting in more risk than it needs to be by stressing your wife out like all hell.", "YTA. Your sister was not alone, but your wife was, with a high-risk pregnancy and a high-needs kid. You left your wife high and dry at the beck and call of your mother, who is 'known to be dramatic', to rush to your sister's side in the hospital without even knowing what was going on, and you're trying to frame your wife being upset about this as *her* being dramatic.\n\nIt's not hormones. Recalibrate your priorities, dude.", "Let me get this straight, you prioritized you sister over your pregnant wife?\n\nNow you wondering why your wife is angry with you? Gee, I wonder why..\n\nYTA", "NAH, except for your Mother. Honestly, if I heard \u201csister\u201d, \u201cmotorcycle crash\u201d and \u201cserious\u201d I\u2019d have done exactly what you did; my rational brain wouldn\u2019t have been able to kick in to ask \u201chmm can I trust that this isn\u2019t as serious?\u201d. You made a very difficult judgement call and unfortunately, it was the wrong one but I don\u2019t believe the call was in bad faith. Your wife is talking about hypotheticals on her side with the baby, but there are those for you too; what if it had been serious and it was your last chance to see your sister?\nThat being said, I think you owe your wife an apology for adding to her stress, not considering your family when you made the decision to drive 40+ mins away and not taking a second to assess the validity of your mother\u2019s claims. \nI\u2019d also be interested to know whether this has happened before? Does your mother have a habit of dragging you away from your family for \u201cemergencies\u201d; your wife\u2019s reaction was intense, and aside from pregnancy hormones/anxiety, I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s also a precedent of things like this happening before?\nA final note; you should also look at contingency planning for appointments in the future; do you have friends or loved ones nearby who could watch your son? Is there someone else your wife would trust to be at an appointment with her if you can\u2019t make it? I wonder if having these measures in place would help reduce your wife\u2019s anxiety and make her feel less reliant on your decisions. I imagine a lot of her anger is coming from feeling helpless/dependent and it\u2019s going to take time and effort from you to rebuild her trust.\nWishing you and your wife all the luck for the pregnancy and birth.", "Yes. YTA. Your pregnant wife and son needed you. You could have gone to the appointment and then gone to visit your sister. Or at least touched base with your mom (who you\u2019ve acknowledged is overly dramatic) to get an update.\n\nThe fact that you doubled down on your choice instead of trying to understand your wife\u2019s anxiety and simply apologized and committed to being there for her is ridiculous.", "[deleted]", "NTA. It feels like a tough situation to be in. \n\nThis hits a little too close to home to our family as we lost my BiL 8 years ago (today\u2019s date) in a motorcycle accident. Hope you work things out with your wife.", "YTA. Your wife is in a high risk pregnancy, she and your unborn child need to be a priority.", "NTA.  You were in a no-win situation.  You weren't obligated to go to either hospital, but you were expected to by various women.  You couldn't cut yourself in half to go to both hospitals.  So you were definitely going to piss off somebody.\n\nI think your wife needs to cut you some slack.  With what you knew before you left home, you made the difficult but logical and correct choice.", "NTA - An impossible choice to make. I would have taken dieing family member over routine appointments. Ignore her for a few hours, she will soon stop nagging", "NTA. She's gonna calm down eventually, it's just the hormones.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don\u2019t know about you, but if I hear that, I\u2019m thinking of all the people I know that have had serious motorcycle crashes, and how few of them survived.

A motorcycle accident is like an airplane crash.   It's rarely a good outcome for the rider.  He made the right call.

I love my sister but in the same circumstances I'd be more inclined to say \"I can't do anything at the hospital, do I need to pick up her kids or what can I do to help\" and weigh it up against what my wife needed.", "As OP says in one of his comments his sister was in a motorcycling accident, and it could be the mum didn\u2019t know the scale of the accident. However, being told that one of your siblings is in a motor biking accident and it\u2019s serious is going to make anyone react irrationally.", "He was told by his mum that his sister was in hospital and it was serious.

But he didn\u2019t know that.", "I can understand that, but in the post you mentioned your mom is dramatic and can get carried away sometimes. If that's the case, when you already have a wife with a complicated pregnancy why didn't it occur to you to get more info before abandoning your wife to run to the hospital? \n\nAlso your sister seemed to have emotional support from your mother where your wife only had you (based on the post) and had to go alone because you cancelled on her.

If there\u2019s no one else to verify, and mom says someone may be dying? It isn\u2019t mom that has to live with the guilt of not rushing to be there if that person does end up dying. It\u2019s OP. I would obviously try to verify with someone else, but if it can\u2019t be, I\u2019m going.", "I hear serious motorcycle crash and I'm already worried, even if those words come from someone known to be over-dramatic.
