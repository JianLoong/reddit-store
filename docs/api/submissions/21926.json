But they won't forget the time they spent with you. Besides, you sometimes buy him something. When he becomes an adult, he will definitely remember the moment when you came, gave him your attention and baked a cake with him.", "Spending time with him and making something together is not just as good of a gift.\n\nIt is a better one.\n\nYou are an amazing brother! It is odd to me that your parents are saying you are selfish and all this and that and prioritizing your friends and so forth. If that were the case, obviously you wouldn't be setting aside time for him instead of out with your friends. Time is more valuable than money. Kids grow up remembering memories made more than toys. Most parents would give a limb to have an older brother who loves his brother enough to give quality time for them as well as thoughtfulness around the other's interests. It warms my heart all the way over here!\n\nEdit: Forgot my verdict.. NTA. WAAAYYYY NTA", "NTA In the future your brother will look back on his 6th birthday and remember the fun he had with you spending time with him and making a cake. He most likely won't remember most if not all of the presents that were given to him or remember that you didn't buy him something. Congrats on being a great big brother.", "NTA - you are pretty much a kid still too no offence. You are doing a lot by being an active participant in his life and giving him fun memories of playing Lego or making a cake with him. \n\nYour parents are being weirdly sensitive about this imo. Get your finances in order before giving to others (sort of like put your air mask on first in a plane before helping others).", "NTA - you are not obligated to get your brother a gift, especially when you can\u2019t afford it. But even if you could- this isn\u2019t even a complaint from the brother, it\u2019s from the parents. He seemed perfectly happy with your gift. You spent the day with him, which is usually what kids want more than anything else. They are really out of line for putting this much pressure on you about this. I\u2019m the oldest of 4 and my youngest brother is 9 years younger than me. I too was broke and came home a lot less when I moved out. I usually would just take my brother out to eat if I had the funds when he was a kid, or just come see him. That\u2019s what he wanted more than some random toy anyway.\n\nDo your parents expect a lot out of you in other ways when it comes to your brother? I\u2019m just trying to understand where they are even coming from.", "NTA. You made a core memory with your brother on his birthday. That is something he will remember for a long time if not forever. The time he got to help make a cake with his older brother and eat it and had fun doing it. Definitely NTA.", "They do like to buy gifts a lot. That's what i'd get for my birthdays, we never did anything huge for them but the presents would be", "Not really. They expect me to be home more to see him but that's it", "NTA. Making a cake and spending the day with him sounds very nice actually. I am sure your younger brother enjoyed that.\n\nGetting into credit card debt because of nights out with your friends is another issue, and your parents are right to be concerned and open a conversation about that, but it should not be about how to manage your finances responsibly vs. your relations with brother and your friends.", "I mean he is six so he probably expected a gift. Kids don\u2019t think \u201cspending time is more important\u201d unless it was something like going somewhere. So your heart was in it but the meaning probably goes over the kid\u2019s head. Something small like a ten dollar gift probably would have helped calm those fears.\n\n\nNAH because not every misunderstanding means someone is an ass", "NTA, I promise you, your brother will remember the quality time, not whatever it was that you did or did not buy him. In fact, make it a tradition. For his birthday, you spend QT together doing something he loves.", "NTA your parents sound very materialistic! I always told my son that when friends and family came to his party that was his gift from them. That their time spent is worth way more than the money they would spend. He did get gifts I didn\u2019t want him to expect them and know that people matter more than items. He still feels that time is more precious than money at your age!", "NTA - this is way better than a plastic toy that will end up in the ocean trash island in a couple of years. Experiences and memories are way better presents.", "Nta he isn't your kid. You came and spent time with him, made something with him, and had fun. Thats about the most you might be expected to do.", "NTA. Quality time is a gift, especially when you aren't there all the time to do that. \n\nGifts come in all different shapes, sizes, and forms. Toys aren't the only gift, even for a 6 year old. \n\nYou spent the day doing the things he enjoys doing, which is something he will remember long after whatever toy you could have bought him would have been broken or lost. Memories are wonderful gifts.", "NTA \n\nI have 2 cousins who are 14 now and who practically grew up at my house. They can't tell you a single thing I ever bought them but one of them over the weekend just told me how she learned to do things like bake, cook eggs, make pancakes here. She loves cooking. The other regularly just calls me with an entire game plan to take over my house and play video games. \n\nI'm 32 and they'd both never leave my house and I never have to spend a dime on them. It's not about the presents it's about the time you spend with them. You're an amazing brother and just keep doing what you're doing.", "nta", "NTA\u2026..but a gift for your lil\u2019 bro is something you should do. My 8 year old got an old beat up hoodie from his 18 year old brother and he thinks it\u2019s the coolest thing ever because it belonged to big brother. He\u2019s 6. He doesn\u2019t fully understand the gift of time yet.", "You gave him the gift of your time and attention  which he will remember much longer than a toy.", "NTA\n\nMaking time for someone is a wonderful gift. And you are being responsible with your money.", "You know what?  I bet your bro is going to remember this special day between the 2 of you.  He probably wouldn't remember what you gave him.  But this special time that you spent with him is probably the best bday gift he got.  NTA.  Making memories is better than any gift.", "NTA.  Siblings should have bonding time together, especially with the age gap you have.  Your brother will remember making that cake a lot longer than he will remember if you brought him more Playdough.  I'm left wondering how much one-on-one time you ever got with your parents - they seem to believe \"stuff\" is more important than quality time together.\n\nAnd for the record, I'm sure I had a birthday celebration when I was six, but I'll be blessed if I can remember a single gift I got then, who was there or even what color the frosting was.  I'm only sure there was a party cause Mom took a picture and my pointy hat says \"Birthday Girl\".", "Uh yea. Lol this kid will remember this bday for the rest of his life. He wouldnt remember a lego set probably..\n\nOP you are being a cool brother.", "I believe according to his parents, Op wouldn't have such a debt in the first place, if instead of going with friends to the pub, stayed home to babysit. NTA of course, op is a great brother. I do wonder though if the parents secret wish is to parentify op.\n\nedit:  Edited the first phrase, I thought it would be obvious this was what I think op's parents reasoning was, but from the down votes, I realise it was not.", "Don't worry too much. They are exaggerating the whole thing. The most important thing is your brother happiness. You can't buy happy moments, just create them. You are a good brother.", "Soft YTA.  Kids can have difficulty understanding that an experience is a gift.  We took our Nephew to see the Lion King and walking out he asked for his present.  But lego kit or playdough is two pints at the pub and the kid is 6. So yeah...IMO...you are a little bit of an AH.", "Y T A for spending all your nights out spending money.\n\nNTA for spending time and activity with your brother.", "NTA, did something enjoyable together & spent time together.", "NTA You spent time with him, you taught him something, and there was cake. How many people do you hear saying \u201cI love (whatever hobby) because I used do it with (family member) when I was a kid?\u201d Even if he remembers the years you got him Lego, it\u2019s going to be because you helped him put it together.", "How about a goofy card? Presents lose their meaning when you get older but everyone enjoys a card.", "Nta I tell my kid she gets an experience with friends or presents for her bday she always goes for the experience with her mates", "Nta.  Kids need experiences and time.  My eldest got a lot of things, his grandma who babysat while I worked did rewards for good weeks.  Most of it all is garbage now.  It was also a reward when he was having issues at school, he's autistic and needed things to look forward to.\n\nMy youngest has had more experiences, partly because their behavior in novel settings is better, partly because if I wanted to do anything, they had to come with me.  Also, I was 18 when my eldest was born and 29 when my youngest was born and have been in a very different situation financially with the youngest.", "NTA friend.", "You gave the gift of time, attention and activity he enjoyed.  Good brother!!  Your parents want you to take 5 minutes on Amazon for some useless toy.", "NTA You are a great big brother. He\u2019s going to remember the gift of your time and making him a cake together more than any \u201cgift\u201d he got.", "NTA, my sisters and I have the same age difference. You know what my parents tell us before every birthday? Please don't buy any gifts, they have more than enough, our house is cluttered enough. Rather spent some time with them. Your parents are clearly spoiling your little brother and expecting everyone to do the same. But money can't buy happiness and great memories. Time can. You are doing a great job", "Time can be precious. I say NTA under these facts.", "NTA... spending the day and the cake was a beautiful gift. Well done.", "NTA. Spending time and doing an activity is just as good as a gift, and often better. Play dough dries out. Toys get lost and outgrown. Memories last forever.", "Your parents are dumb.  Your brother will remember his bday experience far more than any toy you could\u2019ve gotten him.", "NTA.  I remember very few gifts from my childhood.  What I *do* remember are the times I spent with my aunts/uncles/cousins/grandparents etc.  and the things we did together.  I guarantee the memory of spending the day with you and making cake with you is a memory your younger brother will cherish in years to come, long after any tangible 'gift' would have been forgotten.", "NTA\n\nHe will remember the cake baking/time spent together longer than what toy you gave him for his 6th birthday. My friend gives her teen nephews \"experience\" gifts for Christmas instead of even more stuff (they still get stuff too just not as much). Concerts, sports, weekend trips. They LOVE them. Not free but along a similar vein. They'll remember that longer than the t-shirt she got them they wore a few times then the joke wasn't popular anymore and they stopped.", "And I guarantee that the memory of baking the cake together is going to last way longer and be more meaningful than some plastic toy. It\u2019s pretty materialistic that OP\u2019s parents can\u2019t see that.", "It really just depends on the kid. Especially if the brother is into baking and such. All kids dont expect a gift even at age 6.", "Yes! \n\nI hope they took pictures. A photo of Big Brother and Little Brother baking together framed in a whimsical, colorful picture frame for Little to put in his room would make a great gift for the next gift-giving occasion, assuming OP still needs to be frugal by then. Maybe along with a kids' cookbook (you can find used versions still in pristine condition for cheap at children's consignment shops) and a promise to do more cooking together. I think the little boy would be thrilled to receive this! Most parents these days are trying to push the idea of relatives giving gifts of fun experiences rather than more plastic clutter that gets ignored after three days. OP's parents seem pretty materialistic. \n\nHe's also being a great role model for little bro. He got himself into debt (happens to a lot of young folks, and older folks too), recognized and acknowledged the problem, and is actively working to rectify the situation. I would be proud of OP if he were my son!", "OP has a right to live his life. Asking him to not incur such a debt to live his life to focus on getting gifts for his brother is unreasonable. His gifts are thoughtful and considerate.", "NTA. Your brother will always cherish the memory of spending the day with you making a cake and it suits his interests. If you bought something, he would probably grow out of it and eventually throw it away. You\u2019re allowed to have a life and go out with friends. Tbh if I had such an age gap between me and my sibling, I\u2019d find it hard to connect, so you\u2019re making a real effort. I\u2019m sure he will always look back on that day and activity fondly.", "NTA...Quality time doing something they enjoy is better than a gift they may not even like.", "NTA. They\u2019re prioritizing things while you\u2019re spending time and attention. Guarantee your brother will remember that cake years from now. The umpteenth Lego set, maybe not.", "NTA. Nobody is required to give anyone else a gift for any occasion.", "Soft YTA. You could have gotten him something for like $15 at target", "A lil bit Y T A. You could have gotten something from goodwill or made him something separately. But the verdict is really up to your brother how he feels about it. INFO has he said anything?", "YTA, but a very small one.\n\nWhile I agree with the philosophy of quality time over a gift, your brother is only 6, and has expectations of how a birthday should look. Most 6 year olds I know LOVE getting gifts, and would be upset if you showed up without one. It can be a pencil or just some stickers, they don't care, only that the ritual of unwrapping paper and then owning something is fulfilled. By not bringing anything, they don't get the ritual.\n\nI totally get and agree you didn't buy him a lego castle. But no matter how tight your finances, there is always wiggle room to squeeze out a something-in-a-giftwrapper for a kid.", "Good for you! I helped my niece make some Pok\u00e9mon out of clay for her sister's birthday because I wanted to teach her that the thought and action were the important things not how much money is spent", "NTA\n\nI'm decades older than your brother, and time means more to me than money. If someone I cared about baked a cake with me and spent the day with me for my birthday, those memories would last me much longer than some tchotchke. People can give of time, talent, or treasure, and all of them have their own intrinsic values. You gave him your time, and your baking talent.", "NTA.  Your brother will remember the time you spent with him,  not the gifts you give him.", "NTA- your lil brother will remember the time you spend with him more than all the toys you have bought for him, Yes, there will be a few he will treasure the most. Keep up your good work! You can buy him something on the next visit be it Christmas or his birthday again. Hope you get out of your debt soon, great to hear you're managing your debt.\n\nI am my niece's favourite uncle, I had been caring and babysit her since the day she was born until she was 5 plus near 6 before she went back and stayed full-time with her parents. Today she was 8, every time she come around , she is just happy to see me and just wanted to spend time together. \n\nShe remembered all the fun times we had together playing princess, I'm being silly, building a fort, the dinosaur story I told her and our goodnight sleeping song and many more. The toys, gifts and whatever is secondary to them. Only a few she keeps close to her such as her bunny doll (been with her since baby) and just a few things.\n\nI bet your lil brother feels the same, spending quality time with him, all those materials toys is meaningless as the tide of time will swallows it away. Cheers and keep up your good work! Spend more time with him too. I bet when you look back it will make you feel happy too!", "NTA - Honestly? 20yrs from now he wont recall what you got him as a gift for his 6th bday unless it was life-changing (ie. a pony).\n\nHe WILL, however, remember spending the day with you making, decorating, eating cake, playing, hugs, etc etc. If you snapped pix, he will look back with even fonder memories.", "NTA but if you did want to get him a gift go to the dollar store and get some play dough or something you can do together :) You\u2019re an awesome brother!!", "NTA-you\u2019re doing what you can. I\u2019m sure he enjoyed the cake you made and the time you spent together. Don\u2019t put yourself in debt because of the judgement from others", "NTA- I\u2019m sure your little brother loved spending the time with you to make his own cake, I\u2019m sure he wasn\u2019t too phased about not getting a gift (I see a cake as a gift) kids love the time they get to spend with you especially if it\u2019s something like what you\u2019ve done. Considering you also spend time with him and buy him stuff when it\u2019s not his birthday would also show him you care.", "NTA, sounds like your folks value material items more than anything else. You created a core memory with your brother that day and thats something he'll always have, compared to a toy most likely made from plastic that will break.", "This is literally that episode from Victorious when Tori writes a song and puts on a performance for her sister\u2019s birthday and right after it Trina asks her for her gift lol.", "NTA. Love and celebration doesn\u2019t need a big price tag to be enjoyed. You made a memory. You gave a child your time. I PROMISE that means more to him than stuff. Grown ups always forget that. \n\nThe only thing you could have done better is to have thought to take a picture of the fun you had together (maybe you did!) and put it in a fun (cheap) frame that you decorated just or him. I say that only because I always forget to take pictures when I\u2019m having experiences with my kids. I wish I was better at that. \n\nYou\u2019re a fantastic sister and don\u2019t let old people, who forgot that time together is always better than money/stuff, rain on your parade. You did great for your brother.", "I bet your lil brother feels the same, spending quality time with him, all those materials toys is meaningless as the tide of time will swallows it away.", "She remembered all the fun times we had together playing princess, I'm being silly, building a fort, the dinosaur story I told her and our goodnight sleeping song and many more.", "I'm decades older than your brother, and time means more to me than money."]}
