But they won't forget the time they spent with you. Besides, you sometimes buy him something. When he becomes an adult, he will definitely remember the moment when you came, gave him your attention and baked a cake with him.", "Spending time with him and making something together is not just as good of a gift.\n\nIt is a better one.\n\nYou are an amazing brother! It is odd to me that your parents are saying you are selfish and all this and that and prioritizing your friends and so forth. If that were the case, obviously you wouldn't be setting aside time for him instead of out with your friends. Time is more valuable than money. Kids grow up remembering memories made more than toys. Most parents would give a limb to have an older brother who loves his brother enough to give quality time for them as well as thoughtfulness around the other's interests. It warms my heart all the way over here!\n\nEdit: Forgot my verdict.. NTA. WAAAYYYY NTA", "NTA In the future your brother will look back on his 6th birthday and remember the fun he had with you spending time with him and making a cake. He most likely won't remember most if not all of the presents that were given to him or remember that you didn't buy him something. Congrats on being a great big brother.", "NTA - you are pretty much a kid still too no offence. You are doing a lot by being an active participant in his life and giving him fun memories of playing Lego or making a cake with him. \n\nYour parents are being weirdly sensitive about this imo. Get your finances in order before giving to others (sort of like put your air mask on first in a plane before helping others).", "NTA - you are not obligated to get your brother a gift, especially when you can\u2019t afford it. But even if you could- this isn\u2019t even a complaint from the brother, it\u2019s from the parents. He seemed perfectly happy with your gift. You spent the day with him, which is usually what kids want more than anything else. They are really out of line for putting this much pressure on you about this. I\u2019m the oldest of 4 and my youngest brother is 9 years younger than me. I too was broke and came home a lot less when I moved out. I usually would just take my brother out to eat if I had the funds when he was a kid, or just come see him. That\u2019s what he wanted more than some random toy anyway.\n\nDo your parents expect a lot out of you in other ways when it comes to your brother? I\u2019m just trying to understand where they are even coming from.", "NTA. You made a core memory with your brother on his birthday. The hat is something he will remember for a long time if not forever. The time he got to help make a cake with his older brother and eat it and had fun doing it. Definitely NTA.", "They do like to buy gifts a lot. That's what i'd get for my birthdays, we never did anything huge for them but the presents would be", "Not really. They expect me to be home more to see him but that's it"]}
