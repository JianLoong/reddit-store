You made a good point, he heard, I wouldn\u2019t dwell on it.", "YTA. You said it specifically to fuck with your brother. Your intentions were bad.", "YTA, because of course you are.", "ESH. Your brother and his friend have a super unhealthy dynamic and your obsession with it is sad. Also, other people finding your remark humorous doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t a crappy thing to say. Get a life and stop obsessing over your brother and his friend.", "Yes, YTA, but very funny.", "NTA but I feel sorry for your brother in a way \nPoor guy I wonder if he gay or bi", "I don't know, call me paranoid but it almost seems like Nate likes it when Kyle drives off the girlfriends so that he doesn't have to break up with them (most white knights I've met are really bad at being the bad guy) but now that Kyle and Gemma are buddy buddy, when he's tired of this relationship he's going to have to do it himself and there's a chance Kyle will still be friends with Gemma. \n\nProbably reading too much into this but here it is.", "Glory to Gemma", "This has nothing to do with Gemma though. This is about Nate.  \n\nYou know the guy who's watching his partner feed his best friend in front of him and his family.  And while trying to remain calm and not cause a scene has his sister rub it in his face. \n\n\nYea OPs the AH and a crap sister", "Hey I know Nate enjoys being the white knight to Kyle\u2019s damsel in distress. You need two to tango", "I don\u2019t know what he wants. Does he WANT his girlfriend and his best friend to hate each other?", "Just because you say something that's true doesn't mean OPs not an AH. \n\nShe made a \"joke\" at her brothers defense, knowing the situation made him upset. That's what assholes do see someone misery and make a joke out if it", "It was just a joke to lighten the mood", "I just made a joke to listen the mood since he looked pissed. I thought he would realize how dumb he was being", "Nate brought it on himself. He could've told Kyle to back off when he mistreated his previous girlfriends. Instead he let Kyle be disrespectful to them. This time he picked a clever girl and Gemma outsmarted the both of them. Maybe Nate should learn to set boundaries with Kyle and stop letting his friend mistreat his partners.", "Probably.  There's nothing/no one to rescue if the princess tames the dragon herself, and it seems that Gemma has done just that.\n\nYour brother likely enjoyed the chaos, and now that there's no chaos, there's nothing for him to feel, except inadequate.", "Your grammar is almost as bad as your logic.\n\nBrother lets his friend constantly mistreat his partners and finally a partner comes along that rolls with it and the brother is mad.  Cry me a river, the brother and his friend are AH\u2019s, especially if they can\u2019t take a simple joke after all that drama.  The brother deserves a lot worse than one joke.", "Her brother\u2019s expense**", "How exactly is this a joke?", "Agree he bought the situation on himself but for you really think that gives his family to kick him when he's down? \n\nAgain just because something is true doesn't give someone the right to insult you over it and make you feel worst about yourself.  That's not what loved ones do.  Again that's what assholes do", "The brother enjoyed people fighting over who loved him more. He feels belittled because this time no one is fighting over him, and he's not the center of a toxic little love triangle drama.", "The classic it was ajoke line.", "Its a joke cuz its funny \ud83d\udc4d", "Me thinks this is OP's brother. These comments are too defensive to be an impartial commenter. Nate, you effed up. Stop letting your friend haze your girlfriends.", "Me think you know I'm right that only an asshole would make a joke to their sibling while actively seeing they're upset. But you couldn't think if an actual response so you went to the lazy well you must be the other person. \n\nThat or your OP and commented N T A after you noticed no one else here agree with you.", "None of that rambling made any sense. Whole bunch of word salad, defensiveness, and butthurt. Swallow your pride and take the L. Treat your girlfriends better and they wouldn't need to give you a dose of your own medicine.", "He deserves to be upset though. He\u2019s hurt everyone else by making them put up with his asshole friend until they can\u2019t take it anymore because he enjoys having people fight over him or be insulted by his friend. Finally someone isn\u2019t fighting for attention and approval from him and getting mad at his friend so he is upset.", "Ok OP", "NTA\n\n>Gemma and Kyle naturally were there. Instead of the usual, Kyle kept hanging off GEMMA\u2019S shoulder! He asked her to explain everything and had her feed him snacks.\n\n> Gemma just started doing stuff for him. He doesn\u2019t know how to cook and needs to call Nate? Gemma comes over with a recipe book. He can\u2019t do his taxes? Here comes Gemma\n\n I get that she outfoxed him, however if I was your brother I'd probably be more upset because it seems like they're are a little too close, that could just be me.", "I mean this is hilarious. I would watch this sitcom.", "NTA and congratulations on the polycule! This is probably the best any Kyle-Nate-GF-situation could have worked out", "NTA, but it makes me wonder about the nature of your brother's relationship with Kyle...", "The Iranian yogurt and I beg to differ.", "no, it's not just you...", "Well considering the brother has always stuck up for Kyle whenever he insults OP or others. Surely if Kyle is a good friend then he should have stood up for Nate.\n\nNate is only suffering from the consequences of his actions. OP's comments are also a consequence of his actions - he cultivated an attitude of insulting \"banter\" amongst OP, himself and Kyle by his inaction to his friend's insults in the past. Why is Kyle allowed to make shitty insults about OP and girlfriends constantly but OP isn't allowed to make a good joke at his expense?\n\nIs this a potential sexist issue? Does the brother only allow Kyle to insult women he knows, does he allow the same behaviour towards his dad from Kyle?"]}
