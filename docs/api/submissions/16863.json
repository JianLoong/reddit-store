Your brother and his friend have a super unhealthy dynamic and your obsession with it is sad. Also, other people finding your remark humorous doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t a crappy thing to say. Get a life and stop obsessing over your brother and his friend.", "Yes, YTA, but very funny.", "NTA but I feel sorry for your brother in a way \nPoor guy I wonder if he gay or bi", "I don't know, call me paranoid but it almost seems like Nate likes it when Kyle drives off the girlfriends so that he doesn't have to break up with them (most white knights I've met are really bad at being the bad guy) but now that Kyle and Gemma are buddy buddy, when he's tired of this relationship he's going to have to do it himself and there's a chance Kyle will still be friends with Gemma. \n\nProbably reading too much into this but here it is.", "Glory to Gemma", "This has nothing to do with Gemma though.

That's what assholes do see someone misery and make a joke out if it", "It was just a joke to lighten the mood", "I just made a joke to listen the mood since he looked pissed. I thought he would realize how dumb he was being", "Nate brought it on himself. He could've told Kyle to back off when he mistreated his previous girlfriends. Instead he let Kyle be disrespectful to them. This time he picked a clever girl and Gemma outsmarted the both of them. Maybe Nate should learn to set boundaries with Kyle and stop letting his friend mistreat his partners.", "Probably.  There's nothing/no one to rescue if the princess tames the dragon herself, and it seems that Gemma has done just that.\n\nYour brother likely enjoyed the chaos, and now that there's no chaos, there's nothing for him to feel, except inadequate.", "Your grammar is almost as bad as your logic.\n\nBrother lets his friend constantly mistreat his partners and finally a partner comes along that rolls with it and the brother is mad.

He\u2019s hurt everyone else by making them put up with his asshole friend until they can\u2019t take it anymore because he enjoys having people fight over him or be insulted by his friend.

Surely if Kyle is a good friend then he should have stood up for Nate.\n\nNate is only suffering from the consequences of his actions. OP's comments are also a consequence of his actions - he cultivated an attitude of insulting \"banter\" amongst OP, himself and Kyle by his inaction to his friend's insults in the past. Why is Kyle allowed to make shitty insults about OP and girlfriends constantly but OP isn't allowed to make a good joke at his expense?\n\nIs this a potential sexist issue?

Makes me think that he's jealous. Is there a possibility he's in love with Kyle bit in denial?", "NTA", "NTA.\nIt might've been a bit mean, but at some point your brother needs to star rethinking some stuff... Its not that bad for you to call the bs out. The whole situation weirded me out tbh", "Did you warn Gemma about Kyle?", "NTA. I\u2019m mostly concerned about Genna. Why is she wasting time with these idiots?", "It's always a Kyle...", "Nta but is there anyway the guy is gay for your bro?

I'm glad you actually trained yours or at least are responsible enough to keep her away from situations where she would bite!", "Why feel sorry for the brother.

It's definitely a wooing", "It would be so ironic though if Kyle would run off with her after he's been the driving away source for so long.", "It was sarcasm", "The fact that the tall baby has people fighting him is astounding. \n\nI guess if Gemma wants to settle, fine.", "Right!?!?
