He shouldn't have tried to force the decision this way, but it also sounds like you have had Christmas your way for a long time and you still aren't listening to him - you sound like you're still demanding Christmas with your parents.

Good grief, try communicating with each other. Maybe Christmas is difficult for him without the traditional time with his parents.

Do you ask him every year? \n\nHas he said he didn't want to and did you pushed, maybe saying you don't even have a turkey to cook? \n\nHow much do you normally communicate your Christmas plans with him, does he have a choice every year?", "We are taking this as a hard no that you do not consult him because why else would you avoid the question", "So you can't drive her home? How do you get to and from your parents?", "The OP is just skirting questions here it seems", "My parents are within walking distance if we want to, and yes I could drive her, it\u2019s not a problem. But she tends to say no.", "At this point, not answering the question _is_ answering the question.", "Yup, noticed that too. \n\nSo let's see, her parents helped them get there house, within walking distance of the parents of course. \n\nHe feels they are over bearing and she admits that's the case. \n\nThey have not spent a Christmas just the two of them. \n\nHe bought a Christmas Turkey at the beginning of November. That sounds like a desperate act. \n\nHow much you want to bet that this is an ongoing issue that has come up year after year and the wife's excuse is is too late to get anything and her parents already have the bird so let's just go there?", "Definitely that's the case. I m guessing she is not supporting her husband when he is being embarassed by his in-laws. I feel the house given to them is less a gift but more of a leash the in-laws are using on her husband.\nWhich is why he is feeling like he cannot take any independent decision or take any decision as a couple without getting any interference from their in laws."]}
