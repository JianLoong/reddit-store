He shouldn't have tried to force the decision this way, but it also sounds like you have had Christmas your way for a long time and you still aren't listening to him - you sound like you're still demanding Christmas with your parents.

Good grief, try communicating with each other. Maybe Christmas is difficult for him without the traditional time with his parents.

Last year, he enjoyed himself as well.", "Okay but he went out a bought a whole turkey, who's gonna cook the turkey that he went out and impulsively bought and then as you put it \"talked about\" once he got home? Bet you bottom dollar HE is EXPECTING HER to cook it for HIM without a second thought.", "\"I'd like to have lunch at my parents \" is assuming he'll say yes? I see it as an opening to a conversation,  where he'd say what he wants and we try to make sure we both get some of what we want. Like, I'd didn't want that, he'd say, \"can we just do Christmas ourselves this year, and see your parents Christmas Eve or Boxing Day?\" \n\nHe needs to speak up if he doesn't like something,  not stew and then snap.", "Saying \"I'd like to have lunch at my parents\" is not \"We're going to have lunch at my parents\"\n\nShe's saying what she'd like to do, while giving him an opportunity to say he doesn't want to. She's not making him go, going without him, or taking the decision away. But he is trying to take the decision away from her and even telling her it's not her choice to make. He is the obvious asshole.\n\nI'm honestly quite shocked people are saying y t a. She's clearly NTA and the husband is. If he really doesn't want to go he should tell her he'd prefer to just be at home with her for Christmas and compromise visiting parents the day before or after. But instead he told her they're saying home and that she didn't get to decide otherwise. That's controlling and a red flag. \n\nBut I guess that since she wants to see her parents on Christmas and has every year without him even saying he doesn't want to, she's the asshole for \"forcing\" him to go.", "Maybe, but is that relevant? This conflict doesn't boil down to OP insisting on different Christmas plans.

She's not thinking about Christmas plans.  \n>  \n>She said they hadn't discussed xmas plans yet.\n\nShe also refuses to answer the question if they even discuss it.  Seems like OP just assumes that this is their xmas tradition to go to their parents house so that is how it is.\n\nThe husband is tired of her just assuming that this is how it is and bought a turkey to stay at home.  Yes it's being a bit passive aggressive but if OP doesn't consult her husband and just says they are going I can see why he did it.", "Well, that's the thing. Conflict avoidance works short term, maybe medium term. Long term it usually leads to a worse conflict down the line. Doesn't mean it's not what he was trying to do, though. It's very common behavior.", "Or he was ok every other year, but he\u2019s not ok this year?", ">Then he isn't mature enough for an adult relationship.\n\nBy that metric, a great, great, great deal of people aren't.
