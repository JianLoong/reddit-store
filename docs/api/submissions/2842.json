You had no proof she was going on campus with alcohol. You made a scenario up in your mind and tried to get your RA in trouble with this made up delusion.", "YTA. You were playing get back and it backfired on you whereas she was doing her job when she busted you. Stay out of other people\u2019s business.", "YTA. You made an unsubstantiated allegation to get her in trouble.", "YTA and the RA did the right thing by avoiding you. Because it doesn't look like you feel guilty about falsely accusing her nor are you planning to apologize anytime soon. again YTA", "YTA. You made accusations without proof. Take your licks and learn.", "YTA.\n\nIt's Rebecca's job to enforce the standards in your dorm. It is not her job to be \"chill\" socialize with you, be popular, be warm, kiss your butt, or make it easy to break the rules.\n\nYou admit that she caught you drinking at the beginning of the year. You also seem to know where to buy alcohol. Yet stores that sell alcohol also sell other things ranging from gasoline to panty liners. She may not have entered the store to buy anything; she might simply know someone who works there. You don't seem to be aware of that, nor do you seem to be aware that most seniors are over 21 and have the right to walk into whatever bar they please and get blotto. Rebecca could be snorting cocaine and dancing on a pole at the local topless bar, and it would be none of your business or anyone else's.\n\nBased on the fact Rebecca walked into a store, you came up with an entire bogus narrative and started a smear campaign against her, first with your friend and then with your boss. That is a dumb move even for a freshman, and your pettiness is pretty extreme. Rebecca is right to limit her interactions with you for filing a false report. For all she knows, next time you'll report her for shoplifting, cheating on an exam, treason, or murder. You'd better believe that not crossing paths with a malicious liar is for the \"best\". Your next RA will probably not trust you either. College residency is about to get uncomfortable for you.", "YTA\n\nLet me reword your post for you.\n\n\"AITA? I chose to attend a dry college. I then broke the law and drank underage on campus even though I know it's a dry campus regardless of age. My RA was doing the job she's paid to do, she caught me, and I got in trouble. I then witnessed my RA enter a store that happened to sell alcohol, so I acted like a petty vindictive brat and reported her to her boss. Now I got switched to a new RA and the girl I reported for no reason and with no proof thinks I'm a jerk. Am I the AH?\"", "YTA. Grow up.", "YTA, what you did was retaliation for her doing her job. You didn\u2019t see her break any rules but you tattled to her boss with absolutely no evidence of wrong-doing. Because she did catch you not only breaking the rules but also breaking the law. Grow up.", "YTA.\n\nShe is actually being professional by limiting her interactions with you, given your attempt to sabotage her.    \n\nLet's see how long you last before you piss off the downstairs RA.", "OP, you are a spiteful little thing, aren't you?  I'm sure the reason Rebecca is standoffish is because she recognizes her role as an RA and doesn't want to create an issue with blurring lines between an RA and a student.  She's right to do this as well as refer you to another RA to protect her from your childish games.\n\nWhy do you care if she's buying booze OFF CAMPUS?  Oh yeah, she busted you for breaking rules and you want to get back at her.  Whatever she does off campus is HER BUSINESS.\n\nGrow up.  YTA.", "YTA. This is so childish and petty. Grow up. You wanna drink? Then move off campus like a big girl.", "YTA Stop throwing your toys out of the play pen and grow up. You got busted. You reported your RA for going into a store. The complaint was addressed and  matter has been handled. You will now deal with another RA. Why are you whining about it?", "YTA. Grow up and mind your own business.", "YTA. You got caught doing something you weren\u2019t supposed to by someone doing their job. Stop being immature and trying to get revenge on her for doing what she\u2019s supposed to.", "YTA.  You unequivocally broke the rules by drinking.  You then tried to get Rebecca in trouble for...being in roughly the same vicinity as alcohol, despite zero evidence she ever actually touched any.  And you seriously can't figure out if you're the asshole here?  Frankly, it's a credit to her professionalism and maturity that she's simply not going to put herself in a position to have to deal with you again for better or worse, instead of following your example and looking for opportunities to retaliate.", "YTA. I have no idea why you\u2019re taking this and what she\u2019s doing so personal. How does it concern you in any way?", "\"I think my RA is a b*tch because she caught me breaking the rules so I tried to get her in trouble, and I'm now surprised she doesn't want to talk to me. AITA?\"\n\nYeah dude. YTA a lot.", "YTA-Buying alcohol doesn\u2019t automatically mean she\u2019s drinking on campus.  My dorm had rules against drinking alcohol and when I was old enough to legally purchase alcohol you\u2019d find me buying it and drinking with friends at parties or their homes not on campus. You and your friends jumped to conclusions that weren\u2019t necessarily true.", "YTA. You were salty about getting caught breaking the rules, so you lied to try to ruin someone's lives. She's doing her job, not having 'no chill'. Colleges have rules for a reason like, and it's usually to keep students safe.", "YTA. Absolutely. She caught you breaking the rules so you thought you'd try to pay her back by  attempting to get her in trouble?\nYou need to grow up and quit this toxic behaviour.", "YTA.\n\nRebecca is of age and purchased alcohol off-campus. She did nothing wrong.", "YTA. Don\u2019t go crying wolf. Person if legal age, goes off campus and goes into a liquor store. You didn\u2019t say you saw her come out and even if you did, you didn\u2019t see her on campus with it. So  you go running blindly to her boss and report what you assumed happened in an attempt to get her in trouble because she held you and your friends, who are underage, accountable, for drinking on campus. RA\u2019s are put in place to make sure people like yourself, follow the rules laid out by the administration of the school. She\u2019s not there to be your bestie or bff. She\u2019s there to keep your dumbass from getting kicked out of school or worse.", "So to summarize,  you made a false report on your RA in retaliation and are wondering why she is choosing to no longer interact with you? YTA", "YTA", "YTA", "I\u2019m an RA that enforces no rules except those that prevent harm to others. YTA. Rebecca was doing her job. You are acting like a child. There is also such a distinction between a senior and freshman. You\u2019ll cringe at this later.", "YTA.\n\nYou got caught breaking the rules, and you're so angry over it you tried to get this person into trouble and lose *their* job... for DOING the job they're supposed to be doing. How petty and immature of you.", "YTA you tried to rat her out, possibly effecting her housing and her last year of college because you just wanted to stir some shit up, over your make believe story. You crossed a line sending that email, good luck for the rest of the year after that.", "YTA. You want to get this person in trouble, just because you find her \"cold\"? Grow up.", "YTA. I got caught smoking weed in my dorm by an RA who told me they smoke in their room. I'm still not gonna snitch just cause they had to do their job tho. What if work-study was their only way to pay for school? You cool with getting them kicked out with a mark on their record?", "YTA. Hugely. \n\nRebecca is an RA. Enforcing the dorm rules is literally her job. She caught you underage drinking in her role as an RA. You saw her go into a store off campus that sells alcohol, likely among other things. The situations are in no way comparable.", "YTA", "YTA u switched and had no evidence I wouldn't want to deal with u either..u tried to play tit for tat cause u got caught", "YTA. She is legal age. You are not. You did not see her drink on campus.", "So you messed up and got caught breaking the rules and decided you would retaliate by tattling on her with zero proof whatsoever? Yes, YTA and a childish one at that.", "Yta. She has a responsibility to do her job as RA, but you just out here snitching because you\u2019re salty.  Mind your own business good lord.", "YTA. She busted you and your buddies actually drinking ( while underage if you are in the US) but you saw her entering a place which sells booze and just assume she is drinking on campus? So you report her for drinking on campus even though you don't even know if she bought anything? Revenge narcing gone bad. She was just doing her job reporting you, you are just taking a stab in the dark as revenge. Just because someone enters a place of business that happens to sell booze does not mean they are purchasing said booze.", "YTA. Her boss is right: what she does off campus isn't his OR YOUR business.\n\nYou fucked around, and now you're finding out. Enjoy dealing with a different RA and having zero prospects about being friends with any of them.", "YTA\n\nIt is clear that you were trying to get revenge on her, and you were not legitimately concerned about keeping a dry campus. If she actually had drinks on campus, you'd be in the clear as I can understand calling out hypocrites.", "College is about learning, and you learned that you need proof and that petty vengeance will get you nowhere. You also learned play stupid games win stupid prizes.\n\nYta", "Dude I know being a freshman in college is exciting and RAs are a buzzkill, but YTA just take a chill pill dude and focus less on the RA and more on your classes, you\u2019re paying too much money to waste it stressing on your RA", "YTA for simply jumping to conclusions in an effort to get someone you don't like in trouble.", "You broke the rules and then report your RA without proof. Not cool. YTA", "Yes, YTA. Any other questions, genius?", "YTA", "YTA\n\nYou already know why.", "YTA, you were trying to get someone in trouble for no reason other than you don't like them.", "INFO: why did you think the RA was going back to campus with their alcohol instead of going to say an off campus party?", "YTA but Rebecca is probably an AH too.\n\n> I saw her go into one of the places in town where you can buy alcohol....we clearly thought she was drinking on campus. So I emailed her boss what I saw.\n\nEmailing her boss because you saw her in a liquor store is ridiculous. You're probably drinking on campus too so stop being a nerd and trying to get her in trouble. You know you fill your backpacks with alcohol and try to keep the bottles from clanging while walking to your dorm room just like she does.\n\nDon't drink and hide it harder, just drink smarter lol", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
