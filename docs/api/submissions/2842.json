You made an unsubstantiated allegation to get her in trouble.", "YTA and the RA did the right thing by avoiding you. Because it doesn't look like you feel guilty about falsely accusing her nor are you planning to apologize anytime soon. again YTA", "YTA. You made accusations without proof. Take your licks and learn.", "YTA.\n\nIt's Rebecca's job to enforce the standards in your dorm. It is not her job to be \"chill\" socialize with you, be popular, be warm, kiss your butt, or make it easy to break the rules.\n\nYou admit that she caught you drinking at the beginning of the year. You also seem to know where to buy alcohol. Yet stores that sell alcohol also sell other things ranging from gasoline to panty liners. She may not have entered the store to buy anything; she might simply know someone who works there. You don't seem to be aware of that, nor do you seem to be aware that most seniors are over 21 and have the right to walk into whatever bar they please and get blotto. Rebecca could be snorting cocaine and dancing on a pole at the local topless bar, and it would be none of your business or anyone else's.\n\nBased on the fact Rebecca walked into a store, you came up with an entire bogus narrative and started a smear campaign against her, first with your friend and then with your boss. That is a dumb move even for a freshman, and your pettiness is pretty extreme. Rebecca is right to limit her interactions with you for filing a false report. For all she knows, next time you'll report her for shoplifting, cheating on an exam, treason, or murder. You'd better believe that not crossing paths with a malicious liar is for the \"best\". Your next RA will probably not trust you either. College residency is about to get uncomfortable for you.", "YTA\n\nLet me reword your post for you.\n\n\"AITA? I chose to attend a dry college. I then broke the law and drank underage on campus even though I know it's a dry campus regardless of age. My RA was doing the job she's paid to do, she caught me, and I got in trouble. I then witnessed my RA enter a store that happened to sell alcohol, so I acted like a petty vindictive brat and reported her to her boss.

I'm sure the reason Rebecca is standoffish is because she recognizes her role as an RA and doesn't want to create an issue with blurring lines between an RA and a student.  She's right to do this as well as refer you to another RA to protect her from your childish games.\n\nWhy do you care if she's buying booze OFF CAMPUS?  Oh yeah, she busted you for breaking rules and you want to get back at her.  Whatever she does off campus is HER BUSINESS.\n\nGrow up.  YTA.", "YTA. This is so childish and petty. Grow up. You wanna drink? Then move off campus like a big girl.", "YTA Stop throwing your toys out of the play pen and grow up. You got busted. You reported your RA for going into a store.

You unequivocally broke the rules by drinking.  You then tried to get Rebecca in trouble for...being in roughly the same vicinity as alcohol, despite zero evidence she ever actually touched any.

You and your friends jumped to conclusions that weren\u2019t necessarily true.", "YTA. You were salty about getting caught breaking the rules, so you lied to try to ruin someone's lives. She's doing her job, not having 'no chill'. Colleges have rules for a reason like, and it's usually to keep students safe.", "YTA. Absolutely. She caught you breaking the rules so you thought you'd try to pay her back by  attempting to get her in trouble?\nYou need to grow up and quit this toxic behaviour.", "YTA.\n\nRebecca is of age and purchased alcohol off-campus. She did nothing wrong.", "YTA. Don\u2019t go crying wolf. Person if legal age, goes off campus and goes into a liquor store. You didn\u2019t say you saw her come out and even if you did, you didn\u2019t see her on campus with it. So  you go running blindly to her boss and report what you assumed happened in an attempt to get her in trouble because she held you and your friends, who are underage, accountable, for drinking on campus. RA\u2019s are put in place to make sure people like yourself, follow the rules laid out by the administration of the school. She\u2019s not there to be your bestie or bff.

I got caught smoking weed in my dorm by an RA who told me they smoke in their room. I'm still not gonna snitch just cause they had to do their job tho.

Enforcing the dorm rules is literally her job. She caught you underage drinking in her role as an RA. You saw her go into a store off campus that sells alcohol, likely among other things.

You are not. You did not see her drink on campus.", "So you messed up and got caught breaking the rules and decided you would retaliate by tattling on her with zero proof whatsoever? Yes, YTA and a childish one at that.", "Yta. She has a responsibility to do her job as RA, but you just out here snitching because you\u2019re salty.  Mind your own business good lord.", "YTA. She busted you and your buddies actually drinking ( while underage if you are in the US) but you saw her entering a place which sells booze and just assume she is drinking on campus? So you report her for drinking on campus even though you don't even know if she bought anything? Revenge narcing gone bad. She was just doing her job reporting you, you are just taking a stab in the dark as revenge. Just because someone enters a place of business that happens to sell booze does not mean they are purchasing said booze.", "YTA. Her boss is right: what she does off campus isn't his OR YOUR business.\n\nYou fucked around, and now you're finding out. Enjoy dealing with a different RA and having zero prospects about being friends with any of them.", "YTA\n\nIt is clear that you were trying to get revenge on her, and you were not legitimately concerned about keeping a dry campus.

So I emailed her boss what I saw.\n\nEmailing her boss because you saw her in a liquor store is ridiculous. You're probably drinking on campus too so stop being a nerd and trying to get her in trouble.
