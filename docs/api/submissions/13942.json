They were together for more than a decade. Two weeks ago I got a call in the middle of the night, she was sobbing, could barely breath.

She can\u2019t sleep because all she can hear is that he isn\u2019t breathing by her side. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince then she is staying with us, in the guest bedroom. She can stay as long as she wants. I have always been very family oriented and my husband knows this. Right now my sister is my absolute priority and no one who knows me should expect otherwise. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast night my husband asked to talk. Said that she had to go, she is freaking him out. That it feels like there is a ghost in HIS house. I was pissed. How dare him? And I told him so. It\u2019s not his house, it\u2019s not our house. It\u2019s MINE goddamn house. Just like everything else in our lives he has made separate? The house is mine. My sister stays however long she wants. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe has been acting dejected ever since. I don\u2019t really care and my sister is staying. He can leave if he wants. But I like to know if I\u2019m acting like an asshole. I prefer to be an aware asshole.

I think it's good of you to help your sister, but I suspect you had a little smug satisfaction in this situation, gloating over your ownership of the house. \n\nI do think ESH because of this, and also because while your husband behaves in a petty manner with money and ownership, so did you. You do live together after all, and he is your husband. Why wouldn't he have some say in who gets to stay in his (yes, his) home? Whether or not his name is on the deed or his money goes to the mortgage is irrelevant. You are supposed to be partners in life. You should consult each other in matters like this. And your complete disregard for his opinion means you don't see him as an equal. And maybe fair enough, that he's been rather petty in the past with money. But if you were really okay with that, then I don't think you'd feel as entitled to put your foot down as you do here. \n\nDo you think it may be time to reconsider your division of finances?

Marriage is supposed to be a partnership and sorry this does not sound like one. Are you planning to have kids? How do you split the finances then? What happens if there is an issue with the house and your finances can\u2019t accommodate it? Ma\u2019am you sound very naive to some major issues that will torpedo your relationship. Im curious what happens when you get sick, will he keep a tab for repayment? Are you forever wanting to nickel and dime your relationship? \n\nAlso do you have a prenup? Did you buy the house before the marriage or during? If so you realize that he will get half.

Too bad he can't be that. \n\nI think he was OK splitting as long as he had the upper hand (as with even splitting or him benefiting as with the housing situation). He doesn't need to have 50-50. He needs to pay AT MOST 50. That makes him a huge AH. If he were principled he would pay you rent and utilities.\n\nIt makes me wonder though, if you were in need financially, let's say for a medical reason, would he pay?

In her room, she has full creative control and can decorate it and use it however she wants.
