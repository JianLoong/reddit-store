Kinda anyway....lol", "In our building, if the load is in the washer, all anyone has ever done is lift the lid and wait for someone to come back for their clothes...honestly not sure what would happen if I put my mitts on another person's full load of laundry!

It creeps me out too, but with the laundry being free to do at my own apartment building I pushed passed it. All I really ever do is one-two loads anyways.
