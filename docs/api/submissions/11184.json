I worked remote so it's easy to pick up and go and this is my first time doing it. I was laid off recently but since I have a lot of money saved and the trip has already been paid for, I've decided to go for a sabbatical. For months, I have had to convince my parents, grandparents, and siblings that I am going to safe places, that I have enough money, and that they don't need to worry. I finally had them in a good spot. I leave in about 2 weeks.\n\nRecently though, things have changed. I normally end up taking care of my niece (2F) for my sister (32F) at least once a week. My sister goes to work 3 days a week and works 2 days from home, and her husband (39M) works from home but has to stay near his computer at all times since he works in customer service. On the weekends, they enjoy going out to things like hockey games, dinner, etc. I normally take care of my niece during those times. It tends to work out because they will go out on Sunday so I will have my Friday and Saturday nights.\n\nBut with this trip, of course, I will not be able to babysit. My sister was joking about this one day and recently my parents have been asking a lot about my trip and what about my niece. I was confused and asked them to elaborate. Apparently, 2 years old is an important time in a child's life and they said that she wouldn't remember me when I got home. They want me to shorten my (non-refundable) trip and come home earlier so I don't miss out on any milestones.\n\nI told them that I couldn't and that was final. Now they have been amping up the guilt. They have also gotten my grandparents involved. The only support I have is my brother (30M) who also never sees my niece except for special occasions.\n\nThey are also bringing up my recent layoff and my financial state. I don't want to brag but for a 27-year-old, I have a high enough savings account that I could live for a year and never work (I've been laid off a lot so savings was a priority). I could still travel and do everything I want. I have no loans, no current apartment now, and have all the big things paid for.\n\nBut despite my knowing I am fine, they are starting to scare me and guilt trip me into staying. Tonight it all blew over, my sister called me an a-hole in front of my family since I won't be able to babysit. What is she supposed to do on the weekends?\n\nI yelled at her and told her to \"finally, hire a babysitter.\" My parents are on her side and told me that \"you should help out more.\" I yelled at all of them that it was not my responsibility to parent the child. They could live for a few weeks without their free babysitter. I then left. My brother texted me later that they are still angry and disagreed with my choice to continue my trip.\n\nAITA for choosing my trip over my niece?\n\nEdit: A lot of people have asked, I will be gone for just under 4 months. I will be traveling around Europe with a short trip to visit a friend in South Korea and coming home. I suppose that that would be more than just a few weeks lol!

My kid goes for months at a time without seeing some people and definitely still remembered their faces at 2 years old. They're grasping at straws to try and force you to stay. NTA.", "NTA.  Working out childcare is the responsibility of the parents, and you are not a third parent.  Their desire to dump that responsibility onto you doesn\u2019t actually imbue them with the power or moral authority to do so.  You\u2019ve also given them more than ample advance notice that you\u2019ll be unavailable.  So this is thoroughly not your problem.  \n\nBut frankly, the whole \u201cyour niece needs you/will forget you\u201d stuff really just a pretense for them trying to get you to cancel your trip.  Don\u2019t take the bait.  A 27 year old, independent adult doesn\u2019t need to ask for permission or justify their expenditures or travel plans to anyone, yet they\u2019re acting like you\u2019re required to do both, like you\u2019re a child.  \n\nAlso, based on how differently they treat you and your brother, I\u2019m picking up selfish, sexist, \u201cI\u2019m entitled to control women and use them to perform free household and emotional labor for me, such as free childcare on demand\u201d type vibes.  \n\nAnd no, you aren\u2019t a child that needs to gain approval or justify yourself to make travel plans or spend your own money.  So stop asking them for it.  Stop entertaining discussions that frame your life decisions as if they\u2019re questions or things to be decided by committee (\u201cI\u2019d like to do XYZ, and here\u2019s my reasons why, and are you ok with it?), and shift the mentality to declarative statements, like \u201chere\u2019s what I\u2019ve decided to do.\u201d  \n\nFeel free to employ phrases like \u201cI hear your concerns, but this is my decision to make, and my decision is final.\u201d  Or \u201cI appreciate your concern, but my finances aren\u2019t up for discussion.\u201d  Or \u201cno, I\u2019m not available to babysit during that time.\u201d  And if thru ask why, you calmly and politely repeat yourself, ad nauseam, \u201cBecause I\u2019m not available.\u201d  \n\nAnd you want to and should remain calm during these discussions, because remember, you\u2019re not a kid, and they don\u2019t have the power to veto your decisions.  They can not agree with them, sure, but they have no power or authority to actually stop you.  Or to even demand that their opinions be considered.  And the more calm confidence you project when saying something like \u201cI hear your concerns, but this is my decision to make, and my decision is final,\u201d the more weight the words will carry.  \n\nAs for combatting the sexist vibes, it\u2019s pretty much the same deal.  Just because THEY might have sexist (and incorrect) opinions about your gender somehow entitling them to control over you or to free labor, doesn\u2019t mean YOU have to agree love by them or go along with it.  And the same calm, polite, confident energy goes a long way here, too.  \u201cYou know, I\u2019m feeling a bit taken advantage of and under appreciated.  Even literal nanny\u2019s, which I\u2019m *not*, get time off for vacations.  I think it\u2019s time we reset expectations, so I\u2019m no longer babysitting anymore.  Not for at least 6 months (or ever again? Or whatever).\u201d  \n\nAnd note, setting boundaries for yourself, which is what this mostly is, is hard work.  Especially at first.  People who were used to and/or benefited from you not having boundaries with them generally react pretty poorly when you change up that status quo to establish them.  They won\u2019t see it for what it is, your correcting an imbalance in the relationship, but rather as them losing something (which wasn\u2019t theirs and shouldn\u2019t have been seen as being there\u2019s) or getting screwed.  But they\u2019re not, you\u2019re just standing up for yourself so you can get unscrewed.  \n\nSo hang there as you go through this.

I would have a sit down conversation with her and let her know right away that you are going on your trip, that is not up for discussion. HOWEVER, you understand her concern for you and ask her if there is something you can do to make her more comfortable. Depending on your situation that might include - a text at a certain time (daily, weekly, etc.), emails, maybe you agree to stay out of certain countries, only stay at hotels, give her your itinerary and let her know if it changes. Honestly, all of these might sound a little overkill, but I promise you, putting your Mother's heart at ease is worth it. It also is a great safety feature. The truth is, travelling alone can be risky.

If anything, it\u2019s good to do a long trip when she\u2019s younger because she won\u2019t be too bothered when she doesn\u2019t see you - my nieces and nephews guilt me a lot more when I leave now that they\u2019re older lol. But either way, definitely don\u2019t let your niece stop you from doing this incredible trip. I just studied abroad in London, and I promise you don\u2019t want to miss this", "NTA! You are NOT responsible for other people\u2019s children! Enjoy your vacation!", "NTA \n\n\n\nEnjoy", "NTA - God your only away for what, 16 weeks? Nothing is going to happen in that time. She\u2019s just pissed that the free babysitting is gone. \n\nI\u2019d suggest going and then when you get back, don\u2019t let it fall back into old ways. Make sure your weekends are busy, volunteer, whatever you like. It\u2019s not as though they even asked you, you just kind of fell into it.", "NTA.  Go and have a great time!!!!!    Do NOT let your parents or sister get to you. When you get back only babysit if you want too.  When you don't say better find a nanny. and talk about the trip and go on and on how wonderful it was.    \n\nMy biggest regret was letting my Narc mother control me for too long.  Go live and enjoy!!!!", "Hahahaha. Mom of four here. The 2 year old won\u2019t forget you.", "Lmao, they are full of shit.  My nephew was born the January before I went off to college and I nannied him the whole summer before as in, he was almost my own child during that. I didn't come home a ton during college, but boy did he remember me.  Your whole family are ahs and tell your brother that it doesn't matter what any of them think of your choice to continue your trip.  You're a fucking adult and it's not your responsibility to watch your niece. NTA", "NTA\n\nDo not yield to the guilt trip. The beauty of being child free is that you get to choose exactly how you want to spend your time. How your parents and sister feel as if you bare some responsibility just because THEY want you too. Your sister is going to have to do what plenty of other mothers do. Sacrifice their freedom to watch their kid. Can\u2019t participate in extra events friends enjoy. \nThis sounds very golden child vs scapegoat child scenario. Guess your parents will have to help their daughter. \nAnd honestly I wouldn\u2019t even contact them when abroad. Set a new tone about your availability or lack therof", "NTA i live hours from my family and only see them on holidays. so i see my nephew in July (his birthday) and then not again until november for thanksgiving. he\u2019s also 2, and remembers me just fine and i have a lot less contact than you do with your niece. they\u2019re upset their free babysitter is up and exploring while they can\u2019t do \u201cdate night\u201d (they can, they just don\u2019t have free childcare anymore)\nwhen you get back, don\u2019t babysit anymore. and when they ask why, tell them that guilting you into not going on a trip you\u2019ve paid for put a damper on you wanting to watch your niece. hell, i\u2019m petty and i would tell them right now when you return they can expect no more free babysitting since they decided to turn against you for living your own life.", "NTA. As a parent that is fortunate enough to have enthusiastic family members willingly taking care of our baby for us to  do something not baby friendly, that time is great and it is incredibly easy to get used to having it, it helps our mental health and with catching up on chores. However no one,not even paid babysitters, is obligated to prioritise the existence of that baby-free time over their own agenda. Everyone is entitled to have some recreational time and no one signed an oath  to look after other people's kids.  It's entitled and selfish to not acknowledge or respect that. They chose to have kids, not you.", "NTA", "NTA and when you get back don't go straight back to babysitting. Or ask to be paid to babysit since babysitting will cut into your job searching time. Money up front so she doesn't back out of paying you. Ask why your brother can't babysit. Have the same level of interaction with your niece that your brother does. Or just go NC with the family that sided with your sister, maybe send stuff via another family member for niece since shes innocent in all of this.", "NTA. You're the aunt not the parent, why do you need to be present for milestones?! I mean yay for the baby but I don't understand what that has to do with you?! Why can't your parents babysit since they're so vocal?! You don't have children, you can come and go as you please.

You are a grown woman who can choose whatever she wants to do. If you want to leave for a year then go. The child is 2yo and will not remember anything. She would probably be more excited about the post cards and gifts you send back to her.

And you're a 27 year old adult who doesn't have to answer to anyone but yourself. You were doing your sister a favor by helping out with your niece. Your family is however the a-holes for taking advantage of your kindness. It sounds like you need to learn to make boundaries and make your family abide by them. It is actually a necessary skill to have when traveling too or be taken advantage of by strangers who will pick up on your inability to simply say no and mean it.

Sure, they may be worried about that stuff, but all of those are reasons in their head they can get you to not go, and you \"missing milestones\" for your niece is just the newest one.

So that excuse by them is just that, an excuse.  Are you sound like you really love your niece a lot. A suggestion that I did which went down really well with my nieces and nephews.

We actually don't even tell them how they should babysit (I mean basics yes but they can decide what they want to play and eat- our only rule is whoever gives our son to much sugar has to take care of him the next night (just a joke but that is all we say)) because we know that it is a gift and if we want our child raised in a special way we need to do it ourselves and not expect others to do it.
