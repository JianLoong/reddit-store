I worked remote so it's easy to pick up and go and this is my first time doing it. I was laid off recently but since I have a lot of money saved and the trip has already been paid for, I've decided to go for a sabbatical. For months, I have had to convince my parents, grandparents, and siblings that I am going to safe places, that I have enough money, and that they don't need to worry. I finally had them in a good spot. I leave in about 2 weeks.\n\nRecently though, things have changed. I normally end up taking care of my niece (2F) for my sister (32F) at least once a week. My sister goes to work 3 days a week and works 2 days from home, and her husband (39M) works from home but has to stay near his computer at all times since he works in customer service. On the weekends, they enjoy going out to things like hockey games, dinner, etc. I normally take care of my niece during those times. It tends to work out because they will go out on Sunday so I will have my Friday and Saturday nights.\n\nBut with this trip, of course, I will not be able to babysit. My sister was joking about this one day and recently my parents have been asking a lot about my trip and what about my niece. I was confused and asked them to elaborate. Apparently, 2 years old is an important time in a child's life and they said that she wouldn't remember me when I got home. They want me to shorten my (non-refundable) trip and come home earlier so I don't miss out on any milestones.\n\nI told them that I couldn't and that was final. Now they have been amping up the guilt. They have also gotten my grandparents involved. The only support I have is my brother (30M) who also never sees my niece except for special occasions.\n\nThey are also bringing up my recent layoff and my financial state. I don't want to brag but for a 27-year-old, I have a high enough savings account that I could live for a year and never work (I've been laid off a lot so savings was a priority). I could still travel and do everything I want. I have no loans, no current apartment now, and have all the big things paid for.\n\nBut despite my knowing I am fine, they are starting to scare me and guilt trip me into staying. Tonight it all blew over, my sister called me an a-hole in front of my family since I won't be able to babysit. What is she supposed to do on the weekends?\n\nI yelled at her and told her to \"finally, hire a babysitter.\" My parents are on her side and told me that \"you should help out more.\" I yelled at all of them that it was not my responsibility to parent the child. They could live for a few weeks without their free babysitter. I then left. My brother texted me later that they are still angry and disagreed with my choice to continue my trip.\n\nAITA for choosing my trip over my niece?\n\nEdit: A lot of people have asked, I will be gone for just under 4 months. I will be traveling around Europe with a short trip to visit a friend in South Korea and coming home. I suppose that that would be more than just a few weeks lol!

My kid goes for months at a time without seeing some people and definitely still remembered their faces at 2 years old. They're grasping at straws to try and force you to stay. NTA.", "NTA.  Working out childcare is the responsibility of the parents, and you are not a third parent.  Their desire to dump that responsibility onto you doesn\u2019t actually imbue them with the power or moral authority to do so.  You\u2019ve also given them more than ample advance notice that you\u2019ll be unavailable.  So this is thoroughly not your problem.  \n\nBut frankly, the whole \u201cyour niece needs you/will forget you\u201d stuff really just a pretense for them trying to get you to cancel your trip.  Don\u2019t take the bait.  A 27 year old, independent adult doesn\u2019t need to ask for permission or justify their expenditures or travel plans to anyone, yet they\u2019re acting like you\u2019re required to do both, like you\u2019re a child.  \n\nAlso, based on how differently they treat you and your brother, I\u2019m picking up selfish, sexist, \u201cI\u2019m entitled to control women and use them to perform free household and emotional labor for me, such as free childcare on demand\u201d type vibes.  \n\nAnd no, you aren\u2019t a child that needs to gain approval or justify yourself to make travel plans or spend your own money.  So stop asking them for it.  Stop entertaining discussions that frame your life decisions as if they\u2019re questions or things to be decided by committee (\u201cI\u2019d like to do XYZ, and here\u2019s my reasons why, and are you ok with it?), and shift the mentality to declarative statements, like \u201chere\u2019s what I\u2019ve decided to do.\u201d  \n\nFeel free to employ phrases like \u201cI hear your concerns, but this is my decision to make, and my decision is final.\u201d  Or \u201cI appreciate your concern, but my finances aren\u2019t up for discussion.\u201d  Or \u201cno, I\u2019m not available to babysit during that time.\u201d  And if thru ask why, you calmly and politely repeat yourself, ad nauseam, \u201cBecause I\u2019m not available.\u201d  \n\nAnd you want to and should remain calm during these discussions, because remember, you\u2019re not a kid, and they don\u2019t have the power to veto your decisions.  They can not agree with them, sure, but they have no power or authority to actually stop you.  Or to even demand that their opinions be considered.  And the more calm confidence you project when saying something like \u201cI hear your concerns, but this is my decision to make, and my decision is final,\u201d the more weight the words will carry.  \n\nAs for combatting the sexist vibes, it\u2019s pretty much the same deal.  Just because THEY might have sexist (and incorrect) opinions about your gender somehow entitling them to control over you or to free labor, doesn\u2019t mean YOU have to agree love by them or go along with it.  And the same calm, polite, confident energy goes a long way here, too.  \u201cYou know, I\u2019m feeling a bit taken advantage of and under appreciated.  Even literal nanny\u2019s, which I\u2019m *not*, get time off for vacations.  I think it\u2019s time we reset expectations, so I\u2019m no longer babysitting anymore.  Not for at least 6 months (or ever again? Or whatever).\u201d  \n\nAnd note, setting boundaries for yourself, which is what this mostly is, is hard work.  Especially at first.  People who were used to and/or benefited from you not having boundaries with them generally react pretty poorly when you change up that status quo to establish them.  They won\u2019t see it for what it is, your correcting an imbalance in the relationship, but rather as them losing something (which wasn\u2019t theirs and shouldn\u2019t have been seen as being there\u2019s) or getting screwed.  But they\u2019re not, you\u2019re just standing up for yourself so you can get unscrewed.  \n\nSo hang there as you go through this.

The whole 2-year-old thing is an excuse. Any cred you lost with the kid can easily be gained back. \n3. If they threaten to stop talking to you or cut you off, they are bluffing.
