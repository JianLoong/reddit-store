I worked remote so it's easy to pick up and go and this is my first time doing it. I was laid off recently but since I have a lot of money saved and the trip has already been paid for, I've decided to go for a sabbatical. For months, I have had to convince my parents, grandparents, and siblings that I am going to safe places, that I have enough money, and that they don't need to worry. I finally had them in a good spot. I leave in about 2 weeks.\n\nRecently though, things have changed. I normally end up taking care of my niece (2F) for my sister (32F) at least once a week. My sister goes to work 3 days a week and works 2 days from home, and her husband (39M) works from home but has to stay near his computer at all times since he works in customer service. On the weekends, they enjoy going out to things like hockey games, dinner, etc. I normally take care of my niece during those times. It tends to work out because they will go out on Sunday so I will have my Friday and Saturday nights.\n\nBut with this trip, of course, I will not be able to babysit. My sister was joking about this one day and recently my parents have been asking a lot about my trip and what about my niece. I was confused and asked them to elaborate. Apparently, 2 years old is an important time in a child's life and they said that she wouldn't remember me when I got home. They want me to shorten my (non-refundable) trip and come home earlier so I don't miss out on any milestones.\n\nI told them that I couldn't and that was final. Now they have been amping up the guilt. They have also gotten my grandparents involved. The only support I have is my brother (30M) who also never sees my niece except for special occasions.\n\nThey are also bringing up my recent layoff and my financial state. I don't want to brag but for a 27-year-old, I have a high enough savings account that I could live for a year and never work (I've been laid off a lot so savings was a priority). I could still travel and do everything I want. I have no loans, no current apartment now, and have all the big things paid for.\n\nBut despite my knowing I am fine, they are starting to scare me and guilt trip me into staying. Tonight it all blew over, my sister called me an a-hole in front of my family since I won't be able to babysit. What is she supposed to do on the weekends?\n\nI yelled at her and told her to \"finally, hire a babysitter.\" My parents are on her side and told me that \"you should help out more.\" I yelled at all of them that it was not my responsibility to parent the child. They could live for a few weeks without their free babysitter. I then left. My brother texted me later that they are still angry and disagreed with my choice to continue my trip.\n\nAITA for choosing my trip over my niece?", "created_utc": 1677652463, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ewk7u/aita_for_choosing_a_trip_over_babysitting_my_niece/", "score": 89, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

We can\u2019t afford a baby sitter so my grandma, Aunt or Step mom occasionally will watch my oldest for me while her daddy and I go out to do something together as a couple (23f and 21m got pregnant with oldest at 18 and 17 respectively). \n\nOccasionally one will cancel for whatever reason and low and behold we also cancel and get on with our lives. They\u2019re doing it for free and so are you. We as parents chose to have/ keep our kid(s) and since we\u2019re not paying you for your time, we\u2019re not entitled to it. \n\nThey got far too used to being able to go out whenever they wanted. They could be like me and my man and only get to go out once every 2-3 months which is about to stop for 6+ months until baby is older. \n\nAlso, 2 is a prime time in memory making sure but so is 18 months. My kid knows my sister and she was/is a very hands off aunt since my daughter was 7 months old and she\u2019s recognized her consistently since she was under 2. Your niece spends so much time with you that she\u2019s very unlikely to forget you.", "You really need to draw a line and stop babysitting period. The audacity of these people is.. astounding.

You didn't have a kid. Oh no they won't be able to play every Sunday without paying a babysitter. Truly their lives are over.\n\nPlease enjoy your (non-refundable!!) trip. And when you come back, no more babysitting for assholes. You now do yoga on Sundays. NTA. They need to get the entitlement out of their heads now or it will be an endless fight. \n\nWhy doesn't your brother get asked to babysit?", "Have a nice trip.

Definitely don't let them have any of your details like confirmation numbers.  If they know any details already, call and ask to put password on your reservations.  When you're on travel, please use your Do not Disturb function on your phone to keep their calls and messages from taking your attention away from your vacation.
