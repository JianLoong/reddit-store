I worked remote so it's easy to pick up and go and this is my first time doing it. I was laid off recently but since I have a lot of money saved and the trip has already been paid for, I've decided to go for a sabbatical. For months, I have had to convince my parents, grandparents, and siblings that I am going to safe places, that I have enough money, and that they don't need to worry. I finally had them in a good spot. I leave in about 2 weeks.\n\nRecently though, things have changed. I normally end up taking care of my niece (2F) for my sister (32F) at least once a week. My sister goes to work 3 days a week and works 2 days from home, and her husband (39M) works from home but has to stay near his computer at all times since he works in customer service. On the weekends, they enjoy going out to things like hockey games, dinner, etc. I normally take care of my niece during those times. It tends to work out because they will go out on Sunday so I will have my Friday and Saturday nights.\n\nBut with this trip, of course, I will not be able to babysit. My sister was joking about this one day and recently my parents have been asking a lot about my trip and what about my niece. I was confused and asked them to elaborate. Apparently, 2 years old is an important time in a child's life and they said that she wouldn't remember me when I got home. They want me to shorten my (non-refundable) trip and come home earlier so I don't miss out on any milestones.\n\nI told them that I couldn't and that was final. Now they have been amping up the guilt. They have also gotten my grandparents involved. The only support I have is my brother (30M) who also never sees my niece except for special occasions.\n\nThey are also bringing up my recent layoff and my financial state. I don't want to brag but for a 27-year-old, I have a high enough savings account that I could live for a year and never work (I've been laid off a lot so savings was a priority). I could still travel and do everything I want. I have no loans, no current apartment now, and have all the big things paid for.\n\nBut despite my knowing I am fine, they are starting to scare me and guilt trip me into staying. Tonight it all blew over, my sister called me an a-hole in front of my family since I won't be able to babysit. What is she supposed to do on the weekends?\n\nI yelled at her and told her to \"finally, hire a babysitter.\" My parents are on her side and told me that \"you should help out more.\" I yelled at all of them that it was not my responsibility to parent the child. They could live for a few weeks without their free babysitter. I then left. My brother texted me later that they are still angry and disagreed with my choice to continue my trip.\n\nAITA for choosing my trip over my niece?", "created_utc": 1677652463, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ewk7u/aita_for_choosing_a_trip_over_babysitting_my_niece/", "score": 38, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You didn\u2019t birth the child.. you simply extended your helping hand toward your sister who has absolutely abused the goodwill of you babysitting. Go LC and get on the plane!

Don\u2019t feel guilty and don\u2019t stay, otherwise you\u2019ll regret not taking your trip. And your sister should be looking after her own kid on the weekend or maybe your parents should be if everyone is so concerned with babysitting. Enjoy your trip xx", "NTA. Not your kid! \n\nSounds like plenty of other people around to babysit so they should do it! \n\nOr heaven forbid your sister and husband doesn\u2019t go out one weekend.  We didn\u2019t have family nearby and didn\u2019t get much time out when our kids were young and we are fine.  They can suck it up for a few weeks.   \n\nAgain, not your kid.  I wouldn\u2019t even babysit for them again when you get back unless you are paid!

Broke my heart. First time I came back it took him a few days before he was 100% comfortable with me again. And a day the second time.

You're an auntie but it doesn't mean you're a free childminder. They had the kid, not you. As for your parents- they can step up and help for a few weekends if it bothers them so much.\n\nAlso the child won't \"forget\" you. Thats full on manipulation there. Acting like they can't call or facetime when the child is around.", "Ugh. You are babysitting your niece on Sundays, when both parents are free. You not being available cuts into their fun time, not their working time. Honestly, even if you were babysitting for them during their working hours, you'd still be NTA for going on a trip. Time to completely stop babysitting, if they are so ungrateful.", "NTA, with this attitude, i wouldn\u2019t want to provide free babysitting services even if i weren\u2019t going on a long trip.", "NTA \n\nOmg.

You're 27. Act like it. They have no right to your time, or to make your life decisions for you.\n\nIt's not your kid. You do not owe them free babysitting. In fact, if they're entitled AHs about it, just stop--regardless of the trip.\n\nINFO: Do you live with them? Not pay rent? Unless that's true, I don't see any reason for them to be this involved in your decisions. Even if it is true, you are an adult and get to make your own decisions, but it would be within their rights to toss your grown ass out.", "NTA - their kid isn't your responsibility. It really is that simple.\n\nI get it. Your sister's world revolves around the kid and, to some extent, so it does for your parents, but that doesn't mean it should for you.\n\nI also get the impression your sister is a bit jealous of the freedom you have, and you going on the trip is inhibiting some of hers.

We can\u2019t afford a baby sitter so my grandma, Aunt or Step mom occasionally will watch my oldest for me while her daddy and I go out to do something together as a couple (23f and 21m got pregnant with oldest at 18 and 17 respectively). \n\nOccasionally one will cancel for whatever reason and low and behold we also cancel and get on with our lives. They\u2019re doing it for free and so are you. We as parents chose to have/ keep our kid(s) and since we\u2019re not paying you for your time, we\u2019re not entitled to it. \n\nThey got far too used to being able to go out whenever they wanted. They could be like me and my man and only get to go out once every 2-3 months which is about to stop for 6+ months until baby is older. \n\nAlso, 2 is a prime time in memory making sure but so is 18 months. My kid knows my sister and she was/is a very hands off aunt since my daughter was 7 months old and she\u2019s recognized her consistently since she was under 2. Your niece spends so much time with you that she\u2019s very unlikely to forget you.", "You really need to draw a line and stop babysitting period. The audacity of these people is.. astounding.

You didn't have a kid. Oh no they won't be able to play every Sunday without paying a babysitter. Truly their lives are over.\n\nPlease enjoy your (non-refundable!!) trip. And when you come back, no more babysitting for assholes. You now do yoga on Sundays. NTA. They need to get the entitlement out of their heads now or it will be an endless fight. \n\nWhy doesn't your brother get asked to babysit?", "Have a nice trip.

It's entitlement and possibly some jealousy. Your niece, after all, is NOT your responsibility.

Take it, enjoy every minute of it, have fun, make memories, and don't you dare let them guilt you into anything less. \nSafe travels!", "When someone doesn't appreciate the free labour, you provide for them, stop providing it. \n\nHave a great trip and make sure to have weekend plans every weekend, when you get home! \n\nNTA.
