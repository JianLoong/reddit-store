I worked remote so it's easy to pick up and go and this is my first time doing it. I was laid off recently but since I have a lot of money saved and the trip has already been paid for, I've decided to go for a sabbatical. For months, I have had to convince my parents, grandparents, and siblings that I am going to safe places, that I have enough money, and that they don't need to worry. I finally had them in a good spot. I leave in about 2 weeks.\n\nRecently though, things have changed. I normally end up taking care of my niece (2F) for my sister (32F) at least once a week. My sister goes to work 3 days a week and works 2 days from home, and her husband (39M) works from home but has to stay near his computer at all times since he works in customer service. On the weekends, they enjoy going out to things like hockey games, dinner, etc. I normally take care of my niece during those times. It tends to work out because they will go out on Sunday so I will have my Friday and Saturday nights.\n\nBut with this trip, of course, I will not be able to babysit. My sister was joking about this one day and recently my parents have been asking a lot about my trip and what about my niece. I was confused and asked them to elaborate. Apparently, 2 years old is an important time in a child's life and they said that she wouldn't remember me when I got home. They want me to shorten my (non-refundable) trip and come home earlier so I don't miss out on any milestones.\n\nI told them that I couldn't and that was final. Now they have been amping up the guilt. They have also gotten my grandparents involved. The only support I have is my brother (30M) who also never sees my niece except for special occasions.\n\nThey are also bringing up my recent layoff and my financial state. I don't want to brag but for a 27-year-old, I have a high enough savings account that I could live for a year and never work (I've been laid off a lot so savings was a priority). I could still travel and do everything I want. I have no loans, no current apartment now, and have all the big things paid for.\n\nBut despite my knowing I am fine, they are starting to scare me and guilt trip me into staying.

What is she supposed to do on the weekends?\n\nI yelled at her and told her to \"finally, hire a babysitter.\" My parents are on her side and told me that \"you should help out more.\" I yelled at all of them that it was not my responsibility to parent the child.

My kid goes for months at a time without seeing some people and definitely still remembered their faces at 2 years old. They're grasping at straws to try and force you to stay. NTA.", "NTA.  Working out childcare is the responsibility of the parents, and you are not a third parent.  Their desire to dump that responsibility onto you doesn\u2019t actually imbue them with the power or moral authority to do so.  You\u2019ve also given them more than ample advance notice that you\u2019ll be unavailable.  So this is thoroughly not your problem.  \n\nBut frankly, the whole \u201cyour niece needs you/will forget you\u201d stuff really just a pretense for them trying to get you to cancel your trip.  Don\u2019t take the bait.  A 27 year old, independent adult doesn\u2019t need to ask for permission or justify their expenditures or travel plans to anyone, yet they\u2019re acting like you\u2019re required to do both, like you\u2019re a child.  \n\nAlso, based on how differently they treat you and your brother, I\u2019m picking up selfish, sexist, \u201cI\u2019m entitled to control women and use them to perform free household and emotional labor for me, such as free childcare on demand\u201d type vibes.  \n\nAnd no, you aren\u2019t a child that needs to gain approval or justify yourself to make travel plans or spend your own money.  So stop asking them for it.  Stop entertaining discussions that frame your life decisions as if they\u2019re questions or things to be decided by committee (\u201cI\u2019d like to do XYZ, and here\u2019s my reasons why, and are you ok with it?), and shift the mentality to declarative statements, like \u201chere\u2019s what I\u2019ve decided to do.\u201d  \n\nFeel free to employ phrases like \u201cI hear your concerns, but this is my decision to make, and my decision is final.\u201d  Or \u201cI appreciate your concern, but my finances aren\u2019t up for discussion.\u201d  Or \u201cno, I\u2019m not available to babysit during that time.\u201d  And if thru ask why, you calmly and politely repeat yourself, ad nauseam, \u201cBecause I\u2019m not available.\u201d  \n\nAnd you want to and should remain calm during these discussions, because remember, you\u2019re not a kid, and they don\u2019t have the power to veto your decisions.  They can not agree with them, sure, but they have no power or authority to actually stop you.  Or to even demand that their opinions be considered.  And the more calm confidence you project when saying something like \u201cI hear your concerns, but this is my decision to make, and my decision is final,\u201d the more weight the words will carry.  \n\nAs for combatting the sexist vibes, it\u2019s pretty much the same deal.  Just because THEY might have sexist (and incorrect) opinions about your gender somehow entitling them to control over you or to free labor, doesn\u2019t mean YOU have to agree love by them or go along with it.  And the same calm, polite, confident energy goes a long way here, too.  \u201cYou know, I\u2019m feeling a bit taken advantage of and under appreciated.  Even literal nanny\u2019s, which I\u2019m *not*, get time off for vacations.  I think it\u2019s time we reset expectations, so I\u2019m no longer babysitting anymore.  Not for at least 6 months (or ever again? Or whatever).\u201d  \n\nAnd note, setting boundaries for yourself, which is what this mostly is, is hard work.  Especially at first.  People who were used to and/or benefited from you not having boundaries with them generally react pretty poorly when you change up that status quo to establish them.  They won\u2019t see it for what it is, your correcting an imbalance in the relationship, but rather as them losing something (which wasn\u2019t theirs and shouldn\u2019t have been seen as being there\u2019s) or getting screwed.  But they\u2019re not, you\u2019re just standing up for yourself so you can get unscrewed.  \n\nSo hang there as you go through this.

It is no small deal to consistently sacrifice your sundays for a child you didn't choose to birth!\n\nNTA.", "I would never babysit for her ungrateful a*s again and honestly I would reconsider how \u201cclose\u201dyou are with your family seems to me you are being held back from experiencing life because they want you around for their convenience of baby sitting of whatever else they have going on. \nBlock everyone go enjoy your trip contemplate if you want to be at your families beck and call for the rest of your life.. maybe it\u2019s time to move away.. far away since you\u2019ve been laid off and look for other employment", "NTA Do NOT shorten this trip.  This is what many people (like me) wished they would have done when they were young.\n\nYou know, people have taken care of their kids without outside help for many, many years. Your sis and BIL will figure it out.\n\nHow long will you be gone?", "NTA, they are using your niece as an excuse to control you.\n\nI believe your niece will remember you.  When my daughter was just under a year old I went on a work trip for a week.  One thing that I used to do to amuse her was spin the ceiling fan.  When I got back, the second I got in the door the first thing she did was point to that fan and I knew she remembered.", "Your parents want you to stay because they don\u2019t have to do everything you\u2019re doing for your niece. Your sister is just a user.", "NTA. If you don't rely on these people for anything just straight up tell them you couldn't care less how they'll manage when they badger you in person. Google a number for a babysitting agency and make that your only reply to any further digital communication about it. Alternate between the two until they get the message.", "NTA. Enjoy your trip! I really loved the \u201cshe won\u2019t remember you\u201d part. Smh my niece is 10 months old and I don\u2019t see her regularly. I believe she knows or can recognize who I am because I look just like her mom (my sister).", "\u201cWhat about you niece?\u201d. Exactly, she\u2019s your niece and not your daughter, so she\u2019s not your responsibility. You have no obligation and they\u2019re trying to manipulate you. NTA", "NTA. You've paid for your nonrefundable trip and are going.\n\nYour life is about what you want, not about accommodating your sisters needs", "If not LC, cut down on the babysitting, like once in a couple of months if you feel generous. And there's no need at all for family permission to go away on holiday either.", "What milestones are going to be missed over the course of a few weeks? Through the whole of the story I thought the way her family was acting like that because OP was going to become a global nomad for two years. A FEW WEEKS!\n\nGo, enjoy your travels OP, stop babysitting even when you get home. See your niece at social family events.", "Their lack of planning for your trip is NOT your responsibility. And if it wasn't obvious, neither is their kid.\n\nGo on your trip. Enjoy yourself. When you get home, look for a job. If they want a babysitter, and only if you're willing, charge them. Never babysit for free again - excepting of course for emergencies. Mind, emergencies, and not lack of planning. \n\nNTA", "Last time i was out whithout kids was... Almost 7 years ago\ud83d\ude4a... Couldn't get even the vacation days from previous years... \n\nEven if i could use a babysitter, most of the days we just want to relax at home, watch a whole movie and sleep \ud83d\ude06. (i have family but it's the other way around)\n\nEdit to add \n\nLive your life, enjoy your trip, OP! \n\nNTA (don't babysit for them, they're ungrateful!)", "Thank you, I was looking for this!  OP they are manipulating you, your niece isn\u2019t going to forget you lol!  Go have a great time on your trip, you\u2019ve earned it (literally and figuratively)!  \n\nNTA", "People are like this because they don't want the inconvenience of having to provide childcare themselves or be a parent themselves.", "I agree, there probably is a bit of jealousy there...", "Especially at 2. There\u2019s not going to be huge milestones missed. It\u2019s not like a newborn.", "Okay, but as soon you return, find your own place.\nAnd cut the babysitting they are not seeing this for what it's,  a FAVOR. They think you are obligated."]}
