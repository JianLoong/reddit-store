Even when it used to irritate me how often I had to correct people, I never got rude about it. I just corrected them and moved on.

Also, she is a new hire... newbies are supposed to be on their best behaviours and if this is her \"best\" behaviour, I dread to think what a nightmare she will be going forward.", "NTA", "NTA what a not nice word that starts with a C and rhymes with punt.", "NTA. Clearly she has some issues to talk to you like that after an innocent mistake. I mean, I imagine she deals with people making that mistake often, but no reason to go off on you like that.", "How dare you assume my name! God i hate people.\n\nNTA", "NTA and with her attitude I would address her simply as Coworker and not use her name at all.", "Sarah Cooke sounds like she's really Sarah Kooky.  \n\n\nShe's coming in wayyyyy too hot, especially in the workplace. \n\nNTA", "Sarah Cooke did a hell of a mic drop \ud83d\ude02", "NTA.  \"Sarah C\" seems fitting.", "NTA - report the incident to HR and move on with your life. She was unnecessarily hostile.", "I can count on one hand the number of times my last name has been pronounced correctly. It doesn\u2019t look how it\u2019s said. You know what I don\u2019t do? Get annoyed when people pronounce it how it looks because it\u2019s an easy mistake. Sarah C needs to get over herself.", "I've got a traditional Dutch name but live in Australia. I can't remember the last time anyone said it correctly. Shit I get it wrong myself if I've had a few beers. I just can't imagine getting angry about it. I really enjoy all the weird names people use to try and fill in the blank, I don't bother correcting people anymore, just roll along letting everyone call me different names. Can make it a challenge to grab the right coffee from a cafe in the morning though.", "I wonder if rather than Sarah Cooke it something like Saracuk, one word that sounds like 2 names.", "Yeah, I'll be looking for her name in Malicious Compliance \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "I agree with this. If she\u2019s this rude over a simple misunderstanding, her behavior will only worsen. I can also see her continuing to be hostile towards OP and twisting this incident to make it seem like OP started the feud.", "I\u2019d say that\u2019s probably why she was so upset about it.", "This should be top comment. \n\nLike, I get both sides. But OP randomly shortened it when everyone else in the office is using the long form. A simple \u201cHey, everyone in the office calls you Sarah Cooke when talking about you. Is that your preferred name?\u201d But OP also didn\u2019t mention how all of the other Sarahs in the office are distinguished, which I think is also important.", "I think it\u2019s mostly a Southern US thing", "Jesus, if she's so easily offended minimize all contact.", "As per our previous conversation i \"have keep your name out of my mouth\" so dub thee bitchface the annoying, if you would like me to use you're actual name you have 30 seconds to inform me. by the way you may refer to me as the \"lord all things, greatest that every lived, best at all things, put-ter of bitchface the annoying in her place.\" refusal to use my prefered name will be considered harassement and use of any other name will be assumed to refering to someone else and be ignored.", "Hope it's the last \ud83d\ude2c", "If she said her name was just Sarah, then everyone will start calling her \"just Sarah\" and she'll still get offended.", "So I have a name that is pronounced a couple different ways and people ROUTINELY pronounce it wrong and I have a lot of fun not correcting them now adays (in my 30s)\n\nI had a good thing going with a co-worker for several weeks til my sister had to go and ruin it.", "I have a pretty damn common first and last name, with a unisex first name and a common guy's name as my last name. Despite my full name being in my email signature, people call me by my last name a lot. I don't even say anything unless someone does it over and over and then it's a gentle \"hey, FYI...\"\n\n\nOPs co-worker is unhinged.", "A \"family name\" as in: \"we're too ignorant to know how to hyphenate a surname\"?", "What's her ethnicity? Could the name actually be like Sarakuk?\n\nEither way, NTA, just curious.", "Malicious C as OP will try and call it.", "OMG! Awesome!", "*gasps* You don\u2019t mean\u2026\u2026\u2026Dolores Umbridge, do you?", "Yeah, but we in the south don't usually have a last name as part of a double first name. Lol...", "This.. but I also want to know if it's supposed to be pronounced cookE. With an emphasize on the e like cookie... either way op nta but I would steer very far away from someone who sounds so hostile", "Yeah, but it's usually something like \"Anna Jane\" or \"Cora Lee.\"  Cook(e) is exclusively a surname in my experience.", "I have no idea", "This explains it\u2026https://youtu.be/gGUvJ9m6DIU", "Then maybe she shouldn't be rude as hell when people don't get it right, when she hasn't even introduced herself to them.", "Great, understandable! No need for her to be a dick about it - correct once and move on.", "Thats funny!", "Sounds like Cooke was mother's maiden name and was tacked on to the first. They may not have had any males to carry on the family name. No excuse for her behavior but also just an assumption.", "So apparently she told people it was like her great grandmothers name or something.", "She is white.", "Eh...sounds like it might be an offshoot of the old  'firstborn son has his mom's maiden name as his first name' tradition.  (It's why I have an uncle with my maiden name as his first name).   Possibly Cooke is mom's maiden name, there were no sons, so it became daughter's second name.", "Um, yeah we do, quite often.", "Correcting once never works. And I don\u2019t even have an uncommon/difficult/double name. I correct people a dozen times before I get irritated by it. It doesn\u2019t help. People DO NOT CARE. I literally have to go by a one syllable nickname at this point because no one can bother to learn to pronounce mine. Again, a common and easy name. Just 3 syllables. It has an alternate pronunciation and people always choose that, even if they don\u2019t know my spelling. No matter the fact that I actually have met almost no others with that pronunciation.", "Sounds like great-great-grandma was salty about losing all her rights as a human being when she married great-great-grandpa not-Cooke and stuck the next generation (and apparently all generations henceforth) of girls with a terrible name. Too bad great-great-grandma gave birth to great grandma during the great hyphen famine of aught eight", "Honestly, a white woman saying \"keep my name out of your mouth\" is really going the extra mile to be an asshole. Ignore her.", "Exactly!  I get do tired of saying my name is X, pronounced like that not whatever you are saying.", "A good friend's husband has mispronounced my name for 15 years. He's heard it said many many times. He even speaks the language that my unusual name comes from.\n\n...and it's fine. He's nice, I like him, who cares.", "Of course correcting once works. If you don't know what someone's name is and make a mistake, the person can say \"that is not my name, my name is this, please address me by this\". It's not a question of pronunciation of the name but the actual name itself.\n\nOP did not know this person's name is not just Sarah, and it doesn't sound like they have a problem calling them Sarah Cooke IF THEY KNOW that's her name. Ms. Sarah Cooke, though, decides to unprofessionally blast OP and ruin any chance of a professional relationship. It's a terrible way to go through your career.\n\nI get it, I am a foreigner overseas working in my second language and get my name mispronounced all the time. Being aggro towards someone who genuinely not know your name is not the solution here."]}
