Still, our responsibility.", "NTA but your behavior is extremely immature. You could have easily put the cannabis candy away.

That\u2019s the most responsible thing to do if you can\u2019t keep all your candy gummies in one safe space. You could get a small lockbox or safe to keep the candy and gummies in so your room is safe.

How did I not read the post when I respond saying that room should have been locked or the candy safely stored before the cousins even got there?
