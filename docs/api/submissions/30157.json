It stung a bit, but I reminded myself I was never really for that marriage. Fast forward to two weeks ago when Eve calls asking for cheque for furniture, I asked her to remind me what the amount was, I knew ruff figure but not down to a final euro.

She pulled a bait and switch and then tripled the amount of money.  That\u2019s awful.", "NTA. She might have chosen you as her maid of honor only because she knew you had money (cool custom though, not necessarily for the MOH who has to pay but for the newlyweds :D). And then she pulled the 2 MOH thing just so she doesn't loose the furniture privilege. It was very nice of you to still offer to pay even after she chose the other person over you but tripling the price was completely out of line. I think you showed a lot of grace to her and she just wanted to profit off of you. You reap what you sow, I'm guessing your friendship kinda ends here though.

It\u2019s literally putting a price tag on friendship - if the maid of honour doesn\u2019t earn much, then everyone else is limited? This would mean lots of people do what Eva tried - invite the richest person to be maid of honour ONLY for the gifts!  \n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve had to learn this way that your friendship isn\u2019t valued as much as your wallet is.", "Seems to me you are only MoH cuz you have money.

I also think gifts should be freely given and gratefully received no matter what they are, and it seems weirdly transactional to rescind a gift because you don't get a certain role that you want in a wedding.

They wouldn\u2019t have tried to scam you by switching up your role and yet still expecting a grand gift. \n\nAn acquaintance usually isn\u2019t so blatantly greedy but some will try to get as much from people as they can.
