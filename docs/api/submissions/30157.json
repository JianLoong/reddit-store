I\u2019m glad you kept the email and realized she tried to play you. I wouldn\u2019t even be her friend anymore after this.", "NTA\n\nShe isn't your friend. You made a promise based on her good faith. She wasn't acting in good faith so the promise is void. She was using you. I would never speak to her again.", "NTA. Sounds like she's the kind of person that deserves her fianc\u00e9; you didn't like him based on what she said, but since she's a bad person that tried to exploit your bank account after dumping you, they probably deserve each other. I'd send them a card and congratulate them on finding someone so fitting for the other.", "NTA AT all!!!! The only AH is her for clearly using you for your money, and then further taking the P by choosing someone else and also still expecting you to be the one to buy this stuff. It doesn't matter how much you earn, to assume you can afford it and so will pay, is wrong!! Nope, and tbh, I wouldn't want to continue a friendship with someone like this. You deserve better.", "What small Eastern European Conservative country uses cheques?!", "NTA. Sounds like she never actually intended on you being the MOH. She just told you that to get a big gift because she knew you could afford it. And then she went and switched to someone else after you still agreed to pay. She is absolutely using you. You aren\u2019t her MOH anymore, do not buy her furniture. Her new MOH Julia has that responsibility now, as custom dictates.\n\nETA- given that you don\u2019t support the marriage in the first place I wouldn\u2019t even go to the wedding if I were you, especially after she tried to trick you into buying her a huge gift", "NTA - While cool with it your friend showed there true colours. They knew your cultural customs and tried to use you as a cash cow and cut you out of the wedding.   Your friend  i would cut off completely at this juncture.", "Nta", "NTA.  She is not your friend", "NTA \n\nAny obligation (actual or just in your heart) ended when the friendship ended.\n\nThe friendship ended when she tried to steal from you.\n\nIf you still feel like you wish to send her something, I suppose you could send a couple of pieces that need to be assembled. Remove the instructions and perhaps a screw or two before sending.", "NTA - I'd see if I could buy her a one-slice toaster for her cheek. She's not worthy of two slices.", "NTA. She is not a friend.", "She is not your friend anymore. Maybe it is because she told her fiance about your misgivings about him or maybe she just didn't like you not being super excited over him. But she replaced you as MOH, lied to you abiut the cost if the furniture and when caught, was greedy, insulting and unapologetic about the attempt. You are right to save your time and money, because you were never going to hear from her again, once she got that money. You're NTA, but she obviously is.", "That\u2019s not a friend, that\u2019s a scammer. Block her and move on to better things", "NTA. She gave you the old Serbian switcheroo \ud83d\ude02", "NTA. Is this person even your friend? She expects you to pay more than everyone but doesn't place you in the same esteem.", "NTA\n\nWow. She basically tried to rob you after she insulted you.", "NTA. I'm sorry to tell you, but it doesn't sound like she's really your friend. She's not treating you as a friend, that's for sure. Now might be a good time to look back at her behaviours over the past couple of years and decide if she's really a friend, or a fair weather friend that will keep letting you down.", "NTA - She sounds like a real piece of work.", "NTA, she was using you. Who buys a place where the mortgage is so large you cannot furnish it? People who live beyond their means.", "She tries to cheat you and calls you an asshole? Wow. She's...amazing. NTA", "Your gift was first offered as maid of honor. She then chose someone else to fill that roll. Your offer was no longer valid at that point. \n\nBut the real sticking point is that she tried to scam you and get more than was agreed upon. She is a bad friend. \n\nNTA", "Why should you have written a check? I would have had her put it on a registry so I could see what I was paying for.", "Yeah. I sounds like OP was chosen to be MOH simply because of her large bank account.\n\nAnd it's a really weird tradition to have the MOH buy the couple a very expensive gift that sets the tone for what others are expected to give. Everyone has their own unique financial situation and shouldn't have to gift based on what someone else gives.\n\nEdited to add: OP should send her a toaster.", "he picked Julia because you said you'd still pay for the furniture.  She should have been thrilled.  But no, greed gets the best of her and she tries to take advantage of you.  it's one thing if she requested 25% more due to inflation but 3x?  She thought she'd get away with it.  I'm surprised you're even attending the wedding and still consider her a friend\n\nShould anyone start blasting you for not honoring the agreement, let it be known what she tried to do and a friend doesn't do that to another friend\n\nNTA", "<<first lie is never the last lie.>>\n\nfirst KNOWN lie...", "Assuming OP caught her in the first lie...", "Sadly pointing out that the \"first\" lie isn't often the first either. It's just the first one you caught her in. I've had friends lie to me for years, and find out down the road that there was a whole string of deceit. When people show their true colors, let them", "[removed]", "Exactly, rescind the whole offer OP. NTA. You're not an atm or a door mat!", "I have a Russian friend and I heard this in her voice \ud83d\ude02", "Idk about other religions, but growing up in the Catholic church most people did choose the Godfathers to their children based on who was the richest person they knew.", "Nah, Julia and Eva colluded to first get OP to agree to be maid of honor, and then agree to buying her furniture - she's got money hehehheh.  THEN it flips so that Julia can be maid of honor and they still get OP to buy furniture.  My guess is also that they'd tell everyone Eva bought the furniture.\n\nMy take anyway.", "I would've said, \"OK, let me know when Julia buys you a much bigger gift than my (3x originally planned) gift, and I'll pay up.\"", "She only asked OP for the money, she never had any intention of OP actually act as MOH.", "Nah, decline, and because it would be rude not to send a gift, send them a  subscription to Architectural Digest. \n\nWoah, the audacity of some people! \n\nNTA!", "Oh thats so interesting, thanks for that!", "I've never seen that. It's usually family.", "That must be a regional or cultural thing. I\u2019m Catholic and have never heard of that- in my circle it\u2019s usually a sibling or close friend, and money doesn\u2019t come into it.", "I was thinking the same thing. Wanted Julia to be the maid of honor but wanted the $$$ from OP. Really sad and hope we're wrong, but that's really what it looks like from this POV.", "How did Julia become a part of the scheme?", "Godparents are usually also the ones who agree to take the kid if something catastrophic happens to the parents. So you'd obviously want someone with the means to take care of your kid. You may think your constantly broke and between jobs cousin is a great person, but that's not someone you'd want caring for your kid in a worst case scenario.", "And how rich is that family member usually? \ud83d\ude2c", "OP, Julia and Eva were really good friends.  The 3 Musketeers.  OP moved, she and she and Julia have a falling out and simply don't communicate any longer.  Julia and Eva, who still live near each other still maintain a close relationship. \n\nDo you find it suspect that Eva asked OP to be her MOH, even though she lives a distance away, asks her to furnish her new home, because MONEY.  After agreeing on what furniture Julia wants, OP says yep without really blinking an eye.  A bit further down the road with no warning, Eve is now the MOH and Julia triples the amount she wants OP to give.  Just seems odd to me.", "Godparents are supposed to make sure the kid receives an appropriate religious education. That's why they're called godparents.", "Completely ordinary incomes.", "It varies depending on location. What you described is the original intention of godparents and is still likely the main connotation in a lot of places, but where I am it's very much taken on the connotation of what the other user said. Now legally it's a different story since being named a godparent doesn't actually help you become a legal guardian if anything does happen, but that doesn't change the fact that's what the large majority of people where I am thinks it means.", "Idk some people will still see those who have ordinary incomes as \u201crich\u201d if that person seems to have more than others around.", "Some people see those who save for the specific things they want and are careful with their money as \"rich\""]}
