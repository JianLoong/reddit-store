Someone who didn't do anything to you, but you reacted to them like they'd wronged you or you were deathly bored to talk to them.\n\nIf you're going to act like a toddler, don't go to the party. If you're going to go to the party, be civil. Grownups can also handle their partner talking to other people for a couple of hours, which is what you are also supposed to do.", "INFO\n\nAny complaints about the food, while you're at it?", "YTA. 1. You need a constant escort for family? Weird. 2. In 2 hours you didn't bother to introduce yourself? 3. How did you think rolling your eyes would be perceived? You sound immature and insecure. Talk to your husband in private.", "YTA, it wasn\u2019t just your husband you were rolling your eyes at - it was his *family* as well. You rolled your eyes a two new people you were being introduced to and you insulted *them* and you *did* insult the family by doing so. \n\nDon\u2019t drag other people into your disagreements with your husband. You had the choice of pulling your husband aside and talking to him, or opening up to your SIL - but you didn\u2019t. You sat an stewed and let yourself build up your resentment and by doing so, you were completely rude to two innocent people who didn\u2019t deserve your childish antics.", "INFO:  Do you always expect your husband to pay full attention to you?", "YTA. Dinner parties are for mingling and getting to know new people. Why weren't you engaging other guests that you didn't know up to that point? And if you did don't you think you may have reacted differently to meeting a family friend? It's always rude to roll your eyes. It is something kids and teenagers do, but adults talk about things privately rather than expressing private emotions publicly in a place like a party. It's just good manners.", "You're not the center of the world at all times, honey. Sorry to break it to you. If it was the uncle's dinner party, it was not *your* dinner party. \n\nYour resentful attitude definitely showed. Who rolls their eyes when meeting *anyone* for the first time? How old are you? That's something a prepubescent kid does. You *do* lack manners. Unless they were insulting you and you have a valid reason to dislike them all, there was no reason for you to act this way. \n\nYTA.", "YTA. The old family friend didn't do anything to offend you. That is very childish behavior for a grown up woman.", "YTA\nWhy did you roll your eyes anyway? You are his wife. He wasn't wrong to introduce you that way. How could you think it's justified to be so rude? If I just met someone and they rolled their eyes, I'd think they were rolling their eyes at me and I'd avoid them.", "YTA \n\nIt was rude", "Actually you sound a bit exhausting. Is there some reason your husband has to be attached to your hip 24/7? You can't introduce yourself and talk to new people?\n\nAlso, rolling your eyes at being introduced to someone? Are you 12?", "YTA....if you weren't going to have \"fun\" why go and bring everyone down?   Maybe what you thought was being ignored was you removing yourself from any conversation because in your words \" it wasn\u2019t going to be fun..\"", "INFO: What's the deal with the uncle? I'm really curious about that. Why does your husband act differently around the uncle? And why was your rudeness considered even worse because it happened in front of the uncle?", "Info : I need to know. How and why does your husband act differently around his uncle ?", "YTA This was a family dinner party. It\u2019s not about you. You should expect that your husband will spend his time interacting with his family members.  To say that you knew it wasn\u2019t going to be fun for you, makes you sound incredibly entitled. You don\u2019t need to be the the center of attention. Also saying that your husband is different around his uncle is ridiculous. I\u2019m different around my family as well. Rolling your eyes to show how mad you are because you chose not to engage in any of the conversations around you is AH behavior. If people noticed how rude you were, it\u2019s because you\u2019re rude. Not because they\u2019re dramatic.", "YTA. this whole thing is weird. what do you mean your husband changes around his uncle? changes how? also, your husband took you to his family party, and were mad when he left to go talk to his family? are you 5? you could\u2019ve been annoyed with him but rolling your eyes after being called his wife IN FRONT OF his family is immature. if this kind of behavior goes deeper and is normal for your husband, then that needs to be stated.", "YTA - being mad at your husband isn\u2019t a reason to be rude to a family friend. It must have been pretty bad for his sister to notice and comment on your behaviour.", "YTA you sound such hard work in this. You don't sound riddled with anxiety or unable to leave, no one was holding you against your will. Spouses don't typically stay joined at the hip and people typically mingle at parties rather than only talking to people they already know.", "INFO what do you mean by 'practically ignored me\"?  Was he mingling with others and only speaking to you occasionally for those two hours? Or did he not say a word to you even when you tried to speak with him?", "So when he does include you what's the first thing you did? Oh that's right, rolled your eyes. Pretty sure i'd leave you sitting by yourself at all functions if that's the way you act... YTA", "So just to be clear, the way you introduced yourself to someone was by rolling your eyes at them because your husband wasn\u2019t giving you enough attention? If that\u2019s the case, YTA.\n\nIf what you meant was that you are below the age of 8 and your father wasn\u2019t giving you enough attention, then I guess E S H.\n\nRegardless of how well you write for a child, I have to assume the latter based on your entire attitude.", "ESH. You're not an AH for being mad at your husband ignoring you all evening. But you are an AH for rolling your eyes when he introduced you to a guest. It's not the guest's fault. You could've expressed your anger at your husband at a more opportune time and in a way that your guests wouldn't be in the middle of it. Your husband sucks too for ignoring you all evening.", "ESH\n\nYou\u2019re an adult, take out your anger on your husband. Also, he shouldn\u2019t have been so disrespectful and ignored you.\n\nWithout more context it is hard to know how many people were at this event and if he felt like he needed to cater to them but face value says you all need to learn.", "ESH\n\nSeems like a childish thing to do. It might not be a big deal now, but those little micro-asshole moments can eventually add up.\n\nHe shouldn't have left you alone, you need to grow up.", "YTA. That's a reaction a petulant 15 year old would have not a fully grown woman. Sounds like your husband is socializing at the dinner party. Maybe idk do the same. You can talk to other people not just him. Or stop going and let him enjoy an evening out with family and friends.", "YTA. You were in a social setting and you apparently signalled boredom or displeasure or contempt so strongly that at least 3 people caught your meaning. Grown ups deal with boring parties without making a show of how much you dislike it.", "YTA. Grow up.", "ESH so much fun reprimanding women. Cheap thrills.", "YTA. It was a dinner party, people were mingling and you couldn\u2019t find it in yourself to try and talk to someone else? Did you expect your husband to hold your hand the whole time? This is a serious question from someone who is a staunch introvert. I have enough people skills to handle myself properly at a dinner party. \n\nBeing annoyed with your husband doesn\u2019t give you the right to take it out on someone else. First impressions are often what we use to make decisions about who someone is or isn\u2019t, this person will forever see that eye roll when they see you.", "YTA\n\nWhy don't you just stay home, a toddler would have better manners even if they threw a tantrum than you. Your husband doesn't need to stick like glue to your side at these get togethers.\n\n At my MIL's birthday party my husband spent the whole time greeting and talking to Uncles, Aunts, Cousins etc, he joined me once when we ate then went back to meet and greet again, know what I didn't do, I didn't sit there fuming waiting to roll my eyes in annoyance because adulting isn't that hard to do.", "YTA are you such a helpless damsel that your husband has to babysit you at social events?\n\nIf it was just your husband mad at you, then possibly it would be related to the context of a broader issue \u2026 but other people present also thought you were rude.\n\nYou should be embarrassed.", "ESH, leaning towards YTA. Rolling your eyes and appearing clearly annoyed is rude, and imo you should\u2019ve addressed it with him privately afterwards. It\u2019s just the mature thing to do. \n\nHe also shouldn\u2019t have been ignoring you, but i guess I wonder exactly what that means based on how you\u2019re saying it. You\u2019re married to this man, so I\u2019m assuming you\u2019ve met his family before. I would think that in most cases he wouldn\u2019t have to babysit you, or stay directly with you the whole time for you to be around his family without it being a big deal. Also, sometimes we do things with our significant others and their families that aren\u2019t necessarily always \u201cfun for us\u201d but it\u2019s kind of part of being married. It\u2019s possible that he was truly ignoring you when you tried to address him, treating you differently, and being dismissive, in which case ESH. But if your definition of rude is just that he wasn\u2019t with you, talking to you, or giving you his full attention the whole time, then YTA", "ESH. Y'all need to treat each other better.", "ESH", "esh with maybe a slight yta. The way I see it, you have a reason to tell hubby to enjoy the evening while you stay home. if he protests, just point out that you literally do nothing and add nothing.", "Esh, you for the obvious: having an attitude and rolling your eyes at someone who didn\u2019t deserve it. HOWEVER your husband is also at fault here to a lesser degree. Look it honestly shouldn\u2019t have taken him 2 hours to introduce someone to you, or ignore you to at min check that your having fun; are you sitting by yourself on your phone vs talking with others besides your sil. BUT it is your responsibility to say you don\u2019t want to go as you don\u2019t feel like there\u2019s anything for you to do besides either talk your sil\u2019s ear off or on your phone. INFO: why didn\u2019t you stay home? If you don\u2019t like going to these events why not stay at home. From  the way this reads it\u2019s as if you want him glued at the hip mentality but I like to believe that\u2019s not the case.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
