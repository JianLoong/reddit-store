She\u2019d shown up at our door, asking if she could come eat. We both found it weird but after months of this, it became standard to have her every day after school and on the weekends. To no one\u2019s surprise, we discovered that she was not being taken care of, and was more or less the black sheep of the family. Her bio mom is far from poor and from everything I\u2019ve seen and heard her other kids(11MF, 9F, 14M, 17F, 18M) are treated like royalty.\n\nI had multiple conversations with her BM about her health, such as having to treat her for lice on multiple occasions, and the lack of clean clothes and this really only made her angry. We tried getting CPS involved, but they didn\u2019t do much and after around a year, her bio mom just told us to keep her.

The 18-year-old has discussed getting custody and adopting her. (I think it is mostly for homophobic reasons) They were not innocent in the treatment that she received while living with her BM and although they were minors, I still feel like they were old enough to know better.\n\nThe past 3 years have been the hardest of my life creating this safe and secure environment for my daughter to grow up in. We\u2019ve done therapy and it\u2019s been a learning experience for all of us, but I feel like we finally have come to a place where things are settled and she\u2019s thriving. I don\u2019t want them to come around and ruin the progress we have made.\n\nMy gf agrees and does not want the siblings around either, but a few other family members of mine and her siblings themselves, told me I am being too harsh, and that I should let them see her. To my knowledge, the mom is not involved in the decision to come back into her life and it is just the two siblings, but my daughter does not want to see them and I don\u2019t feel like she should have to because they suddenly have had a change of heart.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?", "created_utc": 1672776133, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/102ht2d/aita_for_not_letting_my_daughters_bio_sibling_see/", "score": 61, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Stick to her wishes though!", "This really is a matter for lawyers/the courts - you dont have custody of this child and keeping them from their family is putting you and your gf at risk.", "NTA, but I would strongly recommend looking to have the mother sign over parental rights to you and your GF. It's your daughter's choice not to see her siblings, but they may not be able to see it that way, and as you have no legal control, it could become an issue.\n\nIt is possible that once they got older, they could think beyond what their mother was saying and how she was treating your daughter.

But you need to lawyer up quick, because if they do, you're likely to lose her as you aren't related to her, you don't have any formal documentation of rights to her. She'll lose everything.", "> my daughter does not want to see them \n\nNTA as long as you're respecting her wishes.  IMO that's the main thing that matters.  Though you might want to look into formally adopting her before some sort of custody battle happens (I don't know for sure but the courts might favor her bio family in such a dispute).", "NTA\n\nPurely because your daughter doesn\u2019t want to see them. If she changes her mind then you should reevaluate the situation but for now you are respecting her wishes and being a parent.", "NTA, but there\u2019s something that just doesn\u2019t add up to me, I can\u2019t figure out what it is.", "You need to get paperwork on this situation. I have no judgment as I have no idea what the sibling relationship was before.", "NTA, but do get your paperwork in order, so that you can keep custody of this girl and keep protecting her!", "NTA, even if you actually don't have any right to police who sees the girl you're caring for. But you're on seriously shaky ground. They might actually quiet down on the adoption front if you let them have limited visits instead.\n\nI really hope this girl doesn't need vaccinations or regular medical care or emergency care, and you never need to enroll her in another school. You have no status to do so. Yikes.", "INFO: Why aren\u2019t you seeking legal counsel?", "I wonder if her mom gets money for her (SSI, welfare, child support etc) that she happily collects while you raise her. That may be why she hasn\u2019t moved forward with making it legal. Definitely get a lawyer involved though because she (BM) can literally knock on your door and take her back whenever she wants and ruin the hard work you\u2019ve done to get her to where she\u2019s at currently.", "Seriously? YTA.\n\nNot for providing for this clearly neglected child, but because you have NO legal custody right to keep her from her siblings.\n\nShe's not your daughter, as you haven't adopted her and are frankly on seriously shaky legal ground, imo.\n\nYou need to get a family law attorney involved immediately. It also highly questionable about CPS just telling you to \"keep her\". How have you handled things like medical care, school registration, etc without power of attorney or legal documentation?\n\nEssentially, it's borderline into kidnapping if you keep her from her actual family.", "NTA for this - if your daughter doesn't want to see them, she shouldn't have to see them. You are right to respect her wishes on it. She deserves parents who are on her side.\n\nHowever, YWB TA if you don't lawyer up **NOW**. You haven't legally adopted her, you don't have any documentation proving legal custody - so she is in an incredibly vulnerable position. Currently she is in your care only as long as the whims of her bio family allow it, and if the siblings decide to take you to court over it, you could easily lose her completely. \n\nGet a lawyer, and aim for legal custody. Maybe it will be a fight, but you may be able to get her bio mother to sign over rights, or given the 3 years of care, you may be able to bypass her entirely. Options will depend heavily on your local laws and courts. You need an experienced lawyer to get this sorted ASAP. Don't let your little girl be dragged back to her abusers.", "NTA but please look into making the adoption official. At present strictly speaking you have no legal claim and now a family member is interested in custody you need a more secure arrangement. I considered a Y T A vote for you not sorting this out earlier. \n\nDig up every little bit of correspondence from that time including CPS etc - anything that proves the birth mother agreed you should care for her and seek some legal advice.", "NTA - Because she doesn't want to see them. If she wanted to see them and you still said no I would say Y T A. But all that being said you need to legally adopt her so that there are no issues in the future.", "YTA\n\nYou have not all but adopted her or taken custody. At this point you are just watching her with permission of her legal guardians and the child has no protection against being returned to that home situation. In contrast if her older siblings or you got legal custody the child would then have legal protections.\n\n>I still feel like they were old enough to know better.\n\nThe older children CLEARLY knew something was wrong or they wouldn't be seeing custody now.
