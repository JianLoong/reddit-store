She could work to find the dog a wonderful new home -- there are plenty of organizations that help with that.  She and her husband could buy the shampoo and wipes that makes the dog's dander and fur less allergenic and keep the house clean of its fur.

You probably could have worded it differently, but at the same time in a way she's choosing a man and dog over you by him bringing a pet that you can't be around.

Also, arrange to meet in the middle? It doesn't have to be always at her house, she can take OP out for food, cinema, etc. and spend quality time away from the dog.
