You are the child in this situation, and you are a very kind human to look out for the dog that way.

She could work to find the dog a wonderful new home -- there are plenty of organizations that help with that.  She and her husband could buy the shampoo and wipes that makes the dog's dander and fur less allergenic and keep the house clean of its fur.
