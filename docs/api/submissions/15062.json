We have a good coparent relationship, i try my best to accommodate to his work schedule so he can see and take our son for the weekend, we have lunch or dinner together once a month with our son so he can talk to us about school or anything going on and so he can see his parents get along, this lunches don\u2019t take more than 30 mins tops, we don\u2019t go anywhere fancy just mcds or whatever our son wants and all thats talked about is our son and what he has going on, both of our partners are okay with that or so i thought. A few months ago my son told me he wasn\u2019t comfortable going over to his dad\u2019s house anymore, when asked why he said because of Julie, i tried to ask more but he wouldn\u2019t tell me, i told Juan what our child had said and he said he\u2019ll look into it, we had our monthly lunch last month everything went fine, we went home and then juan called me to tell me Julie is not confortable with us having lunch/dinner together, that she doesn\u2019t want me to be near him or for us to talk so often, he said to save his marriage issues he\u2019s respecting her wishes. I told him her insecurities were not my problem and he should be more worried about why our son is not confortable around her anymore, i told him im not changing whats worked for our son for 8 years because she\u2019s insecure of a pregnant lady who\u2019s married and wants nothing with her husband but a healthy coparenting relationship for their child.

I hope Julie heard it and it knocks some sense into her. But I wouldn't count on it, and your ex is a coward and you may have to accept that your son is going to lose some time with his dad because of it.

They've been married for 2 years, I presume together longer, and no issues- until now.  Now your son is uncomfortable with Julie, you're experiencing some uncomfortable with Julie, and even Juan is sounding uncomfortable with Julie like he doesn't deserve to be trusted- he has to choose between his wife and his coparenting plan/what has been working well for his child for 8 years... so what changed for Julie? Did Juan cheat on Julie?\n\nAlso, DB move to have you on speaker and not tell you you're on speaker.", "NTA.  Not harsh - truthful.  Your Ex will be a total AH if he caves into his wife's insecurities.  This arrangement has worked well for your son (congrats on a good co-parenting relationship).

You are having a monthly short lunch with your ex in a public place with your child acting as chaperone. What impropriety could possibly be happening? You and your ex broke up and he married HER. What more reassurance could she need? \n\nI think you should demand they get couples therapy or threaten to go to court to limit your ex's contact.

That kid is priority. If he is going to capitulate to her whims, change the custody arrangement so that your son doesn't have to go there anymore and begin therapy with the kid so he can cope with what's going on and how he is feeling.  Some people just aren't going to be good parents and your ex sounds like one of them.", "NTA. High five. Not something to sugar coat. But keep an eye on the kid. She's that insecure an 8-year-old is picking up on it. Your Ex needs to work his relationship with his wife. If he missed that.", "NTA. First, you were correct in everything you said.

Your son is priority not Julie. \n\nTough titties about Julie.  Sounds like a controlling woman.  \n\nGood on you to stand up for your son.  Your ex is a wimp, he should be concerned about what Julie is saying/behaving toward your son.    \n\nTalk to your son, make him comfortable so that he can open up to you and find out what else Julie has said.

But I think it's time to tell your son what is going on and ask him about Julie. Maybe look into a therapist to talk to him and see if he opens up. Tell your ex you will still go on the monthly lunch and if he wants to go it is his decision, but he will only ruin his relationship with his kid.", "NTA. That\u2019s good the phone was on speaker so that your ex\u2019s wife could hear for herself exactly what you said.

Either his son comes first or he loses his son.", "NTA, Julie needs to accept that she married a man with a son from a previous relationship and you both need to do what's best for your child, either she work on her issues or she can walk away but it's ridiculous to ask you two to be bad parents to appease her.", "NTA. Nope. And he\u2019s not thinking straight if he lets her win this one.", " NTA.

Maybe get him to a therapist, where he could open up to an outsider about what's going on.\n\nAnd reading your comments, your ex sounds like he has his own set of insecurities, he wants to change your 8 year old son's last name to placate his ego. He doesn't respect his child's own identity that much, his ego is much more important. \n\nBased on your comments, you hold all the cards here. Legally you're not obligated to make your son go to his dad's place. So I think you should talk to your son more and try to get him to talk why he doesn't want to go to their place, and don't force him to if he doesn't want to. Because something Julie is doing is making him really uncomfortable and your ex needs to deal with it with his wife. \n\nAnd DON'T change anything with the parental set up.

Thanks for the visual and Congratulations on the baby.", "Nta, that's her problem and she needs to get over it", "People who have no manners?", "Also why do you need to change his last name??\n\n  \n\n\nJust because your ex wants that, so what? Thats not his say. If he ever wants to actually be on the birth certificate he can be added without changing your sons name. There is no reason to apart from your ex's desires. And with how he is prioritising his wife over his son he doesn't deserve to give your son his last name. Fight to keep your child name what your child wants. That man can be damned.\n\n  \n\n\nDon't care what he wants you son doesn't want a different last name, it's his decision not your ex's.", "NTA but unfortunately it\u2019s not working anymore. For the arrangement to work, everyone needs to be on board. Sadly Julie is no longer on board.

She shouldn\u2019t have married a man with a son. She\u2019s trying to get rid of you and your son. Your ex seems to have decided he\u2019s going to let her.", "NTA.

Y'all ain't gotta be mortal enemies. It's best for your child to see you getting along.", "No, NTA. \n\nHaving you an speaker was an AH move on his part, and if Julie got her feelings hurt, well, good. \n\nShe is pushing a child away from his father, who is letting it happen by the way, over some petty insecurities. \n\nShe needs to grow up, and Juan needs to grow a spine.", "NTA but you don't get a say in how often your son's dad talks to you, or whether he continues to meet you for lunch once a month. If that's his decision, respect his wishes and only contact him for visitation arrangements, or emergencies. No longer discuss school issues with him or anything else that might have led to ad hoc phone calls. The dad doesn't want that level of involvement in his son's life anymore.  \n\n\nBut he still wants regular visitation and you should actively encourage that in a positive way so your son maintains a good relationship with his dad EXCEPT... for your son not wanting to go and being unwilling to tell you why... that's a huge concern that he is reluctant to say why. HUGE.  \n\n\nI suspect Julie is ticked off that your ex questioned her over what your son said and that's why she's having the hissy fit and demanding you and the ex have less contact. Or possibly she is feeling guilty and wants to restrict the chances of you and the ex discussing her with your son and finding out what has happened.", "NTA. \n1) I\u2019m not comfortable w/something like this so I wouldn\u2019t marry a man or date one with this setup. She\u2019s 2 years in, (more with dating I\u2019d assume), so wtf is her problem now?\n2) child comes before new bride.\n3) \u201cto save his relationship\u201d this is bigger than just your lunches with him. It\u2019s been 2yrs+ just fine so either he\u2019s been cheating or yelling your name in his sleep OR this woman has a problem. \n4) if there is literally nothing (ask your ask straightforwardly if he\u2019s been up to something) then tread very very carefully for your kids sake. Log every interaction and comment your child makes. Ask LOTS of questions and do NOT backdown. Think of every court case where the stepmom was fine and nice to kid in the beginning but [TW] they ended up on the news unalived after years of slow torture and abuse."]}
