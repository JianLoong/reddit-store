Despite not particularly liking all of them I had a great time. I got to spend time with my partners niece who very much adores me and it is reciprocated. \n\nYesterday my partners brother, said to the niece \u201cwould you like to stay round aunty and uncles next Saturday? The four of us?\u201d She said yes very excited. I didn\u2019t mind him saying this as it would be the four of us and it would be good for his daughter to spend some time me and my partner who, unlike the rest of the family, make a big fuss of his niece. And I do enjoy BIL\u2019s company. \n\nAs the night progressed I heard chatter of a poker night among the men and heard that my partner should check with me, whatever it was he said it is fine and I won\u2019t mind. I didn\u2019t think much of it as I assumed it was asking permission to have the night away from home which is fine. However a few hours later my partner said that it was suggested we host a poker night. I said that\u2019s fine but it\u2019s the same night niece and BIL want a sleepover so may need to rethink the date of the poker night. He said that would be the same night but not to worry as there will be other women there to help me with Arya. \n\nI\u2019m annoyed, it was clearly disguised so that I would look after the niece while the men played poker. I ask which other women were coming as it\u2019s near enough all men in the family. I\u2019m then told my FILs ex who is a vile woman and my other BILs gf would be invited and possibly even my nieces mother who has nothing to do with this family anymore. \n\nI put my foot down and said it wasn\u2019t happening. I have been told, not asked this is happening. I have been told I\u2019m expected to cook for all of them, including all the incredible picky eaters (meaning up to 4 different foods). And I will be having people I never want knowing where I live in my house. I have been expected to be in charge of the niece. And it\u2019s a poker night, I hate poker and won\u2019t play. \n\nBefore we could finish the conversation we headed to my FILs house. Who then in front of everyone starts telling me the plan for next Saturday. I stop him and say it hasn\u2019t been confirmed yet and I will need to speak to my partner when I am home before we give out details. He keeps saying \u2018it\u2019s okay, it\u2019ll just be us 10, it\u2019s okay don\u2019t cook a three course meal just some picky bits, don\u2019t worry just supply the pop and we will bring beer\u201d. I t firmly say I need to check we don\u2019t have pre-existing plans and left quickly. \n\nMy partner thinks I was rude and should just accept we have been asked to host. I said it\u2019s unfair to be made to cook, host, entertain, babysit and tolerate people I don\u2019t like when I don\u2019t even want to or was involved in the planning process. I am happy to have the niece and bil over but that is it.", "created_utc": 1681123477, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12hew9v/aita_for_not_wanting_to_host_bfs_family/", "score": 243, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He does not sound like someone who cares about you anywhere near as much as you think. \n\nIf he is like this now OP, it will only get worse if he does not start treating you like a partner should. \n\nGood luck", "NTA, if my boyfriend tried to organize me hosting a big get together for a bunch of people, where i'm cooking, entertaining, etc... without even asking me, he would be my ex boyfriend.", " I wouldn\u2019t want people in my house if I\u2019m not there. If he wants a poker night, you are not available. No kids, no stray non-poker playing guests. \nGet yourself a cooler, carry out Chinese and hang out in your bedroom for the evening.\nI wouldn\u2019t lift a finger and no stray guests.", "Nta dump your bf he's garbage", "Yep. If he\u2019s volunteered, you can be busy that day and he can deal with ALL of it. Don\u2019t do any special cleaning or cooking. Don\u2019t take your niece out that night. You didn\u2019t sign up for babysitting her by yourself. Let the poker bros take care of her.", "This is probably the smartest idea, easy way to show OP\u2019s husband just exactly how much he is asking of her.", "We have been together three years and loved together for two.", "We have now spoke since I posted it. \nI made it clear that I\u2019m not hosting based on their request, especially as my partner has been actively annoyed that they have not made the effort to come over before they suggested we host. \n\nI am happy to have older BIL round and his daughter as they are going through a hard time and it\u2019s helped that we have been around more. But for everyone else unless it is popping round I am not hosting an evening for them meaning I am not 1) getting dressed out of comfy clothes, 2) cooking, 3) adjusting what I am doing to entertain them or 4) going out of my way to get food or drinks for them. \n\nI said I am happy to host as long as it\u2019s an agreed date and we collectively agree to who is coming and cater to all needs. Meaning if a five year old is coming, we cannot do poker night, we need to find something where she is equally engaged. And I wont be cooking to cater for picky eaters, if it\u2019s diet related or someone is vegetarian/vegan then I will try my best to accommodate but I\u2019m not doing two different curries because some dislike a meat then also doing something for non curry lovers (just an example). \n\nHe recognises that it shouldn\u2019t have been sprung on me and he says he was excited that he was told that his dad wanted us to host. He understands there was people mentioned who I don\u2019t want in my property so they won\u2019t be coming. And he has told his dad we won\u2019t be able to host next weekend but we will let him know when we are free to have people round.", "If I was op I would go out with some friends. Bil can figure out babysitter for his own kid", "No idea why this double posted.", "Lol do you know where you are? Any miscommunication is met with immediate divorce.\n\nIt\u2019s no longer legitimate AITA questions, it\u2019s just a springboard for reassurance.", "I\u2019m so glad you got this worked out!", "NTA but you need to sit him down *immediately* and make him understand that you will not be voluntold to do *anything*, and if he wants a poker night, fine, but you will not be there, and you will not clean up after. You will have nothing to do with this.\n\nDepending on his reaction, you should probably rethink this relationship. He sounds controlling.", "NTA\nWTF? Absolutely not.\n\nSo, you are being assigned to be a maid for the evening while your partner plays games with a bunch of men you don\u2019t like? But don\u2019t worry bc they were so kind as to supply you with help (s/), that being a bunch of women you also don\u2019t like? Oh, and you\u2019re paying for it? Did I get all that?\n\nI would leave my partner immediately for even suggesting this.", "NTA.  My family was famous for family events turned into drunken poker games with heavy smoking around small children.  Don't even take the chance that this becomes \"a thing\" for the guys in the family.  It's probably why my Mom made my Dad move away from his siblings.  He still became an alcoholic and would get bombed after work about once a month on a friday, but they probably would have killed him sooner.  He quit drinking at about 50 when he saw ME drunk a few times at 16. His older brother died way before 70 and HIS son didn't see 50.", "NTA.  He should have talked with you before saying yes to the poker night.", "NTA what kind of 50s bullshit is this? I'd be running for the hills.", "NTA. I agree with others. Go do something fun outside the house if you can.", "Um no. You don\u2019t want a house full of randos around your stuff. Especially the ones that you don\u2019t want to even know where you live. \n\nSince partner is not on OP\u2019s side. They have to be the bad guy and deal with fallout and see if this is something they will accept in their life.", "NTA.  I agree with Sarpofun.  Let them, against your wishes, have their poker night, but I wouldn't be anywhere near it.  Let them figure out who is going to babysit.  Find something else to do and TURN OFF YOUR PHONE!", "Don't take the niece.  Sorry.  That was daddy's plan all along to have a sitter.  Make daddy responsible for his own child during poker night.", "Depends on her relationship with the niece, honestly. It would be up to OP's discretion."]}
