Not one bit", "I would have thought he rather  talk to his older brother than his mum about wanking. You were helping him. My step brother and I use to talk about sex, and girls he liked.

He\u2019s gonna jerk it no matter what you do or say just leave him alone", "NTA. Your stepmom is out of bounds.", "It's not like you taught him how to do it, or gave him orb or something, you actually gave him a health related advice that saves him from pain.

Better you, who knows what works and what's good than her. It's kinda creepy that she wants to know so much about her kid's wanking", "Absolutely not, you saved him from the burning sensation of hand sanitizer on the cock", "NTA. You just stopped a possible hospital trip. Your stepmother needs to understand this.", "NTA, that could've possibly sent him to the ER, I don't know why she's upset that you prevented that. She would've been more upset though if it did happen and he said you saw him go with the hand sanitizer.", "NTA\n\nPersonally I wouldn't have stopped there I would've gave him better advice than that tho. Like don't use food or any other random liquid either, give him alternatives and warn him not to stick his stuff in random things either. At that age someone should be telling him this kinda stuff cuz lil dudes try alot of dumb stuff. I'd also tell not to tell him mom unless it's a medical issue/ emergency, he got somebody pregnant or something else like that. She clearly doesn't have the right attitude.", "Obviously NTA. You didnt seek him out to talk about masturbation. By the time you cleared that talk with her, he would've already done it and found out the hard way.\n\nYou saved him from embarrassment and a probable trip to the ER. She's obviously uncomfy with sexuality but should still be thankful that you saved him from injury.\n\nAlso.... enmeshment much? Having that kind of conversation with your kids is fine but you dont get to control what they know or dont know about sex?? Gross.\n\nI hope it was just a gross overreaction and she apologizes.", "NTA.\n\nNo good deed goes unpunished.

Could\u2019ve ended with a trip to the er if it was real serious.\n\ni have to say idk what goes on through someone\u2019s head when they think of using sanitizer to masturbate. isn\u2019t the smell telling enough?? the smell that burns your nose off?", "I mean, the kid was about to burn his ween off. I don\u2019t personally think you\u2019re wrong because imagine if it really hurt him & he cried out. His mom would probably embarrass him more by asking and then the possibility of having to go to the hospital to explain why his ween is hurting and all that.

Stepbro made it weird", "NAH\n\nIt's good your warned your stepbrother so he didn't have to find out the hard way like others that most products don't do well in that area.\n\nIt's good your stepbrother told his mom when someone talks to him about stuff related to sex and self exploration\n\nIt's good the mom confronts people that that talk to her son about how to masturbate", "yep, be careful. Make sure you have access to your papers and a place to go.", "No mom is perfectly fine to tell people to not talk to her son on how to masturbate.\n\nI wouldn't want anyone to casually talk to my kids about the 'best' ways either, especially adults.", "I'm mortified that stepmom wants jerkoff advice cleared with her first.", "Stepbrother couldn\u2019t come with a reasonable excuse to OP, I assume his mother noticed he was nervous about something and pressured him to spit it out", "Don't call the kid a weirdo wtf. Kids don't know sh**.", "How is he a weirdo? At 13, did your parents ever see you acting nervous/anxious/embarrassed about something and just leave you alone when you say your fine or it's nothing, even tho it's an obvious lie?

The mother more then likely pressured him into talking about it", "I think it's more than ok for a kid to tell their mom when anyone talks to them about their masturbation habits.", "Probably pressured to", "Or....

Are you not a male? My man prevented his little brother from learning a very painful and potentially harmful lesson and you find it bizarre he'd pitch in with advice? Explaining to kids what is and isn't safe to do is very important, 13 year olds are gonna jack off whether you want it or not, might as well tell them how to not harm themselves, just like you tell 15 year old couples how to practice safe sex, because they are going to fuck either way, it's your job as a parent to help them not get an STD or pregnant in highschool", "Why does everyone have the reading comprehension and social awareness of a toddler and keep insulting the kid for it. Op said himself that the stepmother noticed he was acting strange and asked what happened.
