I warned him beforehand that if he wasn\u2019t home by a certain time I would lock the door so it\u2019s not like I did it out of nowhere. When he realised the door was locked he knocked a few times loudly which woke me up but I pretended I couldn\u2019t hear him and I ignored him when he said he knew I was awake and he told me to open the door. Eventually he gave up and slept in a guest room.  \n\nThis morning he was giving me the cold shoulder and he said he should remove the lock from the bedroom over this. I didn\u2019t say anything originally since I could see he was angry but then he asked me if I had something to say to him and I said no, so he told me to try saying sorry so I told him I wasn\u2019t.

But it's a lot more likely that he's an entitled AH. A lot of guys think that marriage - or any kind of committed relationship - means they own the rights to your body. Meanwhile, sleep is about as central to health as it gets. I would really recommend counseling. There's a major disconnect here, and he's not listening.\n\nMy ex used to do this. (Though in his case, it was staying up late playing video games.) Then he escalated to trying to have sex with me, and trying to tell me that since we were married, I couldn't legally say no. It didn't end well for him - I'm both a martial artist and quite aware of the marital rape laws, though I kept saying not and pushing him off and he kept escalating until I grabbed his junk, and explained I would twist it off and shove it down his throat. But it was pretty gross and awful all the same - especially where he whined incessantly because OMG, I used the word rape in bed. (Which apparently is far worse than him attempting to rape me.)", "NTA. And you all know why? Because light sleepers can't help it. You can't just change that. She told him multiple times if it's after midnight please don't wake me up. He doesn't need his teddy bear every night to sleep but she does need peace and quiet. They literally have a made up guest room as well that I'm pretty sure he can customize to his comfort level since they own the house. See I think most people are putting YTA because they're thinking of this in terms of every night, it's not, if he gets home late then just don't wake your wife up, be polite, that's it.

It is not about him wanting to sleep in his room, it is about him getting what he wants when he wants it.  He has no respect for OP at all, he doesn't care about her needs and this marriage is probably going to get worse.  People like OPs husband will play victim and be all \"she locked me out boo hoo\" but actually it's them who are the issue - it's why he follows her into the guest room, and bangs on the door of the bedroom despite being told multiple times that he is disturbing her.  It is basically his entitlement over her that is the issue here, she is just trying to set a boundary after speaking with him several times, being ignored and being left unheard and having to deal with his ongoing trampling over her wishes.  I hope OP leaves.\n\nSorry for all those that don't recognise this for what it is, but it is crystal clear to me.", "NTA bc you\u2019ve asked a few times and he\u2019s ignoring you.", "[removed]", "NTA.

And does your bedroom have an attached bathroom with a shower?\n\nI'm going with ESH, mainly because the 2 of you need to talk and work this out like adults. Because you have a spare bedroom, you guys have the flexibility to each have your own quiet space. You should make that spare bedroom either yours or his, and your current bedroom is the shared one. So on nights when he's home and you guys go to bed at the same time, you share your current bedroom. On nights you guys know he'll be late, you have separate bedrooms. \n\nIf your current bedroom has its own bathroom and he is coming home late from work, then I would suggest you make the spare room YOUR room. That way if he's still not home by the time you're ready for bed, you can sleep in your own bed without being woken up; then when he gets home from work, he can shower off the days germs and go to bed without waking you up. \nBut if he's coming home late all the time from partying or being out with friends and plans on just going right to bed without cleaning up first, then I suggest you guys make the spare bedroom HIS room. \n\nEither way, you have the space to make this a more comfortable living situation for the both of you, and it's really a very simple solution.

Setting a firm and clear boundary, then following through on specified actions IS taking responsibility. Dumping a spouse over this is an extreme reaction if this is the only issue where he doesn't respect her boundaries. There's not enough info to determine if breaking up is a reasonable response. \n\nScience shows that the average man needs 6-8 hours off sleep a night to stay physically and mentally healthy. The average woman needs 8-10 hours. Sleep delegation is serious, has lasting consequences for both physical and mental health. Especially if it's a consistent issue. And you can build a \"sleep debt\". Say you need on average 8 hours. For four days in a row you are only getting four hours of sleep. One night of ten hours of sleep isn't going to make up for not getting enough for the previous four nights. He is disrespecting her, deliberately at this point.

So her locking the door was an ATTEMPT (albeit a failed one) to set a boundary.  you cannot set boundaries with people like this.

It is a shitshow she cannot win.", "You're missing the point of this problem.

If he did something shitty and I brought it up to him for example then it was \"because I didn't bring it up properly and missed out a step\".  What was the missed out step? Accountability.\n\nSo what would that look like?   \"I know that I haven't always been the best partner, but I am upset that you called me a cnt and cheated on me\".\n\nShall I go on???\n\nIn his individual sessions with the counsellor however it was \"i'm just very worried about her, she doesn't seem herself, she seems very unwell and i'm concerned and i just want to do my best for her, but she seems to be mentally unstable - please help me to understand what I can do to better take care of her\".  \n\nI'm only now coming out of the fog of \"this was all my fault\" 7 months later.", "Exactly.", "The point is there is no right move in these situations.

No.  But if you've told someone MULTIPLE times that them coming home in the small hours is disturbing your sleep, if sleeping in the guest room results in you being followed and if you are getting pissed off with their controlling behaviour... yeah i think locking the bedroom door is fucking acceptable after multiple infractions and multiple complaints.  \n\nWould I have done it in the situation? Yes!!! Did I? yes! Do you know what happened?   He broke the door down, grabbed hold of me and threatened to hit me.  Why? Control.
