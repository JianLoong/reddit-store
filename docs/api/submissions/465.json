Did you show her around and discuss food snd sleeping space?", "What do you mean that your \"understanding\" was that she would come by and check on the dog?\n\nWhen you hire a pet sitter , you either have them live at your house with your pets or you arrange for a certain number of visits a day. I've never heard of hiring a pet sitter and telling them to swing by the house whenever. \n\nWhy was your arrangement so vague that even you can't verify what you hired her for? Either she was staying at your house or she wasn't. If she wasn't, then she shouldn't have even entered any bedrooms.\n\nNAH, but you do need to be clear on expectations before you leave.", "YTA because you are dodging legitimate questions in the comments about whether *there was a discussion about this whole arrangement* and said something about **\"4 blankets 5 pillows\"** that's just nonsense -_- Either you had the conversation (which you have not once said occured) or you *assumed* that they could read your mind, and shocker! Humans don't have that ability. \n\nFeels like you know you're in the wrong, and trying to place blame. The only thing that I really felt was off with your dog sitter was eating in the bed. Like, just seems like bad manners unless you plan on doing the laundry.", "INFO: Was she house sitting too or just stopping by during the day to take care of the dog? If she was house sitting, what sleeping arrangements did you make with her?", "NAH\n\nYou're not an ah for being bothered that she slept in your room and she's not an ah cause you never told her that she couldn't. That's something that should be communicated. Even my best friend pointed out \"hey, we set up the spare room for you\" or \"I put some blankets on the pull out couch for you when you stay over\". You don't necessarily have to outright say \"don't sleep in my bed\", but you should at the very least HINT at it. If you really don't want someone in your room, you make it clear.", "ESH. \n\nAs the employer: you are responsible for being clear in your expectations and not allow ambiguity (\"it was my understanding....\") that you'd be uncomfortable with to persist. You define what it means to do the job. \n\nOn her part: agree, pretty presumptuous to eat in your employers bedroom.", "INFO: Was she supposed to be staying at your house? and if so, did you show her a specific room she should sleep in?", "Yes, YTA for being pissed for a number of reasons.\n\nFirst, dog sitting is not the same as cat sitting; dogs need to be fed multiple times a day and need to be let out at indeterminate times to go pee / dump; they also need to be taken for walks. If the person was not \u201cliving in\u201d, they would need to be repeatedly coming over during the day.\n\nSecond, it doesn\u2019t appear that there was a \u201cclear and definitive\u201d discussion about what was and wasn\u2019t included, so in the absence of her breaking any specifically agreed provisions, you are the AH for being pissed about what was an ambiguity (her staying overnight).\n\nFinally, you don\u2019t say anything about paying her for this (you mention she \u201coffered\u201d), so if you are saving on dog kennel, her eating some of your food is not a big deal.\n\nShould she have eaten in your bed \u2026 probably not, but not a huge deal. Normally my judgement would be N.A.H. but you asked if you are an AH for being pissed, and for that, the answer is \u201cYES\u201d!", "ESH\n\nYou for not communicating clearly with the dog sitter whether this was just coming by to walk the dog, or sitting the dog and staying over all weekend. \n\nHer for bringing food and drinks to your bedroom. <- whatever the miscommunication was, this is disrespectful to someone else\u2019s living space.", "Nah. Kind of weird but doesn\u2019t sound like you discussed it either way so she took it her way and you yours. Never assume", "INFO: Did you tell her what rooms she could and couldn't use? If she was supposed to stay overnight, did you provide her with some place to sleep?", "Our dog sitter stays at our house. I run her through where everything is & let her chose between 2 guest beds. If she wants her daughter to stay she\u2019s welcome to use the other guest bedroom too. My point being, we set boundaries in advance. I didn\u2019t really want her to sleep in our bed so I told her that. No confusion. Other than that she can treat the house as her own, including using our en-suite as it has a better shower.", "YTA, of course she slept at your house to watch your dog. You can\u2019t just drop in and feed them twice a day like they were a cat. If you would have preferred she stay in a different room you should have specified, same with preferences on food in rooms, shoes indoors, etc.\n\nAlso she should have been made aware there were cameras, if not that\u2019s just creepy.", "YTA I guess because I don\u2019t know your arrangement. I\u2019ve been pet sitting for a circuit judge for almost 20 years. They have between 4-6 dogs and 4 cats. She volunteers at the humane society and brings home the hard luck cases as she has the means, space and opportunity to house them. I always sleep in her room in her bed. It\u2019s made up with fresh linens when I arrive and I make it up again fresh the day I leave. She has always thought her room is the largest, most comfortable, and has the best views (the live right on one of the Great Lakes). She doesn\u2019t want anyone else put out but her as she\u2019s the head of the household and since I keep up the pups routine and they sleep in her room it guarantees their comfort as well as not having to worry they\u2019ll get into someone else\u2019s things. Most of these are older or behavioral issue pups so they rely on routine. She pays me excellently and trusts me implicitly to hold the pets welfare at the highest regard. \n\nI\u2019m unclear if you are angry that the girl stayed in your room, stayed at all over night, or some third thing. I went with ESH because I don\u2019t know what you expected her to do while you were gone. Of note, due to the number of \u201ckids\u201d my judge has I would never just pop in, feed, etc and go home. It\u2019s unrealistic.", "YTA, for the simple fact that you refuse to answer if everything, your rules, expectations, how it's all gonna go down, had been communicated to her.\n\nYTA also for apparently expecting that it'd have been enough for the dog for someone to drop by twice a day to let it out. That's neglectful.", "NAH. this may be a communication error on both ends. she assumed she could sleep in the bed and you assumed she wouldn\u2019t do that. i dogsit on the side to make extra money outside of work and i\u2019ve had people tell me i can sleep in their bed, though i\u2019ll usually just go to the couch. she probably thought you wanted her to stay those nights and assumed sleeping in the bed was ok. clarification was needed. if you want her to dogsit again, tell her where she can sleep or if you\u2019d rather her stay at her house instead", "INFO: did you discuss details with her? What she could and couldn\u2019t do, if she was staying or just visiting, what room she could use if she was staying?", "ESH - OP certainly did not set this up with any clarity (dogsitting or housesitting--they are not the same) and the sitter was not being respectful of OP's personal space.  Even if the sitting believed she was housesitting and the main bedroom was the only place to sleep, taking food in there was NOT appropriate.", "Did you expect her to stay overnights?", "YTA dogs need company and our pet sitter always expected to stay over or come by at least twice a day, for at least 2 hours a visit. And when I pet sit, it's overnight and established they cover my food and time. I'd probably suggest NAH but communication is on you so it's your fault you weren't clear about expectations or boundaries.", "YTA. Unless you laid out specific instructions or limitations; she has done nothing wrong. You didn't say 'Not to'.  Just because it's not something 'you' would do, doesn't mean that's how other people would/wouldn't do it. If you asked her to dog sit without specific parameters, so it's totally up to her on 'how' to handle the task.

I\u2019ve always heard of dog-sitting being someone who comes and stays over, or the dog goes and stays with them. So unless you were explicit that you only wanted her to visit twice a day and wanted her to drive back and forth (and how much does gas cost in your area), I\u2019d have assumed the same thing she did.", "guess what I'm thinking about this right now...\n\nThat sounds like that's about as much as you communicated to her.

I always go over what I want from them - I show them where they can sleep and leave instructions.

For 3 reasons - 1 not actually having an agreement on what the pet sitter would do, 2 thinking a dog should be left alone for days with only a couple potty breaks and 3 for not disclosing cameras in your home to a person working there.

Just NOT in my bedroom\n\n This seems to be partially your fault though op as you clearly didn't go over your rules and dogs routine with her before you left. she should know what times to feed the dog, how often and the times you walk the pup, and any rule of don't enter X space while you're there.\n\nShe should be on the couch or a guest room, not your own personal bedroom. You two don't have an intimate relationship and she has no business being in your room for any reason except to collect the dog for a walk.\n\n  I would personally not use her services for house sitting again after that intrusion to your privacy. Maybe think about installing a locking door knob in your bedroom next time you leave town to prevent it from happening again with another sitter.", "Given the vagueness of the description by the OP of what the dogsitter was supposed to do, I would not be at all surprised if the communication with the dogsitter was just as vague.

If the person was not \u201cliving in\u201d, they would need to be repeatedly coming over during the day.\n\nFair enough, but in that case the dog sitter should've just been honest about it and say that she could only do the job if she was staying there.", "This is how you do it.

Your pet sitter deals with that stuff, too. \n\nI/They don\u2019t necessarily need to know where your cameras are, but at least do them the courtesy of letting them know they might exist - and, maybe under what circumstances you might check them. Lie if you want to. But, disclose the possibility. Example . . .\n\nOne of the dogs I just finished sitting for became ill 2 days ago. I guarantee you I got to a point where I no longer cared what I was/n\u2019t wearing when I heard her fart or hack; she\u2019s getting off the white rug now. It\u2019s only fair to let someone staying in your home know they\u2019re taking a chance of giving you a peep show. Frankly, I\u2019d have had to clean the rug - again - so look if you want. I\u2019m gonna try to get her out now. Others may feel differently. But, we should get the choice.", "And that was also my thought. If OP wasn't clear, a lot of assumptions likely occurred.
