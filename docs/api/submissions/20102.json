As long as we've known him, this friend has kept to a very strict diet, which has almost always led to us eating over at his place, but he is an excellent cook so I've never minded. We have not, however, seen him since both of our children were infants.\n\nFor dinner, we were served salmon with quinoa and arugula. My son is very mild for a 5-year-old - he throws tantrums very rarely and is the opposite of a picky eater, but I could tell from how he was acting that he was not vibing with this meal. He was picking at his plate, shuffling food, and while he did try the salmon, he didn't seem to like it. I asked him if he was happy with his dinner and he said no, he wasn't. \n\nI basically said, \"Haha, kids, right?\" and asked if there was anything else for my son to eat. My wife's friend said that his daughter just eats whatever he makes, so he doesn't keep \"kid food\" around the house. \n\nMy wife said it was fine, our son would be fine. While he is a mild kid, he definitely gets hangry and this was the beginning of our night, so we anticipated being there for an additional hour or two. I said that our son needed to eat so he'd have energy to play and apologized, saying I'd be gone for just a few minutes, picking something up for our kid. My wife's friend seemed irked, but said he'd try and keep my plate warm.\n\nI was gone for about 30 minutes, came back with a Happy Meal - ordered extra fries in case his daughter wanted any, which she was not allowed to have. By the time I was back, dinner was winding down. My son ate his meal, we had dessert, and he went off to play with his friend.\n\nIt was definitely a hiccup in the night, but things went fine. We had a good time, but my wife was definitely cold with me. When we got home (3 hours after dinner), she told me that I was an ass at dinner for no reason. I pointed out that if I hadn't gotten our son dinner, he would've been a monster the entire way home, to which she replied that we would've left earlier. I said I was just looking to solve the problem as it happened and that if her friend had been more accomodating, we wouldn't have been in the situation in the first place.\n\nShe got offended on his behalf and we decided to just go to bed because we clearly were not getting anywhere. It's been two days since, things are still stilted between us, and I'm not sure where I went wrong.\n\nAITA for leaving dinner to get my son food, even though dinner was served?", "created_utc": 1687224226, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14dwys8/aita_for_leaving_dinner_to_get_my_son_mcdonalds/", "score": 5112, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He had some bites and could\u2019ve waited 30mins for you and wife to finish the meal.", "YTA. That was really rude, especially because they had a kid and you brought an obvious \u2018treat\u2019 food into the house. If your kid is picky bring granola bars along with you or something, and if you fail to do so just handle it as it comes the way your wife suggested. If your kid was going to be a \u2018monster\u2019 you could have left early and stopped at McDonald\u2019s on the way home.\n\nAnd your kid wasn\u2019t even complaining, and there was desert coming! You way overreacted.", "YTA - you were at dinner at friends house.  you left mid dinner and went and got McDonalds?  not only that, but brought it back for their daughter to eat as well?  you cannot be this clueless.  i'm completely open minded, but if you pulled this at my house, you wouldn't be coming back.", "YTA. \n\nNo you don't get up in the middle of dinner and go get Happy Meal. Your kid could have waited until the meal was finished or as your wife said, you could have left earlier and picked up something. Also saying that the friend wasn't \"accommodating\" because they don't keep chicken nuggets and fries available for every random five year old that shows up is rude. They made dinner. That was the dinner they made. You did not indicate ahead of time that there would be food restrictions for your child so they didn't make any accommodations for that. Or that your child prefers traditional \"kid\" food. \n\nIt's okay for your kid to not enjoy a meal and to wait for an alternative.", "YTA...... that was extremely rude, and rubbed salt in it bringing fries for a kid you reasonably should know isnt allowed them. In the future you should just keep a small box of nuts, rasins, jerkey, and/or crackers in your vehicle or purse when going over there.", "Yes, it was rude. Your kid would have survived one meal that wasn't kiddified. He wasn't starving. You're kind of setting yourself up to have a spoiled kid who expects their parents to drop everything and get fast food for dinner if they don't like what has been presented. \n\nThen you bring back McDonald's for him to eat in front of their kid, but apparently, you thought that was OK because you picked up some extra fries for their kid, too. Never minding the fact that this friend keeps a strict diet, and now maybe they have to be the asshole that tells their kid \"No you can't have this crap they brought from McDonalds.\"\n\nYTA", "NTA for getting your child food, but you could\u2019ve finished dinner first.  You can\u2019t control what you don\u2019t like. Salmon and arugula are both things that I just can\u2019t. I would love to like them but nope. \n\nI don\u2019t see how they had nothing there he would eat but maybe they weren\u2019t willing to offer?  Like a cheese sandwich? A bean quesadilla? Nothing?", "NTA - Your son eating is more imortant than whether or not someone who keeps a strict diet and didn't cater to his guests instead of his own meal preferences gets offended.\n\nI'm gonna go on a limb and assume picking McDonalds was a convenience choice and it's not like you didn't consider the other child....unlike your host.\n\nCould he have waited? Sure, but why should a 5 year old have to sit and watch everyone else eat instead of you ducking off to grab him something.\n\nGood on you for priorising your child, not social etiquette.", "YTA\n\nKids are going to be picky eaters. But at the same time your son is going to be able to survive if he eats dinner a later than normal and leaving to get McDonald\u2019s in the middle of a meal at someone\u2019s house is very rude.", "Yes, YTA. It was rude. Part of having kids is dealing with them when they aren't getting their way. My 5 year old gets hangry too but we've never up and left or buy dinner after someone else made us a nice meal in their home. I assume you your friend wouldn't remember several years down the road if your five year old had a rough time (short of like breaking things or hurting the other child) but I guarantee you your friend will remember when the food they gave you was ignored so you could leave and get McDonald's.", "your kid wasn\u2019t even misbehaving.\n\nif he was, you say \u201chey kiddo, if you can tough it out and be on your best behavior, we\u2019ll get a happy meal on the way home\u201d\n\nalso, i learned to love salmon as a kid. it\u2019s still my favorite food.\n\nYTA", "I cannot stand Salmon so I have to admit I would of had issues with that dinner. I suppose I would of waited till dinner was over, visited for a respectful amount of time then scooted off to the nearest restaurant.", "YTA.  You are not teaching your son to have good manners.", "YTA- your kid wasnt going to starve, worse case scenario you could've slipped out after dinner to a grocery store and picked up some healthy snacks and left the dinner a bit earlier if needed to do a dinner at home. Parents teach their children acceptable behavior, you are teaching your child that if theyre not happy with a dinner (or whatever else) that they are number one, activities will be halted by at least one person for them and they will be catered to no matter how rude it was towards the hosts for you to up and leave for 30 minutes.", "YTA. I know it\u2019s a child but still, someone makes a meal for your family, you\u2019re expected to eat it. That\u2019s how kids learn manners and to try new things. I feel it\u2019s rude to leave to get something else to eat for your son while everyone else is eating. Also the guys daughter not being able to eat fast food and having to watch your son eat it in front of her seems rude. Poor girl is missing out on the nuggs", "As a parent, I have to say ESH - the host should have offered your kid something else if they didn\u2019t like the dinner. Don\u2019t need to make a second meal but toast or cheese and crackers, it\u2019s pretty rude to assume guests will have the same expectations for a child to go hungry if they don\u2019t like a meal. \n\nAnd really, they should have asked beforehand if the menu would work for your kid - assuming a 5 year old you don\u2019t know will eat salmon, quinoa and arugula, and having no alternatives on hand? That\u2019s being a bad host, in my book. \n\nSo yes, your kid needed to eat something, and the host should have done better on that front but, knowing your host is strict about what they eat and getting McDonalds is kind of an FU to them. You could have grabbed yogurt and crackers or granola bars from a grocery store, it didn\u2019t have to be the ultimate fast food meal targeted at kids, including a toy. And really, what parent of a small child doesn\u2019t confirm dinner will work for them and/or bring a snack they like if you don\u2019t know what\u2019s being served (especially when you know host\u2019s diet is different from yours)?\n\nYeah, you\u2019re both a couple of selfish jerks/AHs.", "NTA- I would have done the same thing, and I definitely would have been fine with any guest at my house doing it too. Adults aren't going to go hungry if the only food available they don't like. You were even nice enough to ask of they had something else.", "NTA", "NTA at all. \n\nYour wife wanted to look like what her friends would think is a \u201cgood mother\u201d when it came to nutrition. You fed your hungry child. End of story.\n\nBy the way, please always take food with you no matter where you\u2019re going (a banana, some biscuits, cut up carrots, his own dinner). Just a tip from a parent who also understands what a hangry child can do, how it impacts my own sense of peace and well being.", "I\u2019m gonna go against the grain and say NTA. First of all, who serves little kids only salmon and arugula, seriously strong tasting foods that kids are bound to be disgusted by, with no child-friendly alternatives. Even adults will refuse to eat salmon or fish in general. Some people are absolutely disgusted by fish. (I love fish but I get it).\n\nI take him to be a dad who wanted his kid to not only not act up but also be able to eat\u2026. Just like we wouldn\u2019t deprive our pets of dinner, how are you going to deprive your child? Yes it\u2019s a little bizarre to leave in the middle of dinner, but it\u2019s also pretty rude not to offer any alternatives to kids other than fish, in the entire house. I think the host brought it upon himself.", "I'm blown away by these responses. You are absolutely NTA. You as a Father prioritized your child's needs over your own social gathering. You made sure he was fed and that his needs/wants we're acknowledged. That is nothing short of commendable and I'm sure you and your son will grow up to have a very strong relationship. I'm happy to hear that you were in his corner.", "Host is a dick for assuming your kid would be cool with salmon, quinoia and aragula (ffs!) And not offering anything else. Well done to your kid for trying the salmon at least.\nI personally would not have gone to Maccas though. Maybe better to have waited until your kid cracked the shits - the evening would be ruined but at least you would be safe", "NtA congratulations for them making their kid eat what is in front of them with Zero options but thats not your case.\n\nMy kids are both under 10 and I will ask them what they wanted for breakfast, lunch and dinner most days. \nI've explained the food groups and how we can't bindge on candy or fruit only and we need to pick other food groups to stay healthy. \n\nThis method has resulted in Overdose of Grapes wich led to puking. To much sugar and junk food which had the same resulted. Did they do it again? Nope. \n\nEven with takeout my youngest loves sushi the oldest couldn't be bothered. But we also do try something new every week. That has worked out well for us so far. \nThey have been picking their outfits (weather permited) since 3 and have been going clothing shopping picking things out since 4 years old. \nI give them options because they are not my little robots I want them to have Options and be able to say no. \n\n\nMaybe one day your kid will like Salmon I didn't till I was in my late teens. They can stay mad. Also insulting *\"we don't keep kid food\"*  The F does that mean? I've met chefs who lives on T.V dinners and takeout because they didn't want to cook when they got home lmao", "I'm going with NTA as a host she didn't have to make \"kid food\" I don't expect other peoples children to eat like mine so I will make sure to have something for children just in case. I usually feed my kids before just in case and would've taken them to McDonald's after we left.", "NTA and I would have done the same thing.  I don't care if the friend got offended and your wife can shove it honestly.  I would put my sons needs over all of that in a heartbeat.", "NTA. You're just a parent doing what parents do best - getting their kids the food they actually want.", "YTA and rude. get some manners dude", "Forcing your children to eat shit they don't like is fucked up. Everyone in the comments is being absolutely delusional. Even adults don't like some foods, OP specified his son isn't normally picky and simply doesn't like salmon. I'm 23 and I HATE salmon. I've tried to eat it multiple times throughout my life a million different ways and I simply hate it. I hope none of y'all have kids. \n\n\nBefore I get jumped - again, he specified his son isn't picky and this is a one-off where his kiddo simply didn't like something.\n\nOnly reason I'll say YTA is because you could've finished the meal first and then got him food, little rude to get up in the middle.", "YTA as you KNOW your friend adheres to very strict diet issues. So you knew in advance. It might be something your son didn\u2019t like. Would\u2019ve been better to ask in advance or bring something for your son for a snack.", "YTA- It sounds like you didn\u2019t even bother to ask what was the menu. You literally left in the middle of dinner to get different meal for your child.  literally could have asked the hosts \u201c Do you have anything that my son can eat? It seems like he doesn\u2019t care for salmon.\u201d", "YTA. You could have asked ahead of time what was being served. You could have brought food in case you son didn\u2019t like what was served. You could have left earlier than planned if your son didn\u2019t eat his supper. What you absolutely should not have done was delayed supper by 30 minutes while you left to go pick up crap fast food for your kid. You say your son isn\u2019t picky but bring that McD\u2019s was your go-to makes me question that. I can hardly believe you actually think this was ok. You were incredibly rude to your hosts and your wife is right, you were an ass.", "Did you not like the meal either?  I\u2019m just guessing since how you described the food and jumping up so quick to get your son food. Did you get some McDonald\u2019s too?  Just curious. YTA", "I think the hosts were odd not to come up with an apple or something.  They aren't required to keep frozen nuggets on hand for kids, but surely there was something they could have offered.\n\nCompletely crazy to leave during dinner, though.", "Bottom line: there are two kinds of parents. Those who make \u201ckid foods\u201d for their children and those who serve the children what the adults eat. If your friends are the second type and you are the first, don\u2019t eat dinner together. NAH", "NTA. These people are weird. Your child is typically not picky, but this guy makes his five year old eat bs that most children don\u2019t find palatable. There are healthy and balanced meals for children to eat that isn\u2019t full of odd textures, smells, and looks that children aren\u2019t used to. You put your child first in a situation you didn\u2019t see was going to be good. Children get hangry all the time. I\u2019m not making my child wait to eat as I eat in front of them either. More power to you. Is this the best lesson? No. Bringing McDonald\u2019s to a household that doesn\u2019t permit it, and allowing your child to have the fun food in front of the child who is deprived of it? Maybe not your best move, but you had good intentions and that\u2019s all you can hope for. Next time, pack a snack and take it outside for him to enjoy, or have him eat it in the car on the way there.", "I have a 2 and 3 year old. Typically I make them dinner (either what we\u2019re all eating or a \u201ckid dinner\u201d) and they can eat that or have a banana.

Sometimes they choose not to eat and have a lot of breakfast in the morning \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f My husband is more likely to offer a lot of backup options. Every family (and people within the family!) are different in the way they feed their kids and that\u2019s fine. I\u2019m just saying this bc I see a lot of comments about \u201ckids can eat it or be hungry!\u201d and that\u2019s not how everyone operates and it\u2019s ignorant to assume a one size fits all approach to feeding children. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t go so far as to call you an AH, I\u2019m going to say NAH but you handled the situation with more urgency than required. You didn\u2019t need to drop everything and go get him food, if you didn\u2019t have snacks on hand you could have gotten him something after dinner or left early like your wife said. You brought emergency energy to a non emergency situation.", "NAH\nI see how that's a spoiled brat enabling move but also how that's not a kid friendly menu for most kids", "NTA I will never say that someone who gets their kids  McDonald\u2019s is a ass", "Unpopular opinion, NTA. Restricting food from your kid when you know he will be hungry and upset just so your wife and her friends will be happy is not ok. I\u2019m glad you listened to your kid and what he wanted in the moment. \n\n-someone with an eating disorder", "NTA. Honestly, you left in the middle of dinner which is a bit rude but all these butt puckered people throwing a hissy fit over leaving are weird. You did what you thought was right to keep from a child meltdown. They'll get over it and if they don't fuck'em", "NTA...I'm almost 62 and had I known it was salmon, quinoa, and arugula I DEFINITELY would have brought something more to my palate.  No offense to the hosts but that's part of the role of host...to ensure all of their guests are accommodated for.  ...you honestly mean to say they couldn't whip up a pb&j and Kraft mac and cheese?", "NTA - I don't blame your son for not wanting to eat that. This guy should've explained what kind of food he was serving beforehand so you wouldn't have had to leave to get the food. This is not normal kid food.", "NTA,\n\nsounds like your wife is upset more out of unwarranted embarrassment she feels that your 5 year old wouldn\u2019t \u201djust eat whatever he makes,\u201d as if that\u2019s a result of her/your parenting.\n\nI would have asked prior what was being made and brought back up just in case my kid tried something and didn\u2019t like it, rather than let them be hungry because our host thinks that kids should have no say in what they eat. \n\nBut if I hadn\u2019t asked prior and didn\u2019t have notice of what was being served, and was shamed with a backhanded comment like (\u201ceats whatever i eats\u201d) i would have got up and went to get my son something else, because hosts should accommodate their guests and not expect them to follow thier archaic parenting rules.\n\ni would talk to wifey and get to the root of her issue, which i really think is guilt and embarrassment and let her know that she\u2019s a great mom, and that your childs preferences are not a reflection of her parenting style.", "ESH. I wouldn\u2019t have liked that meal as a child (and I also ate whatever was put in front of me, but sometimes it was hard) and quinoa disagrees with my stomach terribly as an adult. Arugula is a really strong peppery flavor and I didn\u2019t care for fish\u2014I\u2019m still working on that as an adult (I\u2019ll eat sushi, and then salmon and tuna and some mild whitefish). It might be a hard dinner for an average five year old. Small kids taste things more strongly, and our taste buds are more dulled as adults. Some little kids eat and like everything, but for others it can take a ton of exposures and sometimes we just don\u2019t like something. Good on your kiddo for trying a little bit of it.\n\nHe could\u2019ve considered that this might be a lot of difficult foods together for the average five year old and had something around like fruit, buttered pasta, crackers and nut butter, cheese\u2026real basics that are healthy enough. You could\u2019ve brought some kind of basic backup for your kiddo like cheese sticks, crackers, nuts, apples, whatever he likes. \n\nHim not asking what the kid would like\u2014not great hosting. You and your wife not being prepared\u2014also not great. Neither of you talking about the food in advance\u2014bad communication. But I don\u2019t think leaving to get a happy meal was the best choice. Gently ask a little more about basics you know your kid will probably eat. I bet the dude had like, bread and nut butter, or fruit or something. Next time, be better prepared, and I\u2019d suggest apologizing to your wife\u2019s friend. He may have realized that just because his kid will eat it doesn\u2019t mean others will, and may apologize in turn for not communicating.", "Ps. Making kids eat x,y,z because \"tough\" is toxic parenting and will potentially impair your kid's relationship with both food and yourself.", "Going against the grain I guess, but NTA. I cannot believe the amount of people saying to just let your 5 year old starve. Truly despicable of every single person saying that. I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to sit there and eat your food while your child is starving. Sure there was precautions you could\u2019ve taken, but either way serving salmon and arugula to a child and thinking they will like it is insane to me. I hate arugula and I\u2019m 25!!! \n\nI think it\u2019s also pretty insane that the hosts didn\u2019t think about the fact that people coming may hate those foods or even be allergic! I always tell guests ahead of time OR I have extra food stored in case someone doesn\u2019t like it. Not everyone is going to have the same food palate as you and that\u2019s okay!!! \n\nA child that\u2019s fed is better than a child that\u2019s starving so again.\n\nNTA", "NTA for feeding your son. I'm autistic, and when I was an extremely food-sensitive kid, I know I wouldn't have touched it.

Was Mickey D's the best option?  Maybe, given the kid was hungry. This parent wanted to prioritize their child's need for food over the sensibilities of the host. GTFO over it. The kid is 5. \n\nMy kids were picky eaters until they were about 7. I fed them and let them set their boundaries. Now?  They're both foodies. \n\nOP, NTA", "I\u2019m going to go against the grain and say ESH. The parent sucks everyone pretty much covered that. But! As a host I always give folks a heads up as to what I will be serving. I feel like if I am inviting guests in my home I should cook something I know they will like and if their needs are something too difficult for me to manage I let them know they should bring a dish to pass that\u2019s something they will eat. I eat just about everything but salmon is a really strong taste and arugula can be bitter. That\u2019s just not something I would make for folks I hadn\u2019t dined with for quite awhile.", "NTA. I don't know why you're getting so many asshole votes. Your wife's friend sounds like kind of a dick \u2014 my dad was the same way about a 'strict diet' when I was younger and it gave me an eating disorder. Of course his daughter eats the food he makes, she's not going to get to eat otherwise.\n\nYou might have been able to prepare if you knew he was going to be a tool and make adult food for an assumably average 5 year old, but even then, who feeds a kid that young SALMON and QUINOA??\n\nThat being said: I suggest you take it upon yourself to contact the friend. Say that your wife pointed out that it was rude to leave, and say that while you do think you did the right thing to get your child food so he wouldn't be in a bad mood for the playdate, you are sorry for interrupting dinner.\n\nAfter apologizing to the friend, tell wife you apologized to him. It sounds like she took more issue with you interrupting dinner, so say you apologized for interrupting dinner and see how it came off as rude. Don't reiterate that you think you did the right thing because she'll see it as you rekindling the argument.\n\nIf the argument gets rehashed anyway:\n\n- If he hasn't seen your child since he was an infant, why would he assume an essentially random 5 year old would eat an 'adult' meal? His child is not your child. His diet is not your diet.\n\n- If you had known your son wasn't going to be adequately provided for, IE offered food that would be palatable to any random 5 year old, you would have fed him before dinner.\n\n- What were you supposed to do, make a big deal out of waiting for everyone else to eat, and THEN go get him food? To me that seems MORE rude.\n\n- Ask, genuinely, what your wife would have preferred, getting him food to eat with everyone else or him having to watch everyone else eat while his mood sours?\n\nThat being said, don't have this argument in earshot of your kid. It's not his fault, and nobody wants him to feel like it's his fault.\n\nYou are NOT the asshole! Sorry for everyone saying otherwise. Hope things settle down soon.", "ESH - you for leaving mid-meal instead of later or bringing contingency snacks; they for assuming little kids would eat arugula and quinoa and not either having a kid-friendly option OR letting you know the menu in advance so you could plan for this eventuality.\n\nThis is why we run the menu by our guests and seek their feedback.", "NTA I'm going against the grain here. You asked if there was anything else your child could eat (and unlike others going mmeeehh you just want fried foods I assumed you meant like... a sandwich, or some fruit or whatever). I have 2 small children and meals at the time they need to eat are critical to keep them functional. \"Wait a few hours and feed them later\" is NEVER an option for my kids. We'd have to leave (pretty darn quickly) and sort out feeding our kids. \n\nI'd probably not bring takeout back to the house, but leaving with my kiddo and returning after they've eaten (leaving my spouse who's friends with the host to socialise) would probably be my course of action.", "YTA!

Things we can't taste can be dealbreakers for kids.  One of the reasons for the battles over food that be think is fine is because kids can legit taste things we have lost the ability to taste ourselves -- what's fine for us may or may not actually be fine for them.\n\nThat being the case, the kid tried the food, the kid didn't like the food, and you chose not to starve your kid in the name of politeness.  THAT WAS THE RIGHT DECISION.  Your wife is far too concerned with manners here when she should be, as you were, concerned about MAKING SURE HER KID IS FED.\n\nBottom line, the happiness of your child is more important than being Miss Manners.

You did this.  Good job.  If your friend is, you know, an actual friend, they will understand what happened and why.\n\nAlso, salmon as a meal that kids are going to eat is pretty daring in the first place.  Salmon is a very finicky meat and has a very strong flavor that isn't for everyone, and can even be dangerous if cooked improperly since it's one of those meats that it isn't easy to tell when it's done visually.  Your friend may have prided himself on his cooking but he's clearly not used to cooking for a 5 year old that he can't dominate into eating what he wants them to eat.\n\n(BTW, the idea of putting a 5 year old on \"a strict diet\" is ludicrous enough to begin with, this is probably THE most important time of their lives to make sure they're fully nourished so they can do the growing they need to do!)", "NTA.

Meals that are easy and kid approved such as Tacos, Spaghetti, Burgers, Meatloaf, etc. take precedent. I'm not saying it's right, but I'm saying it happens. I don't think I was even ever fed Salmon the whole time growing up, and didn't even try it until I was in college. It's certainly not what I would expect of a typical diet of a 5 year old. Thus, it was **unreasonable to get mad at OP for getting some food for the kid, especially if there were not even any foods to snack on.**\n\nThat being said, both OP **and his wife** should have had **a reasonable expectation, based on their previous knowledge of their friend's eating habits, to ask what the planned meal for the night was and, if it was truly so far outside of their own eating habits, should have made plans to bring an additional meal item as a back up**, or to share, if the kid ended up liking the food.  If they didn't do either of those things, then that is on them. If they did, and the friend was against them bringing anything else, then that is on him.\n\nOP's wife should be more understanding of **preventing temper tantrums, which can affect driving ability by being distracting**, esepcially if she may not be the one who's driving home. Thus, being mad just because OP got their kid McDonald's is unnecessary.\n\nAnd, despite what I said earlier, I'm not sure what more OP could've done. While I know many people that would give punishments by saying that, \"If you don't like what I eat, then you don't eat\". I wouldn't want to be that cruel. To a certain extent you cannot help not liking what you don't like, and so long as you don't make a habit of it, then, in my opinion, you shouldn't be punished for it by not eating for three hours. And I say punished because, as someone with both food allergies and a fast metabolism, there have been times where I've had to completely skip meals at peoples' houses, or at work functions, because they accidentally make a meal/course that has an ingredient I cannot have. And those **three hours are absolutely long enough to feel so hungry it hurts at any age, let alone 5 years**.\n\nYes, maybe, the timing of leaving was imperfect. But, would you rather him, the 5 year old son, have a tantrum there due to his hunger and take it out on the other five year old when they play, and then force both adults, OP and his wife, to leave early?\n\nThat all being said, the **biggest mystery to me here**, and what I think everyone may have had a point on was the **timing of the leaving to get the food.**..as in, in the middle of dinner, not simply immediately after. Therefore, the million dollar questions is: **Why does OP feel so threatened by this friend of his wife's that he doesn't want to leave her alone with him, and so instead goes to get the food while they're eating together with the friend's daughter, versus doing it afterwards so that his wife and the friend are alone while the children play?**", "NTA    I think your wife was actually T A.  I agree that it would have been better to wait until after dinner to go get something for him but I think you did what was best for your son under the circumstances. Hindsight doesn\u2019t solve the problem that your kid tried the food, and didn\u2019t like it. I also find it difficult to believe that your host didn\u2019t have Anything that your child could eat - eggs, cheese, some kind of vegetable.

And instead just makes a (possibly snide) remark about not having kid food? \n\nI put the kinda E S H, because you acknowledge that the host has a strict diet that you\u2019re aware of. Sounds like you assumed just because he had a child that he no longer follows a strict diet, and you know what they say about assuming. And this oversight caused you to leave a social event while it was happening, to get your kid something to eat. I would take this as a lesson to bring some snacks with you. Just on the off chance your kid doesn\u2019t like another meal in the future, and you\u2019re again faced with a host who doesn\u2019t seem to be that accommodating. Also kinda TA because you bought HIS kid something without asking. Don\u2019t know if you offered the fries right to the daughter without checking with dad beforehand, but if you did that\u2019s an AH move too. \n\nYou knew you guys would be there for awhile yet and, assuming your kid has not had food recently because you were going for dinner, you knew they would be VERY hungry after another couple hours of socializing. Going by by lived experience for timing, dinner would have been at 5:00pm at the earliest. So even if you arrived right at 5 and dinner was served right away without any socializing beforehand, you wouldn\u2019t have been leaving till about 6:30-7:00pm ish at the earliest. But it actually sounds like you guys would have only left earlier if your son started to become \u201ca monster\u201d AKA, missing a meal, being hungry, and (being a kid) not knowing the best way to handle that. Especially since any resolutions are reliant on other people meeting his needs as he can\u2019t on his own. Heck ADULTS talk about being hangry and most of the time they actually have the ability to change it, just haven\u2019t yet.  \n\nAfter leaving you would have the travel time to home, then the time to prepare whatever meal for your kid. Don\u2019t know many 5 year olds with super late bedtimes. So now to be able to eat is also pushing back bedtime, cause less sleep makes for such a great mood the next day. And now either OP\u2019s kid goes to bed right after eating (which isn\u2019t great for digestion) or gets even LESS sleep so their tummy can settle before going to bed (most experts recommend waiting about 3 hours to go to bed). \n\nAlso wow at the people getting after you for not giving you child a wide enough palate because he doesn\u2019t like salmon\u2026 right MUST mean it wasn\u2019t introduced early enough. Because EVERYONE KNOWS the trick to liking every kind of food there is, is just to introduce it before a certain age. /s \nMy baby is 6 months old. JUST old enough to start trying solids. Guess what we found that they don\u2019t like? BANANAS!!! And yes, we have already tried multiple times like they say for introducing before deeming it \u201cdoes not like, will try again in a couple months\u201d. It was the 4th food they have ever tried! Guess I didn\u2019t introduce it early enough and I should have done it at birth. /s", "NTA. \n\nIf I am hosting, I do my best to make my guests comfortable.

It would have been more rude for the host to insist the child go hungry. In the end this was not even an issue, and definitely not something worth arguing about. \n\nSo many unnecessary rules about how/when/what should be eaten. How about the comfort of your guests being a priority. Salmon is something even some adults can\u2019t tolerate so it\u2019s an odd choice when cooking for a young child who may have never even had salmon before. If everyone relaxed, not being hungry could easily be seen as the most important outcome from a meal. Not who ate what and when to please whoever.\n\nChildren also biologically have a different sense of taste to adults. The host could have considered this.\n\nChildren are people too.

Ffs. \n\n(We do potlucks, take each other out to eat, or pitch in cash etc. What matters is we all make time for each other. I encourage my kid to do the same with her bffs.

Note: no need to announce that you're going out to buy his food because the host didn't provide \"kid-friendly\" food because that's just subtle shade on your host. No need to put the focus on your child because he's not the focus of the evening! Also, it's good for your child to not always be the focus -- that's a great way to raise a narcissist, and teach him his needs always come first. Good for him to learn that sometimes, he doesn't get things exactly as he likes them, sometimes he has to wait his turn. \n\nThe host, in my opinion, was either pretty oblivious (maybe because his own child was eating the food and so he thought it wasn't an issue with other kids?) or didn't want to accommodate the 5 year old's food preferences.

Children are picky eaters here as well. \n\nI have seen \"kids food\" in menus here, but from what I have seen is less fast food (unless you are in an actual Mc Donalds, that we do have btw and do very well). \nIts more mini sized portions from adult dishes with less frill.", "Because they\u2019re going to have to get used to not being able to eat on demand at some point. They\u2019re going to go to daycare or school and food will be served when it is served and not necessarily when they are hungry. There will be periods where they\u2019re hungry but won\u2019t have immediate access to food. Learning how to deal with these types of situations is how they become resilient, well-adjusted people.", "You think the mother hadn't thought of that too? That's why she planned to leave earlier. (Which is much less rude than what OP did, btw)", "He was fed. Salmon and quinoa are not some rare foods that kids can\u2019t or don\u2019t eat. Feed your kid normal food and they won\u2019t constantly whine for chicken nuggets and easy mac.", "Exactly this. OP I think was using his kid as proxy to complain about the food offered.", "Plus the kid did actually try the food, which many don\u2019t. He didn\u2019t throw a tantrum either, just expressed his dislike when asked about it. \n\nI think it\u2019s perfectly fair enough to say ok you don\u2019t have to eat it if you\u2019ve tried it and don\u2019t like it. \n\nLeaving in the middle of the meal isn\u2019t great. It might have been slightly better if OP finished his meal, took his son with him to grab something and came back but that\u2019s still rude. Leaving earlier and grabbing something on the way home or at home would have been the best option.", "Not liking salmon, arugula, and quinoa doesn\u2019t make the kid picky.  OP admitted his kid IS picky but that menu would find a lot of adults dissatisfied too.  Serving something like that without having provisions for alternatives isn\u2019t very hospitable.\n\n\u201cHey, come over to my place for dinner but I\u2019m going to give you something you may not like and not have anything else so your kids can get hangry.\u201d", "Or the host could check with the guests to see if any accommodations need to be made for a 5 year old, which is not at all an uncommon thing.", "Literally noone is saying the kid should have been forced to finish the meal. The  consensus is the dad was a bit of an idiot for leaving mid-meal for a MacDonalds, that's a very different conversation", "European here. Kids food are in every restaurant. Yes they are very much like fast food. Chicken nuggets, fries, sausages and more.", "Or OP refused. He sure ran out of that house fast enough to make you wonder who actually wanted the McDonald's.\n\nMy ex used to blame his son for picky eating and say that he was the reason they ate out at fast food restaurants all the time. But when I'd come over with groceries and cook he'd order delivery from the other room and say he did it before I came.\n\nI spent weeks trying to figure out what was so wrong with my cooking that he wouldn't even try it before realizing I couldn't compete with an addiction to fast food. Unless I offered him something prepackaged or frozen he wouldn't touch it.\n\nOP sounds the same.\n\nHe even brought fast food back for a child when he *knew* her dad avoided it. It's a way of tearing everyone down to his level so he doesn't have to feel bad.", "I don't think it's the food I think it's the tyrannical attitude that often accompanies it - and how late you try and instigate it. \n\nItalian kids are out here eating chunks of parmesan and olives as appetisers while American kids only eat nuggets.\n\nPermissively just feeding your kid fried, pizza and nuggets is also pretty clearly not creating a good relationship with food.", "It is other way round. It leads to healthy eating while the \"kids get unhealthy food while being taught healthy one is for adults only\" leads to unhealthy habits.", "Idk I'm flabbergasted at some of these comments. Salmon and a veggie sounds like a really tame, basic dish (quinoa a bit rarer so not many have experience eating it maybe), but I guess each culture and household is different.", "I wouldn't class myself as overly picky, but that menu would leave me picking at my plate too. I don't mind quinoa and I adore arugula (although I had to look that up because we call it rocket in the UK) but the salmon would have put me right off. I don't wander around telling people I dislike fish, although there seems to be a pretty even split between the people I know who like it and the ones who don't, anything fish related is one of those things that my parents always told me to check about when having guests for dinner.", "I used to have a friend who enabled her kid to be a super picky eater. One time she mashed up cauliflower and added a bunch of butter to disguise it as mashed potatoes so he would eat a vegetable. I am American, but I didn't do this with my kid. In fact, my kid & I still tell that story a decade later!", "Yeah look into how things got so bad. An entire generation in the US had food insecurity, and it traumatized them so badly they in turn did it to their children who responded by either doing the same thing or going too far the other way. But many, many boomers have the issue of not knowing when they are full because they had to clear their plates. A lot of them refuse to try anything new because they think they can't just have a taste so if they don't like it they have to eat it anyway. And almost all of them are either over or underweight because they never understood healthy eating.\n\nFunny how the stock market crashing almost a century ago is still causing severe issues.", "My dad was raised that way and all his siblings have food related illnesses and are obese. My father is finally getting a decent relationship with food in his 60's. It took his wife taking a class on healthy diet and how to eat when you're diabetic to get them both on track. (I took the same class but he ignored what I said because I'm his child, and was telling him that everything he's known about food his whole life was wrong. His wife was able to get the stuff through his head, and I'm grateful to her.)", "I thought the same thing. The Op wanted the mcdonalds lol more than the son. \nSo if the OP knew this was a healthy guy, and that there is a chance that his son and op might not like the food, they should have eaten mcdonalds on the way there.", "Yes, exactly. The recommendation is to not cook a separate meal. A plain alternative like bread and butter etc is ok.", "What's wrong exacly with not liking potatoes when fries are okay? That's totally valid. I love fries, I love mashed potatoes, but the bland boiled potatoes with parsley or something? Thanks but no thanks. I don't know what you want to say with the pork vs sausage/bacon? Yes sausage and bacon is also a pork so to speak, but I don't know if you noticed that the taste greatly differs. I don't have a problem with pork btw, but can imagine that others have different preferences.", "My daughter gets acidic poop when she has too much fruit, makes her really sore. Never thought I would have to limit fruit intake but I do.", "nail on the head.  \n\n\nif it wasn't so then am sure he'd have at least finished his dinner before donning his hero cape to rescue his famished son", "I wouldn't bet on that.\n\nMy dad was like this with my siblings but worse. So every day attheir house, the kids would eat something different, all from different restaurants. One mcdonalds, 1 Wendy's, and even some would get poutine or steaks picked up from a pub.\n\nThey're so spoiled that my lil bro screamed when we passed dairy Queen without getting it and parents thought we hurt him in the backseat lol it was just because he wanted ice cream, so of course we went back.\n\nI wouldn't bet on the original bet because this was all for spoiling kids, not so my dad could eat junk too. Thankfully I didn't grow up with my dad lol", "My husband's 12 year old is an insanely picky eater. It's the result of feeding him fast food and junk when he was small. Now it's like pulling teeth to get him to eat vegetables or anything that isn't fried.", "I'm in the UK was raised eating only what was given. Unfortunately my parents like bland food and I had to eat 2-3times per week something I don't like no accommodation even where it would've been easy. So while my kid mostly eats what we eat I don't go out of my  way to feed him things he doesn't like. I try to 'match up' our meals like last night we had a smoked fish curry, too spicy for a 3yo so he had salmon (entire fillet to himself!) And noodles with broccoli- he was given the choice between rice or noodles. Thursday and Friday he has meals at nursery so I save stuff he won't want for then. \n\nI think what gets lost in parenting is common sense! And some cutting corners cos sticking nuggets in the oven (or microwave I hear in the US) is definitely easier! He has pizza once a week and a ready-made stick in the microwave meal once a week so I'm not claiming to be super mum I get it but it is a choice how to feed your kid although logistically it can be tough!", "> Feeling like we need to dumb down kids food is quite an American culture thing.\n\nEasier to do with processed food, junk food I guess. Ain't nobody cooking two dinners from scratch just in case one isn't liked but if it's just chucking them in the oven then why not.\n\nWe always had one dinner but there was a get out card of a sandwich. And typically it would be a soup and a main kind of a setup so chances are you would like at least one. I sure remember some sandwiches between me and my siblings over the years but we never needed kid junk food this way.", "I think that in our own homes, we try to consider everyone who will be sitting at the table. Everybody likes different things, and everybody finds different things inedible. So I have always tried to think of each person and serve at least one thing I know they like. I imagine most people are that way.\n\nThe children have to try a bite of everything because tastes change as we age, and what they hated last week might be this week's new favorite. So, one bite.\n\nThen, if I did it right, there is at least one thing each person can eat a couple of helpings from, and not jave to choke it down.\n\nThey are children, and they have no choice about what is served, so I think that is the only logical and reasonable way to do it. Children should never be forced to choose between eating something gross (to their tastes) and going to bed hungry.\n\nI dare you to try to make me eat liver and onions. Super Gross. Why would I think it is okay to try to force anyone else to eat something they think is nasty? Why, because they are young and small and I can feel powerful with my big, intimidating, rigid self?\n\nI always served my children regular food. I don't know what \"kid food\" is for sure. But if anybody at my table, child or adult, has an aversion to whatever is served, they are welcome to some PB&J or whatever. I'm not going to pull all the pots and pans back out and cook Thanksgiving for you, but damn if I'll send you away hungry.", "Why would you force them to finish? That\u2019s a terrible thing to do to anybody."]}
