Follow those laws to the letter so no one can lay legal claim to your property.  Do not leave your financials around for someone to find.  Do not trust anyone to mail in a mortgage payment for you (same with utilities, taxes, insurance).  Do not commingle money.  Have a separate bank account for the trust that the house is in.  Seriously.  Don't let love for some guy make you financially vulnerable.  Buying a house is typically the larges financial investment you will make in your life.  Do not mix love with this kind of business.  \n\nAs a woman, I always recommend women have their own individual assets that are sole and separate from any romantic partner.

Do you live together currently?", "NTA\n\nHaving a background in mortgage & real estate - You are being very smart with this.\n\nIf you are financing a portion of the home, mortgage companies actually go off the lowest credit score, not the highest if there is more than one applicant. \n\nNo only that is if you break up down the road, yes you could afford the home on your own but in order to get his name off the mortgage, you would have to refinance which would add additional closing costs and the interest rate might be unfavorable later on. Plus you would have to pay out his share of the equity (unless you get courts involved which then you could petition the court to not pay him if you can justify it).\n\nAll of these are real messy and stressful. Keep him off anything financially until you can trust him to not go down the financial drain and bring you with him.", "You have your head on straight, mama bear. You have come a looong way, and your determination to create stability and safety for your kids is exactly the right thing. \n\nThe right kind of man would understand how and why that is so important for you and your kids, and support you in your ambition. The right kind of man would be so proud of you. \n\nBut... He is making \\*your\\* plans all about \\*him\\* and his feelings. That tells you where his priorities are. My read on this: he's feeling competitive with you (because you have a great job, financial security, a plan... and he doesn't) instead of a teammate with you. Not a good sign. \n\nDon't let this guy slow you down or get in the way. \n\nAnd--further down the road once you are settled into your place--if a great guy comes along who deserves to move in with your family, \\*absolutely\\* get rent from him, in addition to utilities/insurance/maintenance. Another adult in your household can contribute to paying your mortgage, without putting them on the loan or the deed. Don't give any guy a free ride.", "I understand where you are coming from, but I see where he is coming from. He is looking at your relationship through rose colored glasses. He sees a future with you and by saying you want this house without him, he feels your not as committed as him. \nMe and my wife had kids young 2 by the age of 19. I ran the streets while she went to school and took care of the boys. I had this same mind set. I worked for the money to by the home, why would I put her name on it? The whole commitment thing I said earlier was her response to me telling her I wouldn't put her name on my house. \nWe now own 10 rental properties after getting married and all is well. \nBy all means get your house, but maybe cut him a little slack.", "Yes yes yes!", "Cutting hours is a tactic used to get unwanted employees to quit. The customer complaint was just the opportunity they used to officially sever ties, since he wasn't shifting out the door fast enough.\n\nIf he can't keep a job, that's a big problem. He's saying that lack of understanding and compassion is preventing him from staying employed? That sounds like a person who cannot take responsibility for their own behaviors and habits. It sounds like someone who will not adapt.\n\nIt's been six months, and he's already acting entitled to *your children's* security. NTA but you need to really think about that.", "None of that is good reason to have him as coowner of the home", "> fired him because of a customer complaint, but they had been cutting his hours to almost nothing for weeks before\n\n> He isn\u2019t a lazy man\n\n> he has had an aweful time finding a job\n\nHow long have you known this guy, only about 6 months? I challenge you to consider all these statements against each other. Some people have it easy, and some people have temporary struggles. Still other people are struggling for self-inflicted reasons and will always BE struggling because of \"someone else's fault.\" My BIL is like this. Can't keep a job, can't save money, always wronged by somebody. Also can't give up his cig habit even when he can't make rent.\n\nThere are a lot of 'creative people' out there who just get bitter that they can't stumble their way into success and consider 9-5s that pay the bills beneath them. They don't want to work a day job and build their art as a hobby until they can monetize it. A lot of people don't work a job they enjoy. Enjoyment doesn't always pay the bills.\n\nMaybe he is a hard worker and in a period of struggle. Maybe his job was indeed unfairly cutting his hours vs looking for an opportunity to get rid of him because he was a problem employee. Something you should look more objectively at. Him wanting to be on the house while unmarried and unable to contribute to the mortgage is a bad look.", "You gave us all the information we need. Dude isn't even working and talking about owning a home. Do some thinking op.", "Please don't let pity overrule your common sense.\nHe's picky about jobs.\nHe's acting entitled. \nBig red flags.", "Even if he is a good man, demanding to be involved in your home purchase when you\u2019ve only been together for 6 months is a very big red flag. I can\u2019t imagine expecting someone I\u2019ve been dating for less than a year to include me in major life decisions like that, either conversationally or legally. Protect your kids and break up with him because you don\u2019t know what else he\u2019s willing to demand from you or them. He\u2019s showing you who he is right now, and that person may not be compatible with you given your situation.", "Nah, he can bounce. He\u2019s moving way too fast and wanting too much. He should want you to be independent of him so if you guys break up your kids are secure. He doesn\u2019t get that because he doesn\u2019t value you", "I think they mean boyfriend and girlfriend (bf n bf/gf n gf )   shouldn't purchase together instead married couples should.   Of course a single person can as you did", "Okay. I didn't say single people shouldn't own their own home.\n \nI meant to say, that if you're in a relationship, you don't buy a house with a partner of 6 months. It's a big committment, and your relationship also needs to have that committment. \n\nPeople have condiments in their fridge older than this relationship.", "Just want to caution that a lot of men will be super good father figure types to gain the trust and love of single moms.  In 6 months anyone can fake that, so I would make sure it plays out more before you take it as fact.  Also, I might hold on letting them get too close because it could be much harder to let go if you need to if you worry about the kids being sad at the loss.  Just speaking from personal experience.  But also, NTA!", "If he's paying utilities and not the mortgage or improvements, he shouldn't have any claim to building equity in the house (though as someone else mentioned, check the laws for living together or common law partnership implications). But from his point of view, it might also be that he can't build his own home equity if he's living with you then. I'm assuming living with you would still be way way cheaper than renting somewhere and more comfortable than living in his camper, so he can see it as an opportunity to save money until he can buy something or you can buy something else together. But definitely talk to him about what's behind his concern. It may be different views on long term commitment and values or concern about his own financial independence, rather than something sinister. And it may not really matter because 6 months in isn't much at all to be trying to financially tie yourselves together, and will you even be together by the time any of this is relevant (not saying kick the can down the road for the conversation and making sure your values are compatible, just saying I agree it's way early for him to be thinking about sharing your income and investments).\n\nRegardless, completely NTA for wanting your own stable property to pass to your kids. Make sure you do figure out how to keep it legally separate and protected no matter what your future relationship status is with him or anyone else!", "Okay if you\u2019re having trouble seeing how insane this is\u2026 let\u2019s flip the script. If you were dating someone for a short time who had 2 kids, was planning to buy a house in 2 years and you were unemployed living in a camper (even if it was \u201cshort term\u201d), would you feel entitled to their future home ???? After contributing nothing to them, their down payment, their family, dating only 6 months, etc. Nooooo way Jos\u00e9.", "Amen", "But OP has only been with this guy for 6 months and the kids are not his.  He has no investment in their future. \n\nYou sound like you wanted to be there to build a future for your family.  You worked, your wife was in school and caring the children.  You had the same goals. \n\n Such a big difference.", "Buy the house for you and your children.  You have only been dating this guy for 6 months.  Anything can happen and it will", "Don't have this guy in your life.  The balls on him to demand owning half this house (though to be fair, if your genders were flipped, half of reddit would be applauding him.)\n\nIf you're foolish enough to have someone who demands half your house just for showing up 6 months ago, tell him you'll be signing a prenup if you were to get married.  And then follow through.  You're looking for a complete asset separation, default separated, with opt-in joint status.\n\nIn some states, the house would be yours if you own it before marriage, but don't rely on that.  eg where I live, he would own half the gains, if any, during the marriage.  If you were to get married and then divorce, you would have to take out a second mortgage to buy him out.  You can also poison accounts by using commingled funds.  eg putting even $2k of your joint earnings into your $100k savings account you came into the marriage with could mean that, on divorce, he gets half.\n\nSo: tell him there will be a prenup with a complete separation of assets.  His reaction will be enlightening.\n\nAnd then if you decide to get married, to him or anyone else, engage a family law attorney 6 months beforehand to get a prenup done.", "Honestly to expect this after only 6 months is a bit audacious on his part, even moreso given the fact that he was just fired from his job.  You've worked too hard and too long to take even the smallest chance of losing it on the unpredictability of another person.  Stick to your guns and atand your ground on this.  You're doing it for you and your kids, and if he can't understand that, I would call that dealbreaker territory.  You have to prioritise yourself and kids over anything else.  If he can't deal, hand him his walking papers. In this case sooner would be better than later.", "True but like I said he is looking through rose colored glasses. Maybe he feels they will be together for ever. (6 months still in honeymoon phase). \nI told OP she should get the home in her name because that's the safe thing to do.", "I wonder if maybe he's feeling a little emasculated? He didn't make as much, now he doesn't make anything, and he feels like 'less of a man' moving into his woman's house? Not that it's a good reason and 1000% you should absolutely not do this but maybe that's it? For the record I've been with my SO for over 6 years and I'm not on his house in any legal sense and there's no reason to be. I didn't buy it and it's for him and his kids security.", "It is not likely the mortgage company would allow him as unemployed to be on the mortgage anyway.  The last house I bought, I was married and still had to have it in my name, and hubby had to sign a Quit Claim deed.  Also, I had to pay my car off, so don't let him talk you into financing any vehicles either.\n\nNTA"]}
