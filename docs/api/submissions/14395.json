What he can't do- without being TA- is harass you about financial things after 6 months of dating whilst he's still figuring out his own financial stability.\n\nI say this even though I personally am in a stage where I would probably not date want to a single parent, nor would I want to date someone who is set on living in a whole home that's not for \"us\" in a potential marriage. I would not have had that conversation the way he did.", "He would want to pay 50-50? \n\nHe can't even afford 50% of the down payment. Never buy a house with someone you are not married to or even in a long term relationship with (6 months doesn't count). \n\nBuy your own house for your children. Do not put him on the deed.\n\nNTA", "NTA- Do not put this guy on any mortgage or legal papers. From the couple sentences you\u2019ve stated, he sounds like a good time now. User. Something is off. Buying a home is long term. Buy your house with only you on the papers. If in a few years you are together/married and his ducks are in a row (has money equivalent to what a down payment would be), refinance the loan and put his name on the papers with you. Until then (I doubt), keep focus like you been. College fund for kids?", "NTA end this relationship NOW\n\nyou have fought hard for your financial security and he wants to steal it from you,  he doesn't bring anything to the table but risk / danger / insecurity / financial disaster.  That you might allow him spend the night occasionally. is as much as he might hope for.\n\nhis attempt at cohersive control could ruin your family .  Surely you have learnt by now - no man is better than a man who brings disaster. He is sweet NOW but once he is on the deed he will own your future.  He could move in his other family and you would not be able to stop him becuase you would be responsible to the bank.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with a life free of men , particularly men like this!  You need a man with a job, responisbilities so he doesn't make you homeless", "Ginormous red flags on his part.  You are definitely NTAH.  Ditch the bf now...", "NTA", "OMG, NTA\n\nDon't buy a house with anyone.  You need to make homelessness not a possibility for you and your children.\n\nWhen you buy a house, put it in a trust for your children with you as trustee.\n\nIf you move someone into the house, they pay market rate rent and their share of utilities as well as groceries. PERIOD.  Don't subsidize anyone in your life.  Ever.  Except your children.\n\nIf you do find yourself serious enough with someone where you want to buy a house together, then you rent out the house you have and earn income on that.  \n\nEvery state is slightly different on how to keep a real property sole and separate.  Follow those laws to the letter so no one can lay legal claim to your property.  Do not leave your financials around for someone to find.  Do not trust anyone to mail in a mortgage payment for you (same with utilities, taxes, insurance).  Do not commingle money.  Have a separate bank account for the trust that the house is in.  Seriously.  Don't let love for some guy make you financially vulnerable.  Buying a house is typically the larges financial investment you will make in your life.  Do not mix love with this kind of business.  \n\nAs a woman, I always recommend women have their own individual assets that are sole and separate from any romantic partner.  Men do this all the time.  Protect yourself financially and make it a priority to understand money.\n\nYou wouldn't believe the stuff ex's try to pull.  Even when an ex loses, you still have to pay your own lawyer.", "NTA. You\u2019ve only been together for six months, he doesn\u2019t work, and he\u2019s complaining about your plans to buy a house for your children without him? Uh\u2026", "NTA but are you sure he\u2019s such a great guy if he\u2019s asking you to give him half a house after 6 months? While he is u employed. And phrasing it as he would feel weird, not he would invest what he can do you can get a better home? \n\nHonestly he just sounds like a leech who thinks he has enough sway over you by now to start dropping the mask.", "NTA- I haven't had a chance to read all the replies yet.\n\nBut just be aware of the family laws for your location. Especially if you start to live together.  In my area family law treats you the same as married after living together for two years.   So part of the home you purchased before dating/living together could be divyed up during a separation.", "He insisted he would pay 50/50. \n\nBut - he isn't paying 50/50 is he? He can't pay half the deposit. He can't pay half the mortgage whilst unemployed. And he is your boyfriend of six months. He's got a sense of humour if nothing else. And it seems it is indeed nothing else he has to offer.\n\nProceed with your plans and your life. Good on you. Sounds like you deserve a man with a bit more about him.\n\nNTA.", "What.???? Buying homes are for married people?\n\nGo scratch. I owned two homes before I was 30, and damned if I wasn\u2019t single when I purchased each. I still own them by the way, and have as both a singleton and a paired up.\n\nWhat on earth - single people shouldn\u2019t own\u2026what?", "Thank you\u2764\ufe0f when I met him I had been single 2 years and very happy on my own, wasn\u2019t looking for anyone so when we met and hit it off it was nice for it to come out of nowhere. I\u2019m hoping his feelings stem from his own fear or something, rather than selfish motives. Either way I was fine on my own and would be fine again if the cards played out that way. Either way my kids are forever and I\u2019m not compromising", "I will definitely do that thank you", "I\u2019ve expressed to him that cohabitation isn\u2019t something that I\u2019ll consider for at least a year, my children have to trust him and be 100% down for him moving in for me to agree to it. They come first.\n\nthat being said, my children absolutely love him. He goes out of his way to spend quality time with them, especially my oldest who doesn\u2019t have his dad in the picture and hasn\u2019t since birth ( my youngest\u2019 s father is very involved and we split custody and are very civil)\n\nmy oldest calls my boyfriend his best friend, tells my boyfriend \" I love you \" and asks me all the time if I\u2019m going to marry this guy. Knowing my kids value his presence means so much to me, especially because I was single for 2 years before this knowing that I was looking for someone who would want to be in it for the long haul and truly want to be part of my family.\n\nim hoping that his feelings about the house stem from something much deeper than just wanting to mooch", "The plan is to buy another house when my kids are old enough to live in the first house on their own, so they never have to worry about if they have a roof over their heads. I\u2019d transfer the property to both of them once they become established and what they choose to do with the property from there will be up to them. They\u2019ll also have the option of working for me when they reach 16, so that by 18 they\u2019ll be financially stable. College will be a bridge we cross when they decide they\u2019re ready", "Wow\u2026that\u2019s crazy. I\u2019ll definitely be looking into the steps I need to take", "You're 6 months in and he's already trying to make financial decisions regarding your income and building equity together. That's a big marinara flag.   \n\n\nThe fact he's trying to pressure you into agreeing to it this early in is a problem. Honestly,  I think you're being more than fair to say he can contribute to the bills without paying rent. If he's living in your home, and it should be YOUR home, he shouldn't count on that being either a chance to build equity in a home on your credit, your money, or a chance to cut his own living expenses by a dramatic amount while you carry the financial burden for his living situation.   \n\n\nIt's been 6 months and he's already making all these plans and trying to coerce you into going along with them.   \n\n\nSo many kinds of no and I'm glad you're reconsidering the relationship.", "Go with your gut OP. I don\u2019t blame you one bit for wanting something that is 100% your own and your kids. If he can\u2019t understand your past trauma then he is not ready for this. \n\nYou are NTA. You are a hero for busting ass for the safety and security of your kids. Going from a 14 year old Mom to a home owner is a hell of a hard journey\u2026 I celebrate you for everything you\u2019ve had to go through to get to this moment. Great job Mama!", "You\u2019re being smart about this. Stick to your guns.", "You are a single mom and you deserve to have that peace of mind knowing that whatever happens, you and your kids have a stable home. He has no business trying to muscle in on your plans, especially after only six months.", "That's why you're super NTA tho. You're being incredibly reasonable and pragmatic and PUTTING YOUR KIDS FIRST!!\nBravo \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f", "I don\u2019t think they were saying single people shouldn\u2019t buy homes as much as they were saying buying homes with romantic partners is something done with spouses and not legally unaffiliated partners. \n\nI understand how you heard what you did, but the rest of their comment gives context to what they meant.", "Also NTA. A house with someone is one of those big commitments that you make within a legally bonded relationship. Not a bf of 6 months", "Keep in mind that marriage is not just a piece of paper a lot of people say it is. Make sure the person you marry is the one you want making medical decisions for you when you are incapacitated. If you have truly been away from your family and independent like I gathered from other comments, then be sure you appoint power of attorney to someone who you trust fully to fulfill your wish if legal marriage is off the table for you. Conversations like this are one of the many that are crucial before and legal binding relationship or contract is set in stone.", "Keep this clarity! It sounds like you have a good head on your shoulders!", "Perhaps. But it\u2019s still not a good reason to put him on the title. And the fact that he can\u2019t understand where you\u2019re coming from is a bit worrisome, especially when you\u2019re willing to invest in a business with him. And have not ruled out buying a house in the future, when he\u2019s actually able to contribute to funds.\n\nYou\u2019re NTA. If he can\u2019t see that, I\u2019d be worried about what levels of entitlement he\u2019s going to have about other things.", ">Though I know the information I\u2019ve shared doesn\u2019t paint him in the best light, he is a good man.\n\n\nHoney no. You have known this good man for all of 6 months. This is still the honeymoon phase. \n\nYou sound like a smart, hardworking woman. Please put down the rose tinted glasses especially now.", "You sound like you\u2019re wise and cautious\u2014a good parent. Best of luck!", "Sounds like you have a plan and are willing to work hard for it. Lucky kids. Glad you have each other. Best of luck & trust your gut. & Happy Easter.", "It definitely felt entitled to me, which seemed out of character based off what I\u2019ve seen so far though I know that only holds so much weight being we\u2019ve known each other less than a year. It raised some flags for me, so I\u2019ll be keeping an eye out as we continue our relationship. I\u2019ll be approaching the topic again next time we see each other and pay close attention to how he reacts and go from there. I\u2019m definitely not compromising so if he really can\u2019t see where I\u2019m coming from its best i found out 6 months in vs years down the road", "and he is already not working. I hope this will not be a pattern."]}
