Follow those laws to the letter so no one can lay legal claim to your property.  Do not leave your financials around for someone to find.  Do not trust anyone to mail in a mortgage payment for you (same with utilities, taxes, insurance).  Do not commingle money.  Have a separate bank account for the trust that the house is in.  Seriously.  Don't let love for some guy make you financially vulnerable.  Buying a house is typically the larges financial investment you will make in your life.  Do not mix love with this kind of business.  \n\nAs a woman, I always recommend women have their own individual assets that are sole and separate from any romantic partner.

The needs of you and your children come before his need for a free ride.", "On the off chance you both stay together and possibly get married, I'd still go see a lawyer and have it set in stone that if anything were to happen, death, divorce, whatever, that the house is the sole property of you and/or the children. You want to make sure that any financial contributions he puts towards the house/household do not entitle him to a piece of it should things not work out or death.", ">I, 27 F, have been with my boyfriend, 29 M, for 6 months\n\nNTA, and it's probably too soon for him to meet the kids, let alone move in.", "NTA.  you have very valid reasons.", "Nta at all. Especially for only 6 months with your boy", "NTA stick to your guns if he was a real one he would understand.", "NTA 1000% !! You\u2019ve been dating this guy for 6 months and considering that he cannot pay 50-50,  that\u2019s too big a risk to jump into home owning together. I think it\u2019s quite wise of you to not make any compromises. You do what you need to for your kids. And stay firm in your stance! Don\u2019t let him persuade you.", "NTA at all. To be entirely honest, I think it\u2019s really fishy that he is pushing for this this early. \n\nNot to mention that you\u2019re clearly an amazing and devoted mother, it really comes across in how you talk about your family. That said, you should really be with a partner that is not just understanding of your motives for buying a home for your kids, but someone that is fully supportive and excited for you. I\u2019m not necessarily saying your bf isn\u2019t that way or can\u2019t be that way after further communication, just that this seems really shady.", "Talk to a financial planner. And maybe a lawyer to\nProtect you and your kids. Good luck. You are doing awesome.", "Absolutely do not include him.", "What he should have said was in the event it doesn\u2019t work out he\u2019d like to split with a bunch of your money after contributing nothing. You need to run, not walk away from that guy. That\u2019s a ballsy ask from a freeloader", "NTA\n\nHis getting fired concerns me. So does asking to be put on a title or loan document after just six months of dating. It\u2019s way too early to do this. \n\nHe has a lot of nerve to ask. He has zero to bring to the table, but wants half of yours. \n\nStand your ground. Get an airtight prenup with whomever you marry. Consider not getting married at all, seriously. \n\nMake certain you don\u2019t let him freeload in the name of your wanting to be supportive in a relationship.", "You are a smart, I approve.\n\nNo ring? Pre-existing kids? Fuck off bud you can pay rent, thank you so much.", "NTA\nYou need to see a lawyer, without him being present.", "Nta", "You can save yourself the trouble and just give him half the money now. NTA, reconsider the relationship", "NTA if this relationship continues, sign a lease with him, as he is a tenant. Give him fair market value of someone living in a shared bedroom with their children. You need to pay the majority of utilities, and all home improvements.", "The unemployed boyfriend of just six months would feel weird about not being a 50/50 owner, but he doesn't feel weird about being unemployed and making absurd demands? Please say you don't live together and that you're not supporting him!\n\nIf you are, please get him out! The money you're spending supporting him is taking away from your children and your goal to purchase your own home!", "Kind of difficult.. of course you can do whatever you want with your money and you definitely worked hard for it.\n\nHowever he properly thinks that you aren't committed to him anf that obviously hurts him. He might also feel 'not being able to provide'.\n\nAs i said NTA but your boyfriend definitely feels left behind", "NTA \n\nYou been with him 6 months and you have kids don\u2019t let that man move anywhere with you. Don\u2019t even give him a key. Don\u2019t be desperate for a man that you move this guy who is sounding like a big red flag into your home with your kids.", "BIG nope. Do not include his name. That gives him rights to half your house and therefore half of its value, you busted your ass for. If he\u2019s not comfortable he can live somewhere else. NTA", "nta. he is a boyfriend not a husband. He has only been there 6 months. Naw focus on your children.", "Boyfriends don\u2019t get husband privileges. That includes co-owning property. The laws do not protect you in any way on that. If you split up, he would still own half the house. Absolute NTA.", "> he isn\u2019t currently working, he just got fired from his job\n\nYTA. You make the worst decisions. Your poor kids.", "Unless your kids agree, don\u2019t even let him move in. You all can get along much better without the drama. You\u2019re an awesome mom! Keep on keeping on! NTA", "NTA NTA NTA!\nYou are doing great, have your dream job, and you\u2019re going to provide a wonderful home for your kids. Of course, he\u2019s trying to hop onto that success train! After only six months of dating! While he is unemployed!\nDo not back down on this, it is incredibly important that you protect yourself, your investment, and your kids\u2019 future.  If he feels weird moving into a house that you own? Then maybe he doesn\u2019t have to move in! If he doesn\u2019t have 50% of the down payment and pay 50% of all of the bills? Then he does not get 50% of a house.\nIf he can\u2019t understand that, knowing what you have been through, then frankly, he is not the man for you.", "they are talking about 2 years in the future, there\u2019s a super good chance that in that time he can get a good job, save money and be very stable. and a goal like this would probably push him to do just that. theres no reason to believe hes mooching just because he was recently fired, discussing the future and setting goals is great. but none of that matters because his stability isnt the reason op doesnt want to buy a house with him.", "Can confirm about the men that specifically prey on single mothers. The red flags are flying and I hope to god OP doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s okay to provide anything for this man who feels entitled to her house after dating her for 6 measley months", "5-6 years ago people looked at my financial situation and decided I was a loser\u2026but now that I have an established career that doesn\u2019t happen because I have something to show for the work I put in.\n\nwhere I was 5-6 years ago didnt dictate where I was able to go. He\u2019s had to deal with a lot being an amputee trying to figure out what will be best for him career wise without pushing himself to the point of experiencing physical pain every day.   \nwhen I look at him I see a disabled man doing his best to find his path in a world that isn\u2019t set up for ease of success for even the most able bodied person. He isn\u2019t lazy in the slightest, I think he\u2019s fed up with working a 9 to 5 to make someone else money while being treated like a dollar sign rather than a human. he Doesn\u2019t have a history of unemployment, he consistently works but had his hours cut drastically only a few weeks before being fired, over a customer complaint. IMO they were looking for any reason to fire him and took the opportunity. (food service industry)  \nas someone who has gotten where I\u2019ve gotten without ever having a 9 to 5 job working for someone else I know what it\u2019s like to not be built for that. I couldn\u2019t do it, it\u2019d be soul crushing. I\u2019m very fortunate to have been 100% self employed, though it\u2019s not easy I get to make all the decisions for myself and I love it.   \nand I love him and want nothing more than for him to know what it feels like to be this liberated within a career. But again, it took 5 years to get here from my first career moves - that didn\u2019t make me instant money. I was a broke bitch - but a free bitch.\n\nmoney is a tool, that\u2019s all. I won\u2019t judge another human based on the amount of money they make. hes shown me how motivated he is to chase something more fulfilling, and Id rather have a partner who is happy than one who has full pockets", "yeah I\u2019m keeping my mouth shut from now on", "No I didn\u2019t ask him to move in, he brought up the question of if he would be involved in the house all by himself", "I don\u2019t support him in any way, he doesnt live with me", "Not only are you absolutely correct about not letting this guy own any of your house, but I hope you\u2019re not letting this random dude you\u2019ve been dating for half a year move in with you and your children. They don\u2019t need to be put through the emotional wringer and the possibly dangerous position of having to live with men you barely know and have no idea whether the relationship will work out or not.", "I totally agree! And the fact that he's demanding this after only being together for 6 months is frankly obnoxious behavior. Considering what you have gone through, please hold your ground and go with your original plans. Your kids are the MOST important people in your life, now and forever \u2764 And congrats on everything that you have accomplished \ud83d\udca5", "Listen, you\u2019ve been with him 6 months - you hardly even know him (studies show we don\u2019t really start to now our partners till - on average - 2 years in). That he\u2019s even suggesting this is a red flag to me. Like I\u2019d step back from the relationship with someone who six months in wants to pay nothing but be given half of my house. \n\nNTA. But you really need to give a second thought to staying with this guy.", "That is a very wise move to get the house in your name and make sure your children have a home in the future.", "Your answer is \u201cHell. No.\u201d\n\nNTA\n\nThere is wayyyyy too much that can go wrong in a relationship and the fact that he is asking this after six months of dating is a HUGE RED FLAG. \ud83d\udea9 \n\nHe needs to absolutely back off as he is the asshole.", "NTA, and he CAN still contribute 50-50 \u2014 let\u2019s use simple numbers for this example. Mortgage is $1,000. Cable and phone is $200, water/gas/electric/trash is $300, gardener is $125, hamster walker is $75, groceries are $350, zombie survival/HOA is $150. Obviously these are goofy, but the point stands.\n\nI\u2019m wondering if maybe he is nervous about living with someone who has sole ownership who may not include him in any decisions. Legally, you don\u2019t have to of course, but maybe he\u2019s hoping for some input on, say, the paint color of the bedroom you share. Maybe that\u2019s the conversation that would be helpful \u2014 would he assist with decisions about X but not Y? Will you discuss with him but he has to know you may veto his ideas? That sort of thing\u2026.", "Exactly. He has zero to offer you, but wants what you have. I own my home outright and it\u2019s amazing how a guy thinks he can coast through life because of my backbreaking work to get my home. \n\nDon\u2019t marry anyone who is not your financial equal. The world is full of takers looking to take what you e worked hard for. \n\nHonestly, after all the betrayals by the people closest to me, I have learned to trust no one. It\u2019s the safest way.", "Uh.. HE IS MOOCHING BECAUSE HE WANTS HIS NAME ON THE TITLE WITHOUT PAYING DOWN.  I didn\u2019t assume anything.  I literally said it could be revisited in the future.", "There seems to be a pattern here of him consistently pushing for a legally binding commitment - marriage, house, business.  Given you have only been together for 6 months, and that he is currently unemployed, this is of significant concern.  He is not respecting your wishes, nor the incredible work you have done to get to where you are.  His rationale that he wouldn\u2019t feel right in a house that isn\u2019t his is absolute bullshit.  Despite him having absolutely no assets to bring to the situation (or sense of shame), you seem to already be justifying and explaining your hard earned wishes, and placating him with promises of other properties and a business!  \n\nIt has been said by several people here, but take a big step back and evaluate this relationship.  This pressure, despite such imbalance in income and effort should. Not. Exist.\n\nThe fact that you don\u2019t seem to be able to acknowledge this means that this could sadly be the start of a path for you (and your kids) that you will one day wish you never went down.", "While he can be a great guy. The fact that he didn't bring up and say to you that he will work and save his butt off to help with half of the down payment says everything you need to know, it's strange he wants 50/50 but not 50/50 with the deposit, it doesn't make sense, if he wants something to be equal with you, he should want to pay everything equal from the get go.", "You are not listening to the unanimous warnings that he is bad news, and the more you \u201cexplain\u201d how great he is, the more red flags are appearing.  Don\u2019t think you are somehow above being played.  I feel that this will end up being a tragic BORU when you are on here asking for legal advice on how to protect your few remaining assets in the separation.", "You're being wilfully ignorant or you misread and misunderstood the comment. I'm sorry.", "Allowing him to get THAT close to your kids in just 6 months is concerning.  You really don't know someone after 6 months, at all.\n\nI would pump the brakes a bit.  He's showing a massive red flag here, and you need to take off the rose colored glasses and put a little space between him and your kids.  If you don't and this goes south, your kids will be crushed.", "Sorry OP, but this a pretty obvious red flag. Ignoring will be on you.\n6 months and already want to be possessive over your and kids shit.", "You also say that even when he was employed he was earning far less than you\u2026. So even if he finds another job he\u2019s STILL not in a financial position to have anything to contribute!", "Wow he brought it up himself??? that's even worse...", "Given his attitude already, if you do this it will be YEARS of tension, and \u201cgentle reminders\u201d by you to him to contribute what he should.  After all of that, if he has lived with you for any decent period of time, he can likely try to go to the courts for a percentage of ownership if you split up.", "You seem like a very smart cookie!", "No I rent a house by myself", "Thats my thought exactly.  Even forgetting about the kids.  Its been 6 months.  You really want to share ownership in a house purchase at 6 months?\n\nAnd 200% agree with your 1 - 2 - 3.", "no way, I haven\u2019t lived with a guy since I was with my youngest child\u2019s father 7 years ago. In no rush to change that", "I\u2019ve already stated that I\u2019m owning this house on my own and im not compromising. It was never a question of should I or should I not. I\u2019m not. And I never said anything about being above anything", "Yup, twice. First time I misunderstood what he meant and thought he meant would he be moving in - told him it was something we could talk about when it came time. Then he brought up the topic again like a week later and that\u2019s when I realized what he was actually asking", "He is not the right guy for you. He just showed that he does not think it\u2019s right to put your kids first. There are guys out there that would. Be kind to yourself and let this one go", "I don\u2019t even think a partner in a relationship starts showing their true colors until after 3 years or so.  Less if they are unhinged.  If after 6 months this is what he\u2019s demanding I can\u2019t even imagine 3 years.", "What you have seen so far from your entitled, unemployed, camper van living boyfriend OF SIX MONTHS?!  There are already enough red flags here, even at this early stage.", "100% this.  It would be a great litmus test to see if this guy is even worth continuing to date.  If he reacts negatively AT ALL, he is quite clearly looking at you as a meal ticket.", "I wouldn't put him on the mortgage, even if he had a full time job. Mostly because they've only been dating 6 months.  But he said it would feel weird. That's far from a  \"demand to owning half this house\".", "I think that could definitely be at least part of the issue", "Yes they would, if Op makes enough money and has the credit they don't care if you add your significant other as long as that person doesn't have a negative that precludes being on a loan.  It's how housewives were put on mortgages 40 years ago.", "Owning half the house he can\u2019t afford to pay for. That\u2019s some big ones.", "I'm lost as to why you replied to my comment.  It has no relevance."]}
