I work 40 hours a week and am currently attending evening school to obtain a master's degree. My wife got a new job half a year ago, where she works 20 hours a week in shifts with irregular hours. The job is a 45-minute bus ride or a 10-minute car ride away. She doesn't have a driver's license yet, so I often have to bring her to and from work. For safety reasons, her work has a policy where employees are not allowed to walk or bike home from work when their shift ends at 23:30 or 02:30. However, if they finish at 17:30, they can.\n\nSince my wife doesn't have a car, I do all the grocery shopping and take the kids to daycare, among other household tasks that we split equally. I have been urging her to get her driver's license and have set aside money to help her get it quickly after passing the theoretical driver exam. Sometimes, I feel exhausted because when she works late, I have to take care of the kids in the morning so she can sleep in. As she loves to sleep, I try to let her sleep in almost every day. I start working from home at 7:30 and take care of the kids at the same time until 10 or 11. So, once a week or even less, I ask her to get up with the kids so I can sleep in. She always says yes, but in 75% of these mornings, she doesn't get up in the morning. She knows that once I am fully awake, I find it difficult to go back to sleep, and mostly, I am fine with that.\n\nThis morning was the same. She agreed to get up yesterday, and after I went to the bathroom and returned to bed, I could hear the kids waking up at 6 am (their usual time), so I woke my wife up. She replied that she didn't hear the kids and that since I was already up, I could also get up with the kids. So, I did but felt disrespected and was raging inside. As a result, I woke her up at 7:00 (she had a day shift starting at 9:30, and I planned on taking her to work with the car at 9:00). She woke up, and I told her that since she was already awake, she could take the bus to work.\n\nP.S. My friends have already told me that I am a bit crazy for doing so much for her, but I don't care and love doing it, and I don't want to change this. However, I would like to know if I am the asshole for drawing a line and telling her to take the bus today and also AITA wanting to sleep in once a week.", "created_utc": 1681107456, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12h9ddz/aita_for_telling_my_wife_to_get_to_bus_to_work/", "score": 172, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your wife found herself a chump. She should probably let that chump sleep in once in a while if she doesn't want to pick one of the other three options.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your wife needs to realise she is a mother and a wife. You have stepped up.

Just pick her up when it\u2019s the late shift", "NTA - I don't drive and know that it is my responsibility to ensure I can get to places by public transport on my own. \n\nWe were away for the long weekend as hubby was doing a course. He dripped me off one morning at a museum I was interested in but I used local buses the other days.", "INFO\n\nI voted info because you're really asking two or three questions at once and all of them have different possibilities.\n\nI do agree that, just from what you've said, she seems pretty lazy. Just from what you said, it seems like her love of sleep is coming at your expense and that she definitely has a sense of entitlement and isn't putting in her fair share. You have to work full time, go to school and raise the family while she only works part time and contributes (just from what you've said anyways) very little to the family unit. With as little as she works, she should be doing a LOT more for the household/kids.\n\nThat being said, you mentioned safety concerns. Honestly, if it's too dangerous for her to walk to and from work, I would say that riding the bus is probably not that much safer. So, from the standpoint of caring about your wife's safety, I do think you have a moral obligation to drive her to and from work when you are able.\n\nIf she's making you get up just to take care of the kids, she's in the wrong for sure. If she's making you get up early to take her to and from work, that's just a part of your responsibility as a husband to ensure your wife's safety.", "Seems like she\u2019s the only one working and you\u2019re refusing to drive a 10 min distance.

You just have a more balanced household when it comes to tasks. Just speak to your wife about the sleeping in thing, it could just be that she's having difficulty waking up. People are different.\n\nWould say your friends are TAs. You aren't \"doing so much for her\" you're doing a fair share for the household.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I have done kinda the same thing with my wife in the past... She would get mad here and there, but came around to why I did it.", "NTA my friend", "Yeah, like even if you love doing it you\u2019re being taken for granted and that will take a toll on you. It\u2019s not a good dynamic, she needs to step up and be pulling her weight in other areas. \nYou\u2019re very much NTA but you need to be firmer on your boundaries even if it\u2019s over somthing you love doing (like minding your kids) or you would be TA to yourself.", "The only issue seems to be her love for sleep. Man takes care of the children during the day when she\u2019s at work. Get a grip.", "I was thinking the same thing. Obviously, it\u2019s not always the safest to walk around at 2:30 am particularly as a woman but her workplace can\u2019t tell her she can\u2019t do it. \n\nThat reminds me so much of my old workplace\u2019s policy; everyone had to leave together for safety. Except that meant I had to sit around for 30-45 min for the last person to finish up. My manager told me this policy, then informed me it could be more than 30 mins & I was like \u201cyeah bye\u201d & walked out the door. I got better things to do at night then hang around my workplace for half an hour.", "She didnt have to work yesterday.", "When she has the shift wich ends in late evening or in the night there are safety issues. Then she can take a ride with collegue or black taxi if there isnt any i insist she calls me and i pick her up. Thats not the issue here. In the morning and day there are no safety issues.\n\nNormally i do take her when there are no safety issues because it saves her time, but now i was like why should i do that when she was like why should i get up with the kids.", "I work 40 hours a week and i am the main costwinner. I try to work home as much as possible for the kids and her. Next to that i have to study for my master outside of working hours. She only works 20 hours a week.", "Our relationship is fine thats what makes this thing so difficult since it is the only thing.\n\nI do talk about it, every time i get up i say i didnt like it and i would live to get up next time. She said i have to kick her till she gets up. Wich i think is a bit harsh, but this morning she was \"awake\" but basicly just said no. That actually made me mad, and i know my response was petty. But was it appropiate and how else can i give right to my feelings?", "How is he doing a fair share? He\u2019s working 40hrs each week, getting his masters, getting groceries, doing half the chores, dropping and pickup the kids from daycare, getting up with them most days, and dropping and picking her up from work. \n\nHow is that a fair split? She\u2019s working 20 weeks, refuses to get her drivers license, doesn\u2019t drive, and won\u2019t get up with the kids. So again\u2026.how is he doing his fair share?", "OP is also working whilst he\u2019s taking care of the children in fact he works double the amount of hours a week than his wife does", "And he drivers to work and picks her up and he does all the grocery shopping. If you're ok with not being respected by your partner that's fine, to each their own, but OP clearly has a problem with this.", "Then, in that case, you're NTA. You're doing a lot more than her in general, and she could show her thanks by letting you sleep in once a week.", "Ahh\u2026 I assumed it was just an evening class\u2026 well then she should do more to take care for the kids especially is she\u2019s not at work. \n\nYou still should\u2019ve drove her 10 mins that was a piss-off move. It also won\u2019t get the point across unless you directly explain the issue to her.\n\nIf she loves to sleep she\u2019s still gonna sleep in the morning. Hopefully, she\u2019d get her license and wouldn\u2019t have to worry about such issues.", "Thats why its just a soft yta. \n\nYou really need to sit and have a full conversation and find out from both sides what is going on. \nIs it a big deal to get the bus? No. You're not in the wrong for feeling upset, thats valid. But the petty road leads to resentment. You're both only human and you need to talk and make sure you're both supporting each other for it to work long term.", "I bet she dresses, washes, changes and plays with the kids. Just because man does groceries and drives a car doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not 50/50. \n\nTwo points you claimed are invalid as they both do chores and groceries aren\u2019t a big deal.", "And? Do you know how many households its just the mother doing all that stuff?\n\nIm not seeing a definite *wont* get up with the kids but again, she seems to be working irregular hours which could account for a struggle. We also dont have info enough, even assuming OP is a reliable narrator, to determine the possibility of postpartum.\nAs for the refusal to get a driver's license OP either hasn't asked whats holding her back from it so we have no idea if it is an actual refusal. \n\nSorry if you disagree but I don't feel like its right to bitch about what needs to be done in a household when they chose to have kids. This is part and parcel. Things need doing, you do it. If you feel undervalued by a partner then you have a discussion like an adult.", "It\u2019s a 10 min drive. Grocery isn\u2019t a big deal. You sound like you\u2019re used to women doing everything. Once we see a man doing grocery and it\u2019s a major issue.\n\nThis is a basic relationship that\u2019s been working. There\u2019s no problem. \n\nOP is just being persuaded by his goofy friends. He\u2019s only upset about his wife sleeping-in.", "Driver license would be the ultimate solution, actually if i would see progression in the effort it would make it a lot more easy for me. \n\nI have explained the issue many many many times. And she says i have to kick her out of bed, wich i think is a bit harsh. But this morning she was awake and basicly just said \"no\".\n\nThanks for your advice", "How is she dressing, washing and changing the kids in her sleep?", "No postpartum (i am worked as nurse for years). i tend to think i am pretty objective. And more details about chores. We both clean, do dishes. Se mostly washes (80-20%). I do most of my ironing (75-25%). I mostly cook (80-20%) and driving tasks al me. A", "It\u2019s doesn\u2019t matter what other household do. It matters what happens in their household. OP\u2019s basically working two jobs while doing all the groceries shopping, driving, and splitting the chores 50/50. \n\nClearly, he\u2019s talked to her if he\u2019s suggested to her to both get up with the kids and get a lic nose multiple times. She refuses. Op literally said she was up and refused to get up with the kids. \n\nYou mentioned because she\u2019s working at irregular hours she\u2019s must be tired. OP working full time while studying and doing his masters. Does he get the same excuse? According to you, he doesn\u2019t.", ">You sound like you\u2019re used to women doing everything.\n\nI'm interest in knowing where you got this from. Expecting a relationship to be 50/50 equates to me being used to women doing everything for me? Sounds like a major projection to me.", "Then to me the issue appears to be a case of feeling undervalued to be honest. All I can suggest is you find time when the kids are in bed to have a heart to heart.\n\nYou both need to air these feelings out and maybe make a conscious decision to acknowledge each other. And not to be funny but objectivity goes out the window when its a situation you're close to.\n\nI do wish you the best and hope you both can find a way through this so bad feelings dont fester in the future.", "Projection much?\n\nI didn't say anything about it being an excuse so stop showing your arse. Being a parent is tiring, of course they're both going to be tired. But doing stuff like groceries is really not that huge of a deal and doesn't need fanfare.\n\n\nIf OP feels like the burden is unequal then they have an ADULT conversation, not resort to petty action.", "You assuming the relationship isn\u2019t fair and telling OP to stop enabling her. He only expresses being upset over her sleeping.\n\nI did assume for the most part and it\u2019s because posts only get such attention when it seems like the man is doing a little bit more work than a woman in the household.", "Unless OP withdrew information, his relationship sounds far from 50/50, maybe 80/20 was an exaggeration, but my point still stands.\n\nAlso, I didn't make it a gender issue so it confuses me why you brought OP being a man up, but maybe it's an issue on this sub that I'm not aware of.\n\nHaving said that, we've heard similar stories coming from women, and the vast majority of the comments agree that OP's bf/ husband is not doing enough. Why can't that also be the case when the genders are reveresed?\n\nUltimately, I disagree that OP doesn't have an issue with the situation. Having to do so much is clearly taking a tool on him, to the point where he's at least urging his wife to get a license and saving money for her. The least she can do is to wake up in the morning after SHE AGREED to it.", "It is a gender issue. \n\nOP is a grown man with children. He didn\u2019t choose his lifestyle out of the blue. \n\nWe are nobody to consider his viewpoint outside of what was the issue here. \n\nIf his lifestyle was taking a toll on him it wouldn\u2019t have gone as far to have children.\n\nHe was in no way forced to be with the woman he chose to be with. Everything was upfront for the choices he made.\n\nThe only issue here is wife is sleeping.", "NTA, you are working twice the hours, school on top of that, all the driving, and still 50/50 with the chores.\n\nYour wife isn't pulling her weight.  No excuses she isn't doing her share.  Maybe the driving isn't the end all be all, but a realistic discussion over how to make this fair for both of you is needed.  I get that working odd hours is tough but you are burnt out and can't keep this going", "I think your wife is selfish as heck, but it\u2019s your own fault for enabling her selfishness. \n\nESH, tell her to get off her arse (or out of bed), and take her turn. More fool you for giving in to her", "So to pick her up late in the evening or in the middle of the night are you waking both kids up to put them in the car and go get her? I can't understand the logic here"]}
