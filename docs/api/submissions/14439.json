I work 40 hours a week and am currently attending evening school to obtain a master's degree. My wife got a new job half a year ago, where she works 20 hours a week in shifts with irregular hours. The job is a 45-minute bus ride or a 10-minute car ride away. She doesn't have a driver's license yet, so I often have to bring her to and from work. For safety reasons, her work has a policy where employees are not allowed to walk or bike home from work when their shift ends at 23:30 or 02:30. However, if they finish at 17:30, they can.\n\nSince my wife doesn't have a car, I do all the grocery shopping and take the kids to daycare, among other household tasks that we split equally. I have been urging her to get her driver's license and have set aside money to help her get it quickly after passing the theoretical driver exam. Sometimes, I feel exhausted because when she works late, I have to take care of the kids in the morning so she can sleep in. As she loves to sleep, I try to let her sleep in almost every day. I start working from home at 7:30 and take care of the kids at the same time until 10 or 11. So, once a week or even less, I ask her to get up with the kids so I can sleep in. She always says yes, but in 75% of these mornings, she doesn't get up in the morning. She knows that once I am fully awake, I find it difficult to go back to sleep, and mostly, I am fine with that.\n\nThis morning was the same. She agreed to get up yesterday, and after I went to the bathroom and returned to bed, I could hear the kids waking up at 6 am (their usual time), so I woke my wife up. She replied that she didn't hear the kids and that since I was already up, I could also get up with the kids. So, I did but felt disrespected and was raging inside. As a result, I woke her up at 7:00 (she had a day shift starting at 9:30, and I planned on taking her to work with the car at 9:00). She woke up, and I told her that since she was already awake, she could take the bus to work.\n\nP.S. My friends have already told me that I am a bit crazy for doing so much for her, but I don't care and love doing it, and I don't want to change this.

Your wife found herself a chump. She should probably let that chump sleep in once in a while if she doesn't want to pick one of the other three options.\n\nNTA", "NTA.

Just from what you said, it seems like her love of sleep is coming at your expense and that she definitely has a sense of entitlement and isn't putting in her fair share. You have to work full time, go to school and raise the family while she only works part time and contributes (just from what you've said anyways) very little to the family unit. With as little as she works, she should be doing a LOT more for the household/kids.\n\nThat being said, you mentioned safety concerns. Honestly, if it's too dangerous for her to walk to and from work, I would say that riding the bus is probably not that much safer. So, from the standpoint of caring about your wife's safety, I do think you have a moral obligation to drive her to and from work when you are able.\n\nIf she's making you get up just to take care of the kids, she's in the wrong for sure. If she's making you get up early to take her to and from work, that's just a part of your responsibility as a husband to ensure your wife's safety.", "[deleted]", "Soft yta for being petty.\n\nI get that you're exhausted but you're a parent.

Except that meant I had to sit around for 30-45 min for the last person to finish up.

She\u2019s working 20 weeks, refuses to get her drivers license, doesn\u2019t drive, and won\u2019t get up with the kids.

Do you know how many households its just the mother doing all that stuff?\n\nIm not seeing a definite *wont* get up with the kids but again, she seems to be working irregular hours which could account for a struggle.

This is part and parcel. Things need doing, you do it.

Sounds like a major projection to me.", "Then to me the issue appears to be a case of feeling undervalued to be honest. All I can suggest is you find time when the kids are in bed to have a heart to heart.\n\nYou both need to air these feelings out and maybe make a conscious decision to acknowledge each other. And not to be funny but objectivity goes out the window when its a situation you're close to.\n\nI do wish you the best and hope you both can find a way through this so bad feelings dont fester in the future.", "Projection much?\n\nI didn't say anything about it being an excuse so stop showing your arse. Being a parent is tiring, of course they're both going to be tired.

Why can't that also be the case when the genders are reveresed?\n\nUltimately, I disagree that OP doesn't have an issue with the situation.

That's really not OK. \n\nIf you wont try to fix it for yourself, how about your kids?

I am not suggesting divorce or therapy.  What I am is actually talk to each other like partners should.

But, the no driver license thing is just ridiculous.  I don't think it's a good habit for any parent to limit their available transportation options.  Shit happens, plans fail, buses get delayed, you won't always be available, and eventually, your wife will need to drive a car without you to save the day.  The only reason things aren't so bad (yet) is because you have infant kids.  Are you also going to be the family driver during all school meetings, extracurriculars, sports, doctor appointments, meetups, etc. that aren't walking distance or bus convienent?
