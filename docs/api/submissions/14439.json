I work 40 hours a week and am currently attending evening school to obtain a master's degree. My wife got a new job half a year ago, where she works 20 hours a week in shifts with irregular hours. The job is a 45-minute bus ride or a 10-minute car ride away. She doesn't have a driver's license yet, so I often have to bring her to and from work. For safety reasons, her work has a policy where employees are not allowed to walk or bike home from work when their shift ends at 23:30 or 02:30. However, if they finish at 17:30, they can.\n\nSince my wife doesn't have a car, I do all the grocery shopping and take the kids to daycare, among other household tasks that we split equally. I have been urging her to get her driver's license and have set aside money to help her get it quickly after passing the theoretical driver exam. Sometimes, I feel exhausted because when she works late, I have to take care of the kids in the morning so she can sleep in. As she loves to sleep, I try to let her sleep in almost every day. I start working from home at 7:30 and take care of the kids at the same time until 10 or 11. So, once a week or even less, I ask her to get up with the kids so I can sleep in. She always says yes, but in 75% of these mornings, she doesn't get up in the morning. She knows that once I am fully awake, I find it difficult to go back to sleep, and mostly, I am fine with that.\n\nThis morning was the same. She agreed to get up yesterday, and after I went to the bathroom and returned to bed, I could hear the kids waking up at 6 am (their usual time), so I woke my wife up. She replied that she didn't hear the kids and that since I was already up, I could also get up with the kids. So, I did but felt disrespected and was raging inside. As a result, I woke her up at 7:00 (she had a day shift starting at 9:30, and I planned on taking her to work with the car at 9:00). She woke up, and I told her that since she was already awake, she could take the bus to work.\n\nP.S. My friends have already told me that I am a bit crazy for doing so much for her, but I don't care and love doing it, and I don't want to change this. However, I would like to know if I am the asshole for drawing a line and telling her to take the bus today and also AITA wanting to sleep in once a week.", "created_utc": 1681107456, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12h9ddz/aita_for_telling_my_wife_to_get_to_bus_to_work/", "score": 659, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

With as little as she works, she should be doing a LOT more for the household/kids.\n\nThat being said, you mentioned safety concerns. Honestly, if it's too dangerous for her to walk to and from work, I would say that riding the bus is probably not that much safer. So, from the standpoint of caring about your wife's safety, I do think you have a moral obligation to drive her to and from work when you are able.\n\nIf she's making you get up just to take care of the kids, she's in the wrong for sure.

Except that meant I had to sit around for 30-45 min for the last person to finish up. My manager told me this policy, then informed me it could be more than 30 mins & I was like \u201cyeah bye\u201d & walked out the door.

But was it appropiate and how else can i give right to my feelings?", "How is he doing a fair share? He\u2019s working 40hrs each week, getting his masters, getting groceries, doing half the chores, dropping and pickup the kids from daycare, getting up with them most days, and dropping and picking her up from work. \n\nHow is that a fair split?

No. You're not in the wrong for feeling upset, thats valid. But the petty road leads to resentment. You're both only human and you need to talk and make sure you're both supporting each other for it to work long term.", "I bet she dresses, washes, changes and plays with the kids.

All I can suggest is you find time when the kids are in bed to have a heart to heart.\n\nYou both need to air these feelings out and maybe make a conscious decision to acknowledge each other. And not to be funny but objectivity goes out the window when its a situation you're close to.\n\nI do wish you the best and hope you both can find a way through this so bad feelings dont fester in the future.", "Projection much?\n\nI didn't say anything about it being an excuse so stop showing your arse. Being a parent is tiring, of course they're both going to be tired.

He only expresses being upset over her sleeping.\n\nI did assume for the most part and it\u2019s because posts only get such attention when it seems like the man is doing a little bit more work than a woman in the household.", "Unless OP withdrew information, his relationship sounds far from 50/50, maybe 80/20 was an exaggeration, but my point still stands.\n\nAlso, I didn't make it a gender issue so it confuses me why you brought OP being a man up, but maybe it's an issue on this sub that I'm not aware of.\n\nHaving said that, we've heard similar stories coming from women, and the vast majority of the comments agree that OP's bf/ husband is not doing enough. Why can't that also be the case when the genders are reveresed?\n\nUltimately, I disagree that OP doesn't have an issue with the situation. Having to do so much is clearly taking a tool on him, to the point where he's at least urging his wife to get a license and saving money for her.

You obviously care about your marriage, leaving unfairness to rankle isn't going to be good for it in the long term.\nYour wife is being a lazy, inconsiderate partner.

I am not suggesting divorce or therapy.  What I am is actually talk to each other like partners should.  I have a feeling that defined roles have been set in your relationship, but in doing so, some hard feelings are being brought up.  \"Festering\" wounds tend to get infected and cause more issues, please keep this in mind", "INFO how did she react to you making her get up and take the bus?", "INFO:  Does she handle evenings with the kids while you're at school?\n\nAnyways, NTA in this case because when she agrees to let you sleep in, you're permitted to hold her to her word.  But, the no driver license thing is just ridiculous.  I don't think it's a good habit for any parent to limit their available transportation options.  Shit happens, plans fail, buses get delayed, you won't always be available, and eventually, your wife will need to drive a car without you to save the day.  The only reason things aren't so bad (yet) is because you have infant kids.  Are you also going to be the family driver during all school meetings, extracurriculars, sports, doctor appointments, meetups, etc. that aren't walking distance or bus convienent? If you haven't discussed that with your wife already, you should probably ask her to practice more foresight in that regard and start driving.  And, the sooner she drives, the sooner she'll be a better and safer driver for the kids as well.", "NTA. You\u2019ve been enabling her, and she\u2019s probably going to push back because of it.", "You realize she's never going to get her driver's license. If she's 40 and hasn't gotten it yet, she isn't going to. So if you're staying in this relationship, start planning to chauffer everyone around until the kids have their drivers license.", "Does your wife at least know how to drive?", "You wouldn't be in this sub if you didn't think you were being taken advantage of. So there's that. Now you need to find your voice and tell your wife all the things you said in your post. What you did was passive aggressive, and will do nothing to fix your problem. You chose to fan the flames instead. I don't think you are necessarily wrong, but your relationship doesn't seem at all balanced. Just use your words. What do you have to lose?", "Telling her to take the bus was passive aggressive because you won't force the real issue - having her live up to her commitment to get up and take care of the kids.   You need to learn to have that honest and frank discussion with her and then hold her to her commitments and NOT let her gaslight you into doing what she wants.  Next time she tells you youre already up, tell her \"well if youre talking to me - so are you .. so get up and do what you said you would.\" then lay back down and let her get it done.", "I\u2019m", "What your wife is doing is a term called weaponized incompetence. NTA.\n\nEdit: did the wrong ruling by mistake", "Given the 24h notation I'm guessing OP is not in the US so the lack of driver's license is less unusual.\n\nI'm with you on thinking the employer can take a long walk off a short pier telling employees how they're \"allowed\" to get home.", "Yeah I'm not sure I believed that part.", "I agree but see a downside. Sounds like wife would say hooray! if she got fired, and sleep all day. Can\u2019t drive, can\u2019t grocery shop, can\u2019t take the kids to school, hubby\u2019s working. Nap time!", "That's completely normal outside the USA. If there's an emergency, you call an ambulance. If it isn't an emergency, you call a taxi or an uber or take the bus or walk or bike.", "Hes also working his full time job while he takes care of the kids!  So hes earning a living AND saving them on day care costs.  And the kids are 1 and 3!  I have older kids and remember that age and cannot imagine trying to do my full time duties and occupy them.  Fuck outta here with this comment.", "Unless you're getting paid for that time you can't be forced to stay. I had a job in college where you'd close and clock out at 10 then have to wait like half hour while the drawers were closed and stuff. I clocked out as I was actually leaving and my manager had a fit for going over hours, but once I said I would ask the Dept. of Labor the rules for being forced to stay without pay she shut the fuck rather fast.", "No, but they can fire her for whatever reason", "I'm 39 and don't have a license and never will. But I live in Toronto and recent transit violence aside, we have a fairly decent transit system. I can also walk to the grocery store/pharmacy in less than 10 minutes.", "Very possible although I don\u2019t thing using 24 hour notation is necessarily a sign.  I\u2019ve used it my entire life because my father used it when he was in the military.  I know it is less common with GenZ, but used quite a lot still in the US", "That makes sense no aloneness with a client. I was working at a big box store. I understand why they implemented a safety policy (someone got mugged walking to the bus) but making everyone wait rather than just having people leave in small groups or a security escorts was stupid.", "My ex manager tried to make me stay 30min longer than I'm paid. I just left every time as soon I finished, she just couldn't do anything to make me stay. I still remember her angry faces every time she tried to force that but couldn't.", "It is absolutely feasible in way more of the US than \u201ccities like New York.\u201d  Virtually any city with a population greater than 200,000 will do, and many smaller cities will also work.  People just don\u2019t want to do it out of both laziness and misinformed risk perception.", "Grocery is a big deal when you\u2019re shopping for a family.", "Definitely! After the client left we never waited more than 5 min, maybe 10 on a bad night.", "Honestly getting paid an extra half hour wasn't bad, I needed all the money I could get for my expensive as hell college. Also I usually closed with my best friend so I took the pay. But I'm the only one who got paid because no one else dared do it for whatever reason.", "Sure, but she is still using a car everywhere.  Even if it is her boyfriend driving or ubering.  \n\nMy response was to the person who said in Europe they mostly bike and use public transport. Those options aren\u2019t viable in most places in the US due to how cities are setup.", "Well, I\u2019ve lived in roughly 20 cities of 200k or more folks in the US and only maybe a quarter of them would be feasible for a car-less lifestyle.  Of course, it also depends on what you do for work.  It requires your job opportunities, groceries, and affordable housing to be on public transit routes with service that is regular, safe and reliable.  \n\nThat is not my experience in most US cities.  But I\u2019m glad to hear your experiences have been otherwise.", "Most people love to sleep, ffs, that doesn't mean we get out of pulling our fair share in life.  She needs to start doing her part and get her license.", "I thought you just were talking about driving.", "I mean, I wouldn\u2019t consider relying on other people to drive you everywhere super sustainable, either.  That also will very much limit where one can live in the US. \n\nBut specifically in the comment you responded to I was talking about biking and using public transportation."]}
