{"id": 31323, "submission_id": "17z9gk3", "title": "AITA for refusing to pay for my father's memorial service?", "selftext": "My father died in early 2020. My sister and I had not seen him for years as his wife isolated him from his family (long story). We sat with him when he died (his wife did not come to the hospital) but the body was released to his wife. His wife did not have a funeral. \n\nMy sister and I wanted to have a service and we decided on his birthday, six months later. I contacted the funeral home she had her heart set on and, after hearing the pricing, told her in an email that I could not afford to pay for a traditional funeral home service and would not do so. I told her that I would be happy to plan something cheaper but I could not add to my existing debt load. She wrote back that it was okay, she would take care of the cost. \n\nMy sister and I have a very difficult relationship that I generally owe to her lack of emotional regulation and outbursts of anger. So, when I found out that my Dad's twin brother's family was planning a milestone birthday party for him on the day we had discussed having the funeral, I asked her to change the date. She refused. In fact, she sent me four abusive, expletive laden emails. She then proceeded to plan the funeral and write the obituary and she did all of this without acknowledging any of my other requests. \n\nSince then, my relationship with my sister has been more difficult as our mother has become ill and I have had to put in place very strong boundaries, including blocking her cell number due to abusive texts. Earlier this year, I was diagnosed with PTSD. I was also deemed eligible for a tax credit for disabled people (I'm in Canada) so long story short, I'm receiving a lump sum of money due to backdated tax reassessments and this money will go toward paying the debt I have, a large part of which is a result of the therapy I receive for PTSD. I told my mother about this, and asked her not to tell my sister. She did. \n\nTwo days ago, my sister sent me an email asking me if I was going to contribute to the cost of our father's funeral. I sent her the email exchange in which I tell her I cannot afford a traditional funeral and that I cannot pay for it, and her response in which she says she will take care of it. She responded to this by saying: I'll remember this, which reads to me like a threat. \n\nI spoke to our mother, who said I should pay for half the funeral. I told her in no uncertain terms that it is very upsetting to me that she thinks I should take the money that I received for a disability and give it to my sister to pay for something that I did not want, said very clearly that I could not afford, and was not involved in planning. My mother is now calling me and crying that she is sorry but that she thinks I should 'do the right thing' which is give my sister money. I have not communicated with my sister further about this and do not plan to. \n\nAm I the asshole? Thanks.
