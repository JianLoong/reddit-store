You proved that despite his belief he was just being appropriately logical and rational his comments were lacking in compassion just as you said, because when you described his situation with the same sort of cold logic and rational thinking instead of accepting it, he was hurt, became emotional and angry.\n\nAdditionally, you are NOT wrong, because you made it abundantly clear you were only using his situation as an example and went out of your way to demonstrate that unlike him you didn't actually feel that way, and were actually very compassionate when he had cancer.\n\nYou could apologize, but why? If the situation were reversed considering how pig-headed he is being about being so obviously wrong, he'll NEVER do the same for you, and the fact that he cannot accept how wrong he is in this situation proves that.\n\nSince it's a small issue, I'd stand my ground as part of an overall effort to make him respect your valid opinions.

Bc it\u2019s one thing to go into \u201cmedical mode\u201d where you separate yourself like I just mentioned where you try to see something positive in a devastating situation & another to uncaringly blow it off like ehh she has 3 kids already, she\u2019s fine.

With everything he deals with, all the bad news he has to deliver, all the patients that could potentially die through no fault of his own, it is understandable that he would try to detach himself from them so he can continue to do his job, and even if it comes off as a bit callous, it's understandable due to his line of work.\n\nThat said, the person you were talking about was not his patient; it was his girlfriend's cousin.

It attaches the umbilical cord to tissue not designed for it and draws it's blood supply from other organs, which can cause life threatening damage to the mother. If it implants in the fallopian tube, it will eventually rupture the tube, which will cause the death of the baby and likely the mother. If it implants in the abdominal cavity, aside from damage the umbilical could cause, the growing fetus can damage organs as it grows, since it doesn't have the uterus to contain it. This can cause the death of the mother. The fetus can not be birthed naturally. Because of how the umbilical cord attaches to tissue, if a fetus could be carried to term without killing the mother, even if the fetus is removed through surgery the mother will almost certainly bleed to death. \n\n\nSource?

Very matter of fact, and that the pregnancy  was non-viable and life threatening from conception. But because it had happened, and a tendency toward it can be hereditary, my grandmother made sure that both her daughters and all her granddaughters that were old enough knew it happened and explained what it was. So if I was having a conversation about a terminated ectopic pregnancy, I'd probably be too frank about it too. Because that's how it's talked about in my family.

I wish you the best.", "I think most people understand that he wouldn\u2019t talk to patients like that but also that he shouldn\u2019t talk to his gf like that.", ">but what OP's describes BF doing is what EVERY SINGLE practicing physician does to some degree.\n\nAnd I agree!\n\nThey act like that to *some* degree, *while working*. \nBut OP's BF is keeping distance *in private*! He should not be acting like that.  He is her boyfriend, and OP was *very* clear she needed him not to act so clinical. \n\n>I tried many different ways to show him that he was being calloused , telling him he need to see things from a human POV and that yes this may be just another Monday for him but it\u2019s life altering for someone else.\n\n>His rebuttal was that it\u2019s his medical POV and he\u2019s not being calloused \n\nYet he was still unwilling or uncapable to differentiate. He doubled down on giving only  his 'medical POV'.  **That** is what makes him the asshole."]}
