You proved that despite his belief he was just being appropriately logical and rational his comments were lacking in compassion just as you said, because when you described his situation with the same sort of cold logic and rational thinking instead of accepting it, he was hurt, became emotional and angry.\n\nAdditionally, you are NOT wrong, because you made it abundantly clear you were only using his situation as an example and went out of your way to demonstrate that unlike him you didn't actually feel that way, and were actually very compassionate when he had cancer.\n\nYou could apologize, but why? If the situation were reversed considering how pig-headed he is being about being so obviously wrong, he'll NEVER do the same for you, and the fact that he cannot accept how wrong he is in this situation proves that.\n\nSince it's a small issue, I'd stand my ground as part of an overall effort to make him respect your valid opinions.

An ectopic pregnancy is never viable and basically a medical condition instead of an actual pregnancy.

Bc it\u2019s one thing to go into \u201cmedical mode\u201d where you separate yourself like I just mentioned where you try to see something positive in a devastating situation & another to uncaringly blow it off like ehh she has 3 kids already, she\u2019s fine.

With everything he deals with, all the bad news he has to deliver, all the patients that could potentially die through no fault of his own, it is understandable that he would try to detach himself from them so he can continue to do his job, and even if it comes off as a bit callous, it's understandable due to his line of work.\n\nThat said, the person you were talking about was not his patient; it was his girlfriend's cousin.

Also, which body part? These things matter when you're choosing to be flip about somebody else's cancer.\n\nAlso, maybe don't use somebody else's cancer to make a point.\n\nNobody's coming off great, here, but if your boyfriend's cancer had any potential impact on his ability to have kids (and let's face it, *his cancer was super recent*, so he hasn't fully recovered/integrated it)  I can understand that his private kneejerk reaction would be \"That's terrible.\" (Considers own situation, wishes it has happened after he had kids) \"It's good that she already had kids, though.\"\n\nThere's a pretty big difference between the implication of \"Meh, who cares? It doesn't matter, because she already had kids,\" and \"Shit, that's terrible for your cousin, but on the off chance that it does impact her future fertility, I'm glad she at least has her current kids,\" but not everybody expresses that difference very well. \n\nAlso, it sounds like your boyfriend expressed this only to you and not your cousin, correct? If so, nothing that he said has the potential to hurt your cousin (unless you tell her or other people, aside from the entire Internet), but what *you said* had the potential to hurt him. \n\nI'm not sure how that was a better strategy than just having an adult conversation.", "He didn\u2019t say them to your cousin, just to you privately. What kind of reaction were you hoping for, genuinely?", "The idea that dismissing a traumatising experience as \"she lost nothing\" because she had other kids is \"a medical opinion\" is ridiculous. \n\nI am an ex-vet nurse, current cancer PhD researcher,  and cancer survivor with a reasonable chance of getting it back. Ie: I have a lot of experience getting comfortable with death, medicine, and cancer specifically. \n\nHe. Was. Being. An. Arsehole. The fact he can't take with his stage 1 cancer is very telling. I fucking hope he isn't a doctor involved in addressing complex medical needs, because doctors with no compassion hurt people.", "If the boyfriend is 25 and had an actual body part removed and also had chemo, I'm not sure it's fair to ascribe a drama llama persona to him. \n\nI'm not a doctor, and most of what I know about cancer is \"Ugh, do not recommend,\" but that sounds like more than a lumpectomy or removing a sketchy mole.", "That's not what was said at all.\n\nEdit: Voice to text fix.", "Chemo is generally not that helpful for prostate cancer and it would be only be used right away if he had visceral mets.  My father has had his prostate removed, salvage radiation, two kinds of hormone blockers, and he would be doing chemo now if he didn\u2019t have a certain gene mutation but he\u2019s on a PARP inhibitor instead. His quality of life is pretty poor. But yeah, I\u2019ve never heard of first line chemo for early stage prostate cancer.", "When I read high survival rate, husband, part removed, etc I would guess testicular cancer too. \n\nHigh survival rate, surgery removes the testicle.

He could\u2019ve said it in a nice way to try to cheer up his girlfriend or he could\u2019ve meant it as an oh well too bad for her, in which case that\u2019s absolutely a dick move, but again without context there\u2019s no way to know which how he meant it.", "She knew what it was.

I\u2019m not aware of any early treatments other than removing the prostate with curative intent, unless things have changed in the 7 years since my father\u2019s diagnosis.  All the different kinds of medication are reserved for stage 4 and prostate radiation is not something to take lightly.
