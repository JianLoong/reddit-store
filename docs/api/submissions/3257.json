You proved that despite his belief he was just being appropriately logical and rational his comments were lacking in compassion just as you said, because when you described his situation with the same sort of cold logic and rational thinking instead of accepting it, he was hurt, became emotional and angry.\n\nAdditionally, you are NOT wrong, because you made it abundantly clear you were only using his situation as an example and went out of your way to demonstrate that unlike him you didn't actually feel that way, and were actually very compassionate when he had cancer.\n\nYou could apologize, but why? If the situation were reversed considering how pig-headed he is being about being so obviously wrong, he'll NEVER do the same for you, and the fact that he cannot accept how wrong he is in this situation proves that.\n\nSince it's a small issue, I'd stand my ground as part of an overall effort to make him respect your valid opinions.

An ectopic pregnancy is never viable and basically a medical condition instead of an actual pregnancy.

Bc it\u2019s one thing to go into \u201cmedical mode\u201d where you separate yourself like I just mentioned where you try to see something positive in a devastating situation & another to uncaringly blow it off like ehh she has 3 kids already, she\u2019s fine.

He was being a pompous jerk and minimizing someone else\u2019s pain but sure didn\u2019t like it when it was dished right back the same way.\nNTA", "That was exactly his point though, and he was completely correct with it. The cousin did not LOSE a pregnancy; this pregnancy was never viable and would have killed her and taken her away from her other already very much alive kids who need her.\n\nI commented elsewhere that if these people are in the US, then IF anything the cousin should be grateful that she was able to access she treatment that she needed to save her life and keep her with her children - at this point not a guarantee everywhere anymore.", "What was the timeline of all of this? It's not really clear from your post.\n\nDid your cousin have the ectopic pregnancy and in that discussion you brought up his previous cancer? \n\nOr did the thing with your cousin happen, then some time passes and when he gets cancer you do this sort of gotcha?\n\nBecause I think there is a big difference between using a 'hey remember when you went through that thing, what you're doing now would be like if I did x to you then' to prompt empathy and actually acting it out when he's going through something scary.", "It would have been better if you had phrased it as \"what if I said your cancer was easy and didn't cause you to lose anything.\" In the end, it's really hard to change people's perspective. You might be able to get him to think about what he said, but if that's what he really thinks and feels, you can't force him to have compassion that isn't there.", ">now have OP constantly taking very personal shots at him\n\nWhat gave you that idea?", "Jfc he gave YOU, not the cousin, an honest opinion.  So you kicked him while he was down to prove your petty point.  What if he said what he said to you, to your cousin instead?  Cause that's what you just did to him.  It's not the same and YTA", "Seriously tho. In the scenario of losing a child, I know this one girl who had a miscarriage. The dr there didn\u2019t even sedate her for the d&c. Then had the audacity to be like, \u201cPlease stop screaming. I don\u2019t like screaming.\u201d", "He never even spoke to the OP\u2019s cousin. The conversation was strictly between OP and her boyfriend. The cousin is none the wiser as to the words he said.  OP said the words directly to her boyfriend. So this is basically apples and oranges and yes Op is TA.", "Sadly empathy and natural kindness cannot be taught", "It absolutely has something to do with this discussion and it's not an \"over generalization\" it's absolutely been proven.", "Okay so you also are not getting it. Don't tell a woman who was pregnant and now is not pregnant that she didn't lose anything and she should be grateful she didn't die.", "Yet I definitely can tell the difference between talking to someone with empathy AND professional distance, and an asshole who doesn't give a damn. \n\nHe won't be able to hide it, his patients will know too.", "Then they should just break up because we can assume if they have a child and during the second has to go through the same procedure that he\u2019d feel the same and that she lost nothing.", "It would still be \"callous behaviour\" though. Calloused is more an actual physical change like \"calloused feet\".", "OP specifically said he was speaking from a medical perspective.\n\n> (if he\u2019s qualified to give it on this subject)\n\nHe doesn't have to specialise in the subject to be qualified to interpret and understand the corresponding diagnoses and their consequences.\n\nThat is literally the entire purpose of General Practitioners and emergency room staff.\n\n> \u2018there are great therapists that can help your cousin deal with her grief\u2019\n\nThat's not a medical opinion.\n\n>  \u2018people have an xyz% of still being able to conceive after an ectopic pregnancy\u2019\n\nOP doesn't have access to the specifics of the cousins case, it's inappropriate for OP to make such a comment.\n\nIt's also a statistic, not a medical opinion. Medical opinions contain interpretation and situational nuance.\n\n>  What he said was his callous opinion lacking empathy, not a medical opinion.\n\nHe was not talking to the cousin, he was talking to his girlfriend, there is no empathy to be had for the girlfriend.", "OPs boyfriend has a better understanding of the situation than you.\n\nYour comment is meaningless in the face of that.", "Half of Reddit consists of Highschoolers living with their parents - how do you expect them to understand the medical field?", "The post???? Read it", "Actually, empathy must be taught. One of the most unempathic beings around is a small child--they are totally self centered and focused. Many people even use this as an excuse \"They're five, they don't know better\" as the child yanks an animal.'s tail. Then when cat or dog finally give the child a taste of their own medicine by bite or claw, child screams and so does the parent. Little kids are often unempathic, terrible beings.", "He did not tell that TO THE WOMAN, he told that TO OP - very big difference.", "\u201cHe was not talking to the cousin, he was talking to his girlfriend, there is no empathy to be had for the girlfriend\u201d. So you should only show empathy when you\u2019re talking directly to the person involved? You\u2019ve never heard bad news about someone and said that you were sorry for them?", "Oh wow, what an enlightening answer!", "This is actually just a stage when they are that small, in moral development the child stays self centered until much later in life. They basically act the way they are supposed to for various reasons such as pain punishment avoidance, social repercussion avoidance, etc. people are born with empathy, the existence of socio/psychopathic persons who are born lacking are further evidence for this. \n\nhttps://www.simplypsychology.org/kohlberg.html#:~:text=Kohlberg%20identified%20three%20distinct%20levels,preconventional%2C%20conventional%2C%20and%20postconventional."]}
