You proved that despite his belief he was just being appropriately logical and rational his comments were lacking in compassion just as you said, because when you described his situation with the same sort of cold logic and rational thinking instead of accepting it, he was hurt, became emotional and angry.\n\nAdditionally, you are NOT wrong, because you made it abundantly clear you were only using his situation as an example and went out of your way to demonstrate that unlike him you didn't actually feel that way, and were actually very compassionate when he had cancer.\n\nYou could apologize, but why? If the situation were reversed considering how pig-headed he is being about being so obviously wrong, he'll NEVER do the same for you, and the fact that he cannot accept how wrong he is in this situation proves that.\n\nSince it's a small issue, I'd stand my ground as part of an overall effort to make him respect your valid opinions.

An ectopic pregnancy is never viable and basically a medical condition instead of an actual pregnancy.

Bc it\u2019s one thing to go into \u201cmedical mode\u201d where you separate yourself like I just mentioned where you try to see something positive in a devastating situation & another to uncaringly blow it off like ehh she has 3 kids already, she\u2019s fine.

Or do you want him to be sad that you are losing your appendix and panicking that he had better get the cuts correct and anxious about what happens to your life quality if he cuts the wrong thing?\n\nYour perspective - you were teaching empathy.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA.

Of course it is awful she suffered a loss, and yes it was a loss, but my perspective is that he was trying (badly) to spin the situation in a positive light. I.e. at least she has children to help ease the grief etc. \n\nNow, I may be biased here because I\u2019m one of those women that have had multiple miscarriages and no children. I understand cousin\u2019s grief. Yet, I still do not believe the husband was in the wrong here. If someone close to me at the time had said something like he did, I would have been upset. Understandably so. But that would have been the temporary grief. I would not have let something fester into a massive grudge and then turn that pain back on them. \n\nWe also have to remember that this is from OP\u2019s perspective. She will spin this a certain way because of how she felt in that moment. We\u2019ve all been there, perhaps exaggerating to prove a point. Differences of opinions happen. Hurt feelings happen.

I also had an ectopic pregnancy last year and it was awful and traumatic and literally the most horrific thing I've ever experienced. At my post op appointment, my OB hugged me and told me that she's so glad my appointment was in the morning when it was because had it been later in the afternoon the outcome could have been a lot different. I am also in the medical field and have been for eight years. I've seen some wild things but I would NEVER trivialize any experience a patient is having, no matter how \"small\" it may seem to some. Anyone who does should not be in the medical field because that is a horrible attitude to have.", "ESH. Of course he shouldn't have said what he did.

It was extremely childish and heartless.", "ESH - lack of empathy  for the trauma that another individual going through. OP in the context of her BF. BF in context of the lady who lost her babies.   \nBeing a medical person myself who on regular basis has to break the most terrible news a person has to hear about the loved one, you do dissociate yourself emotionally from the case where you have to make decision based on medical perspective. That itself doesn't remove the empathy which an integral part of communication skill for a health professional.   \n\n\nThere's often times when i'm de-briefing/venting to my non-medical husband about my workday where i can sound callous, no empathy to a stranger who doesn't know me or the context of my rant. Which why it only occur in my own safe space - a partner who knows i'm not an A\\* who doesn't care about my patients, sometimes it just the reality of a situation and no way to sugar coat about it.

No chemo at all and still cancer free. \n\nThe cancer was super tough but the ectopic tore at my very soul.

Speaking to the cousin he would be a massive asshole for what he said but that's not so for speaking with OP. \n\nWhereas you now have OP constantly taking very personal shots at him over something that was never personal in the first place. Yeah, that's not going to kill their relationship at all......\n\nReddit has a very perverse notion of compassion. He's probably met OPs cousin once, yet in discussion with OP alone he's supposed to fawn over the cousin like \"Oh no! I'm so so so sorry, I can't believe that happened! Oh my gosh that's such a shock. I hope she's going ok during this so very difficult time to her. Nothing could beat that. I hope she's staying above water. I couldn't imagine that happening\".\n\nFeigned sympathies are perverse.\n\nI was once party to a conversation where the 4 of us in it had just met and a dude brought up his mother dying 6 months beforehand \"I'm not saying this for sympathy but...\"; the next 20 minutes of conversation consisted of repetition of the phrase \"That's so hard\" and \"I'm so sorry\".", "My husband can act like this too, when he is talking to me and is speaking his opinion. \n\nI think he is not very emphatic when it comes to these kind of sensitive topics. He sees things from a logical perspective and while I agree with things he says, I don\u2019t think that his opinion is a kind one. He never, ever, voices his opinion towards someone who it might hurt. And his opinion will change when he experiences the situation irl and can empathise with the person in real life. \n\nWith hypothetical situations he is the most un empathic person. But the moment these situations gets talked about by someone who has personal experiences about the situation he is able to see their pov and change his opinion. \n\nI, on the other hand, am very emphatic and don\u2019t feel okay to judge without really knowing how things might feel for me if I were in that situation. So I don\u2019t think her bf lacks empathy. I think he feels very comfortable around his gf that he allows himself to talk openly about his internal opinion without having a social filter. Because my husband is in context with others very empathetic and takes their views very seriously and would never tell them if he even slightly has a different opinion. \n\nI hope I might have changed your mind about this. I struggled with my husband sharing his honest opinion and asked him many questions, tried changing his mind and once asked if he would tell this to the person that struggled with a situation. \u201cNo ofcourse not!\u201d Was his immediate reaction. He looked disgusted by the prospect. So yeah I think he can be an unempathic dick with his opinions.

Also, for the sake of patients, we're moving to more of s biopsychosocial model instead of a strict biomedical model. Patients feel more supported and do better when their personal life factors are taken into account. \n\nA miscarriage is hard even if it wasn't going to be a viable fetus. That doesn't change the positive pregnancy test or the excitement. I can only imagine the sadness of not having the baby you desperately wanted of your loving partner after leaving an abusive one. \n\nThis is simply to telling a parent with multiple children who had one die that its not that bad because they aren't childless.

Ectopic pregnancy is definitely serious as it's a life threatening condition and absolutely can impact fertility. Most of the time it occurs in the fallopian tube and they just remove the pregnancy tube and ovary with surgery because it's the quickest and safest route.  A lot of women only ovulate from one ovary in the first place. It's life threatening because it can cause the tube to rupture and the pregnant mother can bleed to death. It can also impact the other tube if too much internal damage is done or issues with surgery.  Most of the time Ectopic pregnancy is caught when it's about to rupture or almost ruptured.", "Yeah.
