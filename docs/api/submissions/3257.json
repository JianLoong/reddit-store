Hopefully it will make him a better medical-field guy (nurse or doctor or whatever he is). A doctor without compassion or empathy is basically like a mad scientist. Medicine is about people- period.  It's literally not about anything else, it about fixing people, easing their pain, and helping them. If your comments help him to understand that, then he and the rest of the world are better off for it.", "NTA. It's the \"she didn't lose anything\" comment that really does it for me - that's not a medical POV, that's just being a jerk. And it's funny that he got so irate when the logic was flipped on HIM.. it's like, oh, so now it IS an insensitive comment? Jeez.. and this guy is out there working with patients. -\\_-", "> He got mad and told me I\u2019m minimizing his struggles\n\nthat's pretty ironic lol. NTA I'm sorry for your cousin.", "I'm gonna go with ESH... but there's a good probability I would have done the same thing you did ;-)", "NTA. He can dish it, but not take it. Think before you speak or don\u2019t speak at all, sir.", "NTA. He was being a dick about your cousin and had zero empathy.", "NTA. and i would like to have seen his face when you flipped the convo", "NTA and you proved your point extremely well. You proved that despite his belief he was just being appropriately logical and rational his comments were lacking in compassion just as you said, because when you described his situation with the same sort of cold logic and rational thinking instead of accepting it, he was hurt, became emotional and angry.\n\nAdditionally, you are NOT wrong, because you made it abundantly clear you were only using his situation as an example and went out of your way to demonstrate that unlike him you didn't actually feel that way, and were actually very compassionate when he had cancer.\n\nYou could apologize, but why? If the situation were reversed considering how pig-headed he is being about being so obviously wrong, he'll NEVER do the same for you, and the fact that he cannot accept how wrong he is in this situation proves that.\n\nSince it's a small issue, I'd stand my ground as part of an overall effort to make him respect your valid opinions. If you don't, caving when you are right could create a future in which he feels comfortable disregarding your opinion when you are clearly correct while he expects you to accept he is always right, even when he is wrong. ;-)", "JFC you two should break up. ESH except the woman that lost her child.", "ESH. All medical issues should be treated with compassion. I know you were trying to teach him a lesson, but you did exactly what your BF thought he was doing. Him being in the medical field, he probably wants to distance himself emotionally from people he doesn't know well. Being overly emotional in that type of field will just drain the life right out of you.\n\nBut you are his GF and he got cancer. Just like your cousin depended on you for support, he was depending on you for support, not a judgmental attitude. So, while he was an asshole for not explaining things properly in wanting to distance himself emotionally from what was a traumatic experience for someone he isn't close with, you are also an asshole for not being a person he could count on, since you were his person.", "I think you need a new bf. He lacks empathy. Of course your cousin wants a baby with the good man she has now..... not to mention the grief of loosing your babies!", "NTA. Turnabout, as they say, is fair play. I know that medical personnel need to have some detachment, but they also need to have some compassion. Sounds like your bf is kinda lacking in that department.", "ESH. \n\nI doubt that he would have been as cold and clinical when talking to your cousin; he was talking to you and expressing his medical opinion.  He thought he could be honest with you. However, when you started telling him he sounded callous he should have acknowledged your point of view and hopefully explained that he isn't that direct when talking to patients. \n\nThat said, I think it was kind of mean of you to turn it around and bring up his recent cancer. He's obviously sensitive about that (as evidenced by the social media emphasis) and he took it as a personal attack.", "NTA. He is TA. Good for you for sticking up for your cousin. Honestly, you should evaluate your relationship. He didn't get the message when you used his logic on his situation, how do you think he will treat you if it's you going through something?? I'm not in the medical field but I can imagine you have to keep a \"textbook\" sense about you to get through some of the things they deal with on a daily basis but he needs to flip a few pages and find the chapter on the human aspect of these medical facts. It's sad he acts like a robot toward anyone but himself. I would consider that a red flag and proceed with caution.", "I've had a kot of experience on the receiving end when it comes to doctors and medical care. Some can be really compassionate and great at what they do. Then there are the cold fish ones. Seems like bf is the latter. Once in a while, we would like to have a doctor who actually has the capacity to at least seem as though they care. It helps in the overall healing process, as I've come to realize. NTA. Get rid of him asap and get with someone who cares instead of analyzing everything from a clinical pov.", "Ew, ESH. At least your cousin didn't have to listen to someone diminish her experience to her face like you did to your boyfriend.", "INFO: Is your boyfriend actually a medical professional? Cause if he isn't, he can take his \"medical opinion\" and cram it straight up his backside... next to his head.", "Your cousin lost twins, he was a jerk about it. He gets cancer, you call him out. He\u2019s not a saint, but it seems like you were looking prove a point. No such thing as an easy cancer, friend, and minimizing what he went through is no better than what he said about you cousin. Only difference is he had to deal with something that happened to him while you were only indirectly impacted by both instances. YTA", "NTA. The only way I can be charitable to him, especially if you guys live in a red state, is that he's learned what ectopic pregnancies mean and is ready at the drop of a hat to defend medically necessary abortion.  If he actually literally thinks miscarriages mean nothing at all, then you definitely should not have kids with him.", "He's technically right. An ectopic pregnancy is never viable and basically a medical condition instead of an actual pregnancy. No child could have come from it, she basically lost an egg in the most complicated, dangerous way. But being right doesn't excuse jackshit. It doesn't mean it wasn't traumatic, she still had to let go of a fantasy in a horrible way, she still suffered through a dangerous medical condition and 'some people have it worse' isn't a reason to deny someone empathy.\nIs there a certain suffering threshold she's gotta cross to be deserving of his compassion?\nEven if he didn't give a damn about her (which.. okay if they don't have any kind of relationship) she is important to you and as his partner he should at least respect your emotional investment instead of turning someone elses experience into some kind of pain Olympics.\nYou did well to hold up a mirror to him and I hope he'll learn from this. \n\nNTA", "NTA or at least I find it a justifiable act that probably will keep you from holding onto this for a long time.\n\nBut can I just say I hate the premise of when people feel like they need to have new babies with their current spouse? This is not to make her loss any lesser, because it absolutely isn't, but it's just a trend I kind of think leads to favoritism and sometimes, loads of children from many fathers (not that that's what's happening here).", "Why are you with this creep?", "YTA.\n\nIt is never, ever okay to use someone\u2019s cancer as a weapon, a tool, a debate tactic, etc.\n\nYou do see the hypocrisy here, right?", "NTA but title is misleading! you merely showed him life from his pov, you didn't minimize his struggles just because you think so. good one and stand your ground on this.", "ESH. What the heck were you hoping to gain by going down the trauma competition rabbit hole? Just\u2026no. Stop.
