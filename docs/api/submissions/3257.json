Hopefully it will make him a better medical-field guy (nurse or doctor or whatever he is). A doctor without compassion or empathy is basically like a mad scientist. Medicine is about people- period.  It's literally not about anything else, it about fixing people, easing their pain, and helping them. If your comments help him to understand that, then he and the rest of the world are better off for it.", "NTA. It's the \"she didn't lose anything\" comment that really does it for me - that's not a medical POV, that's just being a jerk. And it's funny that he got so irate when the logic was flipped on HIM.. it's like, oh, so now it IS an insensitive comment? Jeez.. and this guy is out there working with patients. -\\_-", "> He got mad and told me I\u2019m minimizing his struggles\n\nthat's pretty ironic lol.

He was being a dick about your cousin and had zero empathy.", "NTA. and i would like to have seen his face when you flipped the convo", "NTA and you proved your point extremely well. You proved that despite his belief he was just being appropriately logical and rational his comments were lacking in compassion just as you said, because when you described his situation with the same sort of cold logic and rational thinking instead of accepting it, he was hurt, became emotional and angry.\n\nAdditionally, you are NOT wrong, because you made it abundantly clear you were only using his situation as an example and went out of your way to demonstrate that unlike him you didn't actually feel that way, and were actually very compassionate when he had cancer.\n\nYou could apologize, but why? If the situation were reversed considering how pig-headed he is being about being so obviously wrong, he'll NEVER do the same for you, and the fact that he cannot accept how wrong he is in this situation proves that.\n\nSince it's a small issue, I'd stand my ground as part of an overall effort to make him respect your valid opinions. If you don't, caving when you are right could create a future in which he feels comfortable disregarding your opinion when you are clearly correct while he expects you to accept he is always right, even when he is wrong. ;-)", "JFC you two should break up. ESH except the woman that lost her child.", "ESH. All medical issues should be treated with compassion. I know you were trying to teach him a lesson, but you did exactly what your BF thought he was doing. Him being in the medical field, he probably wants to distance himself emotionally from people he doesn't know well. Being overly emotional in that type of field will just drain the life right out of you.\n\nBut you are his GF and he got cancer. Just like your cousin depended on you for support, he was depending on you for support, not a judgmental attitude. So, while he was an asshole for not explaining things properly in wanting to distance himself emotionally from what was a traumatic experience for someone he isn't close with, you are also an asshole for not being a person he could count on, since you were his person.", "I think you need a new bf. He lacks empathy. Of course your cousin wants a baby with the good man she has now..... not to mention the grief of loosing your babies!", "NTA. Turnabout, as they say, is fair play. I know that medical personnel need to have some detachment, but they also need to have some compassion. Sounds like your bf is kinda lacking in that department.", "ESH. \n\nI doubt that he would have been as cold and clinical when talking to your cousin; he was talking to you and expressing his medical opinion.  He thought he could be honest with you. However, when you started telling him he sounded callous he should have acknowledged your point of view and hopefully explained that he isn't that direct when talking to patients. \n\nThat said, I think it was kind of mean of you to turn it around and bring up his recent cancer. He's obviously sensitive about that (as evidenced by the social media emphasis) and he took it as a personal attack.", "NTA. He is TA. Good for you for sticking up for your cousin. Honestly, you should evaluate your relationship. He didn't get the message when you used his logic on his situation, how do you think he will treat you if it's you going through something?? I'm not in the medical field but I can imagine you have to keep a \"textbook\" sense about you to get through some of the things they deal with on a daily basis but he needs to flip a few pages and find the chapter on the human aspect of these medical facts. It's sad he acts like a robot toward anyone but himself. I would consider that a red flag and proceed with caution.", "I've had a kot of experience on the receiving end when it comes to doctors and medical care. Some can be really compassionate and great at what they do. Then there are the cold fish ones. Seems like bf is the latter. Once in a while, we would like to have a doctor who actually has the capacity to at least seem as though they care. It helps in the overall healing process, as I've come to realize. NTA. Get rid of him asap and get with someone who cares instead of analyzing everything from a clinical pov.", "Ew, ESH. At least your cousin didn't have to listen to someone diminish her experience to her face like you did to your boyfriend.", "INFO: Is your boyfriend actually a medical professional?

He\u2019s not a saint, but it seems like you were looking prove a point. No such thing as an easy cancer, friend, and minimizing what he went through is no better than what he said about you cousin. Only difference is he had to deal with something that happened to him while you were only indirectly impacted by both instances. YTA", "NTA. The only way I can be charitable to him, especially if you guys live in a red state, is that he's learned what ectopic pregnancies mean and is ready at the drop of a hat to defend medically necessary abortion.  If he actually literally thinks miscarriages mean nothing at all, then you definitely should not have kids with him.", "He's technically right. An ectopic pregnancy is never viable and basically a medical condition instead of an actual pregnancy. No child could have come from it, she basically lost an egg in the most complicated, dangerous way. But being right doesn't excuse jackshit. It doesn't mean it wasn't traumatic, she still had to let go of a fantasy in a horrible way, she still suffered through a dangerous medical condition and 'some people have it worse' isn't a reason to deny someone empathy.\nIs there a certain suffering threshold she's gotta cross to be deserving of his compassion?\nEven if he didn't give a damn about her (which.. okay if they don't have any kind of relationship) she is important to you and as his partner he should at least respect your emotional investment instead of turning someone elses experience into some kind of pain Olympics.\nYou did well to hold up a mirror to him and I hope he'll learn from this. \n\nNTA", "NTA or at least I find it a justifiable act that probably will keep you from holding onto this for a long time.\n\nBut can I just say I hate the premise of when people feel like they need to have new babies with their current spouse? This is not to make her loss any lesser, because it absolutely isn't, but it's just a trend I kind of think leads to favoritism and sometimes, loads of children from many fathers (not that that's what's happening here).", "Why are you with this creep?", "YTA.\n\nIt is never, ever okay to use someone\u2019s cancer as a weapon, a tool, a debate tactic, etc.\n\nYou do see the hypocrisy here, right?", "NTA but title is misleading! you merely showed him life from his pov, you didn't minimize his struggles just because you think so. good one and stand your ground on this.", "ESH.

And it's not healthy to compare struggles or create a sort of hierarchy but UNDOUBTEDLY the cart blanche attitude people have wrt the \"cancer card\" is shitty. \n\nAnd this is extremely prevalent inside the cancer survivor community as well, where you have someone who had Stage 0 Breast Cancer, had no chemo, minor localized surgery and tries to tell someone they \"cured their cancer with diet and lifestyle changes.\" OP's bf is going all in on the cancer warrior persona and cashing in those pity points and demanding that his struggle be respected when he obviously doesn't have enough empathy for someone else.\n\nESH: OP's move was an asshole move but IMO it was excusable and not out of a place of cruelty.

One thing that rings to what they always told me thats easy to reference for people.\n\nScrubs.

Essentially saying those family members won't be going to work tomorrow and will mourn the loss. The Drs have to go back to work tomorrow dealing with more of that.", "I agree with you about how being in the medical field you have to sometimes set aside your emotions & look at a situation based on the medical info vs the emotional aspect bc you see so many heartbreaking situations that it will wear you down. \n\nMy biggest question here is, in what context did the boyfriend say these things & what was his attitude when he said it? Bc it\u2019s one thing to go into \u201cmedical mode\u201d where you separate yourself like I just mentioned where you try to see something positive in a devastating situation & another to uncaringly blow it off like ehh she has 3 kids already, she\u2019s fine. And if OP was upset at the time (understandably) it\u2019s very possible she mistook his words to mean that he didn\u2019t care when really he was just trying to comfort her in that way that you do by showing someone the bright side of sad things. Bc whether you\u2019re in the medical field or not it\u2019s very natural when people are upset you try to cheer them up. \n\nSo I can totally see OP being like yeah my cousin lost her babies, it\u2019s so sad, she really deserved to have more babies now that she\u2019s finally in a good relationship\u2026.. & her boyfriend trying to show her the positive side to cheer her up & being like yeah but she has 3 kids already, she\u2019s very lucky bc at least she has them, I\u2019ve seen people with this issue that don\u2019t already have any kids & then bc of this they can\u2019t have them now or it\u2019s very difficult for them to conceive\u2026so like he may\u2019ve been coming from a good place, it just wasn\u2019t want OP wanted to hear at the time.\n\nI\u2019m not going to give judgement bc I think the context of the conversation is needed first. I however am not a fan of OP comparing her bfs cancer to an ectopic pregnancy. Even if he was in fact being shitty about her cousin that comparison was below the belt & disgusting bc there is absolutely nothing positive that can be said about having cancer.", "How's she an asshole? Because she flipped it around and showed him how callous he was coming across? Dude's a medical professional for god sake, if anyone should know how to be empathic it should be him.

He wants empathy for himself while lacking empathy for others.", "OP said she told her boyfriend, not her cousin.", "He had absolutely none for her, that's far from \"too much.\"", "Yeah but once you said it out loud to him, it's going to forever seem like that's what you really think of his cancer."]}
