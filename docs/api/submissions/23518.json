If your dog reacted negatively it could have ended badly. Also shame on this mom.

Dogs are allowed to go places and don\u2019t have to be okay with just anyone and everyone invading their personal space. If you had relented and your uncomfortable dog had even growled or snapped, that woman would have thrown a fit. Autistic children are challenged interpreting social cues. I would imagine reading a dog\u2019s cues would be even more challenging. What if you allowed the kid to pet your dog, then the child tried to hug it? The outcome if your dog had bitten this kid would probably be euthanasia for your dog. \nI call BS on people telling you that you shouldn\u2019t have brought your dog into the store. You know your dog. You know their limits. You protected their boundaries. \nWell done.", "NTA.  I feel awful for the kid, but not letting a stranger pet your dog is the best choice here since you were considering the safety of everyone in the situation. The situation could have overstimulated your dog and the dog barking could have scared the kid. It was best to place that boundary. It's important for the child's mom to enforce that it's important to respect others and their boundaries because it's an important life lesson and not doing so could place the kid in dangerous situations too. This is also an important experience because in the future they might come across a service animal or an untrained animal and it's important for the child to know that there are situations in which it's not appropriate to pet dogs. Furthermore, it was right of you to consider the safety and well-being of your dog. Of course, the child is not at fault whatsoever, it's just that his mom should have been more respectful and less entitled in this situation. I hope she takes the time to work through this with him, so he does not get hurt and is better equipped to handle situations like this in the future.", "NTA, I\u2019m sorry for her son but that\u2019s her fault for letting it escalate in such a way. She needs to find ways to manage her son\u2019s condition that don\u2019t involve harassing people and animals. My dog is not very comfortable with strangers, if a screaming lady approached me in such a way he would probably get very defensive or attack her and he\u2019s massive, he could easily kill a person. \n\nYou said that your dog was large too, so this lady was willing to endanger her son because of her own foolishness. Crazy\u2026", "[deleted]", "NTA  \nYou absolutely handled this well. Your dog, your rules. This whole \"my kid is \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ and should have their every whim catered to...\" is nonsense. This kind of stuff is just bad parenting on the parents part. They don't enforce boundaries and rules because their kid is neurotypical, and think that every whim should be catered to them, even by strangers. They asked, and you said no. No is a complete sentence.", "YTA. Not because you didn\u2019t let her pet your dog- but for bringing your dog who does not like children in public store where children are present. It takes ONE incident for a child to be injured and for your dog to be forced to be put down. ONE. You are being a severely irresponsible pet owner for bringing a dog that doesn\u2019t do well around children in public spaces with children. Additionally inside a store with aisles and no large spaces to keep away from others.\n\nEditing to add: OP, you are not treating your dog well. You clearly state he is \u201csuper uncomfortable\u201d around children. And keep putting him around children. He is communicating with you through the only way he can- his body language. And you are completely ignoring him. You are ignoring your dog telling you what he needs from you as an owner.

You are solely responsible for your dog's comfort. The mother is responsible for teaching her son to navigate in public and that he doesn't get everything he wants. If your dog reacted badly to the boy, he would have been a lot more traumatized. Mom was way out of line. You chose the safest method of dealing with the situation.", "Definitely NTA. The entitlement of some people is absolutely disgusting.", "NTA. You handled it perfectly, even if the outcome was chaotic. You protected your dog, the child, and yourself. Be proud of yourself for standing your ground and removing yourself from the situation.

But when it comes to children she gets uncertain a lot and it really depends on if she wanna say hi after I tell the kid to get down on her level and let her choose.

No you\u2019re not the asshole.", "NTA. If she knows her child is autistic it's her responsibility to communicate with him in a safe way what's happening around him. He will survive this. Your dog is a large dog and animals can get reactive around crazy shit, so if you did let the kid pet your dog after the crying started, it would have been way more likely that something could have happened. Unthinkable.", "NTA. Your dog has its own personality and needs. If the dog doesn't like children, then you can't just override what the dog will tolerate. It's its own sentient being with wants, needs, likes, dislikes. Imagine if she came up to strangers asking if her son could pet their hair. It is absolutely the same thing. It's also weird not to take a no. Her son is autistic, not stupid. There's a difference between disability and telling a child \"no\". If the child throws a fit, my guess is they don't hear \"no\" very often and ***that*** is the problem, not you OP.", "You literally chose the best option for both your dog and the child. The mother harassed you.", "NTA\n\nHer son needs to learn not all dogs can be pet.  Your dog could have easily been a service dog.\n\nDogs who behave poorly should not be out even in dog friendly stores, but this is not that situation.  He behaves fine just doesn\u2019t like being crowded by kids, reasonable.  I don\u2019t like it either come to think of it.", "NTA and I once heard a trainer compare a dog to a loaded weapon - it is capable of going off and even if you have the safety on there is danger.

I am not saying your dog would do this but using is as an example. My son has scars from a friendly dog that decided he should not be walking across the street from where the dog's female owner was getting into a car in their driveway. You must do what you can to protect your dog. \n\nJust because a child wants to pet a dog, that doesn't mean they should. I mean, does the mother expect a service dog to be petted? Yes, it is beyond words hard to explain to a child with autism something like this but you have to and I speak as a mama to a now adult with autism.", "NTA.

The mom is an entitled AH.", "NTA\n\nI feel bad for everyone involved here because she clearly knew that saying \"no\" was going to result in a meltdown and she was desperately trying to avoid it.

You should feel bad for her, but you are NTA.\n\nI guess I am a little curious why you bring your dog to stores (even dog friendly ones) if he can't be around kids without risk of injury? From your description this isn't a service animal. Kids are unpredictable and one could run up to you at some point without you or the parents realizing. Seems like an unnecessary risk to take them into a confined space like a store. Not all dogs are able to be in human spaces.", "You are definitely NTA", "NTA.

What is wrong with people? NTA", "NTA. Not in the slightest. If anything, you were doing the mom and kid a favor for not letting them pet your dog. You knew he might react poorly, and guess what, if he did exactly what you warned her he may do- she could sue you for X and win. \n\nMaybe you could've explained that your dog doesn't do well around young children, but she- a grown woman, should understand and take no for an answer.", "NTA, i have sympathy for parents with special needs children. But it is still important for that child to learn boundaries esp since his condition makes it hard to understand them in the first place.  Imo, you could have said \"no my dog is not good with children\" just for a little more context. You do not owe a stranger that but logically this is what I would do.", "Can you imagine how upset the mom would have been if OP had given in and something happened on the interaction that scared or hurt her child? Not necessarily a bite as that isn\u2019t what the OP seems to indicate was likely\u2026but maybe even just a rapid jerk back or a movement that knocked her boy over?", "Spoken as someone who has clearly never worked in the service industry.

Where did you read that?", "She very clearly had the dog on a leash and has even said the dog wears a Do Not Pet harness.", "Not liking kids and being uncomfortable around kids are two different things. An uncomfortable dog isn't inherently aggresive-it may choose to leave the situation rather than lash or, or just gets skittish and needs some time to destress. If there's no history of aggression, it's reasonable to assume that an incident isn't likely to happen as long as it's being handled correctly. Besides, even dogs who are good with kids can injure a kid if the kid pushes it too far.", "Honestly I'm not going to entertain this comment or anything similar, and no one else on this thread should either.  It's ridiculous to tell someone that they shouldn't take their dog in public on the small instance that a child might be there. I know my dog 100% and know his limits and how he should be handled and this way of thinking just shows how completely ignorant people are about dog behavior and training.", "The dog is fine and trained. It just doesn't like to get touched by random people, seems alright to me", "I can't wait to tell Spaghetti he is a loaded weapon.", "She has specifically said that he\u2019s never bitten or so much as snapped at a child but is merely uncomfortable. Nothing about that even remotely suggests risk of injury. Why shouldn\u2019t she go out in public with her dog?

It's just a dog who doesn't like to be touched by strangers, especially small jumpy strangers. \n\nI would say the better question is why a person would bring their child to a pet store knowing that if they couldn't pet a dog they saw, they might melt down. My kids weren't allowed with me in dog parks or pet stores until I knew they would ask before petting and respect a 'no' answer.", "Well he isn't aggressive and he is super well behaved, so I feel comfortable taking him to stores. It's pretty far and in between that we go however. We were walking back from the park and I realized I needed a couple things from the pet store, so it was easier for us to just swing in. He wears a DO NOT PET harness and I actually haven't had any issues with kids running up to him.", "Idk why are you are acting like the mother didn\u2019t set her and her son up for failure in this particular case. Why would you set up the expectation of \u201cbeing allowed to pet every dog\u201d for a child who clearly has a hard time with change of routine. Is being a parent hard ? Yes. Are we allowed to just call out failures like this as we see them ? Hell yeah. Kid shouldn\u2019t have to feel like a burden or like his world is falling apart just because mom decided suddenly we CAN pet every dog. That was never going to happen. Op actually gave them their first dose of cognitive therapy. Mom would be smart to follow suit. Excusing actions like these very quickly turns into enabling.", "The dog can be around kids just doesn\u2019t like being approached by them. Not in a way that makes him dangerous, just stressed. Liking to play with kids isn\u2019t a prerequisite for a dog being allowed in public. They just have to be able to be controlled in situations. Same with loud noises. They don\u2019t have to like or be unphased by loud noises\u2026they just need to be able to be controlled when the load noises happen. There was no indication that OP lost control of her dog at any point", "You are the only reasonable person in this comment section.

I get pushback about \"Oh well my child is good with dogs, he will love him.\" So I've just started saying no, and it's not safe.", "Is he uncomfortable with kids or are you uncomfortable with him being around kids, and he is responding to your change in demeanor/emotions?\n\nI don\u2019t ask this as an accusation. I had a large dog. Sweetest, goofiest 100+ pounds of goober you could ever meet. He snapped at a kid in our neighborhood one day when I was walking him. Two boys, probably 10 years old, ran up on us. I got nervous because I wasn\u2019t confident about how my dude would react. One of the kids tried to pet him, and he snapped at the kid. Didn\u2019t bite him, thank god, but I think we all shit our pants a bit. \n\nI got him home and couldn\u2019t stop thinking about what could have gone differently, both good and bad, and I realized that the moment I saw those kids making a beeline for us my anxiety skyrocketed. My dude was very protective, and I honestly feel that he was mostly reacting in step with my emotions. \n\nI never walked him again after that. Not because I didn\u2019t trust him so much as I didn\u2019t trust myself. We had a big enough yard that he could get plenty of exercise at home, and I wasn\u2019t willing to risk anyone\u2019s safety again. \n\nAnd you\u2019re definitely NTA regardless.", "You learned something important in this episode - your friend has lamentable judgment.\n\nNo one is entitled to pet your dog.", "Yeah I get it, I would feel bad for the kid too, but at the end of the day you know that you did the right thing.

I said in spaces where you are going to be in close proximity to children, like stores. You are literally ignoring your dog telling you things OP.

You are IGNORING YOUR DOGS BODY LANGUAGE.", "No, she says the dog is \u201csuper uncomfortable\u201d around children. She knows this by his body language. Because the dog can\u2019t speak. The dog is telling her that he doesn\u2019t like it. Yet she keeps putting him in situations where he is uncomfortable.

Except they shouldn\u2019t be- like OP shouldn\u2019t be shocked when her dog hurts a child. Dogs don\u2019t speak. They communicate through body language. OP has clearly stated that her dog is \u201csuper uncomfortable\u201d around children. OP keeps putting her dog in a situation where he is super uncomfortable, and clearly communicating to her he does not want to be there. It takes literally one time and one quick child for this to end in tragedy.

The owner knew full well his dog should not be in there because I heard him whisper to his wife moments before he lunged at a poor dog. I grabbed my dog as soon as I heard him and before I could even say anything, they unhooked his leash to \"try it out. Maybe this time it will be okay...\" A dog in my building freaks around other dogs including mine and yet the owner keeps them off leash in the hallways so I'm always nervous to turn the corner. Everyday I walk my dog I see owners improperly walk their dogs, doing everything you are not supposed to do. It's not unreasonable to be curious.", "Also a good question! I'd say parents of severely autistic kids often stop thinking rationally because it's like a mini war every day. Imagine never being able to properly connect with your kid, never being able to satisfying them, or fully communicate, imagine the exhaustion parents normally feel and then quadruple it. If petting dogs is the one time you can see your kid calm and happy and you have never been told no before, you might not be thinking of the potential downsides to taking them to a dog store. \n\nI'm overly sympathetic because I have a friend whose kid is very similar. Idk what it is with dogs and autistic kids but it can be very special. Dogs are one of the only ways they connect to the world and everything else is kind of a nightmare of constant landmines and setbacks.", "Fair enough! Seems like you are doing everything right.", "You are 100% NTA and in the right op!\n\nMy boy had 12 years of being the quietest most loving dog ever, kids, old people cats, other dogs etc..\n\nOne day a a local who couldn't control his dog allowed it to run off into our yard, where my boy was off doing quick number one.\n\nOut of nowhere my little Manchester terrier/jack russel cross had his jaw clamped around the gentlemans region of this larger dog. (owner threatened to sue but I may or may not have threatend to introduce my foot to his rectum)\n\nTook him to the vets for a check up as this behaviour was well out of the ordinary and turns out he had a brain tumor that caused the change. Unfortunately my best mate since I was 8 had to be put down for his own good.\n\nThe only thing that I can hold onto is that it wasn't somebodys child! Putting your kids in that sort of situation should mean you cede responsibilty for them as you're obviously not best suited for the job.", "I've said everything about where I am coming from in previous comments so I'm gonna tap out and not repeat myself. \n\nI never said the mom did something right.

It still awful and makes no sense to bring your dog to a place where kids are likely to be around. If it\u2019s that bothered by children.", "You\u2019re the second person to mention \u201ccontrolled\u201d as if I argued that was the issue. \n\nOP said her dog get \u201csuper uncomfortable\u201d whenever a child approaches. Why would they (or anyone) think it\u2019s okay to put a pet in a position to be unnecessarily uncomfortable? The dog behaving doesn\u2019t change the fact that it\u2019s uncomfortable. Just makes the dog the most reasonable party in this situation.", "The it\u2019s not safe is perfect", "Ah gotcha. Yeah that sucks when being upfront and honest doesnt work. Either way you are fine. That kady is not being a good parent doing stuff like that to her son. Happens with non autistic kids too. The parents are entitled then make their kid flip out trying to get sympathy. Mad world we live in!", "He isn't comfortable around kids. When he was a puppy someone's child scared him really badly and from then on he has just not wanted to have anything to do with them. I do think it was a failure on socialization after that for my part. I don't have any friends or nearby family with kids so he just wasn't around them, so other than that one negative reaction during his socialization period, he hasn't had any positive experiences with kids.", "That\u2019s not true at all. The dog was uncomfortable so they left. That\u2019s textbook appropriate behavior.", "Yeah, and plenty of parents are terrible parents. So? This story was black and white and you made an undue and ridiculous judgement on OP that somehow they were doing something dangerous despite absolutely no evidence of that. That\u2019s gross.", "I know what you mean, I don't want to come off as unsympathetic. I just think there are better ways to make sure kids get that kind of experience. Even a very well-behaved dog could bite if cornered by a child who isn't respecting boundaries. That's not fair to the child or the dog. \n\nMy son doesn't have autism but he's not neurotypical. Animals are 100% his best coping mechanism and form of therapy. His ferret sleeps with him every night. I know it can be really, really hard to be autistic or parent an autistic child. I just don't think a pet store is safe for a child who can't handle not being able to pet any specific animal he sees.", "Yeah that\u2019s just an excuse you are making, she had many dog meetings before this to get her shit together dude. She doesn\u2019t need you to excuse her blatant mistake. Your excuse doesn\u2019t even make sense in this situation. Not calling things like they are just makes it worse for everyone in the long run. Which is why you keep getting called out.", "You said that she was an asshole because she shouldn\u2019t bring her dog into a store because her dog doesn\u2019t like being pet by strangers/kids or like loud noises.\n\nThat is where you are wrong. If her dog is well controlled he should absolutely be allowed to go for the store with her. The only thing that made this an issue was this woman not respecting boundaries.", "You asked why OP would put their dog in a position to be around kids or loud noises. The comment above made some really good points, you're just not reading them.\n\nOP was in a dog friendly store. Just because kids can sometimes be in those stores, doesn't mean the kids MUST have access to pet your dog. \"No\" is a complete sentence. There is usually no pterodactyl-level screeching from children in stores, either. Your points are asinine. OP did the right thing by protecting her dog's comfort because dogs don't give a fuck whether a kid wants to cling on them or not, and you can't explain to a dog that \"it will only be for a second\". Furthermore, if there is ever a way to get a dog to bite your kid,  interacting with it while their child is screaming at the top of their lungs after the owner already told you \"no\" is a great way to do so.\n\nSo I'll make a counterpoint: why did the mother set her autistic child up to fail by going into a pet-friendly store and magically expecting strangers to let her kid interact with unfamiliar dogs?", "Okay. Well we still need to go out in public. There are kids at the park and in the neighborhood when we walk. I get where you're coming from but if my dog isn't aggressive then it's not like I can just lock him up forever and never go out with him.", "Because they can? Why shouldn\u2019t they go out in public? The dog was perfect fine until it wasn\u2019t and then they left. That\u2019s normal and appropriate behavior.\n\nFirst, in this (and every other situation), the parent should have been actually parenting to avoid this happening in the first place meaning her dog wouldn\u2019t have been uncomfortable. Second, once OP realized the situation was becoming unmanageable, they left and took the dog away from a potentially uncomfortable experience. There\u2019s no issue. \n\nWhy can\u2019t you understand that? I was once at a concert that was a blast but then I ended up being crammed against the gate at the front because everyone behind me was pushing forward. It was making me uncomfortable so I left. You\u2019re saying I shouldn\u2019t ever go to concerts because sometimes they can escalate to uncomfortable levels rather than just doing something, monitoring my comfort levels, then readdressing the situation as it changes. That\u2019s dumb and wrong.", "You obviously missed the part of the post where the mother asked if her child could approach and OP said \"no\". (I.e. the whole reason for the meltdown in the first place).. *that* was OP making sure her pet was not in a position to be uncomfortable, because she told the mother the child was not to approach or pet her dog. You need to work on your reading comprehension.", "Aaawww that\u2019s understandable. I just wanted to put my experience out there because it wasn\u2019t something I had ever even thought about until it happened, and in my case it wasn\u2019t that my dog didn\u2019t like kids in general, he lived with kids so he was used to them, it was just my own reactions. \n\nTo be a bit fair to myself though, he outweighed me by 20lbs at that time. He listened well most of the time, but I knew if he ever really wanted to go after something, cat, squirrel, kid, whatever, I wouldn\u2019t be able to do shit to stop him. That underlying fear was the main reason I quit walking him.", "She should not be bringing the dog into areas where it will have to be in close proximity to children at all. Stores are included in these. Yes it sucks, but you know what sucks worse? Her dog snapping one day after trying to communicate time and time again- and then it is at risk for being put down. Dogs are animals and are unpredictable especially when they are clearly uncomfortable. Why in the world would you ever risk a situation in which you are putting children and your dog at risk.", "Again, it was a follow-up question that was answered for me after I said NTA. \n\nAnd the evidence is my daily encounters with dog parents who are not very well informed on how to be dog parents. I do not know OP. OP answered me and added the details like a harness that says Do Not Pet and the fact that it was a pet store (a detail they left out as they had just written \"dog-friendly store\") that makes me think they know what they are doing and are definitely NTA.\n\nDon't really know why that is \"gross.\"", "Again, you\u2019re arguing points I didn\u2019t make. Let me help you.\n\nOP said her dog is uncomfortable whenever a child even approaches it. I never said she shouldnt bring her dog in public. I asked why she would bring her dog to a place where kids are. A dog being \u201ccontrolled\u201d is irrelevant to the fact that the dog is still uncomfortable. It\u2019s shitty to make a pet uncomfortable.", "The point were good, just not relevant to anything I wrote. OP didn\u2019t say that their dog was only uncomfortable when pet by kids. But the mere presence of kids \u201capproaching\u201d makes it uncomfortable. Which I why I questioned bringing the dog to a place with kids. The store being pet friendly is not relevant. The AH piss poor mother is not relevant. Put another way, if dog is uncomfortable around clowns, don\u2019t bring it to the circus. Doesn\u2019t matter how behaved the dog is, it\u2019s still likely to be put in an uncomfortable position.", "Never implied that your dog should be locked away. Far from it. I will admit I\u2019m lucky to live in a city big enough and with sufficient pet friendly / no children options.", "As I\u2019ll say for the last time, never said the dog shouldn\u2019t go out in public. Said they shouldn\u2019t go to places around children. Two different things\n\nI never defended the mom. Not sure why you keep bringing her up. She was shitty, but the dog shouldn\u2019t have been in a store with kids around. Specifically because OP said the dog gets nervous by simply being around kids. Let alone being pet by a child.\n\nPlenty of people don\u2019t go to concerts because they can\u2019t handle crowds or noise. Just like people afraid of heights don\u2019t get on roller coasters.

Also unlike a dog, I hope that you\u2019d be able to use your words if you were in an uncomfortable situation.", "The very first paragraph from the OP said that their dog is \u201csuper uncomfortable\u201d around approaching children. So taking a dog to a store with children around was a problem. The interaction with the shitty mom is not what I\u2019m arguing. It\u2019s irrelevant.

Besides the socialization with kids thing (just because I didn't have any smart options) we got our training down!

When I think of what it would look like for a dog to actively dislike children, I think of growling, snapping, things like that. Whereas I view an uncomfortable dog to be more timid, more frightened, more prone to getting awya than attacking. \n\nBut okay, for argument's sake let's say there's no difference. You do realize that dogs have different reactions to things, right. Let's take fireworks. Most dogs don't like fireworks. But they don't all react the same. Some may have a barking fit, others may run around, and others prefer to hide. \n\nSo when it comes to dealing with kids, if your dog is non-aggressive and prefers to hide or get away instead of attacking, then it's relatively safe for the dog to be in public. \n\n>An uncomfortable dog always has the option to snap, especially after being repeatedly put in uncomfortable situations.\n\nBut so does a dog that's good with children. For starters, *any* dog could snap when repeatedly being put into stressful circumstances. And even the most calm, gentle dogs can be quick to defend themselves depending on the situation.

Only OP knows all of that, and make a judgement on how often to bring her dog out to those places based on that. If it was something where the dog got very upset often whenever they went out, yeah, of course that should be avoided.

I also can say that I am dubious of people's judgement when it comes to their dogs. I regularly see people taking their dogs places that aren't pet friendly.

Barring a situation like what just happened, it's usually pretty easy to see when someone is trying to approach your dog. A lot of ppl nowadays are conscientious enough to ask for permission, and most parents won't allow their children to approach a strange dog. So if OP can usually keep her dog feeling safe, I see no issue. \n\n>OP is just willfully putting her dogs in places he has told her he doesn\u2019t like.\n\nI mean, most pet owners will have to deal with that at some point or another. Obviously, there's necessarily medical treatments and general care. But I knew a dog who didn't like going potty when it was raining or had just rained bc she didn't like her paws getting wet, but she needed to go (small dog, small bladder, couldn't wait hours to go) and so she had to accept it every now and then. \n\nI also think it'd be kind of sad if the dog otherwise really enjoyed their times out but didn't go bc it could maybe get a little uncomfortable for a few minutes. \n\n>Difference in how we regard our pets and value their feelings I guess.\n\nThis is a weird take, imo. No one, human or animal, can avoid being uncomfortable our whole lives. Of course, a good parent or pet owner would want to avoid extreme and/or constant cases of their pets and kids being uncomfortable, but I think we can all accept that facing some instances we don't like is just a facet of life. To say OP shouldn't take her dog out to any child-friendly locations (which rules out a *lot* of places depending on where you are) just to avoid moments of the dog being uncomfortable feels a bit overwhelming. So if the dog loved going to the park and spent 2 hours being happy and 3 minutes feeling uncomfortable, in your eyes the pet owner doesn't value their pet?", "Except you don\u2019t fucking know.
