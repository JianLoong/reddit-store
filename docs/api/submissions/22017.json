When we met I was in a very vulnerable place in my life. I had lost everything through addiction, had gotten out of jail four months prior and had a three month old son, and my father had just died. I was homeless, jobless, and had only been sober a little over a year. My husband hadn\u2019t been in a relationship since before I was born, he is incredibly smart but has a lot of trouble connecting with people. He treated/treats me and my son great, I fell for him fast and things moved incredibly fast. He has been a father to my son, the only father my son knows. \n\nThe problems came after the honeymoon phase wore off and I realized the effects long term isolation had on him, which is way too much to unpack here.  He experienced severe trauma as a child then again as a teenager. Instead of working through his trauma, he shut people out. By the time he was ready to settle down and have a family, he had been shut out so long, he no longer knew how to connect with people. He is one friend, his brother, and his parents, and that\u2019s it. This has caused big problems in our marriage. He doesn\u2019t include me in major decisions, he ignores and dismisses me when I raise any concerns with him (literally ignores me and acts like I never said anything), and I literally have to tell him the same things every day. If I leave him, he will never move on and who wants someone they love to be alone the rest of their life? \n\nOur major problem is he constantly picks and digs in his skin. At any given point he has open sores all over his body (arms, neck, face, etc). No exaggeration I will tell him to stop picking and a minute later he is back to picking at an open sore. He literally sits on the couch for hours EVERYDAY picking and digging in his skin. He will stand over the stove cooking and picking at his skin. I no longer share a bed with him because he will get blood all over the sheets, every single shirt he owns has blood on it. I no longer allow him to wear my hoodies or shirts because they will be stained with blood by the time I get them back. There is literally blood everywhere. \n\nThe worst is when he does this in public, it is embarrassing for me. The last few times we have been in public and I see him picking, I have loudly asked him to stop and I could tell it really embarrasses him, but he won\u2019t do it again after I embarrass him. I feel bad because it seems like something he can\u2019t control but I am close to divorcing him over it. I don\u2019t just call him out on picking, I make a scene about it and the embarrassment tends to get him to stop until we are in the car heading home. So AITA for embarrassing him in public?

Telling him to stop won\u2019t make him stop. It\u2019s a compulsion he has and he can\u2019t stop. Bringing it up in public to embarrass him doesn\u2019t help the situation and just makes you an AH for shaming him for something he likely can\u2019t control. It sounds like he could use therapy and the two of you could as well. If you truly care about him you will help him get help.", "He is probably doing it to self soothe or as a compulsion, something that he either isn't aware of or cannot help. He needs to get help (I doubt this is something he's interested in, but he does need to). YWBTA if you continue to embarrass him.", "Compulsive picking (excoriation disorder) is a mental disorder - maybe as a result by anxiety, ADHD, OCD etc. (It's on the obsessive/compulsive spectrum generally). Given that you say he has trouble forming and maintaining friendships and is prone to isolation, there could be more to it also (certain medications can make you more prone to pick too). Trauma manifests in varied ways.\n\nAs a former addict who experienced homelessness, did you find public humiliation helpful? If your past hasn't taught you some empathy for the human condition, I'm not sure what to say.\n\nAre you unhappy in the relationship in general or just with his picking? If the former is causing you the most frustration, then make an appointment with a specialist and attend with him - literally drive him there. There's an element of anxiety and embarrassment attached to these things, especially for a man his age who isn't used to talking about himself/his issues. \n\nWhile it's frustrating to see someone pick at themselves to the point of bleeding and scarring...it's no different to someone having any other mental disorder. Imagine telling an addict or a depressed person to just *stop*. Would it work?", "YTA. Are you 10 years old? This is a private conversation, not a public spectacle. Have some decency.", "INFO: How did you fall in love with someone you are clearly so physically disgusted by, and did your desperate situation have a hand in you overlooking all this until you were in a more secure position?", "YTA. Instead of trying to get this guy therapy you loudly embarrass him infront of people. No wonder he isolated himself", "YTA- No wonder!  You straight up said he has trauma and isolates himself and SELF HARMS himself, and  your idea of helping is humiliating him. And before you say \"I've tried\" ... BS!!! Your HUSBAND... the person you swore you wanted to love and build a life with SELF HARMS! This isn't about you and the image in public. This is a serious (possibly subconscious) cry for help. Now, you have made yourself so unavailable and an \"unsafe space\"  for him that he's not going to open up and let you help or help him find it either.", "I compulsively pick my skin. The single thing that\u2019s helped me is the med Luvox. Your husband needs therapy and a psychiatrist ASAP. If he won\u2019t get help and refuses to stop bleeding everywhere in public I\u2019m honestly gonna say NAH. He\u2019s deeply ill and you don\u2019t want to be bled on. Sorry this is something you\u2019re dealing with.", "YTA. Instead of yelling at him you need to get him help. But I can also understand  that you might not have any experience with his situation.\n\nHe suffers from a form of dermatillomania, specifically excoriation disorder. There are actual triggers for him picking. There are ways to cope with this. Fidget toys are supposed to help. You don't want a traditional therapist either, but one that specializes in behavioral therapy. \n\nMy source is that I suffer from this as well, specifically trichotillomania. I tend to pick on my scalp. My triggers are stress and boredom. I haven't seen a behavioral therapist myself, as therapy is expensive, but have done extensive research. I'm also a very mild case. \n\nThe trick is to being able to recognize your triggers and coming up with a reaction plan. For me it's stopping and asking myself if I'm stressed or bored. If I'm stressed I will do some journaling or meditation, asking why I am stressed, or do another activity that helps destress. If I'm bored I will find another activity to do,or find a family member to distract me. I tend to be an introvert outside of my family.  There are medications available as well, like antidepressants to help calm the mind.  In case you're wondering my bald spots are slowly disappearing, there are some ups and downs, but I celebrate the wins.\n\nThere's probably a subreddit for this, there's one for trich. If you look up the definition and have your husband read it, I bet he'll be shocked at how much the symptoms mirror his own. I went through a period of time wondering what was wrong with me and doing research, it doesn't help that my trich also coincides with an actual scalp condition, but when I found the diagnosis it was like a light bulb went off. The problem is society doesn't talk about the out of norm mental disorders or they generalize it to the point where you don't realize something qualifies. This falls under OCD, by the way.", "YTA. It sounds like this guy literally saved you. You say he can't connect with people, and he ignores you, but the worst possible example you can think of is that he picks his skin too much? Have you thought about how it must feel to have someone repeatedly tell you what to do with your own body?", "YTA", "He needs immediate psychiatric care, if there's blood everywhere and he has open sores all over his body. What do his parents and brother think? Does your husband have a job?", "So your logic was yelling in public would fix it?\n\nYTA", "Just divorce already. You two aren\u2019t compatible or happy clearly.", "You should look up dermatillomania. It's a mental health problem, and it needs to be treated as such. Getting annoyed at him and making him feel embarrassed or bad about it is likely to just make it worse due to anxiety or nervousness. He may stop temporarily, but it might be causing him a lot of distress to do so. He needs mental health support and you need to look up how to help him get it and techniques he could use to lessen him harming himself. Show him compassion.\n\nI am also concerned about him not involving you in major decisions. Is this in relation to the skin picking or a separate issue? If it's not to do with skin picking you should probably have a conversation about that as well. \n\nYTA - you not understanding what's going on is acceptable, however you not trying to understand and deliberately hurting his feelings, embarrassing him and causing him distress definitely is not. You're knowingly making him feel embarrassed and that is never okay", "ESH and frankly you the most for being with this man. I can't imagine this is actually a good environment for your child. The ignoring of you and dismissing you is insane. And your reasoning for not leaving him sounds abusive.\n\nBut you're deciding to be with this man. If you don't want to be with him picking his skin, and he won't/can't stop, then you either have to accept it or move on. The fact that he won't get help clinches it for me.", "Info- what does his doctor say about this?", "If he\u2019s not willing/able to get help, try a chain mail fidget.

He's not stupid. He knows he picks his skin. He doesn't need you to tell him, and other people don't need to know. \n\nHe's TA for everything else. You should seriously consider divorcing him at this point. He's not willing to do the emotional work of having a real adult relationship and he's not willing to go to therapy to try to better himself. This isn't a relationship at this point, it's a hostage situation, one where you feel you can't leave lest *he* be alone. Staying for his sake isn't fair to you, and it's only enabling him.", "I think everyone else is being a bit harsh on you (and also ignoring the literal blood everywhere), it sounds like you've made a lot of effort to help him but this is the only thing that has had any effect so I understand why you're doing it, but it probably won't help in the long run.\n\nI saw you've taken a day off work to make sure he goes to a doctor - it sucks you have to do this, but it shows you really care and I wish you luck with it.", "YTA\n\nThis is 100% self soothing.

It is not your responsibility to wait around and be miserable if he refuses help.", "NAH you\u2019re justified in feeling the way you do, but shame is not helpful.\n\nHe needs therapy.
