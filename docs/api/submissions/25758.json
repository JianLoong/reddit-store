I just don't want my wife and I to live in the same house anymore.\n\nMarried 6 years. We have a 7y/o daughter, hers from a previous relationship, but who is 100% my daughter and knows it. About a year in, my wife started \"seeing\" another man, and when I found out about it, I begged her to stop. I didn't want our family to be destroyed. After a few false efforts, she finally stopped communicating with him. It took a good year before she regained my trust. Then we married.\n\nFew months ago I found out my wife was having a new \"emotional affair\" with a different man. I confronted her, broaching divorce, so she promised to stop all contact with him. Last Friday she came home very late after claiming to have been out with some of her work gfs, though she went \"dark\" right after her shift, which was counter to our agreement after the initial affair came to light: if I were to rebuild my trust in her again, I'd need total transparency. That night I got none.\n\nLast night she again came home very late and passed out on the couch. I saw her phone, saw she'd installed Snapchat, and read a couple snaps that the man under a false username had sent her - one was a selfie that said, \"I didn't know dancing with you would make you so wet.\" I felt sick. I realized that Friday night she had actually gone to the bar with him.\n\nAgain I confronted her about the affair, and told her I wanted a divorce. Part of me wished she would just stop, but she couldn't promise she would this time. I told her I'd be moving back to my mom's for a bit, and she and our daughter could stay in our house until she figured out alternative living arrangements for herself. It is my intention to stay in my daughter's life because she does not deserve the instability that's coming.\n\nMy wife doesn't want her to know that anything's wrong. She tried to convince me that an open relationship with her would be better than divorce, but I've made that very clear that's not for me. She then talked coparenting: her idea, we'd live together, parent together, put on a face like nothing's wrong. But I don't want to watch our daughter while my ex-wife goes out on dates or stays out all night barhopping. My wife works nights as a waitress and bartender. I work from home as a software dev so the majority of my girl's time when she's not in school is with me.\n\nI don't want to ruin my daughter's life or bring her sadness, but I do not want to live with my wife. This will completely destabilize my child's life, as neither my wife nor the person she's had this affair with are remotely capable of maintaining the lifestyle I've provided for them. I don't want to bankroll this woman any longer, as I pay all of our bills: her money goes only toward daughter's tuition, and whatever else she wants to buy.\n\nWIBTA if I do not want to continue to live with my cheating wife, but instead would rather be open with my daughter about our separation, get my wife out of my house as soon as humanly possible, and let my daughter know that I'm 100% still her father?", "created_utc": 1693279482, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/164746i/wibta_if_i_refuse_to_coparent_with_my_cheating/", "score": 74, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You need to find a therapist, support group to regain your confidence and self worth.  Until you understand how horribly you've been beaten down and disrespected, how can you possibly coparent? I get and understand your desire to stay for your daughter, but look at it this way - you are teaching / modeling for your daughter how a marriage is supposed to work.  Would you want her staying in a relationship where her partner cheats? The best and hardest thing to do, is usually the right one. You need to leave or have your wife leave.

Ultimately these kinds of pretend for the kid end up also messing up the kid because it's so confusing when they parents do divorce. Or it just gives them a toxic model that marriage is just two people who hate each other but never talk about it.\n\nUltimately your wife's solution is not about your daughter.

We kept putting it off because we'd been trying desperately to pay off our debts so we could buy a new home closer to our daughter's school, and from our calling around we found it would cost $1000 or more for a lawyer to handle the paperwork. We had a brief legal battle with my daughter's abusive and unhinged biological dad nearer the beginning of our relationship because she was so worried he would try to press for some custody and I hired a lawyer for her to help put her at ease, but all that did was scare the guy into saying he'll sign over the rights. Our lawyer back then did send paperwork to his family (he lives several states away) but never got an answer, and we just sort of let it go because the lawyer was so expensive. We were talking about getting it done just literally three days ago. I believe she will still let me adopt her after this, because she knows how much of a positive force I've been in her life.", "These past few months have truly beaten me down. My self confidence is shattered, and it becomes increasingly difficult to convince myself that it's her failing and not mine that has caused the dissolution of our marriage.

Consult with your lawyer, move back and pack her stuff and place outside the home and change the locks. Good luck!! You are NTA.

May I also suggest that if you\u2019re able/haven\u2019t already done so, you need to formally adopt your daughter? In the event things get ugly, you have parental rights as her father that you may not have as her (technical) stepfather. Again, this depends on where you live.", "This is on me: she'd mentioned coparenting and described the idea that we'd continue to live together as though nothing were wrong for awhile, but I want to be away from her immediately. I could barely look at my kid today without crying my eyes out and I was relieved when she finally went to sleep so I could come and get this all off my chest.", "You are absolutely entitled to be mad at her. And I'm sorry this is happening to you. \n\nYou will have to coparent. That's not optional if you want to remain present. However! Strict boundaries and expectations are the best ways to ensure minimal contact with the wife. \n\nAlso, the kid will find out what happened. Current age may be too young to grasp it (a child therapist would know best) and lying to her is a sure fire way to create trust issues. So you being aware of wanting to make sure the kid knows what's going on is the better options (versus pretending otherwise).\n\nGood luck.", "Hey dude. Give yourself time to process. I'd get a therapist if I were you. But you also really need to dump the woman.\n\nIn short. The wife isn't able to provide you with the emotional support you need in a monogamous relationship.\n\nAnd trust me on this to. If she tries to get the girl out of your life, her daughter will resent her.\n\nYou can probably legally fight for her in the court system. But you can probably kick your wife out without kicking your daughter out.\n\nI'd talk to a lawyer before making any moves though. Be totally clear on what you want with the lawyer. Take picture of the phone and any other evidence you can of the affairs.\n\nYour wife sounds like a jerk. If it was a man doing these horrible things, reddit would slam him. Instead it's a woman so all the redditors are just gonna be gentle in their approach.", "I hope the soon to be ex sees it that way too.

Of course this will beat you down and destroy your self esteem and self worth.  Normal people will go down a path of being introspective - where was I lacking? What could I have done differently? Etc.  That means you are a good person with normal responses.  Please believe that. You know what normal people do who feel something is missing? They seek couples therapy, talk to their partners and put their kids above their own needs.  And if nothing else, they show enough respect for their partner and family by leaving.  She took away your choice and used your feelings and daughter as leverage.  I've been there.  It's going to hurt and suck for awhile BUT I promise you, it does get better.

Stay in house with daughter as suggested. Good luck.", "He is not. He lives several states away and is difficult to track down. Last we communicated with him, he expressed willingness to sign over his rights. I will try to get that legal ball rolling prior to the divorce.", "Oh yah that\u2019s hard he may not be awarded custody. I didn\u2019t see that sentence. He needs to put his own mental health first in this situation"]}
