I can now be more present and a better mom to my child, and for that, I\u2019m incredibly grateful. AA has quite literally saved my life and if anyone who is reading this struggles with addiction, I just want to say there IS a way out - you just have to know YOU ARE  WORTH IT and SOBRIETY is worth it. \n\nMy first post ended up being a mixed bag in terms of judgements about my assholery. I accept my judgment of being the AH but I did want to clarify a common misconception. Abstaining from alcohol is just a small portion of AA. A much larger portion is dedicated to is looking into WHY we drink, take accountability for our selfish actions and apologize accordingly and to rectify our character defects so we can be better ppl to our friends and family. Because of these aspects, I was hoping exposing my son to the program would teach him something about accountability, patience, and empathy. \n\nI ended up just asking my AA home group if it bothered them that I brought my son to meetings. Not only did everyone look at me like I grew a second head for even asking for permission, every parent in the group talked about their own children growing up in AA and how \u201cyou do what you have to do to stay sober.\u201d Essentially, the consensus was that it is far better for a kid to have to be dragged to meetings a few hours a week than to have a mom drunk all the time.\n\nI still take my son to AA meetings, but now I allow him to play on my tablet with headphones. (I got reamed in the comments for not allowing my kid to do this before. Fair enough. I just have this \u201cthing\u201d about kids being on technology as a quick fix for boredom, but I need to get over that.)\n\nMy son gets a lot of treats and gifts from my home group members. One dude gives him $10s and $20s every time he sees my son (I know, right? Untapped resource!). My son is learning how to play electric guitar, and two AA members will rift with my son and talk music (Jimmy Hendrix is currently my son\u2019s hero). All in all, my son likes the attention and says he doesn\u2019t mind going to meetings.\n\nA surprising update in all of this is that my son\u2019s dad has stopped drinking. (Although he currently refuses to attend AA). My relationship with my ex is much better and my kiddo seems much happier as a whole.\n\nLife for all of us is just\u2026 better. And while I don\u2019t want to turn this into a public endorsement for AA, I just want to say that sobriety is hands-down the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to my family.", "created_utc": 1681160273, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12hvzpl/update_aita_for_forcing_my_7yearold_to_go_to_aa/", "score": 1581, "replies": ["You should be incredibly proud of yourself for the work you're putting in!

I wasn\u2019t as worried about your son being at the meetings (I had to attend a few at exactly the same age and it didn\u2019t scar me for life, if anything it gave me empathy and I learned anyone can stumble. Rich, poor, etc.). I was worried about how the other folks would feel to have to censor their shares. But you say they are fine with it so I guess keep doing what you have to do to stay sober. \n\nI get everyone\u2019s reactions to this but honestly being a part of my mothers journey to sobriety was positive for me. I saw her with my own eyes pick herself up, dust herself off and get well. She didn\u2019t make excuses she just did the work which I saw so I believed she would get better. And I was lucky she did. It would be nice if you could find a meeting with care and a playroom or maybe this could be a project you spear head. You can\u2019t be the only parent. We had those as well and that was also nice bc I got to meet other kids that understood what I was going through bc they were going through it too.

Your son is already exposed to your sobriety journey, I\u2019m adamant that he should not be exposed to other stranger\u2019s sobriety journey as well. No child should have to grow up going to AA meetings. He\u2019s 8. He doesn\u2019t understand right now what those meetings are.

They have even eased up on the high power stuff in a lot of the meetings bc many folks are atheists. My mother went to AA and it saved her life. She did it consistently for a year and then stopped but she never drank again for the rest of her life. Some people go for life bc it\u2019s basically free group therapy. Some people go for a while, some on occasion for maintenance, some just a few times but still manage to stay sober. It\u2019s a safe space and has been proven to help folks get clean. It\u2019s why it\u2019s recommended by doctors and in patient programs are covered by insurance.

They got sober when I was 9 and I grew up with AA, the community formed through that. The birthday nights were some of the most special times that stick in my memory. Also, many of us ACOA (adult children of alcoholics) have skewed relationship with alcohol, family, relationships and so on--but not because of AA, rather the disease of alcoholism. You're right, 20 years down the road life looks different. But fuck addiction. Fuck what it did to my family. It's the addiction and abuse of alcohol that fucks up kids and families. You're welcome to not like AA for yourself but help me understand what horror AA is for children and not the actual addition itself?", "> Tell me one cult or religion for that matter that follows suit?\n\nEVERY cult or religion will tell you outwardly it does things like that, that all donations are voluntary, that people can leave whenever they choose.

And I learned a lot. It helped me not to just be angry at my mom for her addiction, but to have compassion and know that she\u2019s trying her best. It\u2019s an opportunity for your kid to learn about humanity, responsibility, consequences, compassion, etc. It will also likely benefit your relationship with him as he will see you taking responsibility for your actions and being accountable. \n\nMy father was also an alcoholic who unfortunately died from his addiction when I was in middle school.

I agree with your points about not being scarred for life, learning empathy, and seeing up close the journey of a parent becoming and staying sober. Most of my memories of going to AA meeting as a kid, though, are of the great toy rooms we got to play in because the meetings were usually in the basement of a church.

Plus, we made other AA kid friends!", "I'm a child who grew up going to AA meetings with my mom because she was getting sober. We usually played in another area of the room and didn't really hear much of the detailed conversation. As far as the religious aspect goes, there is an element of a higher power, but how much weight each AA group gives that kind of depends on the community where the AA group is. Experiences vary, but from what I heard and saw as a child through an adult (I'd go to the birthday meetings to support my mom), the religious thing is pretty light-touch. It's not a cult, and was certainly less religious than the few times I went to a catholic mass. \n\nI know there's a lot of criticism of AA, but I have had a better life because I had a parent get sober through it, and I know many, many other people who have been able to achieve sobriety through it, many of whom could not have done it if the program required any payment.", "There are secular versions of AA that can be found online.

Yes, there are online meetings for other programs, but OP has said that the in-person element is important for them. So that\u2019s that.\n\nI\u2019m not saying AA is perfect. But I am saying that it still does work for a lot of people. OP got slammed by a lot of those comments in the original post. Did she give up? No. Did she pick up the bottle? No. She took all of that feedback, and kept trying to find a way to make it work for not only herself and her son, but her whole group! \n\nI just\u2026OP is doing some really hard work right now.

I could bullshit either of those probably but it wouldn't be genuine so what good would it do? \n\nWhat I hate even more about AA is how they ram down your throat how powerless you are over your addiction. Fuck that. I caused my own addiction (with genetics probably playing a large part) and I fixed it, not some fantastical higher power. My parents and some great friends helped me along the way, but I don't consider that a higher power either. I guess all I'm saying is that for some AA is absolutely wonderful, for others like myself, it fell very short of helping. What helped me was a rational, science based curriculum of virtual meetings. What is wonderful is that more and more choices for help are becoming available.", "Former / returning AA member chiming in here:\n\nIf these were open meetings, then I supposed it's allowed technically. But why force a kid at that tender age to sit in a room full of people recounting their struggles with addiction? This is not just \"going to church\" this is going to AA. This is not only unfair to the child involved but the other members who might be holding back on their commitment to be completely honest and open. They may fear that what they need to share is not appropriate for a 7 year old to hear and having been in AA, there is no shortage of things discussed that could qualify as this. This is dangerous, because people in AA are often not there for \"self improvement and amends\". They're there to try and save their lives from a disease that kills many many people every single year.\n\nI am all for recovery and using AA as a tool - a vehicle to get there. But I don't think it's in any way appropriate for group members to bring their children there, except on rare occasions where the whole family might come to support a member on their sobriety milestones (birthdays).\n\nSome members may be responding positively, but I wonder how many have not and may even have left the group.\n\nSorry, but I don't think this is appropriate. I am going to say YTA but the correct words are \"misguided\". Church is great for kids but AA is not Church. AA is not designed to be preventative medicine for 2nd graders. I can see it if a teen has a problem with drinking, but Alanon is the best place for people who are not drinking. And I don't believe any 12-step room is an appropriate place for little kids.\n\nOne AA once told me that he wished everybody could be an alcoholic so they too could become as spiritual and awesome as we were. It was probably one of the most arrogant, misguided things I have ever heard in my life.", "> I ended up just asking my AA home group if it bothered them that I brought my son to meetings. Not only did everyone look at me like I grew a second head for even asking for permission\n\nI feel like there would be a lot of pressure being asked this and it would be difficult to answer honestly because I wouldn\u2019t want to make the mom or kid feel bad or look like a jerk in front of everyone.\n\n> Essentially, the consensus was that it is far better for a kid to have to be dragged to meetings a few hours a week than to have a mom drunk all the time.\n\nI mean, yes of course, but those shouldn\u2019t be the only two options.  I thought the general consensus of the last post was to find a way to attend meetings (even if virtually) while also not exposing your son to this or making the other AA people have to censor themselves for him.\n\n> I still take my son to AA meetings, but now I allow him to play on my tablet with headphones. [\u2026] I just have this \u201cthing\u201d about kids being on technology as a quick fix for boredom, but I need to get over that.\n\nYes, you do need to get over that.  Dragging him to the meetings is one thing, making him sit there silently and listen to it all because you have some weird personal hangups with technology is worse.\n\n> A surprising update in all of this is that my son\u2019s dad has stopped drinking. (Although he currently refuses to attend AA).\n\nThat\u2019s great.  Sobriety is awesome, but I think a lot of people avoid AA for its Christian cult aspects and its other criticisms.  Especially those with religious trauma (that may have contributed to their drinking), they really aren\u2019t looking to dive back in and give the church control of their lives again.  So they find alternative ways to sobriety, which are valid too.", "Okay, great update and all, but ... it's JIMI, not Jimmy!

I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any other parents in your group but what the AA group that I was around as a kid did was they had days where parents were encouraged to bring their kids and pool resources to hire a babysitter who could watch us! There\u2019d typically be only 4 or 5 of us, it was fun to play together and splitting the cost was more affordable for parents and paid enough where even just one or two hours worked was enough income for the babysitter.

In fact, mine was probably least shitty set of parents in the entire group but I felt comfortable there. Our counselor was a great guy and having a space that I was able to share my frustrations in without having judgements passed was a great thing. I attended the program all 4-years of high school. The program he curated really helped make things easier for me and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d have made it to graduation without it. \n\nTwo of the other people I was in the program with (a brother and sister) also had a shitty home life and neither wanted to end up like their primary care-giving parent.

I was in it for the free donuts and all the adults loved having me around, I was quite the rambunctious kid and made friends easily, so I loved all the people there and they were nothing but kind to me.\n\nAlso, maybe it's different now, but all the meetings I went to had an optional \"kid play area\" with toys and stuff, so I didn't always even sit in the meeting room. I think when topics were heavy my grandma would send me there, but it's hard to remember, and I don't want to discount people's negative memories and experiences with hearing things they shouldn't have at a young age.\n\nPersonally, I think attending those meetings DID give me a sense of empathy and understanding for people from all walks of life. It taught me that life is messy and hard,  but there's always hope for recovery. That was also just my grandma's life philosophy though; she was an incredible woman who spent the last 35 years of her life sober after being an alcoholic for close to 15 yeats. She helped so many people maintain sobriety I miss her every day. For her, AA worked, and maybe it doesn't for everyone, but sometimes simple things like celebrating each day sober as an accomplishment can really help people feel hopeful and like they're making progress.", "My mum was an alcoholic when I was OPs sons age, and the guilt and fear associated was wild.

Insurance companies don\u2019t want to take the risk of unknowingly covering the cost of a group that doesn\u2019t actually promote recovery.\n\nAA\u2019s rigidity and its expectation of strict adherence to the programme are part of the reason *why* the programme is so successful. \n\nIt is very, very difficult to overcome an addiction. Allowing an addict to have too much freedom and \u201cwiggle-room\u201d in regards to their recovery process makes it all too easy for them to spiral back into their addiction. The expectations need to be clear and non-negotiable.\n\nThe rigidity and structure of AA also provides a psychological safety net.
