I can now be more present and a better mom to my child, and for that, I\u2019m incredibly grateful. AA has quite literally saved my life and if anyone who is reading this struggles with addiction, I just want to say there IS a way out - you just have to know YOU ARE  WORTH IT and SOBRIETY is worth it. \n\nMy first post ended up being a mixed bag in terms of judgements about my assholery. I accept my judgment of being the AH but I did want to clarify a common misconception. Abstaining from alcohol is just a small portion of AA. A much larger portion is dedicated to is looking into WHY we drink, take accountability for our selfish actions and apologize accordingly and to rectify our character defects so we can be better ppl to our friends and family. Because of these aspects, I was hoping exposing my son to the program would teach him something about accountability, patience, and empathy. \n\nI ended up just asking my AA home group if it bothered them that I brought my son to meetings. Not only did everyone look at me like I grew a second head for even asking for permission, every parent in the group talked about their own children growing up in AA and how \u201cyou do what you have to do to stay sober.\u201d Essentially, the consensus was that it is far better for a kid to have to be dragged to meetings a few hours a week than to have a mom drunk all the time.\n\nI still take my son to AA meetings, but now I allow him to play on my tablet with headphones. (I got reamed in the comments for not allowing my kid to do this before. Fair enough. I just have this \u201cthing\u201d about kids being on technology as a quick fix for boredom, but I need to get over that.)\n\nMy son gets a lot of treats and gifts from my home group members. One dude gives him $10s and $20s every time he sees my son (I know, right? Untapped resource!). My son is learning how to play electric guitar, and two AA members will rift with my son and talk music (Jimmy Hendrix is currently my son\u2019s hero). All in all, my son likes the attention and says he doesn\u2019t mind going to meetings.\n\nA surprising update in all of this is that my son\u2019s dad has stopped drinking. (Although he currently refuses to attend AA). My relationship with my ex is much better and my kiddo seems much happier as a whole.\n\nLife for all of us is just\u2026 better. And while I don\u2019t want to turn this into a public endorsement for AA, I just want to say that sobriety is hands-down the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to my family.", "created_utc": 1681160273, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12hvzpl/update_aita_for_forcing_my_7yearold_to_go_to_aa/", "score": 470, "replies": ["You should be incredibly proud of yourself for the work you're putting in!

I wasn\u2019t as worried about your son being at the meetings (I had to attend a few at exactly the same age and it didn\u2019t scar me for life, if anything it gave me empathy and I learned anyone can stumble. Rich, poor, etc.). I was worried about how the other folks would feel to have to censor their shares. But you say they are fine with it so I guess keep doing what you have to do to stay sober. \n\nI get everyone\u2019s reactions to this but honestly being a part of my mothers journey to sobriety was positive for me. I saw her with my own eyes pick herself up, dust herself off and get well. She didn\u2019t make excuses she just did the work which I saw so I believed she would get better. And I was lucky she did. It would be nice if you could find a meeting with care and a playroom or maybe this could be a project you spear head. You can\u2019t be the only parent. We had those as well and that was also nice bc I got to meet other kids that understood what I was going through bc they were going through it too.

You were selfish. You did something for yourself, because of your drinking, that is still continuing to harm your son. \n\nAA is not for everybody, and it\u2019s especially not for a child who had no choice in participating in it. Your son is already exposed to your sobriety journey, I\u2019m adamant that he should not be exposed to other stranger\u2019s sobriety journey as well. No child should have to grow up going to AA meetings. He\u2019s 8. He doesn\u2019t understand right now what those meetings are.

They have even eased up on the high power stuff in a lot of the meetings bc many folks are atheists. My mother went to AA and it saved her life. She did it consistently for a year and then stopped but she never drank again for the rest of her life. Some people go for life bc it\u2019s basically free group therapy. Some people go for a while, some on occasion for maintenance, some just a few times but still manage to stay sober. It\u2019s a safe space and has been proven to help folks get clean. It\u2019s why it\u2019s recommended by doctors and in patient programs are covered by insurance.

They got sober when I was 9 and I grew up with AA, the community formed through that. The birthday nights were some of the most special times that stick in my memory. Also, many of us ACOA (adult children of alcoholics) have skewed relationship with alcohol, family, relationships and so on--but not because of AA, rather the disease of alcoholism. You're right, 20 years down the road life looks different. But fuck addiction. Fuck what it did to my family. It's the addiction and abuse of alcohol that fucks up kids and families. You're welcome to not like AA for yourself but help me understand what horror AA is for children and not the actual addition itself?", "> Tell me one cult or religion for that matter that follows suit?\n\nEVERY cult or religion will tell you outwardly it does things like that, that all donations are voluntary, that people can leave whenever they choose.

And I learned a lot. It helped me not to just be angry at my mom for her addiction, but to have compassion and know that she\u2019s trying her best. It\u2019s an opportunity for your kid to learn about humanity, responsibility, consequences, compassion, etc. It will also likely benefit your relationship with him as he will see you taking responsibility for your actions and being accountable. \n\nMy father was also an alcoholic who unfortunately died from his addiction when I was in middle school.

I agree with your points about not being scarred for life, learning empathy, and seeing up close the journey of a parent becoming and staying sober.

Plus, we made other AA kid friends!", "I'm a child who grew up going to AA meetings with my mom because she was getting sober. We usually played in another area of the room and didn't really hear much of the detailed conversation. As far as the religious aspect goes, there is an element of a higher power, but how much weight each AA group gives that kind of depends on the community where the AA group is. Experiences vary, but from what I heard and saw as a child through an adult (I'd go to the birthday meetings to support my mom), the religious thing is pretty light-touch. It's not a cult, and was certainly less religious than the few times I went to a catholic mass. \n\nI know there's a lot of criticism of AA, but I have had a better life because I had a parent get sober through it, and I know many, many other people who have been able to achieve sobriety through it, many of whom could not have done it if the program required any payment.", "There are secular versions of AA that can be found online.

My understanding is that the official rule is that atheism is fine, but it\u2019s open to (mis)interpretation on an individual level.", "Lol it\u2019s all good. My first post was controversial and I wasn\u2019t under the impression that my update would be different. \n\nI\u2019m all smiles. None of this is bothering me. I figured if my post could reach even one person who may be suffering than it\u2019s totally worth the backlash.", "A higher power is a deity.", "That's simply not true. In the context of AA or in a lot of world religions and traditions.", "Literally all a higher power has to be in the context of AA is something that acts outside of yourself.\n\n\"Some people may avoid Alcoholics Anonymous or moving through the steps because they believe that their higher power has to be God. Your higher power can be anything that you believe in: the universe, nature, Buddha, music, love, Allah, humanity or even AA itself. AA doesn\u2019t require you to believe in anything that you don\u2019t want to; each step is a suggestion along the road to a sober life.1\"", "Not necessarily when it comes to AA. like other people have said, it really depends on the group.", "So there are groups that omit any mention of higher power?", "No, they just reframe it as having something that is a \"power\" greater than yourself. Like love."]}
