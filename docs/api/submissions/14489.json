I can now be more present and a better mom to my child, and for that, I\u2019m incredibly grateful. AA has quite literally saved my life and if anyone who is reading this struggles with addiction, I just want to say there IS a way out - you just have to know YOU ARE  WORTH IT and SOBRIETY is worth it. \n\nMy first post ended up being a mixed bag in terms of judgements about my assholery. I accept my judgment of being the AH but I did want to clarify a common misconception. Abstaining from alcohol is just a small portion of AA. A much larger portion is dedicated to is looking into WHY we drink, take accountability for our selfish actions and apologize accordingly and to rectify our character defects so we can be better ppl to our friends and family. Because of these aspects, I was hoping exposing my son to the program would teach him something about accountability, patience, and empathy. \n\nI ended up just asking my AA home group if it bothered them that I brought my son to meetings. Not only did everyone look at me like I grew a second head for even asking for permission, every parent in the group talked about their own children growing up in AA and how \u201cyou do what you have to do to stay sober.\u201d Essentially, the consensus was that it is far better for a kid to have to be dragged to meetings a few hours a week than to have a mom drunk all the time.\n\nI still take my son to AA meetings, but now I allow him to play on my tablet with headphones. (I got reamed in the comments for not allowing my kid to do this before. Fair enough. I just have this \u201cthing\u201d about kids being on technology as a quick fix for boredom, but I need to get over that.)\n\nMy son gets a lot of treats and gifts from my home group members. One dude gives him $10s and $20s every time he sees my son (I know, right? Untapped resource!). My son is learning how to play electric guitar, and two AA members will rift with my son and talk music (Jimmy Hendrix is currently my son\u2019s hero). All in all, my son likes the attention and says he doesn\u2019t mind going to meetings.\n\nA surprising update in all of this is that my son\u2019s dad has stopped drinking. (Although he currently refuses to attend AA). My relationship with my ex is much better and my kiddo seems much happier as a whole.\n\nLife for all of us is just\u2026 better. And while I don\u2019t want to turn this into a public endorsement for AA, I just want to say that sobriety is hands-down the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to my family.", "created_utc": 1681160273, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12hvzpl/update_aita_for_forcing_my_7yearold_to_go_to_aa/", "score": 191, "replies": ["You should be incredibly proud of yourself for the work you're putting in! Congrats on getting and staying sober. I'm happy to read about your life getting better and I couldn't help but smile reading about this group who have really embraced your son.", "Congratulations on your continued sobriety!", "Congratulations on being sober! I wasn\u2019t as worried about your son being at the meetings (I had to attend a few at exactly the same age and it didn\u2019t scar me for life, if anything it gave me empathy and I learned anyone can stumble. Rich, poor, etc.). I was worried about how the other folks would feel to have to censor their shares. But you say they are fine with it so I guess keep doing what you have to do to stay sober. \n\nI get everyone\u2019s reactions to this but honestly being a part of my mothers journey to sobriety was positive for me. I saw her with my own eyes pick herself up, dust herself off and get well. She didn\u2019t make excuses she just did the work which I saw so I believed she would get better. And I was lucky she did. It would be nice if you could find a meeting with care and a playroom or maybe this could be a project you spear head. You can\u2019t be the only parent. We had those as well and that was also nice bc I got to meet other kids that understood what I was going through bc they were going through it too. Good luck.", "I'm glad that AA helps people.\n\nBut it strikes me (as a non alcoholic) as very intertwined with religious / cult-like behaviour, in some of the programme of steps.\n\nI find it weird how it's recommended (and covered by many health insurance policies) almost to the exclusion of any other addiction recovery programmes, even those that are proven to be more successful. \n\nI am still not sure that it's appropriate to expose such a young child to some of the content of the discussions that can arise. \n\nAren't there other options to educate a kid on healthy behaviour and good qualities?\n\nBut hey I guess at least you let him use his tablet now.", "Congratulations! Good to see some positivity in this community for a change.", ">\tLife for all of us is just\u2026 better.\n\nThat\u2019s really wonderful. Congratulations.", "As a child of an alcoholic, I want to thank you for including your kid for the process. It's never easy to stay sober but you're doing great. It's better to be dragged to meetings a couple times a week as a kid and see the sober community than to be constantly exposed to your disease and the negative consequences that shadows it. Nta for being a good example for your kid.", "Glad to see this update. I grew up in NA meetings until I was like 12. There are def horror stories but it made me so much more knowledgeable on the dangers of drugs and alcohol.", "The thing about sobriety is that you also have to accept the harm you have caused onto others. \n\nIn the process of pursuing sobriety, you were actively exposing your child to harm. You were selfish. You did something for yourself, because of your drinking, that is still continuing to harm your son. \n\nAA is not for everybody, and it\u2019s especially not for a child who had no choice in participating in it. Your son is already exposed to your sobriety journey, I\u2019m adamant that he should not be exposed to other stranger\u2019s sobriety journey as well. No child should have to grow up going to AA meetings. He\u2019s 8. He doesn\u2019t understand right now what those meetings are. He may be getting gifts and playing on his electronics and maybe that\u2019s all he sees for now, but to grow up doing this? For AA to be a part of his life? Five, ten, twenty years down the line he\u2019ll see it differently. He deserves so much better. He shouldn\u2019t have to grow up in the shadows of your negative correlation to alcohol.\n\n Congratulations on your sobriety and I wish you success, but I think maybe you need to accept that your drinking is still harmful to your child.", "i didn't catch your first post, but i woulda said NTA. my dad had to take me to NA meetings when i was a kid, and while i was more bored than anything at the time, i'm glad i was able to support him in that. \n\ncongrats on the continued sobriety! you got this!", "Congratulations! I know AA isn't for everyone, and not the only system out there; just be happy your ex is sober if he's found something that works. People sometimes get hung up on the systems used when there's not a one size fits all solution. That's all I have to add, sounds like a good update! :)", "A stranger is giving your child money every time he sees him?", "Congratulations and kudos to you for taking the constructive feedback.  So glad things are working out for you and for the family!", "Good for you, and congratulations on your continuing sobriety.", "Congrats on being sober and finding a way that works for all of you. The 12 steps saved my life (food was my drug of choice) and it gave me the life I have today. You got this girl!", "This was lovely to hear! Congratulations to you! You should be proud!", "NTA - Kudos for you taking your son with you. AA, Alanon, Alateen....all great programs. I admire you for helping more than yourself, by helping your son.", "Just FYI many AA meetings had childcare before COVID.\n\nYou could probably find some that still do. Just ask some of the old timers. They\u2019ll be in the know. There\u2019s also online \n\nI think it\u2019s totally chill. One hour in the corner self entertaining is not a bad thing for a kid IMO. Whether he be reading, drawing, playin games on a phone, etc.. It won\u2019t kill the child but honestly could kill you if you don\u2019t go, particularly if you\u2019re still fresh.", "Unfortunately, I live in a very small town so there aren\u2019t tons of options in terms of child care. Thank you for the kind and supportive comment!", "> I am still not sure that it's appropriate to expose such a young child to some of the content of the discussions that can arise\n\nYeah, I also have concerns about this. I think the headphones + tablet helps some. But I still have concerns.", "AA let\u2019s you believe what you want, leave when you want, and survives off of $1 donations (and you don\u2019t even have to donate). Tell me one cult or religion for that matter that follows suit?", "AA is not a cult. You don\u2019t worship a leader. They have even eased up on the high power stuff in a lot of the meetings bc many folks are atheists. My mother went to AA and it saved her life. She did it consistently for a year and then stopped but she never drank again for the rest of her life. Some people go for life bc it\u2019s basically free group therapy. Some people go for a while, some on occasion for maintenance, some just a few times but still manage to stay sober. It\u2019s a safe space and has been proven to help folks get clean. It\u2019s why it\u2019s recommended by doctors and in patient programs are covered by insurance. Religious doesn\u2019t necessarily make a cult and as I\u2019ve said in certain regions they are taking the word God out of the steps and the serenity prayer.", "To an 8 year old child, it\u2019s just other adults giving him treats and getting to play on electronics. \n\nBut when that 8 year old child grows up, he\u2019ll understand he was brought to participate in something he should\u2019ve been given a choice to participate in but was not given one, and he\u2019ll grow up with so many negative connotations to alcohol. And I\u2019m not advocating for drinking at all, but everyone deserves to find their own healthy relationship with alcohol without the shadow of their parents alcoholism towering over them.", "Thank you so much for your kind words. \n\nBased on my original post and this one, it seems that the ppl who are actively against it know nothing about addiction and AA. It\u2019s been refreshing hearing from kids of alcoholic parents give their two cents, because you all know first hand.", "As an adult child of an alcoholic who is scarred for life for the memories and horrible things my parent did while drunk and drinking, I'm not sure where you're coming from. They got sober when I was 9 and I grew up with AA, the community formed through that. The birthday nights were some of the most special times that stick in my memory. Also, many of us ACOA (adult children of alcoholics) have skewed relationship with alcohol, family, relationships and so on--but not because of AA, rather the disease of alcoholism. You're right, 20 years down the road life looks different. But fuck addiction. Fuck what it did to my family. It's the addiction and abuse of alcohol that fucks up kids and families. You're welcome to not like AA for yourself but help me understand what horror AA is for children and not the actual addition itself?", "> Tell me one cult or religion for that matter that follows suit?\n\nEVERY cult or religion will tell you outwardly it does things like that, that all donations are voluntary, that people can leave whenever they choose. What matters far more is the lived experience of members.", "Like I said, I'm glad it's helped people.\n\nI retain my opinions on it's religious-like cult-like aspects.\n\nYou are welcome to disagree. \ud83d\ude01", "I hear what you\u2019re saying, buuuut. Alcoholism is *extremely* heritable. If your parent is an alcoholic, you\u2019re living in that shadow regardless of being dragged to AA or not. \n\n(Both my parents are alcoholics & it changes how I interface with drinking.)", "Another adult child of alcoholic here. My alcoholic parent was on a clear path that would've lead to their death had it not been for sobriety. I have terrible memories of the things done in addiction, and though it wasn't an easy path, staying sober was the best thing for all of us. I'm glad to have experienced AA at a young age and the transformation it brought.", "Look I get it. Trust me, if anyone is against religion and cults, it\u2019s me. I came into the program as a staunch atheist who also thought AA talk about god was off-putting. \n\nEveryone in the program has their own concept and understanding of a higher power. Some do not prescribe to any God and are still successful with their recovery. \n\nIf anything, AA is a spiritual program - not religion. But I totally understand how outsiders would have that misconception", "I feel it\u2019s important to not throw words around but you\u2019re entitled to your opinion. Cult is a strong word and I don\u2019t believe AA is in the same realm as nxivm or Scientology and it\u2019s irresponsible to hint otherwise. Because I feel strongly about this I feel the need to speak up. No shade.", "You also said you're a non alcoholic and don't understand so stop with your BS.", "Thank you for sharing!", "My mother went to AA and it was very Christian centered. The serenity prayer is religious as it directly mentions God and it's printed on my mother's sobriety chips.\n\n\"God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change\". I don't know if that's how it was for you but that's how it is in a lot of meetings here.", "Don't listen to those who don't understand. Keep doing what works for you and fuck the haters. Congratulations and good luck."]}
