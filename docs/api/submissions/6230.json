It was an old apartment building built in 1920's so tow truck couldn't tow in tiny \nparking lot but I called non emergency number and got them a ticket. It was such satisfaction seeing them walk up to their car and seeing ticket on their windshield", "NTA for not towing his sorry ass. Next time just tow them, not your issue.", "NTA\n\nHe was in the wrong. The situation sucked but doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s your problem", "NTA. He should have assumed, you will be back and can't offer it in the first place. What was he thinking, that you search on your own for a car park? Just ignore him. He is 100% in the wrong.", "NTA", "NTA. He\u2019s a giant ah though. Maybe print out these comments and tape them on his car windows.", "I love how there being no street parking for his gf is your problem. If she couldn\u2019t find parking, how were you? Not to mention you already pay for that spot to park in.\n\nDefinitely report that guy to the management.\n\nNTA", "NTA. If she was going to have trouble finding a spot, why wouldn\u2019t you? I\u2019d just report the dude to management for harassing you", "NTA", "NTA Your neighbor should not have offered your car spot without speaking with you. You did them a favour by calling them instead of towing.", "NTA. He should have given his gf HIS spot and found his own off street space.", "NTA.", "NTA. \"Look, you can move it or I can call the towing company. It's your choice.\"", "NTA. I would\u2019ve had them towed.", "Since parking was an issue, he could have paid for her to Uber over. Or drove and picked her up instead. \n\n And every time he is around you, start video taping everything.  So you can record his actions and words as evidence.", "NTA.\n\nSo, his argument was how difficult for his GF to find a spot on the street. Why did he think you would have ut easier?\n\nIn general - you are entitled to the space you pay for.", "NTA.\n\nIt would have been easier for him to find a parking spot on the street earlier. By letting her park in your spot, he made his problem worse than it needed to be. But that's not your problem.\n\nThe \"DON'T HAVE TOWED\" note was clear evidence that he knew what he was doing was wrong. He could have offered you $20 or $50 to let them leave the car there. Instead, he hoped you would be non-confrontational enough to let them get away with it.", "You should have towed him. NTA", "Next time just call the tow truck. NTA", "Next time tow. Have a motion censor in car camera.", "NTA.  Your neighbor might think he's entitled to your space, but he isn't.  And his yelling at you in the hallway is a problem.  You might want to share this with your landlord in case your awful neighbor escalates.", "\u201cHe was gentlemanly enough to offer something of someone\u2019s else\u2019s to her\u201d is the best line ever.", "nta why do people think they can park in other peoples spots?", "His argument was that it's a late hour and hard to find a spot on the street so you should be the one that has to do it? Your neighbor is a major entitled AH. You are NTA", "NTA...you could have had the car towed and still not be the AH. I would do as others have suggested and somehow get a camera on your car for a while to insure this jackass doesn't do worse to your car.", "NTA, why would you even think you are? Just be happy you aren't insane like your neighbor obviously is.", "Please put security camera outside your windows. My friend reported the neighbors for being noisy after midnight. His tyres were slashed the next day. Then again and again and again. My friend's eventually moved out.", "Try some WD-40 on the glue.  Spray a fair bit, rub it in gently and leave for 10 minutes.  Then rub it off with a microfibre cloth.", "Put a little camera in the tree facing your car.. some of them are pretty cheap.", "Rubbing alcohol usually works- never heard of acetone (I mean I have, just not for removing stuff safely without damaging finish).  Spot test a less visible spot, before going too bonkers!", "Have you heard of r/unethicallifeprotips?", "Acetone won't hurt modern OEM paint, especially if it's only there for a few seconds. Keep it away from plastic trim, and if there's a chance the area has been repainted with something other than basecoat/urethane clearcoat, don't use it at all.\n\nIt WILL strip any wax from the finish, so after removing it, polish it then wax it.", "definitely don\u2019t use acetone that shit will eat through anything", "Acetone is nail polish remover, the really smelly kind...", "Rubbing alcohol will not damage your finish- it is what is recommended for removing sap. Try that maybe!", "Try spraying it with WD40. That gets most things off and doesn't damage the car at all. Basically spray, sit for 5 minutes, wipe off with a soft cloth or shami. Rinse and repeat a couple of times and it should do the trick.", "A professional detailer (whose also highly skilled on exterior work) would be able to get it off your car. The really good detailers can cut into the clear coat on the paint, without cutting into it too hard and leaving any noticeable changes. My fathers done this for years, and been able to get rid of light scratches (or make them less noticeable if they\u2019re deep).", "hairspray too!"]}
