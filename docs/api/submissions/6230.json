They give you a sticker with a number on it (I'm #80) and you park in the spot with that number. Pretty simple. So, I always have guaranteed parking, unless they're doing some sort of maintenance on the lot.\n\nA bit ago they were redoing the surrounding streets and had to have all the people who live in the area and don't have a parking permit for a space move to other areas, which is obviously inconvenient in a congested urban area, but in theory has no effect on me.\n\nI came home late one night at about 1am from a friend's house and there was a car in my spot. Now, the building has a giant sign up to let people know the lot is under contract with a tow company. I was about to call but noticed the car had a note in the window. Something like, \"DON'T HAVE TOWED! CALL XXX-XXX-XXXX!\"\n\nI called and a few minutes later one of my neighbors who would also have an assigned spot, came out. He politely explained that there were no spots on the street, so he offered his girlfriend mine. Which means he parked in his space and then was gentlemanly enough to offer something of someone else's to her.\n\nI let him know it is my spot, so he'd have to move. We had a brief argument about the late hour and how hard it would be for her to find a spot on the street. Not seeing how either of them having trouble finding parking on the street was a ***me*** problem I insisted he move, and he went to get the keys and got out of my spot.\n\nI ran into him in the hallway a few days later, at which point he looked at me and said, \"FUCK YOU!\" I don't think we're going to be friends.\n\nAm I the A-hole for asking him to get out of my spot even if it was 1am and all of the surrounding roads were under construction?", "created_utc": 1672600628, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/100qwbv/aita_for_making_my_neighbor_move_a_car_out_of_my/", "score": 183, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sounds like this guy might be trouble for you and anyone else who doesn't bend to his will.  He held a grudge for several days and knows where you live and where you park.

You are under no obligation to return home at a waking hour to alleviate a thief's pain. Besides, he could have picked his GF up knowing there were no parking spaces.\n\nHe may have prior complaints, and this may be what they need to kick him out of the community. At the very least, it could help his next victim in the future.", "NTA. Next time have them towed. Seriously.

Definitely not a you problem.", "NTA. Seriously, you were being incredibly gracious by not calling the company and having it towed. And if the excuse is, \u201cno spots are available,\u201d then guess what? You wouldn\u2019t be able to find a spot either despite the fact that you pay for parking. Next time this happens with this neighbor, call the company and have it towed.", "A HARD NTA.", "NTA.   I'm not exactly sure on what planet he thought his explanation was going to resolve the issue.\n\nHe shouldn't have used your spot.", "NTA. This is a simple case of consequence catching up with choice. Well done.", "NTA.\n\nYou were kind enough not to have his car towed and he\u2019s somehow mad at YOU? Ridiculous.", "NTA\n\nYou did him a favour by not calling the tow company.", "NTA. You could have just had the car towed & not done him the courtesy of calling him instead as his note asked you to. He seems to be overlooking that fact.", "NTA \n\nYour spot, your rules.   \n\n\nYou were nice not to tow.  \n\n\nShe\u2019s not your girlfriend, so you don\u2019t owe her a parking solution.", "NTA\n\nThe entitled neighbor is the AH. Next time just have the car towed.", "NTA.

He knew the rules.", "NTA - IT'S YOUR SPOT. people like him just everyone here needs to help make his life easier.

Tell him in straight words that he's ridiculous and can't just take your spot.", "NTA. You could have called the tow company.

He\u2019s going to act like a jerk regardless of what option you chose, so the least you can do is to park in your designated spot that you pay for. \n\nHe didn\u2019t want to move it that late at night and this would have just caused future inconveniences with him freely letting his girlfriend park in your spot if you didn\u2019t confront him.
