Something like, \"DON'T HAVE TOWED! CALL XXX-XXX-XXXX!\"\n\nI called and a few minutes later one of my neighbors who would also have an assigned spot, came out. He politely explained that there were no spots on the street, so he offered his girlfriend mine. Which means he parked in his space and then was gentlemanly enough to offer something of someone else's to her.\n\nI let him know it is my spot, so he'd have to move. We had a brief argument about the late hour and how hard it would be for her to find a spot on the street. Not seeing how either of them having trouble finding parking on the street was a ***me*** problem I insisted he move, and he went to get the keys and got out of my spot.\n\nI ran into him in the hallway a few days later, at which point he looked at me and said, \"FUCK YOU!\" I don't think we're going to be friends.\n\nAm I the A-hole for asking him to get out of my spot even if it was 1am and all of the surrounding roads were under construction?", "created_utc": 1672600628, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/100qwbv/aita_for_making_my_neighbor_move_a_car_out_of_my/", "score": 503, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
