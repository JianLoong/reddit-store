Our house is pretty decent in size each 2 of the 4 kids share a room , then my husband and I bedroom. So in total we have 3 sleeping rooms and no extras for sleeping. My husband\u2019s mother been sick for quite a while and she needs to be taken care of 24/7 that\u2019s why my husband got her a personal nurse and caretaker.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\n\nRecently my husband been tired of paying the nurse and his mother\u2019s rent to he suggested she moves in with us so he wouldn\u2019t pay her rent and only pay for the nurse. As I said our house is already packed with the 6 of us so bringing his mother AND the nurse would be 8 our house can\u2019t handle that and we do not have enough rooms. Also his mother cannot sit down she always has to lie in bed and we don\u2019t have any possible extra bed or space to put a new bed in, husband suggested that she stays in my youngest kids room that only has 2 beds so my kids (10 and 12) to sleep on one bed while his mother takes the other one and I straight up refused and told him I won\u2019t disturb my kids comfort like that and we still won\u2019t have a place for the nurse. He told me I stay at home and quit my job so he can cut off the nurse and I take care of his mother. I told him how about he takes care of his mother  and quit to stay at home and he said no.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe hasn\u2019t moved in yet, I won\u2019t allow it the house already feels small for us 6. Also I have 3 more brother-in-laws (one 1 of them lives alone and isn\u2019t married) so my husband is not her only child yet he is the one who paid for the nurse and the rent alone I asked him to tell his brothers to help he refused his \u201cpride\u201d didn\u2019t allow him to ask them for help but he was completely fine with asking me to quit my job so he wouldn\u2019t pay for a nurse and to ask me to pack the house more because he can\u2019t pay her rent. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis been going on for so long and he called me heartless for refusing her to move in I told him she can move in if we get ourselves a bigger house then he proceeded to call me ungrateful for what I have. I don\u2019t have a problem with her personally but I don\u2019t wanna suffocate at home and don\u2019t want to shove in 2 of my kids in one bed neither do I wanna quit my job.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit:- \n\nI didn\u2019t add this part because the word limit but the full story is when I married my husband we were all good and nothing made our household shake. Until 4 years ago FIL died and my husband changed 180\u00b0 and started being this miserable asshole he is. I was handling it at first in consideration that that\u2019s his father who died but it has been 4 years. \n\nI\u2019ve been preparing to divorce him for a year now and was going to buy a house then thankfully my late uncle left me a house that I inherited so I was able to save the money I was going to spend on a new house. The house been finalized under my name 4 months ago. My husband is aware of this and he knows that we are going to leave in the next 6 months so he is trying to do anything to hinder us or make life remaining months miserable just like having to quit my job and stay moneyless for 6 months and probably not finding a new job. He didn\u2019t tell me that\u2019s his intentions but I am aware of how he thinks when he has the expenses to cover up the house with me 50/50 and pay his mother rent. What\u2019s his problem then? He wouldn\u2019t be able to save the largest sum of money.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t I already leave? School started and leaving would mean they will all repeat their academic year I talked to them and made them know we can move now but made them aware of the outcome. They agreed on staying.\n\nWhy did I wait 4 years? I was saving up and preparing my things. Ik 4 years is a long time but I couldn\u2019t risk taking up 4 children when I don\u2019t have enough money for a house or educational tuition. \n\nCan he move his mother without my agreement? He knows if he did I\u2019ll stop paying anything in the house. We spend 3k every month we split it and he pays 500 for his mother rent and nurse. So in total he spends 2K on half the house and his mother. If he did anything without my agreement he\u2019ll pay 3K alone + the nurse obviously.\n\n\nHe told his mum I\u2019ll take care of her even though I never agreed and she sent me a message thanking me which I didn\u2019t answer. He lied to her so he would guilt trip me. He also contacted my siblings and my friends to tell them I am a heartless woman that one day my kids leave me too like I left my MIL (news flash she has 4 kids I am not one of them).", "created_utc": 1692701140, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15y2489/aita_for_refusing_that_my_sick_motherinlaw_to/", "score": 416, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

First and foremost, you don\u2019t just move grandma in a room with two kids when she\u2019s bed bound. If GMA needs care in the middle of the night the nurse will be up moving around helping her and wake them up. This is not healthy for your children. 2. Even if you had one extra room it\u2019s still not enough. You could shove all 4 kids in the master bedroom and you and hubby can move into the larger of the spare bedrooms BUT that gives grandma a room and not the nurse. 3. If you moved it wouldn\u2019t solve the problem of how GMA would handle things. When my MIL moved in with us (house mates are a 2 yes 1 no situation by the way) we actually had to put her in a temporary assisted living situation. She did NOT handle a 7 yo and infant in the house. It agitated her. She yelled at the kids. We had a MIL apartment that we planned on fixing up while she stayed in the main house but after a few days we realized it wasn\u2019t a healthy situation. We put her in the facility for a week and then paid people to fix up the apartment from classroom to soothing 50\u2019s theme that was childproofed. (Disconnect the stove, clean out the classroom bc we homeschool and turn it into a home, lock all outlets, put up a gate, paint, etc) 4. Having a parent move in is extremely stressful. Oh my is it stressful and that\u2019s if you have the space. 5. It\u2019s not ok to make your spouse feel bad and try to force them to quit their job to take care of your parent. That\u2019s not how this works. 6. If he\u2019s not willing to change mom\u2019s diapers\u2026he shouldn\u2019t be making you feel bad for not being willing to change them. 7. It\u2019s time to talk to the BIL\u2019s. Call them yourself. Tell them you guys need to get together to discuss mom. Invite them over for dinner and be honest. You guys can\u2019t keep doing this and your home isn\u2019t big enough. So either they step up or mom is going to have to go in a home.
