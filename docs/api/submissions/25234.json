Our house is pretty decent in size each 2 of the 4 kids share a room , then my husband and I bedroom. So in total we have 3 sleeping rooms and no extras for sleeping. My husband\u2019s mother been sick for quite a while and she needs to be taken care of 24/7 that\u2019s why my husband got her a personal nurse and caretaker.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\n\nRecently my husband been tired of paying the nurse and his mother\u2019s rent to he suggested she moves in with us so he wouldn\u2019t pay her rent and only pay for the nurse. As I said our house is already packed with the 6 of us so bringing his mother AND the nurse would be 8 our house can\u2019t handle that and we do not have enough rooms. Also his mother cannot sit down she always has to lie in bed and we don\u2019t have any possible extra bed or space to put a new bed in, husband suggested that she stays in my youngest kids room that only has 2 beds so my kids (10 and 12) to sleep on one bed while his mother takes the other one and I straight up refused and told him I won\u2019t disturb my kids comfort like that and we still won\u2019t have a place for the nurse. He told me I stay at home and quit my job so he can cut off the nurse and I take care of his mother. I told him how about he takes care of his mother  and quit to stay at home and he said no.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe hasn\u2019t moved in yet, I won\u2019t allow it the house already feels small for us 6. Also I have 3 more brother-in-laws (one 1 of them lives alone and isn\u2019t married) so my husband is not her only child yet he is the one who paid for the nurse and the rent alone I asked him to tell his brothers to help he refused his \u201cpride\u201d didn\u2019t allow him to ask them for help but he was completely fine with asking me to quit my job so he wouldn\u2019t pay for a nurse and to ask me to pack the house more because he can\u2019t pay her rent. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis been going on for so long and he called me heartless for refusing her to move in I told him she can move in if we get ourselves a bigger house then he proceeded to call me ungrateful for what I have. I don\u2019t have a problem with her personally but I don\u2019t wanna suffocate at home and don\u2019t want to shove in 2 of my kids in one bed neither do I wanna quit my job.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit:- \n\nI didn\u2019t add this part because the word limit but the full story is when I married my husband we were all good and nothing made our household shake. Until 4 years ago FIL died and my husband changed 180\u00b0 and started being this miserable asshole he is. I was handling it at first in consideration that that\u2019s his father who died but it has been 4 years. \n\nI\u2019ve been preparing to divorce him for a year now and was going to buy a house then thankfully my late uncle left me a house that I inherited so I was able to save the money I was going to spend on a new house. The house been finalized under my name 4 months ago. My husband is aware of this and he knows that we are going to leave in the next 6 months so he is trying to do anything to hinder us or make life remaining months miserable just like having to quit my job and stay moneyless for 6 months and probably not finding a new job. He didn\u2019t tell me that\u2019s his intentions but I am aware of how he thinks when he has the expenses to cover up the house with me 50/50 and pay his mother rent. What\u2019s his problem then? He wouldn\u2019t be able to save the largest sum of money.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t I already leave? School started and leaving would mean they will all repeat their academic year I talked to them and made them know we can move now but made them aware of the outcome. They agreed on staying.\n\nWhy did I wait 4 years? I was saving up and preparing my things. Ik 4 years is a long time but I couldn\u2019t risk taking up 4 children when I don\u2019t have enough money for a house or educational tuition. \n\nCan he move his mother without my agreement? He knows if he did I\u2019ll stop paying anything in the house. We spend 3k every month we split it and he pays 500 for his mother rent and nurse. So in total he spends 2K on half the house and his mother. If he did anything without my agreement he\u2019ll pay 3K alone + the nurse obviously.\n\n\nHe told his mum I\u2019ll take care of her even though I never agreed and she sent me a message thanking me which I didn\u2019t answer. He lied to her so he would guilt trip me. He also contacted my siblings and my friends to tell them I am a heartless woman that one day my kids leave me too like I left my MIL (news flash she has 4 kids I am not one of them).", "created_utc": 1692701140, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15y2489/aita_for_refusing_that_my_sick_motherinlaw_to/", "score": 1116, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

First and foremost, you don\u2019t just move grandma in a room with two kids when she\u2019s bed bound. If GMA needs care in the middle of the night the nurse will be up moving around helping her and wake them up. This is not healthy for your children. 2. Even if you had one extra room it\u2019s still not enough. You could shove all 4 kids in the master bedroom and you and hubby can move into the larger of the spare bedrooms BUT that gives grandma a room and not the nurse. 3. If you moved it wouldn\u2019t solve the problem of how GMA would handle things. When my MIL moved in with us (house mates are a 2 yes 1 no situation by the way) we actually had to put her in a temporary assisted living situation. She did NOT handle a 7 yo and infant in the house. It agitated her. She yelled at the kids. We had a MIL apartment that we planned on fixing up while she stayed in the main house but after a few days we realized it wasn\u2019t a healthy situation. We put her in the facility for a week and then paid people to fix up the apartment from classroom to soothing 50\u2019s theme that was childproofed. (Disconnect the stove, clean out the classroom bc we homeschool and turn it into a home, lock all outlets, put up a gate, paint, etc) 4. Having a parent move in is extremely stressful. Oh my is it stressful and that\u2019s if you have the space. 5. It\u2019s not ok to make your spouse feel bad and try to force them to quit their job to take care of your parent. That\u2019s not how this works. 6. If he\u2019s not willing to change mom\u2019s diapers\u2026he shouldn\u2019t be making you feel bad for not being willing to change them. 7. It\u2019s time to talk to the BIL\u2019s. Call them yourself. Tell them you guys need to get together to discuss mom. Invite them over for dinner and be honest. You guys can\u2019t keep doing this and your home isn\u2019t big enough. So either they step up or mom is going to have to go in a home.

If my grandmother said no to us doing anything we could forget about it because it would not be allowed. So I suggest having an open honest conversation with your kids. Chances out unless you had money for around a clock care and a lot of space this isn\u2019t the warm fuzzy picture your painting!", "Was the update/extra info on the post when you wrote this 12 minutes ago?  She's already planning to divorce him and he knows it.  He's just trying to figure out a way to trap her.", "I agree, she should move out asap.", "Also, regardless of what this person claims, it almost certainly impacted their kids.", "So your parents didn\u2019t do things correctly and caused trauma. They were wrong and I\u2019m sorry. But that\u2019s not how it is when it\u2019s done correctly. That was disrupting your lives and that wasn\u2019t ok. But when done correctly (which includes realizing when it\u2019s not a healthy environment instead of pushing it) it can be a beautiful thing. My MIL didn\u2019t spend any time in the hospital. By the time her health declined we had hospice and home health. (That was covered by insurance and maybe 2 hrs a day.) My husband and I did everything else. She had dinner with us and played with the kids on good days. On bad days she was kept away from the kids. It was their home first and they deserved a safe place. Grandma got zero control in our house bc the kids came first and grandma came second. My kids missed out on nothing bc we got a babysitter to make sure their needs were met first. I\u2019m so sorry you guys went through that. I couldn\u2019t imagine how hard that was for you. Personally my husband and I sat down before she moved in with us and laid out rules on when it was time for a nursing home. We also agreed the kids weren\u2019t caregivers. It was 100% on us and if it got to the point we couldn\u2019t do it\u2026it was time for a nursing home. When it got time for her death they weren\u2019t allowed in her \u201capartment\u201d (it was a room and bathroom with a sink and kitchen counter by the house with utilitites) until after we had been over there first to make sure she was still alive. The kids could choose to interact with her or not. When she \u201ccame over\u201d to visit they could leave the room. The only time they were required to be around her was at dinner time when we had family dinner. Your story honestly breaks my heart. It could have been a positive for you and your siblings assuming you liked grandma and she was nice.", "It most certainly wasn't, or at least my version of it on mobile browser didn't show it. I see it now, thanks.\n\nThanks for the downvotes, though. God Forbid someone on this site doesn't immediately start hollering \"Divorce! Red Flag! Gaslighting!\". JFC", "Again:  how is it not?  \n\nNo sitter= mom stays home.  So the kids need someone to pick them up from school and dad can\u2019t, mom can\u2019t and no one on the approved list can so who does:  no one.  What if the kids are being transported via EMTS to the hospital in the next 5 mins because it\u2019s a medical emergency and someone needs to meet them?  Mom gets to stay home while we hope dad meets them right away which sounds like he wouldn\u2019t because they don\u2019t matter or he\u2019d meet them when they are done.  There\u2019s a current example.", "I grew up in the life! Yes it is negative! I promise you my siblings and I resented our parents! Our child hood was never the same once our grandmother moved in!\n\nVacation, birthday parties, quality time with our parents was all gone! It\u2019s stressful. No one is happy. \n\nYou no longer have parents you have care takers that revolve the schedule around the person sick. If doesn\u2019t matter you have something going on.the sick personal takes priority.\n\n\nYour u can\u2019t have friends over. You have to be in bed early or at least stay quiet. You have to tip toe around in the mornings.\n\nI would never put my small kids through this type of life, and neither would my siblings.\nIt was traumatic for us.", "I spent so much time in the hospital that the nurses helped me with algebra in high school and brought me books to read ( I loved to read!) I knew all of them by name  and 3 came to my high school graduation. If this tells you anything. My 4 years of high school I spent more time at the hospital then I did going to football games, basket ball game or dances.", "As a divorcee, let me give you another point of view to consider.  You are allowing your children to live in and witness an unhealthy relationship - which they may internalize as normal and be doomed to experience as well.  Changing during the school year gives them the ability to make friends in their new surroundings.  In the grand scheme of things, even if they have to repeat some schooling (can you make up for it in the summer?), is minor compared to persisting in your current living situation.  Good luck, but I do encourage you to get out now.", "NTA, you stay right. Call a divorce lawyer now, and find out if you're able to record without his permission. Then hopefully record a conversation where you explain to him you aren't quitting your job to take care of his mother, you are leaving him as soon as this academic season is over for the kids, and he needs to ask his siblings for help if he cant do it alone. If he needs to quit his job to take care of his mother the government will compensate him eventually. He's definitely setting you up for financial abuse, you need to protect yourself.", "OP, even though it\u2019s less than ideal, your kids will adjust. Please just pull the pin and get on with it - move. All of you will be happier. Know that your kids are also living in a house filled with stress and anger. They\u2019ll be better without that.", "I mean, moving in the summer is also a bummer for kids. Not being able to hang out with the friends you have since you moved away and not being able to make friends since you're not in school. If you move mid-year, at least they might be able to meet people? If possible, you could take a few weeks off from work if work is okay with it to move in and help them get acclimated to everything\n\n6 months is a long amount of time for him to brainstorm different ways to trap you.", "I am just now looking at it and I also don't see an update or edit.  I guess I could go into the OP's comments.  But not all of us read ALL the comments before making a post.", "Once again\u2026you are creating a narrative that I\u2019m talking about mom being the caregiver and grandma moving in\u2026WHEN IM NOT!!!", "People\u2019s experiences are breaking my heart. What you went through wasn\u2019t ok. That was a form of neglect. If done correctly it can be beautiful and the first rule of doing it correctly is the children/parents come first. It\u2019s not ok to put the children second. Second rule is boundaries have to be set. I\u2019m so sorry your parents didn\u2019t understand this and made it such a negative situation. It shouldn\u2019t be traumatic.", ">Changing schools in the middle of the year will be less of a sacrifice for your children than having a sick grandmother moved into their Already-crowded bedrooms and having to witness her 24-hr care. \n\nThere is something positive about children seeing their family providing loving care to an aging family member. The problem is this would not be loving care, as OP is not onboard. That is not to say anything negative about OP, since her husband is not exactly volunteering to physically provide that care. The whole family would have to be okay with it.", "I don't know when this story transpired. But I can only assume since it was just posted that this is happening right now. Schools just started for most countries (unknown country of story origin) but it almost seems like she is weaponizing the threat of divorce. Because if I was in this same situation I would file, no questions asked. Kids getting held back a year( seems unlikely) would still be better than being in this situation. The husband knows this and is using the threat of moving MIL in to rile up the OP, while she threatens to stop providing financial aid to the running of the house ( which would negatively affect her children). I mean can you imagine going to court for the divorce and telling the judge I stopped helping pay for stuff because he moved his MIL in even though i was for years paying X amount. Not sure if this is real or not, but it definitely feels like they both in this situation are just making things worse for the kids.", "I am a mom, a caregiver and what if the nurse is sick (if she gets to keep her job cause the husband is deciding EVERYTHING) and someone has to \u201cfill in\u201d while another nurse is being called?  MOM DOES\n\nETA:  I have nurses in and out at all times for the last 20 years.  I\u2019m literally using what\u2019s happened to me in the past when they were employed and my current situation sooo umm yea\n\nEtfa:  I have been the children too because I am 38 and been \u201cchoosing this job\u201d since I was around 6 but before 6 I had no choice, I made concessions and did stuff I shouldn\u2019t have been asked to do but \u201cchose\u201d to keep doing past that age.", "Transferring schools mid-year wouldn\u2019t mean they have to repeat the whole year. Plenty of kids move mid-year.\n\nAlso do you live in the southern hemisphere? It\u2019s August, in the northern hemisphere school either hasn\u2019t started yet or has just started so this would be a good time for them to move.", "Why would they repeat the year? It's just a transfer, they would lose nothing academically.\n\nEDIT: Even if they have to repeat the year... who can guarantee they won't repeat it if they suddenly have their very sick grandmother with them? Even sharing a bedroom?  This kind of stress might well make them unable to focus on their studies and have to repeat.", "I see you don\u2019t want to read so I won\u2019t be responding back.", "She can still leave. If he quits his job that\u2019s his problem (one he intentionally created) not hers.", "I have friends who moved from one country to another and bless them\u2026they spent 20 months all in the same grade. Depending on where they live a few towns over could literally be a new country. Even in the US moving towns could cause a change in grade status from a school that does year round vs a school that does Aug to May.", "Based on the fact that their children are mid year right now, they aren\u2019t in Canada or the US because the school year in North America is still heavily based on how it was when we were an agrarian society and needed the children to have summer off to work the fields.  The typical school year here runs from around Labour Day (the one in September, not May Day) until the end of June.  I\u2019m not sure about all countries in Europe, but I have relatives in the UK and while their school year is longer (they have school into July), they would not have resumed yet either.  I\u2019m thinking they are somewhere, not NA or EU, with a drastically different school year if they are mid year and have six months to finish.", "I live in OR, moved to CA my freshman year of high school. The curriculum of the school I attended was years behind what they were teaching in OR. I moved back my sophomore year and while still considered a sophomore, I had to retake all freshman classes because my testing showed I hadn't learned freshman math, science, etc. It put me majorly behind in school, and I had to play a game of catch up for the remaining 3 years.\n\nSimply moving just states did that to me, I believe moving towns could do the same. Schools do not all follow the exact same curriculum. They may have the same classes, but they aren't teaching the same things. Kids get left to try and merge the gaps from school A to school B, and rather than get help they get left behind.\n\nOP I applaud you for discussing this with your kids first and keeping their needs your priority. I can't imagine how hard it's been, but the end is nearly in sight!"]}
