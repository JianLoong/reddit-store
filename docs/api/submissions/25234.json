As I said our house is already packed with the 6 of us so bringing his mother AND the nurse would be 8 our house can\u2019t handle that and we do not have enough rooms. Also his mother cannot sit down she always has to lie in bed and we don\u2019t have any possible extra bed or space to put a new bed in, husband suggested that she stays in my youngest kids room that only has 2 beds so my kids (10 and 12) to sleep on one bed while his mother takes the other one and I straight up refused and told him I won\u2019t disturb my kids comfort like that and we still won\u2019t have a place for the nurse.

I told him how about he takes care of his mother  and quit to stay at home and he said no.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe hasn\u2019t moved in yet, I won\u2019t allow it the house already feels small for us 6. Also I have 3 more brother-in-laws (one 1 of them lives alone and isn\u2019t married) so my husband is not her only child yet he is the one who paid for the nurse and the rent alone I asked him to tell his brothers to help he refused his \u201cpride\u201d didn\u2019t allow him to ask them for help but he was completely fine with asking me to quit my job so he wouldn\u2019t pay for a nurse and to ask me to pack the house more because he can\u2019t pay her rent. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis been going on for so long and he called me heartless for refusing her to move in I told him she can move in if we get ourselves a bigger house then he proceeded to call me ungrateful for what I have. I don\u2019t have a problem with her personally but I don\u2019t wanna suffocate at home and don\u2019t want to shove in 2 of my kids in one bed neither do I wanna quit my job.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1692701140, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15y2489/aita_for_refusing_that_my_sick_motherinlaw_to/", "score": 36, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He is not proposing any compromise, he just wants everybody else to change their lives while he does nothing but still looks like the golden child.\n\nSecondly, if his mother needs this much care she needs somebody qualified to do this. Caring for somebody this sick and with this many needs requires skills and training doing so without could compromise her health even more. Not to mention the fact that you could not possibly give her all the time she needs because you have children. At some point you will have to decide between caring for you MIL and caring for your children which would not be good for either of them.\n\nAsk him if his pride means more to him that his family, if he says yes I think you have bigger problems that you think.\n\nEDIT: Also point out that your mother receiving care in a room with two other people are there would be compromising her dignity, what happens when she has an accident in the night and needs changing, or needs a bed bath etc. would his mother want that?

No amount of savings on rent/nursing will be able to compensate for the daily anxiety and stress that would come from trying to squeeze her into your arguably already overflowing household. Nor will it in any way be an acceptable price to pay for the impact on you and your children. \n\nHis response to your suggestion that he give up work and take of his mother speaks volumes. He is not willing to step up but expects you and your children to suck up enormous and detrimental changes to your daily lives so he can save money on care which he shouldn't in any way be solely responsible for. \n\nI cannot tell you what to do but this for me would be my hill to die on.

NTA, but urgently contact his other siblings yourself and try to work a solution because this won't hold out for long.", "NTA.", "Nta. 1. First and foremost, you don\u2019t just move grandma in a room with two kids when she\u2019s bed bound. If GMA needs care in the middle of the night the nurse will be up moving around helping her and wake them up. This is not healthy for your children. 2. Even if you had one extra room it\u2019s still not enough. You could shove all 4 kids in the master bedroom and you and hubby can move into the larger of the spare bedrooms BUT that gives grandma a room and not the nurse. 3. If you moved it wouldn\u2019t solve the problem of how GMA would handle things. When my MIL moved in with us (house mates are a 2 yes 1 no situation by the way) we actually had to put her in a temporary assisted living situation. She did NOT handle a 7 yo and infant in the house. It agitated her. She yelled at the kids. We had a MIL apartment that we planned on fixing up while she stayed in the main house but after a few days we realized it wasn\u2019t a healthy situation. We put her in the facility for a week and then paid people to fix up the apartment from classroom to soothing 50\u2019s theme that was childproofed. (Disconnect the stove, clean out the classroom bc we homeschool and turn it into a home, lock all outlets, put up a gate, paint, etc) 4. Having a parent move in is extremely stressful. Oh my is it stressful and that\u2019s if you have the space. 5. It\u2019s not ok to make your spouse feel bad and try to force them to quit their job to take care of your parent. That\u2019s not how this works. 6. If he\u2019s not willing to change mom\u2019s diapers\u2026he shouldn\u2019t be making you feel bad for not being willing to change them. 7. It\u2019s time to talk to the BIL\u2019s. Call them yourself. Tell them you guys need to get together to discuss mom. Invite them over for dinner and be honest. You guys can\u2019t keep doing this and your home isn\u2019t big enough. So either they step up or mom is going to have to go in a home. Let the brothers discuss.", "INFO: How long has it been going on? Is she terminal? My Dad passed away 6 years ago in our home with hospice, and it was really beautiful spending those last couple months of his life together as a family. Does MIL have a hope of recovery or will she need 24/7 care until she passes away? It might be good for your kids to form a relationship with her before she\u2019s gone, although I understand that\u2019s an immense burden too.", "You husband seems to think you are a slave. And that you should be grateful for being a slave.", "NTA\n\nHe isn't her only son nor are you a caretaker if he cares so much he can quit his job what type of misogynistic ass is he to expect you to give up your career to play nurse?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
