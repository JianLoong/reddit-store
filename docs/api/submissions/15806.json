As you said in the post, it's ideal to teach these things to children while they're young.

But unless someone teaches her the proper way to go about this, it couls turn into a bigger issue.\n\nPotential futures aside, you merely pointed it out to her mom.. didnt even confront your niece or attempted to berate her so the moms reaction is extremely out of proportion", "NTA, and i don't understand Jenna's reaction at all.

I think you should talk to your niece, because you know mommy didn't. Just tell her she is a really great singer and you love to listen to her singing but that people who write songs work really hard on them so it is not okay to say you made/wrote something and you didn't, somebody else did. Then tell her when she really writes a song you would love to hear it, maybe even ask if she can put a pet or special toy mentioned in her song. Also, it is very possible that mommy helped her \"write\" these songs so her daughter could impress people", "INFO: how old are you??? and what were the songs?\n\nLike okay so she's 7 and plagiarized a couple of songs from the early 2000's that her mom should probably know of since she's 34, but like... it's not that big of a deal. It's not like she's suddenly going to continue to plagarize people's work and get away with it... She's 7 years old... Seems kinda petty on your part \"because she's never been into music.\" Kids have a plethora of interests so why did that bother you so much?

That\u2019s not a reason to yell at you for sure. I also don\u2019t think any 7 y/o isn\u2019t a liar.

My little cousin lied for a very very long time as a kid, and she has become very thoughtful as a 13 year old. Totally mellowed out, and very calm now  while caring heavily about morals. But she wouldn\u2019t have understood shit when she was 7 if she was singing a song to me that she claimed to write.

As someone who loves their niece, I thought the best thing to do is let my cousin be aware of the situation. Although I agree that it wasn't a big deal, it might be something that could help her. Also, neither did I squash the kid nor the mother. As I clearly mentioned in the post, I pulled Jenna into the kitchen and showed it to her.

I am now trying to be more easy going with her and be more fun and it\u2019s making a difference.

How do your other family members know about this--did Jenna tell them or did you?", "Nta", "That stood out to me as well- the way she reacted do you think the mom \"helped\" her daughter write the songs?

Yesterday, my mom called me, and said I was in the wrong for \"calling Tina a liar\". I clarified what had happened, and she still thinks I was wrong for not going along with it. The entire family seems to think the same thing.", "I'm not a mother but I would find it funny.. and not be embarrassed? like, /facepalm/ \"i cant believe it! here i am thinking my kid is a creative genius, now you tell me she's conning me. oh my god my daughter is a con artist... you know what yeah, still genius!\" \n\ni mean as long as it's a private conversation. sometimes kids do dumb things thinking they're being smart and if you find it funny it might genuinely upset them. like you're laughing *at them* it's a delicate thing to handle but.. i think it's definitely a teaching moment, not screaming-at-cousin moment lol", "I agree. I also said NTA. I just thought it was worth providing a perspective that maybe he hadn\u2019t thought of. I thought I was doing the right thing until I realized I\u2019d done some damage to my relationships through my good intentions. At the very least, OP definitely did some damage in his relationship with his cousin.", "Thanks for clarifying--- it was kind of confusing and I thought you'd left someone out of the story.  While personally, I would not have brought up the incident while still at the party, there was nothing wrong with bringing it up later with Jenna just to put it on her radar.  She may have felt confronted by you jumping on it while the party was still going on and she didn't have time/space to process.  \n\nGetting the rest of the family involved was a total AH move on Jenna's part-- and in the long term only serves to further embarrass Tina.   At seven not all kids have the same black and white view of truth and lies that adults have.  They are still in many ways drawn in by fantasy and it's likely that Tina as a 7 year old saw nothing wrong with saying she wrote the song.  I would hesitate to call her a \"liar\" but what she said was not true.  (It's also entirely possible that Jenna already knew Tina wasn't telling the truth but that's a whole other can of worms.)", "Then Tina isn't your niece. Tina would only be your niece if she was the daughter of one of your siblings.", "NTA. Lying is wrong, and a seven year old should know this. This behavior needs to be stopped before she gets older and lies about things that are important.", "NTA\n\nIt seems like it came off as you just picking on a 7 y/o to her mom. She might not even realize where she got the lyrics from. She certainly doesn\u2019t understand the concept of plagiarism. Kids need to be taught in age-appropriate ways. At 7 that means not through criticism or someone calling them out to catch them in a lie. I think it would have been better to wait until later and say to your niece, \u201cI really liked those songs! They reminded me of other songs I know, would you like to hear them?\u201d And show her the songs one-on-one or just with you and her mom there and let it play out. She might be very straightforward that those songs are where she got her \u201cideas\u201d anyway. It still seems like Jenna overreacted though.", "NTA, and Jenna's reaction really makes me wonder if this isn't the first time she's been approached about similar behavior with Tina, or if Jenna was responsible for Tina \"writing\" these songs. At 7, I wouldn't expect Tina to know semi-obscure songs from 20+ years ago, but at 34, Jenna is pretty much exactly the right age to have a mental catalog of songs like this. \n\nIn any case, you did this the best way you could - you pulled Jenna privately aside, didn't embarrass Tina in front of other people, etc. Jenna reacting the way she did is a reflection on her, not you.", "This is one of the themes from the movie The Squid and the Whale.\n\nTina = Jesse Eisenberg. But Jesse's mom and the school he lied to weren't happy about it.", "NTA for pointing it out privately and your sister overreacted. But I think you're overreacting a bit too. A 7-year-old doesn't really know what it means to have \"written\" a song, most likely, and isn't plagiarizing on purpose. And it's not necessarily a pattern that she's going to continue as an adult.", "NTA. I wonder if the mom is the one who spread the like the song was written by Tina. \n\nTina probably just wanted to sing and the mom wanted to have a even \"better\" daughter who knows how to write songs. What tipped me off was a song from the 2000s. Idk about you but when I was 7 I listened to only the newest songs, not songs that came out more than 2 decades ago", "NTA.  I think Jenna is waaay too invested in her child\u2019s genius.  And I find it odd that a 7 year old plagiarizes songs from over 20 years ago.  Honey, I think Jenna helped her daughter write those original songs.  Hence her overreaction.", "NTA", "[removed]", "[removed]", "[removed]", "If Jenna wants to keep arguing about it, OP might want to point out that no one remembers who Milli Vanilli's moms are.\n\nOP, you are NTA.

It\u2019s easier to say I have to pick my niece up from school and takes her to girls scouts instead of my lifelong friends daughter. Also, I view them and treat them as my nieces.", "Also just in general try to not always look at kids\u2019 behaviors as the beginning of a huge pattern or an indicator of what they\u2019ll do in the future. Kids are too weird for that. Obviously course corrections are needed along the way but not for everything. Lying is developmentally normal for a 7 y/o and it\u2019s usually suggested to reframe their statements as a story they\u2019re telling rather than just telling them to stop lying. Not that you did that here, just for perspective on what you\u2019re concerned about. Also it\u2019s ok to let their peers be the ones to call them out. As long as it\u2019s not overt bullying, negative reactions or a simple call-outs from peers are a vital social learning experiences.\n\nEdit for typos", "I get your point. I was just trying to imagine her perspective considering the apparent intensity of Jenna\u2019s reaction. I\u2019m guessing she thought you were telling her to call her kid out.

But thanks!", "The way to describe all these relations in English is long and annoying and many native speakers don\u2019t understand how the whole removed thing works. Niece was a fine choice here, I think. We all understood the basic status of the relationship.", "You're fine. Aunt/niece may not be the literal genetic connection, but it describes the type of relationship you have with the child. I have an uncle who's only 2 years older than me. Growing up he always referred to me as his cousin because that's what our relationship felt like. Unless you're trying to make a family history chart, it really doesn't matter.\n\nAlso, NTA. You handled the song situation really well. Jenna's probably just embarrassed and deflecting that on to you. Hopefully she'll get over it soon.", "NTA - children need to learn asap that getting praise by doing something wrong is not the way to go. You did it the right way too, without putting her on blast and just telling mom. It's too bad it seems mom wants to enable the behavior. This will backfire on Tina if she does this in public. Hopefully she doesn't repeat it and her mom has a discussion with her.", "NTA that\u2019s plagiarism. She\u2019s seems like a good kid from what you said and this is a lesson she needs to learn. If they don\u2019t learn it now they will learn it later with repercussions.", "YTA- if it was repeated occurrence sure, but one time lie. It doesn't define her character enough to make a deal about it.\n\nYou mentioned great kid, But then you use the word - obedient. That's kind of interesting, not exactly something that would be used as a description for a kid. If anything it kind of denotes the parenting style.\n\n You did talk privately to the mom, which on the surface seems good. But considering how fast and hard the mom turned with an explosive and defensive reaction, I do not think in the future you should talk with her. Instead talk with the kid about not plagiarizing. I'm not sure what kind of pressure the kid is under, if any. But it does seem like the kid was under creative pressure to perform.", "NTA.i cringe at the \"songs\" i wrote at that age. Just a mix of random songs id heard \ud83d\ude48", "NTA, but what song was it?", "NAH except maybe the mother...   \nThey do dumb things like this at 7.  \nI'd be more concerned about why? Does she feel starved for attention? Is she under a lot of pressure and feels the need to overcompensate like this?", "my guess is jenna told her to do this because of her reaction\u2026. also seems a bit unlikely a 7 year older could go on the internet and out of millions of songs choose ones that not a lot of people know \u2026 like knowingly", "Yeah, I was wondering something similar. It's been a while since my kids were that young, so maybe I just don't remember, but the idea of a 7 yr old going online and looking up old songs to copy doesn't quite sit right.", "This is what I thought as well. My six year old kid knows a lot of music but to specifically find a couple of songs from 20 years ago that weren't very popular so she can plagiarize them is beyond her. She wouldn't even have the context to know what was popular or not. I would bet mom did a lot of the writing (stealing) and was so aggressive about it because she didn't want to admit any of it.", "good point\n\nOTOH, you never know what's going on with kids. My brother used to claim that he had made up jokes -- probably up to his late pre-teens. He seemed to believe that he'd made them once he said it. I would quash his heart by giving the punchline (sibling rivalry?), and every single time, he'd say that I couldn't have known that because he had JUST MADE UP THE JOKE. At the time, I thought he was being obnoxious (I'm only a year older), but now I wonder whether he did think the joke was his as soon as he claimed it. \n\nAnyway, OP: NTA", "I question whether a seven year old even yet has the capacity to realize that plagiarism is technically lying/theft.  She's got only a vague idea of what being a writer is like, she reads/listens to something she loves, she knows that writers create things like that... the fact that writers need to do original work may well not have quite made it into her developing brain.  It's not a negative reflection on either her or her mom, at this age... she just needs to be taught not to.\n\nSo your sis overreacted and you are NTA.  I'd love to know what the songs were, if you cared to share.", "This makes the most sense to me. 7-year-olds aren't digging around YouTube for obscure songs from 2003 to pretend they wrote them. But Jenna is just the right age that these could have been songs she liked as a teen.", "yta", "NTA\n\nJenna probably gave her those songs to impress you.", "I have an 8 year old daughter and can confirm, the most normal reaction would be to laugh at the absurdity of the situation, including my own blind pride. It happens to all of us.", "My little brother claimed to invent Barry Craig, private investigator when he was about 7. We were duly impressed until we figured out that he had probably gotten it from a collection of cassette tapes with recordings from the golden age of radio. He probably listened to it and liked the sound of it and just kinda forgot he didn\u2019t actually come up with it. He even did the voices and the pacing the same, kid was a natural mimic", "NTA. Compulsive liars suck. I don\u2019t know exactly how it starts but it\u2019s best to be safe."]}
