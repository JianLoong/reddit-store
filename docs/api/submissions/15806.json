As you said in the post, it's ideal to teach these things to children while they're young. Plagiarism isn't good and although it's harmless right now since she's only young, if she really does pursue writing as a career it's best to teach her now instead of her having to learn the hard way as an adult.", "NTA - assuming you pulled the mother aside quietly and privately and let her know.", "NTA, its a minor deal now because she is only 7 and doesnt know any better. But unless someone teaches her the proper way to go about this, it couls turn into a bigger issue.\n\nPotential futures aside, you merely pointed it out to her mom.. didnt even confront your niece or attempted to berate her so the moms reaction is extremely out of proportion", "NTA, and i don't understand Jenna's reaction at all. I would be glad to know if I knew for sure the stuff my kid says he did were really his idea or his doing.", "NTA - You did this exactly the right way. Told Jenna the truth without humiliating her kid.\n\nthe reality is that, if you didn't, it could lead to your niece getting called out in front of a lot more people. Imagine a scenario where Jenna proudly tells a group of friends? It only takes one to know the song and say something.", "NTA, Jenna should be thanking you, but of course she had to go the \u201cMy child can do no wrong!\u201d route, which doesn\u2019t bode well.", "NTA. Your cousin needs to talk to her daughter and explain what's right and wrong here.", "NTA - You didn't call out the child in front of everyone and you were just trying to prevent a bad habit from getting formed.", "NTA. I will say that things like this happen all the time with kids tho. I\u2019m a nursery teacher and kids make up all sorts of stories. It\u2019s pretty common. If it\u2019s something that she does as she gets older then it would be cause for concern, but for now I wouldn\u2019t worry too much.", "So you privately told her mom and you didn't humiliate your niece? You are NTA.", "NTA. Facts that care about her feelings. 10 points to you good... ummm... person!", "NTA But it would have been totally funny if you had pulled up the lyrics and started singing along halfway through the song. I think you should talk to your niece, because you know mommy didn't. Just tell her she is a really great singer and you love to listen to her singing but that people who write songs work really hard on them so it is not okay to say you made/wrote something and you didn't, somebody else did. Then tell her when she really writes a song you would love to hear it, maybe even ask if she can put a pet or special toy mentioned in her song. Also, it is very possible that mommy helped her \"write\" these songs so her daughter could impress people", "INFO: how old are you??? and what were the songs?\n\nLike okay so she's 7 and plagiarized a couple of songs from the early 2000's that her mom should probably know of since she's 34, but like... it's not that big of a deal. It's not like she's suddenly going to continue to plagarize people's work and get away with it... She's 7 years old... Seems kinda petty on your part \"because she's never been into music.\" Kids have a plethora of interests so why did that bother you so much? Her mom getting mad is weird as hell just from you saying \"hey actually she didn't write those songs.\"\n\nIDK the whole situation is just so weird overall. It was such a non-issue.", "ESH. That\u2019s not a reason to yell at you for sure. I also don\u2019t think any 7 y/o isn\u2019t a liar. She\u2019s probably not going to become a writer because there\u2019s no way a 7 y/o understands what they want in life and they definitely don\u2019t understand plagiarism. \nthey\u2019re learning to understand the world still and they don\u2019t have a grasp on anything. \nDon\u2019t think she should have yelled at you at all because that\u2019s uncalled for, but it\u2019s not exactly like it\u2019s a big deal. My little cousin lied for a very very long time as a kid, and she has become very thoughtful as a 13 year old. Totally mellowed out, and very calm now  while caring heavily about morals. But she wouldn\u2019t have understood shit when she was 7 if she was singing a song to me that she claimed to write. I don\u2019t think we should have high moral standards for kids that young yet, but I also don\u2019t think that the reaction from your family is warranted", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You Talk to her mother in privated, you dont make a scene or ridiculice your niece or sonethink like that. You only tell the truh to her because that way she can Talk with your niece un plublic and prevent this to apend again and cause future problems.", "Agree. You pulled the mom into a separate room to tell her. Maybe she was just embarrassed that she had bragged about her daughter\u2019s talent? Still, I think you did the right thing.", "Pretty sure she was implying the sister isn\u2019t into music, and therefore would never have noticed the songs were not original creations from the niece. OP already clearly stated niece is creative so her writing songs was not out of the norm at all.", "While the situation in itself is small and kinda harmless, I agree with OP, it\u2019s best to talk to kids about lying right away, before it\u2019ll become a bigger issue later on.", "I didn't intend to prove that she's a liar. I pointed it out because I thought that it's something my cousin needed to know.", "I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s anything wrong with what you said, I just also don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big enough deal. I agree that Jenna\u2019s reaction was out of proportion and that makes her an AH. I also don\u2019t think it was something you needed to read into too much", "Out of curiosity, why did you think it was something she \u2018needed to know\u2019. Kid didn\u2019t plagiarize a doctoral thesis, she\u2019s seven years old. Kids fabricate, they\u2019re fantasists, they make stuff up, it\u2019s just\u2026meaningless. I don\u2019t get your schoolmarmish taking her aside schtick to set her straight, like, why? Who cares? Clap along and pat the kid on the head. Maybe at some later time you say, hey cuz, you know, she didn\u2019t really make those songs up herself, but why go out of your way to squash the kid and the mother in the moment? It\u2019s not a great look for an adult, by which I mean you.", "So you wait until a doctoral thesis is plagiarized to confront? No, you set the tone for honesty when they are kids. This wasn\u2019t just fantasy - fantasy is when it\u2019s obvious to everyone that it is a fantasy, like if the kid said \u201cI have a pet dragon!\u201d Here she said she wrote a song, which she clearly didn\u2019t.", "I personally believe that if kids aren't taught these things at a young age, they grow up, and get thrashed by life. As someone who loves their niece, I thought the best thing to do is let my cousin be aware of the situation. Although I agree that it wasn't a big deal, it might be something that could help her. Also, neither did I squash the kid nor the mother. As I clearly mentioned in the post, I pulled Jenna into the kitchen and showed it to her. Because if I were a mother, I would want to know if something is wrong, be it as insignificant as my kid making stuff up.", "No.You correctly and privately pointed it out. Let her deal with it. NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t bring it up in front of everyone else. You just made her mom aware of it. Definitely something that should have been appreciated and handled in private by mom later.", "I\u2019ll go with NTA but with a caveat. I have kids and I have a niece. When she was around 7 I treated her like my kids. If she was misbehaving I would point it out. If she lied I called her on it. While I don\u2019t think I was being an AH, now that she\u2019s a preteen I can tell you it has damaged my relationship with her. Uncles are supposed to be fun. It\u2019s not your job to parent her. I am now trying to be more easy going with her and be more fun and it\u2019s making a difference. So while NTA, you need to decide what kind of uncle you want to be and if you\u2019d rather be right and ostracized or keep your mouth shut and let her have fun.", "NTA it starts small. And she could get arrested and fined. \n\nEDIT-Spelling error", "NTA... her mom is wrong to be angry.  She should be talking to her daughter.  Her over reaction is very disturbing.   You went about it correctly.  I hate liars and would never co sign a lie for someone.", "INFO is \"Tina\" is your niece then isn't \"Jenna\" your sister?  How do your other family members know about this--did Jenna tell them or did you?", "Nta", "That stood out to me as well- the way she reacted do you think the mom \"helped\" her daughter write the songs? Then she could brag about her precocious song-writer daughter? Hmmm...", "If Jenna is her cousin, then Tina isn't her niece.", "oh that would explain why she flipped out at being found out!! damn \n\ni think OP and niece should write a song together. maybe something about how lying is bad \ud83d\ude05", "But OP didn't call out T on her lie. She pulled Jenna aside & told her, so unless Jenna tells T, how will T find out about OP's involvement? NTA, OP", "Jenna is my cousin. \n\nAfter what happened at her place, she apparently had a conversation with one of our other cousins in our family, telling them I called Tina a liar. \n\nThe whole family got to know about that shortly after. Yesterday, my mom called me, and said I was in the wrong for \"calling Tina a liar\". I clarified what had happened, and she still thinks I was wrong for not going along with it. The entire family seems to think the same thing.", "I'm not a mother but I would find it funny.. and not be embarrassed? like, /facepalm/ \"i cant believe it! here i am thinking my kid is a creative genius, now you tell me she's conning me. oh my god my daughter is a con artist... you know what yeah, still genius!\" \n\ni mean as long as it's a private conversation. sometimes kids do dumb things thinking they're being smart and if you find it funny it might genuinely upset them. like you're laughing *at them* it's a delicate thing to handle but.. i think it's definitely a teaching moment, not screaming-at-cousin moment lol", "I agree. I also said NTA. I just thought it was worth providing a perspective that maybe he hadn\u2019t thought of. I thought I was doing the right thing until I realized I\u2019d done some damage to my relationships through my good intentions. At the very least, OP definitely did some damage in his relationship with his cousin.", "Thanks for clarifying--- it was kind of confusing and I thought you'd left someone out of the story.  While personally, I would not have brought up the incident while still at the party, there was nothing wrong with bringing it up later with Jenna just to put it on her radar.  She may have felt confronted by you jumping on it while the party was still going on and she didn't have time/space to process.  \n\nGetting the rest of the family involved was a total AH move on Jenna's part-- and in the long term only serves to further embarrass Tina.   At seven not all kids have the same black and white view of truth and lies that adults have.  They are still in many ways drawn in by fantasy and it's likely that Tina as a 7 year old saw nothing wrong with saying she wrote the song.  I would hesitate to call her a \"liar\" but what she said was not true.  (It's also entirely possible that Jenna already knew Tina wasn't telling the truth but that's a whole other can of worms.)", "Then Tina isn't your niece. Tina would only be your niece if she was the daughter of one of your siblings."]}
