Jenna was really happy because apparently Tina told her that she wrote a couple of songs. Tina is a very creative kid, so it wasn't unusual for her to create something like that, since she said she wants to be a writer when she grows up. Tina sang 2 of them in front of us, and something wasn't adding up. So I googled the lyrics, and found out that the songs are from the early 2000s. And since they weren't that popular, it would be hard for people to notice at first. While Jenna was praising her daughter, I decided that I should tell her the truth, since she's never been much into music. I pulled her in the kitchen and played one of the songs on YouTube.

As you said in the post, it's ideal to teach these things to children while they're young. Plagiarism isn't good and although it's harmless right now since she's only young, if she really does pursue writing as a career it's best to teach her now instead of her having to learn the hard way as an adult.", "NTA - assuming you pulled the mother aside quietly and privately and let her know.", "NTA, its a minor deal now because she is only 7 and doesnt know any better. But unless someone teaches her the proper way to go about this, it couls turn into a bigger issue.\n\nPotential futures aside, you merely pointed it out to her mom.. didnt even confront your niece or attempted to berate her so the moms reaction is extremely out of proportion", "NTA, and i don't understand Jenna's reaction at all. I would be glad to know if I knew for sure the stuff my kid says he did were really his idea or his doing.", "NTA - You did this exactly the right way. Told Jenna the truth without humiliating her kid.\n\nthe reality is that, if you didn't, it could lead to your niece getting called out in front of a lot more people. Imagine a scenario where Jenna proudly tells a group of friends? It only takes one to know the song and say something.", "NTA, Jenna should be thanking you, but of course she had to go the \u201cMy child can do no wrong!\u201d route, which doesn\u2019t bode well.", "NTA. Your cousin needs to talk to her daughter and explain what's right and wrong here.", "NTA - You didn't call out the child in front of everyone and you were just trying to prevent a bad habit from getting formed.", "NTA. I will say that things like this happen all the time with kids tho. I\u2019m a nursery teacher and kids make up all sorts of stories. It\u2019s pretty common. If it\u2019s something that she does as she gets older then it would be cause for concern, but for now I wouldn\u2019t worry too much.", "So you privately told her mom and you didn't humiliate your niece? You are NTA.", "NTA. Facts that care about her feelings. 10 points to you good... ummm... person!", "NTA But it would have been totally funny if you had pulled up the lyrics and started singing along halfway through the song. I think you should talk to your niece, because you know mommy didn't. Just tell her she is a really great singer and you love to listen to her singing but that people who write songs work really hard on them so it is not okay to say you made/wrote something and you didn't, somebody else did. Then tell her when she really writes a song you would love to hear it, maybe even ask if she can put a pet or special toy mentioned in her song. Also, it is very possible that mommy helped her \"write\" these songs so her daughter could impress people", "INFO: how old are you??? and what were the songs?\n\nLike okay so she's 7 and plagiarized a couple of songs from the early 2000's that her mom should probably know of since she's 34, but like... it's not that big of a deal. It's not like she's suddenly going to continue to plagarize people's work and get away with it... She's 7 years old... Seems kinda petty on your part \"because she's never been into music.\" Kids have a plethora of interests so why did that bother you so much? Her mom getting mad is weird as hell just from you saying \"hey actually she didn't write those songs.\"\n\nIDK the whole situation is just so weird overall. It was such a non-issue.", "ESH. That\u2019s not a reason to yell at you for sure. I also don\u2019t think any 7 y/o isn\u2019t a liar. She\u2019s probably not going to become a writer because there\u2019s no way a 7 y/o understands what they want in life and they definitely don\u2019t understand plagiarism. \nthey\u2019re learning to understand the world still and they don\u2019t have a grasp on anything. \nDon\u2019t think she should have yelled at you at all because that\u2019s uncalled for, but it\u2019s not exactly like it\u2019s a big deal. My little cousin lied for a very very long time as a kid, and she has become very thoughtful as a 13 year old. Totally mellowed out, and very calm now  while caring heavily about morals. But she wouldn\u2019t have understood shit when she was 7 if she was singing a song to me that she claimed to write. I don\u2019t think we should have high moral standards for kids that young yet, but I also don\u2019t think that the reaction from your family is warranted", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You Talk to her mother in privated, you dont make a scene or ridiculice your niece or sonethink like that. You only tell the truh to her because that way she can Talk with your niece un plublic and prevent this to apend again and cause future problems.", "Agree. You pulled the mom into a separate room to tell her. Maybe she was just embarrassed that she had bragged about her daughter\u2019s talent? Still, I think you did the right thing.", "Pretty sure she was implying the sister isn\u2019t into music, and therefore would never have noticed the songs were not original creations from the niece. OP already clearly stated niece is creative so her writing songs was not out of the norm at all.", "While the situation in itself is small and kinda harmless, I agree with OP, it\u2019s best to talk to kids about lying right away, before it\u2019ll become a bigger issue later on.", "I didn't intend to prove that she's a liar. I pointed it out because I thought that it's something my cousin needed to know.", "I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s anything wrong with what you said, I just also don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big enough deal. I agree that Jenna\u2019s reaction was out of proportion and that makes her an AH. I also don\u2019t think it was something you needed to read into too much", "Out of curiosity, why did you think it was something she \u2018needed to know\u2019. Kid didn\u2019t plagiarize a doctoral thesis, she\u2019s seven years old. Kids fabricate, they\u2019re fantasists, they make stuff up, it\u2019s just\u2026meaningless. I don\u2019t get your schoolmarmish taking her aside schtick to set her straight, like, why? Who cares? Clap along and pat the kid on the head. Maybe at some later time you say, hey cuz, you know, she didn\u2019t really make those songs up herself, but why go out of your way to squash the kid and the mother in the moment? It\u2019s not a great look for an adult, by which I mean you.", "So you wait until a doctoral thesis is plagiarized to confront? No, you set the tone for honesty when they are kids. This wasn\u2019t just fantasy - fantasy is when it\u2019s obvious to everyone that it is a fantasy, like if the kid said \u201cI have a pet dragon!\u201d Here she said she wrote a song, which she clearly didn\u2019t.", "I personally believe that if kids aren't taught these things at a young age, they grow up, and get thrashed by life. As someone who loves their niece, I thought the best thing to do is let my cousin be aware of the situation. Although I agree that it wasn't a big deal, it might be something that could help her. Also, neither did I squash the kid nor the mother. As I clearly mentioned in the post, I pulled Jenna into the kitchen and showed it to her. Because if I were a mother, I would want to know if something is wrong, be it as insignificant as my kid making stuff up."]}
