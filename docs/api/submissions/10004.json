Y\u2019all don\u2019t have to live her life, where she could be labeled a \u201cwavered girl\u201d, lose ALL her marriage prospects, be dishonoured in front of her family etc. Bangladesh is a place where everyday there are multiple human rights violations, where women don\u2019t have the kind of autonomy you all are used to, and family honour is extremely important, and in some cases worth dying for. Why are y\u2019all encouraging her to put herself out there? Some battles are NOT worth fighting, and THIS is one of them. This girl\u2019s life could potentially be ruined if she doesn\u2019t pull out of this stuff. In Bangladesh, premarital sex is a SIN !!!!!!!! We logically know that there is nothing shameful about sex or birth control products- in fact, they are good and useful, but we don\u2019t have to live her life in a highly corrupt, patriarchal and backwards third world country!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n    Y\u2019all amaze me sometimes. Let the girl get her marriage fixed and her family off her back!!! This shit is not worth screwing her life up over. Unless any of y\u2019all are volunteering to bring her to North America and set her life up for her and help her start anew in a foreign country, I don\u2019t see why any of you don\u2019t get it. \n\nAnd honestly, please stop shaming her- there is a way to say that her mentality is wrong, but this is not it. The way children are raised in a subcontinental country can be very dogmatic and scary, and she has been brainwashed into equating sex with shame. This will take years to unlearn, neither should SHE become a martyr for the cause and ruin her life. \n\nOnto the legal stuff- if your money is protected by clauses and you can pull it out at any time, go ahead and tell your friend you will pull it out if she sells sex stuff. It is really not worth the backlash and social isolation, ridicule and abandonment you will face if found out. \n\nI would work on my mentality in private, try and understand your sexuality and the sexuality of others more, and try to marry a marriage prospect that is not so backwards. Once you are married, you can do as you see fit imo, and live your life freely. I know that sucks and it shouldn\u2019t be like this, but sometimes it is what it is.", "NAH as your culture and current situation makes this situation awkward. It was, however, bad business not to take an ownership in her company when you provided 80% of the capital. You might need to explain that generosity to a new spouse and their family.\n\nA compromise re the business would be for her to start a new company specifically selling these products, separate from the one you funded. She\u2019s intending to leave the country so, presumably, will either be selling the business or shutting it down relatively soon, anyway.\n\nEdited: Gender", "While I do not agree with your views, IWBTA for trying to judge you in this situation. My western culture is very different to yours. Sex is not shameful here. We also have the privilege of being able to take about sex, have access to education, birth control and (some) reproductive rights. Some people can actually lose their lives over things like this around the world.", "YTA. Bangladesh, huh? Low population numbers? Low sex crime numbers? Sounds like your friend would be doing a service selling condoms & Plan B. Women need access to these items all over the world. Help break the generational cycle of keeping the poor, poor. People are having sex with or without your friend's contribution. She is helping people be responsible members of society. Religion is a tool used to keep people down, don't contribute to that by pulling your funding from your friend.", "Info: since you say she wants to sell these items discreetly, does that mean they\u2019re not allowed to be sold where you live?", "NAH. So, you live in a country where sexual things before marriage is seen as immoral, I assume, and you're worried being associated with it is going to damage your reputation and marriage prospects. That's valid. It's horrible that that's the reality you live in, but if you're trying to make sure you end up married to someone who treats you with respect and the country you're in holds those things to a high standard, I can't blame you for wanting to distance yourself from those things. Plus it's your money, you can choose where it goes and you can choose to take it back.\n\nAt the same time, your friend is catering to people who maybe want to engage in these perfectly normal feelings in a healthy way. Being able to provide people with contraception is brilliant even if you dislike being attached to it; safe sexual activity to stop the spread of STIs and pregnancies is very much a good thing. And if there's a market for it, your friend is just following the money, which is a good thing to do in business. So I don't think either of you are wrong.\n\nObjectively they're not shameful though, and it might be a positive move to remind yourself that these items are perfectly normal and part of a perfectly normal aspect of life, even if they're not things you personally want to be associated with.", "Providing a discreet and reliable source of these things is not shameful. It\u2019s good business sense to sell what customers are asking for.", "Info: What exactly is wrong with those items?", "[deleted]", "NAH. Condoms aren't shameful. They prevent diseases and expensive unwanted babies, that's a *good* thing. She should sell *more* of them to university kids. Kids around the world could use a late night condom delivery person, to be honest. It's enterprising.\n\nYou are well within your rights to stop working for her at any time, and you can ask for your money back for whatever reason you want. \n\nHowever, do you really want to destroy a friendship over her choice to expand her business by adding safe protection? Think about it, really. Go ahead and make a clean break so that you can be married off, but maybe request a payment plan so that your girl can continue her work.", "NTA, while your morals sound more than a little conservative, especially for a Reddit audience, you are allowed to hold whatever moral beliefs you want. I also assume you are from a country where values are conservative and probably strongly tied to relgion.\n\nIf you don't have any prior contract or agreement with this friend, you can withdraw the money for whatever reason you want. If you do not like the products sold or how your name is tied to the reputation of the business, you have the right to pull out.", "INFO: where are you from", "INFO: do you legally have a say in what she does with her business? And can you legally take your money back once you've already given it?", "This is a wild ride.\nI'm guessing you're in India or at least the eastern psrt of the world?

The lack of them won't stop people having s*x, just forvce them to take risks for nothing.\nAlso, labelling them shameful? That says more about you than anything else. \nAnd further, if there's a demand for these things and selling them would improve her businesses wouldn't your support for a successful business reflect POSITIVELY on you? \nOr are you more interested in forcing your own morals onto others than you are in supporting a friend? Because ultimately, this is what it will boil down to. Nothing and noone is forcing you to use these things or impede on your own morals. \n\nFrankly, your prude personal views are severly outdated and your willingness to risk your friends' business and education over this is kind of unsettling. You are ofcourse in your full right to remove the funds, but YWBTA.\n\nETA - further comments regarding friends education as I missed that. \n\nETA2 - if your friend is considering selling these items and you've labelled thwm shameful to her, then in all likelyhood you've already labelled her shameful as well.

That's a cultural difference that I have trouble getting over lol.\n\nHonestly seems like you already decided to end your friendship with her by labelling what she does as \"shameful\".

It seems like you are in a very, very conservative part of the world, to the point where a 26 year old woman is ashamed of even naming things that have to do with the taboo of human sexuality. Your friend has the right idea, because humans will have sex and they will explore their bodies, no matter how much shame there is, she is only giving them the option to not catch any diseases and avoid injuries. Your main concern is not your friend selling condoms, lube, plan b and sex toys, but your parents' punishment and shame, which quite honestly makes me feel so sad for you. And with the arranged marriage bit, you might have to face the reality of humanity sooner or latter. OP, do you really want to get married like that?", "NTA, you are entitled to your own values and opinions.

I personally do not  believe that any of these things are shameful, although I wouldn't go to my corner store for toys! I'm not sure what the B after porn stands for, but I think most people would go online for the latter. \n\nAll that being said, you have a right to your beliefs, and the culture in your country may also be informing your decision, so you gave a right to voice your concerns. \n\nYTA if you just pull funding, and this probably wouldn't help your reputation as those people who know you have invested will not realise you have pulled your investment unless you tell them which will just draw attention to the situation and make more people aware of your involvement. Also, this might just be grammar, but you said you gave her the money rather than loaned her the money. Is there a repayment plan? You have no ownership of the business, so you have a say in how ahe runs it? Could you discuss terms to slowly reduce your investment and say she is free to sell what she wants when she has paid you back?", "NTA, but Reddit was the wrong place to ask. These people hate religion.", "I\u2019d go soft YTA. It\u2019s hard to say you\u2019re genuinely the AH here because it sounds like you hold the belief that these are \u201cshameful\u201d items due to your upbringing, religion and cultural opinions. The thing is, everywhere is different. It\u2019s part of your culture to have arranged marriage, whereas to a lot of places the idea of marrying someone your parents picks out is just madness. You then bring shame upon your family if you don\u2019t make it work, irrespective of how that person treats you. Do you see my point? \n\nUltimately everyone needs to be more accepting of what is normal in different cultures. These \u201cshameful\u201d items are normal in a lot of cultures so you have to expect to come across them in life. \n\nIf I were you, I\u2019d just take a backwards step from the business.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

South Asia is changing. \n\nThese things aren\u2019t immoral. This lady finds it immoral as well btw. She is YTA for that. \nShe is a university going person who has enough financial independence to be investing in a friends business. She isn\u2019t some disconnected lady", "It's not going to get better unless people fight back. She asked for my opinion I gave it. I did not ask for yours.", "Okay so very few people know that you **used to** be involved, but you\u2019re not involved now? \n\nIf she\u2019s making that move after you\u2019re no longer involved in the business it has nothing to do with you\n\nAlso in reply to your actual question on this sub:\n\n> gave her around 80% of the starting capital to get going. I have no ownership stake in the business.\n\n> I don't expect anything from her, and I did all this as a favour to her. \n\n**You gave her a gift.** It wasn\u2019t a loan or a share in the business. Trying to take back a gift is always an AH move.", "Unless you're famous I doubt anyone is thinking about you.", "You have no ownership in the company, so you can\u2019t tell her what she can and can\u2019t sell. You have her money to start her company. If you want absolutely no ties to it and have the ability to back up your claim of no ties, you need to get her to pay back the entire amount you gave. \n\nAlso, there is absolutely no shame in having/delivering those products. If anything it\u2019s a GOOD thing people are wanting those products. It can not only work to break the stigma\u2014which you are perpetuating by being appalled she wants to sell items that aren\u2019t shameful\u2014but will also promote safe sex practices. Less STIs and unplanned pregnancies.", "Ya you aren\u2019t as rural as you think if you actually think everyone isn\u2019t already sniffing your shit. \n\nThat ship has sailed.\n\nEveryone knows already, your fault for not figuring out what you were helping with. \n\nBoo hoo", "Where in Australia is sex shamed? I only see if shamed in religious institutions. We literally have \u201csexpo\u201d conventions here", "Lol so because you and your friends are weird means the entire country is? Get real.", "Pretty easy to tell other people to fight back and assume all the risk, while sitting comfortably behind your computer with NO skin in the game.", "Its her to decide if she wants to 'fight back' you have no idea about the consequences of doing things which people consider taboo in these countries. If she does not want to be part of this then she is not wrong.", "Hope you inboxed her your address then! Happy to know you\u2019ll be sponsoring her through her \u201cfight back\u201d \ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd73", "[removed]", "OP states elsewhere it was a personal loan for which the have an agreement which doesn\u2019t include a stake in the business. It wasn\u2019t a gift.", "Nah nah nah. I\u2019m not from where op is but I\u2019m from an area where the aunties know when you have your period. Because they are nosey. \n\nOp fucked up by not fully understanding what she was backing and asking for money back is going to do nothing because everyone already knows who she gave money to. \n\nIf she asks for the money back then it\u2019s just gonna stir up more drama and give people more to talk about", "i live in the adelaide hills. not adelaide. our community is either young people or people over 50 and it\u2019s the people over 50 who shake us", "not me and my friends. my friends talk openly about sex it\u2019s the older generations that shame us", "Your comment has been removed because it violates [Rule 1: Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/). Further incidents may result in a ban.\n\n[\"Why do I have to be civil in a sub about assholes?\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_civility)\n\n**[Message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.**", "Okay but my comment was based on her post which is what I had available at the time. She should have included that in the post", "You're straight delusional if you think this is 1% as bad as what can happen in Bangladesh.", "I live in the Adelaide Hills too and you are way way off. Why are random hills dwellers shaming you?", "i don\u2019t think it is. i\u2019m simply saying. that sex is shamed", "nah barker. i don\u2019t know why they do they just do", "I've never experienced this in my time in Barker, not even in the more higher income areas. So strange.", "it\u2019s mostly from older people. i have a family of 18 plus friends all over 50 so that could highly influence my opinion"]}
