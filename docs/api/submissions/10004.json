I have no ownership stake in the business.\n\nI don't expect anything from her, and I did all this as a favour to her.

My parents have started looking into marriage proposals for me, so I don't want my name being dirtied at this time. Even if my name wasn't being dragged into those kinds of things, I would still be very uncomfortable with just my money being used to deal with those kinds of things.\n\nI immediately said no to her, but she didn't seem happy about it and wants me to reconsider.\n\nThis is all very new for me as I didn't think she would consider selling them, it has made me see her in a different light and I don't think I can continue to support her with a clear conscience.\n\nI am tempted to ask my money back, but I feel like it will be a bad move. My initial amount is still worth about half of the companies current capital. She is also planning to persue a masters in the USA next year and she is using the money from this business to show financial for the visa. If I ask for my money back, it might be a set back to her. I really don't want to do that, but I cannot continue supporting her in good faith.\n\nI know that if I ask for my money, it might be the end of my friendship.\n\nEdit:\n\nBecause the amount of money was large, I gave it to her with a notorised contract to protect myself. Legally, I have the right to ask for the money. Either I can ask for it all back with a three month notice or I can ask for a schedule.\n\nBefore this, I never intended to ask for even a cent back and always intended to write it off (essentially making it into something like a gift)\n\nI will not be asking for any money back for both our sakes.\n\nBut I made it clear to her that she should do her activities discretely so that my name would not even be marginally involved in those kinds of activities.\n\nI also made it clear that I would not help her further.\n\nEdit, Why I dont want my name associated with those kinds of stuff--\n\nGossip here travels quite fast. \n\nMy family is a rural family, not an urban one. If any of my relatives learn that I have any kind of involvement in buying and selling those kinds of stuff, they will massively pressure my parents to disown me. Also I will be known as a loose girl in some of my my social circles. It will be very hard to get a job or even a place to rent in the same area.

Y\u2019all don\u2019t have to live her life, where she could be labeled a \u201cwavered girl\u201d, lose ALL her marriage prospects, be dishonoured in front of her family etc. Bangladesh is a place where everyday there are multiple human rights violations, where women don\u2019t have the kind of autonomy you all are used to, and family honour is extremely important, and in some cases worth dying for. Why are y\u2019all encouraging her to put herself out there? Some battles are NOT worth fighting, and THIS is one of them. This girl\u2019s life could potentially be ruined if she doesn\u2019t pull out of this stuff. In Bangladesh, premarital sex is a SIN !!!!!!!! We logically know that there is nothing shameful about sex or birth control products- in fact, they are good and useful, but we don\u2019t have to live her life in a highly corrupt, patriarchal and backwards third world country!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n    Y\u2019all amaze me sometimes. Let the girl get her marriage fixed and her family off her back!!! This shit is not worth screwing her life up over. Unless any of y\u2019all are volunteering to bring her to North America and set her life up for her and help her start anew in a foreign country, I don\u2019t see why any of you don\u2019t get it. \n\nAnd honestly, please stop shaming her- there is a way to say that her mentality is wrong, but this is not it. The way children are raised in a subcontinental country can be very dogmatic and scary, and she has been brainwashed into equating sex with shame. This will take years to unlearn, neither should SHE become a martyr for the cause and ruin her life. \n\nOnto the legal stuff- if your money is protected by clauses and you can pull it out at any time, go ahead and tell your friend you will pull it out if she sells sex stuff. It is really not worth the backlash and social isolation, ridicule and abandonment you will face if found out. \n\nI would work on my mentality in private, try and understand your sexuality and the sexuality of others more, and try to marry a marriage prospect that is not so backwards. Once you are married, you can do as you see fit imo, and live your life freely. I know that sucks and it shouldn\u2019t be like this, but sometimes it is what it is.", "NAH as your culture and current situation makes this situation awkward. It was, however, bad business not to take an ownership in her company when you provided 80% of the capital. You might need to explain that generosity to a new spouse and their family.\n\nA compromise re the business would be for her to start a new company specifically selling these products, separate from the one you funded. She\u2019s intending to leave the country so, presumably, will either be selling the business or shutting it down relatively soon, anyway.\n\nEdited: Gender", "While I do not agree with your views, IWBTA for trying to judge you in this situation. My western culture is very different to yours. Sex is not shameful here. We also have the privilege of being able to take about sex, have access to education, birth control and (some) reproductive rights. Some people can actually lose their lives over things like this around the world.", "YTA. Bangladesh, huh? Low population numbers? Low sex crime numbers? Sounds like your friend would be doing a service selling condoms & Plan B. Women need access to these items all over the world. Help break the generational cycle of keeping the poor, poor. People are having sex with or without your friend's contribution. She is helping people be responsible members of society. Religion is a tool used to keep people down, don't contribute to that by pulling your funding from your friend.\n\nEveryone saying: I don't know now what it's like. The OP asked for opinions, I gave mine. She doesn't have to take my opinion seriously. I don't think you understand how this Reddit works. If things are really as bad for her as you seem to think, why didn't she just pull her money and distance herself from her friend?", "Info: since you say she wants to sell these items discreetly, does that mean they\u2019re not allowed to be sold where you live?", "NAH. So, you live in a country where sexual things before marriage is seen as immoral, I assume, and you're worried being associated with it is going to damage your reputation and marriage prospects. That's valid. It's horrible that that's the reality you live in, but if you're trying to make sure you end up married to someone who treats you with respect and the country you're in holds those things to a high standard, I can't blame you for wanting to distance yourself from those things. Plus it's your money, you can choose where it goes and you can choose to take it back.\n\nAt the same time, your friend is catering to people who maybe want to engage in these perfectly normal feelings in a healthy way. Being able to provide people with contraception is brilliant even if you dislike being attached to it; safe sexual activity to stop the spread of STIs and pregnancies is very much a good thing. And if there's a market for it, your friend is just following the money, which is a good thing to do in business. So I don't think either of you are wrong.\n\nObjectively they're not shameful though, and it might be a positive move to remind yourself that these items are perfectly normal and part of a perfectly normal aspect of life, even if they're not things you personally want to be associated with.", "Providing a discreet and reliable source of these things is not shameful. It\u2019s good business sense to sell what customers are asking for.", "Info: What exactly is wrong with those items?", "[deleted]", "NAH. Condoms aren't shameful. They prevent diseases and expensive unwanted babies, that's a *good* thing. She should sell *more* of them to university kids. Kids around the world could use a late night condom delivery person, to be honest. It's enterprising.\n\nYou are well within your rights to stop working for her at any time, and you can ask for your money back for whatever reason you want. \n\nHowever, do you really want to destroy a friendship over her choice to expand her business by adding safe protection? Think about it, really. Go ahead and make a clean break so that you can be married off, but maybe request a payment plan so that your girl can continue her work.", "NTA, while your morals sound more than a little conservative, especially for a Reddit audience, you are allowed to hold whatever moral beliefs you want. I also assume you are from a country where values are conservative and probably strongly tied to relgion.\n\nIf you don't have any prior contract or agreement with this friend, you can withdraw the money for whatever reason you want. If you do not like the products sold or how your name is tied to the reputation of the business, you have the right to pull out.", "INFO: where are you from", "INFO: do you legally have a say in what she does with her business? And can you legally take your money back once you've already given it?", "This is a wild ride.\nI'm guessing you're in India or at least the eastern psrt of the world?

The lack of them won't stop people having s*x, just forvce them to take risks for nothing.\nAlso, labelling them shameful? That says more about you than anything else. \nAnd further, if there's a demand for these things and selling them would improve her businesses wouldn't your support for a successful business reflect POSITIVELY on you? \nOr are you more interested in forcing your own morals onto others than you are in supporting a friend? Because ultimately, this is what it will boil down to. Nothing and noone is forcing you to use these things or impede on your own morals. \n\nFrankly, your prude personal views are severly outdated and your willingness to risk your friends' business and education over this is kind of unsettling. You are ofcourse in your full right to remove the funds, but YWBTA.\n\nETA - further comments regarding friends education as I missed that. \n\nETA2 - if your friend is considering selling these items and you've labelled thwm shameful to her, then in all likelyhood you've already labelled her shameful as well.

It seems like you are in a very, very conservative part of the world, to the point where a 26 year old woman is ashamed of even naming things that have to do with the taboo of human sexuality. Your friend has the right idea, because humans will have sex and they will explore their bodies, no matter how much shame there is, she is only giving them the option to not catch any diseases and avoid injuries. Your main concern is not your friend selling condoms, lube, plan b and sex toys, but your parents' punishment and shame, which quite honestly makes me feel so sad for you.

Also, this might just be grammar, but you said you gave her the money rather than loaned her the money. Is there a repayment plan? You have no ownership of the business, so you have a say in how ahe runs it? Could you discuss terms to slowly reduce your investment and say she is free to sell what she wants when she has paid you back?", "NTA, but Reddit was the wrong place to ask.

It\u2019s hard to say you\u2019re genuinely the AH here because it sounds like you hold the belief that these are \u201cshameful\u201d items due to your upbringing, religion and cultural opinions. The thing is, everywhere is different. It\u2019s part of your culture to have arranged marriage, whereas to a lot of places the idea of marrying someone your parents picks out is just madness. You then bring shame upon your family if you don\u2019t make it work, irrespective of how that person treats you. Do you see my point? \n\nUltimately everyone needs to be more accepting of what is normal in different cultures.

She's not an investor. Apparently it was a good will loan. If it was a loan she should start getting the money back because it seems like the cash reserves are growing. Asking for half of it back maybe bad for the business but 20% payments and giving time to replenish won't be. If it was a gift then why would she? She can just let the friend know that the other work she did for the company she can't do until she figures out after marriage. The US masters is putting a slight wrinkle but then again if it's a loan showing that money would be a misrepresentation on the visa application because the friend does not have that money. Besides who is going to run the business? You try to quit a business in which a vc invested, you'll very quickly find out that the vc owns the business.

You say you didn't expect anything from her after giving her money and that you have no ownership stake.  So, it is unclear that you have any right to the money back.  Essentially, you say you gave her money as a favor.  You'd then be asking a favor to get the money back.  That seems reasonable.\n\nAs to the root of the problem, I am not from your culture, but it seems pretty easy for me.  You did a friend a favor, gave her money and helped out getting the business started by managing for six months.  You don't sound like you are now involved other than as a friend bouncing ideas back and forth.  So, even if you are opposed to where she takes the business, you have nothing to do with it.  Everything was on the up and up (from your point of view) while you were directly involved.\n\nI don't see the problem there.  It seems if anyone says anything, it is simple enough to say \"I left a business to her in good shape, I'm not involved any more to set a direction\".  You could elaborate about how she felt she needed to sell certain items to get money to get into a masters program, or how you don't like the direction, or that you've requested your initial gift back.
