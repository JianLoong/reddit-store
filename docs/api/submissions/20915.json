Planning falls into the emotional labor category. He is being lazy. You should take a solo weekend getaway one weekend while he has his son. Why do you have to stick around just because he has to?", "NTA\n\nHe dumped the planning on you.  As you said, he just looked at the website for a place that was essentially fully booked. No cigar for him.", "NTA.  This was his plan all along.  He mentions HE FOUND a campsite, sends you the website link and that's all of his contribution.  I hate always having to be the one to organize trips/outings/etc.  Let him plan only for himself because he will never be going anywhere because it sounds like he can't plan.", "You are absolutely NTA. Your husband is pushing this job onto you and getting pissy when you called him on this tactic", "NTA", "Honestly, your post sounds like you really resent having his kid \"every single\" weekend and he was only looking for something because he thought you'd want it.  You should talk it out.  I suspect he is perfectly happy to stay home too.  NAH", "I disagree, he finds a place to go, this entire campground is near the beach, the first conversation you ask for the website, at this point his hands are completely tied until you\u2019ve signed off on it, you look and find one site that is actually on the beach and complain that it\u2019s too expensive, the other sites probably are exactly as he explained before, so yes, look around loving bride and find something you can agree too, I would wager something similar happens with all his suggestions, of course he doesn\u2019t plan because you\u2019re being the anchor, alternatively, you could reply sweet, what should I bring", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I was a stepchild and I believe that parents needs to spend one on one time with the kids. I oftenale plans with friends to ensure that does happen. That being said, I would like for some point this summer to have a small vacation alone with my husband. I just don't want to have to plan every single thing.", "Can I ask what part of my post suggest that I am not happy with the kid being here on weekends during the school year? I mentioned the custody part because I want people to be aware the opportunities to get away for a weekend has a limited time frame.", "Ohh. I see. It seems like you care more about that than he does. He seems perfectly content to not have a weekend trip with you (demonstrating this by his lazy \u201ceffort\u201d). If you really want this to happen, despite him not wanting as much, you\u2019ll have to plan it.", "Of course.  The word \"single\" in saying that you have the child every weekend.   Also, the use of the word \"kid\" and not humanizing the child with any descriptors, like age and gender. Also, the desire to have a weekend getaway specifically because you don't have the child.  You just strike me as being as celebratory about your \"summer break\" as teachers are.", "I didn't put the child age or gender in the post because I didn't think is was important to the context of the story nor do I feel I have to give that information to internet strangers. Only the custody schedule is important. During the school year, the child is with us every weekend. During the summer, the child is with us 5 days a week in order to have 50/50. Since I work from home, I am the primary caregiver during the summer schedule.  Stepparents already had presumed assumptions of being evil, thanks to fairytales and I don't think it is fair to judge my relationship with a kid that I have been a part of their life for many years based off a paragraph. \n\nAlso I never put a gender to myself or provided ages to either adult so it seems I am not humanizing myself or my spouse. Maybe the one humanizing factor I did put in there is that once in a while I want to spend a weekend reconnecting with my spouse.  That is perfectly normal even for nuclear families.", "Yeah these comments are looking for drama", "Whatever, no need to convince me. You asked a question and I answered.  It IS telling, though, that your \"husband\" from the post is now your \"spouse\" and the \"kid\" is now a \"child\" in your rebuttal to the things that I found linguistically telling about the original post.", "Everything OP said was perfectly fine. You are trying to find something that isn't there, and failing spectacularly.", "Nta. But if he goes on Ol\u00e1n I g for himself only divorce him. Do t waste time with nonsense. Be proactive!", "But the husband didn\u2019t even go as far as looking up the dates to see what is actually available from that website Make sure it was in the budget that he had set. Yes she needs to sign up at the very end she can\u2019t sign off on something that was never available to them  in the first place. In order for it to count as him planning something he needs to find a place within their price range that is actually available for her to sign off on. She would only be in the wrong if he did all those things and she still said no but that is not the case here", "Seems unlikely, there would be some kind of price listing or range on a site like that, the one on the beach being by far the most expensive, she made no mention of sites farther back, or any indication that she was going to accept it, personally I think the discrepancy lies in what \u201cby the beach\u201d means", "When you want to spend a weekend away together does it really matter who books it? Just book it FFS you really care about that 5 mins of \u201cemotional labour\u201d how taxing it must be living your life tallying up every time one of you screws  in a lightbulb whilst the other sat down.", "NTA\n\nthia sounds like not the real issue, \"i want you to put more effort into our relationship and spending quality time with me\"", "If you are booking a romantic weekend away and all you can think about is the \u201cemotional labour\u201d you are going through then just break up.", "Despite putting the term emotional labor in quotes, as if it doesn\u2019t exist (and it doesn\u2019t for some, because those are the people who rely on someone else to do the emotional labor), you make a valid point.\n\nOP wants to be romanced by her husband and he is clearly too selfish. Constructive abandonment is a legal term used to describe a spouse who emotionally checks out of a marriage but is physically still there. It\u2019s legally grounds for divorce."]}
