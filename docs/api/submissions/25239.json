We booked in January and had everything planned out, between the three couples we would split everything 3 ways. Last minute my girlfriends sisters boyfriend decided that he would essentially force my girlfriends younger brother into joining our trip literally the week before we go, after everyone had paid. My girlfriend called me and told me the news and naturally I asked \u201cwell is he going to pay his fair share?\u201d To which she replied no. Now her younger brother is an adult and works a part time job, the cottage if split between 7 of us is only $214 plus food etc. my sister and I both agreed that my gf\u2019s brother needs to pay to come on our trip as it\u2019s only fair. However my gf\u2019s sisters bf says that my gf\u2019s little brother shouldn\u2019t have to pay since \u201ceverything is already paid for\u201d and \u201che\u2019ll contribute in other ways\u201d even though he\u2019s said himself he doesn\u2019t really care if he comes or not but he\u2019s only going to contribute $75.  Now it\u2019s caused a huge fight between me, my sister and her bf and my gf\u2019s sisters boyfriend as he\u2019s stated if we try to charge my gf\u2019s brother or refuse to let him go then he will cancel and we\u2019ll have to refund their share (which I wouldn\u2019t be doing anyways since he already paid and he\u2019d be cancelling due to us not agreeing with his last minute change that he did without asking the group.) needless to say I\u2019m feeling extremely frustrated, I just wanted to have a nice vacation and now I have to deal with my gf\u2019s sisters volatile boyfriend making threats and getting pissed off with us when all we want is for everyone to pay their fair share. \n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1692670988, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15xs3bi/aita_for_making_my_gfs_brother_pay_to_come_on_our/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
