You WBTA if you were angry with her for leaving, but fully cutting contact, failing to leave the key, and refusing a refund make her TA. \n\nI\u2019m not even a dog person, but these are living creatures, and this akin to leaving a babysitting job without telling anyone, locking the kids in the house, and failing to notify their parents. \n\nWhen you take on any sort of sitting duty, it\u2019s with the understanding that even if the worst emergency arises, you must still fulfill your responsibility regarding basic safety and care of your charge until someone relieves you of your duties.", "NTA. If these were her OWN pets and grandpa passed, she would have to make arrangements for them. She dropped the ball big time, and she told you she doesn't care.", "She didn't notify you in the first place, you had to ask her ***after*** your dogs already weren't being taken care of. And then she didn't leave the key, said hurtful things to you, and then refuses to give your money back for the job she didn't do? Yeah, NTA.", "NTA \ni would say nita, but it\u2019s the fact that she didn\u2019t come back, put the key back, or message you. those dogs were her responsibility. she shouldn\u2019t have abandoned her responsibilities just because there was a death in the family. very rude of her to leave them stranded like that especially when she got paid in full", "NTA. I would be livid if someone did this with my dogs. Things happen, I get it, and it's sad she lost a family member - but she should have let you know so you could make other arrangements or come home early.", "NTA. I developed a severe infection from a surgery I had months ago during my last dogsit.  I needed to drive 4 hours away to get it handled and the surgeon was pressuring me to get it done asap to prevent the spread. \n\nI contacted the owner, explained my situation and asked if I could contact the backup they provided (I always ask for one in emergencies). His son said he could help and I could drop the dog off early in the am before going to the hospital. This was on the last day I was to watch her (the owners were coming home that night). I discounted them 2 days for the inconvenience. The owners were very understanding to my situation and were happy to help find an alternative so I didn\u2019t have to risk waiting. \n\nIf no one could have helped me I would have just had to wait it out WITH THE DOG and hope for the best. THIS IS HOW TO HANDLE THESE SITUATIONS. It\u2019s basic respect, and I assume if you are a normal person and she had explained her situation you could have helped problem solve. \n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nEmergencies happen, but she needed to contact you and make arrangements. It was not okay to just leave your dogs and not arrange for someone to help them, or bare minimum LEAVE THE KEY so you could do so. As someone else said, if she had her own pets, she would have needed to arrange for care for them, and she took on the duty of being responsible for yours, so that's what she needed to do here.", "NTA. If she couldn't handle the responsibility.. she shouldn't have offered to help out. When you're in charge of someone's house/animals, especially when *you're being paid*, you have to prioritize that being taken care of. She basically stole your money and house key, and left you and ur dogs out to dry. \n\nI get it, family emergencies are hard and stressful, but she made a commitment to you and ur animals. PLUS U PAID HER. Idk this post pisses me off; you're not the ashole. As someone who watches homes and animals often, I could never imagine pulling this type of crap. \nI get it if she had to go and couldn't return to the house, but like call the homeowner you're working for and tell them, and be ready to call another friend/family member/coworker to give them the key and tell them what they need to know so the dogs don't die. Jesus.", "I'd consider taking her to small claims court. NTA", "NTA\n\nI understood she had an emergency. But she could\u2019ve at least been responsible enough to leave the key like she said she did. Also, she lacked communication.", "NTA because this was neglectful on her part. Yes, she had a family emergency and condolences on the loss of her grandfather but she abandoned her responsibilities as a dog sitter. She didn't leave the key and won't refund the money. What she did could be considered a criminal act in many jurisdictions because if your dogs had any sort of incident while she was away she could be charged.", "NTA. My MOM died, and I still took care of animals and siblings, and went to work. I get that everyone grieves differently, but there is no way that she couldn't stop by the house every now and again to let the dogs out, or ask someone in her family or friend circle to help with the responsibility. \n\nI feel bad that her grandpa passed, but I'd go through heaven and hell for my animals, and I'd be telling that friend to stay far away from me and my animals after the way she handled the situation. I'd also change your locks first thing when you get home. Who knows where that key went?", "NTA. I hope you take her to court.", "Let's face it, most friends are assholes.", "Nta, she had a job. Those with a job must still make arrangements to deal with a family death. I did it with both of my parents, worked until arrangements could be made, took my allotted bereavement and then finished the grieving process while earning my living.

I understand her wanting to go, but she should have communicated with you, allowed you time to make arrangements and returned the pay for the job she did not completem", "ESH.\n\n(1) She should have made sure to leave that key. (2) she should have better communicated about her family emergency from the start. \n\nAnd you honestly are being very insensitive to the fact that she just lost a family member.
