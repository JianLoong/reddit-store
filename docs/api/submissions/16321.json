I am genuinely curious as I do not know. Regardless, you were being helpful and did nothing wrong.", "Sounds like your coworkers is trying too hard to be woke/politically correct or whatever the current media trend is...", "Muslim here.\n\nOn behalf of the entire Muslim community, I would like to thank you for your thoughtfulness and consideration. I am sure your students consider themselves lucky to have you as their teacher. \n\nI wish you all the best, and may peace be with you.", "Muslim here. You are NTA.", "Honestly it sounds like your coworker is covering up their own bigotry and ignorance under the guise of \u201cwokeness\u201d - there\u2019s absolutely no empathy in any of the things they\u2019ve said.", "You\u2019ve got all you need here - just say you took what they said yesterday in good faith and asked some actual Muslims (seems to be plenty in this thread) who explained that it was entirely appropriate and not even close to appropriation.", "Unless you pulled out a prayer mat and started praying along with them, you weren't doing anything that could possibly be deemed cultural appropriation.\n\nI wonder if your coworker knows that white people can convert to Islam?", "Your co-worker is an idiot. \n\nYou are being thoughtful.\n\nKeep calm and carry on.", "Yeah, no, she accused you of wearing \u201ccompass face\u201d.

Thank you so much for it.", "What type of hotels? Any international/American brands?", "Agreed. To me it is a sign of respect as well. \u201cI respect you and your religion enough to help you do it the best way possible\u201d.", "I've never been to the USA but I've seen this fairly often in Asian hotels. It's usually a sticker in the bedside drawer.", "Welp I'm not American, but places I've stayed have included a Hilton and a Crowne Plaza, amongst others. All I'm saying is in a huge part of the world this is a totally normal thing, and therefore mundane. OP has done absolutely nothing wrong.", "Yup, can confirm"]}
