I don\u2019t think your coworker knows the definition of cultural appropriation.", "NTA. Actually you're being culturally sensitive.", "NTA. That's not what cultural appropriation is. Every Muslim prays in the direction of Mecca, and they need to know what direction to sit in order to pray. Simply placing a post-it pointing in the direction is being helpful, not disrespectful. Ask the Muslims in the group how they feel about what you were intending to do. They'd probably say that's a good idea.", "NTA\n\nIn fact, you are incredibly kind to offer them a safe space to pray and to ensure they were in the right direction of Mecca.

Unless the 'lil post' was a religious depiction you probably weren't at risk of offending them.

Your coworker is being performative at best and in the worst way because he's trying to get you to not do something that is legitimately helpful for your students and was done in a really respectful and unobtrusive way.
