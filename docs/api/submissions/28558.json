For example, you watch your nephew from 5am-9:30, your wife watches him from 9:30-2? That way you get a break and your wife gets to sleep in.", "NTA - Like you said, you're not refusing to babysit. You just don't enjoy it. Your wife is likely defensive because of the close relation.", "NTA, but you need to make some effort here to improve the situation and make it less draining. 2 year olds do need constant supervision. If you have stuff you don't want him getting into, make it inaccessible when he's there. You also don't need to wait until 10-11am to take him to a park. You and your wife could split the task of playing with him rather than both doing it the whole time. Do you have toys or things for him to do while you're there?", "NTA - seems weird for you to be called an asshole for this though.\n\nIs there anything missing from the story? \n\nYou\u2019re allowed to not enjoy looking after a 2 year old. Every parent has days they don\u2019t enjoy looking after a 2 year old and that\u2019s their own kid.\n\nI took my 3 kids to see my parents yesterday, I was there about four hours. Left about midday. They slept most of the afternoon after it. Looking after kids is hard!", "NTA but can you suggest that your wife baby sit at her sister\u2019s house so the child has all his toys etc.  your home is not toddler proof and was there any discussion of repairs?  There should be some rules and guidelines. A 2 year old shouldn\u2019t require 2 adults to watch. \n\nThe sister wants the free trusted help, even paid help it\u2019s hard to find someone for 5am -2pm on the weekends.  \n\nNot your baby, not your problem\u2026 yet it is.   You and your wife need communication, conflict resolution snd setting enforcing boundaries.  Your wife and you should act as a team.  Speak to her tell her you understand family is important but these serious issues like not getting good rest on your days off is not good.  It\u2019s putting strain on you.  Come up with solutions together and both of you need to learn to say \u201cNo.\u201d yes both of you.", "NTA. But is it an option to look after him at his own house?", "NTA\n\nOpie you are justified to be less than thrilled to watch a kid that is not even yours. Your wife has to understand that you are not a free babysitter who one that gets paid to enjoy watching over kids.\n\n>Work has really been difficult this year and my days off mean more to me now than they ever have. When we end up babysitting on the weekends, it feels almost like a complete wash since I hardly did any relaxing and the next week at work sucks again.\n\nYou are not the a-hole and your wife has to realize that although they are family it doesn't mean that they are entitled to your joy or free time. I think you should sit down with your wife and tell her the ground rules and mention that although the child is nice and good lad there has to be some boundaries to place. \n\nHonestly I want to ask Opie, does your sister-in-law pay you to babysit or does she reimburse for damages and all that?", "NTA.\n\nCan your wife go to her sister's place and mind the kid there?", "NTA. I don't understand why she's unhappy as you're doing what's needed although you aren't enjoying it. You might want to communicate clearly and constructively because you didn't seem to do a whole lot wrong to me.\n\nThe real trick here is to actually have a bit of fun with it though. Figure out more activities to do with him - they love being involved in stuff. Get him a construction hat and get him to build stuff. Or get him to do some play wiring if you like electronics. Toddler proof the house so he's not running into things he can break. If you like big breakfasts, get him a big breakfast as well (even if it's not real). Make him part of your day.\n\nAs others have said, make sure you tag team and take it in turns with your wife so you both get time off here and there to do your own stuff. Split the time in such a way that the time works for you to unwind.", "NTA. But a piece of advice if you're ever planning to have kids - help out your family, because you'll need them a thousand times over when the time comes for you.", "Nta but your wife is not respecting you at all. It\u2019s unfair if her to assume it\u2019s okay to babysit so often.", "NTA", "NTA. As a couple others said, my first thought was if you usually know it the night before, have your wife go sleep at her sisters house.  Then, they can hang out that night and chat, as you said they\u2019re very close, and then sister leaves in the morning for work and kid can sleep in longer at home.   Then the kid is at home with his stuff etc.  sometimes you come over to help later, etc", "Not \"being thrilled\" and holding a grudge is not the same. You didn't write anything about you making suggestions to make the situation more bearable in order for you to be content and relaxed while looking after the kid. Try that first. See how your wife reacts to it and hear her out. NTA but on the way if you don't solve the issue before it gets out of hand and becomes a problem between you and your wife.", "NTA also, daycare and kindergarden is a thing.", "You are a good guy helping her. 2 years old are handful and full of energy. I agree with you on getting old and not enjoying baby sitting. But for fun look at as training for time when you have a two year old. It will be like this 24/7", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She gets the. 5 am shift while you sleep a few more hours, then at 9, you take him to the park while she naps? Those hours are horrible for babysitting! I think your wife is being unreasonable. You do it. For her to want you to be joyous about it is too big an ask!  I get it about feeling like crap the rest of the weekend. Chat with your wife about encouraging her sister to find another back up sitter.

Plus, it allows the kid to get some sleep and wake up at a more regular time, so they can go over there, let the kid get up around 7ish or so, which will likely make dealing with him easier. I imagine a two-year-old that's been woken up super early to get dressed and dropped off at his aunt's house is probably extra cranky and hyper.", "If you don't think he's TA, you should use the acronym NTA instead because the bot that counts the NTA/YTA votes only looks at the first acronym in the reply instead of the context(the \"I don't think\" before it)", "That is good advice, thank you.", "Duly noted."]}
