Figure out more activities to do with him - they love being involved in stuff. Get him a construction hat and get him to build stuff. Or get him to do some play wiring if you like electronics. Toddler proof the house so he's not running into things he can break. If you like big breakfasts, get him a big breakfast as well (even if it's not real).
