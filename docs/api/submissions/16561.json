If I'd started a new job and didn't want to take time off too early, I definitely wouldn't be taking a day off for my dad's birthday and mother's day. Which I could easily celebrate after work. Or on whatever day I'm next off work.", "If she won't enjoy being there alone, why go at all?", "I might agree if OP were taking off half-a-week for his own thing - AND that thing were somewhat frivolous or expensive (in the same $500+ range), but there\u2019s clearly a difference between asking one day off a new job and asking off for 3-4 days.\n\nThere\u2019s also a difference between making time for your parents, and making time (or spending a bunch of money) for people you don\u2019t know.\n\nIt\u2019s not like the gf asked OP to take off for her birthday and he declined, but then took off for his dad\u2019s birthday. It\u2019s not an apples-to-apples comparison, and I think it\u2019s a mistake to regard this as a sign that OP isn\u2019t committed.", "I dunno, I feel like it\u2019s relevant to his workload - one day he could make up pretty quick (or work ahead), but 3.5 days could put him behind or mean other people have to pick up the slack.\n\nIt also feels a bit cheekier to ask off for multiple days when you\u2019re just starting at a job - that\u2019s how I\u2019d feel anyway", "There's a difference between taking one day off and taking the 5 or so needed for this wedding.", "Just commenting to say mother's day and a father's bday are more important than a stranger's wedding, gf or no gf. Unless you're estranged from your family and/or don't care much for them.", "Yep try having a birthday on a Bank holiday and you soon realise that birthday celebrations are flexible", "Exactly. 1 day for Mother's Day AND your father's birthday... Or half a week for a stranger's wedding. Pretty mind boggling to me how some people are acting like the two situations are the same and that OP somehow \"lied\" or miscommunicated about not being able to take time off. It's completely true that a lot of jobs would view those two scenarios VERY VERY differently. Especially when you *just* started", "YTA. You don't leave your girlfriend of 6 years go to a wedding on her own  if she wants you there. Any new job I started I was asked when hired if I had upcoming holidays booked and they were always accommodated.", "YTA you lied to her about why you wouldn\u2019t take work off and just expect her to be okay with it. Can\u2019t believe the people saying N T A when this whole thing could\u2019ve been avoided by just being fucking honest from the start about not wanting to spend money on it.", "INFO how long have you & gf been together? How long have you known about this wedding?", "INFO: where do you see the relationship with your girlfriend going?", "NTA overall but AH move to not talk to her about taking the same time off", "Hell not NTA. My husband\u2019s incredibly snotty cousin decided on a destination wedding during the height of COVID. No one went. Her mom literally asked us all why we weren\u2019t there, like first of all, Miss Mam, the last time I saw your daughter she straight up ignored me to hug a friend from college and barely acknowledges us regardless of what\u2019s going on and THEN her fianc\u00e9 was super shwasted and tried to fondle me. I had to want him to stop trying to grope me or I was going to throat punch him. Thanks but I\u2019ll pass.", "NTA\n\nSomething tells me your girlfriend wanted arm candy. That's not a realistic expectation from her. Not for people you don't actually know.", "NTA", "NTA. You didn't take the time off *for yourself.* You took *one*, not half a week, to spend time with your family.", "NTA. Your girlfriend needs to cop on.\n\nA day for your mum and dad =/= half a week and a shit ton of money for someone you don't know.", "He literally lied to her about why he couldn\u2019t go and now is surprised she\u2019s mad at him for doing exactly what he said he couldn\u2019t do. You\u2019re crazy if you think he\u2019s in the right. He should be just been honest and not lied to her from the beginning.", "Not the same week, I think. The wedding was a few weeks ago, the time off was now-ish.", "This post suspiciously sounds like another post about a gf complaining her bf wouldn't go with her, but it was a for a bachelor party", "I\u2019m sorry - where is the lie?", "He said he couldn\u2019t take the time off work because he just started, when the reality is he didn\u2019t want to spend that much money on a wedding for someone he doesn\u2019t really know. \n\nIf he would\u2019ve been honest from the beginning then he wouldn\u2019t be in this situation.", "It is relevant because one is only a small imposition that\u2019s not as likely to be disruptive (and doesn\u2019t really look bad to ask) and the other is a bigger imposition that\u2019s more likely to be disruptive (snd does look bad to ask).\n\nI think everyone replying and voting who doesn\u2019t get this must be in an age demographic that doesnt have much (or any) exposure to workplace norms..", "No. Those are not movable holidays.", "You did not take a day off for yourself. You took a day off for your dad's birthday and Mothers' Day.\n\nAttending the wedding would have incurred considerable expense for people you don't know. These are not equivalent events and cannot be compared the same way. NTA", "NTA.", "NTA. Your gf is selfish, irrational & making you question your solid decision-making skills. It\u2019s time to move on to a more suitable & mature partner.", "NTA. The two events are not anyway similar. As many have said here, the wedding is only an \"invitation, not a summons.\" You can't afford to take so much time from a BRAND NEW job. Employers don't look kindly on that. \n\nGo celebrate with your Mom and Dad.", "What? This is a stranger vs his family. NTA. If the gf doesn't understand the difference, then she is the problem.", "This comment needs to win.", "The time of requests aren't remotely equivalent here, though.  That should be obvious. It is very possible to not be able to take several days off but able to take one.", "You are the sweetest asshole", "If you're barely in the door of a new job there is a world of a difference between asking for a single day off vs asking for half the week off. Actually, the same applies if you've been in a job for years.\n\nWithout knowing what OP does, a day off would usually mean you're just not there that day to do the work. No big deal. A few days off possibly means someone will have to take on some of your duties while you're gone.\n\nAlso the difference isn't just asking for half a week off vs asking for a day off.\n\nThe difference is asking for half a week off so you can spend $500 to travel a very long distance to celebrate people you've never met vs. asking for a day off to celebrate special occasions for both your parents whom you presumably don't have to spend $500 to fly 7 hours to see.", "It's the same week.\n\n>Anyways, last week I put in a notice for a day off to celebrate Mothers Day and my Dads birthday... I had completely forgot about the wedding which, to my dismay, is being hosted the same week.\n\nThat said the commenter has made the assumption OP didn't tell his girlfirend the reasons why he didn't want to take time off from the wedding. While it's not 100% clear in the post, it does seem he did tell her all the reasons he told us.\n\n>Overall, I thought the timing, location, and my relationship to the couple was enough to justify me not going but my girlfriend was pissed", "He also kind of lied. He said he couldn\u2019t/wouldn\u2019t take the time off and then did.\n\nI doubt there would be many YTA if he had told her from the beginning he didn\u2019t want to take the time off or spend the money for the wedding. Instead he made it seem like a logistic issue.", "Not being able to take several days off is the same as not being able to take one day off?", "My girlfriend of 3 years best friend lives far from us, I\u2019ll be meeting her in person for the first time in a couple of months. You know what I don\u2019t consider her as? Someone I\u2019ve never met before. If the pandemic didn\u2019t teach you how to still hang out with and have a good time with your friends without being there in person then it must have been a very shitty time. The fact that OP still considers this friend someone that they\u2019ve never met after 6 years is very telling on how close they actually are tbh.", "What\u2019s your reason for trying to blame OP? I think I know your reason already. My girlfriend is in a similar situation with her best friend living some distance away from us. She made the effort to involve me in what\u2019s going on in her friends life and we\u2019ve organised online hangouts to make up for the fact there\u2019s a distance. I\u2019ll be meeting her for the first time in a couple months, but you know what I don\u2019t consider her as? Someone that I\u2019ve never met before, despite never meeting in person yet. Very telling that after 6 years, OP feels that this is a total stranger. To me, that screams they\u2019re not that close.", "I agree it\u2019s not the same we have zero quarrels there. That however doesn\u2019t change the fact that he lied about why he couldn\u2019t go and it\u2019s now catching up with him. He didn\u2019t need to lie about the reason"]}
