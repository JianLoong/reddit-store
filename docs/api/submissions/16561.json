We\u2019re dating, not glued together and will die without each other. And if it\u2019s her friends, I\u2019d assume she\u2019d know other people there so it\u2019s not like she\u2019d be completely alone either.", "Your girlfriend is asking for too much for people you don't know as opposed to FAMILY, a special occasion AND having to spend no money at all.", "Honestly all the y t a people sound like they\u2019ve never had a job. NTA.", "But why don't you agree? I could see that him going to the wedding versus the hypothetical trip to see his family would could seem like prioritizing his family over his gf. But I think most people would say it's okay to prioritize family over being a kind of third wheel at a wedding where the only person you know is your gf. And it can be healthy to have breaks from SO, there is no need to go to the same places and be attached at the hip for your entire relationship.", "It definitely is projection.  I love my husband.. but he is a workaholic (as am I) and sometimes gets stingy with his vacation time.  It was something that we had to work through and figure out\u2026 sort of like agreeing on finances and how to raise children.", "> and the wedding was only a couple hours away driving (3 hours)\n\nno he said driving to see his family was a 3 hour drive the wedding is about 7 as he said in the post", "This reads like you're feeling dismayed.", "Yeah, she was relieved.  The reason was \"yes, I am related to them, but I don't know them.  There's some I've met like twice in my life and since our grandparents passed we don't have a good central place to get together. \" For context I'm not sure I could name them all off the top of my head.  I could do it if we had a big family picture but I don't think one exists.", "i would say all of those listed verbs equate to forgetting", "He said it was only 3 hours away to the wedding in a comment", "NTA. ONE DAY to spend with your family for two special event celebration is a world of difference from $500 or multiple days off to go to a wedding for people you don\u2019t know.", "Yes, but \"forget\" was not said as the original commenter asked. Sooo...", "the comment was in response to someone asking if he had to fly to see his parents and he said its about 3 hours drive", "He was asked if he had to fly to see his family and he replied \u201cNo, it's a 3 hour drive\u201d", "What did you tell her was the reason you didn\u2019t want to come was?", "  NTA. ONE DAY to spend with your family for two special event celebration is a world of difference from $500 or multiple days off to go to a wedding for people you don\u2019t know."]}
