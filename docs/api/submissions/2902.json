That is HER job. The fact that she was spending nights at her BF's house and leaving Max with you is also unacceptable.

She is responsibly for finding a living situation that works for them.", "NTA. Amy is unconsciously training Max to behave this way. She\u2019s obviously clueless and considers you and the family as bit-part actors in her human-canine soap opera.

Max\u2019s poop is *her* responsibility (but your problem) and she must, without fail, deal with it and housetrain him. This is *your* home and it is unsafe and unsanitary for your children.
