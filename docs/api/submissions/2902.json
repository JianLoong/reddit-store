That is HER job. The fact that she was spending nights at her BF's house and leaving Max with you is also unacceptable.

She is responsibly for finding a living situation that works for them.", "NTA. Amy is unconsciously training Max to behave this way. She\u2019s obviously clueless and considers you and the family as bit-part actors in her human-canine soap opera.

Max\u2019s poop is *her* responsibility (but your problem) and she must, without fail, deal with it and housetrain him. This is *your* home and it is unsafe and unsanitary for your children.

WHAT?", "*The last straw is Max\u2019s newest behavior of barreling into people so that they fall down, drop their plates, and then Max can eat the food. Amy saw this firsthand and watched Zoe get hurt because of Max.*\n\nOp, this is horrendous. Someday, someone will try to save their food from Max's greedy jaws, and he will react like a dog who has not been taught the boundary between their food and humans' food, and it will end in a serious injury and a dog being put down. I'm just glad for you, it didn't happen in your home to your children, though it seems it was just about to.\n\nNTA but your daughter seriously is.

You're in he right to make those rules", "NTA", "NTA\n\nIt is NOT YOUR responsibility to train Amy's dog.  Amy did nothing about her own dog.

I love dogs in general more than most people, and I love my own dog more than all but a very select few people. \n\nBut a dog is a responsibility. When I was very small, and tried to talk my parents into my getting one, my mother said to me \u201cYou can get a dog, but it will be *completely* your responsibility: we will pay for the vet, the food, and the toys, but you have to train it - which includes house training - walk it twice a day rain, snow, or shine, play with it, and teach it how to be a good member of the family\u201d. Even at 8 years old, I understood that, and didn\u2019t think I was responsible enough to do that until I was well into adulthood. \nAnd I like to think I\u2019ve done pretty well: my dog was fully house trained by 5 or 6 months (I got him at 13 weeks), once he got over his puppy exuberance he stopped jumping, he knows he has to sit to get any kind of treats, and he\u2019s sweet and loving to pretty much everyone (even though he\u2019s of a breed that has a reputation for being aggressive and protective). \n\nAmy has done absolutely none of that. Like any host, all you\u2019re asking is for Max to be a good houseguest: don\u2019t pee or poop in common areas of the house, knock people over, or make a lot of noise late at night. \nIf Max were a human, you wouldn\u2019t let him stay, Max being an untrained dog should be treated similarly.", "NTA\n\nWhy would you be expected to train your adult daughter\u2019s dog??

He needs to be in a better situation.", "NTA", "NTA", "I wasn't aware that being a great houseguest meant that you were responsible (directly or indirectly) for piss and poo being distributed throughout the host's home. I have been doing it all wrong!", "OP says Amy sleeps at her boyfriends most nites, so how is she a good houseguest? She should take Max with her.  Also, he\u2019s 5 and should already be trained not to do these things.  Seems like Amy is TA here.", "THIS RIGHT HERE.

So NTA.", "you\u2019re either training your dog, or your dog trains you", "You're very lucky your interaction turned out this way. In my experience physical displays of dominance with an anxious or fearful dog generally never turn out well. I can't say what motivated your dogs behavior. Raised hackles can actually mean several different things. Excitement, fear, insecurity as well as dominant behavior. True dominant behavior in dogs over a human in my understanding is actually pretty rare. I'm very glad that you formed a good relationship with your dog and got to enjoy his company for that long. I lost my rescued American bulldog girl in 2020 and still can't drive past the vet's office without crying.", "You're acting like the dog is OP's responsibility. He's not, he's Amy's responsibility and Amy's alone. Amy refuses to take responsibility, and the proper response on OP's part is not to do Amy's job for her but to send her somewhere she can be irresponsible without affecting OP or her minor children.", "These would be great points if Max was actually OP\u2019s dog or problem. But since he isn\u2019t, they\u2019re pointless"]}
