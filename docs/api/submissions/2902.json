That is HER job. The fact that she was spending nights at her BF's house and leaving Max with you is also unacceptable.

She is responsibly for finding a living situation that works for them.", "NTA. Amy is unconsciously training Max to behave this way. She\u2019s obviously clueless and considers you and the family as bit-part actors in her human-canine soap opera.

Max\u2019s poop is *her* responsibility (but your problem) and she must, without fail, deal with it and housetrain him. This is *your* home and it is unsafe and unsanitary for your children.

And I say this as a dog lover and a dog mom, your daughter is an adult and if she's not willing to take the responsibility and the job to educate a dog then she needs to be only around toy dogs. How is she going to handle vet visits, is he even vaccinated? Takes the necessary monthly precautions for parasites, fleas? Does she walk him? I LOVE my dog, she's my baby. I'm a grown ass woman and live at my parents by paying myself because they have the space and need my help some so we all benefit. My dog is my dog, I walk her daily, take her to the backyard so she can pee and poop there and TAUGHT her to do that only there. She's had a couple accidents, quite rarely now that she's 3 but I always clean and make sure it doesn't smell and make sure to take her out more so she can go potty enough and these accidents don't happen. I feed her, take her to the vet. Whenever she'd bark between 11pm and 7 am. I'd get up to correct her and stay with her until she was calm. A dog is not a toy and it looks like your daughter didn't move because it was closer and wanted to be closer to you. She was probably kicked out from her apartment because of Max. And is not Max's fault. Tell those family members and friends to take your adult daughter for a few weeks (not days, at least a week or two) with the same liberties and habits she has at your home, then let them tell you about their experiences. I'm sure her boyfriend is not going to be her boyfriend any longer unless he has the patience to educate Max.\nYour daughter needs to be treated like a child because she needs to be taught that having a pet is like having a baby, a fur baby that will pee and poo all over, that you need to educate and correct and you need to take care of their physical and emotional needs", "NTA Take the dog to the relatives who are criticizing you.", "NAH. \n\nYou\u2019re in every way right to feel how you feel about her poor training \n\nShe is in every right to want to keep the dog she raised. \n\nAs a compromise why not invest in some dog training classes with a positive reinforcement trainer for just Max and Amy to go to. It will solve the dogs behavior and you won\u2019t have to spend much time training it.

A few weeks of consistent effort with training, and then keeping it up, would probably eliminate these problems almost entirely, and that effort is part of taking care of a dog. The peeing/pooping in the house at five years old is a product of neglect or anxiety, both of which it seems like Max is experiencing. Tell her she needs to be more attentive and work on training with him, and if she doesn\u2019t put in the effort, she and Max need to move out. For the sake of the dog, please don\u2019t just re-home him, it causes so many issues and it\u2019s not fair to them if they\u2019re in a household that is perfectly capable of taking care of them. She shouldn\u2019t learn that it\u2019s acceptable to get an animal, create these issues, and then dump the dog because of problems that are entirely her own fault.", "NTA.  Amy is grown and has failed to train her puppy, now fully grown dog, properly all this time.  It is not your place to fix her mistake here.

Amy doesn't care about the dog at all. She hasn't even trained it to not mess in the house or not to knock people down. She shuts it away from her at night and then expects everyone else to deal with middle of the night howling and barking. She isn't around much; she's at her boyfriends -*without* her dog.

Amy bought a cute little plush toy which is now a grown dog and she no long wants to deal with it. Too bad. It's her dog and her 15+ year responsibility.

They might have an unstable liability risk, or they might have a dog that just about anyone could buddy up to because it's fucking desperate for companionship. They usually have a nuisance barker whose barks they ignore, so the \"alarm feature\" is busted.\n\nMy point? People should train their dogs and treat them well, regardless what jobs they might have in mind for them.\n\nEdit: for grammar", "Your comment made me laugh!", "My comment was specifically about the relationship between a human and their dog, not a generalization.", "Dog training is all about training us humans and not really the dog.

Lucky for Max it's not too late to be trained how to interact appropriately. \n\nBased on his age and breed I'm telling you that Max requires a lot more exercise than he's getting now. With the right amount of exercise he would likely stop peeing/pooping indoors and by running off his energy he'd be more inclined to sleep at night instead of waking the household. \n\nIf Amy's not going to put the work in then she needs to do what's best for Max.", "NTA. I'm usually against rehoming, but Amy is not a responsible pet owner but is responsible for teaching her dog bad habits that others shouldn't have to put up with. Maybe if she was home instead of at her boyfriend's, she could take the dog out regularly so he'd stop having accidents inside. When I adopted my current dog as a teenager, my dad's rule was I had to get up eearly very morning to take him outside and walk him several times a day until we were sure he was housebroken. If Amy wants to keep her dog so bad, maybe give her a chance to take care of him properly with strict rules and the understanding he has to leave if she doesn't follow them. Or tell her she needs to take training classes with him to break his bad behaviors since she's the cause. If they both shape up and he stops terrorizing your family, then he can stay.

You parented her by teaching her to take care of her own dog.", "so i was ready to have some sympathy for Amy assuming that she adopted him recently and these are behaviors he picked up from previous owners, until i read that she's had him since he was a puppy. i'm baffled that her loved ones are saying YOU should be training him to behave properly...she should've done that 5 years ago!! unless he has some urinary disease, a dog that age should not be peeing and pooping in the house that frequently. he should ALREADY be trained.\n\nat best, he's acting like this because he's stressed about the new environment and his owner isn't around to help him adjust since she's always at her boyfriend's, at worst, she never trained him adequately to begin with. i normally am against rehoming unless it's for an extreme reason, but no offense, your daughter sounds like a terrible owner. definitely NTA, especially because this is affecting your minor child's quality of life.", "NTA. It is Amy's job/responsibility to have trained Max long before this situation occurred. The aunt, GM, and her cronies can all take a long walk off a short pier.

Amy clearly isnt giving him the proper attention he needs to be a healthy and well behaved dog. She just wants a cute animal to play with when she wants and nothing else matters.
