That is HER job. The fact that she was spending nights at her BF's house and leaving Max with you is also unacceptable.

She is responsibly for finding a living situation that works for them.", "NTA. Amy is unconsciously training Max to behave this way. She\u2019s obviously clueless and considers you and the family as bit-part actors in her human-canine soap opera.

Max\u2019s poop is *her* responsibility (but your problem) and she must, without fail, deal with it and housetrain him. This is *your* home and it is unsafe and unsanitary for your children.

My 77 pound GSD and I often stay with my parents, have since my girl was a puppy. At the bare minimum, a guest dog should be housetrained, able to settle overnight, and not harass or endanger the people in the house.\n\nYour daughter is a lousy, lazy dog owner, and Max deserves better. She's acting in a profoundly selfish fashion (dumping the dog on you to go play house with her boyfriend, failing to meet Max's basic needs for potty acess, stimulation, and attention), and you need to make it clear that her pets (Max or any others she may get) are not welcome in your home.\n\nHold firm, unless the BF is a total sucker Amy's neglect of her dog is going to get them both tossed out soon.", "ESH\n\nYour daughter obviously sucks because of her lack of training and care of her dog\n\nYou suck because you suggested rehoming the dog. This behavior is not the dogs fault. He's having accidents inside, barking, etc because he's not getting the attention and mental stimulation he needs. Telling her to rehome the dog punishes the dog for her laziness. \n\nShe needs to leave with her dog and it sounds like she has an aunt, grandmother and friends who would be perfect volunteers to take her in.", "Yep    Tell them Amy and the dog are on their way!!", "Tell grandma the big fun when max will knock her down so he can eat her food.  Big laughs to be had by all!   New hip here we come!", "Seriously.", "This! OP, don't let outsiders make you feel bad if they won't do it themselves. If her aunt, and grandma think this is okay, let them know they are free to let her stay with them with the dog. If they can do what they are asking, you'll accept that they think you are an A-H, but otherwise they need to shut it", "Actually, I don't find a chained up dog an effective in any way.\n\nA trained dog is much better.", "Wish I could upvote more than once.", "Right? She doesn't care about her dog enough to actually spend time with him or meet his needs, they can't have that much of a bond.

I got the same issue, and strict military regiment couldn't fix my sleep cycle\n\nShe's prescribed a medication (Catapres) which helps her to fall asleep initially. It's very effective but it can't be taken more than once a night. So if she's woken up by something like the dog barking non-stop, then it's almost impossible for her to fall back asleep.\n\nMelatonin usually works for me and my son, but for Zoe it isn't strong enough by itself.", "How is OP an asshole?", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
