My wife took a new job in 2015 that was a position with more stress and not much pay increase, but provided a lot of potential for career growth. The job required her to consistently stay late, work nights, and work on weekends. I knew this was important to her, so stepped up with doing more housework, took over most of the childcare responsibilities. Over five years, this got increasingly worse. I took over pretty much all of the housework and kid responsibilities, which impacted both my health and my own job.\n\nWhen the pandemic happened, things go so much worse. We were both working from home, and the kids were at home, but she still didn't pull her weight. She would go into her home office at 9am and wouldn't come out until 5 or 6 pm. I had to juggle work and the home school work in addition to the other work I was doing. I found a new job with much better pay, literally covering 85% of our combined salaries, and she said she wanted to quit her job and find something that allowed her more time to spend with the kids and help around the house.\n\nAbout the same time I took the new job, she got a promotion, and decided not to leave. She promised to help out more around the house, but after a year I was still doing the same amount of work at home, she wasn't helping, and she justified this by saying the kids were older and back at school so there was just less work to do. This led to a series of big fights and me asking for a weekend to reconnect with friends and have a break. We agreed on a weekend, I organized my friends, and paid for the trip (mostly non-refundable stuff).\n\nTwo weeks before the trip, she gets invited to an on-site event for work that conflicted with my trip. She said it was technically optional, but felt it was important for her career so she already bought plane tickets on her company card. I told her that I was absolutely not cancelling my trip for an optional work event and if she wanted to go she should make arrangements for somebody to take care of the kids. She complained but I stood my ground. Over the two weeks, I asked several times if she arranged for somebody to take care of the kids and it just led to more fights. On the day I was leaving for my trip, I packed my suitcase and told her I was leaving for the airport. I told her I talked to my mom and the kids could stay their if she hadn't created plans, then I left.\n\nI got a bunch of angry texts for \"dropping this on her at the last minute\" and calling me \"a neglectful father\". I told her that my trip had been planned for months and was literally planned because she was being a workaholic.\n\nI don't feel like I'm the AH here because my trip was planned well in advance and I made backup plans with my mom to handle the kids (my daughter was old enough to drive to my mom's place 2 hours away).

Especially if their are kids. From your post, it sounds like she is neglectful. Not chipping in for house work, or even making sure her children are looked after isn't okay. You pulled her kicking and s reaming the whole way and all she had to do at that point was drop the kids off with your mother.", "NTA glad she\u2019s an ex\u2026she\u2019s literally still bringing this up?

If she felt that it was necessary to go on the trip, she should have taken the initiative to find child care.
