My wife took a new job in 2015 that was a position with more stress and not much pay increase, but provided a lot of potential for career growth. The job required her to consistently stay late, work nights, and work on weekends. I knew this was important to her, so stepped up with doing more housework, took over most of the childcare responsibilities. Over five years, this got increasingly worse. I took over pretty much all of the housework and kid responsibilities, which impacted both my health and my own job.\n\nWhen the pandemic happened, things go so much worse. We were both working from home, and the kids were at home, but she still didn't pull her weight. She would go into her home office at 9am and wouldn't come out until 5 or 6 pm. I had to juggle work and the home school work in addition to the other work I was doing. I found a new job with much better pay, literally covering 85% of our combined salaries, and she said she wanted to quit her job and find something that allowed her more time to spend with the kids and help around the house.\n\nAbout the same time I took the new job, she got a promotion, and decided not to leave. She promised to help out more around the house, but after a year I was still doing the same amount of work at home, she wasn't helping, and she justified this by saying the kids were older and back at school so there was just less work to do. This led to a series of big fights and me asking for a weekend to reconnect with friends and have a break. We agreed on a weekend, I organized my friends, and paid for the trip (mostly non-refundable stuff).\n\nTwo weeks before the trip, she gets invited to an on-site event for work that conflicted with my trip. She said it was technically optional, but felt it was important for her career so she already bought plane tickets on her company card. I told her that I was absolutely not cancelling my trip for an optional work event and if she wanted to go she should make arrangements for somebody to take care of the kids. She complained but I stood my ground. Over the two weeks, I asked several times if she arranged for somebody to take care of the kids and it just led to more fights. On the day I was leaving for my trip, I packed my suitcase and told her I was leaving for the airport. I told her I talked to my mom and the kids could stay their if she hadn't created plans, then I left.\n\nI got a bunch of angry texts for \"dropping this on her at the last minute\" and calling me \"a neglectful father\". I told her that my trip had been planned for months and was literally planned because she was being a workaholic.\n\nI don't feel like I'm the AH here because my trip was planned well in advance and I made backup plans with my mom to handle the kids (my daughter was old enough to drive to my mom's place 2 hours away).

Especially if their are kids. From your post, it sounds like she is neglectful. Not chipping in for house work, or even making sure her children are looked after isn't okay.

Lockdown times with two full time working parents were difficult, I know many families where both parents would take an extra hour off during the day to help with kids", "It's a standard working day in general. However, during 2020, we were both working from home and both of our kids were doing remote school. She would literally isolate herself in the office from 9am to 5 or 6 and get mad if the kids bugged her at all.

You had discussed it together and she was on board and so everything got booked. Then you reminded her when she said she booked her OPTIONAL work thing. She chose to ignore you.

She's the asshole here.", "Unless you've completely and entirely misrepresented the situation, obviously you are NTA.", "NTA. You communicated in advance and she chose to blow it off and then act surprised when you left. She also could have canceled her work trip last minute, as it was optional, if she couldn't find childcare (but it sounds like you arranged backup childcare anyway). Calling you a neglectful dad sounds like an attempt to ruin your peace of mind during the trip.", "NTA unless you're slanting the truth; were you pulling your weight before she got the other job? \n\nWhy didn't you hire a housekeeper? You clearly had the money? \n\nWhy didn't you just ask your mom to take the kids that weekend? Your wife obviously had other things on her mind and that was an easy fix.\n\nI guess you wanted to be taken care of and think that's the wife's job; if you were open to an equal partner there were ways to make it happen, none of which you explored.", "Literally the first line of his post.

You've had a hearing but can have another any time things change.", "Sure, I think we\u2019re more pointing out that her working 9-5 leaves plenty of time to help at home; it\u2019s not like she was pulling 12s in the ER. \nEven if she absolutely couldn\u2019t take time away during the work day she could have started at 7 made breakfast, put something in the crockpot for dinner, started a load of laundry or the dishwasher, then at 6 have time to go over the kids homework, finish up dinner, etc, etc.", "Well luckily the 17 year old can decide for herself in court and there is enough evidence she isn't around enough to have custody.  She just wants your higher salary through child support.", "Ah I thought you meant, why was OP complaining about her working 9-5 and not helping with the kids during that time", "She\u2019s lazy, checked out and liked the arrangement the way it was.", "She wants primary custody and likely child support, since he's the primary right now and it was brought back up due to a custody dispute.", "In another comment, OP explains that the ex is bringing this up in custody court as an example of OP being \u201cneglectful.\u201d  Not sure it\u2019s gonna play out for her the way she thinks\u2026 \ud83d\ude12", "No def not!", "Saw that in his comment that was posted 3 hours after I posed the question."]}
