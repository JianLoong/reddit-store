You might also want to talk with a lawyer in your home country to see if you have any legal recourse.\n\nBut given that you still like your parents and don't want to go LC or NC despite their keeping your money, you might be stuck forgetting that the money exists, saving up, and buying the apartment and furniture on your own.  If your parents bring up the money, you can tell that that you accept that they're keeping your money, but you still love them and don't want to talk about it ever again.
