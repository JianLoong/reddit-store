But he didn't.\n\nThis is not good for the rest of your relationship. Of course his kid should come first always, but it doesn't mean that he can treat you like a doormat or like an afterthought.", "Nta he could\u2019ve sent you a quick text apologising and explaining why he can\u2019t be there\u2019s and that he could\u2019ve made it up to you another day. It\u2019s not even a 2 minute thing", "NTA for being upset. Of course his child has to be his priority, but it was very inconsiderate of him not to communicate with you so that you could have made other plans.", "NTA, you explicitly asked your partner about the day, I know things change, but when they changed, he could have done literally anything to try to salvage the day for you ever if he couldn't spend it with you at the very least he should have appologized with a plan to make it up to you. Being in a relationship with someone with a kid does mean sometimes you are the second priority,  but it doesn't mean that you aren't a priority at all and your bf needs to realize that.", "NTA.  He was rude and inconsiderate to you by not communicating during the day so you could make alternative plans to celebrate your birthday.\n\nAnd despite his brutal day, he should have apologized to you as soon as he got home.\n\nOf course his young son is going to be a priority for him, but it doesn't ever excuse treating you poorly.", "When I read the headline, I was thinking I would proclaim you T A, but upon reading the scenario, you are NTA.\n\nWhere your BF messed up is in his lack of communication to you, you are correct. While emergencies happen, and you can be understanding, he could have alerted you about the situation sooner. And when he came home, he should have been apologizing profusely and offering to take you to dinner the next night.\n\nThat said, he might have been very stressed out about the situation with his son that day and therefore not acting his best self. So, now that you have explained how you feel, and hopefully he understands, he probably deserves a second chance to make it up to you.", "NTA since your main complaint seems to be if he had just communicated with you, you could have made alternate plans.

The boy is still his son and always will be, but the relationship with baby-mama may be more complicated if it\u2019s been longer, or if they were previously married.  Conversely if son is still an infant or toddler, how long have bf and baby-mama been apart?  No need to reply, but am just saying those things can factor in.\n\n*How serious/ permanent is your relationship with your boyfriend?*  Are you contemplating marriage?  Living together?  Spending the majority of your free time together?  Going on dates every weekend?  How serious the two of you are may have affected how much he *thought* he needed to communicate (not that that makes it OK).  Again, just food for thought.\n\nAnyway, after reflecting on these things, maybe explain that you certainly weren\u2019t upset that he had a situation with his son that he needed to deal with.  Acknowledge that it rightfully carried more weight for him than your birthday.  However, based on your previous conversation, you would have appreciated a quick call or text to let you know he was tied up with the situation and unsure how long it would take.  Be sure to stress that you expect him to always make son\u2019s welfare his top priority, but that you\u2019ll be better able to support him if he keeps you in the communication loop.  An apology on his part for the change in plans would probably go a long way here.", "It's a peek behind the curtain of one of two things:\n\n1. His lack of communication skills had a significant negative impact during his relationship with his ex.\n\nOR\n\n2. The verbal abuse his ex heaped on him taught him the wrong lesson that communication is bad and only opens up avenues for abuse.\n\nIf #1 that's a problem for OP to figure out if she can deal with it, if #2 then the partner needs to get into therapy to relearn healthy communication and if he does so, hopefully OP can be patient.", "He could have also taken a few minutes to call and actually speak to her with a verbal apology.  NTA", "I fear I\u2019ve made it not very clear in my title that it isn\u2019t about the fact he spent time with his son. It really was about the lack of communication. I think he\u2019s a fantastic father and I love his kid, we all get on great when we hang out together. \n\nHe\u2019s definitely stressed and maybe I should have been more mindful of that? This is why I\u2019m asking for other viewpoints!", "\u201c He could have told you even in Shirt notice. He left you hanging\u201d\n\nI just cracked up at the mental image of him hanging a shirt with a written apology on it in OP\u2019s window", "And he couldn't call to say \" hey, change of plans, i'll be with the kid\"?? \n\n> You can celebrate your birthday another day.\n\nAnd he can see his kid another day. Or at least communicate with her that he won't be able to spend the day with her. Just because he has a kid doesn't mean she has to be at his beck and call and organize her life based on his kid. \n\n I seriously hope she dumps him cause obviously he has issues with his baby mamma and this is always a recipe for disaster. I'm not the one to say break up, but when there are issues with baby mammas/daddies, i always say run. It's hard enough dealing with a stepkid  , but dealing with a vengeful ex, custody battle, lose so much money on lawyers, part of your income always going to another household... idk how some women do it, no matter how much they love the man, it's not worth it.", "It's NTA for me. He could have just called/texted that he won't be able to make it. That's all she is asking for.\n\nAnd when he did reach home, he didn't even apologize and say that he'll make it up to her.\n\nI know that the CHILD always comes first, but he could have just sent a message.\n\nAnother thing is, he didn't plan anything at all. She was home alone till evening, when he sent those screenshots. OP needs to have a conversation with him about expectations and communication.", "OP seems upset at the lack of communication, not the cancelled plans.", "I feel like if he did that it would\u2019ve been interpreted as him making a half assed attempt to cover himself and he still didn\u2019t fix anything.

How hard would it have been for him to stop and grab you at least a cupcake and throw a candle in it when he showed up at night?! Anything, something small to acknowledge you in any way.\n\nDoes he expect you to contribute financially in this legal battle he intends to start for his son and does he have childcare already figured out if he ends up with 50/50 or full custody?? He doesn\u2019t sound like a planner or someone who is considerate of others time and that usually doesn\u2019t get better when you add a child into the mix.\n\nNTA and you\u2019re only 10 months in the relationship\u2026.I\u2019d be looking for an exit if I were you or at least making an exit strategy if his inconsiderate behavior continues or if you don\u2019t even get a freaking apology!!", "So he left to run an errand for his mom and was supposed to get back to you in the afternoon but didn't text you until  5 pm? Are you sure that he had any intention to spend the day with you? You said he hadn't planned anything beforehand. Sorry. It just seems suspicious.", "Was it a considerate gift? Just trying to establish if he made an effort or just handed you a gift card. \n\nYes he should have communicated better and he should have told you that he really missed his son and wanted to see him now that he had the chance. \n\nAnd ask yourself if this is too much drama for you. He doesn\u2019t really have the time for you. His conflict with his ex means a lot of drama and you constantly having to be a low priority. It\u2019s been like this for 10 months and he still hasn\u2019t done the work to get custody on paper. That is telling me a lot.", "Nta he literally could have came home after seeing his son and still taken you out.  He could have taken you grab dinner and gone to the movies. He could have tried to do both but he failed to communicate properly with you. Sending screenshots and that's it isn't much communication.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with him spending time with his kid but I don't think he honestly had something plan for your birthday. You had the rest of the night with him and he just didn't seem to care to try to do something nice and simple for you.", "NTA he\u2019s just not ready to be in a relationship. His focus is his mom, and his kid, and his ex. He\u2019s shown you that, and I think you deserve better.\n\nDoesn\u2019t really seem like he thinks about you, or cares much at all that he hurts your feelings.", "NTA. I\u2019m a step mom and have been with my partner for 6 years. Even in the early days of dating when he was going through a VERY difficult divorce and custody battle he would NEVER have done this to me. This man is not ready to date.", "How is someone you haven\u2019t dated for a full year a \u201cpartner\u201d? Sounds more like a boyfriend.\n\nESH.", "Yta if it was already a scheduled planned day and you expected him to change it for your birthday if their was already a risk of loosing the time.", "YTA. Im sorry but a partner of only 10 months take a backseat to a kid.", ">I argued with my partner about the fact that he didn\u2019t come through on his promise to celebrate with my birthday with me and he spent it with his son instead without telling me. I might be the asshole because he was having a tough day with his ex being difficult and because he has a responsibility as a dad.\n\nIn this precise context here, YTA.\n\nAn adult birthday isn't more important than a parent takinf care of their child's needs.\n\nDon't get me wrong, your SO could have handled it many different better ways, but you are supposed to be the adult in it all and realize that birthdays are just that and not important events that require something to happen on that precise day.\n\nAnd it's even OK that you feel hurt in it all, but not OK to put your emotional fragility on someone that was taking care of their kid in need.", "NTA. It\u2019s his lack of communication and empathy that\u2019s the problem. He could\u2019ve just said \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I know we were going to do something fun for your birthday today but I just need to see my son for a bit as\u2026\u2026we\u2019ll do something nice when I get back\u201d even just that would\u2019ve made it better. \n\nHe also seems to have lied about even bothering to plan you something which makes him a lying knob in my books.\n\nYou\u2019ve only been together 10 months so far and this is probably what it\u2019s gonna look like for the rest, there\u2019s still time to get out \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA. In sending those screenshots he knew he should have opened up and at least apologized but can\u2019t even step over the small hump of typing in a couple sentences. He needs to work on his communication skills. It\u2019s going to be a lot of work on both of your parts. His: working through using new communication skills. Yours: trying to be patient with him if you can. As a male myself, it was very difficult to get to the point of solid communication, even now sometimes I could say more but it took couples counseling, focus on using tools from those meetings, and feeling like an outlier in the relationship before I could do better. Wether or not you\u2019re willing to work on those things with him is up to you. Heads up, quite a bit of men lack communication skills but not some were raised differently or have worked on these things.", "NTA. He should have updated you. That being said, it sounds like he is a living dad dealing with an ex who uses his child to hurt and manipulate him.  If this lack of communication and broken promise thing isn\u2019t a habit, give him a break.  Have a calm adult talk. Tell him you know he loves his child, you think he\u2019s a wonderful dad, you\u2019re glad he was there for his kid, you understand the change of plans was out of his control, you are just hurt he didn\u2019t tell you sooner.  Listen, work it out.  And by all means tell him you are happy to reschedule your birthday celebration with him.", "NTA. Sounds like he didn\u2019t put any real thought into your birthday like he said he would, besides talking about potential activities, initially, with you and getting a gift. So he\u2019s not apologizing because he doesn\u2019t think he dropped the ball on anything. Did his ex scramble his brain while he was out??\n\nIt didn\u2019t dawn on him to suggest including his son and doing something with the three of you? Then at least you wouldn\u2019t have been left alone.\n\nI don\u2019t understand how people survive without basic communication skills.. I\u2019m sorry you had a crappy birthday. You get a birthday week now.. the whole week!", "INFO: do you already live together after only 10 months?", "NTA\n\nThis has nothing to do with the fact that he left you alone on your birthday.  It has everything to do with a lack of communication.  You have already discussed getting custody of his son so you\u2019re aware of what he has been dealing with.  He could have sent you a quick text or given you a call but he didn\u2019t.  Could the three of you spent the day together? Why didn\u2019t he think of that as an option?", "NTA but look really carefully at this situation: is the ex playing the game where she makes drama and disrupts your life on purpose using the child as an excuse? \n\nIf she is always pulling some trick to get your partner to jump, and he jumps for her and leaves you waiting at home, think about whether you want to be part of her game for the long run. She can play this game forever if your partner allows it. And it is \"for the child\" so it is a way for her to always win, you lose her game because it is her and your partner who play the game. Be careful.", "He could\u2019ve come home and apologized, and told her that he\u2019s going to make it right. He was going to spend the next day or weekend which ever with just her. Take her to a beautiful restaurant and a nice dinner with flowers etc.\n\nIf he really cared he would\u2019ve at least brought her flowers home he didn\u2019t seem to care. Dating someone with children this is gonna be normal. While it\u2019s not his fault he could have made this right. He just didn\u2019t seem to care.\n\nSo this is something that you have to think about what you want and need. Having a child and an ex really is not pleasant in most circumstances for the SO. If you want to be in this for the long term and you really need to sit down and figure out how this is going to work. His child has to come first regardless.", "NTA.\nBut break up immediately with this AH.\nAnd don't date people with kids. It's a nightmare. Every FUCKING time. Let those with kids date other people with kids and let them figure it out", "NTA.  You don't tell someone to \"leave it to me\" and then do nothing.  It honestly sounds like he never planned on doing anything and took opportunities to go to other places to find an excuse.", "NTA. \n\nPrior any issue with his son he'd already \n\nA) promised he'd arrange something for you and didn't \n\nB) arranged to run errands for his mother. \n\nIf an emergency with his son was the ONLY thing AND he was communicative and apologetic that would be one thing. \n\nBut this is another thing entirely,  and that is that you are so far off the bottom of his priority list that he's comfortable making birthday promises he has no intention of keeping. On your first birthday in a relationship with him. After 10 months. \n\nHe will not get better from here.", "NTA For a start, after telling you he would arrange something, he clearly didn't do that. Secondly, he he failed to properly communicate with you and apologise for the change in plans. Not great. However this is your first birthday in this relationship so it is a good opportunity to set better expectations. In adulthood, some people aren't very bothered about their own birthday so would be happy with a casual dinner and other people expect more. You maybe need to be clearer about what you want to happen in the future. He should apologise for the lack of communication either way.", "Also, notice that he'd already booked the entire morning for a \"quick errand\" for his mom. A good chunk of the time he ignored her was not related at all to his son. He's just not prioritizing OP, even on her birthday, even after commiting to it.", "Agree strongly. Taking out 30 seconds to send a text isn't a big ask. \n\nIt's showing basic consideration to your partner.", "Entirely this. I've had dinner dates with my wife end up getting cancelled because something came up at work. I will call my wife, let her know, but will also get food delivered to our house (pre paid) because I said that I would take care of dinner. It's the little things that we can do to show that we are thinking about more than just ourselves.", "Doesn\u2019t really seem like he thinks about you, or cares much at all that he hurts your feelings.", "This is a really helpful comment and will definitely feed into a conversation we\u2019ll have later, thank-you Pansy", "I had the same thoughts.  I'm curious if things with the ex only blew up that day or if they have been brewing and he left for \"an errand\" to deal with it and it just got worse.  Either way his communication is terrible and he's a jerk", "That\u2019s just not true. I\u2019m a stepmom of 6 years and my partner would absolutely not do this. Not even when he was having a messy custody dispute. Communication costs nothing. Heck OP mentioned she has met the kid so why should this not have just turned into a group day. They could have gone and done something as a trio instead and/or her partner could have told her he would make it up to her another time. Just because someone is a parent doesn\u2019t mean that their life stops. A good parent knows that taking care of their relationships is important to the wellbeing of their children. My partner would likely have arranged for his parents to take his children or would have made it a kid day and planned something for just us another day. He would never ever leave me alone on my birthday. Plans change, but that doesn\u2019t mean he has to just abandon his girlfriend at the drop of the hat. He also involved OP in his relationship drama by forwarding her the texts. This shows a distinct lack of boundaries on his part. He needs to insulate his partner and child from that drama. Op should be careful with this guy. He will likely allow his ex to disrupt other occasions and will involve OP in his baby mama drama. That is not necessary.

You sound really lovely and respectful of a single parent\u2019s priority being their kid, and you deserve better. This guy threw you to the side like a used tissue on your birthday in a way that could only happen if he was generally an inconsiderate ass, not if this was a one-off experience. I think this is him showing his true colors 10 months into the relationship, right in the time frame where a lot of masks start to fall in long-term relationships. \n\nI hope you can have a do\u2014over with family or friends soon.", "NTA- You aren\u2019t married to the guy yet and it\u2019s so much unnecessary drama. I\u2019m in the middle of this with an abusive ex who shares 50/50 custody. We\u2019ve dealt with parental alienation, stalking, lying about them taking our child out of state, an abusive bf who moved in with ex and child after it was forbidden by courts. The list goes on and on. It has really made life miserable, not only for our kiddo who has to spend half the time with the massively abusive ex, but also for my spouse and our other kids. It\u2019s a literal nightmare and it will last well beyond our kid\u2019s 18th bday which is still nearly a decade away. Do you want to continue this? Your BF needs to go to family court and save all the abusive texts and try to get a restraining order, if possible. He probably won\u2019t, though. Stay if you must, but you two haven\u2019t been together that long.", "NTA", "I\u2019ve known several men who promised their GF a special event for birthday, anniversary, etc. and then came through with nothing at all.  In each case it was the last day of the relationship.  NTA", "NTA. If he had actually planned something, he could have told you and if he couldn\u2019t make it you could have taken a friend. Instead he just let you sit at home without even attempting decent communication. \n\nLet\u2019s be real, dude didn\u2019t plan anything for you and cared so little that instead of apologizing and doing anything to make it up to you, he sat around talking about himself and his plans. Are you sure he\u2019s into you and ready for a real relationship because I feel like he has some serious issues.", "NTA. You should be #2 on his priority list but clearly you are not. This is a preview of things to come\u2026cut this one loose.", "Never date baby daddies. This won\u2019t change if she\u2019s crazy already.", "If your sole concern really is that he didn't communicate honestly with you, then NTA. He could've dropped you a text telling you that he was busy with his son and, unfortunately, didn't know when he'd be home to celebrate your birthday with you.", "Or maybe he just doesn\u2019t value her", "[removed]", "[removed]", "Listen to his actions they're shocking.", "Thank you, she does.", "Yeah, I'm not feeling great about OP's partner on this...a whole lot of courtesy has been overlooked and that's a HUGE red flag.", "He also hadn't planned anything even before the day went to shit.", "[removed]", "YTA. He could have apologized. But it sounds like he has a very difficult day and his focus was (rightly) on how to see his son more/consistently. \n\nYou can do something another day, it\u2019s not a big deal. \n\nThat being said, you mentioned your partner coming home- do you already live together?", "NTA\n\nIt really has nothing to do with what happened that day with his ex and his son, because he didn't actually plan anything for you like he said he would. \n\nOP it sounds like if he'd planned something and then needed to cancel because of the issues with his ex and needing to be there for his son, you would have understood and appreciated \"the thought that counts.\"\n\nHe ended up having a sympathetic smoke screen to obscure that he misled you and didn't put in the effort he said he would, but that's just coincidence and you can totally hold him accountable for this as a totally separate issue from him being a father to his son.", "NTA Fine. His kid comes first, but you don't matter enough for him to care or be honest with you. I wouldn't care enough to stay with him.", "Don\u2019t date ppl with kids. If they are good parents you will never be their priority so he would choose his son and you will have to spend your birthday alone.", "NTA, plain and simple. Next time, make backup plans.", "ESH\u2026 as someone dating a dad, his son is his top priority. And if shit hits the fan with ex wife regarding son, he becomes hyper focused on son. Dating a dad means understanding that but that isn\u2019t an excuse to not communicate.", "NTA\n\nSorry to say but for how he respond to all of that, or better tha lack of response, he doesn't deservs you. You can do better.", "Your feelings are absolutely valid.  And you have every right to voice your frustration and disappointment.  Especially after he seemed to try to brush everything aside.  He should have at least acknowledged that he messed up, apologized and then provide an explanation as to why he chose not to deliver on his bday promises.  \n\nParents will usually prioritize their children over anything else (as they should).  It doesn't mean they don't care about other people.  But if it's a choice between hurting you or being there for his son, he's going to choose being there for his son.  That dynamic will not likely change during the course of your relationship.  You have to decide if that's something you can learn to deal with or you come to the conclusion that you need to be the top priority in this relationship.  There is no right answer just the right answer for you.\n\nNTA.  Your reaction to the situation is completely understandable.", "That is gaslighting.  You weren't upset he spent time with his son.  You were upset about the lack of communication.  His son will always be his top priority, but that does not negate his need communicate.  The irony is he probably would have communicated that with a friend.  You deserve the same courtesy.", "NTA: All you wanted was a text. He was treating you like an option on your birthday.", "You are dating a man with a child - the welfare and needs of his child will always and must always come first.   That's the reality of your current situation.", "INFO: What errand did he need to do for his mom that took 5+ hours ( morning-5pm)? Also 5pm is no longer \"afternoon\".", " Parents will usually prioritize their children over anything else (as they should). It doesn't mean they don't care about other people. B", "This should be the top comment. I think the unforeseen circumstance with the son is less of a red flag than both the lying about planning something and making plans with his mother instead!", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Possibly causing other grief too.", "Bingo, Touch\u00e9", "As somebody with a stress based disorder, who gets confusion often. Even I would remember to text my girlfriend back on her birthday if I had a whole day planned out and couldn't make it.\n\nWhat he did was just straight Disrespectful.", "He never even thought to plan anything ahead for you to do together and then just ran out to spend time with his mother. This guy doesn't value you at all and his communication skill stink. NTA", "Maybe his kids are more important than a grown ass woman?", "I dumped one of my exes for this exact reason. We made plans for lunch, after our normal lunch time (we hadn't made plans for an exact time), I text and asked if we were still on/what time. They had eaten lunch an hour before with their mom. Had no respect for me and my time.", "But he can prioritise his kid without being an ahole to OP. Instead of just sending a screenshot and letting her draw her own conclusions he could've sent her a text clearly stating that he has the chance to spend time with his son and he's sorry he's going back on his word. Then when he comes home... he should acknowledge that he did fuck all for her birthday, give some sort of apology or do something nice. NOT come in and just talk about his own issues with zero thought to OP."]}
