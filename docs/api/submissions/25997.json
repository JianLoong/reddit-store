A week or so ago I reminded my partner of 10 months about it and asked him if he was free to celebrate with me. I know he has certain days with his son (from a previous relationship) so I wanted to check ahead of time and was prepared to make alternative plans if not.\n\nNot only was he free but he said \u2018leave it to me, I\u2019ll handle it\u2019.  We discussed different activities I\u2019d enjoy doing and honestly I was excited at the prospect of having someone else plan something for me as I had spent my last birthday alone. \n\nCut to the day of my birthday and my partner gives me a gift, says happy birthday and then tells me he\u2019s going out. He has to run an errand for his mum but will be back later to do \u2018something\u2019 in the afternoon. It dawned on me that he hadn\u2019t booked anything specific but ok.. maybe we can do something last minute. It\u2019s gets to 5pm and I receive a message with a screenshot of some verbally abusive texts he had received from the mother of his child and saying he was \u2018having a nightmare of a day\u2019.\n\nI gathered from the details in the screenshot that he would be spending the day with his son and not celebrating my birthday with me. For context my partners ex had been denying access to his son for a few days and I guess he took the opportunity to see his son while he could. My partner came home at 8.30pm, no apology or even acknowledgment of the change in plans. He began talking to me about starting a legal battle for his son (something we have discussed before).\n\nI was upset and told him I was angry at him for his lack of communication and that I could have arranged something with a friend or family if I had known he wouldn\u2019t be there instead of spending the day alone. I\u2019m new to dating someone with a child and understand his son is my partners top priority but AITA for arguing with my partner about this and not being more empathetic to his situation?\n\nEDIT: This is about the communication around spending the day with his son, not about the fact that my partner spent time with him. I love his son, we get on great and my partner is an excellent father.

I'll make it up to you.\" Or anything else that ressembles an apology and feeling bad he had to go back on his word to do something for your birthday. But he didn't.\n\nThis is not good for the rest of your relationship. Of course his kid should come first always, but it doesn't mean that he can treat you like a doormat or like an afterthought.", "Nta he could\u2019ve sent you a quick text apologising and explaining why he can\u2019t be there\u2019s and that he could\u2019ve made it up to you another day. It\u2019s not even a 2 minute thing", "NTA for being upset. Of course his child has to be his priority, but it was very inconsiderate of him not to communicate with you so that you could have made other plans.", "NTA, you explicitly asked your partner about the day, I know things change, but when they changed, he could have done literally anything to try to salvage the day for you ever if he couldn't spend it with you at the very least he should have appologized with a plan to make it up to you. Being in a relationship with someone with a kid does mean sometimes you are the second priority,  but it doesn't mean that you aren't a priority at all and your bf needs to realize that.", "NTA.  He was rude and inconsiderate to you by not communicating during the day so you could make alternative plans to celebrate your birthday.\n\nAnd despite his brutal day, he should have apologized to you as soon as he got home.\n\nOf course his young son is going to be a priority for him, but it doesn't ever excuse treating you poorly.", "When I read the headline, I was thinking I would proclaim you T A, but upon reading the scenario, you are NTA.\n\nWhere your BF messed up is in his lack of communication to you, you are correct. While emergencies happen, and you can be understanding, he could have alerted you about the situation sooner. And when he came home, he should have been apologizing profusely and offering to take you to dinner the next night.\n\nThat said, he might have been very stressed out about the situation with his son that day and therefore not acting his best self. So, now that you have explained how you feel, and hopefully he understands, he probably deserves a second chance to make it up to you.", "NTA since your main complaint seems to be if he had just communicated with you, you could have made alternate plans. Even a quick text of \"situation with [son] blew up, sorry I won't be able to celebrate your birthday with you,\" would have sufficed.", "NTA. BUT\n\nThis is what it\u2019s going to look like dating someone with a child. His communication sucked here and I would 100% be upset as well but I would also understand that no matter what his child will and should always come first.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be upset that he had to take his son for the day but I would be very clear about the fact that he needs to tell me when something like this happens so I\u2019m not sitting around waiting for him when he knows there is a possibility it won\u2019t be able to happen.\n\nA simple I\u2019m not mad it happened I\u2019m mad you didn\u2019t communicate what was happening. I don\u2019t need all the details but a quick hey I\u2019m sorry but I have my son unexpectedly and I\u2019m not sure how long it\u2019s going to be. That way if I want to still do something I can. \n\nThis is something that can and probably will happen time and time again even with proper communication so you really need to think about if it\u2019s something you want to deal with long term.", "NTA He could have told you even in Shirt notice. He left you hanging", "YTA Sorry, but whatever was happening with his son has to come before you.  Whether we are talking about a mother or a father, the child ALWAYS comes first.    You can celebrate your birthday another day.", "ESH. He should have communicated better and apologized when he got home. You have a right to be disappointed but you are dating a father, and he is obviously going through a lot and is upset that his ex is playing games with his visitation time. You should have waited to talk about your feelings and been supportive of him.", "YTA for your blasting of him.  His kid will trump a 10 month old relationship and will contiue to be a part of his life.  Do you know what he had been dealing with or the history?  Sounds like it would have not been a good day for a bday anyway - take it another day.\n\nYes, he was TA for the lack of communication - he could have given more info.", "YTA but he could have been better at communicating", "YTA.  Is your birthday more important than your partner's family situation?  You sound like a child.", "YTA. This was clearly last minute BS he had to deal with. You sound selfish especially for only being with him for 10 MO.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The boy is still his son and always will be, but the relationship with baby-mama may be more complicated if it\u2019s been longer, or if they were previously married.  Conversely if son is still an infant or toddler, how long have bf and baby-mama been apart?  No need to reply, but am just saying those things can factor in.\n\n*How serious/ permanent is your relationship with your boyfriend?*  Are you contemplating marriage?  Living together?  Spending the majority of your free time together?  Going on dates every weekend?  How serious the two of you are may have affected how much he *thought* he needed to communicate (not that that makes it OK).  Again, just food for thought.\n\nAnyway, after reflecting on these things, maybe explain that you certainly weren\u2019t upset that he had a situation with his son that he needed to deal with.  Acknowledge that it rightfully carried more weight for him than your birthday.  However, based on your previous conversation, you would have appreciated a quick call or text to let you know he was tied up with the situation and unsure how long it would take.  Be sure to stress that you expect him to always make son\u2019s welfare his top priority, but that you\u2019ll be better able to support him if he keeps you in the communication loop.  An apology on his part for the change in plans would probably go a long way here.", "It's a peek behind the curtain of one of two things:\n\n1. His lack of communication skills had a significant negative impact during his relationship with his ex.\n\nOR\n\n2. The verbal abuse his ex heaped on him taught him the wrong lesson that communication is bad and only opens up avenues for abuse.\n\nIf #1 that's a problem for OP to figure out if she can deal with it, if #2 then the partner needs to get into therapy to relearn healthy communication and if he does so, hopefully OP can be patient.", "He could have also taken a few minutes to call and actually speak to her with a verbal apology.  NTA", "I fear I\u2019ve made it not very clear in my title that it isn\u2019t about the fact he spent time with his son. It really was about the lack of communication. I think he\u2019s a fantastic father and I love his kid, we all get on great when we hang out together. \n\nHe\u2019s definitely stressed and maybe I should have been more mindful of that? This is why I\u2019m asking for other viewpoints!", "\u201c He could have told you even in Shirt notice. He left you hanging\u201d\n\nI just cracked up at the mental image of him hanging a shirt with a written apology on it in OP\u2019s window", "And he couldn't call to say \" hey, change of plans, i'll be with the kid\"?? \n\n> You can celebrate your birthday another day.\n\nAnd he can see his kid another day. Or at least communicate with her that he won't be able to spend the day with her. Just because he has a kid doesn't mean she has to be at his beck and call and organize her life based on his kid. \n\n I seriously hope she dumps him cause obviously he has issues with his baby mamma and this is always a recipe for disaster. I'm not the one to say break up, but when there are issues with baby mammas/daddies, i always say run. It's hard enough dealing with a stepkid  , but dealing with a vengeful ex, custody battle, lose so much money on lawyers, part of your income always going to another household... idk how some women do it, no matter how much they love the man, it's not worth it.", "It's NTA for me. He could have just called/texted that he won't be able to make it. That's all she is asking for.\n\nAnd when he did reach home, he didn't even apologize and say that he'll make it up to her.\n\nI know that the CHILD always comes first, but he could have just sent a message.\n\nAnother thing is, he didn't plan anything at all. She was home alone till evening, when he sent those screenshots. OP needs to have a conversation with him about expectations and communication.", "OP seems upset at the lack of communication, not the cancelled plans.", "I feel like if he did that it would\u2019ve been interpreted as him making a half assed attempt to cover himself and he still didn\u2019t fix anything. I\u2019m really split on this post ngl", "You really should have made that clear bc even reading through it I felt jealous step mom bleeding through. I don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re that person though", "\ud83d\ude02 your right. Hes a 'wet Shirt' or in German 'ein Lappen'(dork)\n\nDamn my Smartphone changes english to German (how It's supposed to) but sometimes i don't see it", "He can\u2019t see his kid another day if his baby mama is is trying to fuck up his visitation days so he can\u2019t see his child which is exactly what\u2019s going. The child will always trump a 10 month relationship."]}
