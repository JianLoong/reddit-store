I understand that it is hard for a child to see someone else with something that they want. I understand that the mother should have planned to entertain her child.I understand that the mom could have easily given her phone to her child but chose not to. I understand that none of this means her child\u2018s entertainment is your responsibility.\n\nYou can be extremely understanding and still not have any need to risk handing something fragile over to strangers.\n\nI don\u2019t understand why forgetting cranberries would have resulted in a delay worth taking a bus ride. You just run in to the nearest grocery store and buy what you need. Certainly the people who live near your grandparents house have a place to buy groceries.", "NTA.

You were right to ask her if she brought him entertainment.  The kid was hers, not yours to take care of.  Parents shouldn't let a kid's disability be a crutch.  It's a rough path to always be blaming a neurodivergence or disability.", "[removed]", "NTA\n\nNot your problem to entertain other people's kids.", "NTA  \nNot your kid, not your problem to entertain. Mom shoulda brought her kid entertainment instead of insisting to use a STRANGERS iPad.", "NTA. You never have to entertain some else's kids. Doesn't matter if they have ADHD, whether you have expensive electronics or a yo-yo. This is not your kid. You do not have to entertain them or give anything of yours or your child's.", "NTA. Not your fault she didn't bring enough for her child. But why would you take the bus and not wait in the car?", "I have ADHD and I am horrified by this behavior. Sure we might be more impulsive and more easily bored but either we plan for it, or the people in our lives should plan for it if we are too young to do so. I always have something to do whether it's a game on my phone, an article/book to read, one of my pocket sketchpads etc. Her poor planning does not entitle her to your stuff.", "NTA \u2014 electronics are expensive to replace. The person can ask, they shouldn\u2019t be demanding to use it. Good on you.", "No. You do not need to be more understanding towards the kid with ADHD.\n\nIt is PURELY his mother's responsibility to pack things for him to do. She could give him HER phone to play roblox but my guess is she wants to waste time on it instead. She could have packed all sorts of stuff for him to do.\n\nWhen it comes to electronics, do not share them with strangers. If this was a coloring book and crayons I'd say Y T A but you are most definitely NTA not wanting to share the ipad with a random kid and their super entitled Mom.", "NTA. You were absolutely correct, she should\u2019ve brought some form of entertainment for that kid.", "NTA- You are not responsible for entertaining another person\u2019s child. If the child has ADHD, it\u2019s her responsibility to keep him entertained. I\u2019m also fairly certain you would not have grown the IPad back after 5 minutes.", "NTA, if her kid needed it, she should've got off her phone & have that to her child.", "NTA. You don't owe it to anyone to entertain their children for them. If this mother was really so worried about keeping her child occupied she could have brought a book of puzzles or a handheld gaming system or something else. That's what my mom used to do since I have ADHD. I filled out so many word searches, logic puzzles and sudoku while waiting places and taking car rides.
