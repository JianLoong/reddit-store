I understand that it is hard for a child to see someone else with something that they want. I understand that the mother should have planned to entertain her child.I understand that the mom could have easily given her phone to her child but chose not to. I understand that none of this means her child\u2018s entertainment is your responsibility.\n\nYou can be extremely understanding and still not have any need to risk handing something fragile over to strangers.\n\nI don\u2019t understand why forgetting cranberries would have resulted in a delay worth taking a bus ride.

Not your fault she didn't bring enough for her child. But why would you take the bus and not wait in the car?", "I have ADHD and I am horrified by this behavior. Sure we might be more impulsive and more easily bored but either we plan for it, or the people in our lives should plan for it if we are too young to do so.

She could give him HER phone to play roblox but my guess is she wants to waste time on it instead. She could have packed all sorts of stuff for him to do.\n\nWhen it comes to electronics, do not share them with strangers.

You don't owe it to anyone to entertain their children for them. If this mother was really so worried about keeping her child occupied she could have brought a book of puzzles or a handheld gaming system or something else.
