I use tuna, Kewpie mayonnaise, spicy brown mustard, celery, onion, garlic, pickles, lemon juice, pickle juice, salt, and black pepper.

Today she asked me to make tuna salad, but when she saw me preparing all the ingredients, she demanded no onion.  I told her that I always put onion in it, and she's always loved it, but she persisted that she \"doesn't like onions,\" which makes no sense.\n\nEventually I said fine, I'll leave the onion out.  After she left the kitchen, I quickly chopped the onion and added it, betting on the fact that she wouldn't be able to tell that it was in there.  I served it to her open faced on an everything bagel and turned out to be right because she immediately gobbled up every last bite and said it was great.\n\nBut later in the afternoon, she saw the onion peel in the trash can and figured out that I had added it.  She got mad at me, even after I told her that she obviously liked it.  She said it was \"disrespectful.\"  Honestly I love her, but I'm just so tired of her picky eating.

Or you could have told her that you were putting onions in the tuna, and if she didn\u2019t want to eat it that way, she could eat something else", "NTA\n\nI bet if you left out the onion she would complain the salad didn't taste as good.\n\nIt's clearly not an allergy", "My husband only likes mayo in tuna. Mine is mostly like yours except apples in it are even better and it will super gross out the picky eater.", "I lied to my GF, aita? Yes, yes you are TA. I'm 42 and I've never liked onions. This is apparently hard for you to understand,  but some people don't like certain things.....ever!  But really, don't mess with people's foods, and don't lie to them and then act confused when they're upset.", "YTA she made a simple request and you broke her trust.", "NTA I have this same exact argument about tuna salad. The solution is to put the onions in last and scoop out a serving before you add them. If they want more they can have it with the onions.", "ESH. He shouldn\u2019t have put still put onions in it, yes, but his girlfriend was being stubborn as shit. She couldn\u2019t taste the onion. She couldn\u2019t feel the onion. She couldn\u2019t smell the onion. She never had the previous however many times she\u2019d had the meal. She just demanded it not be in the meal for the hell it, and expected OP to make the meal THEY were making to HER liking. His fuck up was obviously lying about not putting it in. He should have just stood his ground originally.", "YTA She asked for it without onions and you still did it. She trusted you and you broke that trust. Besides that lots of people refuse to eat a lot of things. Age is irrelevant. I absolutely will NOT eat uncooked onions, uncooked celery, I'll eat tuna once or twice a year, there's a variety of cuts of meat I won't touch (nevermind veal, lamb, caribou or elk) Would it have hurt you to only put onions in your portion?", "You are both kinda wrong.  You should not have lied & she should have admitted that since she liked it when you made it before, then you should make it the same way again. Next time, do what I do when I make potato salad for our family.  I make it completely except for the onions. I take half out & put it in a bowl & then add onions to the last half.  Then people can choose what they like.  You are right she DID like onions the way you made it, however, to avoid ridiculous petty arguments, just leave them out of her half. Maybe she will even be disappointed in the salad without the onions. Who knows. Anyway, I am sure there are things you don't like. If you put mushrooms on my pizza, I will pick off all the big ones.  LOL", "YTA. Don\u2019t sneak things into others food. Might I suggest subbing green onions and just topping your tuna before you put top bread on? Maximum flavor and CRONCH without harming anyone else\u2019s food. And also a sprinkle of dill.", "YTA  \n\"My girlfriend saw me making something, not realizing I always put and ingrediant in it asked for that not to be there. Me knowing better then her lied about it because she has know clue what she is talking about, and is now upset I lied\"    \n\n\nOP it does not matter if you are 100% right or wrong about her dislike of onions and always liking it before.  You decided to betray trust, granted in a small way, but still a betrayal and remove her personal decision about what to eat.  Never lie about food.", "NTA.  If she wants it a certain way she should make her own.  Particularly since she\u2019s eaten it prior with no complaint.", "YTA here but let me try your recipe.", "YTA for saying you will not add onion, but you did it anyway. \n\nMy father hates onion's too. My mother adds onion powder to her food instead of raw onions.", "Look dude I hate picky eaters too but you do NOT mess with someone\u2019s food. Ever. Yta", "YTA don\u2019t tell her you\u2019re gonna do something and not follow through. You could just separate it and put the tuna with onions in a different container or something. And picky eating does not just go away once you\u2019re older and it doesn\u2019t mean people who are picky are immature, usually they have a disability which causes them to be picky due to sensory issues.", "NTA - she ate it, she liked it, she\u2019s still alive. \n\nStop making tuna salad for her because next time you do and this happens, then YTA. \n\nI\u2019ll get downvoted for this. \nNo food allergies or serious issues with onions = chill out, it\u2019s not the end of the world people.  Onions are actually really good for you.", "As an actual onion and garlic hater, I can smell and taste them instantly. If this wasn\u2019t the case, I\u2019d have no problem eating them. And your gf doesn\u2019t seem to have a problem either, maybe only with the thought of eating onions, but not with actually eating them. NTA", "Some people get gas if they eat onions. She might like them but doesn't want to eat them. \n\n\nBesides that- you lied to her. So, yes, YTA", "ESH. Just don\u2019t make her food anymore.", "I used to have a close friend that had food aversions at 39 years old. She claimed they caused stomach issues for her. Onions, peppers, tomatoes, she couldn't eat any of those. We were both single mothers and so we ate a lot of meals together. I felt annoyed at times that I had to make adjustments to certain recipes. (meatloaf....who wants just hamburger and bacon?! I want peppers, onions and tomatoes in mine!) If I ever bought a pre made item I'd check to see where on the ingredient list onion was. If it was trace amounts, or even just onion powder she could possibly tolerate it. I'd always inform her in advance, so that she didn't have to read the label herself. THAT is what you do when you love someone. Not make it with the ingredients they ask you to NOT use, and try to hide it from them. OP, you're the asshole.", "OP this makes no sense she has multiple times eaten this recipe but decides no onions because she sees them so no allergy involved. This is ridiculous behaviour and should have been dealt with as a child. Three options she can make her own food, you can make it as she asks or you lose the whole girlfriend because this will not be the only picky annoying behaviour it will manifest in more important things and become a sticking point for you. She sounds exhausting", "Exactly this. I ask for no onion bc it makes me violently ill, especially when fresh. If someone agreed and then snuck it in, I'd be doubly upset. One for lying to me, and two for making me violently ill. (I accidentally pico'd myself at GYG the other day and was like \"eh, I'll be fine.\" I was not fine.)", "Exactly. there is a difference between her mentioning the first few times that she would prefer without onion or if it's anything medical. \nI would like to know if it's the first time she saw him prepare that salad. \nIf she saw him do it previously and didn't care, then it wouldn't be a big deal now, since she apparently doesn't taste it anyway. \nNah", "Sure, and he could have said \"if I am making this, I'm making it with onions\". He chose to lie, instead.", "Sorry NTA", "I think the very basics is regular mayo, mustard and celery and then you can doctor it up from there. Can agree that Kewpie does make it better. Oh and celery is the worst.", "I\u2019ve had tuna salad maybe thrice in my life, but it\u2019s always been what the other commenter said. Mayo, mustard, and celery. And tuna of course", "OMG, is that why I hate biting into onions with such a vigorous passion?", "I refuse to eat olives.", "My dad hates the sight of onions in his food, so my mom uses onion powder for everything!", "Sure, he could have said 'if I am making this, I'm making it the way I always do'. Instead he chose to lie.", "Except she ate the salad numerous times with onions and no issues. NTA", "That's already been said and you didn't add anything to the conversation", "Yes, this. I'm not someone who can just eat something I don't enjoy either. I literally cannot put the food in my mouth. My body shuts down. It is infuriating. I have to like the food to be able to eat it. My brain is so annoying sometimes.", "It's not rude to express your preference to someone you trust and care about and think they trust and care about you. He could have just told her no, but he chose to lie and deceive her. Even if I agree with your premise, he still lied and deceived her rather than just tell her the truth of what he was going to do.", "After years of trying I finally found the holy grail of marmite sandwich preparation:\n\nStep 1: Burn the Marmite in the fires of hell. Take the ashes, fertilize a tree with them, then burn the tree.\n\nStep 2: Put literally anything else on your sandwich. Used motoroil from a truck used to haul manure? You\u2019re golden.", "I'm quite a fan of homemade fermented onion and garlic pastes, not because of any texture aversions but because they taste amazing and it's super convenient to just add a few tablespoons rather than dicing onion and garlic!", "My stomach works so slow that I have real problems detecting what causes my cramps and stomach problems. I have ibd and I had to keep food diary to find out what might cause what. Also sometimes I can eat little amount of some food but next time I could get serious pain because of it.", "your existence doesn't add anything", "That is genius. I use so much of both, making my own paste ahead of time would be preferable to dicing.", "That sucks so much. It\u2019s ibs for me, and ppl being casual with my restrictions are ppl i avoid eating around\n\nLike, you might think: maybe it was the combo of oats or fruit in the morning and then a bagel in the afternoon that got you. Or that it\u2019s the type of cracker, or the combo of pickles and arugula - when all the while there were god damn onions in your food and you get a multi-week flare-up of painful and/or embarrassing symptoms", "\u201cBetrayed her trust\u201dis a major stretch \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f And if she so devastated from his \u201cbetrayal\u201d she can make her own food from now on \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Yes, he could have said 'if you want me to make it, I'm going to put onions in it'. He didn't. So it is a lie and a betrayal of trust.", "K"]}
