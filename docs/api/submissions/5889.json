Thankfully she wasn't deep at all and could easily get out.\n\nHer clothes were soaked and unwearable, so everyone just assumed I'd give her something which was annoying to be honest. She has never been very nice to me and my husband has clothes she can wear. I didn't want to give her anything expensive or anything I was attached to. I also didn't want to give her anything at all form fitting because she is smaller than me and would love to gloat about how they were too big.\n\nI offered up a pair of footie pajamas with a bunny tale, warm, meant to be baggy, and I only bought them for Halloween and wouldn't be upset if she lost or ruined them. MIL refused and demanded I let her go through my drawer. I told her it was the pajamas or she could put her wet clothes back on. At this point she still refused and a few other family members began berating me and saying I was being extremely cruel. I'm possessive of my clothes and it is such a personal thing to me. MIL said she would go home in the wet clothes which was ridiculous. It was freezing out and she weighs maybe 110 pounds, so she struggles to stay warm anyway.\n\nHer husband ended up having a pair of sweats in his car and her sister gave her a bathrobe she had gotten for Christmas. MIL refused to speak to me or my husband the rest of the night and I have been called an evil bitch by multiple people. MIL's mom and sister won't even talk to me.

Why couldn't you have just grabbed a hoodie and sweatpants? Tbh your behavior here makes me think MIL may not be as mean as you say - maybe she just doesn't like you because you suck.
