MIL refused and demanded I let her go through my drawer. I told her it was the pajamas or she could put her wet clothes back on. At this point she still refused and a few other family members began berating me and saying I was being extremely cruel. I'm possessive of my clothes and it is such a personal thing to me.

Why couldn't you have just grabbed a hoodie and sweatpants? Tbh your behavior here makes me think MIL may not be as mean as you say - maybe she just doesn't like you because you suck.
