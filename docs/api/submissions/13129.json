Kendall was diagnosed with BPD late last year. She has extreme anxiety and somewhat of a short fuse. She is in therapy and according to her, is talking to her therapist about what happened in this incident. \n\nMy other 2 kids had the tendency to try to bait her and get her to freak out because they think it\u2019s \u201cfunny\u201d. We\u2019ve spoken to them several times, my son has been punished, etc. It got better with the diagnosis and I thought it finally gave my other two kids the push and realization that this isn\u2019t funny and typical sibling stuff. \n\nAva moved out after college but lives nearby and will visit often. This week, the teenagers had a day off due to staff development. Kendall is the type to sleep in if she has nothing else going on, both her siblings know this. I also know she got very little sleep the night before as she anticipated the day off. \n\nAnyway, I leave for work just as Ava is coming in. She didn\u2019t say she was stopping by so it was a welcomed surprise. I tell her Darren is playing video games, Kendall is sleeping.  She said cool and went to join her brother.\n\nAn hour later, I get a call from Ava and she\u2019s pissed. She says that Kendall screamed at her to \u201cget the fuck out of HER house\u201d and wouldn\u2019t stop until Ava actually left. I called Kendall.\n\nShe told me that Ava and Darren came into her room, laughing and shook her until she woke up, then left the room. She tried to go back to sleep but couldn\u2019t. Kendall was exhausted and had a rough week. She ran downstairs and asked what the hell was wrong with them. They kept laughing and told her to calm down. That\u2019s when Kendall screamed at Ava to get out of the house. I told Kendall while of course screaming isn\u2019t the best way, I understood why she did it and she wasn\u2019t in trouble. \n\nI texted Ava and said we\u2019d speak that night, as I did have to work. I went home afterwards and grounded Darren, taking away his XBOX. He then tried to say it was unfair of Kendall to throw Ava out as he wanted her there. I asked why they would do this and they said they wanted Kendall to come to breakfast with them. I told him I didn\u2019t buy that and accused them of just trying to get a rise out of her. He finally owned up to it.\n\nI then went to Ava\u2019s. She said it was a little of both. They wanted to mess with her and thought she\u2019d just get a little upset. She also did genuinely want to buy her breakfast. I said there were so many ways to go about the latter and the former is bull. Ava tried to say it\u2019s unfair that she and Darren can\u2019t treat her like \u201cnormal siblings do\u201d because she could fly off the handle. She pointed out that I always said my home was hers. I said yeah, but Kendall lives there and she has a right to feel safe. It\u2019s not like she tried to kick out Darren. \n\nMy husband backs me up, but Darren and Ava are still pissed. Ava thinks it\u2019s fair for Darren to be punished and her to get a lecture but that Kendall shouldn\u2019t get off Scott free.", "created_utc": 1679717436, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/121a4zr/aita_for_not_punishing_my_middle_child_for/", "score": 403, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You would think she would show some compassion to her sister who is going through a lot right now, but instead she\u2019d rather bully and gaslight her. \n\nI think it\u2019s time to sit Darren and Ava down and set some serious boundaries. This is really disturbing behavior by Ava and she\u2019s teaching Darren that it\u2019s cool to be a bully and a jerk.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\nI guess. \n\nBut why do your children (especially a grown one) delight causing pain to another human? \n\nI find that\u2026disturbing.", "NTA but I don't understand why you are allowing your children to essentially torture their sister. They gang up on her and try to make her explode and then laugh at her anguish. \n\nOne is 25 and engaging in this behavior. That is not a child, you have raised an adult bully picking on a teenager. On top of that the 25 year old is showing a 13 year old that it's ok treat someone like they are garbage and be a bully, in fact, that it's funny when they have a big reaction.\n\nI would not be surprised if your middle kid goes no contact when old enough.", "You\u2019re NTA, they are bullying Kendall and aren\u2019t respecting her. They need to do better", "NTA.\n\nKendal is already in therapy.\n\nBut it may be good to do family therapy too. Clearly the dynamics are not working well. A professional May be able he\u2019ll communication within the family and provide some guidance.\n\nGood luck!", "NTA. you handled things appropriately. This adult child of yours should absolutely know better. I might suggest to her that she not come over when you're not there until you can be more certain she understands her sister's limitations and needs and desires to be sensitive to them. Good luck with all your kids. Mental illness with teenagers is very challenging.", "On behalf of middle children everywhere, NTA", "NTA. Also, in what world does a 25 year old woman do something like that to a 16-year-old. I would seriously have a long discussion with your eldest child because clearly something is very wrong if she thinks that was the right way to do that in any way, shape or form", "NTA  \nSeriously what is wrong with your eldest that she would act this way? The 13 yo I can understand but at 25 that is really messed up.  Maybe some family counseling is in order because this is a recipe for disaster, I see Kendall going NC with her sibs in 2 years very easily.", "NTA\n\nI'm appalled by the behavior of Ava and Darren. Especially with Ava. A younger teenager is already at the point where they can learn to respect a boundary, but they can struggle to understand that a boundary must be constantly and consistently respected. Ava should know far better at this point.\n\nThey knew it wouldn't be funny to anybody else but themselves to shake her awake. They knew she'd have a strong reaction. Anything else is a total lie. They seem to be enjoying themselves when seeking to antagonize somebody who has enough on their plate already and I'm concerned about what this bodes when it comes to others in their lives. Ava is an adult and you can't make her do anything she doesn't want to do other than keeping her away from Kendall. But I'd consider sending Darren for an evaluation as well if he often tries to purposely antagonize Kendall. And in your place I would give Ava a firm non-negotiable assertion: \"You are not a parent to Kendall. You have no position of authority over Kendall. You are in no position to decide what is the correct response from Kendall after antagonizing her. You do not get to debate that Kendall deserves to be punished if you're being reprimanded for your immature behavior that is not befitting to your age. If your antagonism towards Kendall continues, the actual parents of the household will restructure the boundaries of our household to reflect this. Consider this your only warning.\"\n\nIf they have a pattern of entering her room without permission to purposely antagonize her, then I'd suggest if you have the budget for it to get her a number pad lock on her door that you - the parents - and her know the code for and isn't shared with the other two children.", "NTA \nwith a BPD diagnosis, what your other two children are doing is fucking awful. People with BPD tend to misread social cues and assume the negative rather than going with the flow. Waking someone up like that fucking sucks, BPD or otherwise. You did the right thing, Kendall was able to exercise agency and get what she needed. I would however have a sit down with the two of them and check in with why they\u2019re behaving this way. Yes, Kendall has a diagnosis, but growing up with a sibling with BPD can be pretty rough. Check in with the others too.", "Torn between NTA and E S H here, but going with the first.\n\nA 25 year old adult came into your home, and recruited a 13 year old child to bully a 16 year old.  Look, the reaction was a bit much (though I wonder how much further bullying ultimately lead to it), but *any* 16 year old, heck, plenty of adults, would have been quite upset by that wake-up.\n\nThis is *not* \"normal\" sibling behavior at these ages, and why are you even entertaining her argument that it is and that it's somehow unfair that she can't get away with doing this crap?  This was bullying.  *By a full-fledged adult.*  She's *25!*\n\nI can't emphasize this enough.  Your oldest daughter is 25, and she's bullying your minor daughter.  She's recruiting your other minor child into this.  You have a serious Ava problem here.  I wonder how long Ava bullying Kendall has been a problem.", "NTA. Your 25 year old is incredibly immature. She\u2019s old enough to be married with kids but instead she\u2019s messing with her mentally ill sister? What gives? Why is she hanging out at your house and not doing her own thing??", "NTA. Your kids are being bullies.", "NTA but your adult daughter is! BPD can be very hard to manage, especially for a young girl in high school, and what the other two did was horrible. Mental illnesses are real, life-altering things and I can't imagine how hard all of this is for Kendall. Your youngest I think deserves some leeway in that he's 13, you'd be hard pressed to find a boy that age who isn't annoying, but your 25 year old? Inexcusable behavior, she should be the one discouraging the youngest from bullying his sister, not the instigator.\n\nYou are not the asshole in any way, and it is so good to hear that you are taking your child's mental health seriously and working to understand her and the things she experiences. If Ava can't act like an adult in your home and continues to actively create a hostile environment for Kendall, she shouldn't be there imo. It isn't asking too much of her to have empathy and show kindness to her sister.", "Kendall was in bed, asleep, minding her own business.  Why should she get punished?  NTA.", "You need to update the post to specify that it's bipolar disorder.   BPD = borderline personality disorder, which is completely different.\n\nPeople with bipolar disorder need their sleep, period.  Messed up sleep patterns will result in manic episodes.  So not only is Ava a jerk, she's a jerk who delights in mentally abusing a mentally ill minor.  \n\nYou're NTA yet, but you will be if you don't ban Ava from the house anytime you or your husband aren't home AND awake to supervise.  Take away her key and forbid the other kids from letting her in unless the above conditions are met.  I'd give it 3 months, and then have a conversation with Kendall about whether she is comfortable with Ava having free access to the house again.\n\nUp to 60% of bipolar patients will attempt suicide in their lifetime, and up to 20% will complete suicide.  Kendall deserves to feel safe in her own home.", "Ava is the AH here.  OP is, imo, an ineffective parent.  I feel badly for both of the other kids.", "NTA. Your other children still do not get that they can't treat their sister like a normal sibling. They did something that I, not having BPD, would get extremely upset about myself. They thought they'd get a small reaction and instead got a blow-up. It's good that your husband is supporting you in this. You might want to end the punishment and have a sit down with the two normal siblings and give them information on your middle daughter's diagnosis. Have them look it up on their phones while you are talking about it. BPD is not easy to live with, but they don't need to make it harder.", "NTA. Is Kendall on medication? I was diagnosed with BPD as a kid and medication absolutely saved my life.", "NTA.  If she just got her diagnosis then I'm assuming she just started medications and specific treatment geared towards BPD.  This is a crucial time for her.  She is just learning how to manage her issues and her medication may not be working fully or she might not be on the right dosage or combination yet.  That can sometimes take months or over a year.  Doing anything to intentionally set her off will set her back in her learning to manage her symptoms.  Sure it sucks that her siblings can mess with her like a \"normal\" sibling.  Thing is, they need to realize she has a behavioral health issues that needs to be taken seriously and learn to be supportive of that.", "NTA! Good for you for protecting your middle daughter. Not only is sleep important for a teen but being woken up in that fashion would make anyone angry. I would offer to put a lock on her door so this doesn\u2019t happen again in addition I would probably tell the eldest if she does it again she won\u2019t be able to be over when you are not home because the lack of respect she has for her sister and I would tell your son if he does it again he will not get his Xbox back.", "NTA but Ava shouldn't be allowed in the house unsupervised. She's 25 ffs, she knows better and she's being a horrid example for your son to follow. As for the whole \"being able to do like normal siblings\" be it's not like Kendall got to choose her disorder. It sucks for her probably more than anyone else. Props for getting her the help BTW! Keep having her back on this.", "NTA \n\nThe kids need therapy tools to understand BPD. \n\nBPD (Borderline Personality Disorder) comes with a childhood trauma diagnosis always \n\nBipolar Disorder doesn\u2019t. \n\nIf it\u2019s Borderline Personality Disorder then the kids need to understand they are part of her support team and carers and emotional regulation does not come easily to Kendall. \n\nThere are usually carer and family courses you can attend with them", "NTA. Info: Your daughter is diagnosed with bipolar disorder or borderline personality disorder? \n\nBorderline personality disorder can\u2019t be properly diagnosed until adulthood because of how development (especially in teens) can alter the signs and symptoms. This is in the DSM-V. It is also often trauma related, and some think it\u2019s related to PTSD which is hardly surprising with the bullying from her siblings.", "definitely not the asshole", "Was Kendall addressed at all for her extreme reaction in this situation? Yes Kendall needs to feel safe, I 100% agree but for another child to be kicked out and you essentially....agreed to it by choosing not to address it....can be heartbreaking to the other child. In her mind at the end of the day, she's not welcomed nor wanted because what Kendall wants or needs is more important.\n\nI understand she is seeing a therapist and she has BPD but from the little you explained, I can see somewhat see a pattern...\n\nThey are trying to treat her as a normal sibling, she has a condition which causes unfavorable reactions. But if her condition is often given a free pass for being addressed compared to the other two...., it would make resentment grow reguardless. They are at the end of the day all your children. There is a fine line between understanding a condition and feeling you aren't as important to your parent because you don't stand out as much....\n\nIf they see it as favoritism, they probably gave up at one point in making a genuine effort. If they are the only ones often getting in trouble because she gets a pass..... Why bother trying? They are always going to get in trouble anyway. \n\nPerhaps a family therapy session to get everyone's point of view might be helpful? \n\nAgain this is all a perspective from what little information was given. I could be in the left field entirely upon my perspective so don't take any of what I said too seriously. I'm positive you are doing your best!!", "YTA\n\nALL of your kids were in the wrong. The oldest and youngest shouldn\u2019t be intentionally baiting their sister, but your middle one doesn\u2019t get to use her diagnosis to get away with acting however she wants.", "Id say its a bit of both. \nNTA for standing up for your child and their disorder but also YTA for making excuses for her poor behavior from the get go. \n\nBPD is a rough diagnosis. If she continues to see her support system not hold her accountable for her own actions shes going to consider her disorder the reason she acts badly, thus justifying worse behavior. No, her siblings shouldn\u2019t bully her that way but its also unfair to them they have to essentially treat her entirely differently incase she explodes. I wouldnt expect someone close to me to excuse my over-reactions to situations as acceptable just because of my childhood trauma. Rationality is important and learnable. She needs coping mechanisms and her siblings need to not be bullies but also not be expected to walk on egg shells. \n\nShes young, so it takes time. Everyones the asshole when it comes to learning.", "[deleted]", "Nobody is an asshole. This baiting sounds like regular sibling stuff.

I was undiagnosed until I was 21 (I\u2019m 27 now) and did a lot and said a lot of crazy shit. One thing that wasn\u2019t taught in my house was conflict resolution. My dad yelled and threatened people all the time. My stepmom screamed until she got her way. Work with her therapist on better ways for her to resolve conflict.

You need to tell Ava that it is still her home and she will always have a place there, regardless of what Kendall says, but Ava is an adult now and needs to learn how to not start arguments for no reason and discuss how to problem solve in this situation (e.g. maybe she should have texted Kendall that they're going to breakfast soon and that she should join if she likes, then it's okay for Ava Darren to go out without her).

However, that doesn't mean it would be excusable for me to use their condition to trigger them for fun. This is something I've understood since I was about 5 or 6.

That\u2019s also abusive. \n\nMake sure Kendall\u2019s therapist is up to date on BPD treatment.

BPD is a big deal and doesn't just magically start one day, so Ava and Darren have probably been tolerating Kendall's reactivity and other behaviors for years. People get stuck in patterns with that, and just because Kendall is working on changing doesn't mean that dynamic is gone. You and your husband only addressing Ava and Darren and not Kendall is part of that dynamic, too. What are you doing to change how you deal with those things? Honestly it sounds like ESH.", "I think that there should be some consequence for Kendall too. As people like to point out often, a mental health condition is an explanation, not an excuse. \n\nI'm not sure about the claims that Ava and Darren are bullying Kendall. This does seem like pretty normal sibling behaviour, from what I have observed. I'll disclaim that with the admission that I myself am an only child. I think in some regards it lets me observe sibling interactions from a place of neutrality but of course there are other aspects of sibling relationships I just won't ever understand. I'm also a mum of three where health conditions of one child (ASD that took a long time to get diagnosed) resulted in some quite negative experiences for the other two. There were times when I could see them doing things that I knew would set their sister off and of course I didn't want that to happen. But when you take a step back and try to look at the situation objectively you will see that what they're doing isn't outside of their normal activity or isn't outside of the normal way that siblings play off each other - sometimes they are each other's biggest fan and encouragement and sometimes they are each other's nemesis. \n\nI saw another comment here that said something like \"the other two siblings need to learn that they can't just treat Kendal like a normal sibling.\" And while I understand the sentiment behind the statement, I'm not sure if I agree with it or not. Of course, obviously, the world would be a better place if no one ever did anything that would trigger specific vulnerabilities in someone that they have because of a mental health condition. But we know that isn't the reality. It is often repeated on this forum that if you have a condition, it's ok to make people aware of it and to ask for a little grace but that ultimately it is your own responsibility for learning to manage it yourself without expecting everyone else to change their behaviour. We have also seen countless stories from people who were either neglected because of their siblings health needs or had their ability to live their own normal childhood severely limited so that it wouldn't also upset the sibling - and it seems a pretty universal opinion in those cases that the parents who allow this to happen are assholes. \n\nAva and Darren *should* be able to treat Kendall like a normal sibling, because they shouldn't have to change themselves to  let her avoid learning how to manage her medical condition. But at the same time, they are both more than old enough to understand that learning to manage something like bipolar isn't an overnight process and it does come with other needs that it is not unreasonable to expect them to respect and so they need to be able to accept that sometimes they'll do something and their sister might not yet have the tools to react in an ideal way and they will need to deal with the consequences of that.\n\nI don't want to leave a judgement because I think situations like this are much more complex than a simple you are or aren't an asshole. Also OP gave a very brief overview of a single event, which I am sure doesn't come close to explaining all the intricacies of these family relationships and what they have all been through in getting to the point where Kendall was diagnosed and able to start getting the treatment and support she needs.

But you do need to have a proper talk with her about not shouting and how to deal with big emotions.", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t think bullying someone is \u201cnormal sibling behaviour\u201d.", "Imo it's time to sit Darren and Ava down with a therapist so they can hear in detail all the harm they're causing and what awful people they're being to their sister.", "This is not what normal siblings do. My brother and I have a similar age gap as Ava and Kendall, and I never treated him like this. He is my brother. I looked out for him and protected him as best I could. Taught him stuff. Ava is a crappy sister. NTA.", "This...nothing more, nothing less....NTA...the kids need new and safe space boundaries", "yeah I am like wtf, 25 is not a child! what the hell are these people enabling. Ava can be banned from the home unless she behaves. its more esh. these parents need to proactivly protect their daughter not just punish them afterwards", "I'd say some specific support for Darren would be in order too. Something like a young carers / sibling service. This is absolutely not Kendall's fault, but it will be positive for Darren and for his relationship with Kendall if they recognise that her diagnosis has an impact on his life.", "Just to add, BPD treatment also includes a strict sleep regimen as sleeping is harder, brain doesn\u2019t \u2018slow down\u2019 and often needs meds to assist actually falling asleep. Once you are asleep it\u2019s easier to wake up a BPD person as they tend to be the types to startle awake for noises or be hyper vigilant and once their brain is \u2018up\u2019 then that\u2019s it for sleep and they are now in awake mode. \n\n\nIf Kendall struggles to get to sleep or her sleep is broken I\u2019d advise something to help with that. Maybe ask her therapist for their advice on how to set up a sleep routine and things which can help with that including rules for others, such as her siblings. If a doctor is mandating that she be left to sleep, not shaken awake then maybe there will be less disturbance of Kendall. Sometimes people think excessive sleeping equals lazy but if Kendall hasn\u2019t slept well during the night then she desperately needs the sleep or her moods will suffer, if not other things as well. \n\n\nI\u2019m wondering if there is some resentment between the siblings, if they think she\u2019s faking being ill or lazy or trying to get attention. Or if Kendall behaves badly sometimes and this was retaliation for her bad moments.", "Yes she needs to update it. When I heard BPD I was immediately skeptical about whether or not Kendall was a reliable narrator due to my own experiences with people with BPD. Bipolar disorder makes more sense in this context.", "She needs to then not let her child stay up late and stick to a schedule.", "Is seems like it's bipolar disorder.", "Are you me? My childhood was the same way except both my brothers were my bullies and my parents didn\u2019t believe me because they were both younger than me.", "this here. Fine line between understanding a condition and enabling a condition", "It's also that the adult daughter is framing it as \"normal sibling stuff\" when it is not at all. It's just deflection to enable the abuse.", "[removed]", "Maybey Kendall could write a letter detailing what they have done to her and ask for her siblings to have an appointment (without her) with her therapist and ask her therapist to please explain her disorder and why their actions were inappropriate and/or bullying. It might not do anything, but sometimes it's more effective hearing things from non family members.  \n\nNTA,  and Ava might be welcome a back at her parents house but it is Kendall's home and she has everyrught to feel safe in her own home, Darren should be reminded to respect his sister privacy too because barging into her room without it being an emergency is inappropriate and disrespectful at that age, mental health issues aside.", "Exactly my thought. Ava is 9 years older than Kendall and at 25 still finds it entertaining to bully her much younger and vulnerable sister. A 9 year sibling gap is huge and the power/maturity difference makes even a tiny bit of teasing very unbalanced and unfair on the younger sibling. \n\nWhat was going on in that household when Ava was a teenager and Kendall was a young child?? Was kindergarten-age Kendall subjected to bullying by a teenager she could never get away from?", "That was my thought too. My FIL had BPD and he had abusive parents.", "You\u2019re supposed to be a parent. So boundaries and restrictions don\u2019t work the first time\u2026keep doing it. If a 25yr old is still doing shit like this they were taught it was acceptable based on not having been taught boundaries correctly. Don\u2019t allow the oldest around unless she can act in a mature way. They are traumatizing your daughter and think it\u2019s funny.", "not allow your oldest back until she stops. she obviously gets your son into I. she's a bully and ses Turing your son into one you need to do better or you're middle child is gong to not have anything to do ith any of you. you're forcing her to interact and see her bullies. stop letting available over alone.", "Are you high? 25 is not practically a kid.", "Agreed! Abut much if it was the first time and they had no way of knowing her condition or that she was asleep; but none of that is true, this is probably not even the first straw to break the camels back but this poor girl is probably drowning in it!", "Please update your post. You are using the wrong abbreviation. BPD stands for Borderline personality disorder. That's completely different with different symptomatic. \n\nIn both cases YTA to let a known bully into your house while you are not there to protect your child.", "Bipolar people need a solid sleep routine and not to stay up late or skip sleep. So why is kendall doing thisv", "You know bpd stands for borderline, not bipolar, right? Just confirming. They are different things tho neither is easy and she should feel safe in her home no matter what.", "yelling? yes. yelling until they leave and saying its YOUR house\u2026.no.", "No \u201creminding her\u201d that wasnt the way isnt it - where is her punishment? Like you do the rest? Bipolar runs in families\u2026. \n\nIf she just gets \u201creminding\u201d then others should do too. \n\nNot just that there are key things you are not doing to help her\u2026like a set sleep schedule. \n\nwaking a sibling IS normal sibling stuff. Very very normal. \n\nDid you tell Kendall infront of Ava that she has no right kicking her out ever? that its not her house and she has as much right as another sibling? \n\nHow much do you enable Kendall vs accomodate her because the line is SUPER fine.", "I understand what you're saying but when was the last time you told off Kendall for over reacting to her siblings?", "I don't think that leaving Ava and Kendall alone together is a good idea. Ava is an adult who is bullying a child who is diagnosed with an illness. It doesn't seem safe to me to have Ava around unsupervised.", "My brothers did stuff like this to me growing up. I\u2019m bipolar. Caused so much irreparable damage that we don\u2019t speak to this day.", "I was wondering the same thing. BPD isn't something that comes out of nowhere. Who knows what older sister did to Kendall when she was younger.", "My abusive parent was the one with BPD.", "It\u2019s not that they don\u2019t understand, sometimes people just don\u2019t *want* to understand, despite the amount of resources available to them. \n\nMy oldest sister (now 35, at the time 32) insisted that DID, schizophrenia, BPD and bipolar were \u201cbasically the same thing\u201d and told me to just \u201cfigure out why your brain does this and then fix it\u201d.", "BPD is usually the result of trauma in childhood, isn't it? I wonder if Ava has bullied sis enough to actually cause the BPD in the first place.", "I\u2019d feel more for mom if I didn\u2019t think these parents have enabled the oldest in her bullying all along.", "Yes BPD is essentially childhood trauma or C-PTSD"]}
