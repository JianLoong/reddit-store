About a year ago someone reached out and told me she knew Mary and her (now 6yo) son was mine. This person hadn't known my name until meeting another friend of mine and they figured it out. Apparently Mary had started dating someone (Jon) just after we hooked up, then found out she was pregnant. Mary and Jon got serious, got married, and Jon adopted my son.\n\nAfter I found out, I got a lawyer and filed for custody in my state. Mary and Jon fought me through the whole process, telling me not to break up their family (they have a younger daughter). After lots of legal fees, I finally forced a paternity test and got every other weekend. My intent is to keep pushing until I have 50/50 custody. I looked into reversing the adoption but it is basically impossible, so I'll probably have to wait until my son is 18 and then do it with his consent.\n\nI have been having my son over for the past few months and it's been great. He gets along great with my GF too. He understands that I'm his father but of course he calls Jon dad. I'm not trying to get him to stop that because I don't want to confuse him or make him uneasy, but last weekend I did tell him that he can call me dad too instead of Mr. Lastname like his mom told him too. He seemed fine with it and called me dad while he was with me.\n\nHis mom found out and has been pestering me all week, saying I'm a sperm donor and Jon is his real dad and she'll take me to court for parental alienation. The last thing she said was that I can be an uncle but my son only has one dad.\n\nI'm ignoring most of what she said, but I am wondering if AITA for asking my son to call me dad in this situation.", "created_utc": 1696034906, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16vswwe/aita_for_teaching_my_son_to_call_me_dad_against/", "score": 369, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

About a year ago someone reached out and told me she knew Mary and her (now 6yo) son was mine. This person hadn't known my name until meeting another friend of mine and they figured it out. Apparently Mary had started dating someone (Jon) just after we hooked up, then found out she was pregnant. Mary and Jon got serious, got married, and Jon adopted my son.\n\nAfter I found out, I got a lawyer and filed for custody in my state. Mary and Jon fought me through the whole process, telling me not to break up their family (they have a younger daughter). After lots of legal fees, I finally forced a paternity test and got every other weekend. My intent is to keep pushing until I have 50/50 custody. I looked into reversing the adoption but it is basically impossible, so I'll probably have to wait until my son is 18 and then do it with his consent.\n\nI have been having my son over for the past few months and it's been great. He gets along great with my GF too. He understands that I'm his father but of course he calls Jon dad. I'm not trying to get him to stop that because I don't want to confuse him or make him uneasy, but last weekend I did tell him that he can call me dad too instead of Mr. Lastname like his mom told him too. He seemed fine with it and called me dad while he was with me.\n\nHis mom found out and has been pestering me all week, saying I'm a sperm donor and Jon is his real dad and she'll take me to court for parental alienation. The last thing she said was that I can be an uncle but my son only has one dad.\n\nI'm ignoring most of what she said, but I am wondering if AITA for asking my son to call me dad in this situation.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He would\u2019ve if he had known about the kid. \n\nThe only asshole here is Mary for lying and hiding to both OP and her son. She\u2019s an awful parent for lying.", "Oh so it's ok to steal kids now that's called kidnapping.  She should face charges for what she did", "No, it\u2019s his son. He didn\u2019t abandon the kid, he didn\u2019t know that he existed.", "I\u2019m not saying that the man taking care of the kid his whole life isn\u2019t a dad to him, just that OP deserves the chance to show up for his kid. And I feel like the kid deserves to know his bio dad. Especially as a kid who is adopted is gonna find out eventually and feel like his bio dad threw him away even tho that\u2019s not what happened. OP is trying to step up and be the dad he was supposed to be.", "Again, OP knew he finished inside of Mary. He\u2019s just as shitty for not keeping contact. Who\u2019s to say Mary just randomly ran out after sex and went out of her way to conceal the pregnancy? For all we know OP could of dodged the calls.", "That doesn\u2019t make him ah that he let HIS son know that could call him dad. Unlike the mom who openly telling her child what to call op.", "\"\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9! Lawyer up!\"", "Good luck with that.", "I want to reply to this based on your post history but it\u2019s not nice so I\u2019m going to keep it to myself but just know it\u2019s there", "It's not your choice to make, though. Allowed? Lol.", "Why so defensive?  Trying to hide something? I put a hypothetical and now you act like I am accusing him. I put INFO for a reason because I don't fuck girls without considering murphy's law.", "Spot on! The poster who assumed it was raped has posts saying he has trouble even approaching women. I WONDER WHY.", "The kid is 6 years old and has a right to know who his real father is, he can call Jon papa but the real father shouldn't compromise", "In hindsight, she probably should have aborted OP's son.", "What they actually meant is \"Dads\" aren't entitled to their children. The uproar they would kick if he took the baby and kept it from her would be enough that the cops would go and take it back to her, likely.", "I guess it's true when they say great minds think alike hahaha", "The adoption of the son by Jon is the critical piece.  At that point, Jon is the father and the OP no longer has any obligations.  After 6 years, leave the kid alone.", "You are completely right", "He is teaching his son to call him dad, there's a difference. All this kid knows is that Jon is his dad, then some dude shows up six years later to be like, \"Hey! I'm your dad, too!\"   \nOP had a one night stand, had unprotected sex (or poorly protected sex) and then never once tried to track this woman down again. He went to a party and met her. Finding out her name would've taken a little time and effort by asking the hosts and others he may have known who were also there. He apparently didn't put a whole lot of effort into finding out who this person was or how they were until 6 years later. There was no moral imperative until he found out that there was a kid involved, and dumping that on a six year old is pretty heavy.   \nI'm gonna give the benefit of the doubt and say it's selfishness.", "YTA, your reddit history proves it.", "John is just as much a real father: he adopted the kid and has been his parent since birth. They can both be dads, but John isn\u2019t a fake dad.", "So women can do whatever they want force you into having a child if you don't want it and make you pay child support or just steal the child and it's all ok.", "So if someone kidnapped a kid and holds him for 6 years does it mean his biological parents loose their right as his parents? And does it mean that the kidnappers become his family??", "If Mary hadn\u2019t been a selfish asshole OP would\u2019ve gotten to have his son and KNOW about him.\n\nThe only one to blame here is Mary for being a bad mom. The good news is the son found out now instead of going NC with Mary at 18 when he would find out the truth. Most kids want to know why a parent \u201cdidn\u2019t want them\u201d. And boy would Mary be in trouble when son found out real dad didn\u2019t know and wanted him. \n\nOP isn\u2019t an asshole for wanting to be in his sons life. Mary is for lying to the kid.", "No he not teaching him. He told him he can call him dad too. Not hey you need to call me dad. \n\nWhy would he track down a one night stand?  He didn\u2019t need to inform her of test results. He had no clue she was pregnant. You are acting like its his fault for not keeping in touch with a one night stand. Who the mom also chose to have. \n\nIf the mom had op involved since the beginning then it would have never been a problem. She literally fought op to not be involved in his kid life at all. That was being selfish. The child has every right to know their biological parents unless it would cause harm to the child.", "YTA, your reddit post proves it. You are a creepy fuck going into my history.", "That is an entirely different scenario and not applicable.", "OP hit it and quit it, so don't sit there and pretend he's blameless. They'd never met before, and OP never tried to contact her again, until he found out that she had a kid.  \nMary may have tried to find OP, but there's no proof for that or against it.   \nYou have zero evidence that the son would've gone no contact with mom at 18. That's pure speculation.  \nAnd I never said the OP was an asshole for wanting to be in the kid's life. What I did say was that OP was TA for teaching the kid to call him dad, especially at 6 years old.", ">Why would he track down a one night stand?\n\nUh. Maybe to find out of she was pregnant? \n\n>She literally fought op to not be involved in his kid life at all\n\nYeah. *Six years* after the fact. He had zero interest in finding out of she'd gotten pregnant.", "Going into history is a critical part of reddit.  It was designed that way so people could check.  Some of my history I cringe; but having it searchable is to keep people like you from being assholes all the time because of the consequences. \n\nYou are just butt hurt you got called out for your asshole behavior that is well documented.", "It's not...the same as father can't take away a child from his mother the same mother can't take away his son...that's kidnapping...one night stand two night stand no stand at all it doesn't matter...they both begin involved in the making of the kid they both responsible for him...even if the mother doesn't want it ...he is the father and have the same rights to him as her", "Its on the person who pregnant to inform the biological father.", "It is not kidnapping when a relation is not established.  Attempting to make this the same as a long term relationship or an established patent is ridiculous.  A lack of contact is grounds for terminating parental rights.", "If she can find him. And no, it's not just on her. It's also on him to find out. He's an adult.   \nShe obviously has no interest in contacting him for whatever reason.  \nHe had no interest in contacting her for whatever reason.", "It was kidnapping by Mary. She withheld from son\u2019s biological father and never gave her a chance. \n\nParents can kidnap their children and that\u2019s what Mary did to OP. She\u2019s the only asshole here and now she has to pay for her lies.", "Disagree...he didn't choose the lack of contact..it was forced on him by her lies and when he learned about his kid he should have the same rights that she have", "Welp make sure you send a review card to everyone you sleep with."]}
