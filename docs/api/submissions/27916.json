About a year ago someone reached out and told me she knew Mary and her (now 6yo) son was mine. This person hadn't known my name until meeting another friend of mine and they figured it out. Apparently Mary had started dating someone (Jon) just after we hooked up, then found out she was pregnant. Mary and Jon got serious, got married, and Jon adopted my son.\n\nAfter I found out, I got a lawyer and filed for custody in my state. Mary and Jon fought me through the whole process, telling me not to break up their family (they have a younger daughter). After lots of legal fees, I finally forced a paternity test and got every other weekend. My intent is to keep pushing until I have 50/50 custody. I looked into reversing the adoption but it is basically impossible, so I'll probably have to wait until my son is 18 and then do it with his consent.\n\nI have been having my son over for the past few months and it's been great. He gets along great with my GF too. He understands that I'm his father but of course he calls Jon dad. I'm not trying to get him to stop that because I don't want to confuse him or make him uneasy, but last weekend I did tell him that he can call me dad too instead of Mr. Lastname like his mom told him too. He seemed fine with it and called me dad while he was with me.\n\nHis mom found out and has been pestering me all week, saying I'm a sperm donor and Jon is his real dad and she'll take me to court for parental alienation. The last thing she said was that I can be an uncle but my son only has one dad.\n\nI'm ignoring most of what she said, but I am wondering if AITA for asking my son to call me dad in this situation.\n\nEDIT: some people are asking how I could gain parental rights adoption. [It is possible](https://www.findlaw.com/family/adoption/adoption-without-parental-consent.html) because I did not consent to the adoption and Mary claimed she did not know the father. The birth certificate was blank for father. Jon decided to adopt when my son was 1 year old and he got married to Mary.", "created_utc": 1696034906, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16vswwe/aita_for_teaching_my_son_to_call_me_dad_against/", "score": 3952, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

About a year ago someone reached out and told me she knew Mary and her (now 6yo) son was mine. This person hadn't known my name until meeting another friend of mine and they figured it out. Apparently Mary had started dating someone (Jon) just after we hooked up, then found out she was pregnant. Mary and Jon got serious, got married, and Jon adopted my son.\n\nAfter I found out, I got a lawyer and filed for custody in my state. Mary and Jon fought me through the whole process, telling me not to break up their family (they have a younger daughter). After lots of legal fees, I finally forced a paternity test and got every other weekend. My intent is to keep pushing until I have 50/50 custody. I looked into reversing the adoption but it is basically impossible, so I'll probably have to wait until my son is 18 and then do it with his consent.\n\nI have been having my son over for the past few months and it's been great. He gets along great with my GF too. He understands that I'm his father but of course he calls Jon dad. I'm not trying to get him to stop that because I don't want to confuse him or make him uneasy, but last weekend I did tell him that he can call me dad too instead of Mr. Lastname like his mom told him too. He seemed fine with it and called me dad while he was with me.\n\nHis mom found out and has been pestering me all week, saying I'm a sperm donor and Jon is his real dad and she'll take me to court for parental alienation. The last thing she said was that I can be an uncle but my son only has one dad.\n\nI'm ignoring most of what she said, but I am wondering if AITA for asking my son to call me dad in this situation.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You want to be regarded as a father? Act like one. Stop pressing him and his parents, be there when he wants/needs not forcefully there because it\u2019s court mandated. \n\nI didn\u2019t know my biological father until I was 12. I knew I wasn\u2019t my dads biologically when I was 7, I was told by my grandparents vindictively to hurt my parents and in return I have some lasting issues with it. One thing I can say about my bio father is that he didn\u2019t push. He knew he was coming into a pre-established family unit and didn\u2019t make me feel like I was picking sides, I still to this day refer to him as his first name because that\u2019s what I\u2019m comfortable with. Obviously the setup in my case is a little different than your sons but take it from a person who has a bio father AND a dad, the absolute best you can do for him is let him define the relationship you two share instead of forcing yourself and your ideals onto him and making your comfort something he has to pay for.", "NTA take her to court for parental alienation..", "NTA for wanting to be an asshole but I do have a question.

All of this could have been avoided if she had told you and not assumed you were the kind of person who wouldn't want to be involved in his child's life.  \n\nBut maybe she should be given the benefit of the doubt.  Did she know enough about you, (like your full name and mutual friends) that she would have been able to track you down to let you know?\n\nYour son should call you Dad if he is comfortable calling you Dad.  It's biologically who you are, and hopefully, what you will become to him.  Since it is so early in your relationship, maybe you should have said, you can call me \"Dave\" (whatever your first name is) or Dad or whatever you feel like.  \n\nThis is such a messy situation and so confusing for this little guy.  I am sure his sense of security has been rocked to its core.  Did your son know his adopted Dad isn't his bio Dad?

Just like when a man has sex with a woman he's got to be prepared to potentially become a father and share a child with that woman, when a woman has sex with a man she has to accept the same possibility--that this man she's sleeping with could be her future child's dad. It's not only HER child. She didn't even give him a chance to be a father to his own son.\n\nThat's why people need to think long and clearly before they have sex with ANYONE (unless you're a woman who is ok with abortion --too bad if you're the man and you want to terminate and she doesn't--and you keep a close eye on your cycle so you can catch it in time, can afford the procedure and the time off from work to get it, and live in a part of the world where it's safe and legal--which in itself is becoming more difficult in the US). It's more than the fact that you could become a parent before you're ready. It's more than the fact that you could be tied to that person you created a child with for the rest of your life. The biggest issue is that you may end up watching that person parent YOUR child in a way that breaks your heart. You love your kid and want the best for them, but there's nothing you can do to alter who their other parent is. \n\nThis is not the case with OP; he's a stand-up dad and it sounds like he thinks his son's mom and her husband are doing a good job parenting him other than keeping him a secret from OP, but I've seen so many people lamenting their child's other parent's existence. It's usually a woman with a deadbeat ex, but I've also known men who had a kid with a woman who is a crappy mom and makes life very hard for both the dad and their kid. One of my cousins had a baby with a man who had three other kids with three other women. He doesn't support any of them, he doesn't \"parent\" any of them, he just shows up at their birthday parties and the occasional get-together, brings gifts (which apparently he talks his mom into paying for), and plays the \"fun dad.\" He manipulates all the women (including his own mom) into covering for him and making excuses for him so as not to hurt the kids. He knows that those baby mamas are never going to say \"your dad is a piece of shit and he doesn't love you\" so he gets away with this. Those kids will probably realize it someday, but based on some of the stories I read here, he may very well still guilt trip them into housing him and changing his Depends when he's too old to philander anymore.\n\nMy cousin KNEW all this and she still had sex with him repeatedly, supposedly with protection, but throwing on a condom at the last minute \"most of the time\" does not count as adequate protection in my mind.

Women don't have to register anything, and men can't look up women's pregnancies or anything. \n\nThat's how it works in most states, but this is a state-by-state thing.", "The men can't keep tabs on the women. It's so the state can contact the man if the woman chooses to place a child for adoption.", "[From here](https://www.hg.org/legal-articles/birth-father-legal-rights-when-child-adopted-out-by-birth-mother-48576)\n\n> When the biological father is not violent, he usually has some rights to acquire custody or to have involvement in the life of the child. This is even sometimes possible after adoption, and hiring a lawyer is important to protect his rights.", "Mary\u2019s friend was also at the party and remembers the face of her friend\u2019s hook-up from a specific party six years ago. \n\nHappens to become friends with someone who is also friends with OP and starts talking about a party from six years ago and just reveals her friend got knocked up by a stranger at said party?\n\nNew friend shows her a picture of OP and says \u201cmy friend fucked Mary.\u201d Mary\u2019s friend is so certain that it\u2019s him, that she tells him, presumably without Mary\u2019s approval or confirmation. \n\nCome on.", "Thats what \u201cfiling for custody\u201d means.", "What do you recommend for parents who divorce if you don\u2019t agree with 50/50?", "Apologies, still seems to come across as aggressively inserting himself instead of slowing growing into his son's life", "That\u2019s not what happened here, running off with someone\u2019s kids is a lot different to not trying to find the one night stand that knocked you up", "50/50 custody in a different state is a lot more than \u201csome time\u201d", "Not \u201csome time\u201d. 50/50.", "What makes it sound that way? Because he wants to spend time with his biological child?", "He said the birth certificate said father unknown.", "It is this completely \n\nAs well as throwing a lot of money at solicitors. \n\nI can\u2019t see any of this being in the child\u2019s best interest at 6 years old", "This is not true if the mother legally attests that she doesn't know who the father is.", "I think people are ignoring this? Like OP says it was mutual connections who pointed it out. People at the party those years are are more than likely to have known the two fucked. Even my own friend group is aware when someone within it fools around.", "One parent gets the kid and the other has visitation for holidays or other times so it\u2019s not one week here one week there back and forth.", "OP has to be aggressive or else he would never have any relationship with his son.", "And you recommend he trust the woman that lied to him for 6 years? He has no alternative.", "Not the person you were replying to, but the part that made me very suspect of OP is the part where he talks about wanting to reverse the adoption and that he will wait until the kid is 18 and try to do it then.  He doesn\u2019t just want to be a parent to his son, he wants to tear away the guy that has been there for that kid.  And how he is pushing to have the kid see him as a father after just a few months.  The kid is six, this has to be confusing and difficult for him.  I\u2019m not seeing a whole lot of concern for the best interests of this kid here.  What I see is OP being mainly concerned with what he wants.", "OP says that after he found out he got a lawyer and filed for custody, with the aim of getting 50/50. \n\nWhat about \u201cI reached out and tried to build a relationship, but when that failed I had no option but to hire a lawyer etc.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s none of that, just a demand to own half the child as if he were an object or an asset.\n\nPushing for 50/50 is clearly ridiculous. A little kid should not be doing a week on and off with a different family he\u2019s only just met, that is not in any kid\u2019s interests really, especially as OP says he got a lawyer in his state, implying the child\u2019s family live in a different state.", "Because this is aita and woman=victim, and if it isn't obvious then we can invent the missing reasons and motivations", "Hey, nut case, how about you give it a rest? You\u2019re obviously wrong. He has visitation rights.", "I mean, yeah. He was lied to and didn\u2019t know about this kid. He couldn\u2019t be there for him. But it\u2019s not fair to have an adoption where he didn\u2019t give consent, as he was legally entitled to do. If I found out there was a child out there that was somehow mine and I didn\u2019t know it and that some other woman adopted that child as the mom????? I would be doing everything that I can to overturn that adoption. \n\nIt is not suspicious. That is the OP\u2019s SON.\n\nAnd reversing the adoption wouldn\u2019t change the other dude\u2019s presence in the kids life.", "Uhhh hiring a lawyer and suing for custody is the right thing to do in any matter. It\u2019s not controlling, he did the right thing. Wtf?????? Like literally, it is the only advice that should be given to parents who are not together but need to share custody. Get an agreement that is enforceable through the court. Present your evidence and let the court decide custody. \n\nIf the kid grows up and finds out his bio dad knew about him and didn\u2019t reach out or fight for him, he will be severely impacted - that\u2019s a lot of emotional damage. The Op is doing the right thing.", "Yeah like in this post there's nothing about doing this because his son wanted it; what if son is cool seeing him every now and then but isn't interested in a second dad he has to visit 50% of the time?\n\nI don't get some of these responses either. OP claims it was a one night stand and he didn't know who the woman was; if that's true it's probably also the case she didn't know him so when she became pregnant, how was she supposed to tell him? All these people talking about fraud and deceit and having his child stolen from him, I don't get this at all. Don't have one night stands if you want to raise a child with someone.\n\nIdk, something is off about this", "I just don\u2019t understand why make assumptions in one way from a post that has zero information. I get it - I don\u2019t want to share my kids, I want them full time\u2026but if I get divorced, I know I have to do 50/50. I can imagine going to court and being like \u201cno no, judge, their biological father doesn\u2019t NEED TO be in their lives, I found a new step daddy for them\u201d", "He does not \u201cneed\u201d to share custody of a 6 year old child he\u2019s only just met for any reason other than his own ego", "The child is already being severely impacted.\n\nAnd how old were they at the party and how drunk was she?\n\nIt matters.", "Uhhh what? So dads don\u2019t need to be parents to their kids???? What is this insanity.", "Why assume it the worst way when you have zero facts? And even so, what ISN\u2019T dispositive is that he\u2019s controlling because he did what he was supposed to do: retain an attorney, establish paternity through legal means, and go through the court for custody. Ffs.", "OP only just met the kid; absolutely he shouldnt be going 0-full time father so quickly. He should be trying to keep this boy's life as stable as possible"]}
