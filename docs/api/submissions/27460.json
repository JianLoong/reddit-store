What \u201cprinciples\u201d does that even go against?", "NTA People like your SIL are competitive narcissists.

She's not doing any harm, she just clearly feels like she has to compete (no clue why) but that's her choice. Why get involved?", "YTA, your SIL is probably just feels prompted to participate and share when your sister does.

It could HONESTLY be that when the niece gets a mention she innocently goes, oh yeah (news/new photo of nephew). You, an unaffected 3rd party, are the one making this out to be some competition.

People like her are the absolute worst. You caught a fish, they caught a whale. Your kid is reading, their kid is a prodigy. It\u2019s the game of one upmanship that she has started already. She believes her son is superior to your niece. Good on your for saying something. \n\nShe sounds annoying and exhausting.", "Say you don't like your brother's wife without saying you don't like your brother's wife.", "I understand why you are doing it. I don't think it is an AH move to point it out except that you did it publicly. You should have brought it up with either your brother or SIL privately. I agree, there are some people who refuse to let others shine.", "YTA she\u2019s got a kid. It\u2019s literally her whole world right now. If you love them then what\u2019s the problem? It doesn\u2019t hurt you at all to just look past it. You don\u2019t get to control what she says or posts. Apologize and back off", "YTA Your sister is an adult and the competing photos involves her child and SIL\u2019s son. While it\u2019s fine for you to feel like you to it\u2019s not your business. Instead of leaving it to your sister to deal with y\u2019alls SIL (and if she wants to ignore it that\u2019s her choice) you decided to confront SIL in the family group chat (thus involving everyone in your drama stirring) instead of having a private chat or taking SIL out for coffee to talk privately since you had to have your say. Again, it\u2019s your sister\u2019s choice how to deal with this or ignore it.", "I did delete after a few seconds because I released I couldn\u2019t be bothered but I do think your approach would of been better", "It doesn\u2019t go against my principles it\u2019s the principle of her doing it like she can\u2019t let my niece have the stop light she\u2019s got to make it about her son and herself \n\nIt\u2019s not right she shouldn\u2019t be doing it, \n\nLike if she send pictures great but why does it have to be every time there\u2019s one of my niece first?", "Thanks today for example my niece has had her hair done for a wedding where she will be a flower girl then my sister in law just sends normal photo of my nephew\n\nI took my niece to a younger kids theme park she got to meet bluey, then what do you know pictures of my nephew \n\nI don\u2019t get why she just can\u2019t allow it \nWait a day or something not instantly respond with pictures of my nephew \n\nHonestly as well I love them both equal I\u2019m natural so it\u2019s not I\u2019m bias to if it my my child", "What even is your comment? I haven\u2019t stirred anything up\n\nI don\u2019t like I told her that\u2019s it", "Because she\u2019s been doing it for two years and I don\u2019t understand why she has to, I think it\u2019s unnecessary also I did delete my comment instantly but it must it was clearly to late", "I just said that she doesn\u2019t need to send a photo of my nephew every time someone posts one of my niece", "Because I feel like she doesn\u2019t need to change the focus the way from my niece, honestly if my sister did the same every time I\u2019d be saying the same \n\nI do get it\u2019s not a massive deal though", "It hasn\u2019t no only between me and her it\u2019s hasn\u2019t caused anything between the others \nAlso my sister has told me loads of times she doesn\u2019t like when she\u2019s does it", "Also say you were at a wedding and shared someone photos or were on holiday and every time you sent a photo of yourself someone just replied with photos of themselves you just wouldn\u2019t do that", "My sister and her partner have to me yes like my sister has rang me a few times and text when she does\n\nThey would never say any thing though \n\nAlso people need to remember it\u2019s been two years it\u2019s not like it\u2019s happened once I\u2019ve said something", "I do spend time with my nephew as well, I love spending time with him", "I have spoken to my brother about it before \n\nBut I agree it wasn\u2019t the best idea to do it publicly \nI didn\u2019t delete less than 30 second but it was to late", "That\u2019s not true at all my sister doesn\u2019t compete today for example she sent them because my niece has has her done for a wedding coming up where she is the flower girl \n\nAnd the photo of my nephew are just him outside doing nothing special \n\nAlso when my SlA send photos first my sister doesn\u2019t send any after", "Why is this such a big problem for you? I can see how it would be mildly annoying maybe. A lot of parents do that though \u201cOh you\u2019re kid is cute, here\u2019s a picture of my kid\u201d\u2026 you took something totally harmless and started drama over it so YTA.", "She\u2019s the type of person when your niece is older and starts making achievements she will say that\u2019s nice but my son did this", "I see .... well that wasn\u2019t necessary & you have zero control over other people. Just don\u2019t react or respond to to her pictures. Maybe she will get the hint.\n\nI can\u2019t tell if this is about you or these kids. Seems like the kids don\u2019t care so why do you? Would you feel differently if your brother was the person sending the pics? \n\nThere are no principles in sharing photos with family. One person sends a pic of kids, dogs, food, everyone responds (in my experience) .... You\u2019re all one family & you can enjoy multiple pictures. Maybe SIL is just trying to participate or maybe she thinks everyone likes niece more? \n\nNAH \n\nEdit judgment. I think no one is the ah... everyone just showing what they are doing at the moment.", "I get that but honestly, the only ones that will allow her to take the attention away from your niece, are the ones diverting their attention to you nephew. It's a bit strange what she's doing but no point starting a family war over it, it's not that deep. And plus, you could have pulled her aside and had a chat privately, rather than pull her up on the group chat", "Depending on how you approached her, I'm leaning ESH. Her for pretty blatantly trying to upstage people (assuming the worst. That's another thing because maybe she just thought it would be nice to send pictures of her child too. I personally wouldn't be mad at pictures of both my niece and nephew but, this is me taking her actions in good faith here). However, and this is obviously my personal opinion, I don't see it as that big of a deal tbh.", "Don't worry about it. She needed to be told and from the little information I have to go on and knowing the type publicly calling her out was the most effective means.", "I have kids, and I don't do this when friends, family, or co-workers show pictures of their kids. If they ask, sure, I'll show them. I get where OP is coming from. My family did this to me (with their animals) so I just stopped. It's annoying to try to show a life event but then get shat on with an uncalled for picture just because I showed a picture.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s harmless when it\u2019s 2 years of the same behaviour \n\nWhy can\u2019t she just allow it, when she post a picture first no else will do that", "The kids are 3 and 2 and have no idea \nAlso I wouldn\u2019t want them involved as it\u2019s not them it\u2019s her \n\nNo I would feel differently at all and if my sister did the same to them I\u2019d be telling her the only difference I\u2019d probably just say to her face that she doesn\u2019t need to do that \n\nI think she thinks that about me, \nFor added context me and my brother live up north so have travel quite far to see my niece and I do post when I go down however I\u2019m not allowed to post about my nephew her rules she doesn\u2019t want him on socials baring her own", "Well I\u2019m not has my sister has spoken about it to me \nBut the rules say I can\u2019t speak for other people so I didn\u2019t mention it in op", "I get it\u2019s not a big deal, I\u2019m not mad about seeing a picture of my nephew I like seeing them, it\u2019s just it\u2019s like she can\u2019t let it be about my niece it\u2019s got it be about her son (her) \nIt\u2019s her the problem not my niece he\u2019s a cool little dude and I love him", "I like how you\u2019re still trying to justify yourself. Who is it harming and how?", "Well not for nothing... you probably should have talked to your brother or SIL to their face instead of calling her out on a group chat.\n\nSeems like this may be about something else. Regardless, sounds like an adult issue but really it\u2019s meant to be about the kids. Kids can never have too many people showing they love & care about them.", "I hear you. Makes sense but again, you could have had a private chat, rather than on the group. People get more defensive when theres others around.", "Well it bothers my sister a little, it\u2019s not harm but it is annoying and unnecessary", "Also all I did was was point out she does it and say she doesn\u2019t need to then I deleted it after about 10 seconds", "Yeah for sure it\u2019s an adult issue not the kids posing I have mentioned it to my brother a couple of times \n\nBut I do get where you\u2019re coming from", "I agree with that, ther approach would of been better", "You deleted it, but you still said it and she still saw it, so that doesn't matter.\n\nIf it hurt your siblings, they could have said something. They didn't care enough to say something, so you shouldn't have said anything either.", "Maybe y\u2019all can turn it in to a drinking game or place bets on it. Turn it to something funny instead of just something annoying. \n\nMaybe tell your brother every time she does that he owes $1 to a group fund .... keep posting pics & you will have enough for a vacation in no time! \n\nGood luck!", "The deed is done now, can't change the facts. Maybe going forward, have another 'private' chat with her and see if you can clear the air"]}
