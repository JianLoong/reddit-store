People get more defensive when theres others around.", "Well it bothers my sister a little, it\u2019s not harm but it is annoying and unnecessary", "Also all I did was was point out she does it and say she doesn\u2019t need to then I deleted it after about 10 seconds", "Yeah for sure it\u2019s an adult issue not the kids posing I have mentioned it to my brother a couple of times \n\nBut I do get where you\u2019re coming from", "I agree with that, ther approach would of been better", "You deleted it, but you still said it and she still saw it, so that doesn't matter.\n\nIf it hurt your siblings, they could have said something. They didn't care enough to say something, so you shouldn't have said anything either.", "Maybe y\u2019all can turn it in to a drinking game or place bets on it.

Lol\n\nIt sounds like you really love your family and they\u2019re clearly important to you.  I think that you know that your heart was probably in the right place when you confronted her, but you didn\u2019t consider how offensive you came across with your accusation towards your sister in law. \n\nIt is only reasonable that your would sister-in-law would  have a reaction to you calling her out and she\u2019s probably embarrassed. Go figure. She doesn\u2019t enjoy being judged.  \n\nyou\u2019re assuming a lot about your own worthiness when you openly criticize someone\u2019s actions based on your guess about their hidden motivations or bad intentions. \nJust because we believe something is true does not mean it is wise to say.

This isn't like you posted it on Facebook as its own post or as a comment on her own post.

I just was baffled.\n\nIt took me a while but I got there lol", "YTA yeah. Annoying? For sure. What was to be gained from calling her out? Just give the pic a quick cursory \u201cAw nice\u201d and then direct the conversation back to niece\n\nMaybe she worries about being the most distant from you all. Maybe she worries her son will be forgotten in favor of niece because they live in the south.  \n\nDoesn\u2019t make her behavior ok but you chose to assume negative intent. And then instead of tactfully reaching out in person or privately you had to leave a seriously sarcastic and cutting message. \n\nFamilies come with minor annoyances. When it\u2019s this minor you find tactful ways to deal.", "NTA", "I\u2019d like an update after the next time niece is posted on if she does it again or if this shames her enough to stop lol", "If you deleted the message 30 seconds after you sent it, then you already know who the Asshole is.", "YTA Although I agree that she\u2019s being annoying by doing that, it\u2019s kind of messed up to call her out publicly. Also who is it really hurting? You get pics of both kids so if anything it\u2019s a win win. I don\u2019t have kids and only one niece and it\u2019s the only kid I enjoy getting photos of but I wouldn\u2019t mind getting pics of both kids if I had a niece or nephew, even SIL\u2019s reasons aren\u2019t the best. \n\nAdvice for your life, save the drama for something that really matters one day. You just disturbed your family\u2019s peace over a non issue.", "Definitely* ftfy", "My first thought was, since it's a group chat, once she sees a pic of one kid she's reminded to send one of her own. I occasionally do the same thing lol I never instigate sending pics of my kids because I never think about it.\n\nI'm curious if she ever sends pics of nephew independently or if it's always the cause/effect OP noticed.", "Yeah this \"don't rock the boat\" mentality in regards to SIL's bs behavior isn't going to cause harm to niece when she gets older at all /s\n\nIt's interesting how children aren't considered people.", "Okay sorry I just just pointed out she does it and said does she need to do that \nI also deleted 30 seconds after saying it as after thinking I didn\u2019t want the drama but I was to late", "I feel your missing the point completely and reducing it\u2019s it basic level", "How am I an unaffected 3rd party? I care bout my niece, nephew brother and sister \n\nHow do you know it\u2019s an assumption\n\nAs I said she\u2019s done it every time with out fail for to years", "Please elaborate", "Well I won\u2019t be swore at so I reacted in the heat of the moment \n\nWe aren\u2019t prefect are we", "Hahah I didn\u2019t want to use names sorry for any confusion", "It\u2019s all gone mad my brother kicked her off the group then left himself so it\u2019s not gonna happen again", "Do you often take your niece to do such fun things and not your nephew?", "She does to be fair but when she does we just like it and comment how cute and just be nice \n\nNo else does immediately let\u2019s make it about me", "lol FFS the niece isn\u2019t privy to this and if this is the extent of such behavior, you leave it. You all roll your eyes, give a cursory \u201cnice\u201d to the pic, and then everyone continues to gush over the niece pic.", "Then perhaps an apology for your lack of sensitivity could be in order.  Then explain that while you love those kids equally, that her continual upstaging can really be hurtful and to perhaps refrain a bit.  Or...tell the other sibling to upstage her and give her a taste of her own medicine+  haha", "So you are aware you started drama lol it\u2019s fine OP she\u2019s an AH and then instead of finding a sensitive or tactful way to mention it you chose to also be an AH. \n\nYou took her to task for a minor annoyance. \n\nWhy can\u2019t everyone just pointedly redirect the conversation to niece? \n\nAnd hey maybe she\u2019s not 1-upping. You said they live farthest away so you all see niece more often. Perhaps she\u2019s trying to advocate and stay involved and is going about it poorly. These are all things you could have provided reassurance about and had a lovely kind conversation about in private and in person.", "right but what did you say specifically? imo thats the biggest factor whether or not you were actually the AH here. did you say something like \"hey (SIL) is it necessary to post a picture of your kid everytime someone else does?\" or was it more \"oh my god (SIL) enough with your kid already!\"", "I feel like you\u2019re making a big deal out of something that should have constituted an eye roll.", "Not really. You\u2019ve taken a minor annoyance and instead of pointedly managing it without \u201ccalling her out\u201d (just redirect the conversation) you had to make a scene. Now you wonder if you\u2019re TA. Yeah, a bit. \n\nFamilies come with minor annoyances. It\u2019s a given. Unless this is escalating or harming others, you needed to let it go, or make a comment in person that was actually tactful. \n\nAnyone saying N T A is missing that. \n\nKeeping the peace doesn\u2019t mean excusing toxic or harmful behavior. It means letting the minor stuff like this go.\n\nSo at its simplest level: \n\nThis is a minor issue and you had to make it a significant one. You didn\u2019t have to.", "First off.
