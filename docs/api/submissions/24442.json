So to give some context my father is 81, lives with my sister states away, and is having surgery on his eyes.  Apparently his surgery got moved up unexpectedly and my sister and her husband already had a trip booked overseas during that time so they asked me to fly from VA to OH to watch my dad for 5 days.  She said they would pay for everything, including a ride to/from the airport.  They said the fridge would be stocked and everything would be taken care of.  So I agreed, it is a huge pain but it is my dad, and canceling a vacation sucks.  So when she\u2019s booking the flights, she shows me leaving at 5am to go there and getting back home after midnight.  I have work in the morning so I asked can she please book me an earlier flight so I\u2019m not drained at work the next day.  I think that was a reasonable request.  She huffs and puffs and says it\u2019ll cost $200 more for a more reasonable time.  She is now asking me for money to help with the flight.  I refused.  I am 100% on commission so missing anytime is costing me money. I\u2019m also not going to pay money to be crazily inconvenienced.  Some more context, my sister is also a travel agent so I\u2019m positive she has trip insurance or something like that.  Am I the asshole for holding my ground, not paying the extra money for a flight I don\u2019t wanna be on in the first place?\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for the comments, To add some more context my dad just moved with her for the surgery only, it\u2019s not a long term care situation.  The surgery is the whole reason he is there.  I don\u2019t understand why she would book a vacation before the surgery while he was still there.  I also take care of my mother locally as well.

This sounds mostly like a communication issue- she assumed you'd be cool with a redeye and budgeted for that, but it's entirely reasonable for that not to work for you.  \n\nI also really doubt any sort of \"insurance\" would cover what you want to happen- redeye flights are less expensive precisely because they're inconvenient, and the airline isn't going to charge less than they can just because your sister is a travel agent.\n\nI think it's not unreasonable for you to make your sister eat the cost of the flight, but I get her being grumpy about it.", "~~YTA, I am going with the crowd this time.~~\n\nNTA based on the edit.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
