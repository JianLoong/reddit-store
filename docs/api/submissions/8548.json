This story mainly involves my roommate Lucy (F24).\n\nLucy is unemployed and doesn't have any major commitments, her parents fund everything she needs. She's convinced one day she's going to go viral on tiktok or youtube and be a star. She spends most of her time at the home.\n\nOne thing you need to understand about Lucy is she spends an excessive amount of time in the kitchen cooking and videoing it. She wants to go viral for her recipes, basically. Lucy doesn't eat most of the stuff she cooks and just throws it in the trash. She also makes a great deal of mess cooking and doesn't clean it up for days or even weeks.\n\nThis has only been going on for around two months so I think it might be a phase, who knows. I just wanna emphasise how much time Lucy spends cooking, she's probably in the kitchen for maybe like 7 hours everyday cooking. Me and my other roommate have asked her many times to tone it down as we often can't use the stove or oven because she's using them all but she tells us to wait until she's finished.\n\nShe has shit tons of her own special kitchen appliances (blender, food processor, rice cooker, air fryer, etc). They are never put away and always lying around on the furniture or on the counters. We don't have a lot of counter space so this is really annoying.\n\nLucy also has an omelette maker. A month ago, she used it for a video and cooked eggs with it and never washed it or anything and there's loads of egg still stuck to it.\n\nIt has started to really stink. I've asked Lucy nicely three times over the past month to clean it and put it away before it grows its own ecosystem. She says she will but never gets to it and always has an excuse like she just forgot or she's already done lots of dishwashing and she's too tired.\n\nI got fed up after it being like this for a whole month and I threw the whole omelette maker in the trash outside. Lucy is obviously royally pissed off and told me I'm bullying her and acting like a disgusting human being, and that the omelette maker wasn't hurting anyone. \n\nI told her it fucking stinks of rotten eggs (literally) and I got tired of smelling it in the kitchen. She said I'm being dramatic and overreacted and used it as an excuse to be horrible.", "created_utc": 1674936644, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10no992/aita_for_throwing_my_roommates_omelette_maker_in/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Make her go viral *Cheshire cat grin*\n\nHad a relationship with an extremely messy gf. When things got out of hand, I'd put all the clothes and things she threw around in a trash bag and leave it somewhere where she can go through and figure out later. \n\nIt always bothered her that I did that by using a trash bag, but again, as I said to her, \"to me, after a while, it all looks like unwanted, discarded items. So I do what I usually do with discarded, unwanted items. The last step is bringing them to a donation spot, which I won't.\" \n\nShe never really got rid of the habit, but the place looked nicer with less stuff thrown around and just a random trash bag always lying in a corner somewhere lol.\n\nAlso, that kind of lifestyle was part of the reason we broke up. So don't expect your roommate to change either.", "You asked her several times. She had a month to do something about it. I would not be able to eat in a kitchen that smells horrible.\n\nNTA.", "If you throw something out then you need to pay for a new one.\n\nWhat you should have done is picked it up and put it in her room.\n\nSet up a rule now that anything left more than 24 hrs unwashed has to go in that persons room.\n\nAlso start looking for somewhere else to live. She's a nightmare", "NTA. \n\nWhen you need to use the kitchen, just start using the kitchen. \n\nGet a plastic tub (like a storage thing) and when Lucy leaves her shit out, just throw it in there, out of the way, and put the lid on if it stinks. Tell your other roommate to do the same thing. \n\nIf you come in and she has made a mess, slide it on over or in to the tub, take pictures for when she says you are \"bullying\" her and tell her you can start posting these on your tik tok and will likely go viral for a \"horrid roommate story\" (I love those) so she can either start being a decent human being or all her shit can rot in a bin.", "Info: Did y'all sign a roommate agreement? Where are your RAs?", "I was definitely thinking you\u2019re the AH at first, but NTA.\nThat\u2019s filthy and disgusting. She\u2019s creating a toxic mess that is extremely unhygienic and a breeding ground for diseases like salmonella. And being extremely inconsiderate of your space.\n\nI\u2019d usually say it\u2019s never okay to touch someone else\u2019s stuff but you were literally removing a toxic hazard from your living space that she left there for days.\n\nKick her out asap.", "NTA because she clearly didn't care about the omelet maker. You shouldn't have to live with a slob's mess.", "NTA\n\nYou already asked three times and put up for it for a month. Enough is enough and I would\u2019ve done the same thing. That\u2019s also a health hazard lowkey", "YTA. You should have thrown the roommate out instead", "NTA. Rotten eggs and dirty dishes are not only messy but a health hazard. Keeping the kitchen clean is part of being a good chef. \n\nAnd Lucy is delusional if she thinks her cooking videos will go viral. No one wants to look at a filthy kitchen.", "ESH, she's awful and wasteful but you shouldn't just throw out someone else's property. \n\nIf you're having so much trouble with her then just look for somewhere else to live. \n\nSeparately to the AITA judgement she maybe needs help? She seems to have an obsession and it's always a shame to see another person sucked into thinking they can be viral/an influencer/whatever", "YTA - I agree that its disgusting but there are other ways of dealing with this that are less extreme imo.  I know a few friends at uni who resorted to leaving dirty dishes outside/in housemate's bedrooms if they had been left dirty for a while which I think is better than throwing people's stuff away.\n\nIt's very fair to feel angry/frustrated in this situation but I think acting on it by throwing out her property is not the way to deal with this at all.  It might be good for you and the third roommate to sit down with Lucy and set clear boundaries/express your frustrations with her to try and make things easier in the long run?", "Your room mate sounds horrible, but you already know YTA for this. You can't just throw out other people's appliances", "ESH \n\nGo through the eviction process if you want the change.  Stopping to her level won\u2019t change anything.", "NTA. I would have done the same. Also she cannot just hoard shit when living with others. She needs to find a different place if that\u2019s what she wants to do.", "YTA you should pay her to replace the appliance. Two wrongs don't make a right . If it smell so bad, go put it in her room or outside.\n\n It is inconsiderate of her to not clean up after herself. However, you sound incredibly jealous. Try to work together to come up with a compromise or one of you will have to buy the other out of the lease.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBuy her a new one before she needs to sue you for it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOtherwise you risk her reataliating, and throwing away some of your stuff you regularly use - maybe your notebook, or whatever she finds. Unless she is much less of an AH than you are. YOu really did not think that through.", "ESH, two wrongs don't make a right", "ESH, but you're in a tough situation. I had an *insanely* messy roommate who did something similar. Loved to cook and would use every dish in the place, but refused to clean up until the dishes were covered in mold. Things got so bad that she would go out and buy disposable dishes to use instead of washing up.\n\nThat being said, you owe her a new omelette maker. Throwing out someone else's property is never the right solution and will make her feel more justified in her behaviour even though she's clearly wrong. \n\nYou and the other roommates need to have a sit down talk with Lucy to establish concrete kitchen use rules. Maybe even get everyone to sign an agreement! If it continues to happen after you've all had that discussion, I'd personally just start dumping all her dirty dishes in the middle of her bed until she gets the point, but I'm petty like that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
