This story mainly involves my roommate Lucy (F24).\n\nLucy is unemployed and doesn't have any major commitments, her parents fund everything she needs. She's convinced one day she's going to go viral on tiktok or youtube and be a star. She spends most of her time at the home.\n\nOne thing you need to understand about Lucy is she spends an excessive amount of time in the kitchen cooking and videoing it. She wants to go viral for her recipes, basically. Lucy doesn't eat most of the stuff she cooks and just throws it in the trash. She also makes a great deal of mess cooking and doesn't clean it up for days or even weeks.\n\nThis has only been going on for around two months so I think it might be a phase, who knows. I just wanna emphasise how much time Lucy spends cooking, she's probably in the kitchen for maybe like 7 hours everyday cooking. Me and my other roommate have asked her many times to tone it down as we often can't use the stove or oven because she's using them all but she tells us to wait until she's finished.\n\nShe has shit tons of her own special kitchen appliances (blender, food processor, rice cooker, air fryer, etc). They are never put away and always lying around on the furniture or on the counters. We don't have a lot of counter space so this is really annoying.\n\nLucy also has an omelette maker. A month ago, she used it for a video and cooked eggs with it and never washed it or anything and there's loads of egg still stuck to it.\n\nIt has started to really stink. I've asked Lucy nicely three times over the past month to clean it and put it away before it grows its own ecosystem. She says she will but never gets to it and always has an excuse like she just forgot or she's already done lots of dishwashing and she's too tired.\n\nI got fed up after it being like this for a whole month and I threw the whole omelette maker in the trash outside. Lucy is obviously royally pissed off and told me I'm bullying her and acting like a disgusting human being, and that the omelette maker wasn't hurting anyone. \n\nI told her it fucking stinks of rotten eggs (literally) and I got tired of smelling it in the kitchen.

I even had spoilt AF dorm mates who, like OP's roommate, had rich parents who paid for everything so they drove BMWs and had plenty of money to spend on whatever they want and didn't give 2 shits about actually going to classes or passing their courses. They were just there for the \"college experience\", and every time they flunked, their parents would just pay for them to retake the course. Had a friend who flunked the SAME SUBJECT 6x in a row and she finally transferred to another university and did something else, I don't know what. But there are so many entitled kids like that at some universities."]}
