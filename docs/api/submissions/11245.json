She had her baby on saturday. While she was pregnant, I was asked to come over to help her. We both have autoimmune diseases, and things for me have not been easy. In the past, with her other births (she has five kids now), I have taken care of them in a capacity that was beyond what most would do. I had been there 24/7 taking care of her and her kids for months or yrs at a time. \n\nI adore her and the kids, but I can't do it how I use to. I'm burned out and I have my own responsibilities. I still want to help but with established boundaries and expectations of what I will do this time. \nI have rats that became seriously ill unexpectedly, had to put one down and the other two are not doing well.  T\nMy partners grandmother passed away and we had her funeral to attend. Even with that I had her babies overnight while she gave birth and was over every day to help except for the day of the funeral. Months ago she said she needed me all week and overnight. I told her I couldn't do that, then I was told I was only needed on weekends and then it was  Thursday to Sunday. From the beginning I was adamant that I can't do Friday nights bc I have DnD.\n\nToday I received a message from my sister about needing me overnight on friday. I was annoyed bc the baby has only been here for five days and I'm all ready being bulldozed over.\n\nI reminded her about Friday night's and asked if another sister (20F B) could do it. This started an argument about MY inconsistent schedules. I told her I've never changed anything. She also argued about how I haven't helped like I said I would. How I wasn't there today. It's Wednesday why would I be there? Turns out from my other sister (23F N) said D was gonna ask if I come over Tuesday but she was reminded by N, that there was the funeral, and then was gonna ask if I come over Wed but she never did. \n\nB posted in the group chat that Me and N haven't done enough to help D. She was extremely rude and nasty to the both of us saying we've been selfish and telling us all the shit D has been talking. DnD wasn't an excuse to not help, N having her own baby to take care of is not an excuse. She said me not helping has been a running theme. I was done after that.  Everything I've done I get treated like this! I told them I was removing myself and no longer helping. If what I've done so far still isn't seen as enough what else can I give? She is on her own. I told them and said I was blocking them\n\nI'm still so angry and I know emotionally. I'm not thinking right. I'm torn one-half wants to follow through and leave her to figure it out. \nThe other side of me can't do it and still wants to help her. What do you think? Would I be the asshole to just leave her to fend for herself?", "created_utc": 1677705925, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11filcc/aita_for_not_helping_my_sister_postpartum/", "score": 250, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She can do it.", "NTA. You are setting a boundry. Keep at it, as it takes time to solidify.", "NTA.  You tried to help within your abilities while still having one night to yourself - totally reasonable - and she is refusing to respect those boundaries.  She has some right to expect help from family in a difficult time, but not to become the sole focus of your life.", "NTA. Maybe actually raising her kids will stop her from producing like a rat.", "NTA she shouldn\u2019t have kids she can\u2019t take care of. She is using you.", "NTA stick to your boundaries. Write them down, laminate them, make several copies, put them on her fridge, her nightstand, and the bathroom mirror. These are not your kids. While it\u2019s absolutely lovely how much you\u2019ve pitched in they are not your responsibility.", "NTA - however.\n\nYou definitely need to talk to your sister D about what she expects from you.  You need to set boundaries about what you are able to provide, because being a 24/7 caretaker for your sister and her 5 children is unreasonable.  Maybe you set it up that you can help her one or two days a week, if you want to.  She needs to realize that you have a life of your own outside of hers.\n\nWith all of that said, I think you need to have some flexibility inside the parameters you set.  Yes, Friday is for DnD, but the baby was born on Monday.  She's probably only been home from the hospital for a couple days with a newborn infant.  And yes, you kept her kids overnight while she was in the hospital giving birth, which was outside the normal days that you help, but it's a pretty extenuating circumstance.  These are inconvenient for you, but reasonable requests on her part if you help her.", "Oh yes, there's been plenty of conversations about her having kids and expecting me or my other sister N to be full-time help.

I'm so dang tired from it all", "Thank you so much! I think that's exactly what I'm going to do.

It's heartbreaking, they're a little over a yr old.", "That's my biggest problem, I love her so much and I know it's A LOT to deal with. Sometimes, I get her appreciation for it all but when it seems to really be needed in moments like this. She is so consumed by her own stress that she doesn't care. And there's also the expectation from other family members, mostly our parents, to just give her what she needs no matter what.", "Under normal circumstances, yes.

When will they visit her?", "I am sorry, but she is not showing you love or respect in return. She is very entitled and you all seem to be enabling her.", "Sounds like everyone has been enabling her so she could have 5 kids by the age of 26.  At what point does it stop?!?", "Bear in mind the sister is a single mum of 5 children including a newborn, she's going through a lot. But OP is absolutely within their right to refuse to help as she's not the children's parent and the sister shouldn't have had all her children if she couldn't support them and when her ex left she should have worked things out then. It's a tough situation on all sides.
