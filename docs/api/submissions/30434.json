She has a dorm on campus but she doesn\u2019t live there. I love my daughter but she can be a lot. Drama follows her everywhere and I was hoping she would grow out of it but it never happened. Due to this she has gone through multiple friends group and as she puts it, they are jealous so she doesn\u2019t have college friends.\n\nNow I married when she turned 18, I was never married and her bio mom, wasn\u2019t in the picture. So this was an adjustment but I want to make it clear I did the right steps. I introduced them when I was serious (2 years in). I spent more time with her, I didn\u2019t force them together , we made boundaries for my wife like punishment comes to me not her. When she was struggling I got her into therapy and did secession with her. She stopped when she hit 18 since I can\u2019t make her go.\n\nMy daughter is making it impossible for them to get along, if my wife tells her food is ready she gets pissed she is bothering her. If she doesn\u2019t tell her than she is pissed she wasn\u2019t invited. It\u2019s contradiction after contradiction. I have talked to her, my wife has tried to do what she asked and then she is pissed she did that. It\u2019s impossible.\n\nNow to the main issue my wife\u2019s birthday was yesterday. I put out her presents/cake on the table. I had work to so I left it. I came back and all her presents were opened and my daughter was eating a piece of cake. I asked why the fuck she would do that. She told me she doesn\u2019t deserve birthday presents.\n\nThis is when I had enough and told her if she hates her stepmom so much she can leave. That she has a dorm and I don\u2019t want to see her until an apology to me and my wife. She started crying and called me a jerk.\n\nI having getting a lot of texts from her and I am doubting my decision.", "created_utc": 1699277844, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17p2wfd/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_if_she_hates_her/", "score": 4321, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I have documented qualities of BPD (borderline) as well as ADHD \nThose two things compounded with alcohol to foster the ideal conditions for my emotional instability to become my accepted and most common state of mind.\n\nRight now I am in a DBT (dialectical behaviour therapy) program. It's one of the only treatments that's evidence-based and very effective for dealing with the emotional instability and lashing out of people with qualities of borderline (and other types of emotion dysregulation as a result of bipolar, ptsd and more). It focuses on:\n- developing mindfulness (becoming aware of your present moment and allowing strong feelings to pass through the mind neutrally and without judgement)\n- distress tolerance (learning skills to tolerate when we inevitably do experience strong emotion)\n- interpersonal effectiveness (learning a framework and techniques for improving communication and achieving long term goals)\n\nWith a grain of salt, it sounds like your daughter might be dealing with something in this ballpark of qualities of BPD. Late teens and early adulthood is the age when it really starts to flare up and it can lead to a lot of issues like heavy substance use, poor finances and really bad relationships. Please be aware, this is not uncommon but it does need to be addressed professionally! Many people have these qualities, and many people access this type of therapy to help cope and deal. An effective round of DBT (involves a skills building group and 1-on-1 therapy weekly) can actually cause a person's qualities of BPD to go into remission for long periods of time. Doing a round of DBT skills group every couple of years is actually part of my plan to keep my BPD qualities in remission.\n\nDBT posits this idea around \"dialectics\": two things which seem in opposition can both be true. You can love your daughter and continue to emit expressions of that love, while also protecting your own wellbeing and the relationship with your current partner. Your daughter sounds like she is living a lot of the time in an emotional state of mind and really needs therapy to deal with those emotions, because they're resulting in a warped set of values on how to behave and live life. It also sounds like you and your partner legitimately need time away from your daughter, aka, she needs to spend some time at the dorm and give you space (and maybe you and partner need to vacation somewhere?), but be prepared to continue to be burdened by unstable lashing out when you try and set a boundary that exists beyond the interaction that caused the heightened emotion in the first place, like of you want her to NOT stay over at the house for a month, just as an example. I wish you luck! Remember, you can love your daughter and also protect your own wellbeing, hope you consider that.\n\nMy dad and I don't have a perfect relationship now, but it is one based on respect and there is zero lashing out coming from me. All of our conversations now come from a place of kindness and support for one another.", "NTA - time to kick this little birdie out if the nest.

She needed therapy years ago. When you first noticed she keeps on losing her friend groups and her disdain for them after was probably when you should have tried to get her in. I don't really blame you though. Its quite natural for a parent to consider that not uncommon growing pains of growing up. I would expect most kids to do just that. Its also way more obvious looking back than when it actually happens.\n\nBetter late than never though.

As such, although there is no need for them to love each other, they need to respect the place each occupy in your life. Ask her if your wife has ever threatened that? List a few ways she has threatened not only you're wife's place but also your own happiness. That until she learns to give the respect she was given when she obviously didn't deserve it, she can't take her normal place in your life. And that wasn't your wife's doing, it was hers and the fact you are worthy of and deserve the happiness she brings to your life.\n\nNo matter what, you need to be firm. She needs to do the work. She's the one that was committing the wrong and both you and your wife have been victims of hers.

He\u2019s blaming everything on her and he\u2019s not trying to get to the bottom of it.\n\nMy point is if he and his wife went to therapy to see if there was other ways that they could handle this other than kicking her out. He won\u2019t let her back unless she apologizes, and fake apologies don\u2019t solve anything. And she\u2019s holding her ground and saying well then I guess you don\u2019t want me around which I\u2019m sure is not true.

Kicking her out only makes her say see he doesn\u2019t love me anymore his wife is more important. She might need to be on medication she might be struggling in college and he\u2019s not being supportive of that there\u2019s so many things that could be going on that she is just decided that nobody\u2019s worth it.\n\nShe is having a mental health crisis.

I have never told her to get out I have told her that if she doesn\u2019t like something then she needs to go somewhere where it suits her, but I never kicked her out.\n\nIt\u2019s awful to see someone go through this.She is finally realizing that it\u2019s not everybody around her that it\u2019s her.

He clearly loves her but loving someone doesn't mean you support or accept everything they do. In fact, I would say that at this point kicking her out is loving, even though it may not feel like it. She's making herself miserable and she'll continue down this toxic path if she doesn't get a wake up call. \n\nShe causes drama everywhere she goes and it's on her to stop blaming other people and figure out why she is the way she is. At this point in her life, because she is 20 years old, she has to be the one to get herself into therapy if that's what she needs. SHE has to do it. SHE has to say what she feels and what she needs. OP has already tried. He can't do any more for her if she isn't willing to meet him in the middle with all of this. \n\nI'm sure that if at some point she figures herself out and gets herself into therapy and starts to work on herself, OP will have no problem welcoming her back in.

You can teach them everything and it will eventually fall back on them to either absorb and use it or to not. The fact that this young woman has zero friends at 20 in an environment that generally is great for finding friends speaks a lot. The fact that she couldn't hold on to friends speaks volumes. Op says they got her therapy and everything. Goes back to something I heard once. \"If all your exes are crazy you may just be the problem.\"", "You said she had a personality disorder rather confidently. You may not have given a specific diagnosis but you were sure there was one to give after a post about a specific incident with limited other info provided. You were for sure overconfidently making assumptions based on almost nothing and stating it as fact.", "That\u2019s a lot of words to say you\u2019re upset because I don\u2019t agree with you", "I know, it's so deeply ingrained in me that I have to fight myself mentally. I'm slowly learning though.\n\nThe one I had as a child after my dad passed (I was 9), had a really good solution where she pretty much \"tricked me\" into talking. She got me pens and papers and I got to draw during our sessions. I had this huge taped together \"map\" that I'd drawn with tons of characters and animals on it by the end of it all. I'd just answer questions or explain how I felt while I was focusing on drawing", "I didn\u2019t beat her, I threatened to do so\u2026. So not the same thing\u2026", "She beat him to death because he kept rubbing up against her for love and she didn\u2019t like it\u2026 she threw his dead body in the litter box and left him there\u2026", "Yes they are and she was by one of the best doctors my parents could get out of Denver. She is 20 now and has done far worse to the point she is not welcomed at our home or my parents home.", "I smacked her in the back of the head\u2026. THATS NOT BEATING HER\u2026.. You people are ridiculous", "Also she was in my home visiting for the party.", "You\u2019re welcome, I hope you feel a little bit lighter today and I don\u2019t blame you one bit!", "I\u2019d have smacked her upside the head and given her a good shove.", "Those were his words. She was horrible, but he did abandoned her with those words don\u2019t come back to apologize.", "He said she had to apologize first", "Keep reaching!", "You might be a better visual person than a verbal one. Have any of your therapists brought up writing? Sometimes diaries work, but so do stories. Writing some fiction might help you work out some things, or give you a place to get it out without being judged.", "How do you think a mentally ill child sees an adult human threatening to beat her? Probably like a terrifying threat, spiking the child\u2019s anxiety and potentially triggering an episode of whatever her condition is. You\u2019re bigger than her, smarter than her, have more resources than her, and invited her into your home. Despite all that, you had to rely on threats of violence and a smack to the head? BS", "Ya i\u2019d be in prison for life if someone did that to my baby. \n\nI am so sorry this happened to you. I hope shes locked up soon", "Oh my god.. I'm so sorry to hear that.", "Part of the diagnostic criteria of APD is that the patient is over 18, and showed signs of CD / ODD before adulthood", "Then don\u2019t invite her into your home in the first place. If you can\u2019t stop yourself from impulsively hitting mentally ill children, you shouldn\u2019t be inviting them over.", "he didn\u2019t abandon her. you can keep trying to twist this to make the daughter a victim but op was perfectly reasonable by telling her to stay where she is unless she\u2019s willing to take accountability for her actions. she\u2019s an adult, an apology isn\u2019t that hard.", "boo hoo he\u2019s making an adult apologize for being disrespectful? you\u2019re seriously trying to make op the bad guy for not enabling her", "And? What about that says she can never come home?", "What did I say that wasn't true?", "Thank you", "Ok? Well she was diagnosed at that age and after killing two animals and suspected of killing another one they knew what and who she was. Trust me it stuck and is more apparent now then it was before. So their findings were spot on.", "Oh my god\u2026. First she isn\u2019t allowed at my home or my parents anymore\u2026 read above\u2026. Second stop trying to make this about me abusing a mentally ill child. She knew what she was doing and it was a response. I could have beaten her, smacked her in the face, shoved her out the door but no I smacked her in the back of the head and told her she needed to grow up and stop abusing my 4 yr old. Sorry but not sorry.", "Sure anybody can apologize but do they mean it? So she comes back and says sorry and then everything keeps going. She obviously is very troubled. That\u2019s why I say there\u2019s probably more going on. But you don\u2019t just kick someone out and stay until you do what I want you can\u2019t come back and that\u2019s what he said", "For real. I understand the advocating for OP stepping up. But my parents never held any boundaries on their own dignity needs and respect against my teenage brattiness and I didn't respect them for it and it made it harder for me to pull my head out of my ass. He can recognize she's acting out without giving her the continued room to be so deliberately disrespectful. Her saying all the stuff in text Trying to get back to her cush life at home is manipulative. He can demonstrate he is always there for her without allowing his support to be on her terms.....which um is the parenting problem that likely led to this in the first place...telling him he's a bad parent for having a line in the sand and consequences that are serious but not harmful (she has a place to live already that he pays for) because *you* would always allow your kids to move back in isn't helpful. You can advocate for him showing support and understanding to his daughter acting out without pinning it down to 'if he doesn't do x, then he is showing no support' in these circumstances. I know for a fact that if I treated my mom like crap because I resented my parents and then have let me move back in, I would only lose respect for both and feel further tempted, inclined, or all in on continuing to find ways to be disrespectful. It doesn't matter what the relationship is, tolerating disrespect without consequences never ever ever helps the relationship or the person who is struggling.", "I\u2019m happy to engage with literate people. You have yourself a nice day."]}
