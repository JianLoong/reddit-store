She has a dorm on campus but she doesn\u2019t live there. I love my daughter but she can be a lot. Drama follows her everywhere and I was hoping she would grow out of it but it never happened. Due to this she has gone through multiple friends group and as she puts it, they are jealous so she doesn\u2019t have college friends.\n\nNow I married when she turned 18, I was never married and her bio mom, wasn\u2019t in the picture. So this was an adjustment but I want to make it clear I did the right steps. I introduced them when I was serious (2 years in). I spent more time with her, I didn\u2019t force them together , we made boundaries for my wife like punishment comes to me not her. When she was struggling I got her into therapy and did secession with her. She stopped when she hit 18 since I can\u2019t make her go.\n\nMy daughter is making it impossible for them to get along, if my wife tells her food is ready she gets pissed she is bothering her. If she doesn\u2019t tell her than she is pissed she wasn\u2019t invited. It\u2019s contradiction after contradiction. I have talked to her, my wife has tried to do what she asked and then she is pissed she did that. It\u2019s impossible.\n\nNow to the main issue my wife\u2019s birthday was yesterday. I put out her presents/cake on the table. I had work to so I left it. I came back and all her presents were opened and my daughter was eating a piece of cake. I asked why the fuck she would do that. She told me she doesn\u2019t deserve birthday presents.\n\nThis is when I had enough and told her if she hates her stepmom so much she can leave. That she has a dorm and I don\u2019t want to see her until an apology to me and my wife. She started crying and called me a jerk.\n\nI having getting a lot of texts from her and I am doubting my decision.", "created_utc": 1699277844, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17p2wfd/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_if_she_hates_her/", "score": 8618, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I have documented qualities of BPD (borderline) as well as ADHD \nThose two things compounded with alcohol to foster the ideal conditions for my emotional instability to become my accepted and most common state of mind.\n\nRight now I am in a DBT (dialectical behaviour therapy) program. It's one of the only treatments that's evidence-based and very effective for dealing with the emotional instability and lashing out of people with qualities of borderline (and other types of emotion dysregulation as a result of bipolar, ptsd and more). It focuses on:\n- developing mindfulness (becoming aware of your present moment and allowing strong feelings to pass through the mind neutrally and without judgement)\n- distress tolerance (learning skills to tolerate when we inevitably do experience strong emotion)\n- interpersonal effectiveness (learning a framework and techniques for improving communication and achieving long term goals)\n\nWith a grain of salt, it sounds like your daughter might be dealing with something in this ballpark of qualities of BPD. Late teens and early adulthood is the age when it really starts to flare up and it can lead to a lot of issues like heavy substance use, poor finances and really bad relationships. Please be aware, this is not uncommon but it does need to be addressed professionally! Many people have these qualities, and many people access this type of therapy to help cope and deal. An effective round of DBT (involves a skills building group and 1-on-1 therapy weekly) can actually cause a person's qualities of BPD to go into remission for long periods of time. Doing a round of DBT skills group every couple of years is actually part of my plan to keep my BPD qualities in remission.\n\nDBT posits this idea around \"dialectics\": two things which seem in opposition can both be true. You can love your daughter and continue to emit expressions of that love, while also protecting your own wellbeing and the relationship with your current partner. Your daughter sounds like she is living a lot of the time in an emotional state of mind and really needs therapy to deal with those emotions, because they're resulting in a warped set of values on how to behave and live life. It also sounds like you and your partner legitimately need time away from your daughter, aka, she needs to spend some time at the dorm and give you space (and maybe you and partner need to vacation somewhere?), but be prepared to continue to be burdened by unstable lashing out when you try and set a boundary that exists beyond the interaction that caused the heightened emotion in the first place, like of you want her to NOT stay over at the house for a month, just as an example. I wish you luck! Remember, you can love your daughter and also protect your own wellbeing, hope you consider that.\n\nMy dad and I don't have a perfect relationship now, but it is one based on respect and there is zero lashing out coming from me. All of our conversations now come from a place of kindness and support for one another.", "NTA - time to kick this little birdie out if the nest.

She needed therapy years ago. When you first noticed she keeps on losing her friend groups and her disdain for them after was probably when you should have tried to get her in. I don't really blame you though. Its quite natural for a parent to consider that not uncommon growing pains of growing up. I would expect most kids to outgrow such things. Its also way more obvious looking back than when it actually happens.\n\nBetter late than never though.

As such, although there is no need for them to love each other, they need to respect the place each occupy in your life. Ask her if your wife has ever threatened that? List a few ways she has threatened not only you're wife's place but also your own happiness. That until she learns to give the respect she was given when she obviously didn't deserve it, she can't take her normal place in your life. And that wasn't your wife's doing, it was hers and the fact you are worthy of and deserve the happiness she brings to your life.\n\nNo matter what, you need to be firm. She needs to do the work. She's the one that was committing the wrong and both you and your wife have been victims of hers.

He\u2019s blaming everything on her and he\u2019s not trying to get to the bottom of it.\n\nMy point is if he and his wife went to therapy to see if there was other ways that they could handle this other than kicking her out. He won\u2019t let her back unless she apologizes, and fake apologies don\u2019t solve anything. And she\u2019s holding her ground and saying well then I guess you don\u2019t want me around which I\u2019m sure is not true.

I have never told her to get out I have told her that if she doesn\u2019t like something then she needs to go somewhere where it suits her, but I never kicked her out.\n\nIt\u2019s awful to see someone go through this.She is finally realizing that it\u2019s not everybody around her that it\u2019s her.

You chose wife over daughter when you brought her in and daughter wants you to pick her (for something big too). So, daughter hasn\u2019t outgrown these feelings and resulting behavior. Your daughter needs help. You need help. You don\u2019t have magic-wand to fix it. \n\nBest thing to do is, yes, get your daughter the help she needs. But please take responsibility. Admit wrongdoing for keeping a big secret and then springing a new lifestyle, with a new person , and upsetting her safe space and safe relationship\u2014You. \n\nSo apologize to daughter (alone, without wife). She\u2019ll need to hear you\u2019re reasoning of wanting best for her (but hold for now as just \u201cI meant well for you but I messed up. I sprung wife on you, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d) You can get in-depth with your list of reasons and explanations for when she will be more likely to listen and not feel as if your reasons (bigger picture) are bigger than her needs and feelings. Because everything is bigger, more important, than her. She used to be biggest only thing. \n\nWhen she\u2019s ready, how wonderful it will be to hear you share things you\u2019ve not share\u2014with anyone. Now just for her. You were scared. You didn\u2019t want to be alone. You didn\u2019t want daughter to grow up without woman to take care of things. You wanted family life for her. And all the things you dreamed of having and doing for her\u2014when she was in your arms for first time. That\u2019s ultimately what you\u2019ve worked toward fulfilling. And you\u2019ve done a really Great Job, Dad. She just doesn\u2019t know that. \n\nHer vision of perfect dad and family life is different. It\u2019s what it was\u2014great life YOU made for her. And was taken away from her. Daughter likely views wife as took her life away, changed it (normal for kids, dad). \n\nAnd she got such big love and hugs when she cried. Neither of you realized she needed more, not just when crying. Now with wife, likely only when crying or hardly ever. So wife is big problem in your daughters eyes. She took her daddy away (again, normal for kids). \n\nYour daughter is important. She loved just you. She likely loved the life you two had. Know why?? You\u2019re a Great Dad. You\u2019ve worked so hard to give her good life. You\u2019ve provided. You\u2019ve stressed. You\u2019ve worried. You\u2019ve wanted more for her. Your daughter was likely shielded from your fears, worries, concerns. Doesn\u2019t realize that in your mind, the perfect Wife would make things better for both of you\u2014and help your daughter in ways you felt you couldn\u2019t adequately help her (like tantrums, wining, crying, girlie stuff, girl questions, coming into womanhood). Understandably so, Dad, you tried, want best. Normal for dads. But your daughter doesn\u2019t know how much. Therein lies your opportunity. \n\nTalk to your daughter. Confess. Open up. Tell her Love. Let her see your fears and tears. Maybe that comes first and foremost before you do anything else. You know best. You\u2019re great dad. Figure out how to stage these 2 major sit down discussions (with wife out of house for privacy). \n\nTherein lies your next opportunity. If you were to take her away, just 2 of you, where will she want to go? A beach? A lake? A resort? A cruise? Don\u2019t be surprised if it\u2019s something like Disney (some childhood place she always wanted or would like to feel like a kid again with you). Whatever it is, please take her. Father-Daughter vacation, just 2 of you. \n\nIF\u2026wife starts acting jealous, or makes very subtle hints about a vacation with her (maybe gets brochures or bathing suit and flirts with you about wearing it)\u2026well you\u2019ve got 1 passive aggressive wife you just did not realize. And may explain the cake issue because your daughter has been (for how long?) unable to express this, lacks maturity to do so, and let her pent up feelings and anger and rage out on gifts and cake. If this\u2019s case (at least consider that it may be)\u2026.Nip it in the bud\u2014and fast. But IF\u2026wife makes just few subtle hints or desire for wife vacation with you or we-can\u2019t-afford-it objections\u2026well you got 2 woman competing for hierarchy and attention. Nip it in the bud. And IF\u2026wife is nothing but supportive, happy for you and daughter (genuinely, not fake or over top, and consistently even behind your back) well you\u2019ve got wife in your corner (just don\u2019t impose wife or wife\u2019s how-wonderful good-nature on your daughter, in other words\u2014Don\u2019t Oversell Wife Anymore). Daughter doesn\u2019t want convincing, reminding, like scolding lectures\u2014she wants you. You can do it. \n\nLet her have you. Both do therapy. But she needs You. \n\nWishing you bliss now \n\n\ud83c\udf40", "Right? Maybe if you\u2019re 4 and literally don\u2019t know any better/have no impulse control\u2026 but at 20??? No fucking way.

That's not to say you did anything particularly bad from the perspective of how you've treated her as a person but you may have made this bed for yourself to lay in if there was minimal to no effort to even encourage a relationship with other females her age, extended family that happened to be female, or even knowledge let alone exposure to other people you may have dated over the years even if not as serious. I think it makes sense to introduce her only to people you're serious with when the child is under the age of maybe 12, but once they've reached a relatively stable age of reason, they should certainly be old enough to understand that a girlfriend isn't your stepmom... But it's not like you can go back and change it anymore than you can specifically fix it now.\n\nIt sounds to me like she has a very strong oppositional feeling towards sharing your attention and your love, and while I can generally understand where those feelings may be coming from, I do recognize them as a pretty serious problem with her being an adult and having what is essentially a temper tantrum. Nothing you do or say is going to make her any more friendly or open to having that relationship except for maybe making it abundantly clear that while you understand it is a very big change, that change isn't going anywhere and the only thing she will gain by trying to alienate your wife at this point that's what all through the course of the relationships is ultimately alienation from you.\n\nNot to say that I think you'll abandon your kid or anything but it's more like, she's acting entitled to your time and attention full time and that's just not how life works. You are certainly allowed to explore your own social connections and fulfill your own social needs. It sounds like you probably put a lot of things on the back burner waiting for her to become an adult and start learning to forge her own path... But she's in this us against the world mentality that's been there for as long as she can remember and it probably feels terrifying to her that you've gotten married and you're building a life that doesn't always include her.\n\nShe definitely needs to be in one-on-one therapy and probably would benefit you as well so you could help yourself understand these kinds of vibes. Had she grown up with a mom and other kids in the house, the kind of thing where another woman in the house is getting presents and that being upsetting would have been tackled when she was like 5 years old.. she says your wife doesn't deserve presents and that's obviously ludicrous and it is well warranted for you to tell her to get her shit together before she decides she's going to come back in your house...\n\nI honestly think you would be doing her a benefit by making her stay in the dorms. Even if you say she's allowed to come home every weekend but she cannot show up at your house earlier than say 6:00 on a Friday night? Personally I would push it even to Saturday morning. Part of why she doesn't have a friend's group is because she has had this dedicated relationship with you and none of her friends are going to be wanting to deal with that solo kid mentality that she seems to have incorporated into her adulthood. She probably doesn't get along with roommates very well right now because she's used to be part of the final say on all decisions and hasn't had much practice allowing other people to be special.. But insisting that she not only used the resources she has allocated to her, as dorm rooms are not cheap... But also making a distinction that while she has a place in your home still, when school is in session and she has a dorm room, that dorm room is effectively her home and the majority of her time spent sleeping and eating and such needs to be at her home, not yours. Some kids really struggle with coming to terms with the transition out of the house and how that house space can change when they're not there all the time, so it may be that after you got married and you really started building a home with your wife, there were too many changes occurring between time she was coming home and so it's easier for her to keep those things in check if she's just there all the time... But at some point she has to be told that she has a space in the home but it is not exclusively her home and she needs to be making steps to find her own home if she doesn't want to live in the dorms.", ">If she doesn't  change her attitude, there's a very lonely life path ahead for her.\n\nPlease read this again, OP. Your daughter is not on a good path.", "To me, from what limited description of the situation we have, it sounds like the daughter has a Cluster B personality disorder but it hasn't caused her enough hardship in life yet for her to admit it and seek treatment. Some people never get there, but as far as I'm concerned, forcing people to face real consequences for their actions is a way to get them there.\n\nDisclaimer: Not a mental health professional; just worked in Psychology research.", "My guess would be that behavior is the result of hands off parenting. OP said he hoped that when she was younger he hoped she would grow out of it. The consequences of her actions probably never came to her.", "To be honest it's not a \"group decision\".  In his situation I would privately ask my wife what SHE wanted to happen, and I would promise her that I would make it \"my decision\" whatever she decided and convey it to the daughter as an absolute.", "Exactly. It sucks, but you can't just let a situation like this go on forever.", "I'd like to know more about the mom situation, it's not just something that can be ignored.", "I'm annoyed that OP said \"drama always follows her.\"  No, she creates drama.  Stop describing it like she's being relentlessly pursued by some drama poltergeist.", "NTA, she is 20 years old, that is old enough to know she was wrong. You deserve happiness as well!!", "It\u2019s not BS, Dad. It\u2019s important to you. It\u2019s important to Daughter. You\u2019re good dad wanting better for her. You can do it.", "The stick to your guns.  She can stay in the dorm until she learns to grow up.  Though I\u2019m guessing her roommate has had enough of her crap as well.", "Your daughter has some serious mental health problem(s).\n\nHas she been diagnosed with anything?", "Or you're at a Klan Rally.", "My boys live at home while going to college. It is the only way we can afford to send them and they still needed loans. They visit with their friends over discord. Sometimes my youngest will have a friend host the group for an overnight. It isn't weird living at home but it is a waste to have a dorm and then live at home. Plus the daughter is an ass. She needs to be kicked out.", "> wife-kid conflicts\n\nOP doesn't have a \"kid.\" He has an adult daughter.", "OMG THIS.\nTHANK YOU.", "Well, he can back track to his single days with his princess, and his wife can find a spouse that prioritizes her happiness over wringing his hands over a 20 year old thar has zero social skills or self awareness. \n\nThis isn't going to get better.", "Agreed, if someone that age can't maintain at least a couple of friendships then it means that there is something more serious going on.", "This is fascinating to me because I almost dropped out of college for that exact reason, but I stuck with it out of spite more than anything. I tried going to events and participating in stuff but never found a friend group I could stick with until my senior year of college. And then COVID hit.", "I\u2019ll be grateful paying only $4800 a semester.", "For tolerating this as long as he has, for putting his wife in a position to live like this, by not drawing the line sooner and demanding respect for his wife. The op has been unfair to both of them. He spoiled his daughter to the point of making her a spoiled brat and unable to build relationships in her life. He condoned her behavior all these years and subjected his wife to being treated terribly.", "I would suggest all. To varying degrees of course, but our make up is directly related to our childhood and trauma shapes easily. The trauma is not always obvious either.", "The wife deserves peace \u2014 not a Combat Zone .", "That discipline decision was the right one. There is absolutely no way it would not backslashes hard if wife was put in position of responsibility. It would be terribly unfair to the wife.\n\nThe daughter was a stranger kid to the wife. And wife was stranger woman to the daughter. They were not mother and daughter, the wife had no responsibility and no love. Treating the situation as it actually is, as a strangers is correct.", "You think the 18 year old who's never had a mom is going to respond to that, I'm sure the step mom also feels it isn't her place. She clearly doesn't she the step mom as an authority, she's jealous and misses when it was just her and Daddy. Plain and simple", "Now you're just milking it.", "On birthday cake in this case", "It's not even tough love. She's lucky in that she has a place to go. She NEEDS to learn to co-exist with others and obviously cannot do that at home.", "Yes I agree but wife doesn\u2019t need to speak to her ever again, the guy doesn\u2019t need to involve his wife to be a dad", "Leaving discipline to the father didn't work, obviously.  If one of my kids was treating another person the way this 'child' has been treating the stepmother, that person absolutely has the right to deal with it on their own behalf.  No human being should be expected to have to just sit back and tolerate that sort of behaviour (disrespect and yes, abuse) toward them pending 'discipline' from their parent.", "You cud be right.", "My school required dorm life for my freshman year which is a huge cash grab considering I lived in town. I had a childhood in my own bedroom and had to either adjust to a shabby room with a smaller, shittier bed and no privacy and a lot of noise and, to put it bluntly, not being able to fart whenever, or I could stay in my own room while my dorm roommate got to enjoy having the room to herself. I didn't spend EVERY night at home because the dorm was pretty convenient, but it isn't as fun as you see in movies and tv shows, especially if you get a roommate you don't like. \n\nThat said, OP's daughter wouldn't be homeless if dad kicked her out and she has proven she doesn't appreciate her optional comfort and doesn't need to be there. I can see waffling if the dorm weren't a thing, but she adds nothing but stress to OP's house and will learn nothing if she isn't forced to co-exist with strangers be necessity. She will learn nothing at home.", "Not with her behavior. Her roommates and floor mates probably hate her already", "It\u2019s totally hit or miss.

It is what you make of it.", "I lived in a dorm as a college exchange student  in Finland.  My two roommates were also nursing students,  from Portugal. The other American girls were studying for NCLEX, my room was always filled with culinary &tourism students... i loved it.", "This is the one.", "I lived in a shitty concrete dorm with three inch cockroaches and made friends that I'm still in touch with 40 years later. It's not about the building...", "It was the best thing about university for me. Although in the UK we don't share rooms usually, which would make a difference.", "Definitely depends on the rooms. I was in a 2 bedroom 2 bathroom dorm with 4 chicks on total. Then I was in a 2 bedroom 1 bathroom place, 4 chicks. They both were amazing. We all had enough space to share, and we got along so well. It helped that my Resident Director specifically made the arrangements based on our hobbies, goals and majors. The application was pretty in depth when it came to who you are.", "Agreed."]}
