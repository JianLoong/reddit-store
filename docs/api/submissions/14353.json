He's angry about the situation and you are conveniently there to feel that anger.", "NTA. They should have talked things thru before letting Vincent make decisions on false hope. They probably planned the whole thing together hoping Jamie would give in. Your brother is TA for not accepting the reality of their relationship.", "You are obviously NTA.\n\nYour brother is an AH, mostly to his stepson. For *13 years* he has encouraged this delusion? He let his stepson waste his first year of college chasing after something unrelated, in a seriously emotionally harmful way? He doesn't have Vincent in counseling?\n\nJamie is right to live his own life, and has always had the right to be cordial but not close to his father's new relatives. He doesn't owe Vincent a close brotherly relationship, and is probably the only one here responding reasonably.", "Info: was your brother already divorced before Vincent\u2019s mom died?

Either way you\u2019re NTA.", "I've been seeing this a lot where after a parent dies, the widow/widower jumps into a new relationship, and marriage very soon after the death and the child doesn't actually get enough time to grieve. Something traumatic happened to Jamie at a young age when navigating your emotions is near impossible as you are still learning how to do it. Your brother didn't help that happen by starting this relationship, and he didn't listen to what Jamie wanted or needed. I don't think your brother should've stayed a single dad forever, but it should've been a journey him and Jamie took together. NTA but your brother is.", "NTA, except your brother. He should have helped Vincent realise that going to a college to get your step brother to like you isn't healthy nor is it a right choice for Vincent. Affection and feelings can't be forced to develop, force only develops hatred.
