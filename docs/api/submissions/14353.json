He's angry about the situation and you are conveniently there to feel that anger.", "NTA. They should have talked things thru before letting Vincent make decisions on false hope. They probably planned the whole thing together hoping Jamie would give in. Your brother is TA for not accepting the reality of their relationship.", "You are obviously NTA.\n\nYour brother is an AH, mostly to his stepson. For *13 years* he has encouraged this delusion? He let his stepson waste his first year of college chasing after something unrelated, in a seriously emotionally harmful way? He doesn't have Vincent in counseling?\n\nJamie is right to live his own life, and has always had the right to be cordial but not close to his father's new relatives. He doesn't owe Vincent a close brotherly relationship, and is probably the only one here responding reasonably.", "Info: was your brother already divorced before Vincent\u2019s mom died?

Either way you\u2019re NTA.", "I've been seeing this a lot where after a parent dies, the widow/widower jumps into a new relationship, and marriage very soon after the death and the child doesn't actually get enough time to grieve. Something traumatic happened to Jamie at a young age when navigating your emotions is near impossible as you are still learning how to do it. Your brother didn't help that happen by starting this relationship, and he didn't listen to what Jamie wanted or needed. I don't think your brother should've stayed a single dad forever, but it should've been a journey him and Jamie took together. NTA but your brother is.", "NTA, except your brother. He should have helped Vincent realise that going to a college to get your step brother to like you isn't healthy nor is it a right choice for Vincent. Affection and feelings can't be forced to develop, force only develops hatred.

Vincent needs therapy, and Jamie is right to protect himself from his stepbrother attaching to him.

It isnt: I am not shocked that this is the outcome, I could have told you this years ago if you had asked me then.", "NTA. Sounds like Vincent could use some counseling. It\u2019s very odd that he would follow Jamie to a college that doesn\u2019t even have his major just so he could move into his apartment. Weirdly clingy.", "Info : no one is your family has thought of getting your bother interned ? He seems to have some mental issues", "NTA.  Sounds like Vincent has formed an unhealthy attachment to Jamie due to your brother's encouragement, even though Jamie clearly stated they would never be brothers.  Vincent should never have been encouraged to go to the same college for the reasons given, and it sounds like he needs serious help with his mental health due to your brother & his own  mother's neglect, and failure to recognise what was happening due to them burying their heads in the sand.", "NTA. I think they put the wrong brother in therapy.", "NTA \n\nKnow what\u2019s a big deal, moving a new family in not even a year after the death of your child\u2019s mother and insisting he\u2019s the issue", "Poor Vincent. He is the only one I feel sorry for in this story.", "NTA.\n\nI'm not sure what your brother's got to do with this. Why is he weighing in? This is none of his business.\n\n\n.", "NTA the fact they didn't realise even now Jamie doesn't see Vincent as a brother and wants separation from everything is concerning, but uts more concerning that Vincent would still be trying to push a relationship rather than following his career preferences", "NTA", "NTA, Jamie does not see them as siblings so why would he now.", "NTA\nIt seems as if Jaime has been direct about his feelings in the blended family all along. Yet, even with family therapy, your brother has never accepted his son's feelings are as they are. Either bro has blinded himself with his big happy family fantasy, or he's always expected Jaime to \"come around\" to his way of thinking. Either way, bro has never accepted his son's perceptions and feelings about adjusting to the loss of his mother, and the blended family that came soon after.", "NTA. Parents have perspective issues, your brother and nephew are refusing to see what they don\u2019t want to see.", "Exactly. OP's brother finally got it. There will be more awkward situations at weddings, the arrival of grandchildren, holidays, etc. Jaime and his immediate family will see April as his dad's wife and Vincent as April's son. Not grandma April or uncle Vincent. And, he needs to brace himself for that reality.", "Trust me I know a thing or two about siblings studying the same things and in the same university, but it was the parents who suggested it. Didn't go well and had to start over. Jamie made it a clear resounding NO, but I guess it was lost in translation.", "Yeah, me & my sister did not go to the same school & I didn't want to live with her (we had enough conflict living together where she'd use my toothbrush or towel, etc...). We don't live together now either - she has a husband, 2 year old & her own way of living life which isn't the same as mine.", "in\u00b7ter\n/in\u02c8t\u0259r/\nverb\nplace (a corpse) in a grave or tomb, typically with funeral rites.\n\nSeems a bit extreme lol\n\nThough getting him committed for being obtuse is also extreme.", "Interesting. I feel sorry for the son whose father forced into a new family a year after his mother died", "I feel like Vincent needs to figure out what he wants to study. Picking a school just because a family member or friend goes there isn't the right move - he needs to focus on what is best for him.", "I think your brother should go to therapy, this time to deal with his presenting issues", "He also probably feels bad about Vincent feeling bad and rejected. His kid is hurting and he can't help him AND his other kid is the cause. It might make him feel like he failed somewhere as a parent. Much easier to be angry at your siblings then deal with all those uncomfortable feelings.", "I don't feel that Jamie is the cause.  **People not listening to Jamie for umpteen years is the cause.**  Vincent chose really dumb, illogical reasons for choosing that particular college.  He's clearly still hurting from Jamie's rejection and needs some therapy to deal with that, instead of making life decisions based on it.\n\nAs far as Jamie goes, he's entitled to his own feelings, and you can't force someone to love somebody else.  He lost his mother so young, and then his dad moved a new family in a year later.  Of course he didn't accept them."]}
