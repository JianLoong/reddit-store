Of course he didn't accept them.", "Honestly I\u2019m more mad at April because she didn\u2019t sit Vincent down and talk to him before letting him go to college.

He doesn't want to, for whatever reason. \n\nThe fact that the parents continue to push it, refuse to accept it, and enable the adult brother to push Jamie into a relationship is confusing and probably causing more pain for Vincent.

Is your brother expecting Jamie to share his bedroom with Vincent?  Who will bay Vincent's share of the bills? Jamie and his roommates are making a go at college.  They are not there to hang out, they are there to get an education. Vincent needs to grow up.  Flunking out of college because he was only there to party or hang with his stepbrother shows he is not mature enough to be in college.", "Sounds like some parenting issue there.

We get along mostly but never had the same friend group - like 15 year olds do not want 12 year olds to tag along.

Poor Vincent, though, I've seen a lot of kids like this where their parents blow up this big close sibling relationship with an elder sibling who bolts the first chance they get. It hurts like hell and can be incredibly traumatic. \n\nThat said I am utterly baffled why anyone thought this was a good idea even without the step dynamic.

He's the...parent of both boys?", "When you have nothing good/nice to say, surely a shrug will suffice, no?\n\nHumans don't have strictly words for communication.", "Reddit has made me realize that any time a man gets remarried after their spouse has been dead only a year it seriously messes with the child. I\u2019m going to choose to believe men who allow proper grieving and time are able to achieve a better family environment than those who hop on to the next chick and tell the kid to meet their new mom.", "We don't know why but Jamie has the right to choose to have a relationship with who he wants. The fact that his father and step mother have been pushing it for over 10 years is probably part of the reason.", "You can chose to be an asshole too, no one is denying him his rights, merely, judgeing his bad choice.", "NTA.  Jamie has made it clear from the beginning, yet his dad keeps trying to force this on him, and someone is giving Vincent false hope too.   It needs to stop.  Just because J's dad fell in love with V's mom doesn't mean they have to bond. He's civil and that's enough.", "NTA, clueless parents deserve to be called out. Also, how much would your brother have benefitted from them living together? Would he have saved on rent or car payment/insurance?", "NTA.\n\nYour brother wasn't really asking you for your opinion. What he actually wants is for you to support his decision and agreeing with him that Jamie should have agreed to let his step-brother stayed with him. He wanted you to agree with him that it was Jamie's fault that Vincent dropped out of his studies. Well, too bad. Vincent had no one to blame other than himself for choosing to study a course that he really didn't want to.\n\nYour brother knows what's up. He knew Jamie never wanted a relationship with Vincent, he just doesn't want to accept it. And he thinks you will be on his side, what a laugh.", "I feel sorry for both boys. Doesn\u2019t sound like either one has adjusted to the situation very well, family counseling notwithstanding. But how on earth is that your fault? You are NTA.", "NTA \n\nWhat did your brother expect?\n\nJamie's mother wasn't even in the ground for a year before he remarried.\n\nOf course, Jamie was in survival mode.  His father disrespected his mother and his grief.  He didn't allow the kid to grieve.\n\nIt also implies that either he was having an affair with the step-mother or that OP's father and step-mother are the type of people that just can't be alone.\n\nHow organic was their relationship that they didn't let their relationship solidify before introducing the kids.  The usual rule of thumb is date for at least 6 months to a year before introducing the kids to each other and then perhaps another year starting to integrate the two households.\n\nVincent's eagerness to attach to Jamie, hints that things weren't stable before his mother married Jamie's father.  That he would go to a university in hopes of finally getting that brotherly bond is also disturbing.\n\nI think it will be interesting to see if Jamie goes LC or NC with his father later.", "OP tell your brother that while vincent gained something ( a father) Jaime lost something (his mom) So their enthusiasm is obviously not the same. Tell him not to push Jaime too hard because he's an adult now and could actually go no contact.", "NTA\n\nbut I feel bad for Vincent. No idea what fantasies he\u2019s got stuck in his head but it sure as hell ain\u2019t healthy. I really hope Vincent finds a new college and his own path to forge", "Right and especially clingy to somebody that doesn\u2019t want anything to do with him. Like I mean I get that the father is delusional but Vincent LIVED with this dude, he should be able to tell that this dude doesn\u2019t want him around like that", "Vincent's Mom is alive and married to Jamie's father.\n\nJamie's mother died and his father married April in less than a year after his wife's death.\n\nOP's brother didn't seem to grieve his wife and obviously didn't give his kid the time to grieve his mother.\n\nSo understandably, Jamie was in survival mode and didn't have the bandwidth to incorporate a new family.\n\nIf anything, the only person to show character is Jamie by being kind and cordial despite the environment he was thrust into at a young age.\n\nTo me it's a wonder he even talks to his father.", "I wonder if the parents are putting it in his ear", "My brother and I go to the same university but that's because this university is the only one which does each of our specific courses (both in engineering). We were definitely not forced to go to the same uni but we both definitely do not want to live with each other and want to have our own independence. Completely different from OP's nephew where he is forced.\n\nEdit: OP's nephew not OP himself", "Eh, my brother and I planned on going to the University to study different things and planned on getting an apartment together. He passed away before it could happen, but it was the plan. \n\nBut every sibling dynamic is different. Some are super close and some aren\u2019t. OP\u2019s nephew doesn\u2019t have a sibling relationship with his step brother at all, so I\u2019d say it shouldn\u2019t even be grouped in!", "I suspect that your brother and April are mostly responsible for Vincent expecting to have a big connection to Jamie. They've been telling him for 15 years that Jamie will come around, and will start accepting him as a brother and being close with him. They've set Vincent up for this massive disappointment by continually insisting that the brother relationship would eventually develop.\n\nThat they encouraged and allowed Vincent to go to a university that was not well-suited for him just because they thought they could guilt-trip Jamie into letting Vincent live with him is not only delusional, it's outright sabotaging their son's education and potential career. What a parenting fail.\n\nJust wait 'til Jamie gets married and Vincent is not asked to be a groomsman and April is not asked to do a mother-son dance. This is going to be an ongoing nightmare. Hopefully you're in a position to be emotionally-supportive to your older nephew going forward, because your brother sure as hell won't do it.", "My comment was meant to illustrate what I suspect the brother is thinking. I don't think Jamie did anything wrong here. It doesn't sound like he was ever mean or cruel.", "Yup", "Completely agree. The comment was directed toward the theory of why the brother is being nasty to OP. Neither OP or Jamie did anything wrong here. The parents did not listen to Jamie. And even if the kids did have a good relationship letting Vincent pick a school that did not even have his preferred course of study because the other kid was there is bonkers. That's an unhealthy level of neediness.", "I must have really failed in my communication skills today. Everyone took this to be what I think rather that what I think the brother is thinking. I believe that's how the brother feels and instead of doing introspection or therapy he is taking it out on OP."]}
