But I wold recommend, that you or a close family member travels down with her, to make sure she gets there safely.", "What's wrong with sending her to her parents in Mexico? She wants to be there, why is that controversial?", "NTA \n\nI'd leave the door open to her tho. \n\nShe's 12. You cannot expect her to be rational sure, you can expect her to know her behaviour isn't on, she knows it however it seems the consequences don't matter to her. \n\nYou've already tried what you can. You need to sit her down and explain, she's going home to her parents as that is where she wants to be. If she pushes back, explain she is going like it or not and has the opportunity to come back, if she can be respectful. \n\nShe thinks she's been abandoned. She feels unwanted by those supposed to want her more then anything on this earth. She feels thrown aside and left behind. All the love in the world you give her won't make a difference right now, she wants it from the 2 people she sees as abandoning her. \n\nLook at the future in her eyes. That's the future plan of someone who feels worthless, useless and like regardless of what they do, they don't matter so why bother? \n\nLeave the door open, but you cannot keep her if she's not only a risk to others, but herself.

She perceives this correctly.  Perhaps they left her with you with the best of intentions and because she genuinely has better opportunities in the USA, but they're still gone and it's affecting her profoundly.  \n\nI think you absolutely did the right thing in sending her back to live with her parents for her own sake.

Bravo!\n\nNTA", "NAH\n\nthis is a tough situation. yes, the USA has a lot of \"opportunities\" but a lot of those are barricaded due to racial or socioeconomic status. even if she might not read them, send her off with some books about anti-imperialism or saving the rainforest or class equality. who knows, she might change the world just from getting to see such a drastic change in perspective.", "NTA, I've seen a similar issue play out before.

It seems like you did everything you could, but it's clear that you cannot take a responsibility for her safety when she doesn't listen, and is a danger to herself and the younger kids. You don't really have any other choice here.\n\n\nThat aside, I will leave this just in the case: you might have focused on the wrong angle when looking for the source of her issues. I mean, it's a sure thing that being \"left\" by her parents affects her, but, if the therapy doesn't go anywhere, it might be good to look for a different angle, or even a different therapist. For example, I would guess that she felt a huge pressure to be good and successful in order for her stay to make sense, and is acting out to get rid of it. She might be accustomed to a stricter punishments, perhaps the physical ones. Maybe some resources about rising adopted children would be useful, or a therapist that specializes in working with children and teens with a complicated past. There might also have been other, unrelated components to her agression.", "NTA.

This is what the living situation will be like. This is what happens.\n\nThere are multiple reasons her parents left mexico. I've read through enough of the applications from the illegal immigrants stuck at the border to know that women and girls run because they can become a statistic.

It's something that's recommended to most adoptive parents in the UK. And you are essentially an adoptive parent now.\n\nParental separation is always traumatic.
