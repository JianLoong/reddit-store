Your sister is technically correct, in that these are her rules, so I wouldn't cross them, because she also sounds unhinged. An extra $10 does not seem unreasonable, especially as a one-off, so to me it is bizarre that she would make such a big deal out of book. BOOKS! But don't argue, just know that even her daughter knows what's up and you can just trade her the other books out when she finishes the first.", "As a parent, I never turn down books for my child. And it\u2019s not like you bought her a $100 gift. I guess you could have asked ahead of time, but I think your sister overreacted. NTA.", "NTA With inflation, she needs to adjust hers.", "NTA. Tell her that\u2019s the price adjusted for inflation", "I get it, she is the boss.  And I agree with her idea - your child shouldn't expect crazy expensive gifts.  And maybe she has a bunch of books already.  (Don't come for me y'all, I'm just trying here)\n\nIt is still rather unhinged to make you return/keep books.  Books!!  And it isn't like you gave her a wildly expensive book set.  Might be a touch sensitive there....\n\nNTA in general, but maybe I get that your sister gets to make the rules.", "NTA - the fact that your niece loves to read should be encouraged, books can also be shared with siblings", "NTA. Your sister is crazy. $25 instead of $15?! Also, why not let her keep 2 books since that is closer to $15?\n\nKeep the other 2 books & you have a Christmas gift & next year's birthday gift! Depending on your relationship with your niece, maybe you can hint to her that the other 2 books will be coming so she doesn't end up buying them for herself before then.", "NTA. Your sister needs to chill. The most she should have said was to not exceed her limit again. Making you take back books from the set is deranged.\n\nAnd considering inflation, this rule is actually a burden on you.", "NTA \n$10-$15 got you more of a gift 6 years ago. Also it\u2019s books.", "Nta, but why did you tell her how much it was? \nYou could've gotten them on sale for all she knows", "NTA. There's inflation and everything. I think your sister is being too strict.", "ESH\n\nYour sister is right, it is her parental boundary and you shouldn\u2019t have crossed it. You could have asked your sister if the budget had been revised over time or if she was ok with a \u201cmore expensive\u201d gift since it\u2019s a set\n\nYour sister shouldn\u2019t have made you return the other two. Except\u2026.that leads me to believe this isn\u2019t the first time you\u2019ve crossed a boundary and it was more of a \u201cfinal straw\u201d", "ESH $10-$15 is a very low budget for gifts. However, you also should've checked with your sister before going against the rule.", "Why didn't you just call and double check?\n\nAlso YTA because even if you had good intentions, by not telling Sofia you were spending more $, you likely got a notably bigger gift for Sally than Sofia did, which may leave Sally under a certain impression.\n\nPlus Ana is allowed to decide something like that as a parent. She knows her kid better than you.", "I guess I have to say ESH. It really is ridiculous for $10-15 these days especially with the price increases over the last few years. My grandparents used to send us $10-20 dollars for our birthdays 35 years ago, but you should have checked with her before just going off and spending what you knew was against the rules. If you'd explained your reasoning in a constructive way, she very well may have agreed and allowed it, but you didn't give her the chance.", "Moms setting rules and expectations for their kids is natural and regardless of what anyone\u2019s opinion is of those, you should\u2019ve respected that by at least asking first. Maybe your sister might\u2019ve even considered raising the dollar amount if you\u2019d given her a chance. Instead she had to try to reset the boundary you crossed in front of her kid, by giving a couple of books back. Doesn\u2019t sound like she lost her cool or anything.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Sis should lighten up a bit, but I wouldn\u2019t press it too much.", "With inflation $25 is probably less than $15 was six years ago, you are NTA, your sister is.  But also, how did she know the cost?", "NTA Ok I was seriously expecting something very expensive and \u201clook at me\u201d sort of gift. Yea you could\u2019ve checked with her instead of assuming f but the gift wasn\u2019t unreasonable or overly expensive.", "Good grief. Your sister should be appreciative that her daughter likes to read and got books. NTA.", "NTA, you meant well and they are books!!! \n\nBut your sister is within her rights as a parent to set her daughter's expectations of gifts as well. She probably is being frugal and don't want her kids used to getting 'expensive' presents. While we are looking at the gift as 'but it's books', she probably looked at it in a monetary value.", "NAH You made a reasonably assumed adjustment, and when she told you no you corrected it.\n\nNow don't get me wrong I don't *agree* with her rule because $25 is reasonable for a teenager. But she could have reasons for said rule involving her own finances.", "NTA\n\nWhy not just give her stuff at other times? Or does your sister have a \"No gifts except at birthday and Christmas policy\" too?", "NTA. People hate it when somebody is kind to somebody else. No good deed goes unpunished you know.", "Things need to keep up with inflation. \n\nNTA", "And quite honestly $10-15 doesn\u2019t go very far six years later.", "NTA, your sister needs to read up about inflation.", "And you had a 35 percent off coupon", "Honestly tucking this rule into my back pocket for use with my kids.

Lots of people will remove the price stickers from gift books, but not think to black out the printed price with a Sharoie.\n\nAlso, it's pretty unusual for a boxed set to be under $15, so the girl's mom would have been suspicious anyway, and it's not hard to find the price of stuff online.\n\nBut OP should have either just taken the second and third books home and given them as gifts on other occasions (hey, Xmas will be here soon!), or said she was just lending them to the kid.", "15 in 2017 is now about 18.50, so she should have been allowed to keep two of the books.", "My dad\u2019s family used to drive my parents nuts for this reason. They\u2019d give me so many more presents than anyone else could afford to to the point that it became awkward and embarrassing. They\u2019d rock up to ordinary catch-ups (not just birthdays and christmases) with an entire Santa sack full of presents just for me. Sometimes, they\u2019d even buy the same thing for me my parents did and demand that my parents return what they had bought and buy something else. \n\nEventually my parents put their foot down when it became clear that I\u2019d started to look forward to seeing my grandparents for the gifts, not because I wanted to see them (this does not reflect on me as an adult, I was like eight and every visit was like Christmas)."]}
