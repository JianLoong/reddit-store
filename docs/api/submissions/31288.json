{"id": 31288, "submission_id": "17z15cp", "title": "AITA for refusing to share my inheritance with my dad and brother after discovering a family secret?", "selftext": "  \n**My grandma (dad's mom) left me (27F) my dad's (52M) portion of her inheritance but left him and my brother (30M) nothing.**   \n**For context, me and my brother have never met my grandad. According to my dad, he and his father had a very toxic relationship. After my dad and my mom (49F) met they started dating at university and they had my brother. My parents then got married which made my grandad stop talking to my dad. A couple of years later had me and we've been living happily ever after. After my grandad died, my dad began to spend more time with his mom. We got to also spend more time with her and we even spent the Christmas holidays at their house. She was this sweet old lady who just loved us so much. Her energy was so electric and contagious. I won't lie when I say that Christmas as a teenager were my most cherished times.** \n\n**Sadly my grandma passed away last year. After her funeral, I and my two aunties were called to speak to a lawyer. She died with a house worth more than \u00a3500K (for context she lived near Oxford) to her name, and over \u00a3200K worth of cash and other heirlooms. When we went through the inheritance, the lawyer explained that she divided it into three equal parts. It was between her two daughters and me, who got my dad's share of the inheritance. She left her son nothing. When my dad found out, he protested and asked how was that possible but I wasn't too concerned.** \n\n**During the proceedings, my grandma's lawyer who was in charge of the inheritance, gave me a letter written by her a year ago. In this letter, to be read after her death, she explained that her husband (my grandad) had disowned my dad completely. This is because my dad is not my brother's actual father as he's a child from a relationship my mom had previously. My dad met my mom when she was pregnant with my brother. My grandparents, my grandad, in particular, thought this was extremely weird. He did not approve of this and was vehemently against it. My dad didn't listen and married my mom a year after my brother was born, which prompted my grandad to excommunicate him for good. During the years my grandma stayed in contact with my dad but we (my brother and I) did not meet her until after my grandad died. The thing is, neither my brother nor I knew that my dad wasn't his biological father.** \n\n**A day later, my dad called me to discuss the inheritance but I didn't want to meet him. He doesn't know that I know and I don't know how to tell him I know. I haven't received any money yet but based on this I feel like I will not share it. My family are understandably calling me greedy but I just don't really trust them anymore.

Your grandma had a clear reason for what she did, so it's not like there's any \"funny business\" that would make her will invalid.\n\nSecondly, it sounds like you are struggling with the info your grandma shared, and that's completely fair because it's a lot! I have some thoughts. What your Dad did, choosing your Mom even though she was already pregnant, and raising your brother as his own so well that you never even suspected \u2014 that is an amazing act of love! I understand that it pissed off your Grandpa, but from my perspective your Dad is a real hero here, loyal to your Mom and loyal to your brother. I would hate it if you came out of this blaming your Dad or blaming your brother, neither of whom did anything wrong. I think it's really sweet that your Dad and Grandma managed to reestablish their relationship after your Grandpa died.\n\nShould you tell? I don't know. In general, my instinct is that secrets fester.  Now that you know this, it's going to be hard for you to hide your strong feelings. Also, keep in mind that everyone in your family knows, at this point, except your brother. Raising the topic might be hard, but re-read my previous paragraph about what a loyal hero your Dad. He loved your brother because he **chose** your brother, along with your mother. I kind of feel like your brother deserves to know.\n\nFinally, you don't need to decide about the money right away. Your Grandma dropped a crazy amount of information on you, and it's completely reasonable for you to want a while to process. You could even tell them that. As a general rule, when you get a big chunk of money, there is no hurry. You can leave it in cash for a while. You can invest it in safe mutual funds (I like Vanguard.) No harm in letting it sit for a year or two or three while you figure things out. People who are all excited to do something right away typically make bad decisions.", "WIBTA because what your grandparents did was weird and not just. Your father did a very selfless thing - he married a woman he loved even if she was pregnant by another man. He then brought up your brother as his own, which is also the right thing to do. Why your grandparents disowned him for that is beyond me. Nothing of the above is your father's or your brother's fault.\n\nYou are legally entitled to have the entire inheritance, but if you keep it whole for yourself, it is very likely you will lose your family over it. Is it worth that for you?", "Legally you are in the clear it sounds like.\n\nbut honestly, yeah bit of an AH.\n\nWhat your grandfather/grandmother did was sh\\*tty.  Your father chose your brother as his son/family.  Your Grandfather clearly has a \"blood is all\" attitude. That sucks.  \n\nHe doesn't get to choose your father's family for him.  You seem honestly all about the money.  I hope it makes a good replacement for a relationship with father and brother.\n\nAlso No don't tell your brother.  Have a private talk with your father, that you now know.  It is his decision(and your mother's) to tell him, not yours.  You don't know the circumstances of your brother's conception OR why it's been kept a secret(you don't even know if your brother was told at some point but that you were not told).", "Your dad committed decades of his life and the required resources towards a selfless act, and you wanna turn around and make it about you and your feelings? Wtf? Yta.", "YTA\n\nYour grandfather wasn't weird, he was cruel, resulting in fracturing his own family and not having a relationship with his son and grandchildren. He was an asshole.\n\nYour grandma made a conscious choice to continue that cruelty, causing pain and strife from beyond the grave. She was also an asshole.\n\nNow it's your turn to choose. You can continue a legacy of rejection for some money and damage your relationship with your father, brother, and probably mother. Or, you can choose to act with the love, generosity, and acceptance that neither of your grandparents possessed. You can decide to follow in their asshole footsteps or not.\n\nYour brother is as much your dad's child as you are. Look at what denying this simple fact did to your grandfather's family. Look at the years of joy he and Grandma could have had with their grandchildren that were thrown away over bullshit blood ties. \n\nWhat do you want the next few years to look like? Think about it real hard.", "YTA Don't you think your Dad has been punished enough already? \n\nHis parents disowned him for marrying your mum.\n\nIf they had had their way, you wouldn't exist.\n\nThat nice old lady you loved let her husband stop her from spending time with you, her grandchild, and your dad, her son.  \n\nYou have no knowledge about your brother's bio father.  You need to know that it could be a nasty surprise.  Its entirely possible your mum was raped for example.  \n\nIt sounds like your Dad really stepped up for your mum and your brother and lost his mum in the process.  \n\nYou would be TA if you let money destroy your relationship with your parents and your brother.  \n\nMorally your Grandparents were in the wrong.", "YTA. You sound like you're judging your dad the same way his parents did. He's a good man who stepped up and loves your brother like a son. If you lose your family over this you'll deserve it.", "So your dad raised your brother as his own despite not being bio dad. But then because of how \u201cweird\u201d it was, his father gives him the shaft and then his mother  follows suit years later. Did I read that right? Your grandparents have the right to to feel the way they did about your dad marrying your mom, but why you would adopt their attitudes is beyond me unless you\u2019re using that as reason to not share your inheritance with him or your brother. Of course What you do with your inheritance is absolutely you\u2019re right But if your dad raised you well and your brother did nothing wrong to you then yes you\u2019re being greedy. You have the right to be greedy but just call it what it is, YTA. I\u2019ve seen this before where adoptive parents don\u2019t tell a child whom they love and raise as their own, that they aren\u2019t biologically related. Yes it\u2019s a lie and one that violates your right to know something so fundamental about yourself, but not one made out of malice. IMHO this is something to be talked about, your anger is warranted but don\u2019t you feel some amount of appreciation too? Punishing your dad for it doesn\u2019t check out and definitely punishing your brother, who truly is the one who was dealt a bigger blow here, is a weird move too.", "YTA\n\nYour grandparents were horrible. If it\u2019s not a blood connection, it doesn\u2019t matter to them. Is that the kind of person you want to be?", "I mean, you\u2019re entitled to do whatever you want with your inheritance but the fact that your grandparents disinherited your dad because he acted like a stand up dude makes them massive assholes. Congrats on your asshole money.", "YTA. Your dad stepped up and raised another man\u2019s kid. He had no issues with that. Why is that any of your business? He did nothing wrong but be a stand up guy. You don\u2019t want to share, that\u2019s fine. You don\u2019t have too. But say it\u2019s because of this reason.  Admit you just don\u2019t want too and be honest.  Your aunts can share with him.", "YTA, a little. You don't have to share the inheritance, of course. But your reasoning and theirs is the weird AH thing. \n\nYou talk nice about your grandma, as if trying to let us know it's not just about money but the connection and love you had.\n\nBut answer me this... would your grandma have continued to show you the same love if it come out when you were (lets say) 20 that your dad shot blanks and your mom got pregnant by another guy again? I think her love and money would have disappeared. Those lovely Christmas? Who cares, you ain't blood. Because she spent those same Christmases with your brother and never came to love him. \n\nSuch horrible people. Stop making excuses and just tell us you want the money.", "Ehhh... I'm gonna go NAH on this one but leaning Y-T-A. Have you stopped to think about the fact that this money comes from people who tried to manipulate your father into not being with your mother? And if they had succeeded, you wouldn't even be here? \n\nI would just stop and really give some thought to the situation, what they tried to do, your current relationships and how you want to proceed.", "Wow, so many layers here.\n\nYour dad stepped up and was a hero to your mom and brother. Your grandfather sucks for holding that against him. Grandma too for supporting him. Unless there are more details, this is crappy.\n\nAs for OP, your grandparents had very specific wishes and you would be right to keep your inheritance. Your dad manned up when his parents didn't support him before, he should be prepared to do it again. NTA.", "What a cruel thing your grandparents did, to leave just you the inheritance in order to alienate you from your family with their money. It makes me wonder if this was their long game, finding a way to bust up your Dad's decision to show unconditional love to the woman he chose. What you decide to do, is up to you but I hope you break this cycle of bitterness and hatred. Please take time to think on it.", "MORE INFO NEEDED:\n\nIt was not 'weird'. Your father did an amazing, selfless thing. Your grandparents were not 'weird' they were incredibly cruel.\n\nDid you get along with your brother growing up? Was he selfish, or mean? Did he bully you?\n\n Were your parents good to you? Did you ever feel like there was blatant favoritism towards your brother, or were you treated fairly and equally by your parents? \n\nWhen you spent your teen years with your grandmother for holidays, was your brother treated differently by her? \n\nI'm trying to get a feel of what would motivate you to behave like this, other than greed.\n\nEdit based on your post, I'm betting your grandparents never celebrated Christmas, your 'holidays' were only Thanksgiving, considering Jesus' background.", "YTA Your father stepped in and loved your brother as his own. In the end it's your choice, money or family. Sounds like you've already decided.", "INFO\n\nWhy is it such n issue your mom was pregnant before your dad and your dad stepped up to be an amazing father? What is so weird about that?", "Wow, your dad adopts your brother, and you are ok with the way his parents treated him. YTA for lack of empathy", "I don\u2019t understand why you wouldn\u2019t share it with your father and brother regardless of these details.    Was your father good to you?

He stepped up to do the right thing despite the consequences. This is a deserved YTA imo", "YTA. Your father married the woman he loved despite her being pregnant with someone else. He then proceeded to raise and treat that kid as his own. He sounds like an amazing person.\n\nAnd your grandfather sounds like an absolute prick. Why should he get a say in his son's marriage and family life? \n\nI can understand that it feels weird to have to talk about this with your father, but you really should do that. In person, not on phone, and without your brother present since that would be an awful way for him to find out. Your parents will have to decide on how to let him know about that.\n\nAll things said, your father has done absolutely nothing wrong here. Quite the contrary. You are well within your rights to keep the inheritance, but it does make you TA.", "YTA. Ignorance is bliss, I guess. Does knowing your brother is not biologically relatable to your dad change anything about your relationships?", "Your grandfather was an absolute asshole for cutting out his son for adopting a child.\n\nYour dad decided to become your brother's father, that's totally for him and him alone to decide. Your grandparents (because your grandmother, no matter how great she was at the end, enabled his cutting off your father) are sexist assholes for not accepting his decision. \n\nI mean you can keep the money but this is another example of your grandfather controlling people with money.", "INFO\n\nAre you judging your dad as having done something wrong, or are you actually just greedy?  It could be argued that your dad did a wonderful thing for love, for your mother and for your brother.   It could also be argued that you don't owe your grandparents anything, they're dead.  You do have a living father and a living brother who probably should share in the inheritance.  So why would you cut them out if not for greed?", "Listen, you\u2019re not the asshole for getting this inheritance, but just know you could be burning some lifelong bridges if you don\u2019t share it. Your dad stepped up for your mom and brother. Does this \u201cfamily secret\u201d really change anything in how you feel about your dad or brother? There is definitely complicated emotions involved with finding out a secret like this, but ultimately neither your dad or brother did anything wrong. They are completely innocent in this. Think deep and hard before making any decisions.", "Yta", "I mean, this is tough. You got 230K.\n\nDo you like your family?

On the other this might really sour your relationship with your family.\n\nI don't think your an asshole either way tbh, and your grandma sucks for having an affair and then not even caring for her kid. (Edit: my bad, she didn't cheat - grandpa is just an asshole who didn't like dad bc he came from a previous relationship. Grandma still sucks for not standing up for her kid and getting with grandpa when he didn't like him)\n\nYou should probably take a week or two, think about it, and then talk to them. Don't make a decision either way the day after you got huge news. I think you would be the asshole if you dismiss your dad after not having thought about the decision further than \"yeah, money.\" Talk to some trusted friends about it\n\nYour dad and brother just found out grandma and grandpa didn't love them, that gotta hurt.", "I suggest you wait and work through what you learned.\n\nDon't spend any money yet. Spend time discussing the information with a counselor (someone who has nothing to gain - monetarily or your affection.)\n\nWhat your grandfather did was a very nasty thing.

Your Grandfather cut his son off because he didn\u2019t approve of his partner or stepkid. That\u2019s pretty terrible. Your Grandmother is actually worse as she didn\u2019t cut off her son completely, restored the relationship after her husband died, but still disowned him effectively, treating him less than his sisters.

Only to you her only \u201cblood\u201d grandchild in that line because she knew her husband would roll over in his grave if she left it to her son, so she left it to the only \u201cblood\u201d member in your family beside your father, and then proceeded to tell you that it was because your brother wasn\u2019t his..

So, grandma did what she considered the best she could and left her son's portion to his daughter. \n\nNTA. Grandma made it clear who she wanted to have the money and why.

I don't have evidence for all this, of course, but that's my hunch about Grandpa. \n\nI got no whiff of these feelings from the daughter.

I struggle with this, but I honestly do think that one has a right to know one's own parentage.\n\nHere's one other thing to consider. With DNA tests becoming so cheap and common, it's quite possible (likely even) that brother will eventually discover that he is actually a half-brother. Would it be better for that to happen at a random time in the future when his parents may be gone, or at a time when both of his parents can hug him and tell him how much they love him.\n\nThis is related.

Far, far person better than her grandfather was.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFixed my brain fart.", "Different times, my dad (65)was born out of wed-lock and was raised by his aunt, and my gran was packed off to the north with distant relatives. He didn't even know my great aunt wasn't his mum until he signed up for the military at 16.  My gran would have been a pariah had she stayed. And I'm from the same area. I remember single mums getting spat on in the street as a kid and that was the 80s", "Not telling your kids that one of them isn't biologically yours isn't exactly a \"tiny\" lie ~ they're adults, ffs. Especially for the son, who may need to know his biology for health reasons.", "Right. I don't understand her OP's anger, and if I were in her shoes, I'd be splitting that inheritance with my dad and brother. She should be angry with her grandparents.", "As outsiders, it's easy to look at it as a \"tiny\" or \"benign\" lie, but it can be jarring to find out your parents has been lying to you your whole life about something so seemingly fundamental, especially if you find it out secretly from a 3rd party like OP did.\n\nPlus, it's probably not a \"tiny\" lie to her brother. The man he's believed to be his biological father for his entire life isn't actually his biological father. \n\nIs it fair to keep from him that his real, biological father is out there? Maybe he'd want to reach out and get to know him or even just get a basic medical history of his paternal family. Or maybe he doesn't, but that should be up to HIM to decide.\n\nEspecially now that he's 30 years old himself.", "A lie about a fundamental aspect of your family, that's been kept by multiple people for decades, is by virtue of those facts no longer tiny. \n\nIt *might* have been a tiny fact *to OP* **if they had told the truth**. Especially when the truth would have explained everything about the bad relationship with grandpa - it's not like this never came up and they just forgot. It's a very clear and deliberate lie. And when you choose to lie to your child for their entire life about something that is a pretty fundamental aspect of their family? That turns this from something that could've been dealt with with a shrug and \"Oh ok\" into something that is much more likely to feel like a real betrayal.  \n\nAnd that's for OP. For **OP's brother**?? This is HUGE. He has a whole-ass biological father/family out there that he does not even *know about*. He has a loving father who loves him *so* much he *chose* him even when it meant giving up part of his own family. His being in the family is, through no fault of his own, the cause of a huge rift. And he knows *nothing about any of that*. That is hugely, screamingly unfair to him, and when he finds out about this he is going to be absolutely reeling. \n\nEvery single piece of advice on dealing with adoption is *tell the kids as soon as possible and if at all possible DO NOT LIE.* Being lied to for decades, *regardless of the reason*, is the sort of shit that causes kids to abandon their families. Not because of the adoption. But because their parents looked them in the face for decades and lied. \n\nAnd here? There isn't even a decent reason to lie!", "Actually no. That lie is huge. OP\u2019s brother doesn\u2019t know dad isn\u2019t his bio dad. That is deceit on an epic level.", "Her father is a much better person then both grandparents....but i think op is greedy and will put a wedge in her family...just like the grandfather did!", "Soft YTA for OP! The money should be used to right the wrongs. I would consider this blood money if I didn't share it with my family, who have not done anything besides marry \"wrong\" according to the grandparents.\n\nThe fact her dad chose their family despite losing his blood family says it all.  The grandma may have been kind to OP, but she doesn't sound nice. OP says the grandma loved them, but apparently, her hate for their mother was greater than her love for the family.\n\nMorally I would feel compelled to share it, as they're all victims of hate.", "Which might be what shes struggling with, the pain finding out might cause the brother.", "Not to grandma.  It\u2019s her money and her WILL.  Consider that if she died without a will but leaving the letter, he\u2019d get nothing. (In the USA; uk folks feel free to drop local knowledge)", "People adopt children all the time, and they do tell", "They haven't been a young kid in a long time, and I'm not saying they're right to feel that, just that it is likely their issue.", "I'm not saying it was OK.", "See this is what I feel like a lot of people are overlooked and this is why OP is YTA to me.\n\nBy taking the inheritance and refusing to even talk about it with the dad she is doing the same thing the grandma is doing. How do you think the brother feels specifically being left our of the inheritance? My bet is the dad wants to talk about it so he can divvy the inheritance equally between both siblings", "I agree! Grandpa was a serious asshat and Grandma was better but still mean.\n\nI thought you said I was trying to excuse OP's bad behavior. \n\nI think Grandpa was a horrible douchbag. Grandma seemed better, once she reestablished a good relationship (\"sweet old lady who just loved us so much\"). It sounds like she loved both of her grandkids! It makes me wonder whether she was honoring some deathbed vow to her husband not to share a dime with their son. Very strange. \n\nBut whatever the reason, Grandma didn't fully recover. Part way there, but still problematic.", "Since grandmother only counts blood ties and grandpa went so far as to disinherit his son for raising a non biological child, it\u2019s fair to assume grandmother believed she only had one grandchild. So she didn\u2019t, in her mind, choose one grandchild over the other. \n\nShe\u2019s definitely TA for leaving assets to her daughters but not her son.", "It's entirely possible that it's something to do with the late grandfather's will, decent chance that most of the things that the nan passed down were inherited from him with strings attached", "She didn't choose one grandchild over another. To her, the brother wasn't her grandchild and that's okay. No one is entitled to anyone else's money", "grandmother is 99% likely just enacting grandfathers will, pretty hot take to blame her imho.", "Thats not the logic here.\n\nThe logic is \"this is family money, if I split it evenly among branches on my tree then its fair, but if I send it down the branch via my son then 1/2 of it will be given to someone outside of the family\".\n\nMoney doesn't care about your genetics. If you keep it for the sole purpose of giving it to the next generation then at every stage its taxed until its nothing. Actually skipping a generation makes a lot of sense, buying a house is one of the things that is mostly done and dusted by the time parents are passing on, but in-line with grandparents passing on.\n\nIts up to OP to consider how the money comes and goes, inheritance brings out the ugly in lots of people. OP needs to think about what is right for her, because this is a shit sandwich of inherited hate vs a significant portion of a house.", "Yes. She\u2019s behaving truly truly evil and OP is determined to ditch her family for money.", "Yeah granny was sneaky and shady about it, dropping the whole ball of hate onto OP after she passed away.", "Oooh. That's an astute analysis.", "I think grandma should have treated the grandchildren equally!\n\nIn the comment you are responding to, I was only responding to the part about children from the same womb being considered \"full sibs\". I don't believe that's the case. They are half siblings.", "Doesn't make it okay though either way and the grandmother had an opportunity to somewhat right the wrongs that happened in times gone past yet she chose her late husband over her son end of day.", "But she is 27 and dad is 52, so in THAT generation meeting and marrying someone with a child is perfectly normal.  The Grandad is/was an ignorant ahole and the Grandma is a slight one for stiffing her son and refusing to acknowledge her stepgrandson.  OP is a bit of an ahole for not sharing with her father and brother even though she is under no obligation to do so.  ESH, EXCEPT Dad.  Dad raised and loved 2 children even though his own parents were TERRIBLE.", "Right, different era. From their perspective, their daughter in law had a love child that their son decided to claim and raise, who was no relation to them. A lot of people could treat the child the same, and then some grandparents are all about biology.", "Where are you claiming that was happening in the 80s? There was nothing of the sort going on in the 80s I grew up in. Half my family were born out of wedlock in, both in the 80s and before that. No one was getting spat on.", "So sad that this stuff happened in the eighties to unwed moms. It wasn\u2019t that long ago. Now it\u2019s gone too far in the opposite direction. \u262e\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8", "I know nothing about my bio dad\u2026 I\u2019m still alive!", "Convenient for her though isn\u2019t it?", "And I really don't understand why OP is mad at dad but makes no mention if being angry with their mom.  It was their mom who got pregnant and had the brother and her mom's secret to tell imo, not dad's.", "Except why was it kept quiet?\n\nBecause of the hateful shame attached by the grandparents.", "Part of what makes it \"not tiny\" is that she now carries the burden of deciding whether to tell him, and either choice is horrible.", "So because she's afraid that this might cause her brother pain, she adds to it by not sharing the inheritance, thereby reinforcing the message that he's not really family. Great.", "I have to say, I see this sentiment a lot on AITA, and I don't really get it. Legally, it's always the right of the person dying to leave their money to whomever they want... that doesn't mean it isn't an asshole move to, for instance, disinherit a child because they're gay, or decided not to have any children, or married a single mother.", "you don't know that. you are speculating.", "Can she not make her own decisions? It sounds to me like she agrees with him.", "The hateful grandparents were the only ones who viewed it going 'out of the family'. Your biology first attitude is terrible.", "Yeah, in my book the grandparents are the real assholes here.", "It seems like she tried to make it right AND follow her late husband\u2019s line of thinking but it was pretty badly thought out and cruel frankly", "Yeah, no.  I'm not from the UK, but I'm a bit younger than OP\"s parents and this situation would certainly not have been normal.in the 1990's.l in the USA.  OP\"s father is an incredibly stand-up dude and she needs to talk to him about this.", "Yeah. The dad and brother did nothing wrong. OP is TA and greedy. What a flimsy excuse", "In 1993 (the brother is 30), it happened enough but it still was taboo, especially depending on the social class.", "I agree. I\u2019m trying to understand what exactly the dad did wrong. He loved a child that wasn\u2019t his, he raised him as if he was his, and would have never had \u201cthe daughter\u201d had he not married this woman. Why the Hell is everyone wanting to punish dad for this?  He sounds like a good guy", "Hiya, I'm in the same age group as the dad and mom, got pregnant in 1989 out of wedlock, was definitely ostracised and treated badly by some, as was my child, for YEARS. \n\nMy family, who chose to support me and my choices, also copped it from some quarters.\n\nSo, depending where you're from, it's *not* \"perfectly normal\". The dad kicks ass.", "Not really? That was the 90s. In some areas in was\u2026 in other areas it was not. Hell in some areas it\u2019s still not socially acceptable, horrible as that is.", "I'm sorry, but OP's parents fucking suck for never telling their kids the truth. \n\nThere is *absolutely* no reason not to tell the truth. It wouldn't have been an uncommon family story at the time, and granddad *already* disowned him - why not tell the truth? That way, bro doesn't get blindsided by the way OP and he get treated differently, instead of having to wonder if something's wrong with him. \n\nDad is awesome for standing up for and standing by his adopted son. But lying to him and never telling him he was adopted? That was shitty, and it's gonna have OP's brother absolutely *reeling* if/when he finds out the truth.", "Wdym too far in the opposite direction? And what's with the random emojis?", "It was the 90's.", "Not saying I agree with her take, just that its a hell of a burden to know stuff sometimes and I can understand feeling frozen and unable to do anything for a moment. That said, shes still the AH cause the fact remains that her dad sounds amazing to do that. Should have been honest with the kids, but not everyone can truly love a child that isnt theirs and dad is awesome for being able to.", "Seriously, is everyone else in here taking crazy pills?", "So is everyone else", "So she is supposed to go behind her husbands dieing wish that she spent a life together with?", "I'm not saying they are right, i'm saying that is their reasoning.\n\nThe money was theirs to do with what they liked, its now OP's problem to choose what happens to the money now", "Agree entirely. It's truly sad how the grandmother just HAD to have the last \"laugh\". She and the grandfather were two peas in a pod.", "Grandma gets no points here. She carried on her husband's hateful actions when she had the perfect opportunity to right a wrong. She is as much an AH as her husband was. What a terrible way to stick it to her son right to the end. Horrible, horrible woman. OP should split the inheritance just to make sure these awful people don't get their way in the end.", "Its their inheritance. It was left to OP. OP would not be greedy for not sharing it. I really hate how people act like they are entitled to other peoples stuff.", "Yeah, but (in addition to what you said) she didn't ask whether she was TA for being overwhelmed by this newfound knowledge, she asked whether she was TA for not sharing the inheritance with her brother because of this back story (\"**based on this** I feel like I will not share it\"), and she is very, very much the asshole for that. This is so incredibly shitty behaviour - even if she is angry with her father for not telling her/them the truth, there isn't anything her brother did wrong, but she still uses this to justify keeping the money for herself instead of sharing it.", "We are supposed to go along with our SO dying wish even if it's shit and we disagree with it? Although I doubt she disagrees.", "You don\u2019t get the point I was making. The grandma left it to OP out of spite. The dad was an upstanding guy. The brother was an innocent child. She doesn\u2019t have to share anything. But, she is using this family secret as her excuse. Give me a break", "Agreed."]}
