{"id": 31288, "submission_id": "17z15cp", "title": "AITA for refusing to share my inheritance with my dad and brother after discovering a family secret?", "selftext": "  \n**My grandma (dad's mom) left me (27F) my dad's (52M) portion of her inheritance but left him and my brother (30M) nothing.**   \n**For context, me and my brother have never met my grandad. According to my dad, he and his father had a very toxic relationship. After my dad and my mom (49F) met they started dating at university and they had my brother. My parents then got married which made my grandad stop talking to my dad. A couple of years later had me and we've been living happily ever after. After my grandad died, my dad began to spend more time with his mom. We got to also spend more time with her and we even spent the Christmas holidays at their house. She was this sweet old lady who just loved us so much. Her energy was so electric and contagious. I won't lie when I say that Christmas as a teenager were my most cherished times.** \n\n**Sadly my grandma passed away last year. After her funeral, I and my two aunties were called to speak to a lawyer. She died with a house worth more than \u00a3500K (for context she lived near Oxford) to her name, and over \u00a3200K worth of cash and other heirlooms. When we went through the inheritance, the lawyer explained that she divided it into three equal parts. It was between her two daughters and me, who got my dad's share of the inheritance. She left her son nothing. When my dad found out, he protested and asked how was that possible but I wasn't too concerned.** \n\n**During the proceedings, my grandma's lawyer who was in charge of the inheritance, gave me a letter written by her a year ago. In this letter, to be read after her death, she explained that her husband (my grandad) had disowned my dad completely. This is because my dad is not my brother's actual father as he's a child from a relationship my mom had previously. My dad met my mom when she was pregnant with my brother. My grandparents, my grandad, in particular, thought this was extremely weird. He did not approve of this and was vehemently against it. My dad didn't listen and married my mom a year after my brother was born, which prompted my grandad to excommunicate him for good. During the years my grandma stayed in contact with my dad but we (my brother and I) did not meet her until after my grandad died. The thing is, neither my brother nor I knew that my dad wasn't his biological father.** \n\n**A day later, my dad called me to discuss the inheritance but I didn't want to meet him. He doesn't know that I know and I don't know how to tell him I know. I haven't received any money yet but based on this I feel like I will not share it. My family are understandably calling me greedy but I just don't really trust them anymore.

Your grandma had a clear reason for what she did, so it's not like there's any \"funny business\" that would make her will invalid.\n\nSecondly, it sounds like you are struggling with the info your grandma shared, and that's completely fair because it's a lot! I have some thoughts. What your Dad did, choosing your Mom even though she was already pregnant, and raising your brother as his own so well that you never even suspected \u2014 that is an amazing act of love! I understand that it pissed off your Grandpa, but from my perspective your Dad is a real hero here, loyal to your Mom and loyal to your brother. I would hate it if you came out of this blaming your Dad or blaming your brother, neither of whom did anything wrong. I think it's really sweet that your Dad and Grandma managed to reestablish their relationship after your Grandpa died.\n\nShould you tell? I don't know. In general, my instinct is that secrets fester.  Now that you know this, it's going to be hard for you to hide your strong feelings. Also, keep in mind that everyone in your family knows, at this point, except your brother. Raising the topic might be hard, but re-read my previous paragraph about what a loyal hero your Dad. He loved your brother because he **chose** your brother, along with your mother. I kind of feel like your brother deserves to know.\n\nFinally, you don't need to decide about the money right away. Your Grandma dropped a crazy amount of information on you, and it's completely reasonable for you to want a while to process. You could even tell them that. As a general rule, when you get a big chunk of money, there is no hurry. You can leave it in cash for a while. You can invest it in safe mutual funds (I like Vanguard.) No harm in letting it sit for a year or two or three while you figure things out. People who are all excited to do something right away typically make bad decisions.", "WIBTA because what your grandparents did was weird and not just. Your father did a very selfless thing - he married a woman he loved even if she was pregnant by another man. He then brought up your brother as his own, which is also the right thing to do. Why your grandparents disowned him for that is beyond me. Nothing of the above is your father's or your brother's fault.\n\nYou are legally entitled to have the entire inheritance, but if you keep it whole for yourself, it is very likely you will lose your family over it. Is it worth that for you?", "Legally you are in the clear it sounds like.\n\nbut honestly, yeah bit of an AH.\n\nWhat your grandfather/grandmother did was sh\\*tty.  Your father chose your brother as his son/family.  Your Grandfather clearly has a \"blood is all\" attitude. That sucks.  \n\nHe doesn't get to choose your father's family for him.  You seem honestly all about the money.  I hope it makes a good replacement for a relationship with father and brother.\n\nAlso No don't tell your brother.  Have a private talk with your father, that you now know.  It is his decision(and your mother's) to tell him, not yours.  You don't know the circumstances of your brother's conception OR why it's been kept a secret(you don't even know if your brother was told at some point but that you were not told).", "Your dad committed decades of his life and the required resources towards a selfless act, and you wanna turn around and make it about you and your feelings? Wtf? Yta.", "YTA\n\nYour grandfather wasn't weird, he was cruel, resulting in fracturing his own family and not having a relationship with his son and grandchildren. He was an asshole.\n\nYour grandma made a conscious choice to continue that cruelty, causing pain and strife from beyond the grave. She was also an asshole.\n\nNow it's your turn to choose. You can continue a legacy of rejection for some money and damage your relationship with your father, brother, and probably mother. Or, you can choose to act with the love, generosity, and acceptance that neither of your grandparents possessed. You can decide to follow in their asshole footsteps or not.\n\nYour brother is as much your dad's child as you are. Look at what denying this simple fact did to your grandfather's family. Look at the years of joy he and Grandma could have had with their grandchildren that were thrown away over bullshit blood ties. \n\nWhat do you want the next few years to look like? Think about it real hard.", "YTA Don't you think your Dad has been punished enough already? \n\nHis parents disowned him for marrying your mum.\n\nIf they had had their way, you wouldn't exist.\n\nThat nice old lady you loved let her husband stop her from spending time with you, her grandchild, and your dad, her son.  \n\nYou have no knowledge about your brother's bio father.  You need to know that it could be a nasty surprise.  Its entirely possible your mum was raped for example.  \n\nIt sounds like your Dad really stepped up for your mum and your brother and lost his mum in the process.  \n\nYou would be TA if you let money destroy your relationship with your parents and your brother.  \n\nMorally your Grandparents were in the wrong.", "YTA. You sound like you're judging your dad the same way his parents did. He's a good man who stepped up and loves your brother like a son. If you lose your family over this you'll deserve it.", "So your dad raised your brother as his own despite not being bio dad. But then because of how \u201cweird\u201d it was, his father gives him the shaft and then his mother  follows suit years later. Did I read that right? Your grandparents have the right to to feel the way they did about your dad marrying your mom, but why you would adopt their attitudes is beyond me unless you\u2019re using that as reason to not share your inheritance with him or your brother. Of course What you do with your inheritance is absolutely you\u2019re right But if your dad raised you well and your brother did nothing wrong to you then yes you\u2019re being greedy. You have the right to be greedy but just call it what it is, YTA. I\u2019ve seen this before where adoptive parents don\u2019t tell a child whom they love and raise as their own, that they aren\u2019t biologically related. Yes it\u2019s a lie and one that violates your right to know something so fundamental about yourself, but not one made out of malice. IMHO this is something to be talked about, your anger is warranted but don\u2019t you feel some amount of appreciation too? Punishing your dad for it doesn\u2019t check out and definitely punishing your brother, who truly is the one who was dealt a bigger blow here, is a weird move too.", "YTA\n\nYour grandparents were horrible. If it\u2019s not a blood connection, it doesn\u2019t matter to them. Is that the kind of person you want to be?", "I mean, you\u2019re entitled to do whatever you want with your inheritance but the fact that your grandparents disinherited your dad because he acted like a stand up dude makes them massive assholes. Congrats on your asshole money.", "YTA. Your dad stepped up and raised another man\u2019s kid. He had no issues with that. Why is that any of your business? He did nothing wrong but be a stand up guy. You don\u2019t want to share, that\u2019s fine. You don\u2019t have too. But say it\u2019s because of this reason.  Admit you just don\u2019t want too and be honest.  Your aunts can share with him.", "YTA, a little. You don't have to share the inheritance, of course. But your reasoning and theirs is the weird AH thing. \n\nYou talk nice about your grandma, as if trying to let us know it's not just about money but the connection and love you had.\n\nBut answer me this... would your grandma have continued to show you the same love if it come out when you were (lets say) 20 that your dad shot blanks and your mom got pregnant by another guy again? I think her love and money would have disappeared. Those lovely Christmas? Who cares, you ain't blood. Because she spent those same Christmases with your brother and never came to love him. \n\nSuch horrible people. Stop making excuses and just tell us you want the money.", "Ehhh... I'm gonna go NAH on this one but leaning Y-T-A. Have you stopped to think about the fact that this money comes from people who tried to manipulate your father into not being with your mother? And if they had succeeded, you wouldn't even be here? \n\nI would just stop and really give some thought to the situation, what they tried to do, your current relationships and how you want to proceed.", "Wow, so many layers here.\n\nYour dad stepped up and was a hero to your mom and brother. Your grandfather sucks for holding that against him. Grandma too for supporting him. Unless there are more details, this is crappy.\n\nAs for OP, your grandparents had very specific wishes and you would be right to keep your inheritance. Your dad manned up when his parents didn't support him before, he should be prepared to do it again. NTA.", "What a cruel thing your grandparents did, to leave just you the inheritance in order to alienate you from your family with their money. It makes me wonder if this was their long game, finding a way to bust up your Dad's decision to show unconditional love to the woman he chose. What you decide to do, is up to you but I hope you break this cycle of bitterness and hatred. Please take time to think on it.", "MORE INFO NEEDED:\n\nIt was not 'weird'. Your father did an amazing, selfless thing. Your grandparents were not 'weird' they were incredibly cruel.\n\nDid you get along with your brother growing up? Was he selfish, or mean? Did he bully you?\n\n Were your parents good to you? Did you ever feel like there was blatant favoritism towards your brother, or were you treated fairly and equally by your parents? \n\nWhen you spent your teen years with your grandmother for holidays, was your brother treated differently by her? \n\nI'm trying to get a feel of what would motivate you to behave like this, other than greed.\n\nEdit based on your post, I'm betting your grandparents never celebrated Christmas, your 'holidays' were only Thanksgiving, considering Jesus' background.", "YTA Your father stepped in and loved your brother as his own. In the end it's your choice, money or family. Sounds like you've already decided.", "INFO\n\nWhy is it such n issue your mom was pregnant before your dad and your dad stepped up to be an amazing father?

YTA for lack of empathy", "I don\u2019t understand why you wouldn\u2019t share it with your father and brother regardless of these details.    Was your father good to you?

He stepped up to do the right thing despite the consequences. This is a deserved YTA imo", "YTA. Your father married the woman he loved despite her being pregnant with someone else. He then proceeded to raise and treat that kid as his own. He sounds like an amazing person.\n\nAnd your grandfather sounds like an absolute prick. Why should he get a say in his son's marriage and family life? \n\nI can understand that it feels weird to have to talk about this with your father, but you really should do that. In person, not on phone, and without your brother present since that would be an awful way for him to find out. Your parents will have to decide on how to let him know about that.\n\nAll things said, your father has done absolutely nothing wrong here. Quite the contrary. You are well within your rights to keep the inheritance, but it does make you TA.", "YTA. Ignorance is bliss, I guess. Does knowing your brother is not biologically relatable to your dad change anything about your relationships?", "Your grandfather was an absolute asshole for cutting out his son for adopting a child.\n\nYour dad decided to become your brother's father, that's totally for him and him alone to decide. Your grandparents (because your grandmother, no matter how great she was at the end, enabled his cutting off your father) are sexist assholes for not accepting his decision. \n\nI mean you can keep the money but this is another example of your grandfather controlling people with money.", "INFO\n\nAre you judging your dad as having done something wrong, or are you actually just greedy?  It could be argued that your dad did a wonderful thing for love, for your mother and for your brother.   It could also be argued that you don't owe your grandparents anything, they're dead.  You do have a living father and a living brother who probably should share in the inheritance.  So why would you cut them out if not for greed?", "Listen, you\u2019re not the asshole for getting this inheritance, but just know you could be burning some lifelong bridges if you don\u2019t share it. Your dad stepped up for your mom and brother. Does this \u201cfamily secret\u201d really change anything in how you feel about your dad or brother? There is definitely complicated emotions involved with finding out a secret like this, but ultimately neither your dad or brother did anything wrong. They are completely innocent in this.

On the other this might really sour your relationship with your family.\n\nI don't think your an asshole either way tbh, and your grandma sucks for having an affair and then not even caring for her kid. (Edit: my bad, she didn't cheat - grandpa is just an asshole who didn't like dad bc he came from a previous relationship. Grandma still sucks for not standing up for her kid and getting with grandpa when he didn't like him)\n\nYou should probably take a week or two, think about it, and then talk to them. Don't make a decision either way the day after you got huge news. I think you would be the asshole if you dismiss your dad after not having thought about the decision further than \"yeah, money.\" Talk to some trusted friends about it\n\nYour dad and brother just found out grandma and grandpa didn't love them, that gotta hurt.", "I suggest you wait and work through what you learned.\n\nDon't spend any money yet. Spend time discussing the information with a counselor (someone who has nothing to gain - monetarily or your affection.)\n\nWhat your grandfather did was a very nasty thing.

Your Grandfather cut his son off because he didn\u2019t approve of his partner or stepkid. That\u2019s pretty terrible. Your Grandmother is actually worse as she didn\u2019t cut off her son completely, restored the relationship after her husband died, but still disowned him effectively, treating him less than his sisters.

I hope you realise how lucky you are to have the chance to bury the ill feeling generated by the grandfather by showing both your dad and your brother that they are loved and you don\u2019t agree with the old git.", "I hope you realize that if your father listened to his parents (gradparents, who you want to inherit from) and left your mum, you would not have ever been born and your mum would be single mother. Instead he opposed his own parents, got himself disowned just so he can take care of your mother, raise her son as his own and also raise you. The grandparents were basicly opposing your existence and your mothers well-being while your father took care of all of you. If you think that your father was a good dad, you would be kinda AH for taking the inheritance that was meant for him, but he lost it because he was disowned by his cruel parents, just because he took care of YOUR MOTHER and CREATED YOU. YTA.   \n\n\nYour father is a hero. I think you should talk about it with him (Do not talk about it with your brother yet, firstly talk about it with just your dad)", "NTA.  You don't have to talk to anyone in the family about it (including your dad), and you don't have to explain yourself.  Unless you really want to.", "YTA. \n\nDisregarding your dad, who did a GOOD THING, your brother's only \"crime\" is that he's not blood related. Your grandmother is punishing him for that, and you're going along with it, probably because of your own greed. Stop the cycle of your grandparents. Family is not family just because of blood.", "NTA. A lot of people feel like your dad did a \u201cselfless\u201d act. I don\u2019t think pregnant women need to be rescued by marriage. He should have married ur mom because he loved her , which I hope he did. Also why does your dad think that his parents would give him money, when they have been non contact their entire life ? Only the grandma was in touch of late. Why does he feel entitled to their money ? Why does he feel \u201churt\u201d ? Did he not feel hurt when his son was excluded by his dad when he was alive ? Did your dad come running back to your grandma for the money or for the family he lost ? Surely he should know how his parents felt about the situation. He will pressure you into giving the money to your brother. It\u2019s up to you but maybe give a token amount and not a full split.", "Agreed, NTA for the reasons mentioned above. Just in general, the person is spot on that your dad also did nothing wrong here.", "Great advice.", "You said it so well.", "If it was a \u201cselfless\u201d act , he shouldn\u2019t be angry about the money.", "Perfectly stated. Comments like this make me miss being able to give awards.", "Ironicaly, if the dad do what his father wanted him to do, OP would not have ever been born, her own grandparents from whom OP wants to inherit money from staunchly tried to make OP not being ever born.", "We don't celebrate Thanksgiving in England.", "Presumably the attitudes of the day.", "What? Grandma didn't have an affair. The dad is the blood son to grandma and grandpa. It's the first GRANDson that isn't connected by blood. \n\nThey disowned their (to be clear) blood son when he married a pregnant woman. \n\nThey left money to their only blood grandchild. \n\nBoth children spend Christmases and contact with grandma but in the end she still only cared for her own *special* blood. Must be royalty.", "Unlikely to have been rich back then, an ordinary house would have been affordable then and not now.", "The amount that's been left is hardly 'money'.", "Curious: how is him doing the honorable thing \"every reason to disinherit\" him?", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

I\u2019d share with my sister in a heartbeat.", "I think it was a joke, what with Jesus being raised by his non-biological father and all that", "Oh shit, I read it too quickly. Will edit", "So over \u00a3700,000 and you think that's hardly money!!", "The British housing market has been rising at a ridiculous rate. They wouldn\u2019t have been rich back in the day."]}
