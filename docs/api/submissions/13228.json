That\u2019s a pretty expensive gift and shared gifts should be voluntary and not forced upon.  You should passive aggressive say something along the lines of \u201cDamn I\u2019ve never received a birthday gift from y\u2019all\u201d", "NTA. It is totally fair to look at their behavior toward you in the past to determine whether this 'friendship' warrants a really big birthday gift. I have some really good friends but have never given a $600 birthday gift to a friend. I think they are trying to take advantage of you.", "NTA. Friends either exchange gifts or don\u2019t. That\u2019s not something you do sporadically for the exact reason you identified.  I could see making an exception for some special circumstance. A milestone birthday. Loss of a loved on and wanting to cheer them up.", "NTA\n\nEven close friends won't get $75 for a gift. \nFor my family members it's 25 max and 50 every decade.", "If a friend spent that kind of money on a present for me, I would be upset frankly. That's really steep for a friend.\nNTA", "NTA\n\nUnless you have a tradition of buying expensive gifts for every person in your group this is a little weird idea.  Honestly, my first thought was \"Bo is in relationship with Alex, they want to travel to Thailand together and they are scamming you to cover some of the expenses.\" (yes, I know, too much TV ;-)", "NTA\nI would just laugh and say \"we never buy each other birthday presents\", and leave it at that. That is a very expensive gift even for family nevermind acquaintances", "NTA. You can decline if asked. It\u2019s Bo\u2019s idea, let him gift the ticket. It\u2019s really a pricy gift. You can always say it would get expensive if you guys got that started to do it for everyone, so it\u2019s probably not a good idea. If they get pissed because you won\u2019t spend your money like they want you to, you need better friends anyway. Good luck!", "You shouldn't give to receive.\n\nThat said, if you are disappointed in your friends then you either talk to them about it or distance yourself from the friend group.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Someone is able to think up a plane ticket as a birthday gift idea but can't even throw a birthday card let alone a Twinkie at someone else? Fk that noise. He can buy the plane ticket on his own.... \n\nIt's not even to visit family... It's simply because he worked there and wanted to visit again? Well Alex can keep working and save up! \n\nYou get what you receive, not literally though. I've gotten small gifts and given bigger ones. It's about the intent in the end. They really shouldn't be comfortable asking someone they never bothered giving a present to, to pitch in for someone else.", "Nta, you are allowed to not pitch in, especially when you\u2019ll probably end up paying more than you should", "NTA, 75 is a lot for an acquaintance.\n\nAnd there is no precedent for such gifts.", "NTA just say \u201cno thanks, I\u2019m getting him the same thing he got me on my birthday.\u201d", "NTA. I don\u2019t even buy my kids that big of a gift for their birthdays.", "Nta\n\nYou're never obligated to give people gifts, and the group already set the precedent that people within the group don't gift.", "NTA it\u2019s not petty. Simply tell Bo that it\u2019s not in your budget, and then if you are able AND want to, you can say you\u2019ll contribute X amount towards something else. If you don\u2019t want to contribute anything, say you\u2019re saving up for something big so your budget won\u2019t allow you to get a gift but that you\u2019re available to go out for a meal together with the group or something similar.", "NTA Just say you are not able to contribute at this time. You are right that contributing a large amount when you don't even get a card feels wrong. \n\nMy general rule is to reciprocate in balance and that includes buying food and drinks, offering lifts, running errands and lending money and possessions. Always pull back if there is no goodwill coming your way for all that you do.", "Perhaps say \"I thought this was the group that didn't buy even a card for birthdays\"", "I agree with your judgement but I don\u2019t think OP should be passive aggresive, some friend groups just don\u2019t gift each other on their birthday\u2019s.\n\nMaybe this is a one off special occasion and for some reason they decided to pitch in to get a gift for this friend. For all we know, other people in the friend group also don\u2019t receive gifts for their birthdays.", "Yep. My friend group has been celebrating multiple 50 birthdays the last few years. I normally spend $50 per person, my BFF I spent $100 but we\u2019ve been friends for almost 40 years. \nNTA", "NTA. \n\n But these friends of yours are  not actually friends if they've never bought you a birthday gift. So you should probably drop the friendship here and drop all of them. \n\nBecause unless you've said otherwise about birthdays the fact that they've never given you a birthday gift says a lot about them and how they feel about your friendship with them", "It won\u2019t cost them much more. Take a pass.", "Yep. If they bring it up I'd just say \"nah, we've never done gifts.\" And leave it at that.", "There is NOTHING disrespectful about them not getting OP a card.  They are not obligated to do so.  Just like OP is not obligated to contribute to this gift.  Op is NTA.", "NTA\n\nI understand the hurt feeling. You may eventually learn why Bo suggested this gift when it's not at all the norm in the friend group. If you do learn more, the reason why might be something you never expected. In the meantime, it's an easy 'no' - for several reasons\n\n1. That's more than you spend on gifts. Just because someone else had the idea doesn't mean you are obligated to make that idea happen.\n2. So, just say, \"No, we don't have a tradition of giving gifts, much less several hundred dollar gifts.\" You can actually continue the conversation with, \"That seems a very high level of gift-giving to maintain across nine people. How many of the group actually want to spend $75 or more on a gift for each one of us?\"\n3. I'm going to guess that most of the group would prefer not to give so much. It just takes one person to speak up before the rest will confess they feel the same. If you did got pushback from just Bo, I'd say he has a personal reason for wanting to do this and is just looking for other subsidizers to make it happen. If the group is on board with Bo's idea, those questions to the group might bring out why they are so willing to do this for Alex now, not having this be the group's norm.", "Nta", ">There is NOTHING disrespectful about them not getting OP a card\n\nNo, but it adds necessary context as to why asking was in such poor taste."]}
