Yay :( \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nFamily vacations are supposed to be about shared experiences, not getting shitfaced in front of a small child.", "NTA - you\u2019re doing the right thing. Your child shouldn\u2019t see that from her mother.", "NTA.\n\nPlus you ARE giving her another chance, just not with the cruise.", "Definitely NTA, you should be able to enjoy your vacation with your daughter without taking care of your ex as well. She's a fully grown up adult and is responsible for her own actions. She's not your responsibility.", "NTA \n\nWhat she calls fun on vacation is her behaving like a drunken sot the whole time, upsetting your daughter, and becoming a burden.  Given that, it's a sure bet that she'll repeat the performance.", "NTA\n\nIf she thinks you're being uptight about her being drunk in front of her child, I'd be wondering what she gets up to during her custody time.", "NTA   You should tell her that the beach weekends ARE her second chance.  You have been fair and honest, while prioritizing the needs of your child.  For the sake of your daughter, I hope that your ex has wised up and that you'll be able to go back to the situation that sounds as though it was very good for your child.", "NTA. Her actions were harmful to you and your daughter. You made the right decision, considering she can\u2019t recognize her own fault. Good job protecting your daughter, and enjoy the Disney cruise!", "NTA. Getting drunk around your kid is FUN? Your ex has been given the reality check she deserves.", "NTA\n\nExcept it did hurt both of you. Her idea of fun is really not appropriate for a family vacation.", "NTA \n\nHer \"second chance\" is seeing how she behaves on the weekend trips.", "Hadn't hurt anyone?? She's delusional if she thinks terrifying her own daughter due to her drunken antics isnt hurting anyone. NTA. Even more so bc it's a disney cruise. Imagine she pulls that shit again, and idk, you guys end up banned from the cruises??", "NTA is she an alacholic or one of those people that thinks they have to drink when they're going out", "NTA\n\nShe was an AH for drinking to excess on the last vacation. \n\nYou might ask if she's done anything to get and stay sober. If she hasn't, it's a big NO.", "NTA. Not accepting accountability I\u2019d never take her on vacation.", "Nta me and my ex share two kids. We go on trips up north together and it's usually with other people as well. We just act like friends but still a team. Neither one of us drinks excessively", "Nta - doesn't sound like ex wife accepts responsibility for her alcoholism.", "NTA. She did hurt someone. Her daughter and you.", "INFO Who pays? Do you pay for everything or does the ex pay for herself?", "NTA - She\u2019s an ex for a reason. It\u2019s not your job to take her on vacations. She\u2019s perfectly free to take herself on one.

You did check her ID, right, and it said 50 and not 20?\n\nShe didn't go on that cruise to spend time with her daughter.

Please stop defending her poor decisions, her reaction to not being on this trip is that it her actions last time didn't hurt anyone but thats only because you were there to care for her. Should you not have been there to save her from herself and she had been injured do you truly believe she would suddenly be more responsible or would there just be more excuses and deflection?", "She's not a good Mum if she thinks getting that drunk while on holiday with her 5yr old daughter is ok.", "Not to be harsh but good moms don't get falling down drunk for 10 days while in a strange place with their child. She sounds like an alcoholic who is in desperate need of help", "Yeah just because your child has one responsible sober parent present, doesn't mean the other one can be shitfaced all day on holiday. My husband can push the line sometimes, it's not good when our kids would roll their eyes and say ooh dad's in the pub again.", "Honestly, it sounds like she has a binge drinking disorder, which can be a form of alcoholism.\n\nIf she was so drunk you had to carry her to the boat and she refers to it as \u201cfun\u201d, there\u2019s really a deeper issue here.", "NTA So she is mad about missing a free cruise also, it seems like she doesn't feel like she did anything wrong and you are acting like a wet blanket.\n\nI wouldn't take her and if you do decide to take her on another cruise tell her that only if she doesn't get a drink pass and she has to pay for her own drinks.", "Maybe not paying for her this year will have her think more about the last trip and realize that actions have consequences!", "Also her actions did hurt someone, her daughter. The daughter was scared and upset by the mother\u2019s actions, that\u2019s enough reason not to bring her again. NTA"]}
