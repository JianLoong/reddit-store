It's not her decision who was or was not hurt by her actions. That's not how this works. She has some sort of problem, and needs to demonstrate awareness of the problem(s) before putting her back in a situation that triggered her problem(s).", "When she says she \u201cdidn\u2019t hurt anyone\u201d she is discrediting the fact that she did actually hurt someone. She hurt you and your daughter.", "But she did hurt someone! Your daughter was upset at seeing her mother incapacitated because of alcohol! I like the idea of smaller trial run excursions and if everything goes right then maybe next year she can be included again. NTA", "I\u2019m a few years younger than your wife. I like to party, but I also know that parenting and drinking doesn\u2019t mix well. Even if it\u2019s just a couple of glasses of wine in the afternoon. Alcohol makes us miss the small signals coming from children, and they need our help learning to navigate in this world. \nSo I can go weeks or months between drinking, and only does when I\u2019m not with my kids.", "Does she have an alcohol problem in general?", "You *have* to think about it. You can't stick your head in the sand. Your daughter cannot protect herself emotionally and physically. You are the only one who can. If your ex is drinking like this in front of you, I'd bet she's doing worse when you're not around.", "It's your job to think about it. Protecting your child is your job. Literally no one else *can* protect her if her mother is failing her, don't you fail her too. She will remember that forever.", "I'm going to come into this with a really honest and hard to talk about thing. Because I think you need to hear it. \n\nWhen I hit my preteens, my dad became a not real cool dude, fast. (anger, emotional manipulation, guilt, NO SA just to clarify). My folks had been divorced since I was a toddler. My mom sympathized, but didn't help me. It was in MY very young hands to navigate. And it fucked me up for a long long time, including the emotional abuse and self hatred I gained, without an adult, my other parent, to step in and tell me it wasn't my fault, and that all those things told to me weren't true. \nHonestly, I think she just didn't want to believe it was that bad, and I understand that now (I'm a parent now too). But the thing is, she NEEDED to face the truth, for my benefit. \nYou do too. Maybe that's not what's happening right now, maybe your ex can usually control her shit for her visitation times. But maybe not. Or maybe not in the future, and you have to be able to keep your eyes open and watch out for it, so if it does come, you can step in and be the adult your daughter needs, WHEN she needs it.  \n\nYou're being a GREAT dad, just reading this I can see it. And I'm telling you all this so you can continue to be one.\nBest of luck", "Like by all means get shit faced. Just not infront of your child who will just maybe remember her dad having to carry her mom bc she was so out of it drunk. Be a god damn responsible adult", "Except that she can't stop having \"fun\" even when with her five year old. That is some kind of drinking problem.", "That too", "NTA, but in the future, the nice thing to do is to not inform your ex about trips she won't be taking. You could have just as easily--and truthfully-- said \"this year, instead of doing a big family vacation, we're just going to do some beach weekends.\" \n\nYou can also, in the future, do a few \"surprise\" vacations with you and your daughter where she doesn't know that you're going anywhere until the night before, or even the day of! \n\nUnless there's a clause against this in your divorce agreement, give this some thought, and best of luck to you.", "No real big reason, I just agree with your ex about having fun on vacations.", "it's probably the reason why they got divorced and why he got primary custody", "[removed]", "Thank you. This whole thread has been a big perspective shift for me I really needed.", "I\u2019m so sorry you went through this. I don\u2019t want my child to ever feel this way\u2014EVER. i want her to know i\u2019m always in her corner and on her side no matter what.", "I do have to inform her about trips outside of the country with a certain amount of notice, but I could in the future just provide her with that notice.", "at the expense of others?", "I have a 10 year old nephew that gets really really upset being around people who are drinking bc his dad gets drunk and unpredictable. \nWhat Mom did, getting so wasted she was belligerent or couldn\u2019t walk with her child there to witness, is child abuse. \n\nAlso, divorce means you don\u2019t have to clean up after your lush ex-spouse anymore. \n\nInsulate the child when possible, sure, but you don\u2019t have to take them on vacation with you where you know they\u2019ll act like a fool and make you be responsible for them.", "/u/Round_Branch9208 is a bot that stole part of OP's comment here and changed words around to avoid detection: /r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ogrzb/aita_for_not_inviting_my_ex_wife_on_my_family/jgi7qc3/", "I think you\u2019re a wonderful dad, trying to create happy family memories for you very young daughter.  I have huge respect.  But, a mom that can\u2019t stay sober to create those memories for that same child, causes the child fear & insecurities, & then brushes it off as not a big deal, is not a good mom.  It\u2019s very generous of you to be willing to do a couple of day/weekend trips with the ex, giving her an opportunity to earn back trust, but go on your vacation with your daughter with no regrets.  You\u2019re doing the right thing.  Also, think long & hard about what situation your 5 year old is in when doing visitation with mom alone.  It\u2019s not a little thing.  5 year olds are not capable of caring for themselves, let alone an incapacitated adult, nor should they need to.  NTA", "Ah, and I guess  \"out of the country\" would include this cruise. Got it! And that makes sense,  both ways. (Hopefully as the custodial parent, you have sole possession of your child's passport)"]}
