So understand, you HAVE to stop making excuses for her.  Your daughter needs to see her mom for who she really is.\n\nYou are not preventing your child from having a relationship with her mom\n\nBut it's time you stopped making excuses and stated living in the real world.

Is this creating unrealistic expectations by your daughter about your ex\u2019s place in your life? \n\nIf you think ex will continue and be happy to share these trips with your future partner then cool, it would be awesome to have a shared blended family.

This is not the time for her to be boozing it up and partying. \n\nIf she wants to do that then she needs to schedule her own wild vacation to go and live her best life and let op and the daughter have their actual family vacation.\n\nNTA- it\u2019s sad that she can\u2019t put aside her own desires to give her daughter happy memories of her childhood but if she\u2019s not willing to then she needs to just bow out of the vacations.\n\nArguing that her actions didn\u2019t hurt anyone?

If not, it's time to do that now.
