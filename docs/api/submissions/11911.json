She's responsible, polite, and overall a good person. She's had a series of part time jobs since she was able to, and has pretty much been doing that nonstop since she was 16. She was able to get a partial scholarship for college, and my wife and I agreed to cover half rest, with her using her own savings for the other half.\n\nWhen she turned 18, we all agreed that she would pay a very small rent $50 a month. We don't need the money of course, it's just we wanted to help her learn basic finanial responsibility. We've been doing this for six months, and there weren't any issues until last month.\n\nOur daughter was coming back from class, and explained she didn't have the rent. Apparently it wasn't any one big spend, but she'd been boying lots of little things the past few months, and hadn't expected to be broke. She explained that her next paycheck was in a week, and she'd pay extra if need be.\n\nHere's where my wife and I are split. I think our daughter needs to learn that actual landlords won't tolerate this, and so we should kick her out for at least a month. I'm thinking of letting her back next month, but with a warning and maybe higher rent (I was thinking $150). My wife says this was a one time thing, and she's willing to pay extra to make up for being late. She might be right and I'm not sure what to do.", "created_utc": 1678413907, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11nbezz/wibta_if_i_evict_my_daughter_for_not_paying_her/", "score": 622, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She\u2019s paying for college and working and going to school. Don\u2019t even make her pay rent", "Are you serious? You have to ask? YTA. Big time. $50 you don't even need?", "YTA this is yr daughter not a tenant. This is a one time thing. My parents charged me rent then gave it all to me when I finally moved out. If u don\u2019t need the money then why should this be a problem. Yr an awful father. I hope she goes no contact with u. She\u2019s worked since she was 16. She shouldn\u2019t be paying anything if she\u2019s still in school.", "YTA, even a Landlord can\u2019t evict someone that fast. Your parenting style sucks.", "I\u2019ve rented and when I was late on rent I got a fee, not an eviction. She\u2019s a very smart girl and received a partial\nScholarship to college. Have you even asked what she has spent money on? \n\nHaving someone leave for a month may make her not want to come back and she may not talk to you for a long time. Is it really worth losing your relationship with your child?", "YTA - late fee pretty much takes care of this with any landlord, especially a reputable one.  Actually doesn\u2019t even matter that she is your kid in this situation, like, unexpected expenses come up for everyone- and that\u2019s why late fees exist and not just automatic evictions happening all the time.", "YTA big time and not very bright. Real world consequences don\u2019t include getting kicked out of your rental for a week late payment what delusional world do you live in? Enjoy ending up alone in a nursing home wondering where it all went wrong when your child hasn\u2019t spoken to you in years.", "YTA. Landlords appreciate communication, and will issue a late fee on the first missed rent check. You are treating your daughter *worse* than  an actual landlord would if you evict her. Don't miss the forest for the trees here...are you trying to teach your daughter to be responsible or are you trying to alienate her from you and your home?", "Y\u2019all taking this seriously? Lol", "I don't know why the americans hate their children so bad. I don't have the best relationship with my parents and I'm not their favorite child, but even with the abusive situation they did never attempt to evict me for 50 bucks, this is so miserable and low of you. YTA", "YTA.  \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Should be top comment.", "All this - and exactly where does OP expect his daughter to go, that he also actually expects to be able to \"let her back in\" a month later?? And with no notice? OP is willing to endanger his daughter for 50 bucks so that he can \"teach her a lesson\"????  \n\nI have no words. OP is a HUGE YTA", "An actual landlord who is just okay wouldn't even evict because of the laws.", "That's what I was thinking... let her pay next week, maybe even do a \"late payment\" fee... or offer to waive the fee if she takes your \"being financially responsible\" class... where you talk about rainy day funds, making a list of wants vs needs, ideas where she writes down what she wants and either saving for it or if it's cheaper, waiting a few days... show her how to make a budget- what's her normal income, what's her bills, does she pay a certain amount in food every week (like me, I know I'll spend at minimum $7 on drinks at work a week).\n\nOr... you can even \"credit\" her the rent but she'll have to pay an interest rate of 20% each month she's catching up... though that gets a bit complicated, but it'll explain a bit about credit cards and loans. \n\nThere's so much that you can teach her here... and instead you want to kick her out. A landlord would have to go through the eviction process which takes a while (a month or longer)... so if you threaten to kick her out, I hope she knows that legally, she doesn't have to leave.", "Also, 99% of landlords won\u2019t evict you for paying late once. At worst they\u2019d just add on a late paying fee, which daughter is willing to pay.\n\nHaving a tenant that pays a week late is better than no tenant at all.", "Yeah OP is a real sick puppy", "OP really thinks landlords are just itching to go through the lengthy process of eviction \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Just in February I had a situation where rent was going to be late. Sometimes shit happens. I called the landlord, explained the situation, he thanked me for letting him know, and we paid the following week, not even a late fee. Most people aren't dirtbags, believe it or not. YTA", "Every place I've ever stayed let you pay late, usually with a fee which she said she was willing to do. Sounds like the daughter has a better understanding of how the world works.", "One week is nothing. Most landlords don't even start the eviction process until a tenant is two or three *months* late. One week is just a fee (and maybe some grumbling).", "Not only that but some are willing to work with you. I could tell my land lord I won\u2019t have rent for a week because something came up. Overtime didn\u2019t hit my check, medical bills, wasn\u2019t able to work as much one week, house repair (yk, adult stuff). My landlord would say no problem and no late fee\n\nCommunication is the biggest factor and it sounds like the daughter had no problem doing that.", "Even my mortgage has a 15-day grace period, the same as the woman who rents our townhouse. \nDue on the 1st, but not late until the 15th of the month. \nOp yta, I didn't even pay rent to my parents until after college, and I'm fantastic with money. The only life skill you are teaching them is that they can't trust their parents.", "They also don't triple your rent because of contracts.  This is a really harebrained \"lesson\"", "If the daughter doesn\u2019t have $50 for rent, what the fuck is she going to do for a *month.* Some options present themselves, and none of them are good.", "Also, people like OP forget tenants have rights. Most place can\u2019t evict a tenant without a proper 30 day notice. Even once the landlord give you a 30s day notice they\u2019ll still work with you if you can actually pay.  They don\u2019t want to deal with the legal fees that go along with an eviction.", "I literally have a five day grace period. After five days, I have a late fee. It\u2019s written into my lease. It\u2019s pretty standard every place I\u2019ve lived in the US.  OP is 100% the AH. He clearly has never been in a lease. He would have to evict her lease or not, in fact in this very situation he is legally bound to evict her. She\u2019s an adult that gets mail and  probably government aid for college at that address. He is wrong in every aspect in this situation. He could learn something from the college student.", "Also I've had multiple landlords willing to postpone payment for up to a week for whatever reason, I think as long as it isn't every week. One didn't even charge the penalty fee that was in the contract just because it was a one time thing. So ya, pretty shitty", "Can you imagine this petty guy as a middle management type at some shitty little company?  \n\nYTA OP and you have zero concept of how any of this works.  \n\nI love how he says \u201cwe all agreed she\u2019d pay 50 dollars.\u201d  I bet we means me and that also means he\u2019s a bullying dongweasel.", "And you\u2019re not an \u201cactual landlord\u201d anyways.  You\u2019re her father and you\u2019re teaching her she can\u2019t rely on family.  YTA", "Exactly right. A little bit of grace is how the real world does often work. Some grace built in to leases and contracts, and some grace in real human interaction, especially when you\u2019re upfront about the issue and your plan to resolve it like OP\u2019s daughter is here.", "OP is a failure of a father, if she\u2019s your only kid I\u2019d suggest to be careful, now generations do not have the tolerance to tolerate parent\u2019s power trips.", "Exactly! Most apartments (where I am in the US) have a grace period of 5-15 days before a penalty fee is even applied. Then multiple months before notice of eviction, which gets dropped when rent is paid bc the process is so costly. This is a ridiculous reaction, OP. YTA.", "Don\u2019t give this asshole any more ideas.", "YTA. Same. He wants her to learn financial responsibly but fails to realize she already is by having to pay the remainder of her uni fees. I cant imagine why he thinks it's a good idea to charge her rent while she is going to school and working. What an absolute unneeded stressor in her life.", "Exactly this. I would feel incredibly hurt and betrayed by the people who are supposed to love me best and support me the most. It would be very hard for me to forgive someone who treats me as if I am disposable. This guy sucks on an epic scale.", "Listen to this OP!!! You wrote yourself *we wanted to help her learn basic financial responsibility* this your opportunity for teaching - for parenting!! She went half a year without stumbling you truly should be proud of her. Look at how many strangers here are!", "Where is she meant to go for a month, she wouldn\u2019t be able to rent anywhere so does she have to sleep on a friends couch or in her car or the street. No landlord would kick you out after late payment for a once off. YTA OP.", "So they can exert power over someone and make themselves feel important.", "Couldn't agree more. They are her PARENTS.. geezuuss,I'd hate to think how much I've given my kids over the years. Wow.", "Fr", "Also, in my experience, landlords are pretty chilled so long as you communicate with them. I\u2019ve changed jobs a couple times which disrupted my payment cycles and meant I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay full rent until a couple days later. I told both in advance and neither had an issue or charged a fee.

But either her friends\u2019 parents will pay for food for her or she\u2019ll prostitute herself for ramen packets. Either way, she deserves it for being short on rent one month.", "Sounds like OP had 1 too many kids", "This is my biggest concern, her safety.", "In 10 years OP won't understand why he doesn't have a relationship with his daughter.", "Right? Most landlords give tenants time to repay and include a late fee. Plus eviction is a whole process that costs time and money and most landlords aren\u2019t looking to leap right to that. \n\nCharge her a 20% late fee - or better yet, look up what the late fee for management companies in your area is and implement that exactly. \n\nAlso, maybe take a budgeting class together? Get her a book for teens/young adults about budgeting and the basics of finances. \n\nYou know: *teach her an actual thing* rather than your current approach which seems to be: I see you don\u2019t know how to swim yet and you seem to be struggling. I guess you\u2019ll drown for not working hard enough to teach yourself to swim.\n\nYTA\n\nPs everyone else is telling you you are risking your relationship with your daughter over $50, but let\u2019s be clear, if I was your wife you\u2019d also have exploded OUR relationship because you and I would not continue to live together after you kicked my kid out over $50", "He really looks like he hates his daughter, and his wife is also mad for not putting sense into his head. OP you are the YTA without a doubt\ud83d\ude44.", "Exactly. This isn\u2019t a life lesson you\u2019re teaching because even real land lords wouldn\u2019t do this. She is right to assume that a first time late payment usually just means a late fee. YTA", "Since OPs daughter pays rent, she\u2019s technically an \u201cactual tenant\u201d.

What kind of message would that send?  She might start thinking that mistakes are human or that her parents are loving and accepting people.   /s", "I'm renting right now. I get a full *month* before I have to pay a late fee.\n\nOh, yes, OP, YTA. Big time.", "If he kicks her out, I hope she never looks back.  What an AH.", "Most landlords won\u2019t even tack on a fee the first time you contact them to let them know you know you\u2019ll be a few days after, if youve already been a good tenant for 6 months.", "Yup, this. If they want to show her what real landlords are like, take it to court and start eviction proceedings. It's illegal to just toss a tenant out on the street without notice and an eviction notice.", "Also like, you\u2019re trying to break the law and you\u2019re acting like a slum lord. Def TA.", "If I were his wife, I'd tell him that he's the one who should leave.

The two people that should be helping her the most are going to kick her out over $50. The stress from being homeless for a month would be enough for many people to drop out or at least have their grades suffer drastically. This whole situation is sickening. There\u2019s so many better ways to teach financial responsibilities.", "She would likely have rights as a tenant even if she wasn't paying rent. I know for a fact that is the case in the United States. She is a legal adult who has been allowed to live in a home she doesn't own for (presumably) longer than a month or so. She has the right not to be made homeless without due notice.", "Yeah this can\u2019t be for real. Is this guy Snidley Whiplash?", "Yeah this is not how real landlords work. \n\nIt\u2019s called a late fee.", "Not even can\u2019t pay it, just needs to pay it late.", "Well, I hope OP's daughter learns not to be like her parents and never uses this \"rent\" system on her future kids.  \n\nOP would be better off teaching her by opening a Roth IRA and putting her $50 into it monthly plus offering to match the amount that goes into a savings account. The lesson of compound interest vs regular interest goes a long way.\n\nLife is hard enough with putting extra pressure on your child.\n\nYTA OP!", "It must be his wife who is responsible for how great their daughter turned out because he probably isn\u2019t just the AH in this scenario, I imagine there\u2019s been many other times he\u2019s done things like this.", "This was what bowled me over the most- the idea that he even thinks he could just boot her out to god knows where for a month and think she would trust him enough to come back is like *what?* ffs, he\u2019s her fucking dad. The damage this would do to the trust I had for my dad would be possibly irreparable.", "If she finds a place to live, I can't fathom a situation in which she would come back. How unstable would it feel to be \"allowed\" to live at home, knowing your dad would kick you out over $50?!?!?", "If his daughter can find a stable living arrangement for the month that does not involve her selling her body OP should expect that she will never move back in and will be going NC as soon as she can", "My landlord has a $25 late fee.

I pay within the week and they don\u2019t hold it against me. \n\nThere was a time I couldn\u2019t pay for three months due to having had to stop working to heal from a surgery and they still were more understanding", "I\u2019m a landlord\u2014one of my problems is that our tenants are late more months than not, but we are too soft to kick them out (pretty sure they have figured this out). Anyway, landlords happy to take late rent, especially with a fee. You are being silly and making her life unnecessarily hard.", "Yep, was late one months recently because I had an unexpected bill. Told my landlords and they were totally fine with waiting till my next pay.", "wanting to kick her out for a month over 50 dollars is so ridiculous.

Only OP wants to do slum lord acts.", "Exactly. It seems excessive as a choice period, but if he wants to play landlord, he isn't even doing it right", "Also I doubt that $25 makes up 50% of your rent which in her case it would.", "Our last landlords were great (one sold to another). We were not often late and always paid what we had when we did have to be late, but as long as we kept them updated on what was going on and paid the late fee they were super understanding - one time that stands out in my memory was when I was put on bedrest with my first pregnancy. My short term disability took 6 weeks to pay out and I was the primary wage earner, they gave us a couple extra weeks and ended up waiving the late fee. We had to borrow the money because we didn\u2019t want to be an entire month behind while we waited for my first check, but the empathy when we were going through such a difficult period was really wonderful. \n\nGood landlords are hard to find.", "I may have reached a point where the landlord living off the labor and paychecks of others and pretending they are doing anyone a favor (too soft to kick them out) is kind of funny. Like you're a scalper and people shouldn't want to or be allowed to buy up basic survival necessities for the purpose of exploiting others, but the audacity has some entertainment value.", "Yes, all his \"punishments\" (like tripling her rent) are illegal most places and would not be the actual consequence of being late on your rent. Also, you know what a lot of people do when they're going to be late on their rent? They ask their parents for a loan. Clearly not something available to her. I get that she screwed up, but lord. Just charge a late fee. It's not that dire.", "It does not! But it also isn\u2019t a percentage. Its a flat fee. \n\nMy rent would also not triple if I was late on my rent."]}
