We meet in our second year of university and fell in love and just knew it was meant to be and never looked back. I am also currently 5 months pregnant with our first child.

When I met Alexander back in university he introduced himself as Alex, it wasn\u2019t until I was hanging out with his friends one day that I found our Alex was just a nickname. When I asked him about it he said the he really hates his name and wanted to change it, however when he spoke to his parents about it his mum broke down into tears saying it would make her a failure as her son would hate himself, which is not true at all. My husband loves his family and would do anything to help them. He said he brought it up another time and got a completely different reaction, where his mother said we don\u2019t change our names as parents do it for a reason. Since then he just decided he\u2019ll live with it because he loves his parents and didn\u2019t feel it was worth losing his mother over and he can just introduce himself as Alex. \n\nNow for the juicy part of the story, my husband and I try to have family dinner once a fortnight with his family to keep in contact, especially with baby on the way. He had mentioned to me beforehand he wanted to change his name legally before baby came because he wants a name he likes and feels better represents him on the paperwork of his child and I completely support him, so I suggested he bring it up at family dinner. When we were all seated at dinner, my mother in law started talking about baby names. We decided we weren\u2019t going to discuss them with anyone and keep it a suprise so I took the opportunity to change the subject about my husbands name instead. My husband starting to bring the topic up when his mother told him he had no right to change his name, she asked us how we would feel if our child told us they wanted to change their name. I said I didn\u2019t care as baby\u2019s happiness is much more important than what we call them. She told me I was delusional and turned to my husband against her. She followed this up by saying if that\u2019s how you really feel about your name then get out and don\u2019t bother coming back. Now let me tell you this is when I lost it and every pregnancy hormone in my body kicked in and I let it fly. I told her she needed to back off and stop being a self centred uptight bitch and support her son. She was appalled. I told husband that we were leaving and weren\u2019t coming back until his mum apologised. \n\nLooking back on it now I feel back for what I said and how I handled the situation however I just want my husband to be happy and confident about his name.

I hope that you and your husband will develop a healthy, emotionally stable relationship with his parents.

I just thought I\u2019d jump on and clarify a few things and give a bit of an update as this happened a few days ago and I posted it a few days ago and I don\u2019t know why people can only see the post from today. One, my husbands name has no religious or cultural background to it. His mum found the name in a baby boom and liked it due to its uniqueness, this is something my husband has clarified with her. Secondly, for those who were worried that the conversation at dinner was bought on a bit abrupt it wasn\u2019t at all. My husband was the one who changed the topic and it was when we were talking about names he said it very calmly and rationally as my husband is a very calm man and it takes quite a lot to upset or annoy him. Thirdly, I know a lot of people are saying for my husband to just go and get it changed without telling her, however him and his mother is very close as his father wasn\u2019t in the picture. My husband says he knows he would be upset if this was to ruin their relationship. I am going to post the update seperate as it\u2019s too long!", "Your MIL is the AH for not listening to her son, but you are also the AH. You should have stayed out of this conversation entirely. Your husband can change his name without you both rubbing it in your MILs face.\n\nIt seems to me your husband doesn't care about changing his name as much as he cares about getting his mom's approval for changing his name.

She is not an asshole just because she disagrees with him.", "NTA. Your assessment of your MIL sounds accurate no matter how \u201chormonal\u201d.

Yes he does for he has a relationship with them. If he wanted to continue one then yes he would need to tell them. For them to find out afterwards would cause more damage. It\u2019s unfortunate how mil is reacting by wanting to basically disown him over it. \n\nIts good on you for supporting your husband.

Your husband can change his name without letting his mom know if she's going to react this badly. He already goes by his shortened name anyway. I think your reaction was a bit harsh (but for me understandable) but in the end it certainly did not help the situation. For me the biggest A in the situation is your MIL. If he wanted to change his name to something completely different or if it was a family name or had deeper meaning I could understand a little bit but she picked it out of a book and he justs wants to legally change his name to the same name but a short version. She's making a mountain out of a molehill and yes, she can feel upset but she is hurting her son with it which is when things have gone too far.", "Why does MIL need to know?

That\u2019s not going to happen.", "But i guess the question is why would he need to tell her at all? Does she have access to all of your legal paperwork? Why can\u2019t he continue to allow his mom to use his given name and just quietly change it without telling her? He would change it to his nickname, right? So it\u2019s not like she would find out from other people calling him something totally different. She doesn\u2019t need to know. \n\nI kind of equate this to my tattoos. My mom hates them.
