We meet in our second year of university and fell in love and just knew it was meant to be and never looked back. I am also currently 5 months pregnant with our first child. It wasn\u2019t planned but we are both super excited and knew we wanted to be parents in the future and can\u2019t wait to welcome our little baby into the world soon. \n\nMy husband has a long name that he doesn\u2019t like and asks people call him another name for the purpose of this post I am just going to call him Alexander for short. When I met Alexander back in university he introduced himself as Alex, it wasn\u2019t until I was hanging out with his friends one day that I found our Alex was just a nickname. When I asked him about it he said the he really hates his name and wanted to change it, however when he spoke to his parents about it his mum broke down into tears saying it would make her a failure as her son would hate himself, which is not true at all. My husband loves his family and would do anything to help them. He said he brought it up another time and got a completely different reaction, where his mother said we don\u2019t change our names as parents do it for a reason. Since then he just decided he\u2019ll live with it because he loves his parents and didn\u2019t feel it was worth losing his mother over and he can just introduce himself as Alex. \n\nNow for the juicy part of the story, my husband and I try to have family dinner once a fortnight with his family to keep in contact, especially with baby on the way. He had mentioned to me beforehand he wanted to change his name legally before baby came because he wants a name he likes and feels better represents him on the paperwork of his child and I completely support him, so I suggested he bring it up at family dinner. When we were all seated at dinner, my mother in law started talking about baby names. We decided we weren\u2019t going to discuss them with anyone and keep it a suprise so I took the opportunity to change the subject about my husbands name instead. My husband starting to bring the topic up when his mother told him he had no right to change his name, she asked us how we would feel if our child told us they wanted to change their name. I said I didn\u2019t care as baby\u2019s happiness is much more important than what we call them. She told me I was delusional and turned to my husband against her. She followed this up by saying if that\u2019s how you really feel about your name then get out and don\u2019t bother coming back. Now let me tell you this is when I lost it and every pregnancy hormone in my body kicked in and I let it fly. I told her she needed to back off and stop being a self centred uptight bitch and support her son. She was appalled. I told husband that we were leaving and weren\u2019t coming back until his mum apologised. \n\nLooking back on it now I feel back for what I said and how I handled the situation however I just want my husband to be happy and confident about his name.

You both knew how they felt about it and knew the kind of reaction you would get. Quietly go change the name and don't even tell his parents it happened. They don't even really need to know. I don't understand why a legal name change even needs to happen, but if that is his choice, so be it.

I don\u2019t understand why parents refuse to talk about issues that clearly affect their children psychologically. I hope that you and your husband will develop a healthy, emotionally stable relationship with his parents. If your MIL proves incapable of accepting your will and desires as new parents - and independent human beings - you probably need some space from her. I think your husband will benefit from seeing someone establishing healthy boundaries and talking about contentious issues so that he can model this to your child as well.

I just thought I\u2019d jump on and clarify a few things and give a bit of an update as this happened a few days ago and I posted it a few days ago and I don\u2019t know why people can only see the post from today. One, my husbands name has no religious or cultural background to it. His mum found the name in a baby boom and liked it due to its uniqueness, this is something my husband has clarified with her. Secondly, for those who were worried that the conversation at dinner was bought on a bit abrupt it wasn\u2019t at all. My husband was the one who changed the topic and it was when we were talking about names he said it very calmly and rationally as my husband is a very calm man and it takes quite a lot to upset or annoy him. Thirdly, I know a lot of people are saying for my husband to just go and get it changed without telling her, however him and his mother is very close as his father wasn\u2019t in the picture. My husband says he knows he would be upset if this was to ruin their relationship. I am going to post the update seperate as it\u2019s too long!", "Your MIL is the AH for not listening to her son, but you are also the AH. You should have stayed out of this conversation entirely. Your husband can change his name without you both rubbing it in your MILs face.\n\nIt seems to me your husband doesn't care about changing his name as much as he cares about getting his mom's approval for changing his name. So you need to understand she is allowed to disapprove. As an adult he can do what he pleases and should she overreact to the name change then you can label her an asshole. She is not an asshole just because she disagrees with him.", "NTA. Your assessment of your MIL sounds accurate no matter how \u201chormonal\u201d. I hope your husband changes his name", "NTA MIL should mind her own business and let her son be happy, and if that means changing his name so be it.", "Nta, idk why everyone saying your husband doesn\u2019t need to tell his parents. Yes he does for he has a relationship with them. If he wanted to continue one then yes he would need to tell them. For them to find out afterwards would cause more damage. It\u2019s unfortunate how mil is reacting by wanting to basically disown him over it. \n\nIts good on you for supporting your husband. It\u2019s obvious he cares about his mom feelings however he has a right to change his name. Hopefully one day she will understand he delayed getting it done due to his love for her.", "\"She followed this up by saying if that\u2019s how you really feel about your name then get out and don\u2019t bother coming back.\" INFO: Was your MIL inferring she would go no contact if you husband took the shorter version of his name as his legal name?\n\nI'm leaning towards ESH. Your husband can change his name without letting his mom know if she's going to react this badly. He already goes by his shortened name anyway. I think your reaction was a bit harsh (but for me understandable) but in the end it certainly did not help the situation. For me the biggest A in the situation is your MIL. If he wanted to change his name to something completely different or if it was a family name or had deeper meaning I could understand a little bit but she picked it out of a book and he justs wants to legally change his name to the same name but a short version. She's making a mountain out of a molehill and yes, she can feel upset but she is hurting her son with it which is when things have gone too far.", "Why does MIL need to know? I doubt he needs his mom to sign a permission form acknowledging he can change his name. He is an adult who doesnt need his moms permission to do this\n\nNTA, but just do it and stop making it a thing for your MIL to gripe about", "Exactly this. You know how she feels about it so stop flogging a dead horse. Change it and she never even has to know. I'd have no idea if someone changed their name to their nickname.", "ESH.  Why are you bringing this up with her?  \n\nYou know her views on the subject     \nYou will never get her buy-in. \n\nDiscussing it with her makes her think she gets a say in this and leads to her ultimatums and drama \n\nAnd then, when she reacts as dramatically and ridiculously as might have been easily predicted, you jump to your feet and start name-calling and making your own dramatic exit \n\nThis whole thing feels like you engineered this so you could call your mother in law names under the guise of \u201cdefending\u201d your husband \n\nShe said you could leave if your Husband changed his name.   That was your cue.   Leave.  Hold her to her words and don\u2019t come back \n\nNow you owe her an apology and she gets to play the victim.     \n\nWhat a m\u00e9nage a AH", "I was wondering myself when it was even a topic of conversation. Go change your name and never mention it.", "Disagree Mil has practiced some serious emotional blackmail with op s husband. NTA op.", "Probably because if mil found out without telling her it would cause more damage then telling beforehand", "Alex is not his real name or nickname it was just the name I used in the story", "If they\u2019re so close and he would be so upset for this to ruin their relationship I don\u2019t understand why he wants to do it so badly, especially since his reasoning is mainly convenience. Either don\u2019t do it or do it and don\u2019t tell her. Trying to convince her she should get on board because the name is too long just seems foolish. That\u2019s not going to happen.", "But i guess the question is why would he need to tell her at all? Does she have access to all of your legal paperwork? Why can\u2019t he continue to allow his mom to use his given name and just quietly change it without telling her? He would change it to his nickname, right? So it\u2019s not like she would find out from other people calling him something totally different. She doesn\u2019t need to know. \n\nI kind of equate this to my tattoos. My mom hates them. So I don\u2019t tell her about ones that are easily concealable. It\u2019s not worth the conflict and strain on my relationship with her, and she\u2019ll never know. I don\u2019t need her blessing or permission and I choose to avoid the conflict entirely. Why can\u2019t your husband just do it without a big conversation about it?", "I think you're missing my point.. lol but it's all good do your thing"]}
