We meet in our second year of university and fell in love and just knew it was meant to be and never looked back. I am also currently 5 months pregnant with our first child. It wasn\u2019t planned but we are both super excited and knew we wanted to be parents in the future and can\u2019t wait to welcome our little baby into the world soon. \n\nMy husband has a long name that he doesn\u2019t like and asks people call him another name for the purpose of this post I am just going to call him Alexander for short. When I met Alexander back in university he introduced himself as Alex, it wasn\u2019t until I was hanging out with his friends one day that I found our Alex was just a nickname. When I asked him about it he said the he really hates his name and wanted to change it, however when he spoke to his parents about it his mum broke down into tears saying it would make her a failure as her son would hate himself, which is not true at all. My husband loves his family and would do anything to help them. He said he brought it up another time and got a completely different reaction, where his mother said we don\u2019t change our names as parents do it for a reason. Since then he just decided he\u2019ll live with it because he loves his parents and didn\u2019t feel it was worth losing his mother over and he can just introduce himself as Alex. \n\nNow for the juicy part of the story, my husband and I try to have family dinner once a fortnight with his family to keep in contact, especially with baby on the way. He had mentioned to me beforehand he wanted to change his name legally before baby came because he wants a name he likes and feels better represents him on the paperwork of his child and I completely support him, so I suggested he bring it up at family dinner. When we were all seated at dinner, my mother in law started talking about baby names. We decided we weren\u2019t going to discuss them with anyone and keep it a suprise so I took the opportunity to change the subject about my husbands name instead. My husband starting to bring the topic up when his mother told him he had no right to change his name, she asked us how we would feel if our child told us they wanted to change their name. I said I didn\u2019t care as baby\u2019s happiness is much more important than what we call them. She told me I was delusional and turned to my husband against her. She followed this up by saying if that\u2019s how you really feel about your name then get out and don\u2019t bother coming back. Now let me tell you this is when I lost it and every pregnancy hormone in my body kicked in and I let it fly. I told her she needed to back off and stop being a self centred uptight bitch and support her son. She was appalled. I told husband that we were leaving and weren\u2019t coming back until his mum apologised. \n\nLooking back on it now I feel back for what I said and how I handled the situation however I just want my husband to be happy and confident about his name.

He\u2019s a big baby for not just doing it and telling them he\u2019s done it - man up. \n\nMaybe not right for you to keep getting involved just let him deal with it.- from experience, some mums have their noses out of joint that you\u2019ve taken their precious son away so this would be a final straw for my MIL, she\u2019d implode \ud83d\ude02\n\nHe could change his name and let his parents refer to him however they choose and live in ignorance but his parents are the ass holes here for making him feel he\u2019d have to do that to spare their feelings.\n\nBut it\u2019s such a small thing that no one is the ass", "ESH\n\nYou suck because this didn't even need to be a conversation. You and your husband made it a big thing. He is an adult. If he wants to change his name, he doesn't need their permission. You both knew how they felt about it and knew the kind of reaction you would get. Quietly go change the name and don't even tell his parents it happened. They don't even really need to know. I don't understand why a legal name change even needs to happen, but if that is his choice, so be it. Quit making it a big fight.\n\nBut yes, MIL sucks for all the manipulation and drama around something her adult son owns. Perhaps the name has some cultural significance or is part of her heritage. Just quit poking her with it.", "Your husband is lucky to have someone in his corner where this is concerned. MIL needs to wind her neck in and understand that this is not about her. She can quietly disapprove. NTA.", "NTA - the husband clearly *wants* to change his name as he's brought it up many times, and the reasoning makes a lot of sense as well. It's ridiculous that the mother is so precious about something that is *not hers*. Maybe a little far with the comments to the mum though.", "NTA\n\nIt's literally HIS name. Momma needs to mellow out", "You were harsh, but I think your husband probably appreciates his feelings being respected, someone standing up for him, and your establishing a clear boundary, cutting your MIL\u2019s emotional manipulation short. I don\u2019t understand why parents refuse to talk about issues that clearly affect their children psychologically. I hope that you and your husband will develop a healthy, emotionally stable relationship with his parents. If your MIL proves incapable of accepting your will and desires as new parents - and independent human beings - you probably need some space from her. I think your husband will benefit from seeing someone establishing healthy boundaries and talking about contentious issues so that he can model this to your child as well. (Not that his wish is in any way contentious or wrong!) NTA. I hope that you will have a smooth and easy pregnancy! Congrats on the baby!", "NTA. You give me hope for all other DILs with overbearing Mils. You unintentionally followed the advice that so many of us give to newly married young women with assholes for In-laws --start as you mean to go on. Good for you.", "NTA - While tempers were high and maybe some words came out only because of that, your husband is an adult, and he can decide autonomously if he wants to change his name. I understand this can be difficult for his parents, but they'll have to respect his decision.\n\nI'm sure he was glad he had you in his corner.", "NTA. Your MIL is guilt-tripping and continuing to talk with no action is like picking at a scab, painful with no forward progress. Your husband needs to stop talking about a name change and simply do it, or drop it. It's his name, his decision.", "Bullies only respect strength\n\nNTA", "ESH-Legally he can change his name without his mommy\u2019s permission.  You both knew it was a minefield and went on with it anyway.  Mom sucks for going over the top but you went into as you stated pregnancy rage.  I feel bad for you husband but he could just do it anyway and not say anything.", "I would go with YTA. This was for your husband to deal with. Sounds like you wanted to go at your MIL.", "YTA. I think you got the reaction you wanted. You knew it would upset them and you just causally change the subject to it at dinner. If your husband wanted to change it he could just go do it instead of making a big announcement. I don\u2019t get the big deal of changing it since it sounds like it will just be changed to the common nick name anyway. The whole thing sounds like drama for drama\u2019s sake. I hope you weren\u2019t counting on support from his parents after the birth.", "Yes YTA and it's not even a close one.\n\nWhether you agree with your MIL or not, I think you should have at least enough empathy to consider the possibility that some parents would consider their child changing their name to be a mortal insult.\n\nIn this case you had ample forewarning that this was probably the case, and you not only broached the subject bluntly with no forewarning, but cursed at her. I might vote differently if she'd given the same ultimatum had the subject been broached more delicately.\n\nI agree with the poster who points out that your family doesn't need to ask permission or seek approval to do it.", "NTA\n\nMy son told me a couple of days ago he wants to change his name.\n\nOk. Grown ups get to have opinions.", "ESH\n\nYour husband is free to change his name if he wants, but people having a long name, but exclusively using a short nickname for it is such completely normal behavior that I'm confused by this post.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
