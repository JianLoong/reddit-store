We meet in our second year of university and fell in love and just knew it was meant to be and never looked back. I am also currently 5 months pregnant with our first child.

When I met Alexander back in university he introduced himself as Alex, it wasn\u2019t until I was hanging out with his friends one day that I found our Alex was just a nickname. When I asked him about it he said the he really hates his name and wanted to change it, however when he spoke to his parents about it his mum broke down into tears saying it would make her a failure as her son would hate himself, which is not true at all. My husband loves his family and would do anything to help them. He said he brought it up another time and got a completely different reaction, where his mother said we don\u2019t change our names as parents do it for a reason. Since then he just decided he\u2019ll live with it because he loves his parents and didn\u2019t feel it was worth losing his mother over and he can just introduce himself as Alex. \n\nNow for the juicy part of the story, my husband and I try to have family dinner once a fortnight with his family to keep in contact, especially with baby on the way. He had mentioned to me beforehand he wanted to change his name legally before baby came because he wants a name he likes and feels better represents him on the paperwork of his child and I completely support him, so I suggested he bring it up at family dinner. When we were all seated at dinner, my mother in law started talking about baby names. We decided we weren\u2019t going to discuss them with anyone and keep it a suprise so I took the opportunity to change the subject about my husbands name instead. My husband starting to bring the topic up when his mother told him he had no right to change his name, she asked us how we would feel if our child told us they wanted to change their name. I said I didn\u2019t care as baby\u2019s happiness is much more important than what we call them. She told me I was delusional and turned to my husband against her. She followed this up by saying if that\u2019s how you really feel about your name then get out and don\u2019t bother coming back. Now let me tell you this is when I lost it and every pregnancy hormone in my body kicked in and I let it fly. I told her she needed to back off and stop being a self centred uptight bitch and support her son. She was appalled. I told husband that we were leaving and weren\u2019t coming back until his mum apologised. \n\nLooking back on it now I feel back for what I said and how I handled the situation however I just want my husband to be happy and confident about his name.

I hope that you and your husband will develop a healthy, emotionally stable relationship with his parents.

I just thought I\u2019d jump on and clarify a few things and give a bit of an update as this happened a few days ago and I posted it a few days ago and I don\u2019t know why people can only see the post from today. One, my husbands name has no religious or cultural background to it. His mum found the name in a baby boom and liked it due to its uniqueness, this is something my husband has clarified with her. Secondly, for those who were worried that the conversation at dinner was bought on a bit abrupt it wasn\u2019t at all. My husband was the one who changed the topic and it was when we were talking about names he said it very calmly and rationally as my husband is a very calm man and it takes quite a lot to upset or annoy him. Thirdly, I know a lot of people are saying for my husband to just go and get it changed without telling her, however him and his mother is very close as his father wasn\u2019t in the picture. My husband says he knows he would be upset if this was to ruin their relationship. I am going to post the update seperate as it\u2019s too long!", "Your MIL is the AH for not listening to her son, but you are also the AH. You should have stayed out of this conversation entirely. Your husband can change his name without you both rubbing it in your MILs face.\n\nIt seems to me your husband doesn't care about changing his name as much as he cares about getting his mom's approval for changing his name.

She is not an asshole just because she disagrees with him.", "NTA. Your assessment of your MIL sounds accurate no matter how \u201chormonal\u201d.

It\u2019s unfortunate how mil is reacting by wanting to basically disown him over it. \n\nIts good on you for supporting your husband.

Your husband can change his name without letting his mom know if she's going to react this badly. He already goes by his shortened name anyway. I think your reaction was a bit harsh (but for me understandable) but in the end it certainly did not help the situation. For me the biggest A in the situation is your MIL. If he wanted to change his name to something completely different or if it was a family name or had deeper meaning I could understand a little bit but she picked it out of a book and he justs wants to legally change his name to the same name but a short version. She's making a mountain out of a molehill and yes, she can feel upset but she is hurting her son with it which is when things have gone too far.", "Why does MIL need to know?

That\u2019s not going to happen.", "But i guess the question is why would he need to tell her at all? Does she have access to all of your legal paperwork? Why can\u2019t he continue to allow his mom to use his given name and just quietly change it without telling her? He would change it to his nickname, right? So it\u2019s not like she would find out from other people calling him something totally different. She doesn\u2019t need to know. \n\nI kind of equate this to my tattoos. My mom hates them.

So you brought this up knowing it would push her buttons.\n\nSo buttons pushed and your MIL acted like an asshole and got all demanding and put down a powerless foot.\n\nApologies are called for all around. But since you started it, you need to power up and apologize first. Without excuses or justifications and blaming your hormones. Own what you did. And apologize for it.\n\n\n\nESH", "\n\n>You suck because this didn't even need to be a conversation. You and your husband made it a big thing. He is an adult. If he wants to change his name, he doesn't need their permission. You both knew how they felt about it and knew the kind of reaction you would get.\n\ngive me a break. they were attempting to show some grace. they knew full well that they would have started ww three had they just gone and done it, and were hoping to have an adult conversation about it. they aren't assholes for trying to be mature.", "Yes and also making a big deal out of baby names. You can have a conversation with your in laws about who likes what name and still decide on the name just the two of you.", "I think (not sure) that her example was a bad one it is not a common nickname, but something else entirely they go by. I've never heard of a Christopher, Michael or Alexander suffering deep ennui because their legal name isn't the nickname . This def seems vastly different (Like, just tossing randomness, Thadeus wanting to change to Ted). ESH, obligatory, but think the name example may be misleading.", "Yeah I can\u2019t help but agree. I feel like OP wanted to raise the issue for her sake and so she could argue with the MiL", "Ha - never heard the phrase *wind her neck in* before today and this is the 3rd post I\u2019ve seen using it today.", ">My husband was the one who changed the topic  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n> so I took the opportunity to change the subject about my husbands name instead. \n\nKind of contradicting yourself there.", "M\u00e9nage \u00e0 AH - I love it, going to remember that one!", "> she never even has to know\n\nDidn't you know that they are legally required to announce the name change via 3 social media platforms as well a local news paper? It's right after the obituaries.", "Trans person here, I had to take out a newspaper ad to announce my court date so people could show up and tell the judge if they thought I was trying to get out of debts, commit fraud, etc. \n\nI don't know about where OP lives, but if there are similar rules it would be almost certainly better to bring it up in person that chance his mother reading about it in the paper.", "He had already brought it up in the past and got a bad reaction. He knew how she felt about it already. No need to bring it up and start a fight over dinner.", "I don\u2019t think it matters. If his name were Thaddeus it\u2019s an easy thing to get his co-workers etc to call him Ted (whether he changes it legally or not) and just let his parents keep calling him Thaddeus.", "There must be a lot of Brits killing time on Reddit haha", "Surprisingly I have heard this phrase before in a video game. Never understood what it meant before but I think it fits in this context.", "wouldn't all of that be a part of mother's reasoning as to why he can't change it? instead she's focused on her own feelings.", "You dont have to announce it on social media. Where on earth did you get that? You just have to announce it in the newspaper.", "Thank you for sharing that. It wouldn't have occurred to me. I did change my name when I got married but it didn't require that; probably because I got married.", "They already did though. Before the dinner argument, they already told her they were thinking of it. No need to mention it again until it is done. Also, if the mom doesn't read the paper, she would never see it.", "it was going to start a fight either way. they were attempting to be mature about it and discuss it like adults. admittedly, they should have had a plan in place for when it inevitably went wrong, but I'm still not gonna call them assholes for at least attempting to be mature about the situation and hoping his mother might act like a rational adult.", "And the only people who read the published announcements are bottom feeders looking for deaths and foreclosures to snap up property on the cheap. Highly unlikely that the in-laws would see it."]}
