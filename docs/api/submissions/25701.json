She brought up how my mom abandoned me and said I was unlovable and that I deserved to be walked out on. She also brought up how I destroyed her family because her mom's parents didn't want to include me and so my stepmom told them if they treated me differently to my stepsister then they wouldn't see us anymore. She wished me dead and all kinds of other stuff too.\n\nBG: We have been stepsisters since we were 8 and we have never liked each other. We both have issues. Her from her dad dying and me from being bullied in school. I know people would expect me to say my mom leaving but my grandma filled that maternal role so while it sucks my mom never wanted me. I have a mom figure in the most amazing grandma ever. But anyway. My stepsister and I don't fight every day or yell at each other all the time. The dislike has always been there though. I can't speak for her but she was always so angry and she was jealous that when her and her mom moved in with us, I got to keep my room and hers was a little smaller but not by much. I never liked how she treated me over that or how she'd tell her friends stuff about me. I don't think either of us wanted to be forced more on each other or punished so the hatred was kept from my dad and her mom.\n\nAfter my stepsister's meltdown my dad and stepmom wanted to sit down and talk to me. They noticed right away I wasn't upset or even shocked by the outburst. They said it was okay for me to be hurt by what my sister said. I told them I wasn't.

I said the dislike is entirely mutual though I would never wish those kinds of things on her. He was like but you two have been sisters for half your lives now and I was like we were never really sisters. More like enemies forced to live together. I said if I had cared it would hurt but I didn't. My stepmom was upset because she listened in to what I said. She felt like I shouldn't be so flippant about such a big deal.

Because I don't care. But there might be a more tactful way for me to talk to my dad and stepmom about it.

That's a lot of trauma that she's blaming you for when it's her mother (and your enabler father) that caused it. \n\nShe's their victim and you are the person she blames for what they do to her. \n\nYou're right not to take it personally. It's not about you at all. There's no relationship between you. \n\nI hope her grandparents are still alive and she can escape her unloving home that ripped her apart from them.", "NTA but your dad and stepmom are.

Tell a kid they can\u2019t see their grandparents anymore and it is because of someone they already consider an enemy. If there were a more certain way to ensure she will hate you, I can\u2019t imagine it. \n\nIf you ever want to be extend your step sister an olive branch, maybe tell your step mom that she needs to undo that. Again, with all the shit she has pulled, I\u2019d probably not be inclined to lift a finger for her. Also, it sounds like it has gotten so bad that you\u2019re unlikely to be thanked for it. But maybe something to keep in mind.", "Your stepmother was very wrong. They should have been allowed to see their grandchild who they loved and were bonded with without you.

You're right about it being so bad that I don't want to lift a finger for her. I think olive branches here are a waste of time and it's not something I want to offer.

Not the exact same but they can't treat her like she doesn't exist.", "Why the eff would she? None of this is her fault either. It is not the purpose of OP's existence to right whatever wrongs and unfortunate circumstances happened to her step sister, that's not her job, nor did she choose this life either.\n\nYour take seems insane to me.", "Not friendly. Not sure that could have been pulled off. Someone described us once like siblings who aren't exactly close but at least they aren't fighting.

So the hurt your stepmum is claiming to have now is what they have fostered and done nothing about.\n\nIt doesn't sound like stepsister was ready for the next step for your dad's and her mums relationship when they moved in, especially if her dad had recently passed at the time, to then be excluded from her own family by her mum (info: this is stepmums parents, right? Not her dad's?) Because they wanted solo time with their grandkid. Then, the resentment just built from there and came to a head when discussing Christmas plans. \n\nLiving with someone doesn't make you family. Just because parents get together doesn't mean the kids will automatically or ever see each other as siblings. I really wish parents would stop with this 'instant happy family' because its how they feel/what they want.\n\nNTA. You can't help the way you feel towards each other, and this late in the game, not much if anything is going to change about that for either of you.", "NTA\n\nYour parents caused this.

Also to say, \u201cWell you\u2019ve been siblings half of your life\u201d is completely disgusting. Maybe half of your childhood but not half of your life. Also you don\u2019t have to be fond of your stepsister. I don\u2019t like my parents at all or my siblings. I dislike them all.", "NTA.\n\nYour stepsister understandably hates you, though her anger is misplaced.  She should be mad at her mother for cutting contact with her grandparents, but she was young and that's not how her mind worked at the time.  I agree with whoever said that your stepmother needs to rectify that mistake ASAP.\n\nSo... the opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference.  You are indifferent to what your stepsister thinks; she can't hurt you through what she says because it just rolls off your back.  You don't have to be mean, or cruel, or try to drive her away, or consider her an interloper because *you don't care*.  I think that's why your dad and stepmom reacted so strongly to what you said.  They could work work to rectify anger or hatred by finding the cause and fixing it.  Indifference is impossible - you can't make someone like someone else.", "NTA\n\nyou have obviously de sensitised to her and her vitriol towards you.

We made sure to keep it from them.", "That's where your stepmum is wrong tbh. They shouldn't have tried to force a relationship between you and them. \n\nI am a stepchild.

It's OK to want to spend time with her bio granddaughter but she can not be exclusionary to step granddaughter.\n\nI think more info is needed before jumping to calling SM  hare-brained.  Did granny just want to hang with bioGD and ignore STEP-DAD?  Did she not remember stepGD's birthday but shower bioGD with gifts?  Who's mom is she?  Was she dad's mom (may be overcompensating for the loss of dad or worried she may lise cobtact with bioGD now that there is a new \"dad\" in the picture) or is she SM's mom (in which case stepGD is going to be in her life for a long time so they should have some sort of relationship)?\n\nStepGD/stepsister is just looking for reasons to hate OP.

But I can also understand why she thought it was a good thing. She saw it as being a good stepmom and bringing harmony to the family so I wasn't excluded by her side while they continued a relationship with my stepsister. It doesn't bother me that they weren't interested in me but I know they probably worried it would and maybe even worried it would drive a wedge.

We hate each other and all I'll do is avoid being around her like I always have tried to do.", "It's not your fault that you hate her, nor hers that she hates you. Best of luck.", "OP clearly had the maturity to accept the situation long ago and was just asking if her indifference to the unwarranted verbal abuse over her parents' (not her) vacation arrangements made her an A.  Clearly she's NTA and since the decision about grandparents applied on both sides there's no favoritism.  And not being punished because you behave is hardly making someone a golden child."]}
