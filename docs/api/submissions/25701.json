Not her dad's?) Because they wanted solo time with their grandkid. Then, the resentment just built from there and came to a head when discussing Christmas plans. \n\nLiving with someone doesn't make you family.

I agree with whoever said that your stepmother needs to rectify that mistake ASAP.\n\nSo... the opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference.  You are indifferent to what your stepsister thinks; she can't hurt you through what she says because it just rolls off your back.  You don't have to be mean, or cruel, or try to drive her away, or consider her an interloper because *you don't care*.  I think that's why your dad and stepmom reacted so strongly to what you said.

The pressure of hiding that has clearly taken some toll on your stepsister for her to explode like that, and on you for you to be largely indifferent to the tirade. Perhaps your relationship would have come out marginally better if you didn't feel like so much was *expected*.\n\nIt's rough that she blames you for the situation with her grandparents.

I understand the intention there and think the grandparents have to own the consequences of the hill they decided to die on.

However, your stepmother, while her intentions might be good (in that she wants you to feel included even though you don't necessarily want to or should be included) she has now taken away a very important set of people in your stepsister's life. I think this might be a misguided attempt to make you feel like she is on your side. How would you feel if your father cut your grandmother out of your life because she didn't want to play grandma to a child that is not her granddaughter. I really hope they you will consider sitting down with your father and stepmother and explain to them that you are perfectly ok with not being a part of your stepsister's grandparent's live and explain to them that you really believe that a significant part of your stepsister's animosity towards you, stems from the fact that she might see it as being your fault that her mother cut her grandparents off. Again, while I think your stepmother's intentions are good, she's trying way to hard to force the 4 of you into becoming a \"family\" and at her own daughter's expense. If you sit the two of them down and explain this to them (as kindly as possible), maybe they will start to see that your stepsister's apparent disdain for you stems from the fact that she is feeling abandoned by everyone she loves. For example, her father died and left her. Her mother married another man and has maybe been neglecting her emotionally a little bit (not on purpose... just not realizing she's doing it) and her grandparents have left her too (albeit not of their own volition but maybe they haven't tried hard enough to fix this). I've rambled enough but, I'll close with, I don't think her grandparents are very nice people. First, they said they would never accept you as family (you aren't but, whatever, they didn't have to be AHs about it) and then, not fighting harder for their granddaughter when the ultimatum was issued. By advocating for your stepsister, you could start to repair the huge chasm between you. I'm not saying it's your responsibility to close that gap but, making an effort, on your stepsister's behalf, might make her start to see you a bit differently. You two may never be close but, she might stop trying to make your life miserable if she sees you have her back on some things.", "NTA seems like parents are really blind.", "NTA OP.  Your parents need to yank off the rose-colored glasses and really see what the heck is going on.", "NTA. Like you said, she isn\u2019t your family and what she thinks doesn\u2019t matter. Sometimes, stepfamilies don\u2019t work out.", "NTA so now they are turning this on you and making it your fault for developing a coping mechanism to a forced family situation with a dad who didn\u2019t care to pay attention before this?  Did I read that right?  \nDon\u2019t let them get to you.  They are bad parents too caught up in each other to really care about your or her feelings very much.  Just one big happy family is all they want to show the world regardless.", "NTA, and I'm sorry for what you're dealing with. I hope you know that everything she blamed on you was not your fault. It's mostly your parents' fault, but it sounds like, for the most part, they were trying. Your SM telling the grandparents that you are to be treated the same is wonderful. She was doing her best to show that you are not a \"stepchild\" but a child under her care and love, and you deserve that care and love. \n\nYour step sister clearly has a lot of pent-up anger over this blended family, and unfortunately, you are the target of that anger. Hopefully, your parents got slapped with a bit of reality. SS, at the least, needs counseling. Individuals for everyone may be good. It seems like she is in need of it more and then peppered with some family sessions.\n\nYou have every right to want nothing to do with you, SS. The only thing I would say to that is don't shut and lock the door. If there is a time when she is able to start working through her anger and resentment, it could be worth trying to build some kind of relationship. But that's going to take a lot of work on her end, and I would be pointless, for your own well being, to try and have anything but a cordial relationship until you can live somewhere she's not. \n\nIdk how old either of you were when your parents got married. It sounds like she was at least pretty young. So, while you don't have to be a part of her life, don't hold it all against her. The blending of the families didn't go that great, obviously. Again, her anger and resentment have found you as a target when you are not to blame for any of the issues she brought up. She is clearly hurting deeply. She may have also felt like her feelings were ignored and that you were prioritized. Even by her own mom. So she may feel betrayed by her mom, and thus, another reason why you're the target of the anger. If I were in this situation. I would advocate for her to go into therapy but that's about as far as I'd go.", "I get you both don\u2019t like each other fair enough, but I would be fuming if my kids step sibling wished them dead, I\u2019m sorry that\u2019s a step to far. It\u2019s lucky really that you don\u2019t care because the things she said are unforgivable, NTA in my opinion", "NTA. Parents really need to understand that just because you love each other doesn't mean your kids will even like each other. Heck, many full siblings can't stand each other (my sister is not someone I count as \"friend\" - more like person-I-see-to-placate-my-mom)", "NTA, you don't have to like her. You don't have to care about her. It's good that you wouldn't wish the kinds of things she said in her rant on her. Your dad asked for the truth, you gave it to him. I understand where they're coming from, the hope that their kids would get along fantastically. It's a big deal to them, it seems from what you've said you already try hard to be cordial and keep peace for their sake, maybe point that out to them. Like you recognize it hurts them, but you do your best to get along as best as possible for them already and her outburst isn't a shock or surprise, they've just been too optimistic to really see it.", "[removed]", "Sadly, it instantly went to blaming op. With step mom listening in to her private conversations with her dad. Appalling. They havent learned anything", "I'm beginning to think we have a huge generation of people who grew up watching The Brady Bunch who now firmly believe that's how blended families work. FYI, it's not.\n\nI barely tolerate my step-sister, and we've been \"family\" for over 30 years. You may, one day, both be able to tolerate each other, but your dad and stepmother shouldn't try to force the Brady Bunch picture of family. NTA, OP.", "I'm closer to my step sister than some of my biological siblings. Biology doesn't make someone a \"real\" siblings. Some siblings, biological, adopted, or step, don't like each.", "The step mom did not cut off contact with the grandparents.   The grandparents made the choice to treat the girls differently and they lost the privilege.   There is a difference.   One comes from love the other from hate.", "I'm confused. OP did everything right and didn't throw a tantrum. Why do they need to learn tact?", "Get a therapist lol", "Yeah, that's something else.\n\nMy dad beat me with extension cords.\n\nHe also killed me once by throwing me through a wall at age 3, where I hit my head on the back of the shower.", "[removed]", "Exactly. Rather than then taking a step back and saying \u201cwow, we really should have done a better job of taking into account where people are and how people feel about this and letting them move at their own speed\u201d it became \u201cbUt ShEs YuR sIsTeEeR!!!\u201d\n\nEven though actually, no she isn\u2019t.", "[removed]", "Gotcha. I did start to skim after a while so lost the nuance/ details of this particular case.", "Exactly. Just gross. And sadly, had they approached it right or stepped in & took accountability at the beginning, it could have a completely different ending", "OP is a child!", "Actually the answer to my question is no. You can read it for yourself in OP's comment: \n\n>\" Not the exact same but they can't treat her like she doesn't exist.\"\n\nShe also said she agreed with what her step mother did, even though she compared it to being  bullied, which everyone can agree can be very traumatic. \n\nI don't think OP is a bad person or anything, I just think she is really na\u00efve and its pretty clear that she got it from her parents. I bet OP's step sister would paint a much different version of this story.", "She can be staying far away while she\u2019s with her grandparents. At the very least it gives you a break from her.", "Think of it as a learning experience for mitigating adult levels of conflict. There are going to be people in your life that you're stuck with from now until you die. Coworkers, neighbors, friends of friends, people who just fucking hate their jobs and want to take it out on everything, ect. You aren't always going to be able to move away or lock the door on them. This is something you're going to have to learn how to do; communicate, mitigate, and address.", "Depending on the circumstances, maybe. It doesn\u2019t work for the parents to rock up to the grandparents with a kid that they have never met before and say \u201cHey, this is your new granddaughter. You have to love her and treat her the same as your actual granddaughter that you\u2019ve seen grow from a baby and have a years long relationship with.\u201d", "I mean, I don't get how step sister would paint a different picture. OP is very objective in explaining that they just don't get along and don't like each other. It's not like she went about painting herself as a saint and step sis as a monster. She actually even admits that she hated the thought of sharing a room with her, but that she just sat back and let step sis blow up and take the heat for both of them. It's just a situation where both of them are just people who dislike each other. Not everyone needs to get along with one another.", "OP grandparents followed the parents rules and that's why they are still in her life. OP also Said that she understand why that caused even more problems with her stepsister and why that made her mad. OP's mom lirally walked away from her and OP didn't say that was the same as being bullied, she Just said that they both had problema to deal with that made dificult to connect.\nMy point is: OP doesn't have to Care at ALL, her stepmom's mistakes with her daugher isn't her problem. OP is even too empathetic with stepsister even after the disgusting things she Said about OP being abandoned by her mom and wishing death on OP.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "Depends on what the ask is. Be courteous to her step sibling? That sounds like an easy choice.", "When the issue first arose the girls were 8. She would rather never see her granddaughter (or daughter, for that matter) again than be civil to an 8yo girl. Again, she sounds horrid.", "They probably would have gotten a long better if they were allowed to dislike each other instead of being forced into some sisterly love bullshit they didn't feel.", "I think OP just seems objective in painting the picture. First, I'm not so sure her response was the most mature, \"I knew step-sis would freak out so I didn't have to object and I would still get my way.\"  Secondly, the fact the parents are completely clueless about their relations, \"OP why are not not more upset?\" indicates she maybe deceptive with her parents because they are clueless. Just screams missing reasons to me.\n\nFinally, as I said above, she equates forcibly going no-contact with your grandparents  to being bullied in school. Both suck but one is a betrayal by your own mother.", "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/163ij97/aita_for_telling_my_dad_i_really_dont_care_about/jy4bntj?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=2\n\nBad bot", "No, just don't bring the step sibling around if grandma can't be courteous.

OP also has had it hard and she's not responsible for other's choices. SM decided to cut off her parents not OP. You're being too aggressive and in all honesty, seems like you're projecting.  You don't have enough information to declare the parents abusive. Looks more like they both tried to keep a unity in their family of 4 rather than split it. I'm sorry if you went through something similar, I do agree that SS should've never been denied her grandparents but why couldn't the grandparents just include another child? I'm not saying love her or prefer her, just include. OP grandparents didn't seen to have a problem with that."]}
