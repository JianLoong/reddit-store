Not her dad's?) Because they wanted solo time with their grandkid. Then, the resentment just built from there and came to a head when discussing Christmas plans. \n\nLiving with someone doesn't make you family.

She should be mad at her mother for cutting contact with her grandparents, but she was young and that's not how her mind worked at the time.  I agree with whoever said that your stepmother needs to rectify that mistake ASAP.\n\nSo... the opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference.  You are indifferent to what your stepsister thinks; she can't hurt you through what she says because it just rolls off your back.  You don't have to be mean, or cruel, or try to drive her away, or consider her an interloper because *you don't care*.  I think that's why your dad and stepmom reacted so strongly to what you said.  They could work work to rectify anger or hatred by finding the cause and fixing it.

But it sounds like you were concerned about being forced together more which would have been absolutely wrong. The pressure of hiding that has clearly taken some toll on your stepsister for her to explode like that, and on you for you to be largely indifferent to the tirade. Perhaps your relationship would have come out marginally better if you didn't feel like so much was *expected*.\n\nIt's rough that she blames you for the situation with her grandparents. I don't think it's unreasonable for grown adults to show some warmth towards an *eight-year-old* who will be in their grandchild's life from then on, for the sake of seeing the grandchild if not, you know, trying to keep the grandchild as happy as possible in their new home situation. I understand the intention there and think the grandparents have to own the consequences of the hill they decided to die on.

Why are you being scolded in a way because she is bad-tempered and lashes out when angry? NTA", "Don't we often see people getting reamed out for letting their families treat the stepkids like garbage on this sub? I feel like the opinions vacillate wildly from post to post about \"You should stand up to your parents to protect your stepkids\" to this post of \"Your stepmom was foolish to take a stand against her parents for the sake of you not being treated poorly.\" \n\nThere's clearly not one right answer, but this perspective all the way down the thread surprised me.", "Even siblings with the same parents can hate each other. In the end, you can\u2019t force people to like each other.", "But to keep it simple. If me and my stepsister are both 16 and our parents got into a relationship when we were 8, it\u2019s obviously half of our lives so far.", "You step mom did a really bad thing. She robbed her child who's life was already being disrupted of a close family bond. It was wrong. I think you may need to look in her lense, that she did have to give up so much more then you did.", "There is a difference between standing up for your step child, and robbing your own child of a foundational relationship in a time where their whole lives are being upended. \n\n\"Mom you really should include step daughter\" \n\nis vastly different then\n\n\"mom even though I have moved my child, and she had to sacrifice her home, her friends, maybe even move to a different school, you can't see her anymore, even though my daughter deeply needs this foundational relationship\"\n\nThe nuance her is insanely important", "Is it that off base? Sounds like OP and her Parents are kind of the same. I don't mean to be offensive to OP because she is 17 but she seems pretty clueless too.\n\nShe mentioned how important her grandmother was in her life and how she didn't even feel like she lost her mother but in the same post says it should be no big deal that her step sister was forcibly cut off from a relationship with Step sis's grandparents because they didn't want close relationship with OP.\n\nOP - does your grandmother treat your step sis like her own granddaughter, or was that rule only imposed on one side of the family?", "Wow she is a huge AH for that. Grandparents aren't obligated to automatically \"take in\" step kids. Your stepsister should have been able to have a relationship with her grandparents regardless if they included you or not. Yes, it would be nice but not required. I never understand step-parents who act this way.", "Yeah they certainly stuck their head in the sand.", "Yeah, I have no idea what screwed up family dynamics are happening but I think the parents would be better off addressing that than trying to make OP feel bad about her reaction and trying to make her feel guilty.", "Wait\u2026 what? OP needs to step back from her own family to make her step sister happy?", "Then don't think of it as an olive branch - think of it as a way to get your stepsister out of the house, and out of your hair, on a semi-regular basis (or however often she visits the grandparents), while also making you appear to be the bigger person. \n\nWin-win for you.", "Having been through this as a child and a parent, I would consider it laying the foundations of a truce you can live with for the rest of your lives. You are stuck dealing with each other at family events, etc and it will only get harder as you get older. Laying the foundations of coexisting without open conflict will benefit you in the long run. You don't need to like each other but you will need to live with each other and see each other at Holidays.", "This sounds like a solid idea.", "No, i'm sorry but no, you don't rob your child of their caring grandparents when you have already disrupted your child's life? Yes grandma should be more inclusive of sister, but mom destroyed this kids life and took away the one foundation she could have had.", "Me and my biological sister are like this, even to this day. She's 30 and I'm 28, we cannot be left alone together or we just fight. But when we were kids, we never acted that way in front of our parents, we always just tolerated each other until it all came out at a family function because we started arguing. Our parents never knew about it to begin with, they just thought that we were different and therefore not that close.\n\nJust because the parents didn't notice, doesn't mean that they have done anything wrong, if they're co-existing as peacefully as possible around each other when the parents are there and only arguing/fighting away from them, then pray tell, how in the holy hell are they supposed to catch on that they cannot stand each other?", "She was more concerned with beint a good stepmom then with being a good mom. Her actions ended up driving a wedge in the family while she was trying to prevent one.", "Yeah her mom sacrificed her well being for you. She was being a good step mom but a crappy parent who cared little of her daughters well being.", "Have you ever told your stepmom this?"]}
