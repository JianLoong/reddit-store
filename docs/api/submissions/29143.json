Told him who when and the circumstances.  I haven\u2019t always found it easy to recount but I\u2019ve done my best.  He\u2019s done the same though I don\u2019t feel I need to know, need details or hear about them again. \n\nTonight he wanted to go over a onetime fling I had a long time ago.  He says things don\u2019t add up.  I told him about it in early 2022, he wanted to talk about it again early 2023 and now again in Oct 2023.   \n\nI was fully happy to tell him about it in the first instance in 2022, in the second instance I was patient as the dialogue wasn\u2019t unhelpful or over intrusive though I was uncomfortable we were going over old ground and clear i wasn\u2019t happy revisiting it.  Tonight he wanted to do it again.  Over time I\u2019ve lost the detail and am more fuzzy.  That makes me anxious like I\u2019m going to fail some kind of test and not be able to satisfy what he needs. \n\nThe fling was one night after a party and hardly a major event.  Tonight he expects me to recall exactly how I was thinking at the time and the name of the person.  He said he\u2019s guessed who it was.  I knew the name in 2022 and am almost 99% sure I told him it.  By now i\u2019ve forgotten it (sorry fling man).  I know that\u2019s bad  form but it was a hedonistic single year and I didn\u2019t stay in touch with that person at all.    \n\nMy boyfriend won\u2019t tell me who he thinks it is and I doubt he knows as fling man wasn\u2019t in contact and not on any of my socials. My boyfriend won\u2019t explain why he\u2019s asking again and what the purpose of making me recount it again is.  He is acting like there\u2019s clearly something bigger to discover that for some reason I\u2019m not telling him.    \n\nHe asked me to phone a friend from that time to ask them the name of the guy.  I refused.  Not because my friend wouldn\u2019t help out but because it would be hard to explain why and hugely deeply embarrassing to even ask. \n\nHe\u2019s gentle and sweet and I can tell he\u2019s struggling.  But I can\u2019t recall those details and I\u2019m not sure why I should even if I could.  I became really cross because rightly or wrongly it felt abusive to be asked again at this stage.  Added to the fact that he thinks I\u2019m now withholding the name.  He swears it\u2019s not jealousy.  He does struggle with low self esteem. \n\nSo AITA?

I find it really exhausting especially after a hard days work but not sinister.  I\u2019m strong minded and can\u2019t be easily toyed with.  I think you\u2019ve nailed it without making him sound like a controlling loon.  I think it is about an inability to be in this present.

I don\u2019t mind sharing things as I wanted an honest relationship after suffering a previous dishonest one.  I just wasn\u2019t expecting it to be like this once I had.

It\u2019s all conversation nothing more control wise but it\u2019s a head masher.   I think he does need psych help.  Anyone on here know anything that\u2019s worked?

I find them upsetting not beneficial at all.", "Good advice.  I\u2019m not in any rush to progress this relationship further until/unless this is addressed.  All the comments tonight have helped me see that is necessary.  I knew it already but you hope you\u2019re wrong when you really care about the person.

That\u2019s about as far from honest as it gets. \n\nStop indulging this now. He\u2019s never going to be satisfied until he thinks he\u2019s caught you and whatever punishment he\u2019s looking to inflict on you in retaliation will not be pleasant. \n\nSimply tell him you\u2019ve said all you\u2019re going to say about your past relationships/flings/whatever.

He doesn\u2019t get to torture you with whatever bullshit game he\u2019s playing.", "Follow your instincts and protect yourself.", "That\u2019s because it pretty much is a test that you have failed by not giving him the details. You aren\u2019t initiating this conversation. It\u2019s not for your benefit. Regardless of what he tells you, these conversations are doing something for him.
