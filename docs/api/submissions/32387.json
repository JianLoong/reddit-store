I've shared a lot of information I've learned in classes...it's not like you sign a non disclosure statement prior to every class...so I doubt this is any different. So, you don't have to share it...but others very likely have.", "Seriously? Are recipes covered under copyright laws? It\u2019s your aunt. It\u2019s a recipe! If you buy a cookbook or cooking magazine you have paid for the recipes. If your aunt asked for one of those recipes would you trot out this \u201cI paid for it\u201d excuse?", "This is so beyond petty on your part that I\u2019m going with YTA. \n\nLike if you were going into business and it was your secret recipe, hey all power to you, but this is just silly. \u201cI don\u2019t want to share knowledge I paid for\u201d. That\u2019s the core of my job: pay for a degree to share that knowledge with the public. You\u2019re not giving her the whole class.", "YTA. Do you think she's going to take the recipe and sell it or something? Get over yourself please.", "Did the chef ask you to keep it secret?\n\nYou've been weird here. Could the aunt have paid to get it off you? That would have been weird right?  \n\nYou're thinking about money in an asshole way. In the wide world, it's an unevenly distributed and precious key for opening doors - unfortunately. Between family, friends? Who cares? Don't be the \"economic logic\" of the times in someone else's life.\n\nSome people worry that insanely jealous IP legal regimes block knowledge sharing you know. Who'd have thought?", "YTA.  I doubt this recipe is actually unique.  You paid for the class, not the recipe.  You will not be harmed, if your aunt makes the pie, too", "INFO what do you mean you got it from one of the courses you took? Do you mean it was a recipe taught in a class you paid for?", "Are you kidding?", "YTA. I never could understand the concept of \u201csecret recipes\u201d. I\u2019ve created a lot of recipes. The ingredients came from a store that\u2019s open to the general public. That\u2019s not very secret. I\u2019m absolutely flattered that you like what I cooked. Yes, you may have the recipe. Feel free to share it. Post it online, if that\u2019s your thing. \n\nIt\u2019s one thing if you own a restaurant and you are concerned about competition. If you\u2019re just a home chef like me, share. \n\nLastly, your aunt is your FAMILY. You only get one FAMILY. Recipes are a dime a dozen. Don\u2019t ever mistreat anyone in your family. They are the ones that will be there for you, when the rest of the world turns its back on you.  Do you have any idea how many people have no family and would like to have one?", "The fact that you apparently took out a loan to outside a hobby has nothing to do with whether you should share a recipe with your aunt. This is bizarre.", "no vote but just send her one of the similar recipes and say it's the recipe you used... problem solved", "Just type in the ingredients onto google and the name of the recipe and you\u2019ll probably find the same one, if not very similar. Then send her the link. Or you can just send her the recipe because she\u2019s not likely to try to monetize it, just bake it on her own. YTA", "YTA. You didn't pay for the recipe you paid for a class that just happen to teach you that recipe. It's not some secret recipe either. You lose absolutely nothing by sharing the recipe. You're just being selfish.", "Don\u2019t hide behind having paid for the class. Either deep down you want to share the recipe with your aunt, or for whatever reason, you don\u2019t want to share the recipe. I\u2019m sure you have your reasons. That being said, that will still make you YTA.", "Yes.", "YTA you're not running a competitive pie business don't gatekeep recipes!  Most people have paid for a recipe at some point, what do you think cookbooks are?  Who cares how you came by it, cooking classes aren't NDA just share it with her.", "NTA. I imagine that for bakers, pies and cakes are like your calling card. You don\u2019t need to give out your intellectual property. She can ask. You can say no.", "NTA.  Sharing is an act of generosity.  If you're not feelin' it, then don't share.  Too bad that you let your explanation go beyond  \" I don't want to.\"  Your private thoughts and reasons for doing anything are not intended for public consumption.", "NAH. She isn't the a for asking and you aren't for refusing. I've taken such courses before and there is an implicit understanding that you won't make the recipes and materials public. I think it's even in the materials that they request you don't share it online. \n\nWhat I've done in such a situation is to explain a crucial step that I learned, usually the recipe doesn't matter all that much but the little details they teach you during hands on teaching are way more important than the printed stuff. 'aunt, if you want to improve your... it's really essential to...'", "Nta. She's not entitled to it. She could dissect it to figure it out. You would get less Y T A if it was your uncle asking a niece. But we know how this works. Just give her the course that the recipe is in and say you don't have thr recipe anymore.", "If it isn't a big deal (according to your aunt) for you to give her the recipe then why is it a big deal for you *not* to give it? You're not obligated to give her a recipe that is special to you if you don't want to. She had the right to ask, and you have the right to say no. It's really not that serious. \n\nI'm gonna go with NAH (unless your aunt holds a grudge against you over this...then she's being ridiculous)", "NAH, your aunt can ask and you can say no. Every family has their own recipes and id like to have my own recipes that if i make something i like it to be better then the people i know. I feel like if you would then being how good it is eating it too much makes it less special.", "Nta, you paid for the recipe time and effort, she can do the same", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don't understand that aspect of your thinking. You volunteered to pay for a course to improve a hobby skill.
