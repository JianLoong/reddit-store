It's very itchy, I get things stuck in it and I don't think it looks good at all. My girlfriend on the other hand likes men with beards.

I finally had enough and I shaved the whole thing off. My girlfriend got upset when she saw and she told me that we had agreed that I wouldn't shave my beard off anymore. I told her we never made any kind of agreement and I didn't want the thing on anymore.\n\nShe pressed me and said I could have gotten it trimmed or I could have used beard oil her friend gave me (her friend works in a salon). I told her that it was my choice to get rid of it. I shouldn't have to make compromises with my body. I also saved us money by doing it all myself.\n\nShe then called me an AH for using that argument against her as it's for women only. I personally don't see how this doesn't apply and I told her that this can't be a woman only thing and that she is being mad hypocritical. She said that this was different because it's just a beard and me using that argument is me comparing my choices with that of women who decide not to have children. I told her that my body was causing my discomfort and I am choosing comfort/practicality over looks and she has to accept it.\n\nShe isn't talking to me now and now I feel bad.", "created_utc": 1703266006, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18ok4th/aita_for_using_the_my_body_my_choice_argument/", "score": 1116, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That argument is for anyone with a body.

He has never had a moustache ever before in his life, but he decided that our wedding was the time.  So our (quite expensive lol) wedding photos are me the bride and introducing my husband, Mr. Moustache.  Do I like moustaches?  Not particularly.  But I love my husband, and it's his body.

Don't let her tell you otherwise just so you fit her definition of 'hot', she should think you're fit whatever.
