She had 9 bridesmaids in all, 5 are her family and the other 4 were friends including me, another old friend of hers from college and then 2 girls she recently became friends with in her city. I noticed one of her newer friends was kinda rude to me and all around a mean girl. This girl was also 22 years old, which I found interesting given the age difference.

Did you apologize at the time?", "Not quite sure what the mean girl has to do with anything. You do a lot of build up and then at the very end you mention that you were late to her bridal shower. 2 hours? That's a little more than time management. It's pretty disrespectful. Not sure I'd want somebody in my wedding party that can't be trusted to show up on time, or at all. YTA", "You were booted from the wedding party because you were two hours late for the wedding shower.  That showed the bride she can\u2019t depend on you to show up on time for her wedding.  \n\nYour post shows a fundamental lack of honesty.  You know you were booted due to your being late for the shower.

You \"missed most of it\" because you were \"feeling a little off\"? What does that even mean?? You don't sound like a reliable friend.\n\nTo answer your question, if you already RSVP'd that you would attend and she already ordered your meal then you would be the AH only if you don't send a gift big enough to cover the cost of food. If you plan on skipping and also not sending a gift then light you're the AH but she probably knew this might happen when she made that decision", "After checking posting history and seeing the screenshots of the text message though it\u2026plus the fact the bride took a screenshot and accidentally sent it to her shows it might be some shit talk behind back. OP you don\u2019t know who she is doing it with so might not be \u201cmean\u201d girl. Either way\u2026E-S-H but YWNBTA(if I spelt that right first time doing that judgement) you need to work better on not being late to things and you would not be TA if you didn\u2019t go. I wouldn\u2019t go when it\u2019s clear that they did indeed intend to shit talk behind your back, no reason to ss your convo otherwise unless you were being very rude or harassing her which you weren\u2019t. Don\u2019t go and request money back for what you did spend on dress and such IF you did. End the friendship and be done with it", "YTA for being late and then trying to somehow make you being cut from the wedding party about this about a woman being mean to you rather than your own lack of consideration.", "I don't know what the mean girl had to do with it, outside of the fact that you clearly just don't like your friend's new friend lol. \n\nBut NTA for no longer wanting to attend, it's your prerogative after all.", "I\u2019ll be honest, my best friend and MOH was more than two hours late to my bridal shower and tbh, I don\u2019t know if things have been the same between us since. A wedding is an extremely vulnerable time and and you just want people around you that you know you can rely on.", "NTA, but it sounds like the bride was using the tardiness as an excuse to cut you out. Well, that\u2019s my impression.", "INFO have you paid for the bridesmaid dress?", "ESH\n\nYour friend is totally justified for cutting you. It could be because of downsizing, but it could be you missing so much of the shower without much of a good reason (a little bit off?). I wouldn\u2019t feel that reassured by \u2018I won\u2019t be late to the wedding\u2019 promises. That alone makes YTA.\n\nBut she\u2019s also an asshole for cutting you so close to the wedding after you\u2019ve already dished out all that money. You probably already have the dress. The gifts. It\u2019s a lot of commitment you\u2019ve already done all the hard part, you just needed to watch her get ready and eat and get photos taken at that point. Without a good reason, that makes her also sound like an a-hole.\n\nSo yeah. ESH. This sounds like a disaster friendship.", "You're maybe TA for being late to her bridal shower (although you had a medical reason and apologised, so on the fence), but you're NTA for not going to the wedding if you don't feel comfortable going, mostly because she initially lied to you about the reason for cutting you as a bridesmaid. If she had been upfront about the reason to begin with it would be a different story.", "Info: did you purchase your bridesmaid\u2019s dress? Shoes, etc?", "YTA. Unless you purchased a bridesmaids dress, spending money on the bachelorette party is no different then spending money on a vaca. A lot of your \u201carguments\u201d are about you and YOUR feelings and opinions. A wedding is about the people getting married.

It\u2019s super rude and friends don\u2019t do that, especially after spending so much money on her wedding. I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong by being late to the bridal shower either. It\u2019s not like you went out shopping and forgot or something. It was anxiety related. I would learn from it and try to get therapy to deal with it. But if my friend showed up late to my bridal shower over anxiety I wouldn\u2019t care because I would be grateful that they showed up at all.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I had a lot of anxiety that day (anxiety disorder) and it can impact delay my time management.", "Being 2 hours late after disturbing the bride in the middle of the night the prior evening. Sounds like a very exhausting friend. Not to mention unreliable.\n\nThe \"downsizing\" was probably the bride's way of trying to be kind and allow OP to save face.", "OP has already *given* gifts.", "OP dumped a lot of money on the Bachelorette party and wedding shower. She does not owe the bride a gift.", "Bc the mean girl was shit talking everyone and I know she\u2019s all in my friends ear.", "Yeah. I kinda feel that way too. I admit I was 2 hours late to the shower Sunday morning and the night before I did wake her up from my shower. But I feel she is being incredibly rude", "I just have to pause and take exception to your view that paying for a Bach Party is like spending money on a personal vacay\u2026for a lot of us out here, our idea of a vacation is so far apart from a bachelorette party that going to those things becomes an act of love and a sincere sacrifice of time and money. If OP is that type of person, paying for that party was not like paying for a vacation she would choose. That said, I do wonder if OP is a reliable narrator here.\n\nIf OP already bought the dress and paid for a lot, then the bride was an AH to remove her without offering to reimburse some expenses.\n\nRegardless, I think the friendship has already run it\u2019s course on both sides, so I think OP WNBTA to skip the wedding. Her presence might actually be uncomfortable for the bride at this point.", "Since you yourself seem to know that your anxiety can impact your time management, it\u2019s not really a surprise you were cut. It seems like they were trying to take the nice way out, saying they\u2019re downsizing. Unless they\u2019re giggling and whispering to each other while pointing at you, it doesn\u2019t really seem like they\u2019re cutting you ill-spiritedly. It truly just seems like they don\u2019t want to take the risk of you feeling anxious and showing up late.", "Just mentioning this, OP, not playing armchair psychiatrist but I struggled with anxiety and time management and was misdiagnosed several times before they found out I have ADHD and all that comes with it like: rejection sensitivity (feeling like everyone hates me), tardiness, forgetfulness, mood swings/emotional dysregulation, hyperactivity (which is typically racing thoughts and restlessness in adults)\n\nSomething to consider, if nothing else. I'm sorry you're dealing with these terrible feelings, regardless of the causes it hurts to feel unaccepted.", "The thing is, you don't know that. It may have something to do with you being cut or it could really be that you were 2 hours late to her shower.", "You sound 14 years old", "Wait are you 18 or 28?

A bathroom shower? What time? Was there a plan to share accommodation the night before the wedding?", "Thank u! I actually am super ADHD and take medicine for it", "No were not sharing accommodations her wedding weekend at all. So we went out Saturday night for her bachelorette and then just me, the bride and the mean girl all shared a hotel suite that me and the mean girl paid for( the bride didn\u2019t spend a dime). So we got in around 1am and then i took a shower after everyone went to bed. I apologized to her and said I was so sorry I wasn\u2019t thinking it\u2019d wake anyone up.", "Stop being so rude about \"mean girl\" lol she hasn't done a single thing wrong.\n\nAlso brides usually don't pay they're forking out on a wedding.", "Tbh it sounds like they used you to pay for said festivities.
