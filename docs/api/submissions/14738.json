That\u2019s why I\u2019m going with YTA.", "I would call it ESH personally, but then I'm feeling mad about someone who was late, LOL", "i mean she's ALLOWED, but considering she's not paying OP and in fact OP has been paying for the \"pleasure\" of doing what the bride wants for the bride's whims/pleasure in relation to her wedding, that's pretty pathetic....", "Everything but the shoe size of the \"mean\" girl, and then *\"oh and I missed most of her bridal shower because I felt off byeee\"*\n\nDon't have to go to the wedding, but I wouldn't want a bridesmaid who missed my shower because she \"felt off\" either.", "Not only that, but I\u2019m pretty sure OP is the mean girl. The bride said \u201cplease just accept my decision and let\u2019s move on, I know that\u2019s hard for you to do\u201d which says pretty much everything about who OP is as a friend. \n\nAnd that\u2019s before you factor in that the bride correctly calls out OP for only caring about herself and not the bride\u2019s stress, and claims that the bride brought up being late as a reason even though it was actually OP that straight up asked if it was because of being late to the bridal shower, when in reality it was three times during one weekend, one time 2 hours late, one time 4 hours late and who knows how late she was to the third event. She even needed a \u201cplan to get her to show up early to the wedding\u201d with someone, which means it\u2019s not just \u201cfeeling off\u201d but a general lack of respect for anyone other than herself. \n\nOP, you need to do some deep reflection here, because you\u2019re misrepresenting things HEAVILY and someone who can\u2019t take accountability and blames others isn\u2019t a good friend or frankly, a good person.", "Yup. Siblings 2 hours and 40 minutes late for a rehearsal. Had the audacity to tell me they just couldn\u2019t pull it together in time and talked shit about what a control freak I am for being pissed. Relationships have never recovered from that.", "We're no longer friends with one of my husband's groomsmen because of his shenanigans going up to the wedding.\n\nBeing a dick surrounding a bride of groom's event leading up to a wedding is more than enough reason for a cut imo. It's grounds for a permanent cut.", "I think OP has been unreliable and I understand both perspectives. Expecting everything to be perfect and for everybody to travel and conform exactly how one person wants, is unrealistic. \nAdhd is a disability and she knew her friend before she asked her to be a bridesmaid. Both people should be transparent.\n\nWeddings are bullshit anyway imo. As unrealistic expectations that come with them.", "OMG thank god someone brought this up", "I agree with you but I would consider the fact that adhd is a spectrum and just because you can do that, it doesn\u2019t mean others can.\n\nBride knew who the friend was/is, she should have been transparent.", "OP\u2019s post history shows she is seriously downplaying her tardiness not for just the bridal shower but an entire weekend of events.", "Apparently not much since she was 2 hours late to the bridal shower", "Or is it the fact that OP was 2 hours late?", "While it\u2019s an understandable aspect of anxiety, neither of you can guarantee you won\u2019t have this issue on the day OF her wedding. As a reforming late person whose struggles w time management have hurt peoples feelings, working around late adults for big, emotional events like weddings adds so much stress and the bridal party is there to help make the day easier and joyful, not stressful. If she feels like she can\u2019t rely on you to be a responsive and timely member of the bridal party it\u2019s not so  crazy for her to relieve you of that responsibility \u2014 but still want you there to celebrate her big day, just without that duty.\n\nIf this was a one time thing with tardiness I\u2019d understand and call her the asshole for sure, but if it\u2019s that she doesn\u2019t see you as a reliable friend when it comes to scheduled events, then you might be burying the lede. In your other posts you don\u2019t mention you were two hours late which I suspect is why you\u2019re getting a lot of sympathy and the bride sounds unreasonable.", "See that's not good enough. I'm sure she has anxiety, she's the one getting married. You aren't capable of being a bridesmaid so you should just accept the fact and step down.", "This needs to be higher up. Seriously. Four freaking hours late?!", "Wow. Yeah, that\u2019s really shit.\n\nThere are so many information gaps in this post you could drive a truck through them. It\u2019s pretty much \u201cmy best friend from college dumped me as her bridesmaid *for no reason at all* but I think the 22 year old has something to do with it.\u201d\n\nAnd some weird comments about the age gap. Like a 28 year old can\u2019t be friends with a 22 year old.", "Expecting people to not be 2 hours late to events is very different to expecting everything to be perfect.\n\nAlso, thinking a friend is going to step up when it\u2019s such an important day to you is hardly unusual or a crazy thought. OP showed the bride she was incorrect to expect she could rely on her.", "Maybe she was mean because she was upset you were two hours late to her friends bridal shower??", "Lol I can see why you left details out of this story. \n\nYou don't have to go to the wedding. That's your right. But come on now!", "This. This here. YTA.", "My kid has ADHD and autism, and while I do get what you're saying, I can also totally understand being dismissed as a bridesmaid if she couldn't get through it for the shower. The bride needs dependable bridesmaids. \n\nSo OP's hurt feelings really suck, but she already woke the bride up the night before, and then missed most of her shower.", "My kid has the same diagnoses, and weirdly, he is early to everything (probably because he worries about being late). I wish I could bottle that Always Being Early ^(TM) and sell it!", "I am not defending how OP has handled this but\u2026\n\nSurely if your kid was cut for literally having a disability just because they couldn\u2019t conform, you\u2019d be pissed? The bride new exactly who she was inviting?\n\nIt\u2019s ok for her to change her mind but I think not providing OP with transparency at least, was really shitty.\n\nI think they\u2019re both assholes \ud83d\ude02", "So you know that you\u2019re prone to be late - apparently VERY late, but you don\u2019t understand why she decided she couldn\u2019t count on you?", "So there's a huge risk that you'll be late to the wedding as you may well get an anxiety attack again with the stress of it? You've proven that you're unable to put your friend first when these things happen. YTA for not putting her needs first on her wedding day.", "Lmao YTA, I have ADHD, take medication for it, and still the only things I am late to are things I dread going to and that is 100% a me thing, I don't want it to be on purpose but it is still my mental abilities causing the delays so it's still me and my fault, she has every reason to worry you will be late to her wedding. \n\nJust because it's a \"disability\" (I say disability like that because when I am medicated I actually function better than a normal person, at least I feel like I do and that's good for me so I try not to see it as a disability) you have doesn't mean it's not inconvenient for other people and that they should have to cater to your personal needs when the day is truly supposed to be about the couple getting married, I would probably want to but you out too.", "So you were staying in a hotel suite with them and you were still 2 hrs late to the bridal shower?? Did you even have to travel to get there? \n\nIt sounds like you just decided you didn't want to get out of bed and slept through the shower, and thats why the bride- very reasonably- doesn't want you as a bridesmaid. YTA.", "How were you 2 hours late to the shower when you were literally staying with the bride? This is more than just tardiness and I'm sorry but she has every right to cut you from the party.", "I wouldn't go to the wedding, but it does sound like you were kind of a PITA, and this \"mean\" girl was simply justifiably annoyed with your obnoxious behavior.", "Wait you were 2 hours late despite being in a hotel room? So it\u2019s not like you were home and stuck in traffic or had a work call? You literally had zero excuse to be late.", ">we got in around 1am and then i took a shower after everyone went to bed.\n\nI dont really understand why you're getting downvoted here. A lot of people are unwilling to sacrifice their hygiene routine. \n\nLike, if this was 'aita for refusing to shower after a night of heavy drinking because the smell grosses out my partner' everyone would say yta. But here we have someone showering for their own comfort and they're the asshole?\n\nDon't share a room if you can't deal with people just existing in the shared space.", "Mine is usually early too. On bad days, she still isn't late, she usually slides in right on time. If she is late ever, it's a minute or two... not TWO HOURS. \n\nI'd buy your bottles to drink myself lol.", "That\u2019s very true and she had every right to do so but why not just be transparent instead of skirting around the obvious which, has probably caused a bigger issue than it needed to be.", "Nope the shower was 30 mins away and I had to get there by myself along with all my luggage. She and her friend had to go to a hair appointment hours before it", "Unless you had to walk there with all your luggage , that isn't really an excuse.\n\nYou were staying with the bride and were 2 hours late to the shower. Wedding weekend you're staying separate and are promising to not be late ... I mean, the track record isn't great here, surely you can see that? The bride is within her right to remove a potential stress factor from her wedding morning.", "So why were you 2 hours late?", "Why do you need luggage for a shower? It\u2019s not a week long event it\u2019s a 3 hour party. And if it\u2019s 30 minutes away why were you 2 hours late? You talk shit about her other friends with the \u201cage difference\u201d but you\u2019re 27 still begging your parents to co-sign on apartments because you don\u2019t work and are still in school. Maybe her 22 year old friends aren\u2019t as entitled as yourself."]}
