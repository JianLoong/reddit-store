You can see from the messages the OP understands that. Everybody else there will know why it happened. So the bride's approach is not kind, it comes off as infantilizing and condescending. They have been friends for 10 years. She should've told her the truth. Should the OP really come to the wedding where everyone will be telling her what a shame it was that the wedding had to be downsized with a fake smile, obviously lying to her? It's much more hurtful and embarrassing than being told the truth.", "OP also woke her up in the middle of the night the night before by taking a shower in a shared hotel room in the middle of the night and not thinking about how it would disrupt the others in that shared space.", "Wanting your bridesmaid to show up on time instead of 4 hours late to the wedding (as OP did to one of the pre-wedding events without an excuse or reason) doesn't seem like a particularly frivolous whim...", "Done!

On top of that, you seem to struggle with honesty, self awareness, and victimhood. You've posted about this situation eight freaking times and only by piecing together your various posts and comments has the truth come out. Your friend wasn't dishonest about her reasons.

But I've been on the side of, \"being given an excuse\" because the friend was trying to be gentle and hint at what the actual problem was. Except I didn't pick up the hint, I took the words at face value. \n\nThat ends one of two ways. 1.) the person reaches boiling point with the behaviour that irritates them and explodes at you and you are shocked to discover you've been causing offence and hurt your friend bottled it up for so long. Or the friend starts being weird with you and freezing you out and you spend ages trying to figure out what you've done to hurt their feelings. 2.) You discover the excuse is BS, confront your friend, find out why they're really unhappy. You then spend the rest of the friendship second guessing everything, worried you might be missing another 'hint' or 'polite excuse' about your behaviour.", "She starts with a white lie.  I had to cut down on bridesmaids and I can\u2019t keep you on.  Is it true?  No.  It\u2019s a social fig leaf that lets OP down gently, by creating a fake outside cause other than OP.  Not everyone likes that, but it\u2019s a common thing and generally regarded as kind.\n\nEven if you think this is infantilizing and condescending, it\u2019s also an attempt to avoid OP\u2019s drama factory from starting up.  From the beginning OP understood this was about her behavior, kept pressing on the issue, wouldn\u2019t stop playing the victim, and then ran here with a false narrative to tell people the bride was an asshole.  OP\u2019s behavior justifies the attempt to end this with less drama.\n\nWhen OP presses, asking for details and the actual reason and saying she would understand if her lateness is it, the bride gives it to her straight.  OP doesn\u2019t accept that as the end of the discussion and keeps trying to get her to change her mind.\n\nThe bride replies that she cares about OP, wants to see her at the wedding, but she isn\u2019t going to be a bridesmaid.  I guess you will look at the line where she says this isn\u2019t a job and she isn\u2019t being fired or cut as dishonest, but it felt quite kind to me.  It\u2019s trying to help OP reframe this in her mind in a less harsh light, which is nice to me since OP is going to have to come to terms with it.\n\nOP is being asked to step down for cause.  She earned this, and then made the conversation painful at every step.  The bride would have been justified in being significantly more blunt and harsh.  She instead tries to be conciliatory, salve OP\u2019s pride, avoid drama, and maintain the friendship.", "100%. Also some wedding things like venue and vendors are scheduled for a specific time frame.

She still didn't want to tell the truth. Why?

It will always stay as something unsaid between OP and the bride, and OP and that group of people.", "Yeah, the hint approach is not the best in general although I see why someone would want to avoid going straight to confrontation in day-to-day situations. But a wedding is a high-stakes situation and it's not just between OP and the bride, others in the wedding party and probably many guests are privy to what is happening. \n\nBeing cut off a month before the wedding/ Having to cut off your bridesmaid a month before the wedding for being unreliable is embarrassing/ uncomfortable as it is, without having to pretend at the actual wedding and afterward.", "The thing is that you and I see differently what salvages OP's pride and maintains friendship. As I said, I agree with her decision to have OP step down as a bridesmaid. I disagree with not being straightforward about what the reason was. Starting with the white lie I can understand, but when your friend of 10 years that was such a good friend to you that you asked them to be a bridesmaid confronts you about it obviously being a lie, then you tell the truth.

You make it sound like her anxiety is a moral flaw.", "Exactly what I was thinking. It's like she couldn't accept the majority of people on subs called her out so she has to keep making posts until one makes her feel justified in her actions and that's mostly because she leaves out massive details", "It was a really odd point to make.

Want me there at 10am? then I have to pretend we start at 9 am to give me a fighting chance to get there on time.  I'd rather stand outside a place for 30 mins without anxiety than try and get somewhere for the proper time and burn my brain out.", "I'm that ADHD person too, my best friend is perpetually late (no ADHD) and it really stresses me out.

This is what I get for reading reddit comments while I\u2019m at work haha.\n\nYeah :-)", "She mentions the lateness and then goes back to keeping it small.", "Look, I\u2019m a chronically late person. But your post history indicates you tardiness was throughout an important weekend. When things are important, you get yourself there. 15 minutes is understandable, 2 hours is absurd. Has this been a pattern throughout your friendship? Have you let her down by being late/flakey before? I think you should take more accountability for your actions", "YTA - she has been nice to you about it and tried to spare your feelings.\nI get that you have several conditions that make you more likely to overthink things and react badly to certain social situations but she\u2019s given you good reasons and explained to you and you\u2019re still harassing her and anyone else who will listen (including multiple Reddit subs) for reassurance and validation.\n\nAnd she\u2019s given you plenty: she\u2019s made it very clear she still wants you to attend the wedding and that she cares very much about you. If you respect her at all your effort should be going into trusting her on that - if she didn\u2019t want you there she\u2019d not have taken so much time to explain; but she isn\u2019t acting like someone who is trying to pick a fight with you.\n\nI say this with the deepest of sympathy and understanding as someone who was very like you at your age: it\u2019s time you learned to manage your own feelings and accept that you can neither know nor control everything about the people around you, no matter how close your relationship to them. She doesn\u2019t owe you further explanation than she\u2019s given and she doesn\u2019t have to change her mind about this - but you are applying a LOT of pressure to her at the moment and she doesn\u2019t deserve that.\n\nHer reasons are valid for not wanting you as a bridesmaid. Your hurt at that is understandable but you are trying to deflect accountability for your lateness and trying to get someone - anyone - to join you in blaming the \u201cmean girl\u201d for manipulating your friend or persuading her to drop you, and that shows you are also acting out of jealousy here at not being the bestest friend. Again that isn\u2019t your call to make and it\u2019s a distraction from acknowledging and really accepting that you caused the bride a lot of stress this past week or two that she really doesn\u2019t need to be dealing with.\n\nYour options are quite straightforward here: if you want to keep the friendship then you need to find a way to genuinely forgive the bride for upsetting you (she\u2019s not to blame for that but forgiveness in this instance is essential to stop yourself from bringing this up forevermore throughout the rest of your friendship). And you should try to attend the wedding because it shows good grace and genuine care for her (and isn\u2019t about your feelings).\n\nIf you are angry, hurt or upset abound this enough to end the friendship over it then don\u2019t attend - the message to your friend will be clear from that and you can both move on.\n\nThe part that makes you an asshole is that you\u2019re repeatedly trying to change the circumstances and social nuances here instead of accepting and dealing with the situation as it currently is, and it\u2019s causing stress to the bride because you\u2019re being pushy and insistent about getting answers she\u2019s clearly uncomfortable giving."]}
