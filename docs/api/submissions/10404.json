Get a job, stop being a mooch.\n\nIf you cared about your daughter at all, you\u2019d have a job. Honestly, he deserves custody. Why should jobless mommy have custody?", "NTA\n\nHe can put up whatever boundaries he\u2019s comfortable with. His AP doesn\u2019t get a say in how he supports your child. If he\u2019s not talking to you about it I don\u2019t know why you entertain any commentary from her.", "Cheating is terrible. But that doesn\u2019t mean he should have to pay for it for the rest of his life. It\u2019s not murder folks, it\u2019s infidelity.\nGood grief.", "She doesn\u2019t have a job.", "She\u2019s making me side with the cheater. Lol.\n\nLike honestly, based on her behavior, can you blame him? Good grief.", "> I get that he\u2019s a cheater but women who take everything from men through child support because they\u2019re vindictive are just pathetic and feeding that twisted system. \n\nShow me one legitimate study that says women take 'everything' through child support.", "I love how this sub is always screaming that its biased towards women. Yet when a woman cheats everyone's like 'take her for all she's worth and get full custody. A woman who breaks up a family can't be a good mother'\n\nYet here you are asking your cheating ex to pay for activities for your shared child and someone you're the asshole. \n\nYou're not asking for a car, or expensive boarding schools, or fancy electronics. Just run of the mill after school activities for your kid.\n\nMaybe its not actually men that this sub hates."]}
