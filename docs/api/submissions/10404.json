He sounds like a good father that made some really horrible mistakes in the past, and he now has a fianc\u00e9, so this must have happened awhile ago right?

If i was this guy i'd have you in custody court by the end of the month. And as it seems OP doesn't have a job by her response to the fianc\u00e9e, have you ever thought of how to pay for everything if your ex gets tired of the bs and leaves you high and dry? \nYTA OP", "YTA\n\nKnock it off. No one wins if you're playing shitty, competitive games to get him to prove he loves his daughter with you more than his other children. Not even your daughter.\n\nTake your court mandated child support, get a job, and only approach for more on the big ticket decisions, such as education or a car.", "ESH, he should be paying for his daughter regardless and he sucks for cheating but you suck for taking advantage and not working if both of your jobs to take care of your daughter.", "Grow up. You\u2019re entitled to child support and thats it. Stop taking away from his other kids because you feel like being petty. YTA", "It\u2019s very clear how jealous you are of your exs new life, grow up. This has nothing to do with your child and it\u2019s sad that you think this is ok to do when he has two other children and you don\u2019t even work? YTA get a job for god sake.", "NTA. He is supposed to financially support his daughter.  It is called \"child support\".  That includes ballet classes, if that is what your daughter wants, and you choose to the spend money he sends on that.\n\nIf you haven't already, I'd see about getting a formal support order, so he is obligated to pay it, regardless of what his current partner wants.  Are the other two kids his kids, or just his fiancee's kids?  He is the biological father of your daughter, and has a financial obligation to her, despite what his fiancee thinks.", "YTA get over It, and youre using your daughter as leverage. U", "NTA. \n\nThe other children's mother(s) need(s) to get more money out of him for his other children.\n\nFiancee is out of pocket putting her nose into his business with his children's mothers. \n\nMaybe he can't afford to get married right now. \n\nHe needs to make better choices.", "More details please...doesn't he have to pay some kind of aliment anyway? I would say YNTA if you use the money for your daughter or the money you cannot make yourself because you take care of your daughter", "Nta. His financial situation is not your problem. He is your kid\u2019s father and you have the right to ask for support. Giving you extra money is his choice. If his girlfriend has a problem with that she should take it up with him or family court.  He is an adult and needs to make sure he can provide for all of his kids. That has nothing to do with you.", "YTA", "YTA\n\nThe fact that you're using your daughter as a weapon to get money out of him is so ridiculous. I'm with the fiancee.

If the other kids are the victims of this behavior, that's not okay. True, he has 3 kids to support, he should help out with the bills for your daughter. But taking advantage of it, is something else. Time to put a few things at rest.", "I feel like more information is needed. Is the fianc\u00e9 the one he cheated with? Are they his bio kids or her kids from another relationship? How long ago did you split up? Is he paying child support?\n\nI mean at first pass, at some point you need to stop taking advantage of him, so a little bit of YTA, but there are a lot of factors that may change that.", "NTA. If he's willing to pay for his daughter's extra curriculars, then i don't see the problem. Are his other kids going without because of this? Also are they his biological kids?", "YTA.

It's her new woman that has to talk to him not OP.", "I don\u2019t know if you read it or not but OP is making him pay for 90% of their needs so she is taking advantage of him completely and that is probably causing his home life with his other two kids to worsen by the day because OP can\u2019t seem to grasp the fact that she is being immature over something that happened years ago and she should just be asking the ex to help pay for this ONLY THE KID NEEDS not for her too.", "I'm not using her as a weapon but I'm also not going to let his actions deprive her of the life she would've lived had he not been a cocky asshole who couldn't keep it in his pants.", "She's the one who he cheated with.
