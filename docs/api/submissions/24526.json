Leaving a child with an unwilling caregiver is not kind to the child. It is not good parenting. Itis selfish and inconsiderate to the child to leave him or her with a sitter who has been bullied into watching them. Young chilren can sense resentment and are distressed by it.\n\n3. It is selfish and inconsiderate to demand someome quit a job to do work for you that they already refused to do simply because you were too lazy to find another employee who was available when you needed childcare. \n\n4.

Reminder: this baby's parents were already told I will not do this job.\n\n5. It is selfish and inconsiderate to demand I bail on my other job.  To me.and to my.employer. \n\n6. It is selfish and inco siderate to bully/badger me for the above. \n\n7. This issue is closed. I will not reschedule or cancel my other job.
