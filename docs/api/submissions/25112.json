(Probably mostly because they weren\u2019t far enough ahead or quick enough to take you up on your offer themselves lol)", "YTA. You added your order\u2019s time to the process. That\u2019s what the line was for: to process people\u2019s orders.", "YTA - Doesn't matter if you paid for the whole order, you skipped the line and people were right in glaring at you for being an AH.  Do you even know the reason there are lines to begin with?  It means you wait your turn, first come first served (ring a bell AH?), that is what they are for.", "YTA. Cutting the line is cutting the line. I\u2019m sure the person who let you skip is very happy to have their food paid for. However, that doesn\u2019t change the fact that your sandwich being made set back the folks that already been waiting a while.", "How was it a choice between cut in line or don\u2019t eat?

The employees still had to take the time to make your food, regardless of who paid the people waiting in line still had to wait longer because your food was being made before theirs. \n\nYour \u201cI paid for someone else\u2019s food so it\u2019s okay\u201d is bullshit and has no bearing on anything. So you paid extra to skip the line, but you still skipped the line.", "YTA. \n\nYou used money to skip the line. Skipping the line makes you an asshole. It\u2019s pretty clear cut.", "YTA. What you don\u2019t think everyone else in line didn\u2019t have something to do? What makes you so special? You could\u2019ve gone somewhere else to eat.", "Yeah, obviously YTA. Your time is not more important than anyone else's who was in the queue.", "Yes, it doesn't matter that you didn't cut the line in a traditional way, you still skipped ahead to put in an order before everyone else who was already there. YTA, not in a really horrible way or anything, but just by doing something kind of rude that you should avoid in the future.", "YTA - you still skipped the line and made everyone wait just a bit longer because apparently you're more important.  Self absorbed AH.", "YTA. You're entitled and obnoxious", "NTA\nYou just added a simple sandwich and paid for the other persons order.\n\nAnnoying? Perhaps.\nAsshole? Not imo.", "Idk I think NTA. You just added yourself to another party. If they should be pissed at someone it is the person who accepted the offer.", "NTA  Ingenious!  Tell the other losers to mind their own business!", "I'm going to say NTA. You didn't cause anyone to wait any longer for their food by your actions. Smart move as far as I'm concerned.", "YTA, just because you can afford for someone to help you do it, doesn\u2019t make it better, it makes it worse actually. You act as if this very restaurant is the only way for you to eat lunch. It of course is not.", "Its easy, when you question an action of yours, the reasoning must be the following : Would things work if everybody else was doing it ?\n\nIf the answer to this is \"no\", then it was an asshole action.\n\nYTA.", "Whoa, people left the line to go outside and call you rude and other people did as well? Where the hell did this happen? I don\u2019t EVER want to go there!!!", "NTA. Pretty funny too.", "If they can\u2019t get mad at the people at the front of the line for ordering another sandwich on their own, why can they get mad if you ask the people at the front to order one for you? NTA, op. Sounds like the others in the line are just jealous.", "NTA. If someone offered to pay for my lunch just to add their sandwich, totally do it.", "NTA\n\nYou had a problem.  You solved it and helped another person out in the process.  Anyone else could have done this.  It was ingenious.  Furthermore, it is not as if you did that and ordered all the remaining food for yourself or some other extreme act of selfishness.    If a person is holding a spot in line while their friend uses the bathroom, and they get in line with their friend, no reasonable person gets angry.  How is this truly different? \n\nThose people are so concerned about fairness but don't want to be fair to others or actually work to make things fair.  You didn't do anything worth even confronting.", "NTA", " NTA. I actually think your solution was pretty genius and helped both you and the person who accepted your offer.", "NTA. I would\u2019ve just been irritated to be further back and not get my meal paid for \ud83d\ude02 I\u2019ve waited in lines and ordered for multiple people before and this really isn\u2019t much different.
