Some people get so dumb about lines.\n\nNot exactly related, but this post reminded me of it. This low cost vet I'd go to would have walk ins on Saturday. They are first come first serve and usually get people beginning to line up at 6am. I arrived at 640 and there were a ton of cars out front but no one was getting out of thier car because of how cold it was. Each time I had been in the past people would stand in front of the fence and wait for them to open the gate onto the business. I got out of my car and stood behind the chair that was empty(the person went into thier car). Slowly after people started coming out and standing behind me. One person started making a huge deal saying they were there before me, but I stated no one was in line and the parked cars were not a line. I also said I know it's cold but it's first come first serve and no one was out here in line. The lady went ahead of me and started telling others I just make things up. Once the vet tech opened the gates the same lady tried to say \"all these people were ahead of him\" and she proceeded to tell her what I said \"we can't keep track of when people get here so we go by the order of the line\".

Op says it wasn't normally that busy, so maybe they were short staffed, or short of ingredients.  Maybe the delay was big maybe it wasn't.

I predict it'll be a pretty even split, but I vote NTA", "YTA - you made everyone wait for the time it took to make your sandwich.

I have always been the kind of person who would say yes if someone who had less items than me asked if they could cut in line, especially if I'm not in a hurry. That's never been an issue. However, there's something that I heard years ago that has really stuck with me. They basically said that my time might be irrelevant to me that I'm ok with someone cutting in front of me but I've unilaterally made the decision for everyone else behind me that their time was also unimportant. You may not have had the 20 minutes to wait... but what if there was someone else in line that had the same time constraint? You've basically made it seem like your time is the only time that matters. In the grand scheme of things, a sandwich is a sandwich but the time it took someone to make that sandwich might have been exactly the time taken away from someone who also didn't have 20 minutes to wait but didn't want to be starving the rest of the day as well.

Totally legit.", "What if he never enters the restaurant but stands outside with a sign saying \"bring me X sandwich and I'll give you $XX\" and the first person in line sells him the sandwich for good profit.
