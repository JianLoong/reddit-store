I'll try my best to not exceed the word limit and be as brief as I can.\n\nI (34F) never had the best relationship with my mother. It was not great when I was a kid but I managed. It went downhill after I came out when I was 20 and told her I had a girlfriend. I went on to marry the said girlfriend (36F- she's now my wife of 11 years - and we have 3 kids) and eventually lost contact with my mom. \n\nMy relationship with my siblings was better initially (I have 2 brothers and 2 sisters, all of them older). Now I married into a very comfortable family. I would help my siblings financially, emotionally and in any way I could. I later realized that they were exploiting me for monetary reasons and stopped that but didn't lose contact with them, only for the sake of being there for my nieces and nephews.\n\nMy mother passed away earlier this year at the age of 67. She had many health issues. Her lawyer contacted me to let me know she had left me a part of her belongings and some assets. I don't come from an exceptionally wealthy family but my mom was not poor at all.\n\nConsidering the relationship I had with my mom, I didn't feel comfortable taking the inheritance. I asked my wife and she said it was sweet of my mom to show this act of kindness even with the relationship we had and suggested maybe I could donate it to a charity doing research or providing health services for breast cancer patients in my mom's name (which is the disease my mom died from). I loved the idea and went on to officially do that.\n\nMy siblings were outraged once they found out. My mother left them all assets (though a bit less than mine). They were very angry that while this money won't make much of a difference to me, it is something that could change their lives and they needed it much more than some charity.\n\nMy nephews have even reached out to called me a selfish AH because their parents were hoping to send him and his siblings to college with the said money and now couldn't.

College is something you start saving for much earlier in life.
