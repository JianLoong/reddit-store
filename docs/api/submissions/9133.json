I'll try my best to not exceed the word limit and be as brief as I can.\n\nI (34F) never had the best relationship with my mother. It was not great when I was a kid but I managed. It went downhill after I came out when I was 20 and told her I had a girlfriend. I went on to marry the said girlfriend (36F- she's now my wife of 11 years - and we have 3 kids) and eventually lost contact with my mom. \n\nMy relationship with my siblings was better initially (I have 2 brothers and 2 sisters, all of them older). Now I married into a very comfortable family. I would help my siblings financially, emotionally and in any way I could. I later realized that they were exploiting me for monetary reasons and stopped that but didn't lose contact with them, only for the sake of being there for my nieces and nephews.\n\nMy mother passed away earlier this year at the age of 67. She had many health issues. Her lawyer contacted me to let me know she had left me a part of her belongings and some assets. I don't come from an exceptionally wealthy family but my mom was not poor at all.\n\nConsidering the relationship I had with my mom, I didn't feel comfortable taking the inheritance. I asked my wife and she said it was sweet of my mom to show this act of kindness even with the relationship we had and suggested maybe I could donate it to a charity doing research or providing health services for breast cancer patients in my mom's name (which is the disease my mom died from). I loved the idea and went on to officially do that.\n\nMy siblings were outraged once they found out. My mother left them all assets (though a bit less than mine). They were very angry that while this money won't make much of a difference to me, it is something that could change their lives and they needed it much more than some charity.\n\nMy nephews have even reached out to called me a selfish AH because their parents were hoping to send him and his siblings to college with the said money and now couldn't.

Your mom would be proud to know you donated the money to an important charity. \n\n>their parents were hoping to send him and his siblings to college with the said money and now couldn't.\n\nSo their parents weren't planning on sending them to college? College is something you start saving for much earlier in life. This is absolutely not on you that they keep squandering away their money and didn't make their kids a priority until they felt they deserved a lump sum of someone else's money.\n\nI guarantee you that your mom saw that they were financially exploiting her the same way they were to you and that's why they didn't get much from her. \n\nWhile you *could have* given them the money they resorted to bullying, guilt tripping, and yelling at you rather than pleading their case and hoping for empathy so I don't think you're in the wrong in any singular instance here.", "NTA. The inheritance was yours to spend or invest as you like. Your siblings have no claim to it. \n\nI understand that fraught familial relationships can sometimes make it hard to think clearly, but did they really fool you so bad with, \"It was selfish of you to give your money to charity,\" that you had to come on here and ask?", "Nta.  Your money your choice.  Period.", "NTA for not giving the funds to your siblings. I do think putting some of it in a trust/college fund for your own kids would have been another good idea for it, but that money was left to you by your mom. If she wanted your siblings to have the funds, she would have left it to them and based on your nephew's reaction, it sounds like your siblings already anticipated exploiting you for money again as they had already \"spent\" funds they didn't have yet. It's 100% yours to do with what you wish. I'm sorry for your losses.", "NTA\n\nIt was your Mom's money and she chose to give it to you.\n\nThen it was your money for you to choose to do whatever you wanted.\n\nThis money NEVER belonged to your siblings or niblings and they don't get to have an opinion about it.", "NTA. \n\nYou said they have a history of exploiting your kindness in the past. And they\u2019re doing it again right now. Donating to charity is a lovely idea. \n\nThe fact that they told your nephew YOUR inheritance would pay for his college is beyond entitled. Pretty gross to give their child hope on the expectation that you would fit the bill and then turn him on you bc they can\u2019t step up to the plate. Sad for you and for the nephew. \n\nKeep on keepin on momma. You\u2019re a good person. Don\u2019t let them make you think otherwise.", "NTA. She left the money to you to do with as you like. It\u2019s fitting that they would try to gaslight you into thinking giving the money away to charity instead of them was something bad, when they were the ones exploiting you financially in the first place.", "OMG the entitlement. \"My nephew have even reached out to call* me a selfish AH because the parents were hoping to send him and his siblings to collage with the said money and now couldn't\"\n\nThey just went ahead and planned on how to spend YOUR inheritance? They just assumed you would give it to them???\n\nTell your nephew that he and his parents are NOT entitled to any of your money, if you want to pay for your nephews and nieces education good for you, but do it ONLY after he apologizes for feeling entitled to YOUR inheritance.\n\nAlso can I just point out how nobody mentioned the sentimental value of said assets? They only care about the money! Literally. I think this is the reason why your mother left you more than your siblings, because she knew you are the only decent person among her children. NTA", "It\u2019s your money. Given their track record of taking advantage of your kindness and generosity for financial reasons, their reaction seems par for the course. \n\nI think your contribution was hugely meaningful. \n\nThey got their cut, you got yours. It is not common or required to discuss other recipients of an inheritance what you plan to do with yours.", "NTA and if I didn\u2019t see this behaviour commonly in my line of work I would say you are exaggerating how selfish people can be.\n\nWhether you kept the money or gave it away makes no difference, they should not have been planning on spending that money in the first place.", "NTA, particularly given the nature of the charitable donation (one would hope your siblings would have supported such a donation and contributed themselves, if able)", "Could you have applied the money differently? Absolutely. Was that your decision based on the poor relationship with your mother? Nope! You took it and ultimately did something good with it. Your money, Your choice. NTA", "NTA. And now they even use your nieces and nephews against you, for ur peace of mind, you should cut ties until they know better than claiming their rights on what aint theirs", "NTA. Your Mom left it for you and that\u2019s the end of any debate. You can argue that perhaps investing it into your own kids might be smarter, but idk your financial situation. Ultimately, its still your choice and they can get over themselves.", "the money is yours to do with as you please\n\n&#x200B;\n\nwhatever their grievances are.\n\nnta", "NTA. Your mother left the money to you. What you do with it is your choice.

Instead they would have come again after spending all the inheritance money, begging for you to pay for college using the same nephews as guilt trips.", "No, no, NO! NTA. Your mother distributed the assets as she saw fit, their piggy bank paid them already.\n\nAnd begging your pardon as a gay person who surely has reason to have strong opinions on family and morality, I am going to say that resolving how to honor your relationship with your mother was the bigger priority over your relationship with your siblings. Your and your wife's sentiment are a socially acceptable way to acknowledge a favorable inheritance from an estranged parent (one who lost many years of opportunity to repent), and a decent lesson to pass on to children. I am sorry for the circumstances.", "NTA, your money, you get to decide what to do with it. Tell everyone else to go fuck themselves, with a cactus", "NTA. Your siblings already got their share of the inheritance.", "NTA. It became your money/assets and you dispersed it as you wished. Don\u2019t let your sibling live in your head rent free over this. Go live your life and be happy.", "NTA - Your siblings want their inheritance and are mad that you aren't giving it to them.", "NTA. Your siblings are entitled AHs for thinking they deserved your share. I understand your discomfort with taking your mother\u2019s money due to her behavior toward you. It was your money not your siblings\u2019 money. There was zero obligation to give it to them. It was yours to use in the manner of your choosing. Donating it to research treatments for the disease from which your mother died, is a very reasonable and kind gesture that may help save the lives of others. Your wife was onboard with the idea so the one person that would have the most input was good with the plan. It wouldn\u2019t have been a bad idea to set it aside for your kids but it was your business.", "NTA. I half expected it to be a donation to an organization your mother was against as an act of spite but instead you donated it to a cause to help people suffering the way she did. What an honorable move and I\u2019m honestly in awe of you. \n\nYou\u2019ve been so generous to your siblings already and it\u2019s not your responsibility to send their kids to college. If they weren\u2019t aware of the contents of the will beforehand it sounds like your mother knew they were greedy and had guilt about her relationship with you. You suffered the most at her hand, and you got the most when she died. Your siblings can kick rocks and their kids should take up their lack of college funds with their parents, not you.", "NTA.  \nYour mother left it to you to do with as you see fit. They are not entitled to anything she left you. If you do want to support your nieces/nephews, you could put the money in long-term high-yield savings accounts for their future education, but you\u2019re under no obligation to do so. As far as your siblings are concerned, I wouldn\u2019t let them see a penny.", "The money was left to you, right? Then it's yours to do with as you see fit. NTA.\n\nI'm in a similar situation, and the bulk of my inheritance went to charities that reflect the deceased's interests.", "Nta, its ultimately your decision but one thing i should add is that if your going to give something as charity its better to look around you first and see if there is anyone  in your local vacinity or your immediate circle that might need it. I personally would always give to my family before I give to strangers or organizations because they obviously mean more to me then someone iv never met before but you should make your own judgement and decsion. \n\nAlso you should be aware that most monetsry donations that go to charities get used up in adminstration and very little actually goes toward the intended use.", "NAH\n\nYou can donate your money. But also your family can also be pissed that you thought to donate it before considering their needs.", "I think YTA to your own kids, not to their kids. Even if you don't need the money, your kids could've used it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Inheritance makes matters worse as they'll start to question what the person wanted.\n\nYou're not the asshole but I'd consider the relationship with them ruined. I wouldn't see them ass holes either. If one of my siblings donated my parent's money to charity, I'd see it as an insult in the sense of \"I don't want anything attached to you\".
