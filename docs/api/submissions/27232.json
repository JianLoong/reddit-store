My best friend is 22f and we both work as bartenders at a restaurant in town. There is a man who we\u2019ll call James who is probably 65-70. Most of the bartenders are older than us (35-45) and really like James. Some of them even go to the bar with him after their shift. He\u2019s been coming into my restaurant long before I started working there. All the managers know him and love him.\n\nDespite all of this my best friend and I find him very creepy. He told her she had the nicest ass in the building. He told me I look so much better now that I\u2019ve gained weight (wtf?) and so so much more. He\u2019s a total weirdo. Once my baby sister (15) came to give me something and he made a joke about how he\u2019s surprised my younger sister is even hotter. I could go on and on about this.\n\nAnyways to the story the other day he was sitting at the bar when we came in for our shift, he closed out with the morning bartenders so it was up to us to start serving him. We ignored him for about 10 minutes until the other bartender (a boy who serves him for us because he knows he creeps us out) got there and he started serving him. He had an empty beer for about 2 minutes. Anyways apparently the next day he told all the morning bartenders that we gave him horrible service and just ignored him. When I got there that day they basically went off on us for ignoring guest and \u201cthat\u2019s just not how we do things\u201d. Not that this is relevant but we already don\u2019t get along with these girls. After they did their whole spill I told them if he wasn\u2019t a total creep I would serve him. But he will always get ignored when I\u2019m there. They didn\u2019t like that so they told our manager. My manager told me he\u2019s a nice guy and he doesn\u2019t mean to be weird. But that I can\u2019t not serve him and next time I do we\u2019ll be fired. \n\nI truly can\u2019t afford to lose this job because I\u2019m a broke college student and this is really the only good place to bartend in town. Id make half the money if not less than that working somehwere else. So aita? I\u2019m not stupid enough to think that a man making these comments is just a haha funny joke but am I in the wrong for refusing to serve him when it\u2019s my job? In my opinion creeps don\u2019t deserved to be served. And he was truly just mad a boy served him and not us, he still got great service just not from women .\n\nEdit: thanks everyone for making me feel better. Our gm is a nice guy but he\u2019s honestly a little bit of a creep too, that\u2019s probably why he doesn\u2019t see anything wrong. Our owner is a cool guy that really likes me and my friend so I think I\u2019m going to tell him everything that\u2019s going on.

Maybe the owner is actually really great and upstanding and will take this very seriously, but in all likelihood he will not.
