She's the oldest of 6 and all my aunts and uncle are pretty tight knit. This specific issue is mainly about my aunt, who I'll call Katie (39f). Katie's daughter is my cousin, I'll call her Ella (16f), and I'll call my sister Marie (25f). I have a very good relationship with my cousins but my sister and I are not only siblings, but best friends.\n\nKatie and my (former) uncle filed for divorce, and it's getting kind of messy. Katie is struggling coming to terms with everything (he was a cheater) and this impacted Ella as well, obviously. My mom and other aunts have been spending a lot of time with Katie and Ella, supporting them and making them feel better. Everything has been about 'how do we support Ella', 'how do we make them feel loved' and all that.\n\nMy brother in law died a few months ago. I'm still trying to process this because he was like a big brother to me, and Marie is not doing so great. She's started seeing a grief therapist, which is a solid start, but she still gets panic attacks and starts crying randomly. Marie is strong though and I'm trying my best to support her.\n\nSo Ella had a surprise sweet 16 last week, which was organized by Katie and mom. Mom asked Marie to come as well and she might feel better with everyone else around, she said she'd think about it but didn't end up coming. I was going to go to the restaurant after work (to be in time for when Ella came in and we all yelled surprise and stuff). However I got a text from Marie saying she was feeling sick, and if I had some time to come see her. (side note, feeling sick means emotionally, she's okay physically)\n\nI said I'd be around after I got off work, and I texted mom letting her know I'd be late for the party. I spent a couple of hours with Marie watching a rom com and drove to the restaurant after.\n\nKatie said I told them I'd be there for when Ella came in, and she was hurt when she realized I didn't show. I told them I texted mom I'd be late, but mom said she talked to Marie and she (Marie) was fine, and it wouldn't have hurt if I went to visit her later. I apologized and let it go. Mom later said I let Ella down and I've never been in this situation so I don't understand how Ella and Katie must be feeling right now.\n\nI got pissed at that point and said it's really great she has so much empathy for her divorced sister, but absolutely none at all for her widowed daughter.\n\nThat didn't go over well and mom got mad at me.

Your texted your mom, she texted Marie, and somehow neglected to text you back for clarification when Marie said she was ok?

I think I get why you're wondering if you're the asshole, but I think the fact that you even think that shows that you're really not. It's a terrible situation for your family to be in and it's understandable that people might not always express themselves in the best or kindest ways.\n\nThe thing is, what she did is just objectively worse. I don't really care if doing all this other stuff is some kind of coping mechanism for her, she really can't expect you to fall in line with that and so her actions and responses are decidedly worse.\n\nWhat gets me is that she felt the need to bring it up later. I think there's some serious lack of self-awareness occurring, and I hope that it doesn't end up causing lasting resentment. It's a terrible thing that happened to your family, and whether she realizes it or not, letting herself respond this way is could very well make it a longer road to recovery.\n\nI'm so sorry for your sister's loss (your loss as well, of course.) \n\nYou're a wonderful person for being there to help her through this. It's a shame your mom doesn't recognize that as much as she should.", "Not just NTA, but totally justified.\n\nIt's already bad enough your mom clearly puts way more time and effort into her sister and niece than into her own grieving child, but telling you off for not making them a priority as well, WTF!

You should have told her she clearly doesn't understand what Marie is going through right now, as her own husband is still alive and well.", "NTA. Your mother doesn't seem to understand what being a mother is. Instead she has chosen to be a sister and can't do 2 things at the same time. How dare you expect her to have empathy for someone she gave birth to. /s \n\nYou and your sister may want to go LC with your mother for a while til your sister has weathered the worst of the storm. Your mother's heartlessness won't be a healthy thing to be around. Be the support your sister needs and to hell with your mother's entitlement.", "NTA. You said exactly the right thing.", "NTA\n\nNo matter how painful, a divorce is to some extent a choice; for some it's freedom, for others it's empowering, for still others, it's the only remaining solution to a problem. I'm not disrespecting how awful it can be to go through it but someone took a decision to start the process.\n\nThe death of a partner is not that. It's not a choice. As a comment below said, it's gut wrenching, a huge loss and turns the surviving partner's life into a nightmare that has to be endured till a path out of the grief emerges. \n\nYour mother has selective empathy but that's her problem, not yours. Never feel guilty for supporting your sister when she needs it.", "Apologize to your mom. Both of you are surrounded by depressed family members. It can be exhausting for caregivers. You and mom are more alike than you realize OP. NTA just burned out.", ">Sure, maybe your dad thinks that perhaps what you said could be a bit   \nmore tactful, but as a whole it wasn\u2019t your fault that Ella was let down\n\nThis is a good way to put it. It's really an unfair comparison here in terms of blame. OP wants to be there to support her sister more than being at her cousin's birthday. I think that's reasonable. Just like her response being tactless was less bad than the mother's implicit dismissal of the situation. \n\nI think the whole family is probably going to be prone to being less-than-perfect with their interactions, given the circumstances. But, at least OP seems to be very aware of what part she plays. The fact she even considers if she was being an asshole to me says enough. I think she needs to make sure she gives herself credit and should know she's not the asshole here at all.", "THIS, very well said.", "Agreed, I think if anything like this comes up again pointing out that bit about the sisters might be a good idea, I would hope she could understand that. Unfortunately, the mother's self-awareness might be a little lacking if she doesn't realize that being there for her sister that's literally still having panic attacks is a bit more important than a birthday.", ">After you apologized, she should have dropped it.\n\nThis, so much this. The comment wasn't nice, but the mother's reaction was far worse. She is trying to support her sister. OP is trying to support her sister. It also just so happens the OPs sister is the mother's daughter (wow, that's how family works). \n\nThe mother is the one more in the wrong on all counts, and I don't think what the OP said was even that bad, given the mother's actions support her conclusion. \n\nI'm sure the mother cares about her daughter, and it's probably why she got mad. Thing is, she needs to understand how her actions look. OPs mom owes HER an apology, now.", "This. NTA!", "I'm sorry to hear that. That sounds really alienating -- especially coming from someone who's supposed to care for you deeply.\n\n>I get how frustrating it is when your mum's version of 'helping and being generous to family.' doesn't extend to you.\n\nI've been fortunate enough to have my immediate family be caring, but due to life circumstances I ended up being raised a bit further from my extended family (despite everyone but me and my sister being close to them, even as cousins). I won't get too into it because your story is a bit more relevant.\n\nAnyway, if the situation isn't too bad you could try being the one to reach out a little more. I don't know what your mother is like, maybe they just constantly keep in touch and so are on her mind more (not an excuse, some people are like that regardless of whether it's reasonable...)\n\nAlso, if you're still close and they just get more from her, maybe you should look at what they actually ask for/do. If you're always trying to be positive and they talk about their troubles more maybe she's just misinformed. I could be being to positive though; I don't know her, you do.\n\nGood luck out there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: wording in first paragraph", ">My mum also comes from a tight-knit family and it sometimes feels like we, her children, are second family. We struggle to pay for uni or find a house but she donates money to her siblings and their kids. She helps them buy land, go on vacations etc.\n\nKinda reminds me of my dad. He took good care of my cousins during childhood. Helped fund their care when they were kids, paid for them to go to uni, took them out to places etc. But he wasn't around much for my own childhood and never paid my mum child support. \n\nIn all fairness my cousins live in a country with a lower cost of living + exchange rates are favourable for us, his sister (their mum) died when they were babies/toddlers and their dad is poor. So I understand why he supported them. But it did hurt that he was never around for me and my brother as much.", "OP did apologize at first. Her mom didn't accept it, which lead to the last bit. Mom needs to apologize too. I hope they can make up and move forward, but I do think the mom is more of an asshole here.", "Thank you for the advice. I will try and reach out and talk. We talk and I have tried bringing up my issues but she says I need to 'stop being a victim' and 'life isn't the way you remember it.' But I will try and just do it without getting emotional. And I'm glad you have an amazing extended family, I hope you continue to have a great relationship.", "Me too . Thank you for clarifying.", "I think what you said is a great idea, I think the most important thing is just trying to have a good relationship.

Just make sure not to let yourself get hurt too many times because you want to assume the best. I will trust you to be good to yourself!\n\nAlso, this is no big deal but I slightly messed up my comment wording. Yes, my relationship with them is fine, but I accidentally made it look like we were close when really it's kinda the opposite. Everyone else is close throughout the extended family but me and my sister. It's all good, though. Maybe I should reach out to them too actually.", "NTA\n\nYour mother is right now tunnelvisioning her sister and nephew to a point i presume she has exactly 0 interest in what your sister is going through.\n\nIf she ever has shown that to your sister I am not suprised she did not tell her she is felling like shit\n\nHuge applause to you that you are not losing your sister out of your focus.\nI understand that getting cheated on and divorcing is not fun but I don't think the pain is even remotely near losing his partner forever.", "NTA.

There was nothing urgent or special about that date and time other than a family celebration you agreed to attend.\n\nLooks like Marie decided it was important to have you disappoint everyone in order to be with her.  Expecting Ella\u2019s mom to postpone the celebration For Ella, or to thumb your nose at family by being rudely late and then making it all worse by suggesting that Katie was not supportive of Marie because she had a celebration for her daughter was pretty mean.\n\nMarie\u2019s troubles are worth support of Marie.  Exactly what will satisfy you and Marie in terms of the entire family not living life for as long as it takes for Marie to feel better?", "NTA- and I would just tell Dad. If she doesn't stop coming at me, then I have no choice but to tell her exactly what impact she's having on her own children. Yes, I did have to tell her that because she was attacking me and showing no empathy for her own daughter. She needs to know that because if she doesn't stop she can damage her own relationships.", "to add to #2\n\nMom probably isn't in that circle so will most likely always get \"I'm fine\" responses. As the elder daughter she knows her mother and knows she's not supportive. Dad knows it too as he agreed with the comments and thought bringing it up was a bad idea.\n\n I'm sure Ella will understand her sister needed her, she had everyone else at the party, she will get over it.", "Your mother may also want to consider the implications of her older daughter not wanting her for emotional support. NTA", "I understand that, but the timing of Marie\u2019s crisis is interesting. It happened at a time when she knew the rest of the family was celebrating the sweet 16 party. \n\nObviously, death trumps a birthday party but still. Maybe OP should have attended the party, but hung out with Marie either before or after.", "Disagree with that. A 16 year old should get a birthday party. It\u2019s a very big deal for a teenage girl. Even without the additional struggle of her parents having a messy divorce. Aunt becoming a widow really doesn\u2019t rationalize her not getting a party. OP\u2019s mom is the AH for being pushy not for throwing the party or inviting the Aunt.", "Sorry, but I don't buy that a divorce can be a stressful as a death. People who are getting divorced are still alive; people who have died are dead. There is no comparison.", "Exactly -\u201cYou were right, and I agree with you, but you know your mother so please don\u2019t rock the boat\u201d.  \ud83d\ude44", "I wouldn't have apologised to this AH mother. Her own bereaved daughter should come first. Yes, it sucks that her sister was married to a cheater but her daughter lost her husband at such a young age.", "Marie called her sister at work saying she was sick, not during the party. Her sister couldn't come to her until after work.", "That's  . . .literally what she did", "The cousin gets a party. Aunt gets invited, declines because they are in mourning. Her daughter just became a widow. People will understand.", "OP wasn\u2019t there for the big surprise entrance. That\u2019s why family was upset.", "NTA.\n\nGrief and loss like that is something where if they aren't feeling well, they absolutely should not be alone. A relative lost her son too early on and I went and gave her a surprise visit one day because I felt I needed to and it turned out she'd been struggling that day.\n\nBesides, sweet 16 is just another birthday that people hype up for some reason. Someone going through grief should come first. You didn't skip the party, you were just late.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nYour dad is wrong.  \n\nOf Course you should have said it.  She needs to hear it.   Hopefully it will sink in.\n\nYour a great sister supporting her while she goes through such a difficult and painful time in her life.", "NTA.  \n\nYou said truth.  \n\nYour mother was obsessing over you being late for a party, because you were helping someone that needed help.  **Your mother was putting a Want ahead of a NEED.**  \n\n**You were giving support and encouragement to someone suffering.**  You did show up at the party, to congratulate the cousin.   **You made a loving choice, and your mother should have respected it, not criticized and blamed you for it.**  \n\nYou spoke truth.  If your mother can't handle it, she can get a therapist to find out why **she's prioritizing her siblings and their children instead of her own.**  I include you in that, because you shouldn't have been treated this way by your mother, either.", "NTA.  Mom is being an AH.  Dad is being a coward.  Look after your sister...", "NTA and you are fully right. Your mom cares more about her sister than her own kids and needs to be called on her shit.", "NTA. Your mom needed to hear it.", "100% NTA!", "NTA. Good for you for being there for your sister and for having the only spine in the (rest) of the family as well.", "NTA. Marie is only 25 and lost her husband?? That\u2019s huge. I\u2019m sorry Ella\u2019s parents are getting divorced but it is not the same thing at all.", "NTA.  Your mom needed to hear it and if it hurt her feelings, then maybe she'll think about what she's done wrong here.  It sucks Ella is watching her parents' divorce, but your sister lost her spouse.  That is a huge difference.  Ella will still have both of them, even if they are divorced.  Talk with Ella about what all went down, because she probably is more understanding and may have the empathy your mom and aunt lack.", "NTA. I would simply replay: \"I saw Ella. She was doing great. It didn't hurt I was late, did it?\" and enjoyed calling out her hypocrisy if she replayed", "NTA your mom can't dish out the big guilt trip and not expect one back.", "Your dad gets where you\u2019re coming from but wishes you hadn\u2019t spoken then because when they get home he has to deal with I\u2019m guessing more unwanted drama. He probably would have supported you but I\u2019m sure he just doesn\u2019t want to deal with that kind of drama. \n\nI\u2019m not so knowledgeable about your family dynamics that I\u2019d understand how it would have played out but still - NTA", "You did the right thing. Both situations hurt but im sorry you can't even compare the pain of divorce to the pain from the death of your spouse. NTA", "Newly grieving sister trumps any party.\n\nYou'd fit in well with OPs poor excuse for a mother.", "That. Grief is open wound. I would bite and feel no remorse. I despise this mother, who would choose not to comfort grieving daughter but niece's party?! What a nightmare mother.", "I thought it was common knowledge that death of a loved one and divorce were the two most stressful events a person could go through?", "True", "The claim wasn't that a divorce is as *bad* as a death, only that it's as *stressful*. Divorces can involve a whole host of arguments and are often drawn out over years.", "Oh my bad I misread your comment. You were saying OP's mom shouldn't have attended the party, not that the niece shouldn't have gotten a party thrown for her. I still disagree, I don't think MIL needs to be in a mourning period of wearing black/not attending parties b/c her son-in-law died if she's not genuinely going through those emotions. Not even in earlier centuries would this be required etiquette. If OP's mom's hypothetical husband of a few years died (who didn't raise the kids), would her kids join her in a mourning period for him?  \n\n\nAlso keep in mind that by OP's own words, OP's mom is close to Katie and OP is close to Marie and that's why they are each prioritizing these respective person's problems. You lean on the person you're close to and you prioritize the person you have a strong bond with. It's the personal strength of the relationship that matters, not the on-paper degree of separation. You can be closer to a sibling than an adult child. That doesn't make someone an AH.   \n\n\n>She's the oldest of 6 and **all my aunts and uncle are pretty tight knit**  \n I have a very good relationship with my cousins bu**t my sister and I are not only siblings, but best friends**.", "\"the two most stressful events\" doesn't mean they are equally stressful, though.", "And? The fact is that she showed up. It's honestly ridiculous that people think if your appearance at an event isn't exactly on their terms, it doesn't count. \n\nOP was comforting her bereaved sister. Her sister may have been thinking about how she'd go to that event with her husband, a man she's getting used to not being around, and that triggered her. OP did the right thing, she was there for Marie and Ella, but Ella, her mother and OP's mother want to nitpick.", "If you are going to preface your point by saying that a mother prefers her niece over her daughter (with no justification of repeated bad behavior), then the mother is an asshole to begin with. Then all actions of telling her widowed daughter to celebrate months after her husband's death are just logical behavior for such a person.", "Not all the time, but it can be.  Depends on the people involved. I can imagine there are plenty of people who would have preferred to be widows/widowers than going through whatever hell their exes dragged them through before, during, and after a divorce.", "Well, yes, it did occur to me that if OP showed up for the reveal then left early, she would get yelled at for that as well.", "Another way to think of it is perspective in scale. I believe death is definitely worse in what is otherwise a happy marriage but to a divorcee, especially an unwilling one, it is likely the worst thing they\u2019ve experienced and it has a similar effect with upending how you thought the rest of your life was going to go. In that way they are very similar. It is difficult to rationalize past though.", "Exactly. OP could not win, and I wouldn't put it past mommy dearest to tell Marie off if OP left early to see her, or to pressure Marie by saying OP was there so Marie should just go. \n\nMarie is going through something horrendous and her mother is more invested in someone else's child. She is backing her sister and supporting her, but telling OP for supporting her own sister. The mother is a hypocrite and the aunt and Ella need to understand that the universe doesn't revolve around them. Yes, divorce is awful, but bereavement is the worst. \n\nOP's mother just didn't like hearing the truth and having to consider that she's being selfish and hypocritical. OP is giving her sister some much needed support and TLC and was still there for Ella as well.", "The thing is, I don\u2019t know how big of a deal a sweet 16 event is to OP\u2019s family. Maybe it\u2019s just another birthday party, or maybe it\u2019s like a wedding or a bar mitzvah. Without knowing the cultural context, I don\u2019t think we should be calling mom a hypocrite.", "A sweet 16 is second to the death of a spouse. It's a bloody party. Marie lost her partner and soul mate. Ella has her entire future ahead of her, whilst Marie is facing the fact that all her plans for her future died with her husband, and she has to readjust those plans to factor in that reality that he isn't there. \n\nThe mother is a hypocrite. She can see that a divorce would hurt her sister and Ella and she's all about supporting them, but Marie, her daughter, is grieving and her mother is too busy worrying about a bloody party. She can support and empathise with someone else's daughter, but not her own. She can place her sister over her family, but OP is supposed to care more about a party than her own sister. She is a hypocrite because it is one rule for her and another for everyone else.\n\nCultural context does not factor in because again, OP went to the party. She just wasn't there to yell surprise. That's it. That's what this nonsense is about. She wasn't there to yell surprise because she was looking after her sister, and now the sky is falling for Ella, her mother and OP's mother. Literally, their logic:\n\nThem: You weren't there to shout surprise. How could you?\n\nOP: But I came to the party. \n\nThem: But you didn't shout surprise. \n\nOP: Yes, but I was there later. My sister needed me. \n\nThem: BUT YOU DIDN'T SHOUT SURPRISE!!!!! Ella is hurt that you didn't shout surprise.\n\nOP: My sister is hurt her husband is dead. \n\nThem: You didn't shout surprise. You're selfish.", "NTA.\n\nBoth are important losses and should be respected as such but your mother has her priorities messed up, I think.\n\nYour sister probably said she was ok to your mom because she sees how little mom cares for her in comparison to the aunt and cousin so, why bother if she won't show up? I'd do the same.\n\nBest wishes for you and your sister, OP.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA, you said the truth. Right now, I'm sorry, but it sounds like Marie needs way more support and apparently nobody in your family cares but you. You did the right thing going to her, you did the right thing telling your mom off and I'd say it again and again until it maybe sinks in what a shitty mother she's being.", "NTA\n\nDeath and divorce are two of the worst things to go through.  Your sister is a YOUNG widow, though, which makes it worse.\n\nDo what you believe is best.  Sounds like your sister needs you more though.", "NTA\n\nJust because Marie is an adult doesn't mean that the loss hurts less.", "NTA. You rightfully put your mother in her place. Who cares if she gets mad. So what you were late she has no business talking to you like that for being late to a sweet sixteen party. She needs to get her shit together before she irreparably damages the relationship she has with her daughters.", "I think you should have done the same things, but in the opposite order; you should have been there for the surprise, and gone to your sister\u2019s afterwards. Her heartache isn\u2019t going anywhere, but the surprise was a fleeting moment in time, that you missed. I\u2019m going to say ESH, but only a little bit, because I think you all really do love each other. I hope you\u2019re all able to forgive and move on, and I\u2019m sending love to your sister; may her heart heal in time.", "NTA - You're a great sibling. I'm so sorry for your and your sister's loss.", "My reaction to you, my dear OP?\n\nFACTS queen, you dropped this \ud83d\udc51 \n\nGood on you for being there for your sister, I'm glad she has you. NTA", "NTA - she needs a slap of reality right now. Well done!", "NTA. Your mom wants to be bossy and judgemental, she can do that with her sister. I understand  she's close with her sister.  You seem to be close with your sister too and while having a cheating husband is hard, your sister lost much more. Is your mom's sister going to take care of her in her old age?  No, then maybe mom should start focusing on the relationship she has with her daughters.", "NTA.  In the list of responsibilities comforting your sister who's mourning a recently deceased spouse comes in significantly higher than missing a cousin's sweet 16 party.  Your dad knows it and so does your mom.  She's mad that you called her out.  The fact that your sister didn't tell your mom that she was emotionally vunerable says a lot about their relationship.  Apparently for your mom supporting her sister and niece comes before comforting her own daughter.", "NTA but your mom is.", "NTA and everything said was true", "NTA. She needed to hear this. Maybe ask her what she thinks why your sister told her that she\u2019s \u201cok\u201d.", "NTA Why shouldn't you have said that? It's the truth. I doubt your not being there impacted the party. Your being there for your sister helped.\n\nYour mom is TA and needed to hear some truth.", "NTA But WTF is with parents who say \"I agree with you but you shouldn't offend insert-name-here.\" WHY? Assholes are assholes & rarely deaerve respect or even consideration. Fuck 'em, OP", "NTA", "NTA", "Ahh, but is she his? there's a 7 year age gaps between sisters and just because she doesn't refer to her/think of her as a half-sister doesn't mean they had the same father.\n\nNTA OP at all. Your mother put her sister and niece first over her daughter, You put YOUR sister first. I guess that's kind of even. She's putting an ongoing divorce and the confusion and pain of a 16yo(very valid pain and need to comfort) over the grief of a young widow who suddenly lost her husband.... Yeah, that's not equitable at all. If you don't live in her house I would go NC, spend as much time with her as possible and maybe encourage your sister to go LC with your mother so she doesn't shove her foot farther into her mouth.", "There can be large age gaps between children and they be from the same parents. What a weird note to add, especially with it being so relevant. \nPs. 2 of my siblings were adults before I was born...we all have the same parents. \n\nNTA to OP and you are a wonderful sister and I am so sorry for you and your sister's loss.", "It's not even that they want to nitpick, it seems like they have NO EMPATHY for Marie. Like nobody cares the woman had just lost her husband? TO DEATH. Like, FOR GOOD. And these people can't be arsed to care one bit about that? I'm fucking speechless. The lot of them deserve nothing.", "The mom is an asshole for being pushy about Marie attending Elle's party and giving OP grief about showing up late when she gave a heads-up via text. But that's it. Mom is not an AH for going to her niece's party. That was all I was saying.", "Exactly. They nitpicking about when OP got to the party rather than being worried about and supporting Marie. It's insane."]}
