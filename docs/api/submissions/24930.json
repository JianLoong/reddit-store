I would say up until a year ago our relationship was good. I love my sister and we'd often hang out together without being forced to. We both liked video games so it was always cool to have that to do together, where both of us could have fun instead of one liking it more. My parents didn't let my sister play every game, because she can be kinda gullible and anything that would involve possibly running across strangers was a no no with her. Which I got because people can be weird in MMOs and other online games.\n\nAbout a year ago my sister started showing signs of pretty extreme jealousy whenever I'd play video games with my friends. She became so possessive. She'd ask me not to play with them and when I would tell her we had already played together or I'd play with her later, and I always followed through on that btw, she would pout and act all whiny and sometimes even through a mini tantrum.\n\nA while after this started and I had made several attempts to talk to her, she started being rude to my friends. If they were over at our house or she saw them when we'd walk home from school together she would give them some real side eye and attitude, she'd ignore them even and would make faces if I called her on it.\n\nShe shut the door in my best friends face like a dozen times and she even disconnected the modem in the middle of our games sometimes. It made me start to dislike my sister and after so many attempts of trying to figure out why she was acting out and even getting our parents involved, I started playing with her less because I was sick of her attitude and hated being around her.\n\nA couple of weeks ago she stooped to a whole new level. When we were all supposed to be in bed she snuck into the office and used the family computer to create a bunch of fake accounts and then mass reported my friends in almost every online sever we played on. Some of them she made her own accounts to make the reports more believable. Dad caught her at around 5am that morning.\n\nOur parents were furious with her because she went into some of the games she was not allowed to touch for safety reasons. But me? I was the one who had to call and tell my friends what she'd done and I was so damn pissed. I didn't want to be around her at all for a couple of days and my parents told me we'd need to talk. She gave a weak ass apology and I told her it wasn't good enough and that I was never playing games with her again after the stunt she pulled. She started to cry and I told her that actions have consequences and she had a year to come and tell me what had crawled up her butt and I had to find a way to make it up to my friends because of her. She was so upset and pleaded with me to give her another chance. I ignored it and now my parents are unhappy with me. They say I'm being too harsh and give it a few weeks or months but let her come back from this.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1692349224, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15uf498/aita_for_making_my_sister_cry_by_saying_ill_never/", "score": 26, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I said this because she mass reported my friends and got some of them banned from some games and she did it out of some weird jealousy.

Like on Steam, if your account is banned they can actually REVOKE OWNERSHIP of all games you purchased. You do not OWN the games you have, you own the account which has ACCESS to the games.\n\nSimilarly some online MMOs can have real world value to the accounts, and being banned and unable to recover your account can cost real world money to undo, not to mention the hours on hours of content you've already completed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are 100% correct, actions have consequences and adolescents need to learn that lesson. If she acts horribly to someone and ruins their stuff, they lose access to it and those people.  \n\n\nETA: Maybe don't ban her FOREVER but at least until she comes to learn the full extent of her actions and actually comes to regret it. Don't let up over some half assed apology, but forever might be a little overkill.", "This is beyond being jealous of an older brother playing games that she cannot.  This has been an escalating pattern culminating in fake accounts and malicious accusations.  I think there more here than meets the eye and your parents might want to have a couple therapy sessions with your sister as a check. \n\nMy son has played online for years and getting accounts banned is a huge deal. It results in loss of money and achievements and things I don\u2019t even understand (I am a parent lol).   I understand your anger and loss of trust.  It may be possible for the account(s) to be unbanned if explanations are offered about your sister\u2019s fake accounts.  As for the money she has cost them, your parents need to look at making them whole again. Refunding the cost of games lost. Etc.  There should also be a conversation with the other parents by your parents explaining the situation so your friends don\u2019t get in trouble if their parents think there is any truth to the accusations. \n\nWhat your sister did was calculated and malicious. She got up in the middle of the night to do this ! And it was directed at your friends on purpose. To maybe destroy those relationships? This goes way beyond jealousy over not being able to play the same games as you.  \n\nI hope your parents are taking a serious look at this and don\u2019t try to sweep if under the rug because \u201cshe is young\u201d.

My parents were surprised when I said they'd need to reach out and see how much money was lost. They don't fully understand either and it took me explaining it all to them. I'm not sure they fully understand it even now.\n\nI think it was my sister's way of \"punishing\" my friends. But it could be an effort to destroy all my friendships too. These guys have been my friends since most of us were in kindy.", "I'm honestly not sure if she can regain my trust. Right up to this she has still been treating my friends like shit. She has been rude to them for no reason and now she has cost them the ability to play some games, and tried to get them banned from a bunch of them. So it would take a lot and might be impossible for me to fully trust her after this.", "She has friends of her own, yeah, and she plays with them without issue.\n\nShe had a couple of problems in school related to my friends and the times the high school and middle schools interacted for anything. But only regarding my friends. No other school issues.", "So in online games with chat features you can often report players if they're being creeps or doing something inappropriate. My sister created a bunch of fake accounts and did this until my friends were banned from certain games/servers. Some of them she didn't actually have any luck in, because lots of them now have things in place to prevent fake reports like that. But there are others that if enough reports come in they will just ban the person which is what happened here. Some they can still play but others they were banned from.", "Punishing your friends just leads me to believe there are deeper issues. Does you sister have a core group of friends? People that she socializes with? I know you are still a \u201ckid\u201d but keep trying to have a dialogue with parents about this.", "I get it.  She hurt you she went after your friend and they are pissed. You have to live with the consequences of HER actions.\n\nUnless you move out, you still have to live with her for a few years.\n\nRegaining your trust should not come easy.\n\nI am OLD.  I remember being the youngest of 4 sibs and 13 yo, and was a bratty and whiney too.  Would I have hurt my siblings like this?  I hope not.  But I was just a kid.\n\nI don't think your anger is unjustified.  From what you have said, your sister was way out of line, and at 13 you expected her to know better than mess with your friends.\n\nKids do change.  They can mature and grow up.  The can learn empathy and compassion.\n\nTake it one day at aa time.  You do not have to play games with her ever again.  It is your boundary that needed to be set up due to her actions.\n\nETA:  The longer I think about it.  I agree that you sister was pretty awful.\n\nParents tend to forgive their children far more rapidly than a sibling would.  \n\nThey will likely put pressure on you in the future to  trust you sister again;.\n\nIs there a way for you to put the games that I assume you paid for, and she is not allowed to pay in some sort of locked container?\n\nIs there a way to prevent her from regain access to your accounts?"]}
