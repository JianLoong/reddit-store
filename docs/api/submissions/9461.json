He went no-contact with me when I moved out for college, and in those years without contact I realized how wrong my behavior was and started therapy. I\u2019ve since expressed my remorse and desire to make amends to my brother, but he\u2019s declined any further contact.\n\nFor family events in the years since he went no-contact with me, we\u2019ve sort of traded off. He\u2019ll go to one thing, I\u2019ll go to the next. But my mom is getting remarried in the fall, and obviously she wants us both to be there. I\u2019ve told my mom that I\u2019ll do whatever I can do make it possible for both of us to be there. If he doesn\u2019t want to talk to me at the event, I\u2019ll do my best to make myself scarce when he\u2019s around. But it\u2019s looking increasingly like my brother will choose not to attend if I\u2019m there.\n\nMy therapist wants me to stand my ground and go anyway, but I\u2019m feeling really guilty about it, especially since the estrangement is entirely my fault. My brother has good reasons for not wanting to see me. I\u2019m remorseful now, but for many years in our childhood I treated him terribly. I feel like choosing to go is sending him the message that I\u2019m more important to the family than he is.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the perspectives, guys.

It seems needlessly confrontational/aggressive? I don't know anything about therapy though", "NAH - everyone is wounded here. But this isn't trading off every other birthday - this is a one time event. Your brother certainly doesn't need to forgive you to attend and your offer to stay as far away from him is generous. You can be in opposite sides of the room, don't share in any photos, and be there only for your mom.\n\nOne caveat - since we don't know the extent of your bullying (and we don't need the details here), if it was truly heinous and unforgivable, then maybe you should stay home.", "NAH except your mother.

The biggest loser here is your mother, although I imagine that she bears some responsibility for the bullying getting to the extent that you\u2019re now no-contact. \n\nI would ask her what she wants to do. Not as in \u201cpick which one of her children comes to her wedding\u201d, as in would she like to talk to him about both of you going and being completely separated the entire time? To what degree is she willing to make a specific request not to mend a bridge but to figure out what will happen without all of the guessing?", "Maybe you can do shifts or something like you go to ceremony and he goes to reception ? Just a thought. I would say NAH because altho you messed up in the past, you are taking steps to fix the issue and its your brothers choice to be NC or not.", "i feel like this is 99% on the mom. she allowed OP to bully, and now has zero concern for the youngest. To me it makes most sense for him to not go. He stated and confirmed he won't go if OP is there. OP is invited, so that is mom making her pick. \n\nI don't see the brother as the AH since i asume based on OP statement that the bullying was not a few offhand remarks, and he has the right to not want contact. \n\nOP is sorry, said so to brother and is trying to make aments, so while he was the AH in the past, he is not now.", "YTA for the bullying alone, and depending on the type of bullying, that's how much of an AH.\n\nWithout the bullying history this would be an easy choice.\n\nIt's mom's wedding. Mom wants both of you there. You can't both be there if you don't attend, so obviously you attend.\n\nHowever... it's your brother's trauma. He might not be *able* to attend if you're there. \n\nThen again, we don't know the extent of the bullying or how old you were as kids when it happened and if he's \"punishing\" you for normal sibling stupidity.\n\nThe fact that's it is almost always pretty serious when people go NC, leads me to think it's the former, and you should stay home.\n\nYour therapist telling you to \"stand your ground\" makes me think it might be the latter. In which case you should go.\n\nBut mostly I'm thinking this shouldn't be your decision at all.\n\nYour mother needs to accept that both of you *will not* be in the same room. So she's going to need to decide what to do about that. Whether it's taking shifts or telling one of you to stay home.\n\nIt's her choice.\n\nBut that's a hard choice to make between your children, especially for a wedding.\n\nPersonally, for me, making that choice would be harder than not having either of you there.\n\nSo really, you have the opportunity to either spare your mother from making that choice or not.\n\nAnd since you are stating unequivocally that you're the one at fault... I'd say you're the one who needs to miss out.\n\nBut again, we don't know what the bullying was?! So?! but yeah, pretty sure YTA here... \n\nopen to a changing of the mind, though.", "In this specific situation you're NTA. Unlike most of Reddit, I believe people can change.

At this point, there's really nothing else you can do. \n\nIf he wants to skip his mom's wedding because he is unable to be in the same space as you, then so be it. \n\nI will say this though - DO NOT MAKE YOUR MOTHER CHOOSE BETWEEN HER CHILDREN.", "NAH. Sometimes this sub is so full of itself. Mom wants both of them, therapist thinks it's ok. Maybe they know more than 3 paragraphs of context.\n\nIMO, it's totally understandable that your brother isn't over the shit you put him through, he might never be and that's ok. It also sounds like you're trying to make amends as best you can. All that said, I do think that if you can't work out some sort of shifts thing (maybe one attends ceremony and one attends reception) the best move would be to let him go and stay home. You are ultimately the one that created the situation originally, and if you're lucky it might be a step towards building back some good will.", "YTA.\n\nYour actions have consequences. It does not matter that you want to make amends. He doesn't. You bullied him for an extensive amount of time. You knew what you were doing, and yet you didn't stop. It took you leaving for college for him to have any sort of respite from your harassment. \n\nWhile it's great that you're attending therapy and working towards being a better person, that doesn't change what you did to him. \n\nYou're going to have to let your mom be the one who decides. Honestly, the fact that she allowed you to treat your brother the way you did does not bode well with me. Did she not once try to intervene on his behalf?", "WNBTA\n\nObviously, you made some mistakes & you are owning responsibility for those mistakes. Your brother will need to decide for himself how he chooses to move forward. Maybe he never forgives you, that\u2019s his choice, but he can\u2019t control the fact that you share a mother. Her wedding day is not about you & your brother\u2019s issues. You should both do your best to make it special for your Mom.", "YTA if you go and cause him to not attend.\n\nYou hit the nail on the head with your final sentence: If you choose to go, you're putting yourself above him. If he wants to bury the hatchet for the singular event, then of course that's for the best. But if he can't - and unfortunately for you, he's totally within his rights to not want to do so - then you should respect that and find another way to honor your mom. Actions have consequences, and this is one of the consequences of bullying someone.\n\nYou're not owed forgiveness, and to your credit you don't seem to believe you are. If your brother ever chooses to try to mend your relationship, you will have to allow him to dictate the terms of that. And right now, the terms of your relationship are that you don't share spaces.\n\nFor now, all you can do is support your brother in whatever choice he makes re: your mom's wedding. If he has any desire to go - and it sounds like he does - communicate to him that you will not be there.", "YTA\n\nActions have consequences, long term.\n\nTalk to your mother about this.  Let HER decide how to proceed.\n\nShe should be the one to talk with your brother and see if he can tolerate being at the same event with you.

Just because you were an AH previously doesn\u2019t mean you have to make allowances for your brother all the time.  Your mother wants you both there.  He can avoid you but him not showing up would be his decision.  If you don\u2019t show up your mom still doesn\u2019t get what she wants.\n\nIf you do send the message though you would be the AH.", "I think you would be YTA if you went, even though it sounds like you're trying, you did the things that made him go NC and this is the type of thing you have to live with for now. See your mom and her partner some other time.", "Sadly, YWTA if you attended your mother's wedding. But -\nit seems as if you were deeply remorseful, you went to therapy, own what you did to your brother and tried to make amends. I think you know that you're not entitled to your brother's forgiveness, and you seem to respect that. That's why I think not attending your mother's wedding so that your brother can go would be a wonderful way to show him you care for him, that his happiness is important for you and in that case more important than your own happiness.", "NAH. Well, specifically in this case, not your past, but you are already aware of that.\n\nYour mom has invited you both. She's the important one at her wedding (along with the groom, obviously). If she asked you not to attend, then you should respect that - but she has not done that, so you're in the clear on that end. You are also willing to do you part to minimize impact on him, which seems appropriate from the way you describe this situation. As long as you wouldn't force any unwanted interaction, I'd say you're ok in attending.\n\nOne possible option, if you can get messages between you and your brother: Can you each attend half? Or perhaps both attend the ceremony, then one of you bow out after congratulating the couple (it would probably be you who bows out early, from what I'm seeing).\n\nUltimately the decision is his, and his alone. You still exist and have a right to be there", "yes you would be, altho yes your mom wants both of you there, in these cases it is best to defer to the victim not the perpertrator of the abuse, think of it as concequences for you being  such a bully", "I'm leaning towards NTA.\n\nYes, you were an asshole in the past, but that doesn't mean you're one in this specific situation.\n\nIt seems you're willing to compromise here, while your brother isn't. That's his right to choose. But it doesn't sound like you would even interact with him. So it kinda seems like he's putting his want to not be in the same room as you over being there at his mother's wedding. Which I kinda think is an asshole thing to do.\n\nWhen there's a situation like this, I tend to side with the person who's willing to make a compromise over the one who isn't.", "That's a tough one.  Can your mom have someone have you on video chat so you can watch instead of attend then take her, and her partner out to dinner at a later date?\n\nI appreciate that you feel remorseful, and have apologized, but your brother also has the right to continue no contact.  Maybe some day that will change, but don't count on it.  I doubt there will be too many more events like this in the future so as much as it sucks to miss this, it won't be common.", "NTA.

That\u2019s bad faith right there, unless you were truly evil to him.", "NTA you are not responsible for his choices or behavior.

Has she ever apologized to your brother for allowing it to happen? Did she ever make you face any real consequences of your actions?

To be honest, when your brother finally put his foot down, she shouldn't have \"split the baby\" - you did something really bad, your brother should never have had to be the one to back out of family events b/c he couldn't be around you i.e. be punished for your actions - at least for the 1st few years. You could have done the work to keep up the family relationships separately from family events and let your brother understand upfront that you recognize that the situation is your fault and you take responsibility. Actions speak louder than words and an apology isn't enough. Your actions over the years communicated both you and your mother felt brother was equally to blame for being bullied.\n\nUnfortunately, all of this is common and the abused person is treated like the issue is fully theirs or it is viewed as the issue is 50/50 between the abuser and the abused by family.

You\u2019re willing to work with the situation to make it so that you\u2019re no where near him, have no contact with him or anything like that means to me I don\u2019t think your an asshole for wanting to attend. He\u2019s also not an asshole for being unable to look past it, he\u2019s traumatised. It\u2019s honestly a rock and a hard place situation that there will be no real winners here. If you go, he won\u2019t and that\u2019ll upset your mum. If you don\u2019t go and he does, your mum will still be upset. If neither of you go then your mum is still upset. If you ask your mum then that\u2019s pretty much asking her to choose between her sons which isn\u2019t fair to her, she clearly wants both of you there. You could take the hit as it\u2019s your fault this situation has even occurred but as I said your mum may still be upset as she still wont have one of her sons there, maybe that\u2019s the best course of action. At least that way, you\u2019ve done literally everything for your brother to be comfortable and to try and keep the peace so it\u2019s then on him if your mums upset that you\u2019re not there. There\u2019s only so much you can do.", "NAH. Could you compromise? One go to the ceremony and the other to the reception?", "NAH. As much as it sucks, I think skipping your mom's wedding, so your brother can go is the right thing to do.

I'd attend as a guest, give my congrats to the couple at the reception (if possible when bro wasn't around) and dip shortly after dinner having been seated away from the bridal party. Leave those options for your brother. If you accidentally bump into him just say some polite salutations and walk away. \n\nFor the extended fam that doesn't know the story, just blame work and other boring obligations for your decreased participation. You're at an age now where that's a sufficiently sympathetic excuse for most.\n\nIf your brother isn't OK with that I'd skip the whole affair and then celebrate dinner with the couple after their honeymoon. Watch the video and look at pictures together afterward.

Having been in a similar spot as your mother, it hurt a lot to have to chose one or the other, and I feel for her a lot, I\u2019m sorry you guys are in this situation. Kids are dumb and will make mistakes especially without guidance. I hope you guys can reach an agreement and I hope your family can heal.", "I applaud you for recognizing that your behavior was traumatic to him, and seeking help.  Also, for knowing that your remorse doesn't obligate his forgiveness.\n\nIf no compromise can truly be reached, then I would suggest you be the one to stay home.

That should be sufficient to say who the asshole is.", "Y T A for the bullying and therefore YWBTA if you attended, if it means your brother cannot. While your Mom clearly wants the two of you, that will not happen under current circumstances. I recommend you stand down in favour of your brother - as an act of atonement towards him, and an acknowledgement that your childhood actions created the current rift. Your Mom is not without fault, having allowed the bullying, so her wish should take second place here as well. Perhaps, in due course and with additional therapy, your brother may come to appreciate your decision on this point as a genuine effort to heal.", "People might change but the damage has been done. For example, if I harm your child but go through years of therapy and work on myself, I can change my behavior. But because of me, your child is still damaged.\n\nGood for OP if he has really changed. The problem is that he can not unfortunately what he did to his brother or how the brother feels. He has to live with that and he should skip the wedding.", "Yep, as someone who has a lot of experience in these fields the first thing I saw was sexual assault. Extremely common among siblings, even more common than parent to child sexual abuse.", "Have to add, he\u2019s allowed to not forgive you though, but it\u2019s on him to heal and decide what to do next. I just think that the bottom line is if your mother wants you both there, you both should be able to put what happened aside for the sake of the love of the mother. Offering an apology, offering to take shifts, and even considering not going for him, those are signs of learning and moving forward.", "I don\u2019t think there is one right decision here. I think you have a couple of options:\n\n1. Assuming the abuse was so traumatic that your brother really cannot be around you, I would suggest staying home for his sake. It could be a gesture of good will on your part, letting him know through your actions that you take responsibility and accept his boundaries.\n2. Go, let him and your mother know that you don\u2019t intend to get in anyone\u2019s way and that you are still working on forgiving yourself and want to be there for your mother, and that you recognize what a ridiculously awful rock and a hard place this is. \n\nGood luck to you.", "OP,  Have you tried to write a letter to your brother with a heartfelt apology?  It may help letting him know you recognize that instead of being the brother he deserved, you chose to be an abuser and you can only imagine the horror he must of felt at your hands.  That you would love nothing more than to try to make up for the past and even if he never wants any contact with you ever again, to just remember that you are there for him if he ever needs you and that you are rooting for him from afar and leave it at that.  Maybe in a few years he will come around or maybe he won't.  All you can do is to be sincere.  Also let him know that you will respect his wishes as far as the wedding goes.", "Is it a large wedding? Maybe you could just go to the ceremony, sit in the back and your brother might not even know you were there", "Agreed. If seeing you will be traumatic for your brother, then stay away. If he has PTSD from your actions, stay away. If seeing you may cause a panic attack, stay away. But if he just won't like seeing you but will otherwise be ok then maybe go. Ultimately,  let your brother decide what he wants to do. Also, how much were your parents aware of the bullying?", "I would assume the therapist is privy to more info than you are aware of. That's usually how therapists usually work lol.\n\nLol why do you find yourself qualified to disparage the therapist? You said they were doing shoddy work due to not having enough info (which you have 0 proof of) and then you proceeded to make a recommendation with very little info.", "If they followed your reasoning, therapists would never be able to help their patients, considering they very rarely have access to other people's perspectives other than their patients', yet are here to help them walk through their problems and find a better footing in life.", "I have to admit that abuse is abuse. And everyone deals with it differently. Is affected by it differently. If going NC has helped OPs brother then that\u2019s probably for the best. It\u2019s obviously painful to see him. Traumatic even. But it seems unfair that they can\u2019t even join the same event. Maybe ask if it\u2019s okay to be at the ceremony together and forego the reception?

My bad, I must have missed that part.\n\nBecause if we aren't, that's a pretty weird example to use since it's its no way comparable to attending a wedding. \n\nBut then again, I could have missed it, so could you point to where we were talking about prison instead of a wedding?", "How can we judge the situation without knowing what happened ? Making a judgement call based on what *the brother's reaction* is seems risky to me.\n\nConsidering how often people here advocate for others to go \"no-contact\" with their family members or friends whenever the family member/friend in question makes a mistake, I'd start betting the brother came on this subreddit a few years ago and applied the advice given here.\n\nI'm joking, but barely.", "Something tells me you don't know how that works.", "The therapist only knows what the client tells them.

She has, however, said that she would like both of you there. If she requests it of your brother, to go to the wedding, you pair avoid each other, but at least having both her children there on her special day, then it comes down to his choice whether he can cope with it for a few hours of one day for his mum, or whether he will upset her by not being there.\n\nYou have been to therapy, you've seen your faults, admitted them... And he has chosen to not forgive you. That then is his choice. There is only so much you can do or say. You can't spend the rest of your life feeling guilt and remorse badly enough to continue beating yourself up over it, and giving way to him over such a major event as your mum's wedding.\n\nIf you want to be there as your mum requested, then go. It's not a case of your importance over his, because your mum asked both of you to be there. Consider what your mum would want. Get her to talk to him. Write a letter stating that you will be going to the wedding, and will happily try to avoid him as much as possible, but this is one thing that you do not want to miss out on. Extend your remorse and apologies again about the past, and say that you hope he will be able to put it aside for one day, for the sake of your mother's wishes. He doesn't need to speak to you while there. A nod of acknowledgement of each other's attendance would be quite sufficient.\n\nThat is all you need to do. Other than turn up, as your mother requested. And if he turns up? Good. Just avoid. Don't try to talk to him or anything. That ball is firmly in his court, and your mum doesn't need any drama on her wedding day between two grown adults.\n\nOne small addition: beware of him using the wedding attendance as a weapon against you: \"I couldn't go to my mum's wedding because of my brother being there\". He could go, and he could ignore you, and he could see his mum get married, and he could have a nice meal, and he could see lots of family and friends, or he could sit at home wishing he had just gone for the sake of your mother, but it would be his choice. Talk to your mother about it. There's a good gap between now and the wedding, so it's not going to be too much added stress right now. Good luck.", "Based on the limited information, I have to advocate for the victim of years of bullying and torment that you admit to.

We arent close - Its my fault - Not sure what you did to your brother but I barely speak to mine. He'll take my phone calls if he needs something but were not close. Again my fault, We could go months without speaking even when we lived in the same house as we were older.\n\nI have expressed remorse and my brother says hes not holding on to that stuff anymore. We recently we went on round trip four car ride together to visit family for Christmas. He took a picture with just me and him at Christmas. Its hanging on my wall- Only pic with us as adults.\n\nHere's what Ive learned from one bully to another.\n\n1). I feel Horrible for the shit I did to him when were kids. I wish I hadn't done it. I would take it all back if I could. I wish I could say I popped out of the womb a compassionate thoughtful human being but I didnt.\n\n2). I am responsible for my behavior and my actions. \n\n3). I am alone bare the consequences of my actions even though I was minor when this all occurred. I am the one that must live with myself. The memories I hold arent going away. They are mine and I am stuck with them for the rest of my life. Forgiven or not.\n\n4). When we are minors OUR PARENTS are supposed to parent us. They are supposed to check our bad behavior. My parents are divorced and they didnt. Its why my behavior was allowed to get as bad as it did. I was abused by my mother's boyfriends and harassed by some of father's girlfriends.\n\n5) NOT AN EXCUSE but an explanation. I took that abuse I experienced and turned it on someone I could pick on. My baby brother. I was ab\\*\\*ch. I wish I could take it back.\n\n6) Now I have to live with it- As do you. I am not sure of your situation. If it resembles mine in anyway, but something tells me your behavior was allowed to reach certain heights due to lack of parenting.\n\n7) From one bully to another, you are allowed to be remorseful and sorry but the regret you feel that\u2019s not going away. Its just apart of you now \u2013 Accept that 1) this is your consequence 2) your consequence is a good thing- some people do sh\\*tty things and feel no regret ever- praise whatever God you have that your not them because that\u2019s worse than the shitty way you feel now. 3) You are allowed to grow from this and not tiptoe around it for the rest of your life. You said you were sorry- He doesn\u2019t want a relationship with you- You are respecting that \u2013 That\u2019s all you can do. You don\u2019t have to stay in the same place for the rest of your life. Go to the wedding. He is an adult now he can decide for himself if he wants to go or not\n\n8) If you ever get into a financially good situation where you have lots of money, offer to pay for your brother\u2019s therapy. If I hit it big,or come into money, I wanna pay off my brother\u2019s student loans. I look at it like I made my brother\u2019s life hard once maybe to help ease his burdens if I get the opportunity - take the time and make his life easier.
