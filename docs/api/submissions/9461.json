It seems needlessly confrontational/aggressive? I don't know anything about therapy though", "NAH - everyone is wounded here. But this isn't trading off every other birthday - this is a one time event. Your brother certainly doesn't need to forgive you to attend and your offer to stay as far away from him is generous. You can be in opposite sides of the room, don't share in any photos, and be there only for your mom.\n\nOne caveat - since we don't know the extent of your bullying (and we don't need the details here), if it was truly heinous and unforgivable, then maybe you should stay home.", "NAH except your mother.

The biggest loser here is your mother, although I imagine that she bears some responsibility for the bullying getting to the extent that you\u2019re now no-contact. \n\nI would ask her what she wants to do. Not as in \u201cpick which one of her children comes to her wedding\u201d, as in would she like to talk to him about both of you going and being completely separated the entire time? To what degree is she willing to make a specific request not to mend a bridge but to figure out what will happen without all of the guessing?", "Maybe you can do shifts or something like you go to ceremony and he goes to reception ? Just a thought. I would say NAH because altho you messed up in the past, you are taking steps to fix the issue and its your brothers choice to be NC or not.", "i feel like this is 99% on the mom. she allowed OP to bully, and now has zero concern for the youngest. To me it makes most sense for him to not go. He stated and confirmed he won't go if OP is there. OP is invited, so that is mom making her pick. \n\nI don't see the brother as the AH since i asume based on OP statement that the bullying was not a few offhand remarks, and he has the right to not want contact. \n\nOP is sorry, said so to brother and is trying to make aments, so while he was the AH in the past, he is not now.", "YTA for the bullying alone, and depending on the type of bullying, that's how much of an AH.\n\nWithout the bullying history this would be an easy choice.\n\nIt's mom's wedding. Mom wants both of you there. You can't both be there if you don't attend, so obviously you attend.\n\nHowever... it's your brother's trauma. He might not be *able* to attend if you're there. \n\nThen again, we don't know the extent of the bullying or how old you were as kids when it happened and if he's \"punishing\" you for normal sibling stupidity.\n\nThe fact that's it is almost always pretty serious when people go NC, leads me to think it's the former, and you should stay home.\n\nYour therapist telling you to \"stand your ground\" makes me think it might be the latter. In which case you should go.\n\nBut mostly I'm thinking this shouldn't be your decision at all.\n\nYour mother needs to accept that both of you *will not* be in the same room. So she's going to need to decide what to do about that. Whether it's taking shifts or telling one of you to stay home.\n\nIt's her choice.\n\nBut that's a hard choice to make between your children, especially for a wedding.\n\nPersonally, for me, making that choice would be harder than not having either of you there.\n\nSo really, you have the opportunity to either spare your mother from making that choice or not.\n\nAnd since you are stating unequivocally that you're the one at fault... I'd say you're the one who needs to miss out.\n\nBut again, we don't know what the bullying was?! So?! but yeah, pretty sure YTA here... \n\nopen to a changing of the mind, though.", "In this specific situation you're NTA. Unlike most of Reddit, I believe people can change.

At this point, there's really nothing else you can do. \n\nIf he wants to skip his mom's wedding because he is unable to be in the same space as you, then so be it. \n\nI will say this though - DO NOT MAKE YOUR MOTHER CHOOSE BETWEEN HER CHILDREN.", "NAH. Sometimes this sub is so full of itself. Mom wants both of them, therapist thinks it's ok. Maybe they know more than 3 paragraphs of context.\n\nIMO, it's totally understandable that your brother isn't over the shit you put him through, he might never be and that's ok. It also sounds like you're trying to make amends as best you can. All that said, I do think that if you can't work out some sort of shifts thing (maybe one attends ceremony and one attends reception) the best move would be to let him go and stay home. You are ultimately the one that created the situation originally, and if you're lucky it might be a step towards building back some good will.", "YTA.\n\nYour actions have consequences. It does not matter that you want to make amends. He doesn't. You bullied him for an extensive amount of time. You knew what you were doing, and yet you didn't stop. It took you leaving for college for him to have any sort of respite from your harassment. \n\nWhile it's great that you're attending therapy and working towards being a better person, that doesn't change what you did to him. \n\nYou're going to have to let your mom be the one who decides. Honestly, the fact that she allowed you to treat your brother the way you did does not bode well with me. Did she not once try to intervene on his behalf?", "WNBTA\n\nObviously, you made some mistakes & you are owning responsibility for those mistakes. Your brother will need to decide for himself how he chooses to move forward. Maybe he never forgives you, that\u2019s his choice, but he can\u2019t control the fact that you share a mother. Her wedding day is not about you & your brother\u2019s issues. You should both do your best to make it special for your Mom.", "YTA if you go and cause him to not attend.\n\nYou hit the nail on the head with your final sentence: If you choose to go, you're putting yourself above him. If he wants to bury the hatchet for the singular event, then of course that's for the best. But if he can't - and unfortunately for you, he's totally within his rights to not want to do so - then you should respect that and find another way to honor your mom. Actions have consequences, and this is one of the consequences of bullying someone.\n\nYou're not owed forgiveness, and to your credit you don't seem to believe you are. If your brother ever chooses to try to mend your relationship, you will have to allow him to dictate the terms of that. And right now, the terms of your relationship are that you don't share spaces.\n\nFor now, all you can do is support your brother in whatever choice he makes re: your mom's wedding. If he has any desire to go - and it sounds like he does - communicate to him that you will not be there.", "YTA\n\nActions have consequences, long term.\n\nTalk to your mother about this.  Let HER decide how to proceed.\n\nShe should be the one to talk with your brother and see if he can tolerate being at the same event with you.  If he can't, let her make the call about which of you attend.\n\nGood Luck", "If you go knowing he won't, I just see it as more bullying.", "NAH, you are doing your part in understanding the harm you caused, he has all the right not to accept your apology \n\nbut since this is a rare event, not a run-of-the-mill birthday party, could you suggest one of you to attend the ceremony and the other the reception?\n\nedit: grammar", "NTA discuss this with your mother.

Just because you were an AH previously doesn\u2019t mean you have to make allowances for your brother all the time.  Your mother wants you both there.  He can avoid you but him not showing up would be his decision.  If you don\u2019t show up your mom still doesn\u2019t get what she wants.\n\nIf you do send the message though you would be the AH.", "I think you would be YTA if you went, even though it sounds like you're trying, you did the things that made him go NC and this is the type of thing you have to live with for now. See your mom and her partner some other time.", "Sadly, YWTA if you attended your mother's wedding. But -\nit seems as if you were deeply remorseful, you went to therapy, own what you did to your brother and tried to make amends. I think you know that you're not entitled to your brother's forgiveness, and you seem to respect that. That's why I think not attending your mother's wedding so that your brother can go would be a wonderful way to show him you care for him, that his happiness is important for you and in that case more important than your own happiness.", "NAH. Well, specifically in this case, not your past, but you are already aware of that.\n\nYour mom has invited you both. She's the important one at her wedding (along with the groom, obviously). If she asked you not to attend, then you should respect that - but she has not done that, so you're in the clear on that end. You are also willing to do you part to minimize impact on him, which seems appropriate from the way you describe this situation. As long as you wouldn't force any unwanted interaction, I'd say you're ok in attending.\n\nOne possible option, if you can get messages between you and your brother: Can you each attend half? Or perhaps both attend the ceremony, then one of you bow out after congratulating the couple (it would probably be you who bows out early, from what I'm seeing).\n\nUltimately the decision is his, and his alone. You still exist and have a right to be there", "yes you would be, altho yes your mom wants both of you there, in these cases it is best to defer to the victim not the perpertrator of the abuse, think of it as concequences for you being  such a bully", "I'm leaning towards NTA.\n\nYes, you were an asshole in the past, but that doesn't mean you're one in this specific situation.\n\nIt seems you're willing to compromise here, while your brother isn't. That's his right to choose. But it doesn't sound like you would even interact with him. So it kinda seems like he's putting his want to not be in the same room as you over being there at his mother's wedding. Which I kinda think is an asshole thing to do.\n\nWhen there's a situation like this, I tend to side with the person who's willing to make a compromise over the one who isn't.", "That's a tough one.  Can your mom have someone have you on video chat so you can watch instead of attend then take her, and her partner out to dinner at a later date?\n\nI appreciate that you feel remorseful, and have apologized, but your brother also has the right to continue no contact.  Maybe some day that will change, but don't count on it.  I doubt there will be too many more events like this in the future so as much as it sucks to miss this, it won't be common.", "NTA.

That\u2019s bad faith right there, unless you were truly evil to him.", "NTA you are not responsible for his choices or behavior.

Has she ever apologized to your brother for allowing it to happen? Did she ever make you face any real consequences of your actions?

Has she downplayed the abuse to your brother \"it wasn't that bad\" \"it was a long time ago, you should be over it by now\" \"but he is your brother and you have to forgive him sometime\" or \"it would make me so happy to see you both there\" or \"he is my son too, blah, blah, blah\".\n\nSometimes, in these situations, the people who try to \"repair\" the damage do more harm than good and push the abused person farther away from healing by constantly letting them know it is the victim's issue for not being over it yet. To be honest, when your brother finally put his foot down, she shouldn't have \"split the baby\" - you did something really bad, your brother should never have had to be the one to back out of family events b/c he couldn't be around you i.e. be punished for your actions - at least for the 1st few years. You could have done the work to keep up the family relationships separately from family events and let your brother understand upfront that you recognize that the situation is your fault and you take responsibility. Actions speak louder than words and an apology isn't enough. Your actions over the years communicated both you and your mother felt brother was equally to blame for being bullied.\n\nUnfortunately, all of this is common and the abused person is treated like the issue is fully theirs or it is viewed as the issue is 50/50 between the abuser and the abused by family. It goes a long way, tword healing to see consequences for the abuser, but that really didn't happen here.
