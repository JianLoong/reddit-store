I have been doing this since 2019, and I know pretty much everyone. It's just a day trip and it's all nice and fun.\n\nI usually work on one boat, but sometimes I change. In the past, I've met two men, Steve and George. We are really good friends. Steve used to work on my boat as a barman, and he's such an amazing human being. George is making kick ass cocktails. We were making an amazing team, and we had so much fun together. \n\nThis year, Steve and George no longer work there. And we got really terrible crew. They're lazy and don't want to do anything at all. Toilets are dirty, lack of toilet paper etc. I don't really like them, but I'm nice to them.\n\nThe bartender is a woman, Emma. She's the daughter of the captain. She is super annoying person. She would call me over to her for most mundane things. She wants to talk or to tell me to tell someone she needs something. I'm the guide so it's not my job. I told her many times that she can't do that as i have my own work to do.\n\nThe other day after long afternoon I said out loud \"I miss Steve and George.\" And she started shouting \"go to them then.\" I said that they're my friends. And she started long talk about how she is also good and what I said it's hurtful. I simply said that she's not my friend because I've met her two weeks ago and I know them for many years now. \n\nIt didn't work. She told everyone that I'm the asshole because I was mean to her and told her she's not good. I didn't tell her the last bit. \n\nSo AITA?\n\nEdit:\n\nThe boat belongs to the company, not the captain. I do not know the job on the boat. I am the guide. I talk to the people and tell them information. That's it. Emma just wanted someone to gossip with, and she was taking me away from my duties.", "created_utc": 1686819726, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/149xeoq/aita_for_telling_work_colleague_that_shes_not_my/", "score": 36, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Further, she keeps trying to take you away from doing your job simply to waste your time.", "Nta at all but I would probably apologize and make nice ONLY bc she is the captains daughter. Job security, ya know?", "NTA\n\nYou told her several times she's asking you to do her job or asking you things that aren't in your job description.\n\nSo maybe you could have been a little more tactfull, BUT a colleague is *NOT* automatically a friend!\n\nIf your desciption of her is accurate, she kinda sounds like she's used to getting her way and people fawning over her and she's upset you aren't.", "NTA", "YTA\n\nShe's a new hire and it sounds like she was trying to learn the ropes from you, the experienced employee. You decided to be an AH to her, publicly draw attention to how much you preferred your old colleagues, then told her unnecessarily that you're not friends when it seems she was just looking to have a friendly working relationship.", "YTA\n\nYou passive aggressively picked a fight with her.\n\nBad career choice given her connection to the Captain.\n\nAre there other boats that you can work on? Do you really want to stay on that one with her for the upcoming summer?", "YTA and kindergartens calling, for both of you. She actually wishes to be friends with you that\u2019s the reason she\u2019s calling you over a lot while working. And you don\u2019t have to rub it into their faces you don\u2019t like them as much as your old crew. Ofc you don\u2019t have to call any of the new crew members your friends, but you don\u2019t have to show them how much you dislike them since you still gotta work with them somehow and it\u2019s affecting the work climate in a bad way I guess.", "YTA. \n\nWhether it\u2019s true or not, kind of an AH move to go to a new employee, huff & puff, and talk about how much you miss their predecessors. Also didn\u2019t appear like she was implying you two were buddy-buddy, so also kind of an AH move to throw out \u201cwe\u2019re not friends\u201d unprovoked. Again, true or not. Just seems unnecessary.", "YTA, at some point, you've got to think is it really worth the hassle in getting in petty arguments. Sounds like a proper high school musical situation. \n\nYou already don't like working with these people, so having outbursts like that is probably only going to make it worse and make you unhappiesr than you sound at the minute. \n\nWhilst it's not ideal, it's probably worth staying civil for your own sanity as well as having some professionalism in the workplace.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My boss from tour company is.", "She wanted to gossip with me. I have no idea about the work on the boat. I come, I talk to people I tell them about history and stuff. I don't work on the boat per se. There are 4 other workers who should teach her, and she only works in the bar, not doing everything.", "The thing is that the boat doesn't belong to the captain. I work for a company that owns it. I am bound by contract, and it's not worth leaving now when all good jobs are taken.", "I actually don't show them that I don't like them. I am nice. Even when they're taking me away from my own work, I am always nice. This was the only time that I actually said something. I was super frustrated because imagine being taken away from your work to do the work of others.", "\"If it's true\"? It is true.\n\nThe only thing I said was \"ugh I miss Steve and George.\" She took it too personally. I never said anything bad about her.", "How is your relationship with your boss? He is the person who is ultimately going to be affected when passengers have a bad experience. He is the one who is going to have to deal with bad reviews and loss of revenue.", "I only know a little bit about boats from what I learned Growing Up in Southern California near the beach cities. Newport, Huntington, places like that.\n\nDoesn't the captain kind of more or less run things day to day? Set the agenda for the crew. They are essentially the senior most person aboard the boat? \n\nIt seems like the captain got his daughter a job. She isn't very good at it and is still learning. That's unfortunate. Apparently the rest of the crew isn't very good either, given what you said about the toilets and other things.\n\nDon't you have Team meetings or anything where you can bring up some of the things that are not getting done?\n\nWorking in the service industry sucks sometimes. Having a good team makes all the difference. Having a bad team can make life a living hell sometimes.\n\nI feel for you. It seems like you're caught between a rock and a hard place. I hope that things start running more smoothly once people have been in their positions for a while longer.\n\nEdit : I think you're one common interest is money. You all want the passengers to have a good experience so that they leave big tips. You can point out that they're not likely to leave tips if they have to deal with dirty bathrooms, lack of toilet paper, whatever else is going on. Find a common ground with everyone. Point out how it is in their best interest to take care of things.", "Doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s true, that\u2019s the point. It\u2019s pretty rude to unnecessarily point out to coworkers \u201chey, btw, we\u2019re not friends\u201d when it didn\u2019t sound like she was assuming you were.", "I have a very good relationship with my boss. And I honestly never complain. It has to be something huge for me to say something.", "Unfortunately, this is more complicated. The actual owner of the boat trusted the captain and the captain as the boss is bad. He never tells anyone to do something. It's a real mayhem on the boat. Last year wasn't like that. Now the crew is super bad.", "This entire situation sounds huge enough to say something. At best, you'll have disgruntled customers because they've paid money to be on a filthy boat. At worst, it's more than the toilets they're neglecting and it's a prime time news accident waiting to happen.", "That sounds like a liability lawsuit waiting to happen. NTA but I'd seriously consider if you want to keep this job or if it's time to find another one.", "The boss knows. But they only work when the boss is on the boat and he can't go every day.", "Sounds like your boss needs some leadership training then. If the boss can only get results when they're physically in sight, something is fundamentally broken with the way they're managing things. \n\nI work in HR. I see these situations a lot and it's always the high-performers that get fed up and quit first before poor management realizes that maybe the situation needs to be permanently addressed. It's maddening every time I see it because it's always predictable.", "Yeah I'm here since 2019 and I think that after this season I will leave. I am good at my job. I know that. But I can't have this bs all the time"]}
