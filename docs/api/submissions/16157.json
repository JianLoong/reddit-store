She\u2019s your wife. If it wasn\u2019t a \u201cserious competition\u201d why wouldn\u2019t you vote for her?\n\nI can see why her feelings were hurt. Not even her husband voted for her and everyone saw that. Must have been pretty embarrassing for her. Where\u2019s your loyalty?\n\nETA: Just saw your edit, OP...\n>She said the night before that she was tired and didn\u2019t want to get ready for it or to go, we only went and participated because I really want to be friends with the neighbors, she wasn\u2019t like invested in it.\n\nSo she, out of loyalty to you, went in spite of the fact that she was tired and didn't want to go?.\n\n>She didn\u2019t vote for me in every category either. And she also got mad and told me \u201cit\u2019s fine I knew you wouldn\u2019t vote for me anyways.\u201d\n\nBut she did vote for you in some categories whereas you didn't vote for her at all leaving her \"entry\" hanging out there in the wind with zero votes. Nice.\n\nDude, you basically told the entire neighborhood (that was in attendance) that you don't like your wife's cooking.", "Geez. \n\nI'm going with soft YTA - you *know* this is something your wife has emotional investment in and cares about, why wouldn't you vote for her stuff, regardless of whether the host is *actually* the better baker? \n\nObviously, you don't *have* to do that, but when you vote against your own partner in a social thing in front of other people, it's very, very predictable that her feelings are going to be hurt. This was literally a \"no stakes\" case where you could have supported her passion and you chose not to. \n\n\"This thing that you care about and think of yourself as super good at, you're just not as good as this other person\" might be true, but it's not something you're necessarily looking to hear from your husband at a no-stakes social event. She was already going to be a little disappointed to lose, but to know that not even her husband voted for her is absolutely going to sting.", "Wait...\"nobody voted for her at all\"...so she didn't even vote for herself?", "YTA. \n\nShe did not want to go. She still baked. All because you wanted to be friends with the neighbors. Then, you had the audacity to not vote for her. If I were a betting man, I would wager even if your wife's was better, you would vote for the neighbor to win their approval. \n\nYour comments make it worse. Your wife was doing this for you and felt unsupported by you when she is trying to make you happy. That makes you an AH to your wife.", "YTA. Aw, come on, man. You didn\u2019t vote for your wife? SMH. That\u2019s cold. Ice cold. Sure, the contest seemed trivial to you, but it mattered to her, and she likes baking, whether she\u2019s good at it or not. Now she\u2019s going to be the lady whose husband wouldn\u2019t vote for her. I feel sorry for the lady, NGL.", "I remain in awe of how far underground men have lowered the bar. \n\nYTA", "Dude, you could've had an easy home run with your wife on this one, but you totally whiffed it, lol. Low stakes? Vote for your wife. High stakes? Vote for whoever you want. Not that hard. YTA.", "YTA.  I feel so sorry for her.  It literally would have cost you nothing to be kind.", "YTA. You forced her to go when she didn't want to in the first place, then when instead of voting for herself, she mostly voted for you to hype you up, and you couldn't even show her the same courtesy once? Your attitude towards your wife is horrendous, and you aren't being supportive in the slightest.\n\nEdit: spelling", "whaat \n\nHYPE UP YOUR FUCKIN QUEEN!!! \n\nYou could have at least voted for her once ffs \n\nYTA", "YTA and your comments make you look worse, true colors are showing dude. I\u2019m so confused reading this honestly because I always hype my partner up for the extra things they do. I also grew up in a home where that was happening too. If my mom brought food for a party then my dad was eating most of it and raving about it to anyone who would listen. It\u2019s just about being excited that your person is doing things I guess. \n\nI think what actually made me sad about this was that she said she knew you wouldn\u2019t vote for her. That\u2019s heartbreaking and I hope you will stop minimizing that. I know it\u2019s sucks to have people calling you out but sometimes it\u2019s good to listen.", "YTA - if the competition was low stakes and didn\u2019t matter, it makes even less sense why you wouldn\u2019t support your wife with a vote. It\u2019s not like you had to protect your integrity by voting for the best because money and/or some high stakes prize was in question.", "YTA. I\u2019d be pissed at you too. She may not have voted for you every time but she did at least vote for you. If she is being paid for her baking, then she\u2019s clearly better than you are. At least there are some people who value her skills. You clearly don\u2019t.", "YTA", "YTA", "Your edit makes you a huge AH, imo. Your wife didn\u2019t even want to go to this and you made her because you want to be friends with the neighbours. \n\nYou downplay her baking ability and when she\u2019s communicative with you about why her feelings are hurt you brush them aside because you \u201cjust voted for what you thought was best.\u201d Aka you rubbed salt in her wounds and reiterated you didn\u2019t think any of hers were best. \n\nEspecially at an event she\u2019s going to FOR YOU, it wouldn\u2019t have killed you to be kind and hype your wife up a few times especially when you can see she\u2019s getting no votes at all. What a shitty way to spend a night at an event you don\u2019t even want to be at. \n\nThen you double down in comments about how you aren\u2019t responsible for her feelings, \u201cbut men\u2019s mental health!!!\u201d, and claim to hype her up in other ways you can\u2019t seem to specify. You got told you\u2019re the asshole and she was right and you\u2019re making it easier and easier to cast that judgement. Do better. \n\nYTA.", "Soft YTA always hype your girl up, so basic", "YTA.  Yeah you can vote for whoever you want, but I would definitely feel unsupported if I were your wife.  What really gets the AH vote though is that it sounds like when she was expressing to you how hurt she felt you just brushed off her feelings and explained why you made the choice.  She wasn't asking you why you did it, she was being vulnerable.  At the end of the day it doesn't matter if you deliberately did something to hurt her, your actions were still hurtful to her.", "YTA how hard is it to throw one vote to your wife, is she not the most important person in the world to you?", "YTA : Be in your wife's corner", "YTA\n\nI could serve my husband dog food and he would still tell me it's the nicest food he's ever had \ud83d\ude02", "YTA. You don't vote for \"what you thought was the best\" when your partner is in competition. You vote for them.", "Are you an asshole for not supporting your wife? Yes. Yes you are. \n\nAnd if the roles were reversed, you would be upset for the same reasons.", "INFO: Based on your comments, I have to ask, do you even like your wife?", "YTA: if this was my neighborhood, I could have not brought anything and my Bf would\u2019ve have stilly hyped up my baking.", "YTA\n\nFrom your comments it seems like you don't even like your wife. You make her out to be some hen pecking shrew and you're the poor guy who can't seem to do anything right.\n\nIf you don't care she's upset and can't fathom why, or still feel the need to paint yourself as the hurt one in this situation maybe it's time to reconsider why you're in this relationship.", "Yta through the good and bad. That\u2019s low key embarrassing you didn\u2019t vote for her and then her comment at the end that she knew you wouldn\u2019t vote for seems like you have done things like this similar in the past.", "YTA. Your comments make it worse. Ugh.", "YTA, you could have voted for her in at least one of the categories", "YTA. My husband will not even think about voting for anyone else if I am in a competition, game, etc. What is the point of being together if you will not support each other? I would have been super angry if you were my husband and probably leave home to stay with a friend.", "So YOU really want to be friends with the neighbors.. is that why you voted for them over your wife? What do you think the neighbours think of you now anyway?  YTA", "YTA  you never not voted for your wife when they will find out about it you vote for your wife", "I gotta lean with YTA. Since it's just a game and the stakes are low then just be nice to your wife and vote for her on at least one or two items.", "Bro hype up your wife wth\n\nYTA", "YTA. She was tired the night before and didn\u2019t want to go. The only reason that she went is because you wanted to make friends. This event was also a lot of work for someone who doesn\u2019t want to be there in the first place. \n\nHonestly, assuming this is a real post, I don\u2019t for two minutes believe that you like your wife\u2019s baking, and you are thus dismissive of her work. She\u2019s an expert enough baker to have been paid for customized cakes. That\u2019s well beyond an average home baker. This other woman may or may not be more professional (is she a full-time professional baker? Why is she more professional than your wife), but your wife\u2019s baking abilities clearly exceed the average person on the street. \n\nIt seems like you took the opportunity to knock your wife down a peg by just claiming that the other options were better (which of course reinforced your larger goals of making friends with your neighbors\u2014Supporting your wife wouldn\u2019t have gotten you the immediate social points that praising someone else\u2019s work would) and then downplaying your actions by going \u201cIt\u2019s just for fun!\u201d\n\nBaking is clearly more than just a fun activity for your wife. She was already making a sacrifice by attending. The least you could have done was pick her once so that she wasn\u2019t just fully thrown under the bus.\n\nAnd I\u2019m telling you now: The immediate social benefit of picking and praising others\u2019 baking is going to wear off quickly. Not picking your wife\u2019s baking was absolutely noticed and the neighbors are going to have your household pegged as the one with marital problems\u2014After all, what loving husband wouldn\u2019t have supported his wife at all, especially when she backed him up?", "YTA", "YTA\n\nBro vote for your wife. It sounds like she is unhappy in your marriage, treat your wife feel like a queen.", "YTA\n\nALWAYS!! vote for your wife.", "Bigger YTA coz now u don't want to accept that you are TA and should have voted for her. And obviously now u know that baking games are important to her, no matter what u think so be mindful in future!", "So she didn't vote for you in every category, but she did in some of them.  When she didn't get any votes in the first 3 categories, making it obvious that even you hadn't voted for her, why didn't you vote for her in at least one or two of the others, just so she could save face a little?  Especially if \"the stakes were incredibly low\"...?", "Yta- she is your wife. Her cooking should always be the best to you.", "YTA. \n\nSocial or not, if she takes pride in it, so do you.", "I guess YTA.  You yourself said it was low stakes so you could have tossed her a bone.  The whole situation just made my laugh honestly", "That \u201cI knew you wouldn\u2019t vote for me anyway\u201d is making me so sad. This really bummed me out", "YTA. Come on man, have your wife's back. My wife is a terrible baker and I would vote for her with a mouthful of burnt-ass cookies and a smile on my face. You're not beholden to some higher authority of honesty in baking lol. It was such a small thing to do that you knew would make your wife happy.", "YTA it's obvious that you are never in HER corner. My husband always hypes me up even after 30 years? JFC do you even want to be married to this women.\nI sincerely hope she decides that being with you isn't worth it anymore.", "This has to be fake. Please be fake.", "Clear YTA, especially with the comments. You have a victim complex. It would have cost you nothing to be kind and vote for her. You know she prides herself on her baking. You know she\u2019s insecure. Why not do this one tiny thing to make her happy? And then when you get called on it, you start saying \u201ceverything I do is wrong!\u201d Maybe because you\u2019re an asshole.", "NAH - your wife is allowed to be upset that she got no votes, but you didnt have to specifically vote for her.", "NAH here. But her feelings got hurt. \n\nIf you had been paying attention perhaps you would have noticed that no one was voting for her dishes and you could have thrown a pitty vote her way. You obviously weren't. That doesn't make you an AH imho. But it's a learning opportunity. Next time you'll pay attention.\n\nMaybe this is precisely the reason she didn't want to participate. Some people are very insecure and feel badly easily in these situations.\n\nTalk things through. Seems like your wife has some unresolved feelings about you being supportive\n\nEdit to add: *UGH your comments aren't helping your case.*", "YTA- You should of voted for one of her cookies atleast.", "That may not make you an asshole but it may make u have to jerk it for a few months\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "INFO: So you want to be friends with these neighbors.

No one voted for her so she might not be as good as she think she is.", "Edit: Changing my judgement from ESH to YTA\n\nIt's not totally unimaginable that she's hurt and rightfully so, while she expected support regardless of who you thought was actually better she did support you by voting for you. \n\nEven though it may have not seemed like a big deal for you, it might have been for her once she actually got to the event.", "ESH. You should have either agreed to vote for each other, or agreed to only vote for other people.\n\nAt my company, any of our corporate \"competitions\", I NEVER vote for myself, even if I truly believe I have the best costume, best cubicle decoration, etc. It just feels icky. Now if ONLY your wife was competing, then I'd say you should back her regardless. But considering you were both in it, ( and she also didn't vote for you in all regards ) I feel like you were fine not voting for her.\n\nI wouldn't want the pity vote, personally.", "NTA.   I love to cook and bake, and would expect my husband to choose the cookie he liked best, not pick mine just because he\u2019s married to me.   It\u2019s a baking competition, not a popularity contest.   People are supposed to choose the cookie that tastes best!", "NTA because I know if my husband and I were in this situation, he wouldn't give me a pity vote. This approach has led me to push the boundaries of my skills and even though your wife is hurt now, it may end up motivating her to be better for the future. She's also NTA for being hurt either.", "NTA", "NTA !!! As a fabulous baker, I know my husband would vote for me. But if my neighbor was a better baker than me, I would expect him to vote for her. It is a CONTEST. If she wants a participation trophy she should go back to grade school.", "Lol. NTA.\n\nYou gave an honest opinion. I\u2019m enjoying all the clown shoes posts though about how you should just lie, and vote for your wife instead.", "NTA\n\nWhat is the point in a competition if you don't wont for the one who is best? As a human being I totally understand her feelings though. It would suck so much to realize that I was not as good as I thought, but would she have felt better if the votes she got were pity votes from her husband? I think she would have felt equally as shitty, but now she could find a reason to turn that bad feeling towards you.", "NTA. \n\nThe couples that always team up and can't play games or do little competitions alone are the worst. I have a friend whose wife was like that. It made any group events terrible, and even he never had fun. They only got invites to strictly social stuff after a while, and even that stopped when she got mad about not getting to join game nights.", "NAH. I think it's reasonable to expect your life partner to support your efforts and be respectful of them and reasonable to be hurt that your dish didn't get any votes.\n\nLikewise it's reasonable to vote for what you liked best, but I wouldn't expect a Husband of the Year nomination this year..", "NTA big time. If you voted for what you legitimately thought was the best cookie. Your wife sounds immature tbh.", "You are massive TA\nYou said it was silly and no stakes. \nDude, life is literally an insane swatch of wtf until you die, if she can find joy and fun in something you consider to be low stakes you should be overjoyed that she was able to. Instead you squashed it because you think its silly.\nYou suck man", "ESH because you're supposed to vote for each other in these things...", "Lol YTA. Even if she put salt instead of sugar, you root for your home team.", "YTA. The only reason you would not vote for her is if she was genuinely terrible at baking. I highly doubt that is the case here. If she is a somewhat competent baker, you have to vote for her.", "Bro support your wife\ud83d\ude2d", "I\u2019m going to say NTA. I would want my husband to vote for what he enjoyed the most and then I would go find who made it and ask for advice.", "YTA esp since you don't even consider it a serious competition but yet you had to turn on your partner for it? Youre just a dick.", "NTA. She shouldn\u2019t enter a competition and expect pity votes.", "NTA her entry wasn\u2019t the best and the rules were \u2018vote for the best\u2019. \n\nIf you aren\u2019t prepared to lose then don\u2019t play the game. No matter how good you think you are at something, at some point someone will almost always be better than you.\n\nBesides nobody said her baking was bad, just that someone else was better.", "NTA. Yeah, you could've given her one pity vote, just because. But you were voting correctly.  She's hurt but shouldn't blame you for your choices. Apparently, others weren't impressed more by her baked goods, either.  It was only compared to the other contestants, who might bake a lot and chose baked goods that they make and others rave about.", "NTA, but I would have told her you didn't vote for her cause you wanted to look impartial or something. But you are clearly an honest man and I can't blame you for that", "It's like the episode of Golden Girls, when everyone bored for Dorothy to move out. Haha NTA", "Maybe against the grain, but I\u2019m going to go with NAH, and that\u2019s due to your edit. Your wife wasn\u2019t invested, you were also a participating baker and she also did not vote for you. While she can be hurt as she considers herself a baker, she didn\u2019t throw a fit or make a scene in private or public and doesn\u2019t seem to be expressing anger towards you. I am also assuming you didn\u2019t rub her nose in it or anything.

Inquire why she feels like you are unsupportive and go from there. \n\nObviously, you know your wife, so I'm sure you are already seeing signs of the insecurities in other ways. Maybe this is your segway into a discussion about it, about speaking to her Dr, etc.", "I think everyone should have autonomy, even when it comes to cookies. You voted for what you liked.

He *knew* we\u2019d all take her side because we always make him the bad guy. Everyone is against him, and he\u2019s the real victim here, who\u2019s just trying to  stand up for himself. Besides his wife obviously thinks way too highly of her baking skills just bc someone was dumb enough to pay her for it sometimes. She needed to be taken down a peg or two!! /s", "No. There were four categories. We each voted for the best one.", "Op YTA. \n\nCould not agree more with this. \n\n>To me that says she's used to you not being in her corner emotionally", "Right. Off the post alone I was thinking maybe a very ignorant/unintentional YTA if there was no malice. But each reply is worse and worse.", "Of course it does.", "It's also according to OP just a \"silly\" night.  So why'd he take the voting so serious. He's a jerk", "OP is absolutely more of an AH in this situation. Increasingly so...considering that reading more into the comments he doesn't at all seem to be coming to terms with what is being said.", "but she did: OP said \"She didn\u2019t vote for me in *every* category either...\" that implies she voted for him in some categories. He could've returned the favor at least once.", "She did. She just didn\u2019t vote for him every time. He didn\u2019t vote for her at all.", "I don't think that's relevant in this discussion - take this elsewhere.", "Then she should have voted for him, she's holding double standards", "That's really the problem. It's not like this incident needs to be the end of the relationship, lol! It could be just one incident if he cared to listen to his wife's feelings. :/", "Holy shit all of this right here OP!", "I can\u2019t control how she feels all the time.", "You and me both.", "\"Clueless!! Party of one!\"", "Yeah, that's... not a supportive attitude, man. That's 100% the AH move. You're not worried about her feelings, you're already worried about defending yourself and invalidating her feelings. That's not good partner behavior. \n\nAnd you *didn't* stand up for her. You voted against her. How is that standing up for her? You did literally the opposite of stand up for her. \n\nIf someone tells you that they don't feel supportive, the response shouldn't be \"how do I defend myself,\" it should be \"what could I do to be more supportive and to help you feel supported?\" \n\nDo you actually like your partner or is this just a \"we're waiting for the inevitable divorce\" situation?", "This attitude, that your wife is wrong about how she feels and you need to approach her feelings with defensiveness, is why YTA", "Question: do you even LIKE your wife? \n\nYTA regardless but wow.", "So she will communicate with you when she is upset (as she should), and you have already decided to respond defensively and tell her that her feelings are incorrect. Yikes. Have you considered actually listening to your wife when she tells you how she would like to be supported? Some day she may stop telling you when she\u2019s upset, that\u2019s when you will have lost her.", "'Don't worry, my nag of a wife will annoy me by telling me what her problem is this time, and I, like I always do, will deflect and act like it's all in her her. Cause that's what supporting partners do, right? I can't possibly be the asshole here!'\n\nI would pay money to see the moment when your wife has enough of your shit and decides tjaty being an ex suits her better.", "Why are you married to someone you obviously hate?", "Just how were you standing up for her??", "Why do you have to defend yourself? She's telling you how she feels and you're telling her her feelings are wrong. You're not listening to her when she's telling you what she needs, much less even thinking about meeting her part way. That's gonna end up ending the relationship.", "Don\u2019t worry. She will eventually stop telling you when you have hurt her. She will eventually stop telling you the good things that happen to her. Don\u2019t worry. She will eventually stop talking to you. Then you don\u2019t have to worry about showing her any kind of support. But eventually, someone else will.", "It sounds like you don\u2019t really care that you were the unsupportive asshole here, so I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re asking.", "Dude. I was E S H until I started reading your comments that pushed it into a YTA. I assume you expected everyone to tell you your wife was being unreasonable and now you're getting snarly about it. Not a good look.\n\nIf your wife tells you she knew you wouldn't vote for her, it's not her looking for a reason to be mad at you. It's her telling you that she knows you don't have her back. That's a huge issue. To then make it sound like you're some put upon husband whose wife will tell you how you're wrong and poor you has to defend himself honestly makes you sound whiny and pathetic.\n\nListen to what people here are telling you, apologize to your wife and do better next time. It's not hard to show your wife you care, you appreciate her baking and you think the world of her. Even knowing you wouldn't vote for her, she still picked you. That says something.", "The way he said \u201cSHE considers herself to be an expert baker\u201d \ud83d\ude22 Poor woman.", "And she lost.\n\nIt's fine to be disappointed with losing,  but I,  personally,  would hate to get a vote just because someone was on my side as opposed to winning.  \n\nNTA.", "You do understand that if she got no votes at all then everyone knows her own husband didn\u2019t vote for her?  You can\u2019t empathize with her feeling sad (and probably a little embarrassed)?", "keep telling yourself that chief....", "She did: \n\n>She didn\u2019t vote for me in every category either. And she also got mad and told me \u201cit\u2019s fine I knew you wouldn\u2019t vote for me anyways.\u201d\n\nThis implies that she did vote for him in at least one category.", "Every comment you make, makes you look so much worse lol", "You can't control how she feels at all. You *can* control your own actions and behaviors. If she doesn't feel hyped up by you, then you could be asking her what she needs/wants, because whatever you've been doing doesn't seem to be working. \n\nYou telling her that you do hype her up and support her isn't going to make her feel hyped up and supported.", "You deserve to be alone. What a terrible response.", "Do you even try to make her feel good about things or are u just this much of an ass always?", "How is this clueless?", "I love how OP is not listening or hearing anything that is being explained to him.  He's very much taking a victimized stance of the poor guy that can't do anything right, she is just going to come at me and criticize me anyway. \n\nOP, commenters have given you very wise and useful advice that your wife is trying to communicate that she does not feel supported. You just want to volley it all back as if you're the fun loving hero of the neighborhood. What exactly is your agenda?", "I was wondering the same thing honestly. \n\nYTA", "That's fair. I still think OP is NTA, sometimes you loose in life, you're not always going to win or get a participation award, wife should take this as a lesson and learn how to improve so she will get votes next time.", "Dude. Your wife doesn't feel supported by you, and based on some of the stuff you've said, it's a bigger problem than just this. Why are you on Reddit trying to find excuses to invalidate her even more instead of apologizing and trying to fix it?", "Because your WIFE simply wants you to support her. Ya'know... like any relationship.. like seriously?? Not ONE vote? As others stated, nice way of showing the community there that you don't support your wife's cooking.. and whatever else for that matter.", "OP is the reason why shows like \u201cKevin Can F*ck Himself\u201d exist, to counter those \u201clovable\u201d goofs like King of Queens and want not. Jesus H Christ.", "Oh my, I loved that show. Completely forgot about it, deserves a rewatch.", "That show speaks to my fucking soul\u2026"]}
