There's usually nothing for me to eat and too high a risk of cross-contamination. The only people that have ever given me shit about it are assholes themselves, so if anyone gives you crap, they're jerks. Being vegan and compromising by eating vegetarian when you're out is very reasonable. You did nothing wrong. TBH, it's kind of rude that your friends know that you're vegan and can't find a restaurant that at least has some vegetarian options.", "NTA. Its your chosen diet and they knew it. That being said I'm a regular omnivore, and honestly even all the steak houses i been to had reasonable vegetarian alternatives. I could imagine it could have been an unintentional oversight if they assumed there would be a reasonable set of options too... have you spoken to anyone yet?", "I agree with other commenters that it\u2019s probably all NAH, but I also get where you\u2019re coming from and why you asked. I have a lot of dietary restrictions and while I don\u2019t hold it against people for not considering my diet when making plans (do you really wanna die on that hill?), it\u2019s extremely heartwarming when people do take it into consideration without my having to ask. I do think you could make the case that, if they are your close friends, they could make an effort to accommodate your diet and not allow you to be excluded bc of them. I have friends who won\u2019t suggest dinner plans unless they know there are options for me, but I think that\u2019s going above and beyond\u2014most of my friends don\u2019t even tend to remember my dietary restrictions lol and not even my family does that. I can see how you could say your friends are TAs for not making sure you were included and I think you\u2019d be justified in that. Then again, do you really wanna die on that hill? I know it can be hurtful, both other people just simply don\u2019t get it and mostly think it\u2019s annoying. Refusing to come to dinner isn\u2019t going to make it seems less annoying to anyone who feels that way. Just a pro tip from someone who understands this whole debacle\u2014just go to the dinner and order a side of veggies or rice or bread or whatever they offer. Fries. Side salad. A couple appetizers in place of an entree. Ask the kitchen if they can use oil rather than butter or put dressings/sauces on the side. Just participate as much as you can without making a thing of it. It\u2019ll more likely lead to people being more inclusive of you in the future than if you boycott the whole operation.", "NTA. I think it's reasonable and understandable that you didn't want to go there. Has someone on the group said something that makes you feel like might have been in the wrong?", "NTA.  Croatia is not great for vegans.

Most of them wanted to go anyway, but after another person of the group issued that they would dislike it if we wouldn\u2019t spend the dinner outside not as a group. Another of my friends also got I\u2019ll that evening so we came to terms to visit a better suited place the next day. All resolved very peacefully.\n\n- The main reason for me to ask this question is because I wanted to see if my point seems valid to others or if this was too picky from me (or not sensible from the others)\n\n- The other days were spent at the house and we arranged ourselves so that there was an option for anyone. I could just make my own dishes when they decided to eat meat/fish.\n\nThanks for all the answers so far \ud83d\ude0a", "NTA, your concern is valid, they can easily choose a restaurant that serves both meat and vegetarian dishes.", "NTA.

You agreed to all go to a restaurant together one time. *One time*. A group dinner out should accommodate everyone's dietary restrictions. It's totally fine that they want to eat at that restaurant but would it have killed them to go eat there another evening that wasn't your designated group activity evening?

A better way to frame this is that you refused to go to a restaurant that did not serve anything you could eat besides a side salad. You did not ask your friends to not go, you decided not to go. It sounds like an awful experience just sitting there watching others eat.", "NTA but you're not vegan. (I know the internet hates vegans so downvote me if you must, but I hope you at least read the whole message first.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI used to be like you. I was a vegan but then quickly caved to make my life easier while traveling/make things less awkward around friends. It took a while for me to realize I was giving up on my morals just because I was too lazy/afraid to handle it when things got hard. Now, if there isn't a vegan option I just don't eat. In most cases, though, there are at least veggies, rice, potatoes, and or bread. You can eat one meal that's lackluster as a vegan while traveling and not die.   \n\n\nMy friends now are probably more \"annoying\" about me being vegan than I am. They're the first ones to ask the waiter if there are any vegan options and to make sure that I'm okay with the restaurant chosen. Not saying you should pick new friends, but maybe your friends should value you and your lifestyle a bit more. Just because you're doing something that deviates from the norm doesn't mean you have to bend to the will of every non-vegan whenever you eat outside of your house.", "NTA\n\nThere was nothing for you to eat. Why would you go? I hope it was a one off that they didn't consider you.", "Fairs. I don\u2019t mind them enjoying a steak or whatever else. Just think it would have been mindful to go for a place where everyone would be able to find something. There would have also been restaurants that offer both vegetarian/vegan and meat dishes", "No, all good between us. It was more that I felt a little disappointed that they choose a restaurant that clearly had no options for me when there would have been good restaurants available, where everyone could have found something fitting to eat", "More of an internal conflict I guess. Just wanted to know if me refusing to join is bitchy in some way or if it is a legitimate feeling that I think it would have been easy to find a place for everyone and not go for the one single place that I would not be able to eat at.\n\nRegarding the labels, I only eat vegetarian dishes when there are no vegan options available. Since I live in a bigger German city, this is hardly the case and happens maybe 3-5 times a year. So I would personally consider myself a vegan as per the definition of trying to avoid harming animals as good as possible. I will take the argument that I could just not eat anything in these few cases, but it is important to me to not feel like I am limiting myself or be too annoying to go out with", "Mac and cheese has dairy and mashed potatoes most likely are made with butter. This person is vegan so no dairy. As a vegetarian not sure but I believe they still do not eat dairy. Correct me if I am wrong. Problem is restaurants will sometimes say vegan options and it will be a salad or plates of veggies.  Rabbit food.", "I have a feeling nobody did and the aim of this is for people to say how awful the friends are for going to a restaurant she can't eat at.\n\n\nWhich, yeh, its nice to accommodate your friends, but if going for meals together is frequent then I can see that once in a while they would want to go somewhere without having to compromise on someone else's dietary requirements.", "Um, never do this? Restaurants are not your personal kitchen and I have never heard of people placing pre orders for things that are not on the menu. Awful advice.", "Finding vegetarian dishes is easy, vegan is much harder.", "So they were just supposed to sit there and watch everyone else eat? BS.", "While you can buy steak at many places, a great steakhouse offers a level of meat that the other places don't offer. As a steak eater, even among steakhouses, some are better than others. This steakhouse may have been in that upper level that is not available near you and since you were all on vacation, they may have wanted to splurge on this.", "The menu offered no vegetables at all?", "Some of the better steakhouses focus on whats important. The meat", "This particular place might just be that special. I would try not to take it too personally. Maybe ask the restaurant if you can bring food in from outside? I keep strictly kosher and have to do this and most are totally cool with it.", "I understand that, maybe just express to them how you feel and how you hope things can be different next time", "I see your point, but at the same time, you have to consider that they have already been making concessions to go to places that carter to your restrictions until now and feel thay also have the right to go someplace they really want to.\n\nRemember, you're the one with restrictive diet, not them.\n\nUnless this happens all the time, then yes this would be really insensitive of them.", "Did you look and offer a different restaurant that might be better? Your the one with dietary restrictions so maybe YOU should try and find a place that could be better for everyone. The majority seem to be really into the other restaurant, so maybe the next night everyone could go to your choice. No one is the asshole for you saying no, YTA assuming they should do all the work.", "Just a side note. I (Dutch) visited Germany recently and was very surprised most kebab places advertised with vegetarian and/or vegan options. And a lot of the more traditional German restaurants had few options. I didn\u2019t expect the kebab places to be the progressive ones ;)\n\nI am a vegetarian and I ate great vegetarian or vegan food during my trip in Germany, varying from vegan kebab, to Indian curries, Turkish dishes, hamburgers, salads and veggie sushi!", "Yeah I mean they said they\u2019ll eat vegetarian if they have to. You\u2019re right that a vegan isn\u2019t going to eat dairy but they appear to be flexible.

The restaurant can say no.", "Yeah, but OP is a \u201cvegan\u201d except when they are not lol. They eat vegetarian meals when they go out.", "Yeah. Even in that situation, you\u2019re a dick for bailing on your friends on the one time they wanted to eat out during vacation.

Whenever a dish was not suited for my diet, I made an alternative meal for myself and we ate together.

Asking for them to make up a new dish that isn\u2019t on the menu? No.", "Oh hmmm then I\u2019m calling BS on this one. I doubt there was no option for vegetarian dishes other than a side salad.", "That\u2019s just not true. As friends you cannot pick somewhere your friend can\u2019t eat and expect them to come with you. OP did inform them that they couldn\u2019t go to this restaurant and apparently they went anyway. You don\u2019t choose a restaurant that only serves pork products if your friend is Muslim. You don\u2019t choose a pizza place that has no gluten free crust if your friend has Celiac. You don\u2019t go to a seafood place when your friend has a shellfish allergy.", "Because vegetables have bitter/savory/umami flavors that compliment the meat. Kinda like \u201cwho needs a wine list at a steakhouse?\u201d Because it tastes good in combination.", "Most \"steakhouses\" offer very little in way of vegetables, it's all about the meats. Some do offer different salads that have meat or seafood in them that she may be able to have removed but since she looked at the menu, maybe this steakhouse doesn't offer them.", "Also OP didn\u2019t stop them from going! OP set a reasonable boundary\u2014 I won\u2019t attend if YOU go but YOU are welcome to go.", "Sometimes people forget especially if you don\u2019t go out often. Communicate, make it clear.\n\nAnd, for some groups, it would be essentially \u201ceither I go or nobody goes\u201d. That was never made clear that the OP was fine they were going.", "As a side item. To compliment the meat", "Did you read the post? OP told them they would stay home if they chose that place.", "Yep! Exactly. I don\u2019t think we disagree with each other\u2026", "Yeah. For many friend groups that\u2019s a deal breaker. If you\u2019ve got one person who says they won\u2019t go, the entire group won\u2019t go.\n\nYou\u2019d be stinking up the whole night if you decide to not go.", "Thats the point, there might have vegetables on the dish, but not \"only vegetable dish\".", "You have some really toxic friends.", "Every steakhouse I have ever been to, you order your steak cut and you order your sides. Separately.", "One person is certainly enough to be a dealbreaker", "And even the vegetable sides frequently have meat in them (particularly bacon)."]}
