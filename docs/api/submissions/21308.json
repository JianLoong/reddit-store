My brother and I are both atheists, and we live away from home with our partners (unmarried). \n\nI got my first bf at 19, and when we came to stay at my mother\u2019s place, I could not share a bed with him. As a young adult and wanting to keep the peace, I stuck to her rules. I always remained respectful when in her house, and whilst we did have sex we always did this when she wasn\u2019t in the house so as to not get caught or upset anyone. By the time I was 21, I had a conversation with my mom that she should trust and respect me as an adult, to allow my bf to sleep in my bed. Around this time my mom was more liberal, had a bf of her own that she would share a bed with, and she was okay about it. \n\nI was single between ages 22-24, but my mom was still with her partner, and when he would stay with her they always slept in the same bed. I moved back home with her during Covid. One night I heard my mom and her partner have sex in the room opposite me, so I know she also has had sex outside of marriage. I told her I didn\u2019t mind what she did, but it was gross to hear them at it, and her and her partner kindly apologised to me for being loud, no biggy. \n\nFast forward to the present, I\u2019m happily living with a new bf and we\u2019ve previously spent time at my mom\u2019s house where we\u2019ve slept in the same bed. I never asked my mom about this, I thought that she was cool with it from her own actions and my last bf, so we just went ahead and did this as normal. \n\nHowever, my brother spent some time at home recently and went out for dinner with my mom. She\u2019s reverted back to her traditional ways, and last year split with her partner. She told my brother she is not happy anymore with the sleeping arrangements when our partners stay, and when we go back for Christmas this year, she wants us to revert back to separate rooms when our partners are over. My grandmother is now moving in with my mom, who is even more religious and strict, and she does not want to hurt my grandmother\u2019s feelings by unmarried couples sharing rooms. \n\nI think this is hypocritical and I\u2019m tired of not being respected as an adult in this situation, when she previously been okay with it. WIBTA if I stay at my bf\u2019s parents for Christmas instead if she decides to enforce this ridiculous rule? I know how much it would upset her if I didn\u2019t come home, but at 27 years old and living with a partner, enforcing separate rooms seems pretty ridiculous.", "created_utc": 1688477145, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14qf6is/aita_if_i_dont_come_home_for_christmas_because_of/", "score": 106, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
