Needless to say, we've broken up since then. Now with an extra ticket I didn't need, I made a social media post asking if anyone wanted to see the show with me, saying they didn't have to pay me back for the ticket, I just didn't want it to go to waste. It was kind of a shot in the dark since the band isn't too popular, but one of my friends said she'd love to come with me, despite not knowing the band, because she's been looking for new music to listen to.\n\nWhen we got to the venue, it was made very clear that the band had a very strict \"no recording or photography during the show\" rule. There were signs posted everywhere, and one of the venue staff even made an announcement onstage right before the show started that filming or taking photos was absolutely prohibited and that anyone caught using a phone or camera during the performance would be ejected from the venue. I don't usually like to take photos or videos during concerts anyways so this rule didn't really affect me.\n\nAnyways, about halfway through the show my friend whips out her phone and starts recording. We were right at the front so obviously, this caught the attention of a security guard and he approached her and told her that she needed to leave. I wasn't really listening to their conversation because I really just wanted to enjoy the show without distractions, but I could tell she was kind of arguing with him. When she finally stopped putting up a fight and agreed to leave, the guard turned to me and said, \"Are y'all together?\" And I just shrugged and said, \"No, we're not.\"\n\nWhen I got home that night, my phone had been blown up with texts from her saying I was a horrible friend for not standing up for her and abandoning her like that. Honestly, I don't think there was anything to \"stand up\" for - if she hadn't done anything wrong that would be one thing, but it was made very clear that filming during the show would result in removal from the venue, so I'm not sure what she expected would happen when she started filming. I could have just resold the ticket to an actual fan, but I gave it to her without expecting any reimbursement because of her interest in \"discovering new bands,\" and I wasn't about to miss a concert I'd paid for and spent months looking forward to because she couldn't follow a simple rule. It also feels worth it to mention we had both driven to the venue separately and met up there, so it's not like I left her without any way to get herself home. Still, she's really mad at me and says I betrayed her.

First, you could have sold the ticket or just posted that you were going leave the ticket at willcall for anyone who wanted it.  Instead, you solicited friends to attend.  That means you clearly placed value on going to the show with someone you knew.  That\u2019s normal because most people want to experience shows/events with friends because shared experiences bring friends closer together.  So your friend had a reasonable expectation that her presence at the event was important, or at least beneficial, to you.  \n\nSecond, you straight lied to security that you weren\u2019t together.  That\u2019s some cold blooded, Biblical level betrayal right there.  You could have said \u201cyes, but I wasn\u2019t using my phone.  Or yes, I\u2019ll keep her phone with me the rest of the night\u201d or anything.  Instead, you chose to lie.  If your friend was getting kicked out for fighting or being disruptive, it\u2019s more understandable.  But it\u2019s 2023, people whip out their phone at a concert almost instinctively at this point.  Did you tell her to stop it before getting spotted?  \n\nUltimately, it\u2019s your friends fault for getting herself kicked out and the fact that you guys came in separate cars shows that it was at least contemplated that one of you could leave early if needed so you aren\u2019t the AH.\n\nBut for some perspective, would you be upset if this friend walked up to you and said \u201cJust so we are clear, the band Coldplay is more important to me than our friendship\u201d because that is what your actions told her.", "NTA\n\nYour friend is an entitled piece of work.\n\nNo need for her in your life.", "The answer shouldn't matter as this is AITA not \"Should I apologize to my friend even though they were dead wrong and tried to get me kicked out of a concert because they couldn't follow the one rule there\" sub.", "are you....are you telling me how to form my own opinion??", "Well, you were asking for info on a fairly straightforward situation.
