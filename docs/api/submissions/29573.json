A RULE is something you set for others. If she wants to set a boundary that SHE won't eat food that's been there longer than a semester, have at it, Hoss. However, she cannot singlehandedly create  rules around food that others need to follow if you are roommates that are sharing a space, ESPECIALLY when it has nothing to do with the safety or well-being of the household. This is just nonsense & a power trip & it needs to be addressed by ALL of you. \n\nSit down & talk about this as a household & as others have suggested, split the Freezer into 3 sections & maintain your individual space. I know it's awkward to have to deal with conflict but such is life with roommates. This is just noise in the grand scheme of things & it's annoying but nothing is to be gained by trying to ignore her as she seems to be intent on finding fault. Call a house meeting & ask her to explain how an unopened package of veggie burgers that are not past their expiration date are \"bad\", & then suggest the solution of splitting the Fridge/Freezer. \n\n Technically, vegetables in the freezer can remain so indefinitely - they have expiration dates & guidelines because the flavour,  texture & nutrition breakdown after a certain point, but they won't go \"bad\" per se. Food safety IS important & understanding the why behind the rules is a good thing - it almost seems as though she has looked up the information here to have a \"reason\" to get huffy with you.
