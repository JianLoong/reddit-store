The issue was being dealt with.GF need to mind her own.", "She has the \"I need to be the main character of every situation!\" syndrome, eh? Was she drunk or high?", "NTA. No need to insert herself. Not safe at that point either, especially after a bar. You needed to let her know that was not a smart decision. Why get involved? Like what did she really think she was going to do at that point.", "NTA. Never get involve into a fight, a disagreement or an altercation. That's a good way to get hurt yourself. Just stay away.", "NTA she was putting your life and her life in danger for what?", "NTA. \n\nEVERY conflict resolution, de-escalation, first aid training, I've been on (and that's a fair few) says **safety** first, otherwise the paramedics will just be likely dealing with more casualties. As the police were there, I am adding that your gf was an A, and seems like 'main character' action to me.", "INFO\n\nYou had 3,000 characters, yet barely used 500.

She is just super empathetic and the alcohol probably played into her 'empathetic' decision to get involved.. but it was all well intentioned.", "I don't see how it's ever in the right to insert yourself into a situation you're completely uninvolved with when police are already on the scene and actively handling it. \n\nScenario 1: She is trying to help the detainee. Why would you ever randomly go against authority that is already known for being volatile for that? It'll just add more stress, tension, and mess to the situation and the police may get more jumpy with more people ganging up against them.\n\nScenario 2: She's on the side of the police. Then what? What could she possibly help with that the officers wouldn't see as her being in the way?", "i didnt think 3000 words was required to tell a straight forward story.... its pretty obvious her intentions where good?? how do you take a girl inserting herself in a hostile and possibly violent situation where a girl is crying for her boyfriend whiles hes being aggressive with the police as an action of ill intent. The only part i missed out was why the situation came to be in the first place because i dont fully know or stuck around long enough to but i assume it was a fight between two drunk men and she was trying to de escalate which my gf obvs wanted to help her in.", "LOL this is a joke right? They didn\u2019t need 3000 words to make their case. None of those questions change anything. It\u2019s none of her business. NTA", "what more details do you need, she tried to step into a physical altercation although with good intentions. The man was very drunk and hostile and the police and his gf where trying to de escalate what seemed like a fight between himself and another party.", "Well when it happens you need to empathetically walk away and leave her to her own devices, she'll only need one of these situations to not respond well to a random interloper to learn her lesson.", "exactly regardless of why she got involved, if you see a group of large men fighting and bystanders getting hurt because of that, do you play hero and involve yourself when that could put ur self a risk and by association the ppl your with?", "NTA. The police are already there and don't want her \"help\" without asking for it: AKA being a witness.", "Ashe tried to get between the police and the drunk?", "I think you just need to make it clear to your gf that she isn't trained in de-escalation and even acts done with good intentions can lead to more trouble for either herself or the other party. There's no need to scold her for it. Just get her to understand why there's professionals trained for de-escalation. Also cut her some slack if she has had some drinks that night. Alcohol isn't exactly the sponsor of the best ideas.", "She tried to get between the girl and the drunk", "the scolding came more from the fear I could have been killed... in cases of violence in public places especially with alcohol invoiced - 99% of victims are men. She went in without second though partly because she has never had to think of escalation in the form of violence when it comes to these sorts of things. At the end of the day I'm the one getting laid out and put in hospital if she gets involved.", "Info: in what way did your girlfriend \u201cinsert herself\u201d into the conflict?", "Nta\n\nThat wasn't smart on her part at all. She needed to be told that.", "My wife is like that, I've gotten better over the years at steering her away from such situations, particularly now we are older and she is not as physically capable if it turns nasty.\nNTA, you never know how bad it could get.", "She may have good intentions, but there are people out there with bad ones and the cops were already there.\n\nThe average person doesn\u2019t understand that one punch is all it takes to kill someone. Happens all the time.", "Seemed clear enough that the situation was none of her business. And the police were already there dealing with it.", "80% who clam to be super \u201cempathetic\u201d just want to be the main characters and think by being super nice and always seeing the good in people is the way to do it.", "I believe police shouldn\u2019t get drunk"]}
