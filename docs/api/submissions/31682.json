I thought nothing of it and a week had past and it had arrived the morning of Thanksgiving. I was super excited because now I could use one of their new scents to smell good on Thanksgiving day. I hopped in the shower and used it and I smelled really good. 3 hours later most of my family started to arrived and soon so did my friend and his son Nathan. Before they all arrived I had used one of the deodorants that came with it and left it out in the open, A fatal mistake. I started to chat with my friend and Nathan had ran off and I thought nothing of it. \n\nLater I had to use the restroom so I excused myself. When I returned to the table, Nathan was lying next to the stick holding his stomach on the floor. Nathan had started to cry and I looked at the stick and it had a bite mark into it. Everyone was around Nathan so I pushed through the crowd of people and asked Nathan if he had eaten some of it and he nodded it approval. Nathan then started to seize and 911 was called. They arrived and his friend explained that his son had eaten a part of the deodorant and felt horrible and started to seize. My friend and his son had went to the hospital.\n\nToday they updated me on that Nathan was fatally allergic to an ingredient in the deodorant and is currently in a coma which it is unknown when he will wake up. My friend has blocked me on all platforms and is refusing to speak to me and is blasting me on facebook saying that I caused all this and we reckless and irresponsible for leaving the deodorant out knowing that his son is fatally allergic to, I had no idea that his son was allergic to anything.

This child would enter your personal space\n3. This child would eat your deodorant \n\nIt's unreasonable to assume this would happen with a child old enough to be allowed to run around unsupervised.", "Since you had no idea Nathaniel has any allergies, NTA.\n\nIt's actually not easy to child-proof a home; even if you hadn't forgotten to put away the deodorant, the poor child could've probably gotten into something else dangerous because he was unsupervised and not (yet?) taught not to eat unknown things.\n\nYour friend's reaction is understandable, though. While not fair to you, it's easier to air that you were careless around his son than to admit that he himself was negligent. His mind may clear up later on, but at the moment he's probably in a state of suspended panic.", "As a parent, I say NTA. I have a child who is allergic to peanuts and I scan the room once I get anywhere for exposure. Even when I\u2019m at a friend\u2019s house that knows about the allergy. Your friend is angry and needs someone to blame. I would do the same\u2026.because it\u2019s easy and means I don\u2019t have to look inward.", "Hang on, what?! How old is this kid? NTA, I have never really considered hiding my deodorant to be at all a normal part of basic child proofing for guests. I\u2019ve worked with children for 13 years and I\u2019ve truly never seen a child eat deodorant. I\u2019ve seen them try to eat plenty of other non-food items, but deodorant?! This is not your fault and your friend will hopefully come to terms with it being the insane freak accident that it was soon.", "If you had no idea, you are NTA. I\u2019m also curious to how old this son is, because biting a stick of deodorant is something the parents should teach their son not to do.", "NTA, but you have to understand that you are now dead to that friend.

Especially when you had no idea the kid was allergic to an ingredient.\n\nYour friend is definitely TA for taking his biased version of the incident to social media and turning people against you.\n\nI hope the child recovers from this.", "NTA  but wtf how old is this kid?? If they are young enough to EAT deodorant then they are too young to run off without direct supervision. Your friend should\u2019ve been watching his child. I have never heard of hiding deodorant as a way of baby proofing. Cleaning chemicals, tiny beads, thc gummies, etc sure, but deodorant??? Do you also need to hide the TV remotes so he doesn\u2019t pluck the batteries out for a snack? Plastic wrap your pillows so he doesn\u2019t go to town on the stuffing?? Do you need to hide the hand soap? Seriously, does your friend think you should\u2019ve just hosted everybody in an empty room, like what an insane response. Try watching your own kid for a change. and who doesn\u2019t INFORM the person hosting them if their child has a FATAL allergy? \n\nNo, he\u2019s upset that his own negligence might take his child away from him and he\u2019s blaming you because he mentally cannot handle the stress, the grief, AND the guilt at the same time. You did nothing wrong.", "YTA for this bullshit story.\n\nOP has been asked several times how old Nathan is. He\u2019s refused to answer that question. Why?", "NTA you\u2019re not the parent, you\u2019re not responsible for the child being left unattended to be able to eat something they shouldn\u2019t have eaten. \n\nYou cannot be responsible for not removing an allergen when you weren\u2019t aware it was an allergen, again this is down to the parent to enforce until the kid is old enough to learn.\n\nEither Nathan is old enough that he should know what makes him react, I\u2019ve had 3yo rattle off all their allergies perfectly due to having it drilled in by parents from day 1. Or Nathan is still very young, in which case the parent should have been watching them. Their kid, their responsibility! \n\nSeems like the friend is just trying to scapegoat you for their parental negligence", "NTA \nDoesnt even matter if you knew he had allergies to it, this isn't something you would predict happening. You didn't expect him to touch it very much less try to eat it, plus it sounds like it was in your own space in the bathroom \n\nassuming the kid is young or has pica the worst you are is careless leaving it out, but even that doesnt make it your fault", "I'm sorry but who on earth anticipates a kid *eating* your deodorant stick? \n\nNTA", "NTA\n1. Why did he eat the deodorant?! Like what allergy makes you do that???\n2. EVERY time I make something for friends I ask for a list of allergies/dietary restrictions so I make sure I avoid EVERYTHING to avoid these types of situations\u2026\n3. Why wasn\u2019t your friend looking for him if it was longer than normal of the kid disappearing???\n4.

How the fuck should you have known he goes around eating stuff that is not for eating? If the kid has allergies OR a tendency to eat stuff that is inedible (which can always cause harm!) the parents absolutely need to inform you about it so you can prepare accordingly.\n\nI feel for the kid, because this is a disorder that needs to be treated and I really hope he recovers. But this is not on you. It's on the parents. And they know it. They are just afraid and lashing out. Give them some time.", "Umm WTF? Idiot child eats your deodorant, and you are somehow to blame rather than the idiot parents who were obviously not watching their child. Wow OP, NTA!\n\nI mean I feel bad for the kid, but parents need to take in a little responsibility by watching their child and accountability for their actions when they don't.", "Hi. This is absolutely b.s 100% made-up, did not happen b.s. ridiculous waste of time.", "NTA. He should have been watching his kid and taught his kid not to touch other people\u2019s belongings.", "IDK man, Maybe your friend should teach his son, not to eat deodorant. \n\nNTA", "NTA, your friend didn't tell you that his kid was allergic to it and so you had no reason to think you needed to treat it as a dangerous object and put it somewhere his kid couldn't interact with it. I would strongly advise setting that record straight to the public instead of letting him use you as a scapegoat for his own failure to inform people of his son having a fatal allergy to something.  Don't let him turn you into his whipping boy just because you feel bad for him that his incompetence has gotten his kid put in a coma.", "Nta- how old was this kid?", "NTA. I have serious allergies. I have NEVER considered that a deodorant might contain something that would trigger an allergy. Even if I was told that a child had an allergy, I would not be looking at deodorants as a thing to remove.

Grief especially can make us act irrationally as we try to navigate it.\n\nEven if my best friend had been in your shoes I'd need a break from him as I tried to readjust to my young son being comatose and possibly never turning 5. \n\nLosing a child can end a good marriage; it could certainly end a friendship.\n\nYou're not at fault but this is a really shitty situation.", "INFO: did you know his son had any allergies", "INFO: How old is Nathaniel?

I'm 33 now, I am extra cautious of my surrounding. I've been in hospital a few times (and endless comas) due to my allergies of food stores not listing ingredients correctly. I always check ingredients and if I'm not sure, I ask my partner to taste it first. He's got a sensitive palate, and when he says I can't have that, I don't eat it.

There is evidence that Neanderthals deliberately buried their dead and occasionally even marked their graves with offerings, such as flowers. No other primates, and no earlier human species, had ever practiced this sophisticated and symbolic behavior.\u201d\n\nThey made tools and coordinated hunts, including devising traps that they herded prey into so the group could safely defeat very large animals. \n\nThe  evidence shows that tribal members showed signs of living years after devastating injuries that would have left them unable to hunt or do labor intensive tasks.

I\u2019m so sorry this happened but it\u2019s definitely not your fault", "NTA the way you tell the story but if everyone involved thinks YTA as you say, my guess is we're only getting a version of the story that they will not agree with.", "Um NTA how the F were you gonna predict your friends kid was gonna EAT deodorant?!!", "If he was fatally allergic to an ingredient in the deodorant, he would be dead. \n\nThat\u2019s like someone claiming they were electrocuted and lived to tell you about it. \n\nBTW: You never mentioned how old this kid was. Depending on his age, one would think a child would have enough common sense to not eat something like deodorant.", "Info: how old is this kid? \n\nAnd second NTA. As a parent, it\u2019s your responsibility as the guest to watch your child and to be aware of what\u2019s happening with them not the host.

I\u2019m not blaming the parent, but the child is not your responsibility and you had no way of seeing into the future. I\u2019m so sorry this is on your chest, I know you must feel so sick to your stomach. In this moment all you can do is be supportive and not respond to the negative thoughts.

That sounds awful. Do they have proof they told you about the allergy? If not then it\u2019s not your fault. If the kid had fatal allergies the parent should not let him out of their sight.

It was a terrible accident. NTA!", "NTA.  You couldn't possibly know that (1) the son would actually try to eat deodorant or (2) that he was highly allergic to one of the deodorant's ingredients.

There is no reason to assume that Nathan had severe allergies, or that he would try to eat a stick of deodorant.

You didn\u2019t know he had this allergy and it is not normal for anyone to expect a child to eat deodorant.  It was an accident, just let your friend process all of this and let him know you are thinking of him and his son. When things like this happen, in grief and fear, folks can blame people for a situation.  You are not to blame.", "NTA. More bad parents blaming their shit parenting on someone else. Could never be their fault that their kid wandered off unsupervised in someone else\u2019s home and decided to bite something.", "NTA. His parents knew he had an allergy and/or the urge to put random things in his mouth AND EAT THEM so they should have been monitoring and also share that with everyone ahead of time.

You didn\u2019t know he was allergic. And also, what age is this child\u2026 if he\u2019s old enough to be going to the bathroom on his own, old enough to know not to eat sticks of deodorant?

If a child has allergies it's up to the parents to let people know.", "NTA...lord, people need to get ahold of their kids", "NTA\n\nYou were not aware of the allergy, no one suspects a child will eat it. If the child needs that much supervision to be told not to eat things then the parents should have had more attention on the child.\n\n It could\u2019ve been something else if not the deodorant. Possible that maybe the child could have got to the soap if the deodorant was away anyways. But the what if rabbit hole is a deep one to go down.\n\nIn general the situation sucks, and your friend is acting more on emotion because it\u2019s a high stress situation (doesn\u2019t excuse their actions but gives more of an understanding of why they are acting that way).", "How old is this kid? If he's anywhere over 2 he should know not to eat deodorant, and if he's anywhere over 4 he should know to check ingredients before he eats anything in case he's allergic. That's like, basic things to teach a kid with deadly allergies. Fuck, not eating deodorant is a basic thing that every kid should know. Why the hell are they blaming you for their kid being an idiot?\n\nNTA", "Info: How old is Nathan? Is he 3? 8? \nRegardless if he's 2 or 3 and puts everything in his mouth, why wasn't your friend watching him (wrangling him)? If he's 8 he knows you don't take a bite out of something that's not food. Either way it was an unfortunate accident. You have no idea about his allergies. Most kids would have had a tummy ache and great smelling breath for awhile. You could not have foreseen this. Of course, neither could the father. Right now the situation is intense and your friend needs someone or something to be angry at. Unfortunately that person's you. He's feeling helpless and being angry at you helps him feel less helpless.\nYou're not a Bond Villain, or a bad person. This is just an insanely unfortunate event and I'm praying for Nathan. This isn't your fault tho. NTA", "NTA but definitely call a lawyer. Firstly the child shouldn\u2019t just be eating things, you had no idea of his allergy and his parents should have told you if it\u2019s a serious allergy.", "What could\u2019ve possibly given you the impression that their kid would *EAT* your *DEODORANT*???? \n\nThis is not your fault in any way", "Who the fuck eats deodorant?", "NTA - You did not know about the allergy so did not know to take special care, But even then how old and what's wrong with them that they took a bite out the soap and ate it. That could not possibly taste good or have a nice texture.", "NTA. He ate a deodorant\u2026wtf", "NTA\n\nI dunno how old Nathan is, but kids young enough to think taking a bite out of deodorant is a good idea probably should be supervised by their parents or actually designated watchful adults.\n\nEven if you had known the allergy (which it sounds like even they may not have) you didn't feed it to him.\n\nI hope he is okay, and I hope your friend calms down when they are less scared. (My guess is right now they are freaked out and it's easier to blame you than face fear, ESPECIALLY if your friend is afraid it might be their own fault. (As awful as it feels to you, blaming you might be the only way they survive this without falling apart. So, send them love and don't take it personally, they are just too scared to be rational.)", "The only thing I could think of is that he may have PICA. A lot of kids on the spectrum have PICA. I took care of a young man that was autistic and non verbal. His PICA was so bad that he would eat cigarette butts and just flap his hands and act like it was nothing. He ate EVERYTHING! We had someone watching him 24/7. If this kid does have PICA, he should have also been supervised 24/7 by his Dad. \n\nMy daughter has autism. She's almost 16 now but I watched her like a hawk in people's houses when she was younger. Even though she is \"high functioning\" (She's the type of kid with exceptional abilities to calculate things like dates, times and recall minute details... it's like she has a huge database in her head) she was also BIG trouble. She was the type of little kid in her younger years who would pump out all your soap into the sink to play with it because the texture felt good to her and spray every damn perfume in your cabinet on herself because the smells were pleasing to her, etc. She also drank from someone else's cup once thinking it was hers because she would never pay attention. So yeah, I spent her younger years following her around and as a single Mom I was obviously responsible for her. \n\nI feel bad for OP and the kid. That's awful, but OP basically saved the kid's life, had no idea this kid would eat deodorant, etc. It's just an awful situation all around \ud83e\udd7a. I think the Dad feels guilty and is looking for someone to blame...", "NTA he should have been watching his child. And why is he eating deodorant.", "Seriously. I wonder how old the kid is.", "Actually his friends response is not understandable because DAD DIDN'T KNOW EITHER!", "Friends reaction is understandable. But not fair. They should have expressed these allergies sooner, been watching their kid. Lotsa things they as a knowledgeable parent should have done but instead they blame their friend who knew nothing. If the parent didn't know either until now, even bigger reason not to try and destroy someone's reputation  NTA.\n\nI fully understand breaking off contact after something like this, not blasting them on Facebook like they have nothing bigger to worry about", "Even barring the allergy, when I take my daughter to someone else's house she is closely supervised. \n\nA - I don't want her to get injured somehow\n\nB - I don't want her breaking their stuff.", "I can't call his friend an asshole. His son might die. How do you expect him to react?!", ">If the kid truly has a life threatening allergy then his parents should have an epipen\n\nReading OP's post, my initial impression was that they didn't know about the allergy until the kid was hospitalized (dad's reaction sounded more emotionally based than anything else to me, too).

He got a delivery on Thanksgiving morning? Also what kind of allergic reaction goes \"stomachache---> seizure------> coma\"?

However, you could have something that *looks* a bit like a seizure due to lack of oxygen once your airways have closed up. Could be the real medical terminology being lost in translation.
