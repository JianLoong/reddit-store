Before they all arrived I had used one of the deodorants that came with it and left it out in the open, A fatal mistake. I started to chat with my friend and Nathan had ran off and I thought nothing of it. \n\nLater I had to use the restroom so I excused myself. When I returned to the table, Nathan was lying next to the stick holding his stomach on the floor. Nathan had started to cry and I looked at the stick and it had a bite mark into it. Everyone was around Nathan so I pushed through the crowd of people and asked Nathan if he had eaten some of it and he nodded it approval. Nathan then started to seize and 911 was called. They arrived and his friend explained that his son had eaten a part of the deodorant and felt horrible and started to seize. My friend and his son had went to the hospital.\n\nToday they updated me on that Nathan was fatally allergic to an ingredient in the deodorant and is currently in a coma which it is unknown when he will wake up. My friend has blocked me on all platforms and is refusing to speak to me and is blasting me on facebook saying that I caused all this and we reckless and irresponsible for leaving the deodorant out knowing that his son is fatally allergic to, I had no idea that his son was allergic to anything.

This child would enter your personal space\n3. This child would eat your deodorant \n\nIt's unreasonable to assume this would happen with a child old enough to be allowed to run around unsupervised.", "Since you had no idea Nathaniel has any allergies, NTA.\n\nIt's actually not easy to child-proof a home; even if you hadn't forgotten to put away the deodorant, the poor child could've probably gotten into something else dangerous because he was unsupervised and not (yet?) taught not to eat unknown things.\n\nYour friend's reaction is understandable, though. While not fair to you, it's easier to air that you were careless around his son than to admit that he himself was negligent. His mind may clear up later on, but at the moment he's probably in a state of suspended panic.", "As a parent, I say NTA. I have a child who is allergic to peanuts and I scan the room once I get anywhere for exposure. Even when I\u2019m at a friend\u2019s house that knows about the allergy. Your friend is angry and needs someone to blame. I would do the same\u2026.because it\u2019s easy and means I don\u2019t have to look inward.", "Hang on, what?! How old is this kid? NTA, I have never really considered hiding my deodorant to be at all a normal part of basic child proofing for guests. I\u2019ve worked with children for 13 years and I\u2019ve truly never seen a child eat deodorant. I\u2019ve seen them try to eat plenty of other non-food items, but deodorant?! This is not your fault and your friend will hopefully come to terms with it being the insane freak accident that it was soon.", "If you had no idea, you are NTA. I\u2019m also curious to how old this son is, because biting a stick of deodorant is something the parents should teach their son not to do.", "NTA, but you have to understand that you are now dead to that friend.

Especially when you had no idea the kid was allergic to an ingredient.\n\nYour friend is definitely TA for taking his biased version of the incident to social media and turning people against you.\n\nI hope the child recovers from this.", "NTA  but wtf how old is this kid?? If they are young enough to EAT deodorant then they are too young to run off without direct supervision. Your friend should\u2019ve been watching his child. I have never heard of hiding deodorant as a way of baby proofing. Cleaning chemicals, tiny beads, thc gummies, etc sure, but deodorant??? Do you also need to hide the TV remotes so he doesn\u2019t pluck the batteries out for a snack? Plastic wrap your pillows so he doesn\u2019t go to town on the stuffing?? Do you need to hide the hand soap? Seriously, does your friend think you should\u2019ve just hosted everybody in an empty room, like what an insane response. Try watching your own kid for a change. and who doesn\u2019t INFORM the person hosting them if their child has a FATAL allergy? \n\nNo, he\u2019s upset that his own negligence might take his child away from him and he\u2019s blaming you because he mentally cannot handle the stress, the grief, AND the guilt at the same time.

Or Nathan is still very young, in which case the parent should have been watching them. Their kid, their responsibility! \n\nSeems like the friend is just trying to scapegoat you for their parental negligence", "NTA Doesnt even matter if you knew he had allergies to it this isn't something you would predict happening, you didn't expect him to touch it very much less try to eat it it sounds like it was in your own space \n\nassuming the kid is young or has pica the worst you are is careless leaving it out, but even that doesnt make it your fault", "I'm sorry but who on earth anticipates a kid *eating* your deodorant stick? \n\nNTA", "NTA\n1. Why did he eat the deodorant?! Like what allergy makes you do that???\n2.

How the fuck should you have known he goes around eating stuff that is not for eating? If the kid has allergies OR a tendency to eat stuff that is inedible (which can always cause harm!) the parents absolutely need to inform you about it so you can prepare accordingly.\n\nI feel for the kid, because this is a disorder that needs to be treated and I really hope he recovers. But this is not on you. It's on the parents. And they know it. They are just afraid and lashing out. Give them some time.", "Umm WTF? Idiot child eats your deodorant, and you are somehow to blame rather than the idiot parents who were obviously not watching their child. Wow OP, NTA!", "Hi. This is absolutely b.s 100% made-up, did not happen b.s. ridiculous waste of time.", "NTA. He should have been watching his kid and taught his kid not to touch other people\u2019s belongings.", "IDK man, Maybe your friend should teach his son, not to eat deodorant. \n\nNTA", "NTA, your friend didn't tell you that his kid was allergic to it and so you had no reason to think you needed to treat it as a dangerous object and put it somewhere his kid couldn't interact with it. I would strongly advise setting that record straight to the public instead of letting him use you as a scapegoat for his own failure to inform people of his son having a fatal allergy to something.  Don't let him turn you into his whipping boy just because you feel bad for him that his incompetence has gotten his kid put in a coma.", "Nta- how old was this kid?", "NTA. I have serious allergies. I have NEVER considered that a deodorant might contain something that would trigger an allergy. Even if I was told that a child had an allergy, I would not be looking at deodorants as a thing to remove.

I blame your friend solely on this for not disclosing his son's allergies and also for not teaching his son not to eat everything he can see. I've been allergic to anything citrus since I was a baby.

I'm 33 now, I am extra cautious of my surrounding. I've been in hospital a few times (and endless comas) due to my allergies of food stores not listing ingredients correctly. I always check ingredients and if I'm not sure, I ask my partner to taste it first. He's got a sensitive palate, and when he says I can't have that, I don't eat it. It's a struggle, but you do get used to it eventually.", "Sorry but who eats a deodorant stick.

This was really a freak accident.\n\nAlso, I know one of the things people are saying is \"the kid should have been supervised\" but honestly, kids can do the craziest things, really not blaming your friend either, even a parent who supervises their kids well can have something happen to their kids,  it really doesn't take much. I'm not a parent but I know there's a lot of responsibilities for taking care of kids.\n\nHopefully the child has a speedy recovery.", "NTA. \n\nI have to ask how old was this kid?

Behind a *closed* gate.   \nThe neighbour couple demanded we stop feeding the strays because their 2-year-old might open the gate - which she could hardly reach - go into our garden, and eat the kibble.

It was immediately obvious it was something I shouldn\u2019t have in my mouth and I spit it out. I can\u2019t believe this kid would have swallowed deodorant once he bit into it. And if his allergy is so severe that just having the deodorant in his mouth for a second can cause a coma the friend should have an epipen, should be closely supervising his child in unfamiliar places, should alert others in advance to the allergy when he is going places, and should be teaching his child not to put random things in their mouth.", "I mean if it\u2019s a deodorant ingredient maybe they didn\u2019t know beforehand he was allergic but still.

You would only try to keep it out of the foods you prepare and the living spaces.", "NTA\n\nIf the parents knew their child had a deadly allergy they should have informed you\n\nEspecially *before a meal*\n\nIm really assuming the ingredient is also a food product (like coconut or something), something a child who would eat deodorant would really have exposure to since kids don\u2019t wear deodorant\n\nEd: want to be clear because like. This is a horrible situation and a child is involved that I really just think this is a tragedy and I don\u2019t think I should be the one to point the finger at anyone. I think in the future you now know maybe don\u2019t leave deodorant around because kids might eat it, but I wouldn\u2019t have thought of that either to be honest. I just don\u2019t think this should eat you alive really, do your best to support the child", "I did the same!! I had some really odd cravings too.

If this story is real, dad definitely does not want to take accountability. I know the feeling, having the urge to take your guilt out on someone else for \u201cfailing\u201d as a parent. It\u2019s hard to look at your mistakes and own up to them. It\u2019s way easier to say, \u201cWell you shouldn\u2019t have left that out knowing a kid was coming!\u201d Than to say, \u201cWell, I shouldn\u2019t have left my kid alone knowing I\u2019m in someone else\u2019s space.\u201d", "They\u2019re saying his negligence caused their son to end up in a coma.
