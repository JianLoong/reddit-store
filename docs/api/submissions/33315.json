Tell your doctor's office.  Tell your school counselor.  Tell other relatives (they may be able to pick it up for you without your mom knowing if they're over 18).  Keep bringing it up with everyone until you get what you need.  See if mail order is an option. Ask your mom about it every day.  Be obnoxious.  Be aggressive.  Be persistent.  Don't back down.  You have to be your own advocate.", "Please show this to your mom..\nGet your daughter the fucking inhaler!\nYour daughter can\u2019t breathe!!", "This!\n\nPeople think that just because the cancer is gone that everything is all good. Not always the case. Chemo and radiation run absolute mayhem on your body. And things can pop up down the road. \n\nBreathing issues NEED to be addressed. That is not normal to have that type of problem. In addition to the inhaler, Mom should be pushing the doctors to look into this more. There is a reason and it needs to be discovered and treated properly. This could very well be caused by prior treatments. \n\nMy Dad had throat cancer that was caught early. His oncologist actually told us that if one were to get cancer, his was the type to get. Initial scans were scary and they went in to remove his voice box because of the tumor. Come to find out that even though the tumor was sizable, it was only connected to him by a small thread of tissue. They got it all in one go and had him do radiation as a precaution. Dad never lost his voice,, as we were all expecting to happen.. Got the news within 1 year, cancer free! Yay! What followed was 10 years of him slowly wasting away because the radiation caused severe burns in his throat and he couldn't swallow properly. He wanted to eat. He tried just about everything under the sun. Nothing worked. He just kept losing weight. The medical doctors just kind of brushed it off as he was cancer free and people like to be skinny anyways. Never mind that my Dad went from a healthy 190 lbs for his height down to 112 lbs just before he passed away. He ended up passing away from being too thin/not enough weight. He had a minor heart attack and then a major heart attack within the span of 20 minutes. All four chambers of his heart blew up. For anyone who has lost someone to an ED...this is how they go. Not from starving, but from your body giving out on you because it cannot function at that low of a weight.", "I'm so sorry about your dad. My mom didn't get to go into remission but was written off as a chemo patient with a headache. Passed away 2 agonizing days later from a ruptured aneurysm.", "I am so sorry you lost your Mom. Our learned after my Dad passed away that looking for a doctor with post oncology experience is vital. So much can be triggered by past cancer treatments."]}
