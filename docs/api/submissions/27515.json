You weren\u2019t in charge of his care, your biz class parents were. If they wanted him to sleep, they should have told him to. If they wanted you to make sure he slept, they should have asked you.", "NTA. Your parents proved that they didn\u2019t check on either of you. They certainly could have walked less than 100 feet but THEY chose not to. You are not a parent, you are a brother.", "You are never TA for opening up another to world of books.  I cannot tell how many times I lost sleep because I was engrossed into a good read.  I survived as many do. He'll survive a little lost sleep, at age 13 that loss of sleep is really nothing for him.", "NTA- he\u2019s 13 not 3.

Them upgrading and leaving you and your brother behind is bad enough, but it sounds like they expected you to babysit your brother without even asking or setting any parameters.  \n\n\nHow were you supposed to know? NTA.", "NTA.\n\nYour parents didn't want to parent on the flight and this was their prize.", "NTA.  You are not his parent.  Also, and just a thought, but maybe he can't sleep on a plane.  I've been on a plane for 19 hours before and still was unable to sleep.", "NTA. Hell, I\u2019m super impressed that you kindly purchased him a book to read. And I kinda like that he stayed up all night reading. He\u2019s my kinda kid!", "NTA and not the parent. Your parents couldn't be bothered to walk back and check on him once for the entire duration of the flight?", "NTA. Not your job. One night to stay up reading is not a big deal anyway. \n\nAlso, they could\u2019ve walked to the back of the plane to check on him themselves.", "NTA\n\nBusiness class doesn\u2019t mean they get a break from being parents to a minor.", "NTA\n\nYour brother is 13 not 2 and even so it\u2019s not your responsibility to make sure he sleeps or stays awake. And if he decides to stay up, even with your parent\u2019s suggestion he sleeps, so he can be up for the trip, that\u2019s on your brother, and he\u2019ll learn from natural consequences.", "NTA he's 13 years old, not 6! How exactly were you supposed to make him go to sleep. Your parents shirked their responsibility onto you and are now upset you didn't parent the way they wanted you to. As if that's your job and not theirs.", "NTA. What is wrong with ur parents??", "NTA. You\u2019re not the parent. If it was so important that your brother do a certain thing, they could have either sat in coach or upgraded you both to business class. They didn\u2019t. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f so sad too bad. \n\nalso they\u2019re lame for not focusing on the bright side. Their kid was so enthralled with a book that he couldn\u2019t put it down. I would probably be proud, lol.", "NTA unreasonable for them to expect you to have control over your 13 year old sibling.", "NTA the kid will bounce back. At he should know by now when the body needs sleep.", "NTA. Neither are you your brother's parent. Mom and Dad are. If they wanted to make sure he slept when they wanted him to sleep, they should have moved him into business with them or at least gotten up and checked on him. They are the parents. This is on them, not you.", "NTA. From \"Through the Looking Glass\" \"The time has come, the walrus said. To speak of many things.  Of shoes of ships and sealing wax, of cabbages and kings.\"   Man, that brings back memories.", "INFO: Did they ask you to be responsible for him?", "Eh, he's 13, not 3.
