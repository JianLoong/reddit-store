If the internet is that important she can get internet herself.\n\nShe would have saved more money long term not being so ungrateful.", "NTA\n\nPersonally I don\u2019t think so. It doesn\u2019t cost her anything extra to share her streaming services but it\u2019s costs you extra for fibre or food", "INFO: Did you try having a conversation?", "NTA. If she wants internet she can pay for it herself. Also, telling you that you need to ask permission to use her services is kind of dumb. She didn't ask to put them on the TV, did she?", "NTA.  I will admit that I probably would\u2019ve done the exact same as you if one of my boys did the same to me.", "Using and making a profile on someone else\u2019s streaming service isn\u2019t great. However, it\u2019s your internet and your TV. \n\nAt the worst case, she should\u2019ve told the OP off for doing something on her account without her permission - and then, if OP says \u201cremove my profiles\u201d, should\u2019ve said something like - \u201cyou can use the profiles - I would just like you to ask next time you change my accounts or do something like that\u201d.\n\nBut both she and OP didn\u2019t communicate well and I was kinda feeling a little like ESH. \n\nHowever, she lives there rent-free and eats your food mostly (meaning, in my mind, she is *supposed* to be paying for her own food). So, she is now in the \u201cfind out\u201d stage of being selfish. \n\nFinal verdict is NTA. But you need to have a sit down with Paige and set the rules for living there. Maybe it includes a nominal cost for utilities/rent - maybe is sets rules around food purchases. \n\nBut, whatever rules you both agree to - the main point would be not playing the home edition of passive aggressive malicious compliance. \n\nYou need to communicate better and make sure there are well understood consequences for antisocial types of behaviors.", "ESH.\n\nY'all should try conversing like adults.\n\nOne, Paige should have talked to you about adding the streaming services since you bought the TV and it was running off the Internet.\n\nTwo, you should have talked to her about using them since she I assume pays for those.\n\nInstead of hashing this out further, you cut the Internet without discussing.\n\nThis sounds like a needlessly hostile environment that both of you are contributing to, but I would put more of the onus on you since ultimately you need to lay out your expectations for living rent-free in the house, house rules, etc. to help your daughter get back on the college track. You are the more knowing adult in this, act like it.", "NTA -Too bad you never taught her how to share. Your daughter is being very shortsighted-free rent and some groceries-she\u2019s biting the hand that feeds her.", "NTA. Tell her to pay for the internet since she can afford all those streaming apps.", "INFO: Did you tell her you were going to do this before you did it? I don't think you are TA by any means but I wonder if this drama could just be avoided by better communication between you two?", "ESH Why would you not communicate these things with her before hand. Yes it was rude of her to not share when you are doing so much for her, but the real asshole move here is not trying to work out the issue at all and blindsiding her by canceling internet without warning or giving her a chance to compromise/figure something out.", "ESH and as per usual a little communication. could have avoid all the drama", ">I'm letting her live with me for free and she eats my groceries a lot of the time\n\nINFO: Was this agreed upon before she moved in ?", "NTA", "ESH\n\nYour post as well as comments read like those of a teenager. I can see where your daughter got her communication and conflict management skills from.", "ESH.\n\nDepending on your relationship, you should have asked to create a profile before just using her services. Yeah, of course she should share her services with you, but you could have easily asked before just assuming. When she called you out on it, you could have just apologised and asked then, but you over-reacted and cut off your nose to spite your face. \n\nCancelling the internet was pure spite, which seems to be the main theme with you in this story.", "ESH.  \n\nYour daughter being annoyed at you is stupid, but you could have told her that she needs to pay for the internet if she wants to continue having sole use of her streaming services.\n\nAlso, correct me if I'm wrong, but is there any point having a Smart TV if you don't have the internet?", "You\u2019re not legally/morally wrong, just very childish.", "ESH - Both of you are adults and neither of you acts like it.\n\nThis is the type of problem that a calm, respectful conversation could have solved.\n\nThere are going to be lots of people telling you you were \"right\", but your enjoyment of being \"right\" is going to come at a cost to your peace.", "NTA\n\nShe sounds spoiled.", "Nta!

Said \"OK sorry\" then skulked off to slowly and secretly turn off the internet?\n\nDid your wife also yell at you a lot? Could you be taking that shit out on her a little? What you did was passive-aggressive. I personally try not to operate that way. Other people don't respect it in general. Say what you mean and say it mean. If you have to.\n\nI'm leaning more toward ESH now.", "NTA but she shouldn't have yelled at you for making a profile. She made a choice and will learn.", "NTA but you might have been in an easier situation if you pointed out all you do for her and then suggesting you\u2019d cut the service. She might have had a reality check and relented. As someone who lived with my parents for a couple years to save up, she\u2019s outrageously selfish. I would go out of my way to make it up to my folks.", "NTA", "NTA. \n\nI did a similar thing, someone was using my PS4 to access Netflix, I watched it one morning, they found out and chucked a hissy fit.

You could have just cancelled the cable part. I suspect that her \u201cyelling\u201d might not have been yelling, just annoyance. Because streaming services restrict how many screens a person can watch on, so you might have been stopping her from watching stuff. Which you would have known if you asked first.

Your TV?", "Which as the commenter above points out, could have been solved with a conversation.

She's basically living for free so she can't really complain if any of these free amenities were to disappear anytime.\n\nThat being said, what you did was a dick move. Following this debacle, perhaps having an agreed upon cost sharing for certain items might help.", "So, by your logic he didn\u2019t need to ask to use her streaming services, right?", "First of all, a TV is more like an appliance. Would she have to ask to use the stove when she lives there?  \nAnd no, I don't think he should have to ask to use the streaming service she installed in the household appliance.
