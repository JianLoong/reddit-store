He asked if he was an AH.\n\nRead the FAQ. \"[Justified AH](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq/#wiki_can_we_add_.201Cjustified_asshole.201D_or_.201Cjust_an_honest_mistake.201D_or_another_judgment_idea_that_i_have.3F)\" still makes OP an AH.", "His* TV.", "Not even family. When we had a smart TV (stopped buying them after our kids broke the second one and just brought a chromecast to stream) and a couple of hubby's mates were living with us, anyone with access to the TV got a profile (it's still there but now it's just \"guest\"). It doesn't cost extra and it saves people messing with our preferences (plus the kids have their own profile too).", "And isn\u2019t paying rent", "No but on a plan for one screen, two people in a house using it gets annoying. In a three person house we did actually have people watching all 4 at once. Being passive aggressive makes you look like a child by the way. If you didn\u2019t like my comment, you didn\u2019t have to open your mouth and prove I was right about you being a condescending jerk \ud83d\ude02", "Dude you're so whiny.", "If you don't want people to call you out for being an asshole don't post on AITAH lmao (YTA btw)", "When she moves out.", ">She lives under his roof for free\n\nThat\u2019s his daughter, why should she pay for rent", "Something doesn't add up here. Why would you take the time to create profiles on four different apps if you only watch 30 minutes of TV per day?\n\nUnless you were marking your territory.\n\nIt would take me hours to figure out how to create profiles for myself on four different streaming apps.", "I don\u2019t think personal accounts for services she pays for count as community things.", "No she doesn't. But if I find apps on my tv I should have access.", "But OP needs to ask to use the apps? On that TV? How is that costing the daughter any extra?", "Well OP did say they didn\u2019t want to mess up the daughter\u2019s preferences and tv shows, so they made another profile on the account to try out the services without altering the daughter\u2019s profile.", "Creating profiles takes like 2 minutes, they\u2019re not difficult, especially on the apps OP listed.\n\nFirst thing that shows up when you open the app is \u201cWho\u2019s Watching?\u201d with a + icon to add a new profile. Which is usually just the name and an icon, maybe rating limit if it\u2019s a kid profile.", "I agree. I don't understand how someone installs Netflix on someone else's TV... The house TV... And then gets pissed when someone uses it...", "Absolutely agree he should not have to ask. I can't even imagine installing an app on a shared TV and being remotely bothered by this. He even created his own profile to not see or mess with her history.", "Creating a profile takes longer, at least for me, than the simple act of hitting a plus sign and typing a profile name.\n\nSelecting an avatar and setting a PIN or password takes me a lot longer than 2 minutes. For me to subject myself to that four times in a row would take a lot of motivation. And I would presumably spend at least some time browsing the available content to see if there's anything I would be interested in watching in the first place.", "Right? Like it's literally his TV but he's not allowed to use it. Fuck all of that.", "TIL lots of people are wildly sensitive about their streaming accounts.", "Streaming service profiles don't require internal PINs or passwords, there's one overall login and then the profiles are just different queues. So all you do is hit plus, enter a name and, optionally, select an avatar. it really is a very fast one-time process.", "If you care about the avatar I can see that, but I usually just do a quick glance at the available avatars and select a random one. Same for PIN, most of my services I don\u2019t utilize them, as I know every device I have them logged into. (Honestly can\u2019t even think of one that allows profile PINs, other than fire stick.) \n\nAs for content, half of the services I currently own I started using because there was a show/movie that I wanted to watch and it\u2019s only on a specific service.", "I'll have to take your word for that.\n\nI still can't picture me expending the effort to do that four times in one sitting unless I was being a petty AH toward someone."]}
