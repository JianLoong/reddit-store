I was surprised once by my cousin's wife, but that was because we're three houses away, she knew us pretty well at that point, due to proximity we were going to be the go-to babysitters in spite of there being closer relatives biologically and - most importantly - she had a super easy delivery.

She won't ever be able to truly relax in her own home while in recovery, even if she's not actively hosting, I can almost guarantee she will be mentally hosting which will add stress and slow recovery.\n\n\nLet me repeat.

This is not the time to be hosting family, it\u2019s time for your husband to care for you and your child. Time for you both to adjust to the change of having a child. \n\nStick to your decision OP. Wish you and baby a safe delivery.", "NTA. There are a boat load of kids getting sick right now and medication shortages in some areas. No way would I allow 3 people to get off a plane full of germs and come near my vulnerable newborn.", "NTA who is going to cook for and clean up after these people", "International relatives who are inconsiderate/oblivious enough to invite themselves over 1 month after you give birth - what could go wrong?  \nSomething tells me they'd NOT be helping but instead would start complaining that you're a bad host, making messes and in general making your life a living hell while your husband sides with them and accuses you of hating his family. All this done with him as the interpreter because you don't share a common language.  \n\n\nAnd the fact he said \"it's my child too and it's tough for me\" LOLLL oh man I really hope this isn't a sign of your future raising a kid with this man and he's just having a moment...because it's not looking bright :(  \n\n\nAll the best with your baby and NTA", "NTA Hotel visit is perfectly reasonable. You really need to sit your husband down and explain what all is going to be going on after you give birth, I'm hoping he just isn't getting it. Your gonna need a good bit of time alone to get recentered and it's best for you both and the baby to have a bit of alone bonding time. \n\n You're gonna be healing for a while and not be able to cook or clean to well much less host anyone, and most men don't do hosting duties :/. Plus I wanna say I'v heard when your first starting to breast feed you have to do it a lot and sometimes wearing tops becomes an issue.   \n Your also gonna both be sleep deprived.", "This. I spent the entire time in the hospital half naked in postpartum undies. I did not want anyone else there except for my husband. When we got home, I wanted my best friend for an hour max, and I wanted my mom. My dad was ok, but only because I don\u2019t care about plopping my boob out in front of him. The two times my in laws visited in the two months since his birth were so stressful, even with my mom running around to cook and clean, and I had to go feed the baby in his nursery because he got so freaked out trying to eat in front of some people he didn\u2019t know (and it was awkward for me despite a month of practice and a nursing shirt). Do not have anyone in your home you do not feel comfortable literally wiping your butt or cleaning up blood. Do not have anyone who won\u2019t cook and clean and hold the baby in the middle of the night when you want to rest if you end up with a contact sleeper. Do not have anyone there you don\u2019t know super well and certainly not someone you can\u2019t communicate with and will have a huge cultural gap with. Just no. NTA.", "We just had it and, even as adults, it took THREE WEEKS to recover. I was more exhausted than any flu or bug I\u2019ve ever had with the exception of pneumonia. Just the risk of disease alone should be enough to cancel this plan. Why do husbands see labor as a spectator sport that\u2019s followed by a 6 week tailgating party at home? Just why? NTA, OP. If necessary, tell your husband he\u2019s welcome to go see mommy and daddy at their house.", "This. I'm Venezuelan and we tend to group around and care for new moms, do chores, cook. I would be devastated not getting to know my son or brother's baby soon after birth.", "I think couples from different cultures and backgrounds should talk about this things before crap happens... I get it op is the one physically having the baby but is his husbands child too.", "It baffles me how they seem to   collectively hate extended family. Especially husbands side and MIL.", "They absolutely should talk about it. But it's simply not ok to intrude on someone's recovery from childbirth. Doesn't seem that she has a relationship with these people that would make this helpful or comforting to her. It's not just language either: it's not clear that either side has made any effort here. \n\nI get that it's his kid too but it's her medical procedure. \n\nETA; they aren't assholes for asking for sure. This situation calls for compromise. Also note that this is a terrible time, given the current RSV/flu outbreak, to have a newborn around a bunch of people"]}
