Your brother's kids don't need a lot of clothing, a pair of shorts would be enough.  Given how they have been raised (apparently broke single father) it's easy to see how they could be oblivious and need some work to get used to differences in the households.  That can be accomplished casually without  confrontation. \n\nOTOH, I think that you are a bit over the top here.   So what if they occasionally go out in the backyard naked?  The boys are not \"inappropriate\", it's just different from what you were raised with.  And tbh, I think it's probably better for your 10 year-old to see her cousins now than in 5+ years.
