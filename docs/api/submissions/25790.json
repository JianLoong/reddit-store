They need to follow the rules.", "NTA.\n\nI was prepared for you to be some extreme conservative person, saying they can't go around shirtless.\n\nBut completely naked in someone else's home at their ages? Nope, nope, nope.", "NTA. Your brother is being immature.  His arguments that they're just being kids and doing what they want are evidence of his lousy parenting skills.  A possible compromise could be  to tell your nephews they can hang out in the privacy of their bedroom if they want to \"play nudist camp\" but once they come out into the rest of the house, and certainly the yard, it's time for clothes ON.", "Do these children wear clothes in public?

You need to do what you need to do to feel comfortable about the situation and your standing in the neighborhood.", "NTA, would he rather them not wear clothes on the street while living out of their car?  Because that's where they would be if it was me and was pulling this crap.", "NTA, The fact that your brother is giving you the cold shoulder in your house?  I wouldn't tolerate that. \n\nAt that age the kids should be wearing pants, not running naked, they are not 3 years old. \n\nYour brother needs an expiry date on how long he is living there, or you will be posting again in 6 months or a year,   if it's your fault that your nephews are homeless.", "NTA", "Nta \nThey should've at least had underwear on", "NTA at 5 & 6 years old both of these boys are in school & are more than old enough to know that people don\u2019t just run around naked.", "NTA.

Wearing clothes is one of those rules unless, you live in a nudist colony.", "NTA, just as your husband told him, your house your rules.\n\nIf he is upset about that, then he should look for another place for him and his kids to live...", "NTA. They are not toddlers who are taking their diapers off and running around. They are old enough to understand why this isn't appropriate and your brother just seems lazy or like he doesn't want to have to deal with them and a potential tantrum. Also, your poor daughter must be so uncomfortable. If it's really a big deal, maybe compromise with suggesting they at least wear underwear around the house? Either way, NTA - your brother is though.", "NTA, if for no other reason... Your daughter!

He probably feels pretty shitty his life is in a rework phase. Just be patient, lead with love. \ud83d\udc9e time heals all. \n\nUse this as a teaching opportunity for your daughter. The human body is nothing to be ashamed of. Boys have penises, they all do. Teach her how to respect her and her cousins bodies. It\u2019s very natural.", "**ESH**   I'm honestly surprised at how this could have become a big issue.  There is a difference between perspectives on nudity within the family that needs resolution.   Your brother's kids don't need a lot of clothing, a pair of shorts would be enough.  Given how they have been raised (apparently broke single father) it's easy to see how they could be oblivious and need some work to get used to differences in the households.  That can be accomplished casually without  confrontation. \n\nOTOH, I think that you are a bit over the top here.   So what if they occasionally go out in the backyard naked?  The boys are not \"inappropriate\", it's just different from what you were raised with.  And tbh, I think it's probably better for your 10 year-old to see her cousins now than in 5+ years.  If she is embarrassed about it, it's most likely because she's picked up on *your* judgemental discomfort.  \n\nTalk to your brother in a non-judgemental way and ease the kids into some shorts.", "YTA, Nudity is natural. Get used to it.", "YTA\n\nThey are kids. What is innapropriate about it? They are 6 yo.\n\nYou can ask them to make sure to out some underwear, just to make sure any extra drop of pee doesn't fall on the floor or furniture and stuff like that.

Try to see him not as your baby brother, but as a man who uses abusive and manipulative measures to gloss over and distract from his failures.

Why is your brother teaching your nephews that public nudity is okay? I am a man who has three younger brothers. We didn't do that. That's ridiculous. Good on your husband for not throwing you under the bus. That's how a real man takes care of his wife and home. You're better than I am. For one, I would have sat all three of them down, and right in front of my brother, I would have told my nephews that they have to wear clothes. I wouldn't have asked him.

This is your house and your rules. Your brother is probably feeling really sensitive right now because he can\u2019t provide his sons with a home that they can fully be themselves in and his reaction is probably much more about that than anything else. It\u2019s difficult to not have a space that belongs to you where you make all of the rules and I\u2019m sure that\u2019s mostly what is going on here.

Cause most, if not all, of us understand how 6/7yo boys can be when it comes to hygiene. LOL", "Yes it would make me feel uncomfortable to have that near my daughters.  Even they will have shorts and a tank top on", "I agree that OP is NTA and the request that the children wear clothes is perfectly reasonable; but don't you think it's a bit of a stretch to jump straight to 'this guy has lousy parenting skills' from this one thing? Granted that age is a bit old for kids to be naked as culturally normative in the U.S. (where I assume this is, I suppose without any basis); but it's not clearly neglectful if they're in a safe environment.", "Excuse me?   You think a 10-year old is going to be traumatized by seeing 6-year old naked.   If any trauma occurs, it will be because of her mother's making such a big deal out it.

The most she'll see is \"huh, boys have something between their legs that I don't\", which, tbh, ought not to be a huge or traumatic surprise.\n\nThat said, OP and husband are completely within their rights to insist that they do wear clothes. I'm just saying that I don't think any real harm is done by them not doing so.", "That\u2019s ridiculous they\u2019re so young. It\u2019s nothing to see boys that age naked.

We have a garden away from our house where we\u2019re also okay with it (it\u2019s quite normal there for kids, including girls, to wear just swimming pants).\n\nAnd we taught here that everywhere else you wear clothes. \n\nI personally probably wouldn\u2019t mind the 2 kids being naked, because they live there and at home, I really don\u2019t care. But I don\u2019t know how open the garden is to people looking in, I\u2019m in the Netherlands and our norms about being naked might differ, and they\u2019re not in my house. \nIt\u2019s perfectly okay to ask them to wear something, and at 6 and 7 they should be able to do that", "Some kids have a problem with it. My son will remove anything and everything if he can. We do draw a line at underwear though because I don't want private parts rubbing all over my couch and other furniture.", "Yep.... When she was younger she would just not wear a shirt around the house no matter what. But now that she has been going to school for her 2nd year she wears a shirt.   \nWe are in the USA and live in the USA out in the country. So she could do as your daughter does but as you said she is becoming less comfortable with it now.", "My concerns about my 4yo being naked outside are 1) several other houses have a clear view of our yard and 2) sun and insect exposure, but if we had a private outside space, some sunscreen, and it wasn\u2019t insect season, short bouts would probably be okay with even me.", "Home rule. Nothing inherently wrong with kids of a certain age not wanting to bother with clothes, and parents allowing and encouraging that within certain boundaries, until you\u2019re intruding on somebody else\u2019s peace of mind and then, just like adults who go to someone else\u2019s house, you gotta put on some pants."]}
