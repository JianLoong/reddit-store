Your brother's kids don't need a lot of clothing, a pair of shorts would be enough.  Given how they have been raised (apparently broke single father) it's easy to see how they could be oblivious and need some work to get used to differences in the households.  That can be accomplished casually without  confrontation. \n\nOTOH, I think that you are a bit over the top here.   So what if they occasionally go out in the backyard naked?  The boys are not \"inappropriate\", it's just different from what you were raised with.  And tbh, I think it's probably better for your 10 year-old to see her cousins now than in 5+ years.

And I make my kids wear clothes.", "NTA - They are old enough to know they need to wear clothes.", "NTA", "NTA he's asking for something potentially bad to happen depending on the area he lives in and beyond that it is wildly inappropriate.", "You are NTA, you did your job to protect your daughter, and if you brother cant even respect such a simple rule, its gonna be very soon that he becomes homeless again.  \n\n\nHe has a responsibility to take up the father role and make sure those boys are not homeless and understands he has to sacrifice some of his \"freedom\" if he is under someone's roof", "NTA Your house, your rules. If he doesn't like it, he is free to find somewhere else to stay. 6 and 7 is way too old to be running around naked.", "NTA. I get it, you don\u2019t want to make them feel bad about not wearing clothes but this is your house, and they have to abide by your rules. It sounds pretty disgusting to have to deal with them naked in your house.", "NTA, my kid is 5 and he\u2019s allow to free range pee at our house in the back yard. The key to that is no one can see in our backyard, so when we go over my parents\u2019 house I have to remind him that the same rules do not apply when anyone walking down the street can see him.", "Your brother needs to be a bit more grateful for this situation. You opened up your home to him and his boys. \nHaving some house rules is and should be fine. \nYou don't want to see your nephews naked, that's a fair rule. A compromise could be they just wear swimming shorts or normal shorts. So they can still stay cool. \nYour brother is being unreasonable for first wanting to \"go over you\" to talk to your husband, devaluing your stance and secondly, his current behaviour around you, acting out like a child. \nI think a mediation is needed to discuss the feelings that are being left unsaid.", "NTA\n\nYour house. Also, being naked outside is not a good idea.", "Letting kids roam around naked is very irresponsible. What if there's an emergency where everyone needs to run out of the house (fire, gas leak, etc) at the drop of a hat? It takes more time to get dressed and then drop the hat.\n\nPlus, it's wholly rude for your brother to decide that's okay when it's not even his own house.\n\nNTA, at all.", "NTA but then again what did you expect to happen the bil would now be gracious around you. You stepped on his toes is he being short and quiet or is he being rude and hateful if not the 2nd of the two then live your life and don't expect the world to like you.", "NTA\u2026. With a 10yr old daughter in the house? I\u2019m sure it makes her very uncomfortable, too. I\u2019d be all over this, and they\u2019d shape up or ship out: I\u2019m very protective of my children. I even struggle with it as they\u2019re becoming late teens. But IMO, it is NOT appropriate for children of that age to be running around nude around a little girl. Bunch of guys? It\u2019s funny and comfortable. College dorms and locker rooms, no fucks given\u2026. Significant other? NotaProblum\u2026 kids that are not your own? Not all right\u2026 again, MY OPINION.", "NTA, both of my kids were wearing clothes around company by the time that they were 2 years old.

What?\n\nNTA", "NTA why would he just let his kids at that age run around naked especially since it\u2019s not even in his house. I wouldn\u2019t want them to do that even if I didn\u2019t have a 10-year-old daughter living with me. It would be different if they were babies maybe but they are a little older than that and it is your house.", "NTA, Christ alive, does your brother not realize how creepy he comes off letting his kids freeball it at that age? Especially outside, good lord.", "I want bums covered before they sit on my couch NTA", "NTA.  How could you possibly be the asshole in this situation?  Nobody wants to see naked kids walking around their house, much less your daughter.  If your brother doesn't like it he can go somewhere else.  Also, it's beyond disrespectful to go around you and talk to your husband, \"man to man.\"", "NTA. They are in your home and this is a very reasonable request, especially when I compare it to other things I've read here.", "They can be naked in their bedroom and in the bathroom. Anywhere else, they need to wear clothes.", "Wow! It\u2019s more than your house your rules. It\u2019s about respect. You told your brother that his kids near to wear clothes in your house. Instead of respecting what you said he decided to \u201cgo over your head\u201d and speak to your husband as if a. He runs the house and b. He would really side with him.\nYour husband checked him and now he has an attitude with you. He needs to respect you or GTFO.  He also should be teaching his kids to have respect for other people. \n\nYour brother and his kids would be homeless If it wasn\u2019t for you and he has the gall to walk around with his ass on his shoulders. Again he can pack his shit and GTFO.\n\nDoes he have a job? Is he contributing to expenses? He needs to actively looking for a place and needs a firm move out date. This should be in writing.", "NTA, 6 and 7 is way too old for that. \n\n>He then went and talked to my husband \"man to man\"\n\nWtf, how would that fucking change anything? Your brother sounds like a misogynistic prick. The fact that he's sulking about it is just gross.", "NTA-at least a pair of underwear. No one wants bare butts on their furniture. Also, it\u2019s your house and if you don\u2019t want people walking around naked then they need to respect that. It\u2019s one reasonable ask to be allowed to live in your home.", "So wait...you brother went behind you back to recruit you husband against you?  He's a shit.  But cograts to you husband for having you back.", "NTA You may want to consider with the rules, a time limit they can stay, and even get it in writing.  Otherwise, you may have a freeloader for a very long time, and will have trouble getting them out.", "Nta. My kids know they can be naked in their rooms and in the bathroom, but generally we all need to wear clothes in the common spaces.", "NTA - Your house, your rules....and you have a 10 yr old daughter. Those boys wandering around naked is inappropriate. Nothing wrong with those boys wearing at least a pair of swimtrunks.", "NTA. If they're walking around the house naked and someone sees that through a window, or if they're doing so in your backyard as you said, be ready for CPS to get called cause they're gonna get the wrong idea. This is for your safety as much as his and his kids.", "NTA. A couple kids running their home naked is not that big a deal but it is not their home it'a your home. Your home, your rules. Besides, at 7 it is time to start grasping modesty.", "You are absolutely correct, it's your house. When he gets his own place, he can do what he wants. They really shouldn't be doing that at their age. If your brother pulls that crap again, tell him they need to leave!!!!", "NTA you need to install appropriate social boundaries at some point. Little boys are going to encounter a lifetime of difficulty if they don't learn how to be appropriate with their bodies.", "No", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t need anyone\u2019s butts or balls on my furniture. Regardless of age! I thinking throwing on underwear or shorts is reasonable.  No need for a full outfit, but they can still be kids without leaving streak marks on the sofa", "NTA\n\nTell him the child is him and your husband is 100% correct. Your house your rules. If you had been okay with nudity and walked around naked he would have to adapt to that too. You are giving him and his 2 kids housing the least he can do is follow the rules of your home. As an alternative the kids can run around in swimsuits and those sleeves shirts if its so hot but fully naked is clearly against the boundary and he has to respect that.", "WTF NTA. Those kids are way too old for that. BIL should have taught them years ago that private parts are private, and it's wrong to make other people see your junk. He's angry because he knows he screwed up.", "NTA.  Your brother doesn't seem to be at all grateful of you and your husband's hospitality.  Being clothed is just the appropriate thing to be.", "NTA... They are old enough to wear cloths. Hygiene is one reason.", "NTA purely because its your house. If you walked into their house and complained, then it would be a different situation, but imo its not exactly a strict rule to be following", "NTA and yes, your asks are completely appropriate. Your brother being so disrespectful of you isn't. I  understand he just lost his home and independence and has to be mad at someone, but you're not the one he should take this out on. \n\nIf he can't redirect his anger to something more appropriate in the future, he should find someone else to live with. And be careful with your daughter. His sons haven't had much discipline and they may not be able to be alone with your daughter without getting inappropriately curious about her body.", "NTA.  Your house, your rules.  LOVE that your husband supported the choice. \n\nBro & kids can live elsewhere if they don't like it.  And when he gets his house he can even make the rules!", "NTA, previous comments have covered why", "This is extremely inappropriate", "YTA you're a prude and your trying to force those kids to be prudes too. You having a daughter that you probably also managed to force into being a prude has nothing to do with this.", "The first time someone sees those kids running around naked CPS will be on your door step. NTA and make sure he understands that if he wants to keep his kids.", "NTA\n\nSingle dad here. Your brother isn't doing his kids any favours. It is expected to be clothed in life. If they are getting ready to take a bath or just got out of the bath, I could understand, but after a few minutes you'd be like ok, get in the bath, or get dressed. It's hot, they can take their shirt off, or find more appropriate ways to cool off. As the dad he needs to teach them not just the rules he agrees with, but the rules of common decency everyone expects or his kids will get judged in life until they learn themselves.\n\nThat is ignoring the other lessons here; when in someone else's house, you need to respect their rules. When someone is doing you a favour, don't sulk about it. Your brother is wildly TA here, and not being a good parent.", "Bro is damn near homeless and you\u2019re allowing him and his family to stay in your house. He should go get his own spot if he can\u2019t live by your rules.", "Nta at all. \n\nThere could be legal repercussions for allowing that to happen, it really is asking for trouble So no nta, besides they should know better they are not babies", "NTA, but I think there's another framing that needs to be given as a teaching moment to the nephews. Not everyone is comfortable about being around naked people. There should be an age appropriate conversation about people consenting to having you expose your genitals to them. And when things are a little less raw with your brother, a conversation about teaching his kids social norms. \n\nSo basically all the stuff you told him, but spelling out what you mean by appropriate.", "My little brother was a really rambunctious kid and still is. When he was 1-3 we\u2019d let him run around naked occasionally and he\u2019d be goofy about it. Sometimes he\u2019d stand on the back porch butt ass naked and just be pissing off the step with his hands behind his back and his bare cheeks pressed up against the glass door. It was funny. We lived in the middle of no where and had no neighbors.\n\nBut around age 4 we started teaching him to keep at least bottoms on all the time. When he peed outside he had to go behind a bush. Of course he\u2019d sit on his iPad in his undies at night but we never let him run around streaking.", "Especially if OP has a 10 year old daughter fuck the fact that it\u2019s not there actual house. there\u2019s a young lady in the house the boys shouldn\u2019t be running around naked period.", "Or just a pig", "I don't put up with busshit like cold shoulders and silent treatments anywhere never mind my own house", "No?", "No, She relayed her discomfort that she felt in her own home and brother decided to act like an ass.\n\nYes bodies are natural and no one should be ashamed to have one, but so is wanting to not feel discomfort in one\u2019s own home.", "So is uranium, I dont see you getting used to that", "all children in general are terrible at wiping boys and girls", "come on bro they're not even preteens about to hit puberty, they're little kids. they have no concept of sexuality or perversion at those ages, if they've had a normal brain development and upbringing so far. the girl will be fine, the boys will be fine, treat bodies like bodies and not sexual objects to be ashamed of.", "I love how the last thread on this topic had a 10 year old girl running around naked and everyone was like \"she shouldn't be ashamed of her body!!121!212!!1!!\"", "Why? Will she go blind? It's just young boys.", "It's not neglectful but it is lazy to pull the boys will he boys and I can't control them card", "No - the \"kids will be kids and do what they want\" attitude is totally a marker of lousy parenting skills.", "I'm not saying that the boys shouldn't conform to the norms of the household, I'm saying the OP's judgemental approach is counterproductive.   Also, the boys have no home but this one right now.", "After just doing my 7-year-old stepdaughter's laundry for 2 weeks in a row, I can absolutely confirm that!", "Plenty of adults are too. I know a woman who has gone 20+ years without knowing you\u2019re supposed to wipe front-to-back if you have a vag. \n\nShe saw a video online of somebody joking about women having to wipe that way, thought it was a weird troll or something. Sent it to me. I told her it\u2019s not a joke, we all wipe like that, do you not? She said no, that she\u2019d never heard that \u201cold wive\u2019s tale\u201d before.", "my 5 year old will wear sleeveless and underwear at home but if company comes over she runs to her room like Usain Bolt and puts on shorts real fast", "Well I did say in my other message that they should be in shorts.  I'm focused on the way the OP is handling this.", "my nieces- or rather one niece- was the same at that age. she wanted to be naked sometimes. and there was an explanation of when and where it was appropriate.\n\ncuz yeah, when she was like 3 and we were in a park in NYC, I turned around to help her sister take off her dress so they could run thru the water area (it's not crazy in NYC for kids to run thru in minimal clothing if they don't have swim gear)- she had stripped naked in like 5 seconds. After I stopped laughing, I did get her into an appropriate level of clothing.\n\nbut omg kids."]}
