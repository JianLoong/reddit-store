Your brother's kids don't need a lot of clothing, a pair of shorts would be enough.  Given how they have been raised (apparently broke single father) it's easy to see how they could be oblivious and need some work to get used to differences in the households.  That can be accomplished casually without  confrontation. \n\nOTOH, I think that you are a bit over the top here.   So what if they occasionally go out in the backyard naked?  The boys are not \"inappropriate\", it's just different from what you were raised with.  And tbh, I think it's probably better for your 10 year-old to see her cousins now than in 5+ years.

I was born in the last millennium and we still had sex ed that discussed this by 4th grade, which was age 9 for most kids. And this was only if the parents didn't teach them outside of school/they did any sort of farm or animal work/they didn't have siblings of the other sex.\n\nWhile in my culture nudity is not the norm, and definitely would be weird to have naked guests in the house, the idea that it would be an introduction to biology blows my mind.", "If you believe have had a very limited life.   I know plenty of girls that age who would not be phased at all.   And the fact that they are cousins would make it more natural.", "The distance from the butthole is the same. This is what I\u2019m not getting. You know you don\u2019t have to pull forward, right? You can just go down.  No poop is ever touching or near the vulva.", "It doesn\u2019t have to be poop or poop flakes. It has to do with the bacteria in that area period, lol. You don\u2019t even had to have gone poop; even if you\u2019re just peeing, you should be wiping front-to-back. \n\nI don\u2019t know how else to explain this because I\u2019m not a doctor or anything, but it is strongly advised you do not start from the back because of the germs present in that area. They can get on the paper towel and be dragged across your urethra. Boom, UTI. You start from the front where those germs are not. You don\u2019t have to stick the toilet paper on your direct butthole to get bacteria on it. \n\nI\u2019ve been taught this since I was small. My mother taught me the proper way to wipe myself, and my youngest sister when she was in diapers. Most people know this. Some do not.\n\nSure you might not get a UTI every time if you\u2019re getting lucky with it. Still wouldn\u2019t want to put my urethra in the line of fire like that personally", "YTA - it is odd to sexualise such young children. Let them be kids for gods sake.\n\nEDIT : Blimey just seen all the comments, is this a USA thing? I don't think you'd find cultures outside of the USA or other very religious societies insisting pre-pubescent children be clothed.", "YTA.\n\nTell me you're from the US without telling me you're from the US.

Then yes. Clothe your kids. But I would love for you to ask yourself what is so inappropriate about kids running around naked in their current home? They are NOT sexual beings they're kids. If they are going around peeing on things and wiping their butt on the furniture okay fine. But it's just hot. I'd wear underwear for my own protection but how serious is this really?", "If there was ever a hill to not die on, it's not whether or not your kids should be running around naked. Like holy hell I haven't been naked in front of any of my family basically since I started school. I've never met a 7 year old in my entire life that would willingly run outside naked, even less so an adult who would be cool with it, go as far to get angry when he's called out for it. Maybe it's a culture thing, but that's just weird man.", "What the actual f**k? It\u2019s not not not appropriate for a 10yr old girl to be subjected to naked little boys!

I got so tired of seeing his ass. My other cousin that\u2019s the same age was also a girl, and we were over seeing him without pants. So I just started smacking it with whatever I could find. He stopped.", "No, America is not ok, and yes, the target audience is skewing the numbers.", "Definitely not.

Germs.  Most farm animals aren't sitting around your house (and dogs and cats are pretty good at cleaning themselves).\n2. We are people and we have societal expectations.

Do you teach them to take baths, wash their hands, brush their hair?  Animals don't do these things.", "I stopped in at my aunt's house and my baby cousin, her granddaughter, ran up to me buck ass naked.

A girl my age, a boy a year older, a boy 4 years younger, and a boy 6 years younger. We moved there when I was 5, they moved away when I was 12, so I have Very Vague Memories of them only having 3 kids for a while, and of both younger kids learning to walk and toddling across the street after their sister. We modified the rules to games to be fair, things like having to tag the younger kids twice for it to count, and our parents were friends so there was a lot of back-and-forth between the houses.\n\nBoth younger boys had a clothes-hating stage. I didn't like it. I didn't wanna see it. Neither did my sister. My friend shrugged, and my parents gave me a talking-to. If I visited their house, the boys could wear whatever they wanted and I needed to keep my mouth shut, but if they wanted to come over to our place they needed clothing. It ended about when they were 4 and starting school, for both of them, but ten-year-olds have Very Established Norms of what is and isn't okay and Clothing Around Others is one of them. \n\nSo from the perspective of someone who went through it, did it harm me? No. Was I uncomfortable and try to avoid being around them until they outgrew it? Absolutely.", "Be that as it may, it does not mean that the daughter should be forced to see her cousins naked around her home and her uncle needs to respect his sister and brother-in-law\u2019s decision and cloth his sons.

It's the adults that have a problem. It's their house - It's 100% their choice! No question about that. Personally I wouldn't have a problem with it. It's kids.
