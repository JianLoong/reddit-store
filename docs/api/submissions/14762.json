They were able to rebuild their relationship and got on spectacularly well, while I was left outside. You'd envy them if you could see them; they're like brothers, they're like best friends. I admit this may have left me with some bitterness and may have influenced my decision.\n\nTwo years ago I met the love of my life and we agreed to tie the knot just recently. I asked my Mom if she could walk me.\n\nYou should've seen the look on her face. Pure joy, she was over the moon. I know Mom has her fair share of low self-esteem and doubt, so clearly this request made her feel very special.\n\nNews broke out, the family heard of it. Aunts and grandmas who never gave me the time of the day are suddenly very invested in our wedding and very angry with me. Uncles and grandpas who always ignored me suddenly called to tell me they were very disappointed in me. \n\nThe pressure has made Mom tell me sadly she doesn't want to walk me anymore, and I know she's only saying that because they're mad. \n\nAn aunt told me regardless of how I feel about my father, nothing takes away the fact that he is my father and the honor of walking me belongs to him. He may not have been perfect, but he stuck around when he could and provided for me, that's far more than my own good for nothing father ever did.\n\nI see her point, and coupled with the fact that Mom has pulled out I almost changed my mind.

Or did he actually not care and you're just being outraged for no reason?\"", "NTA at all sweetie. \n\nI had a verrrrry similar situation (I'm not adopted, but just similar in regards to your wedding sitch\"\n\nMy dad, all my life was my best friend, rather than my dad. I called him for advice, to cry, to tell news to, anything - because he didn't judge me, just helped. \n\nHowever, he and my now step mother (they were together since I was 7 when my parents divorced - I'm 31 now) were engaged for 18 years before finally marrying in 2016. \nMy step mother never liked my sister an I (dad's bio kids), she hated our existence and made it known. \nHowever, we'd been doing much better before their wedding, and really trying with one another and seemed to get along great finally! \nBut when it came time to the wedding planning, and the fact their weddings was close, my mum asked us if we were bridesmaids - I actually paused and thought \"hmm, I'm not actually sure you know!\", which she thought was weird we didn't know, as we're his kids. \nI asked dad and he said they weren't having ushers/bridesmaids etc, and wasn't a traditional wedding...\n\nYou can see where I'm going. \nOne thing, my step mum has two kids also! Similar ages to my sis and I too. \nFound out on the day, the ACTUAL DAY, that my step sister, walked down the aisle in a bridesmaids dress, flowers, the works - her son, walked her down the aisle. \nThe top table, consisted of my step siblings, dad and step mum, and also my dad's mum (not close to her at all, so she doesn't deserve me calling her grandma). \nThey did a traditional wedding, and the two daughters my dad has, who travelled all the way from one end of the UK for his wedding weekend, to be shunned on a table with friends they see twice a year...\n\n\nIt broke me. My sister and I, and both our partners left the wedding early to retire to our rooms. \n\nAfter that weekend, I was truly upset with him, and how he could treat his own daughters like that.\n\nThen, I got engaged 2018.\n\nFirst thing I did, I rang mum and I also asked her to walk me down tha aisle. Mostly due to the fact that my mum practically raised my sister and I alone most of our lives. She put herself through university as a single mother at 30, with two children under 10. And she fucking did it! \n\nShe's my hero for so many reasons. \nShe was honoured and thrilled. \n\nBut then, she would only care about \"oh I'm overweight though, and everyone will be staring at me walking you down the aisle\"... This is how narcissistic she can be. So I kept getting bad feelings, but because I was so upset with my dad, and how little we meant in his own wedding, even though all my dad would say to me growing up is \"I can't wait til your wedding day, to walk you down the aisle, to have that special father daughter dance\". And it's all I ever wanted growing up too, it's all I planned on. \n\nThe day he just assumed he'd be walking me down, and just blatantly said \"when I walk you down... Etc\" - I had to stop him and say I'd actually asked my mum. \nHe sounded hurt, but actually tried to make it ok by saying \"oh that's ok, I shouldn't have assumed, I'm so sorry\". I cried telling him why I'd made that decision, and it killed me hearing the pain and him crying in his voice. \n\nI stayed firm until about a couple months before, when mum was constantly bitching and moaning about walking me down, and always kept trying to get me to ask my dad - I finally thought, actually I will ask dad. \nMostly because he hadn't stressed me out at all during the whole year of wedding shite we had to deal with. He never pressured me, never begged me to have him do the traditions. He accepted it, that I was hurt and he didn't get a play in my wedding either. \n\nHe was over the moon, and I apologised to him for taking it away from him - because the truth was, I still only ever wanted my dad walking me down. He was always my person. \n\nAnd I'm ever so pleased I did, because I got my wish since a little girl, and so did he \u263a\ufe0f \n\nMy point is - not to choose your dad too, it's to choose your \"person\". \nThe one who has always been there for you unconditionally, your friend, your counsellor, for advice.

Did your father raise, guide and protect you? Doesn't sound like it since he was in and out of rehab for a huge part of your childhood. Was that his fault? You could argue no because addiction is a disease and people do need help. But it's not your fault either. You had zero control over your father's behavior, you were just a kid. And only you get to say whether he has made up for his absence, emotional distance, etc. Only you get to say whether your father raised, guided and protected you.\n\nToo many dads think \"giving away\" their daughters is a right they are entitled to. It isn't, it's a privilege that they have to earn from the day they become a father. Either the practice is meaningless in which case everyone can stfu because they are arguing over nothing. Or the practice is meaningful in which case everyone needs to take into account what it actually means and whether that meaning was fulfilled.\n\nIn my case my dad was absent until my midteens and left me to be raised until then by my physically and emotionally abusive mom. He was very hurt and angry that I wouldn't let him give me away. But not as hurt and angry as I was when my mom was beating on me and telling me I was stupid.

But call it like it is, a non traditional take on old patterns.", "Heheh \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01", "Or you could uninvite the vultures, fuck them and fuck your dad. Him staying with you or whatever they said is bullshit he signed on for adopting a kid he has to be there doing the bare minimum doesn\u2019t make him a hero. I\u2019d say if your mom doesn\u2019t want to walk you down then either have nobody or if you really want to get petty as your fianc\u00e9\u2019s mom or dad if they\u2019ll do it", "I'm sorry these jerks think they have any say in YOUR wedding, but since your mom is too nice to stand up for yourself, that might be a good way to go about it.\n\nAnother suggestion, your fiance's parents both walk him down the aisle, and then both your parents walk with you. A lot of weddings are doing that lately.", "Fuck the vultures. They didn\u2019t care to even stay in regular contact with you until you decided to do something they disapprove of. \n\nTradition is just peer pressure from dead people and the living people you probably don\u2019t even like.\n\nI was a bridal consultant and managed a bridal shop for years. \nNo one has ever regretted doing what they wanted and what their heart wants. Soo so many brides confided in me afterward that they wish they had held out for the color, style, cake, ceremony piece or who they really wanted to walk them down the aisle. It\u2019s a (usually) once in a lifetime moment that you WANT to share with your mother. \nAbsolutely no one gets to tell the bride she can\u2019t have what her heart wants, especially when this particular dream won\u2019t cost an extra 10k or even an extra dime.\nDad can wait for broseph to get married and ask if he can be the best man or some shit since that\u2019s the relationship he has been investing his time and energy most toward since his last rehab stay. \n\nThe grass is greener where you water. If he\u2019s ashamed of the dried brown grass on the metaphorical lawn between the two of you, maybe he should put in some real effort instead of recruiting extended family to harass you at a time when you\u2019re already stressed out.", "By \"vultures\" you mean \"uninvited guests\"?", "Screw the vultures. Having both your parents walk you down the aisle is the only reasonable idea you\u2019ve listed here. The rest are just caving to their demands. They don\u2019t have any right to run your life. Tell your mom, \u201cIt hurts me that you care more about their opinion than mine. This is my wedding, not theirs.\u201d That should help her grow a spine. And tell the rest of them to lose your number.", "Whatever you decide don't forget that your dad happily stood by while people harassed you and your mother to the point that she dropped out of something she was super happy to do. You said yourself it was pure joy, something that made her feel very special, and your dad chose not to support that.", "Thank you for your insight.\n\nI just want a day where me and those I love will be happy, and everyone else will, at the very least, not harbor any ill feelings. It's the beginning of the rest of our lives and I want it to be perfect. This is why it's important for me to come to a conclusion the family is satisfied with, one that I'm happy with. It's hard to reach that point right now.", "Your issue is your wanting to appease people that don\u2019t matter. It\u2019s okay to be selfish sometimes op. If you\u2019re trying to find a solution that works for everyone else you\u2019re only going to compromise your own happiness.", "Speaking from experience, if they aren't satisfied that you're happy nothing will make them satisfied. Don't cave! You give them an inch and they'll take a mile."]}
