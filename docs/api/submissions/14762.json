It's up to you!", "My suggestion is to say if she's not then no one is. \n\nFather may have been present and I appreciate what his done for me, but I feel closer to mum who before father's recovery and after has made me feel special. \n\nThis is my desision, if you don't like it don't come.

It\u2019s pure misogyny that dictates you or any bride has to be given away at all. \n\nYou are not anyone\u2019s property, and in 2023 we should all do better. \n\nYou can walk down the aisle with anyone of your choosing, because it\u2019s your choice.", "NTA. **Do not** let the pressure keep you from having your wish of having your mother walk your down the aisle.

I\u2019m sorry but this is just like respect, it\u2019s not given, it\u2019s earned. He did not earn that spot to walk you down the isle, your mother did.

Your extended family is evil and sexist. \n\nIf you want a compromise (not that you should) it is fairly normal to have both parents walk you.\n\nYou are not ungrateful, you just want to celebrate your amazing mom.

Your wedding, your choice. Mother, father, sister, brother, best friend, your dog - whoever walks you down the aisle is your choice and your choice alone.

It's not fair to generalize that being an only child is a reason for   \nbossy behavior, especially when there are many only children who do not   \nbehave that way. It's important to address these issues and make sure   \nthat all the children are treated equally and with respect. It's good   \nthat you spoke up about it, and it's important to continue to advocate   \nfor your children and their well-being. However, it's also important to   \nfind a way to address these issues without causing tension or conflict   \nwithin the family.", "NTA. Your choice.

Lots of people do this.", "NTA I am a marriage celebrant, and it is common to have unwanted opinions forced on you. But this is your wedding\n\nI suggest something a little different. Let your dad accompany you down the aisle  - but have a special inclusion in the ceremony that is a surprise for mum. If you look up 'Rose Ceremony', you can present mum with a rose to say thank you for everything she has done. Write your own message and either attach it to the rose for her to read privately, or you read it aloud in public when you present it to her. Your partner could also do it for their mother.\n\nIt's powerful and meaningful and will give your mother so much more that just you and her can share.", "YTA.  Might as well not invite him.  Like you said he has done nothing wrong.  Provided for you,etc.  but you're going to publicly shame him like that.  Also I get it that we're the unconventional generation, but it is a public shaming to the older generation.  A small piece of convention to adhere to.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
