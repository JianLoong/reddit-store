I'm just explaining why they had that reaction.", "In the US, it is common to offer coffee to guests. These days though, there is a substantial younger population that does not drink coffee. It\u2019s unreasonable to expect them to provide something they don\u2019t drink themselves.  Half of my relatives under 55 only drink some form of pop/soda.", "Do you have room for a French Press coffee maker? Off-duty it can sit in the fridge with water in it.\n\nAnd, oh, NTA", "My family makes coffee constantly.  I drink it regularly.  It's our drink of choice when we socialize.  But when I lived in a tiny, and I do mean tiny, apartment in college I didn't have room for a coffee maker.  So I drank instant coffee at home.  My family adjusted.  Yours can too.", "You're NTA, but maybe consider an aeropress if you prefer ending the complaints over being right. Cheap, easy, and compact.", "NTA. What\u2019s wrong with instant coffee?! (Fellow instant coffee consumer lol)", "NTA - I love coffee and drink instant coffee quite frequently. If you get a good brand it taste good. Your parents and grandma are being snobs.", "You're not running a coffee shop. They should know where the nearst one is before heading to your place. NTA.", "NTA\n\nCoffee is my life blood. My reason for hauling my lead ass out of bed in the morning. I am possessive over my beautiful machine with the insulated carafe that brews on a timer so it\u2019s hot and ready the second my tender feet hit the ground. \n\nIf someone hosting me has only instant coffee I smile and say thank you, drink it and make another cup. Your family is being rude and they are terrible guests over coffee.", "NTA, it\u2019s your space. Given how cheap they are and that you seem to regularly entertain guests I\u2019d recommend getting one anyways, but it\u2019s not worth any stress IMO.", "What lol they are unhinged NTA if they want different coffee that's fine but they can bring it with them when they visit if they want it that badly?\n\nLike if i'm visiting a friend and know that I am going to desperately want a packet of BBQ chips during the visit I will either bring it with me or go buy it while i'm there i'm not going to complain that my friend doesn't have a packet of BBQ chips for me\n\nYour family is nuts", "NTA.  It sounds like we live in the same apartment!  I bought a cute 2 cup coffee maker because I can't function until that caffeine hits the mark.  But, if I didn't have that addiction I wouldn't have one either.  I don't even have a microwave because it's just wasted space", "Let them drink tea.\n\nNTA", "This is a Seinfeld sketch", "Why would you invite a bunch of complaining cuntz to yer apartment? They want coffee- they can pick it up on the way over. Or better yet, they just stay home.", "No.  It is your apartment.", "NTA\n\nOne of my best friends has a caffeine allergy/sensitivity (it makes her violently sick), and she has only ever had instant coffee at her house. If that\u2019s not good enough, she\u2019ll offer to drive you to Starbucks or another coffee house, or grab a soda from the gas station. She doesn\u2019t want to waste her money or space on something she can\u2019t enjoy, so she doesn\u2019t, and neither should you.", "NTA I\u2019m not a coffee drinker, but I did keep a 4-cup machine in my cupboard for guests. If I knew they were coming I\u2019d also buy a small bag of grounds and keep it in the freezer. Thing is, I still make terrible coffee. When I met my husband I bought a Keurig just so I wouldn\u2019t kill him. \nI second either telling them to grab their own from a coffee shop or keeping a small French press and let them make their own.", "NTA.  I've went through the same thing with my wife's family. Neither of us did (and still don't) drink coffee.  So one Christmas, they \"gift\" us a 12 cup coffee machine for Christmas... Just so they'd have coffee available.    \n\nAfter they've left for the evening, we'd package it back up and put it into storage. We'd freeze the unused grounds until the next time we pulled out the coffee machine. A small package of coffee would last us years \ud83d\ude09.\n\nWe still have that Braun coffee maker somewhere... Still looks new.", "NTA. If you really feel like it\u2019s a big deal, get a small French press. They\u2019re inexpensive, fit easily in a cupboard and make perfectly fine coffee.", "NTA stop inviting these people over", "NTA \nBut I could suggest a pourover or a french press if you don't want something that takes up counter space.", "NTA.  Print them out a map to the nearest coffee shop and be sure to include the hours of operation.", "Info: How close is the nearest Starbucks/Dunkin/Cumbie\u2019s/whatever local coffee place to your apartment?", "NTA Go to the thrift store and get a stove top percolator. It can stay on the stove when not in use. When they come they can make the coffee. But you really don't have to do anything. They know you don't have it so they could stop and get their own.", "NTA. That\u2019s so ridiculous that they can\u2019t get it through their heads that they can\u2019t get their usual coffee at your house. \n\n*however* in case you\u2019re interested, there exists a \u201cpour over drip coffee\u201d by Melitta cone. It\u2019s the size of a coffee mug, the filters are extra small (size 2) and if you have space you could keep ground coffee in the freezer to keep it fresh between guests. (Those little bags seriously say to use within a week. Uh no.) it just sits on top of a mug and you pour boiling water over it. Honestly it\u2019s not my favourite (I prefer French press if I can\u2019t get usual drip), buts it\u2019s something? Personally I like the Nescaf\u00e9 instant coffees as their more like lattes and feel fancy.  They also don\u2019t \u201ctaste\u201d like instant coffee persay since there is so much added sugar and powdered milk. \n\nSounds like someone should be swinging by a timmies on their way to visit and just picking up a box of coffee for everyone.  It\u2019s not your job to provide literally every beverage.", "NTA. You should look at \"old fashioned\" coffee makers (the ones that look like a sand clock shaped jar) or a French press, find the most expensive one and send a group text with the product info and tell them you'll divide the amounts and accept venmo or cash. You'll either find yourself with a fancy coffee maker that takes almost no space or you'll stop gearing complaints. Either way it's a win win.", "INFO: what you owe a guest in your home is culturally determined, so you have to decide if you\u2019re meeting your culture\u2019s standards for what a host owes their guests. Your family is telling you you\u2019re not. Do you believe differently, or do you believe that there\u2019s a superior principle that no one is obligated to make provision for guests in their home at all, if the host wouldn\u2019t ask for those same provisions in reverse?\n\nYou\u2019re acting like it\u2019s unreasonable to own a coffee maker because you don\u2019t drink coffee. But the reason to own it would be to serve coffee to guests. Same reason you\u2019d keep clean towels and toilet paper in the guest bathroom even though it\u2019s not the one you use.", "NTA but if you ever want to you could probably have a French press??\nBut I don\u2019t understand people\u2019s obsession with coffee.", "NTA, it's  your apartment and your space. \n\nI would ask what instant coffee you're using, though. Folgers crystals tastes like refried butthole. If you want a good instant coffee, look for a microgrind instant coffee. Starbucks makes one that I'd argue is better than most standard drip coffee makers produce.", "NTA\n\nIt's your apartment and suitable for your needs. That's what really matters. \n\nHowever, if you want to compromise, have you looked at a personal keruig machine? They are small - enough to do a cup of coffee, I believe. Also, they can be used for hot water for hot chocolate and tea. You can use pods already filled or refillable ones. If that won't work, I think they make some French press ones that are not large. Also, there may be a solution in the camping section. That section has a lot of nifty ideas that don't take up much space. \n\nI'm not much of a coffee drinker myself due to different reasons. Even when I do - it's more sweetened coffee flavored milk per what my Mom who loved straight black coffee called it. Best of wishes to you!", "NTA. \n\n\nMy bf is a coffee snob and I don\u2019t really drink it at all. I keep coffee crystals on hand for when he stays over. \n\n\nI learned a way to make it where it\u2019s ridiculously creamy and rich, much more like a coffee shop, and now he mostly only buys the coffee crystals because he says my \u201cspecial coffee\u201d is so much better, lol. \n\n\n*(Two heaping tablespoons of coffee crystals, one teaspoon of sugar, a few drops of vanilla extract, add few tablespoons of the cream / milk / milk substitute, and whip with a whisk or a beverage frother until it becomes a smooth, velvety, even brown.

Add more cream if desired, stir gently.)*", "NTA, but a French press or moka pot doesn\u2019t take up much space and it will keep them busy for a minute. If you wanted a way for them to make coffee that doesn\u2019t take up your limited kitchen space, that is.", "This. They've probably never even tried the instant coffee OP provides. Most coffee drinkers just say it's awful out of principle. I grew up in a household with a fancy coffeemaker surrounded by coffee drinkers all around... I know what a \"good\" coffee tastes like. I still ended up using instant coffee for my daily coffee in the morning because honestly it's much less hassle than buying a machine for just me and tastes much better than some of the filter stuff. Of course as with every coffee product there's different brands and different aromas blabla... so to simply say instant coffee is bad in general is kinda pretentious.", "I am a coffee drinker and no, instant coffee is not per se bitter and nasty. You just have to pick the right brand and aroma.", "I\u2019m no longer a poor student but I still don\u2019t have a coffee maker. What can I say, I just grew a fondness for instant coffee and I don\u2019t see a need to waste counter space on a coffee maker. No one has ever complained about me not owning a coffee machine so far because they are good guests unlike OPs parents.", "You can buy coffee bags (like tea bags) that contain ground coffee."]}
