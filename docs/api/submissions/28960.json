I get your frustration and I don\u2019t even really blame you for flushing his weed but I\u2019m still going with ESH because you are enabling him and are putting your child in this situation.\n\n(Also: he got stoned while he was the only person responsible for your child at that moment. That\u2019s bad parenting).", "I'm a medical cannabis user. I don't think what you did was wrong. He is using cannabis as an escape and disregarding his duties, the cannabis is material, you and the family are not. Is he sad? As it's something i might do when I was very depressed. Just tell him how you feel about it and try to find a understanding. He is acting like a child imo but with love and time anyone can grow up.", "YTA \n\nJust because you have said it over and over doesn\u2019t give you the right to destroy his property, which is what you did.

Your complaints are reasonable, your patience is commendable however I simply don't think it is ever tenable to destroy your partner's property. I think one way you could have gone about this that is less assholey is, when you're having the convo and he's promising not to smoke everyday, get him to agree with you that you're allowed to destroy/hide his weed if he starts to do it again.", "He\u2019s probably moody and depressed because he was self medicating with the weed and now he doesn\u2019t have it.", "YTA. You can't control another person. Accept it or leave", "YTA, but both of you need to figure out a compromise.\n\nMy husband and I had to negotiate this early in our relationship. I had some trauma around weed, plus I hate the smell. We had some arguments, etc, during the \u201cnegotiation process\u201d, but we haven\u2019t had conflict about this in like 10 years. What works really well now:\n\n- He does not smoke joints in the house. Full stop. In fact, anything that would cause our home to smell like weed is off limits. I don\u2019t know much about weed, so forgive any mistakes in terminology, but he uses some kind of oil now. \n\n- I don\u2019t question nor comment on how often he smokes.\n\n- He never does it or talks about it in front of our kid.\n\nI will say, it\u2019s impossible to tell whether or not my husband has smoked. He doesn\u2019t get \u201cstoned\u201d. Not sure why that is. But it does make it much easier to be fine with daily consumption, since his smoking does not interfere in any way with our relationship, his parenting, nor his job. \n\nI recommend you unbend a bit (I know this can be hard!! It was for me) and work with him on a compromise. If he can switch to something that doesn\u2019t smell, I think that would go a long way for you.\n\nEdit: I waffled about the NAH, because it does suck to throw out someone\u2019s property. I just really relate to how deep rooted and emotional an aversion to weed can be (I\u2019m past this, but I still remember). I\u2019m switching to YTA, but a light one.", "YTA nothing he disarmed throwing away his stuff, throwing peoples things away will do nothing but anger them. No one has ever been reasoned with after someone threw their stuff away or broke their stuff. You have some valid complaints but that\u2019s just not the way to go about things.", "YTA... why are you trying to change someone anyway", "Every single day is excessive, and making empty promises that are broken so quickly means it's become habitual.  \n\n\nOn the other hand though, he is an adult and to a degree is entitled to get stoned. If it's not really impacting his ability to work or be a productive member of society you went completely too far.  \n\n\nYTA, That being said though, he's clearly going through something and instead of coming from a place of such hostility, maybe you could sympathize with him and let him vent about why he feels like he needs to be constantly stoned to handle life. In a non-aggro way you can air your concern with the use, and make your support and love for him clear.  \n\n\nI had a period years ago before I met my SO where I fell into a pretty deep and persistent depression for most of winter, well into late summer and was drinking/toking whenever I wasn't working and felt so incredibly alone even though I had people around me.", "NTA. The only problem I see here is that flushing his weed down the toilet won't fix his addiction. I have seen people who claimed they were not addicted to weed (because well, you know, \"weed is not addictive\") shaking and going nuts when they couldn't get their fix on time. This will never be resolved just by getting rid of the drug, he will need to go through detox and this can only be done if he wants to. Unless he decides for himself to detox, he will keep being an addict and will find ways to consume, even if that means hiding it from you.\n\nThe question you should ask yourself is - do you want to live like this?", "NTA. You're going to get a lot of people on here who are pro weed and think your husband's behaviour is perfectly fine. Its not and you should probably have a long hard think about whether you want this to be the rest of your life. How long are you willing to put up with this? What do you think is best for your kids? Maybe just mull this over, see if you can lock him down for a serious conversation about what needs to happen.", "I'm going with ESH, based on some of the responses you've given. He is an adult, and flushing his weed makes you the A, but you also say he's smoking weed because he's unhappy that your love life is on hold because of the kids??? So he does something he knows will drive you further away. This makes zero sense. If he smoked before you got married and continued, that's one thing. But you say he didn't start until after you had a child and don't have as much time for each other. I only went with ESH because flushing it was a dick move, but your husband seems like the bigger AH and the two of you have much bigger problems that you're avoiding. He doesn't seem to adult very well, does he?", "YTA, would have been better for you to control his access to it, so not every day", "ESH - you're only an AH for flushing it; you don't have the right to destroy his property just because you're mad - even if the anger is justified\n\nHe's a MUCH bigger AH because from your post and comments he:\n\n1) Is unhappy with your relationship/intimacy since baby came along so his solution is to... *checks notes* do something that you've made clear absolutely repulses you\n\n2) Is getting high while apparently watching the baby. Now I'm pro weed but this is ridiculous. He needs to grow tf up\n\n3) Again, refuses to even compromise with you on his usage; edibles alone would at least get rid of the smell and you don't HAVE to get crazy high\n\nTo me, it sounds like he's creating a self fulfilling prophecy. His admission to not being happy and that leading to the weed use gives me bad vibes. My pattern recognition tells me he's setting you up. He might want to break up but he doesn't want to be \"the bad guy\" so he's doing this to you so that when you break and leave him, he gets to be the victim\n\nEspecially that weird ass assumption you suddenly didn't want to go on a date night with him\n\nEither that or he's severely depressed and self medicating, which again, grow up and get help. He's a father, it's not all about him anymore", "YTA - I get that you don't like the smell. My mother was that way when she was still with us, and her partner of 30-odd years is a daily smoker. I get that you are frustrated, but the way you are going about this situation is over the top.\n\nI see in one of your comments that you're already in a strained relationship. I would bet the the difficulty of not smoking daily has something to do with that. It is probably helping him cope with difficult emotions surrounding your other issues as a couple. Whether that's a healthy way to cope of not isn't the issue. He's chosen this because he likes it and it works for him. He's a grown man, and this is definitely safer for all involved than drinking every day would be. He's not selling his ass down the street for weed money. He's not putting you out of house and home.\n\nYou had no right to flush his weed down the toilet. You really don't have the right to come down on him so hard over something that is slowly gaining traction for legalization in so many parts of the world. I know that it's down to smell, and the fact that he's stoned for you, which kind of makes your reaction worse, because you threw it out for your own benefit. You might as well have flushed the money he spent on it down the toilet while you were at it.\n\nWhat you should do is get to the bottom of why he isn't respecting your views on this enough to keep it more discreet. I'm guessing that consciously or not, he's feeling controlled, and is rebelling. That's not a healthy manner in which to function, but it's a very human response to being told what to do and when. Work on a realistic compromise as well as the issues in your marriage that clearly need work.", "Lol, can easily brush his teeth and even use just a different shirt ornjacket for smoking.\n\nCompromise is easy.\n\nUnfortunately you have also shown zero ability to do so.\n\n\nAll assholes", "YTA. \n\n1. If he has a psychological addiction, then you just cut him off cold turkey. That\u2019s never healthy for anyone. \n\n2. You destroyed someone\u2019s else\u2019s property. If your answer to a relationship problem is ruin their stuff, then your relationship is already *deeply* broken. \n\n3. You are making demands and do not seem to be compromising yourself. You can ask them to stop, or if the smell bothers you switch to edibles or dabs or vapes which smell significantly less. If the being stoned bothers you, ask them to do it on specific days. Or only in the morning. Or only after a certain time at night (they might use it to sleep). You are acting entitled to total capitulation and the truth is you can ask for it, but \u201cleaving you\u201d is always their own escape hatch when they don\u2019t want to accede to your demands. It takes two to tango.", "ESH he has a problem and is blaming you and will only get worse. The fact that he basically needs it and is sulking over it is ridiculous.

This is probably going to be controversial, but I feel like this kind of behavior only happens in the States. \n\nMost of us when we catch our kids smoking, we get mad and tell them not to do it. Now I understand he\u2019s not your kid, he\u2019s your husband, a grown adult, and you can\u2019t parent him or punish him, and he can make his own decisions. But you\u2019ve been more than reasonable by talking to him, and accepting his behavior long enough. It\u2019s gotten to the point where it bothers you greatly and you\u2019re entitled to feel that way, especially because when you met him/married him he did not do this.\n\nI would have flushed his weed down the toilet as well. It\u2019s childish, his not an adolescence, he\u2019s a grown fucking man. I would suggest talking to him seriously and letting him know how much this is affecting you to the point you\u2019re considering leaving.

I just don't like having him around when he smells like that.\nFurthermore, I find it kind of strange to be intimate with someone who is stoned while you are completely sober yourself. That's why our sex life also suffers greatly. (and it bothers him too. \nHe often blames me that our sex life is on hold.)\n\nI've already told him all of this x times. really, many, many times. At some point he gives in and promises me that he won't smoke weed every day anymore. This promise lasts 24 hours. \nAfter that he seems to forget we ever talked about it and goes back to smoking his joints every day. \n\nYesterday we even arranged to have a kind of date night. He put our son to bed, I only went outside with the dog for a short time and when I came back he was already stoned again. \n\nI don't get it. It's like putting on a perfume that I know will make my partner sick, when I go on a date with him that might involve physical contact. \nWhy should someone do this?\n\nHis excuse was that he thought I wouldn't want to spend time with him anyway today, because a few minutes earlier I told him, that it annoys me when he constantly judges my driving skills. (We were visiting my parents before.) \n\nit really annoys me. especially his promises not to do it every day without sticking to his word. \nIt's not like I'm completely banning him from smoking weed or anything. He can do it when he goes out with friends or at home if he only does it sometimes but not every day. \n\nHe didn't do that when I met him, not when I married him. I just didn't sign for it and I don't want to be with a full-time stoner.\n\nSo yesterday I was so frustrated that he just smoked weed without at least asking if our date was still on. That's why I flushed all his stuff down the toilet. \n\nnow he is angry with me. don't talk to me anymore. just lies in bed all day. doesn't come out of the bedroom. just threatens to throw away my nasal spray away because that's the stuff I'm actually addicted to. \n\nWas it excessive to throw away his weed? perhaps. But he just won't stop on his own and our relationship is suffering extremely as a result. \nWe basically have zero quality time because he's always stoned and smells like a train station underpass in Berlin. \n\nIf I would smoke weed too, I probably wouldn't notice it so badly. but I just don't want to smoke weed because I don't like being stoned.

It's a Loop.", "Weed is like the easiest drug to quit- but it's still not easy. And it's impossible if you don't actually want to do it. So if the hub doesn't want to it will be a forever battle", "Detox\u2026? \u2026From weed?  Bahahahaha", "My landlord said vape is OK, can\u2019t smell it, and he has a sensitive nose.", "ESH your hubby is an addict and you are enabling.\n\nAddicts cannot have a normal partnership because their partner cannot come before the addiction. Competition between a partner and an addiction usually ends up with a failed partnership.\n\nExplain their weed addiction is coming between you two, and if they want a life with you they need to be able to go without weed when it is harming the relationship.\n\nSet a boundary. If by x date they do not start seeing a therapist or going to group or going to an addiction clinic, you are going to need to bring in social support and ask for the help of their parents, friends, etc, because this problem is destroying your marriage.\n\nExplain that if they won't use the word addiction, and they won't take responsibility, then you need to be able to get help and support from outside the marriage which means making the problem known as an addiction problem to your shared social group.\n\nThese problem only get worse when they are treated as harmless bad habits. He can't stop. It's not harmless. It will replace everything you have in your partnership with dope. And dope is a poor replacement for a loved one.", "Kids in the equation- I'd say that's dubious", "To be honest, I think divorce and child support are more expensive. And that's what it comes down to when he doesn't leave even one evening for quality time for us and stays sober.", "Probably the same reason why I don't have sex with people who are drunk while I'm not. That's kind of strange, isn't it? Netflixing together while He is stoned is ok. But intimate things... I have no idea. At that moment I just find it unattractive and strange. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "We have actually agreed on this 1000 times. he can smoke weed. That only ever bothers me when we actually want to spend time together. When he's out with friends, he can happily smoke an entire hemp plantation. I do not care. In the end he still smokes at home every evening. and if he does it every evening, there won't be any evening left for the two of us. You can't actually become addicted to weed? or are there new scientific findings?", "Okay but you're making it seem like something recreational. Its only addictive in the sense that your body has to readjust to you not using it. Its not like Afrin is euphoric or even psychoactive.", "Oh come on. You need to loosen up, just because you shouldn't use it more than a week doesn't make it addictive.", "I have nothing against smoking weed every now and then but if someone can\u2019t go without it they are probably self-medicating.", "are you his mom or his partner?", "This will also help you better see what is happening -- when he's agreeing with you is he lying or afterward is he succumbing. Best of luck !", "[deleted]", "Probably not, because that's a false equivalency. There's no medical alcohol industry.\n\nBut regardless, I do think leaving an alcoholic is sound advice! And if OP hates being married to a smoker, I think she should leave, too.\n\nETA: Upon second thought, I changed my mind. Yes, I would stand by this comment if husband were an alcoholic.", "awww that makes me feel sad, but you are correct that getting blitzed all the time isn't going to do anything. He needs to grow up, and while flushing it was the nuclear option it probably was the most dramatic to get his attention.  \n\n\nLet him get a week or two of sobriety and you guys should go on vacation, even just a weekend trip to go do something together without the stress of kids and awkwardness of him being stoned out his gourd 24/7.", "Honestly you probably can\u2019t even tell he is stoned until he tells you then you get mad", "Can I upvote this more than once. Smoked for years and when wife wanted me to quit I dropped it that day haven\u2019t even touched it since.  Alcohol, benzodiazepines, narcotics different story", "You\u2019re advising someone to go to an addiction clinic?  For marijuana?", "not strange at all unless they're barely conscious or alert. what is it you find unattractive about him when he's stoned?", "Gentle YTA.  I've been married to my husband for 19 years. He's an Army Combat Vet and I'm a Navy Vet. He smokes weed due to his severe PTSD and it doesn't bother me one bit. It helps him relax, I don't care because my husband is relaxed, not stressed out and still manages to handle his responsibilities inside the home.  He does it when the kids go to sleep for the evening and uses it as his unwinding time.  He used to drink heavily, which did bother me, but I wouldn't pour his alcohol down the drain, I just told him I couldn't deal with the drinking and if he didn't stop or get help, I was taking the kids and leaving him.  You may have to make a decision soon. If his smoking is causing problems in your marriage, you may have to make a choice because you can't force him to stop. Flushing his stuff down the toilet is only going to breed resentment towards you. I would also be concerned about the smoking around your child.  Do what you have to do to protect him, don't put up with this...but don't destroy things in the process either, that will only make the situation worse.  Good luck, I totally sympathize with you.", "I also don\u2019t smoke weed but my friends have said that sex is many times better while high. It\u2019s \u201cmindblowing\u201d according to them so maybe thats also why your husband does that? He should try edibles tho if you can\u2019t stand the smell or he could try carts (?) i\u2019ve heard it smells less noticeable", "Who tf told u , u can't get addicted to weed. Coz they are a million percent WRONG.  U can get addicted to literally anything.  Especially when it changes your brain chemicals like weed, alcohol etc", "Afrin is widely known to be addictive. She isn't being weird or stupid about this, she's using normal terminology for a thing she's going through", "Yeah same with those addicts that take anxiety medication every day, right?", "What's your suggestion?", "yes, I know why he smokes. He said it makes him feel better because he's unhappy that we haven't had as much time together since we became parents. but that's just stupid. Because it is precisely through daily consumption that there is no longer any chance that anything will change. Unless I don't care about anything and it's suddenly common in a relationship that one person can do whatever they want and the other one endures it in silence and fulfills all expectations without having needs of their own.", "There's a medical ketamine industry, does it mean your husband should do lines of k every day around his child? Or opium?\n\nJust because something can be used in a medical context, doesn't mean it's safe and okay to be used every single day at home.", "Why is that funny? I live in one of the most drug liberal countries in the world, and our addiction clinics very much treat marijuana addicts. I know it because my ex boyfriend went through a program with them for weed addiction - something he decided himself, because he felt like he couldn't stop even if he wanted to. \n\nYou can be addicted to anything from weed to alcohol to tobacco to gambling to sex.", "Aside from the smell, he's like a potato when he's stoned", "He told me", "You can develop a psychological dependence to anything, but only specific substances will have the withdrawal symptoms of a physical addiction.  \n\nThe only instances I've seen of people experiencing physical withdrawal symptoms of marijuana were in EXTREMELY heavy users, and by that I mean heavier use than OP's husband.  Even then, the symptoms were very mild in comparison to other addictive substances.  \n\nFrom my experience: I'm a daily marijuana user, but I only smoke at the end of the day.  When I was a morning/noon/night smoker in my early 20's and stopped cold turkey I definitely experienced mild withdrawal symptoms, but they went away pretty quickly.  Compare this to last month when I spent a week in Paris and wasn't able to smoke at all--the only thing I experienced was that it took maybe 30 minutes longer to fall asleep for the first 3 days of the trip, then I was completely fine.", "Yes? People who need anxiety medication to function need help.", "Okay, well I disagree with you. Feel free to argue elsewhere", "Why do you think it is funny?  I didn\u2019t mention that it is funny. It is pretty ridiculous though. Someone shouldn\u2019t have to go to an addiction clinic just because their partner is controlling and doesn\u2019t like the smell.", "relaxed?", "You're absolutely right to feel that way. I've had partners were we would smoke it up together and be in the same head space and it was fine. With partners who don't smoke or don't like it then I just come to some agreement where I can smoke it at certain times and just have some alone time if they rightly don't wanna be around someone who's stoned when they're sober. I personally hate being around anyone whos drunk or stoned when I'm sober and I would hate to be in a relationship with someone whos constantly stoned if I was not.", "Weed addiction is unlike other drug addiction in some aspects but unfortunately, you can still be addicted. Some say it's only phycological but even if that's the case, it'll affect you physically as a result.", "100% you can have an addiction to weed and he clearly has. It's not an addiction in the same way as drugs like heroin were it's an almost uncontrollable physiological addiction, tis more of a mental addiction in that he likes being high and doesn't want to not be high. He won't feel like he's going to die tho without it or anything like that and he'll prob feel a lot better about life in general if he gets out of this state of being high 24/7 and just letting life pass by in a cloud of smoke.", "HE LIED  I've been a health professional for 30 years. So he needs help in a big way. Mentally and addiction wise.", "The.. medication... *Is* the help?"]}
