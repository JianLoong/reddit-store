What % of the mortgage is it and how does it compare to the rent you pay now?", "INFO: What would you be doing for a living situation if you were not living with him?", "I was undecided until I saw your reply that you would have to get rid of your furniture to move in....  Also, because you are okay NOT moving in with him.\n\nNTA - and don't move in together until you are both on the same financial page.\n\nSo it makes perfectly good sense that he doesn't want you to own a part of his house or have a claim to it.  That is just reasonable financial management of his assets.\n\nWith that thought, you also deserve protection for your home and living arrangements which means some sort of lease agreement where he can't just kick you out and leave you homeless and that does not leave you in worse financial shape than you are currently.\n\nSo if you want to find an arrangement that is financial fair for both of you, you start with the following:\n\nHe hands over the past 2 years of bills, hydro, utilities, internet, water, etc.  if he has not done so already so you can see what the costs of running his house is and how that compares to the costs of your apartment.   These are the operational costs of the house - not the ownership costs (taxes, mortgage) you are going to want to figure out what the average cost is going to be and how it compares to your current rent/operating costs.    Don't forget to include changes in transportation costs between the two places.  Will you need to drive more? what does that do to your car insurance and gas?\n\nNext if he kicks you out, figure out what you would need to restart your life and establish a new home - securiity deposits,  moving vans, purchases, etc.  That is money you need to have and not touch or money you need to be able to save up and not touch.\n\nBy the way, not being able to bring my own furniture would be a thanks but no thanks dealbreaker for me, you need to figure it out if it would be for you as well.   But besides that if there are purchases for the house after you move in together how will that work?   Joint ownership and what happens to them if you split up?  Who buys what?\n\nWhat are the redecorating rules?  Can you hang paintings? do you get a OP room?  How are the chores split up?\n\nAfter that is sorted out - it should be written out in the lease agreement who is responsible for what bills for how much, how long you have to move out if you break up (hold out for at least 2 months preferably 3 so you have time to find a place to live) that you have no claim to the house and thus are not responsible for insurance, repairs, taxes etc.\n\nNext up, you need to figure out what living with him is worth to you.  For me, I would pay no more than 50% of what I am paying in rent/utilities/total housing because I value my own space and privacy, you need to figure out your financial number.  If that number is unacceptable to your BF, then you two don't move in together.", "It sounds like he wants someone to help pay for his mortgage.  You were on the fence about moving in, and I think you would be wise to wait another year.  \n\nIt\u2019s not necessarily unfair to expect rent, but when he mentioned it is important.  Did he spring the rent idea on you after you agreed to move in or before?  If he invited you to live in his home like you\u2019re a guest, but then sprang the rent idea on you after you\u2019ve ended a lease or started moving in, he\u2018s kind of an AH.  If he\u2019s charging you rent, you should have a lease and he needs to declare it as income.", "YTA for not wanting to pay rent. \n\n>I am technically living somewhere with a roof over my head for free.\n\nThat roof is not free, he has to pay for it.

If you want to keep your place and your independence until you feel ready, tell him that.\n\nLiving together often means joining finances (even just coming up with a spending/saving/debt plan), and it's worth figuring out while you're still living separately.", "YTA - freeloading is freeloading.

You have no problem paying it to live in an apartment. Don't get people that think because they're not on a deed or mortgage should live for free. The time to complain is when you get charged to replace appliances and home repairs.", "NAH\n\nPersonally I would be reluctant to move out of a nice affordable apartment to live with someone. It isn't a question of morality but practicality because if you are married there is a legal commitment and so if the relationship ends, you are protected in terms of finances.\n\nIf the relationship breaks up with a boyfriend (or girlfriend) you would be forced to move out and in my experience you would probably be forced to pay more money for a worse apartment than you are now living in.\n\nNo judgment but if you can't navigate the very basic issue of living expenses maybe you should wait until things are clearer. You stay in your place with your affordable rent. He stays at his place with the same expenses he always had and you and he stay over at each other's respective places when it is convenient for both.", "It\u2019s fair for you to contribute rent, particularly if you would be paying rent to live somewhere else.

Not equally if he's making way more than you, but something at least. But if you don't want to, don't move in - you said you weren't that motivated to anyway. And if you do move in, have a formal lease agreement. It protects you both.", "YTA.  People in partnerships pay their fair share.  Paying into the household rent is a fair ask.   \n\n\nUnless it's some huge mortgage and he's asking for half.  In which case you'd negotiate a more reasonable amount.

It is in his best interests to have you pay because when you break up... you know...\n\nYtA", "Hmm whilst probably YTA for expecting to live rent free because you would have to pay wherever you were. I still also feel it\u2019s harsh when he doesn\u2019t need the money makes 5/6 times your salary and if you pay half the utilities he\u2019s already better off since you living there won\u2019t double them.", "YTA\n\nDo you know what it costs beyond the principal payments - the only part that adds equity - to own a house?  Like property taxes and insurance and maintenance and repairs and replacing broken appliances?  He's not building equity with any of that spending - including the interest that is the largest part of his mortgage payment.  \n\nYou aren't married.  You aren't even engaged.  You aren't entitled to any portion of his assets. You living there and paying rent does not mean you have any financial interest in the house, just as you have no financial interest in the place you are renting now. \n\nHe's offering you a sweet deal - living is a larger space with someone you maybe kinda like for probably less than you are paying now. Demanding part of something he has worked for since long before he met you in addition is seriously entitled behavior. \n\nPut the money you are saving by paying less in rent living with him into a savings account and maybe you can buy a house with him in the future.", "YTA - you should be contributing in some capacity, and groceries just doesnt cut it.

You need to make it very clear that if you are paying rent, there will be a written lease AND you will not contribute towards the maintenance/upgrades to the house.  That will be his responsibility 100%.  That means if an appliance goes out, it is his responsibility to replace it.\n\nThat lease should also lay out clearly what the terms of terminating the lease would be should the relationship end.

He made the commitment to pay for that loan. Regardless if you are in the picture or not that's the situation he chose for himself and you are not costing him any money by moving in. Actually you are saving him some money if you split the utilities and other costs 50/50. Yes, while utilities costs increase it won't double, so he'll have to pay less.

Why would I make the life of someone I love harder by taking their money, that I don't need, when I'm already not loosing any? \n\nAnd on top of everything he gave you an ultimatum to either move in with him or break up?

Just because he's been paying it all on his own previously doesn't mean you should get to move in for half of utilities etc. It'd be much more equitable to cover all the utilities etc. since he's still paying the whole mortgage, insurance and all the other costs that are associated with owning a home.", "YTA", "If you live with him, pay rent and sign a rental agreement.

I've never payed rent living with my partner before. I guess it would depend on where you are at in the relationship and what your needs look like? You are paying for your food and your utilities, and it sounds like he would be fine paying for his home if living alone.

If ya'll are still early in the relationship, or he is not in a mentally great place to commit to someone living with him right now, I'd suggest renting a place away from him to allow that kind of thinking space.

What is his idea of the intended timeline for your relationship progression? Is he saying when he wants to get engaged if all goes well? And then when marriage happens after that? Do kids factor in? Does this all align with your wants too? Have you discussed how you see your career and it's progression? How will he support that? How will you split chores? If kids ARE in the equation, does the chore split change then? Do either of you have the expectation or desire for you to be a SAH parent? What about him, since he's working at home?

If you can't trust your partner, why are you living together?\n\nIt's fair for her to pay rent - it just depends on the amount.

Completely changes things. People aren't reading through all of OPs comments for the context here.", "I'm so glad I scrolled all the way down to read this comment, as I was about to create a new post asking if I was the AH for being in the bf's position. The circumstances were shockingly similar, with only a couple of minor yet important differences. Let me explain:\n\nI was 30, she was 25, and we were living together in a fairly nice, but small, townhouse for 11 months (dated almost 2 years prior to cohabitation) and split rent and all bills down the middle. Instead of renewing our lease or looking for a new place, I suggested that I buy a house for us to live in if she pays the utility and grocery bills. This scenario would save her over 60% in monthly expenses while upgrading to a much larger 4 br house with a large walled-in back yard and extended 3 car garage, so she was quite ecstatic. I was making over 5 times her salary, so I didn't feel the need to ask her to chip in beyond food and utilities.\n\nI didn't ask her to sign any paperwork, as I trusted her completely (and this crazy little thing called love), but moreover, I didn't want to be put in the position that our downvoted friend outlined above. Within the first month, I realized everything aforementioned by our Dale Gribble avatared fellow commenter was absolutely true. Yes, I had the best of intentions, and it was a mutually beneficial situation, and no, I didn't pressure her moving in together or spring on her that I would charge rent after she broke her rent controlled lease like the bf in OP's situation, but I also realized I was in the clearly advantageous position. I stumbled into it, whereas the bf in OP's case is clearly manipulating an inexperienced, naive young woman who is getting downvoted for asking innocent questions like how much monthly rent would be fair.\n\nWhen I first started reading all the comments saying how OP is the AH, I thought that eventually, someone would point out how the bf is a way bigger AH for being the puppetmaster in creating this situation where he can only benefit and she can only lose. I had to scroll all the way down to one of the last comments before someone pointed out the real villain here, and that person got downvoted. \n\nYes, what everyone else said is true in that she should chip her fair share; she shouldn't get a free ride; she would pay rent either way to the bf or a landlord, etc, BUT are glossing over the fact that this is a relationship also, not a strictly business roommate transaction. I felt like an AH at the time (I guess I sort of still do) and was waiting for the clever and witty reddit community to look at it from the bf's perspective and call him out but only 1 commenter did, and that person was immediately defecated upon. I feel bad for OP as all her responses were downvoted, but it feels like she's just asking for advice/help in an unwinnable situation. If she kept her lease (and sublet her rent controlled apt if allowed), she would have a fallback option, but right now, she's in quite the paradoxical situation and no one is chiming in with an outside perspective to help other than you're the AH for not paying to live with your financially stable bf. \n\nHonestly, I think they are both AH, but the bf is a far greater one. Constructive criticisms and observations are welcome...", "He doesn\u2019t own it outright, she said he\u2019s still paying a mortgage.", "It seems to me like an appropriate compromise would be one that benefits both of you in some way.\n\nFor example, you should be paying more than $0 in rent but less than you currently pay for an apartment by yourself.\n\nYou being willing to pay only for your share of groceries and utilities is unreasonably selfish of you. You living there will add to the wear and tear / increase the maintenance costs. It will also reduce the amount of space that your BF has to himself. You should be paying rent to offset those in addition to paying for the food you eat and your share of the increased utility bills.", "I gain no equity from paying my landlord rent. In the future, if she becomes more than a girlfriend, they can discuss refinancing and adding her to the title. She benefits from having a place to live. It's not unfair to want someone who's living with you to contribute. Apparently, OP said that their bf doesn't want a specific amount. Just whatever she wants to pay. Heck, my stepdad and stepbrother died last year. Stepbrother and his wife lived behind my mom's house. My mom hasn't charged her rent because she was in the accident, but she's going to start charging her because it's fair. She's family, but it doesn't mean she shouldn't contribute fairly.", ">If his expenses don\u2019t go up as a result of her, than what is she paying for exactly?\n\nCan't that logic be applied to any lodging you don't own? \"This hotel pays the same amount to lease the land whether or not I stay the night here, so my stay should be free.\" \n\nWhat? \n\n>but if she isn\u2019t costing anyone that rent then technically why?\n\nShould I be able to live for free in any random stranger's house then because technically I won't be increasing their mortgage?

Even opening/closing doors more often can make a difference. Extra sewage/water, faster deterioration of appliances and carpet/flooring, gas/electric usage goes up, etc. OP's bf didn't force her to move in. OP has the option to live elsewhere and not have to deal with a landlord for a bf.", "You can\u2019t compare your situation as a tenant to OP\u2019s situation as a gf. Sounds like the bf doesn\u2019t need the money and just wants it. Gf wasn\u2019t sure about moving in in the first place, now he\u2019s expecting her to help him pay his mortgage. On his house. That he owns. That only he builds any equity on.", "I\u2019m asking what she is paying for.\n\nAnd asking technically why.\n\nThese are good questions. The answer could be anything - you assume I mean zero.

They weren't ever tenants. My stepdad built an apartment for his son's family because he was disabled. They lived there rent-free the whole time (years). Not \"needing\" money/rent doesn't mean he doesn't deserve it and that she shouldn't pay it. It's just called being a decent person and not whining about paying what you owe.", "So reverse the situation, OP's boyfriend is moving in with her in her current apartment. He doesn't have to pay right? She was already handling it herself so he has no responsibility to take any kind of financial pressure off her while moving into her space and he's free to leech off her for as long as he'd like. After all, what is he paying for?", "I don't disagree about the scale of landlords. And again, corporate vulture landlords should be regulated. But that's a govt issue, and it gets conflated with the average small business landlord.", "yes"]}
