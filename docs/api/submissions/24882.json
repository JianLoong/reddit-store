I noticed their little sign only said \u201cLemonade\u201d, but didn\u2019t have a price, so I asked them how much for a cup.\n\n$9.00\n\nNow I know inflation has hit hard but NINE DOLLARS for a dixie cup of powder mix lemonade?? Nuh uh. Is it an expense I can afford? Technically yes. Is it a price I\u2019m willing to pay? Sorry, but no. \n\nI tried to be as kind as I could, I said something along the lines of \u201cOoh I\u2019m sorry girls, that\u2019s a little pricy for me, but good luck!\u201d And drove off with a smile and a wave. My friend who was in the car told me I was cruel to do so.

I make enough to get by, but I just can\u2019t justify in my head spending $9 on lemonade from a roadside stand.

You can get a like 3 fulls bottles of GOOD lemonade for that price.", "NTA\u2026actually, you taught them an important business lesson. When you price yourself out of the market, that\u2019s what happens. Is it wrong because they were only kids? I don\u2019t think so. Lessons can be learned at any age. I would have passed on the lemonade also.", "NTA\n\nSorry but their lemonaid should be 2-3 dollars at most, not Disney Park prices. cute Kid tax exists but it's not 9 Dollars.", "NTA seems like those kids were counting on people to be suckers and pay up. Your friend could have bought a cup if she wanted to.", "NTA\n\nAs far as I know selling lemonade is a learning experience for children. You taught them that not all customers are alright with being ripped off, which is valuable in its own way.\n\nSeriously, lemonade from powder or concentrate should not be 5 times the price of a carbonated soda. Whoever put them op to this should have informed them.", "NTA.  Correct me if I'm wrong, and I might get downvoted for this but aren't the point of lemonade stands to be both fun and a learning experience for kids?  What parent agreed to this stand, and told their child it was a good idea to sell their lemonade at that price....this is setting the kid up for heartbreak!!!  I mean sure some people will pay, some but i think most people are like you OP, and $9.00 for a dixie cup of lemonade is just too steep a price", "Nta. You cant afford it, told them you cant and go.

This reads like an old joke.\n\n\"How much is your lemonade?\"\n\n\"$100\"\n\n\"That's crazy! How can you expect people to buy at that price?\"\n\n\"We only need one.\"", "NTA.

That's opportunistic :D NTA, but maybe you could have haggled?", "NTA,", "NTA $9 for a small cup of lemonade is ridiculous", "NTA - that's robbery.", "wow, NTA. i think i would've thought they were joking and laughed.", "NTA. It sucks that the price wasn't listed anywhere, but you were nice to wish them luck when you didn't buy any. Spending $9 on a cup of lemonade is a lot.", "NTA\n\n\nI don't care how young they are that's highway robbery.", "NTA - $9 is too expensive. Hopefully the lesson they learn is \"when you are selling an item in a highly saturated market you have to price inline with your competition\". You can get better drinks for less, the only thing they have going for them is cuteness and nostalgia but for most people that isn't worth the $7 bucks extra they are charging for it.", "NTA x100. \n\nWelcome to the real world kiddos!", "Totally not the asshole.

Its more easier to say no online than in real life\nSince they were little girls it makes it more harder to say no, but you said it and its not a bad thing\n9$ for a lemonade?

Were the proceeds meant to be donated to a good cause or anything else to justify the mark-up on the price?
