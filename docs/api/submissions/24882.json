You don't really say how old the kids are, and there's obviously an age-appropriate dimension to how sophisticated those lessons are, but you could probably have negotiated in an age-appropriate way.  \n\n\"I'm used to paying around $1 or $2 for a lemonade.

We were quite proud of ourselves. NTA OP, $9 is highway robbery. I\u2019m sure there weren\u2019t many takers.", "NTA - Those kids will get a lesson in pricing goods.

At most, if my wife and I are in the car together, we\u2019ll hand them a crisp $5 for 2 cups of lemonade + tip. \n\nI\u2019d have done the same thing. $9 is just too much and hopefully their parents can help guide them on how to adjust.

You are teaching them the economics principle of supple and demand.  There just isn\u2019t a demand for $9 dixie cups of lemonade", "NTA. Even Starbucks may hesitate to charge $9 for a thimble of lemonade.\n\nYou taught the girls a valuable lesson in economics and marketing. Set a price that the market will bear. If they get enough refusals at the $9 price point, they may see sense and lower the price. Consider making up in volume what a reduction in sales price may bring.\n\nYou work hard for your money.

She had yellow balloons and lemon decor with a glass dispenser on her table and she would wear a yellow dress and quietly asked people that stopped by if they would like some lemonade. She didn't have a price sign because we thought she might make more if she didn't have a set price, but when asked she said 50\u00a2 a cup. She sold 28 cups her first time at age 4 and made $28.40.

The market will simply not bear $9 for lemonade stand lemonade no matter how adorable the salespeople are.", "NTA. My kids did a lemonade stand a few years ago, and part of market research was learning what lemonade is being sold for elsewhere.

I had no concept of the worth of a used item and overpriced everything. The people stopping by to look noticed, thought it was funny, and offered less for things that they wanted.

If your friend thinks that was a small cost, did she buy herself a cup or two?\n\nAnd at $9, are uou supposed to hand over a $10and be ok with them \"not having change?\"  I feel like they should have immediately followed that price with one of those infomercial spiels: \"But WAIT!! But now and get a ham sandwich free! And that's not all!!! Buy two cups and get not only two ham sandwiches, but also an almost empty bag of chips! Separate tips expected for all. \"\n\nYou're so NTA.", "NTA. The kid\u2019s have gotta learn to price accordingly and not rely on just being cute kids. Lol. Would your friend think you were an asshole if it was $50? $100?", "NTA. To my knowledge, the purpose of lemonade stands was always to teach entreprenurial kids the importance of making smart business decisions. It's not just a cutesy activity like hopscotch, especially not when they're charging real money in exchange for the lemonade; it's an opportunity to learn what motivates people to shop, what motivates them to spend, how much they're willing to spend for what they're being offered, and why balancing the operational costs of the business with a reasonable price of goods and services for a healthy profit isn't always going to rake in a large amount of money because you can't just charge whatever you want. Often in the business world it's just enough to keep the lights on and maybe a little extra saved up for the months when the bills and income cut it close, not always enough for someone to get ahead.\n\nFor all you know, you may have actually taught the kids a very important lesson. If they're wise about it, they'll either drop their prices to something more approrpriate in the way of what customers expect and are willing to pay, or if they insist on keeping the price high, perhaps they could offer some kind of additonal good or service in a package deal to round out the expenses as more of a bargain in the customer's mind. A glass of lemonade and a nice  homemade snack could tip over $5 easily. But I believe your response teaches them the valuable lesson they need to learn from this experience far more than your friend's insistence that you just spend money on something so the other person doesn't feel bad. That's not how the world works, and lemonade stands offer kids the opportunity to understand how the world works.", "NTA. A few years ago my now husband and I saw a lemonade stand and we asked for a cup each. It was a dollar per cup. My husband gave the little girl $10. Her mom was so thankful and gave us some cookies (store bought) that they were selling for free even though I guess we technically paid lol seeing that little girls face light up was so nice! But $9? That\u2019s insane lol", "What? $9 for Lemonade from a kids stand? Whaaaaat? Back when I was younger we sold that for .50c. I'm surprised! NTA, tho.

For $9 per Dixie cup, there better be something in it to make me pretty happy LMAOOOOOOO \n\nBut truthfully, they\u2019re learning basic economics. They can sell 9 x $1 per hour, 1 x $9 per hour or anything in between.

Nope, $9? nope, nope, nope.", "i like to imagine there is something they want that cost exactly $9 and they just need one customer.", "You didn\u2019t do anything bad no, but I don\u2019t think they understand the value of money and it might have helped them if you explained why it\u2019s too much, and what a good amount is", "NTA you have no commitment to them whatsoever, and it\u2019s their parents job to teach them that they can\u2019t expect mounds of money for a single glass of something that cost them 5 dollars to get a jug of.\nEdit: it also would have been a bad idea to buy the lemonade, because it would teach them that they were doing the right thing selling a glass of lemonade for nine dollars.", "NTA, $9 is very expensive for some Lemonade.

Where do you draw the line on being nice to cute kids? What if they had asked for $20? You can go to a fancy lemonade store and get a big fancy fresh squeezed lemonade with special extras like lavender for less than $9. I think your refusal was a teaching moment. And while most child-run lemonade sales are fueled by cuteness/pity, those kids were either wildly out of touch with prices because they're children, or they're trying to manipulate people into paying a jacked up price, or their parents led them astray on the pricing. They could use some guidance from customer data. Rejection from a kind stranger builds character.
