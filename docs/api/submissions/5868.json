I love him dearly but he does things that drive me nuts. He spends most of his time with mom in a different state and was visiting us for holidays. We hadn\u2019t seen him in over 155 days. In that time from July 20 through December 5, all of our texts and calls were unanswered and the ex did nothing to help. To say that we, my husband and I, were devastated and broken emotionally and mentally throughout this time would be fair. We even went so far as to do wellness checks via the sheriffs dept about 4x to just put our fears at ease and make sure he was ok. \n\nWhile he\u2019s been up here we\u2019ve been talking college and future plans and goals. He is halfway through his junior year and has said that he would like to be here for school or just life after high school as his mom is beyond controlling. (He isn\u2019t allowed to be home alone, he has zero access to email as she controls it, with the click of a button she can shut off his phone, learn his location, etc. we don\u2019t send gifts because we don\u2019t want them confiscated and he agrees)\n\nNow, while I know a couple things are valid and everyone can or should be able to agree on- \n1. No one is entitled to my $\n2. No one is entitled to a college education \n3. My $ my rules\u2026 \n\nYet, here\u2019s where I feel I may be an ahole\u2026 \nDespite my constant reassurances to Sean to not look at my ultimatum as emotional blackmail or anything like that, I had a dream last night that is causing me to waiver\u2026 \n\nI told Sean that while I love him and will forever be proud of him and his dad and I will always have a home for him; if he puts us through the emotional and mental upheaval of ignoring us the whole time he\u2019s back with mom, I will not give any assistance. I will not give help to those who don\u2019t care about nor respect us. 155 days we had to wait to see him and over 300 messages and phone calls were left unanswered simply because \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like talking\u201d. \n\nI don\u2019t want to be told I\u2019m in the wrong, and while I might be, I reiterated for him not to see this as anything but assurance to us that we won\u2019t be kept in the dark. (We\u2019re already in a heated legal battle since his mom refuses to reimburse costs, refused to share school info, login info, etc. this year the school changed where and how parents access info and we\u2019ve been begging literally begging her to talk to us about what he is up to and how he is doing for over 155 days!!) \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to expect communication, and I want to protect my husband from further emotional and mental stress. I do not think it\u2019s unreasonable, as it\u2019s stated in the legal paperwork, for us to know his school stuff so we can plan and discuss the future! Courses grades etc. stuff I need to know for college applications/trade school enrollment, etc. \n\nSo dear redditors, am I the ahole for telling my son that he either talks to us 2x a week and answers our texts once a day, or I will not be giving financial assistance for any future plans he may have?\n\nPoints:\n1. Neither of his mom nor my husband can offer assistance \n2. His mom simply wants him to stay with her and work together at Pizza Hut so she can get his paychecks to cover he bills \n3. He has no car but does have a license \n4. He does seem more interested in trade than college, perfectly fine of course, but they each take start up $$ that only I can provide\n5. I grew up in an abusive life and I never want to inflict that onto my own kids or see it happen to anyone\u2026 \n6. Sean is extremely sheltered and Donna is worse than a helicopter parent. He has little socialization skills nor work knowledge and needs all the help he can get.\n\nFinal edit:\nHey everyone Sean here. Why I want to say thank you for the support I have to come to parents defense. What she isn\u2019t telling you is that I ignored her and dad of my own free will. My mom is very overbearing and helicopter like, extremely!! But while mom says what I can download on my phone, she doesn\u2019t prevent me talking to Dad or Cassie. So I appreciate everyone coming to my defense but Cassie has never abused me and she and dad are the reason I\u2019m better than I was. A l of crap has happened to our family, but I\u2019m going to ask mods to not blame Cassie for me asking to delete this or deactivate it. Cassie and dad are wonderful parents and I wish I was with them and my little bro.

If you or your husband have legal paperwork giving you rights to his school information, then take that up with the school or Sean\u2019s mom. You\u2019re putting a lot of pressure on a teenager to meet your needs.

It shouldn't be his responsibility to look after any of his parent's emotional well-being -- including you and his dad. By the sounds of it he's going through hell with his mom, and your demanding he do something he obviously finds extremely difficult to allow him to escape from her eventually. Of course he's going to say he's 100% ok with your deal, he's desperate.  \n\nA better solution would be to get to the bottom of why he finds it so difficult to keep in touch, and try to address that problem rather than effectively threatening him. If when he's asked how are things going, and it ends up stirring up drama between you two and his mom, you shouldn't have to ask. But what if she's monitoring his phone/text messages and yells/guilts him every time he responds? What if he's in survival mode and doesn't want to consider how he's doing?

Sounds like Sean is suffering from two overbearing mother figures. 300 messages and phone calls in 155 sounds like a bit much. \n\n\nYou know his mother can control his phone yet you still blame him for not responding. Chances are good HE is also emotionally exhausted. And now you want to throw money in his face. \n\n\nYou mention how much stress he\u2019s put his dad under, but this sounds like more of a mom and dad issue. If she\u2019s not upholding parts of the customer arrangement then he needs to take her to court. \n\nBut back off of Sean. Being 17 is hard enough.", "YTA. \n\nHe lives with his mom who you call controlling but because you didn't hear from him between July and December you arranged four welfare checks by the Sheriffs department and in the same time, you had over 300 unanswered messages and phone calls. That is 2+ attempts to contact him every day but you say this was because he didn't feel like talking. And now you are demanding daily texts and twice weekly chats in return for your assistance? Have you considered how much pressure you are putting on Sean, who you also state has little socialisation skills?\n\nI presume since you've seen him in person you've confirmed it is the the case he didn't feel like talking, and it wasn't that he was being prevented from contacting you by his mother.\n\nBut if his mother controls his phone and access to email, why haven't you helped him set up an email account she can't control and got him a new smart phone she can't turn off/suspend the service on.\n\nAnd now you are putting conditions on your assistance, when you say you are the only one who can assist him. That hints at financial and emotional abuse to me.", "i think your putting all the blame on sean for lack of communication when essentially and you mentioned it yourself that his mother blocks all his access a good portion of the time.  my advice is to put urself in his shoes how hard it is to fight h is own mother who controls every aspect of his life and only allowing him to come see u both becuase she is required legally to do so.  when you are a child and grow up in an enviroment like that you become conditioned over the years to the point yes ur not only naive but u dont have any life skills and cant fight back.   i did not see this mentioned but have u thought about taking his mother to court? or have you in past?", "I\u2019m thinking YTA. \n\n300+ attempts to communicate and several welfare checks in 155 days?\n\nIt can be really super annoying to be \u201cspammed\u201d by relatives texting. Just FYI. My mother in law texts us novels, multiple long random videos and photos. Tons of them. Daily. ALL about her or her feelings. I used to respond but the amount of stuff she sends is overwhelming and became annoying. We no longer respond but she doesn\u2019t get the hint. \n\nIf you\u2019re communicating with Sean like that, consider it a YOU problem. \n\nAlso. It\u2019s not up to the mom whether you have access to school stuff. If you\u2019re a legal guardian the school should be able to provide access for you. If the school will not, there\u2019s a bigger reason you aren\u2019t telling us.", "YTA. That kid is living with an emotionally abusive parent and doing everything he can to make it through high school.  I bet his mom loses her crap if he replies (you mentioned that she has full access to his phone and uses it to punish him).  Tell him you look forward to him moving in with you when he graduates HS and then figure out the rules once he gets there.  Right now, he\u2019s in a terrible situation and you are making it worse.\n\nAlso, therapy for when he gets to you.", "I\u2019m sorry after \u201clast night I had a dream\u201d I quit reading", "OP -first of all  trades are currently offering apprenticeships right now.

But you are punishing him for that. WTF! He wants to come stay with you but you would rather punish him for being in an abusive situation? You and your husband need to get an f'in clue.

I\u2019m", "You just described his mom as controlling, manipulative and overbearing but you some how think he can magically change all this when he goes home? Definitely YTA. You and his father are his last and only lifeline out of that situation and you're about to cut it by these demands that he cannot fulfill. If you actually care about the boy then you need to prepare to go get him the day he graduates from high school or turns 18, which is ever 1st. Then he should be legally an adult and can escape that woman.", "YTA - this is all about you and this ia all about control.\n\nThis kid is teling you how he wants to get away from a controlling parent, and while you are happy to nsipe at her for being controlling it has never entered your mind that while she is cutting access through her, she can also cut all direct access because she controls all of his devices.\n\nAre you that needy and self-obsessed that you actually want to punish a kid because his abusive parent is isolating him so you feel you don't get enough acknowledgement? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBuy the kid a flip phone and a solar charger so he has a method of communication that he can control for a start.\n\nHis mother is an asshole, no doubt, but in this situation you are very, very clearly the asshole.\n\nAnd there seems to be a black hole where his father is too.", "Sorry, this is gonna be a long comment.\n\nI'm not sure what my judgemental is entirely on this, but am leaning toward a gentle Y T A for the ultimatum. Given how controlling his mom is, it's entirely possible, even likely, that if she saw him talking to you (or even suspected he would talk to you) she would cut off contact because she doesn't want you talking to each other.\nIt's very likely that with how controlling she is she is also emotionally manipulative and talks shit about you and your husband to your son.\n\nThe fact that he wants to get away from her and live close to you guys is huge. If you can, I'd talk with him seriously about him going to therapy when he's out from under her thumb because being controlled like that by a parent is hugely damaging and can lead you to have false expectations of the world and the people around you. It can also lead to being either very dependant on everyone around you to the point of driving people away, or being so independent that you never ask for or accept the help that you need until you are visibly hurt.\n\nFrom what you said, it sounds like he is going through a form of abuse and is looking for a way out. He may not feel like talking because of what he's going through with his mom. He might be depressed or feel like his thoughts and feelings aren't important and that he therefore has nothing to say.\nIf any of that is even remotely the case, Y W B T A in this scenario for essentially denying him help to escape a terrible situation. Offer him help and support, get him to see a therapist, and teach him how to be independent, because his mom sure as hell isn't.\nIt's a parent's job to teach their children how to be functional people in their adulthood, and he's not getting that education where he is now.", "ESH \n\nYou and your husband and his mom are all treating this kid like shit! He gets his phone taken and he's under constant surveillance, you've called the cops on this kid because he, like any kid, is terrible at answering his phone and now you are emotionally blackmailing him for your money. It sucks that he doesn't answer your calls and texts but I wouldn't be very interested in doing that either if I had two sets of helicopter parents, no social life, and was treated like such a burden. He's going to grow up and never talk to any of you ever again.", "ESH. He's in a situation where his mam literally controls everything, way too much for a 17 year old to go through, she could be the reason for his lack of communication. However, you're not helping.\n\nI know you don't want to see Sean go through abuse like this with your own experience, but you are still applying this additional pressure on him", "Yta. Using finances to manipulate someone is abusive. He\u2019s in a bad situation with his bio mom and you\u2019re not helping. Either way he\u2019s going to have controlling people in his life. I would be more worried if he\u2019s depressed and as a parent do all I can to create a safe space for them. If he wanted to go to school near you wouldn\u2019t the likely scenario be him around you all more? All you did was show you don\u2019t have his back, are not an unconditional parent, and make him out to be the problem when it\u2019s the bio mom you should be dealing with and not making the situation worse. He\u2019s only entitled to your money when you are entitled to controlling his life as bio mom.", "YTA this is a clear case of abuse, and instead of offering to help him out when he turns 18 and graduates, you're PUNISHING HIM. Do you understand how shitty that must make him feel? He has nobody to turn to.", "I think it is reasonable to expect a relationship with the person whose education you are funding. But putting specific parameters on it \u2018he has to text once per day and call twice per week\u2019 seems a little crazy to me.

Years. He won\u2019t be happy messaging anyone for a long time, and you adding extra emotional weight to messaging is just making it harder. Who matters the most in this situation? Your grown up feelings or this abused minor\u2019s feelings?

You said \"I grew up in an abusive life and I never want to inflict that onto my own kids or see it happen to anyone\u2026\" you learned how to do what you are doing because now you're the abusor and not the abused.  That's how easy it is. \n\n It's very arrogant thinking you can make these kind of decisions without you hearing something that you don't like or don't agree with.", ">We hadn\u2019t seen him in over 155 days.

It is your husbands. He needs to be doing all the work for communicating with schools, etc... I'm not sure what country you live in, but if the school is making it that hard to access your student's file, there are actions you can take against the school. Your husband needs to be the one to handle this. Way to often step parents believe the biological parent to be the victim when in fact the biological parent is just lazy.  Make sure you are not the one picking up dad's slack. \n\nSecond, being required to talk on the phone 2x a week and text 1x a day sounds like alot.  I don't know anyone in college who communicated with their parents that much. Those that were required to talk to their parents on a regular basis (ie every Sunday) didn't really want to. \n\nMost 17 year olds do not have work knowledge or a car. Thats something you just have to learn. \n\nYou do not need to know anything about college applications! That is your step-son's job. If he cannot apply to college on his own or figure out how to sign up for classes, then he WILL fail college. \n\nI do think its reasonable to not feel taken advantage of when you are giving someone this much money. These are just parts of your plan that might need to be modified.", "ESH, but I suspect it isn't Sean. And it's mostly his mom. She sounds abusive (regardless if the courts think otherwise) and it sounds like he is prioritizing his mental health living with her over contact with you, which is an upsetting situation but reasonable for a 17 year old boy. Offering to house him is a great idea, and you don't owe him money. But for the love of all that is holy, don't tell a 17 year old boy who is going through shit at home that you are buying his contact through an education. It probably reminds him of his situation with his mom. You can invite him to stay, see if he stays in contact, and then base a decision on offering money for education on behaviour after he is living with you based on your comfort at that time, without holding it over his head or making it feel like a bribe.", "NTA, but I'd definitely look into therapy with Sean.

BUT admit you\u2019re fearful of the fact that his lack of communication comes from his moms control, yet are blaming him. I get it must suck to never hear from him, but considering he wants to live with you guys you should already know how much you mean to him. You literally might be taking away any chance of a future this kid has because of his mom. I highly doubt that the kid you\u2019ve described legitimately just never wants to talk to you. It\u2019s his mom OP and you shouldn\u2019t be giving ultimatums when he likely doesn\u2019t even have the power at his moms to do what you\u2019re asking safely. You admit his mom wants him not to have an education so he can work with her so she can keep his money. You\u2019re playing right into his moms hands! this is exactly what she wants. She\u2019s limiting contact and because she is now you\u2019re going to take away any opportunity he truly has of a future. THAT is what makes you an unbelievably giant unempathetic AH.

I don\u2019t even mean just emotional pain I mean you\u2019re hurting his chances of being successful in life by doing so.

His mother sounds downright abusive, so I would not be surprised if she is not allowing him to communicate with you and his dad.

If you know his mother is awful and you moved hours away, he probably feels like you guys don\u2019t care. I am guessing a lot happens in those 155 days and he just doesn\u2019t want to have to discuss it. I live with my 14 yr, she stays in her room and barely responds to texts. It\u2019s what teenagers do. Our job as parents is to love them and give them guidance and space when needed. You don\u2019t owe him fully funded college.

You're putting all the blame on Sean for not communicating but you also say that his mother controls his phone. It's quite possible that the reason he texts her more often is because she forces him to. You say she's worse than a helicopter parent but you're the one who called the police on him four times. You're using your money to control him. Yes, he should contact you more regularly, but it's quite possible that he wasn't allowed to. And what happens if he does make friends and starts dating; if and when he starts socializing more, he won't be able to talk to you as much. You could agree that he calls you at least twice a week or something like that, but at the same time he should be given more freedom rather than be constantly wondering if you're going to withhold the money.

We will all look at this together and discuss. Thank you", "So he\u2019s pleading to the court to move in with you and you still think he doesn\u2019t like you/want to talk to you? My guess is there are more layers to his relationship with his mom than meets the eye. I understand that you just want the kid to talk to you. That does not make you an AH. But with this ultimatum of texting you a set amount, I just don\u2019t see how that\u2019s actually going to help him WANT to talk to you. Now he\u2019s going to feel put in a box and will likely only do the bare minimum, if at all, and I highly doubt he will be cool with it. Teenagers are sensitive, and I think your expectations don\u2019t line up with reality. What do you need to do is foster a relationship with him so that he comes to talk to you of his own free will. I think the mother is involved in why he doesn\u2019t text as often as he would like. There\u2019s gotta be more there. I also think a therapist could help you guys facilitate those conversations for you.", "[deleted]", "You're probably going to need to invest in a lot of therapy - for Sean, for yourselves, and for yall as a family. Sean to understand what he's been through, how it's affecting him, what's true and what isn't, and how to change his thinking and behavior. Yourselves to have a place to talk through your frustrations with someone who understands what you're up against and what Sean needs from parents, and for all of you to learn how to be a family made up of these specific people that supports each other, to create boundaries together, all that stuff. \n\nIt may also be helpful to put college money for him in a trust that you don't control, with parameters for Sean to access and use it, ideally controlled by a neutral 3rd party. That way the college money is neutralized as a weapon for everyone to use against each other. \n\nI work with homeless adults, and have seen so much of what happens when this stuff does NOT ever get addressed. It's not pretty. Good luck!", "That\u2019s the rub, we cannot do anything without her involvement except have private convos through text. Until he is with us and she has no say over him we cannot get therapy or anything else similar\u2026 I just want him to be happy and safe as he can be. No I don\u2019t think he hates us quite to the contrary he just hates the situation he is in.", "And yet you are still threatening him to force him to communicate.\n\nThis is stunningly self-centred.\n\nWhy not buy him a flip phone with a solar charger so he can be in control of communication. Or go back to court to enforce the agreement that you claim to have.\n\nWhat you describe here is an attempt to bully a child into defying their other bully.\n\nI really hope this is fake, because if it is real, no-one is looking out for this kid's interests.", "Look, just let him get through the months until he turns 18 and can move to you in any way he needs to. If that means communication is limited in those months, so be it. This kid sounds like he's stuck between 2 controlling mothers. Controlling in different ways, maybe, but he's still stuck. Let him know you'll always be there any time he needs day or night. Offer to buy him a phone, his mother can't access and make plans of how to support him when he can finally move to you. Beyond that, stop adding more stress, threats, and conditions on the poor kid. Carry on this way, and you will all end up losing him one way or another.", "That makes sense. Maybe he moves in and you just see how it goes with zero expectations. Best case scenario, he talks to you all the time. Worst case scenario that\u2019s some thing that you can sit down and have a conversation with him about.", "That\u2019s my hurt and I realize I didn\u2019t make this clear in my ask- when Sean is here as he is now it\u2019s open honest communication and laughter and gaming and total immersive involvement of our relationship as a family unit. It\u2019s wonderful and even a little white picket fence type. \n\nI just don\u2019t want him to feel like he can\u2019t have that with us when he IS NOT here and to only talk to us in person\u2026 there\u2019s so much we\u2019ve already missed out on"]}
