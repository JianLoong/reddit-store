And when the time comes that he his no longer with us, you anticipate sister's grief will be so overwhelming as to make mine - the person who has taken the time and pushed through the emotional toll of seeing his decline - insignificant? Do you think I don't have feelings or simply that mine don't matter? That **I** don't matter? Just because you see me as \"stronger\" than sis does not mean I exist just to hold her up or that I am incapable of breaking. We all have our limits and regardless of whether or not you think I'm worthy of such indulgence, I, too, must protect and even prioritize my own well being at times. For now, that means taking a break from your unreasonable expectations.\"", "NTA. You have to look out for yourself first. \n\nJust because your mam babies your sister, doesn't mean you have to, too. She's not your kid!", "NTA If you're expected to be there for your sister, who exactly is supposed to be there for you? Forget about her. Enjoy what time you have left with your grandpa. Take care of yourself. And if your sister needs someone then she already has your mom.", "nta. Why would your sister grieve when he passes away? He's dead to her NOW. \n\nSister just wants the prestige and sympathy of losing her grandfather. She's making it all about HER.\n\nBoth Mam and Sis suck.", "NTA. My great grandma suffered from many health issues, dementia being the last one to hit. It started off very small details she would forget, but eventually got to the point she couldn't even recognize her own kids and called for help when we would come visit. My grandma (her daughter) took full care of her and would get greatly upset with my dad for not visiting or making us visit too. But for my dad it was really tough, he grew up with my great grandma being the family rock pretty much. It devastated him when she would be frightened by us coming over, and he didn't want to stress her out. He still feels immense guilt for not going, but for him it just took a toll mentally.\nI can see your sisters view point, but I also see yours. For my grandma we made sure to support her as best we could when my great grandma passed, my dad also grieved but understood that it was his choice to not be there in the final days and put his feelings aside to be there for his mom. His guilt was not her problem, just like your sisters isn't yours.\nThis is her choice. While you'll both grieve, it won't be your job to manage your sisters guilt on top of it. I wish all the best for you. I understand how hard it can be sometimes. While happy for the time you have its hard not to miss the person they used to be.", "NTA. Everyone is grieving and you seem to be handling it the most healthy. That doesn\u2019t mean you should get her extra baggage thrown onto you. \n\nSuggestion: don\u2019t do or say anything you cannot undo or say. Especially while everyone is vulnerable. Clear boundaries (your edit) is a great idea. \n\nIt\u2019s ok to tell them you\u2019re hurting too and apologize for your side of the street. Don\u2019t expect her to reciprocate, but it will (edit *may*) make you feel better and likely add clarity. \u2764\ufe0f", "I was the last person to speak to my maternal grandmother. I visited my paternal grandmother a lot before her last stroke. It was awful seeing a body with none of her zeal. I didn\u2019t see either of them as much as I should have but I\u2019m glad for the time I spent with them. I\u2019d say it\u2019s above Reddit\u2019s paygrade though.", "NTA for the situation but YTA for using your ailing grandpa for internet clout, that's gross.", "NTA. I would understand what your mum says if your sister had been 10 or so. But at 22, your sister needs to start having some resiliency or she'll never make it on her own. I'm sure there's a gentle way to word this, but your sister needs to grow up... we all must face the death of loved ones - she doesn't get to be protected forever.", "So I don't know why your sister cut out your granddad, but I think it also probably doesn't matter in this circumstance.\nAs far as I understand your post, your sis cut out your granddad and says you posting about him is bad for her mental health. You say her cutting out your granddad is bad for your mental health. And your mum wants you to be there for your sister even though you don't seem to be on good speaking terms, if something happens to your granddad, did I understand that correctly?\nFirst up, your sister can block your content on social media or you can do that to her, e.g. set your Insta stories so she won't see them (you can do that in the settings without having to block her account).\nFor the grieving part, everyone grieves differently and you'll never know how you react, but I think if your mum is so worried about your sister's grieve she can deal with it if you don't feel up to talking to her, you mental health is not less important than your sisters.\n\nEdit: NTA for having boundaries and putting your mental health before your sister's.", "I wish someone had told me to look after myself in grief. My mom made my dads death a million times more difficult on me because her and everyone else relied on me to be her grief punching bag. I took it because I was basically a zombie at the time, and being emotionally and verbally abused by the one parent I had left. It destroyed me. It\u2019s been years and I\u2019m still messed up over it. It took away my self worth and confidence. I know I would have done much better if I put myself and my needs 1st a few times during those 1st years instead of letting her steamroll over me all the time.\n\nTake care of yourself, be kind to her but don\u2019t be a pushover or a punching bag. You are absolutely correct - don\u2019t hurt yourself to help her. A quote I see here  often is \u201cdon\u2019t set yourself on fire to keep others warm\u201d.", "This is a good call. If seeing your posts hurts so much she can unfollow you", "You work on your mental health, she can work on hers, but it's never reasonable to ask you to sacrifice your wellbeing for hers, block her from your SM, that solves that issue, maybe take some time away from her and your mam until they can get their proverbial heads out of their arses, other than that, as long as you're not burning someone else down to keep yourself warm, you're doing just fine.", "NTA. You're a strong person dealing with reality.  Let her live with her choices", "NTA \n\nBlock your sister from social media, it annoys me when cry babies try to control what to post \n\nYour mom is causing problems. Saying she would get hurt more. Huh? Who even says that? Don\u2019t let her comments get to you and do your own thing. \n\nIf you all need to comfort each other that\u2019s understandable but they\u2019re not entitled to your support. It comes naturally. In fact, by what you wrote I can tell that you will be impacted the most. Where are they getting at?\n\nMy advice, even if you\u2019re not asking for any is to not entertain your mom and sisters opinions. They\u2019re weird. Keep seeing your grandpa and enjoy him to the fullest. \n\nWish him so much more time. Best wishes", "WTF is it with these PARENTS on here demanding their children take care of THEM and their SIBLINGS?!? These folks are toxic AF. NTA, OP. Not at all.", "You're such a good person, and NTA. I wish I'd have been able to visit my grandpa even once a month when he was suffering from dementia, but distance and cost were a factor. Treasure the time you do have.", "I may have to use that one time if she brings it up again", "How am I using him for Internet clout? Whatever that is? \nWe (me and him) made the account several years beforehand so he could stay in touch with his Canadian family. It is a private account and only have family on. He gets to see what they are up to and vice versa, as well as video chat with them.  I always ask his permission before taking or posting a pic and will never do so without it.", "Sis cutting him out isn't bad for my mental health I just don't agree with but I respected her boundaries and blocked her from my accounts, all of them as she constantly likes to have an opinion on my life - about how I dress, my weight, moving out of thw parental home, my new flat, my bf. All of that is bad for my mental health and that's why I blocked her. But thank you for your reply to my post\nI try with boundaries they (mam &sis) just don't care for them and think having boundaries means I have something to hide.", "Yeah, I'm sorry, I've read some of your responses to others and sounds like your sister is a narcissist and your mum is enabling her.\nFor your own mental health try to keep those boundaries up as much as possible and go low contact with them.\n\nIf you ever physically have to be in the same location as them tell them you'll leave whenever they start with things you've expressed your boundaries over. E.g. at a family gathering move to another room.\nDon't answer their calls and block them. Put them on an information diet and give them time outs, e.g. you berated me about my looks, so I'm now not speaking to you for 2 weeks.\n\nYou've got this.", "Suspect your sister\u2019s problem with your visits is yours are on social media leaving her absence of visits very public.", "Soft ESH. It\u2019s really hard to go through the grieving process with someone who is still alive, and everyone handles it differently- while I don\u2019t agree with your sisters approach, I wouldn\u2019t use it arsenal to not be a sister to her when your grandfather dies.\n\nIn terms of posting IG videos of your grandpa\u2026 I\u2019m not sure your sisters reasoning is the reason you should stop. Also, I do think it\u2019s rather selfish that she doesn\u2019t visit, especially when it sounds like y\u2019all live close to his retirement home. But \u2026 I\u2019m also not sure you should be publicly posting videos of a person who, due to their dementia, is not able to give their informed approval. If the videos are just for you, and not for the general public, then I dunno what purpose posting them even serves?", "NTA!!!!!\n\nMy mother passed early this year and I already knew that I had to deal with the  financial side of the funeral as I was her 'banker' and I was the go to person for much of her doctor visits although I am the youngest of 6 children. When I was told that I had to be strong for 'the others' I answered a loud 'Nope!', I spent the most time with her so I would miss her more. I told them that if everyone collapsed I was going to collapse  as well. Let yourself grieve over missing the relationship. Much of your sister's grief will be as a result of guilt and regret.", "NTA.  Have been where you are.  I am thankful to have those memories as sometimes got the person to laugh and talk about different things.  Your sister can block you on social media.  Tell your mom if she doesn\u2019t like it she can block it.", "NTA", "I love that I have pictures of my great grandmother and grandfather when she was in full blown Alzheimer\u2019s and my grandfather is early stage dementia. I love that i got to spend time with them both. My aunt refused to have anything to do with either of them and then wailed like a child to get attention during it. It was infuriating (she was also very spoiled and it hasn\u2019t gone well for her as an older adult). \n\nYou\u2019re doing what works for you. You shouldn\u2019t also have to have the burden of your sisters indifference and it is rude of your mom to expect you too.", "Hammered into your head by who? Why would you have to \"be strong\" for your mother? This all sounds performative from your sister. She clearly just wants your attention.", "NTA. Secure your own oxygen mask first. Sis can unfollow you or even just stop opening the app in question entirely. You'll probably be glad you have those photos and videos when he's gone. She has steps she can take without asking anything of you, she just refuses to.", "NTA, you need to do what's best for your mental health and she really doesn't have to look. You're allowed to post what you want on your social media cuz it's not wronging the person in those videos.\n\nLike your sister choosing to cut him off it's her choosing not to be family with him, why would you then serve as her emotions later when she's choosing not to care? And also why is your mom so bent on everything working for your sister? Why would you play into the dynamic of her being favored? It sounds like you should have radio silence with them since they are a little team", "Why will she need you?  She doesn't have a relationship with him. To her, he's been dead since dementia set in."]}
