After she forgot who I was, I still kept going because I brightened her day a little bit.\n\nWe will never know the impact of my visits to my aunt, or your visits to your grandad, if any.  What we do know is that we can brighten their days a bit.  Your sister could be doing the same but chooses not to.

I hope you can keep the good memories and understand that visiting him is huge.  Good luck and God bless.", "Nta. Your sister sounds very self centered. Not wanting to visit someone with dementia is understandable - It's hard to see someone you love that way. But to demand you stop posting things because it upsets her? No. You got it right - she can just not look. She wants to pretend your grandad is already gone. You don't owe her support when it really happens.", "NTA.

So they\u2019re saying that your sister, who cut out your grandpa because seeing him is bad for her mental health, will be allowed to grieve uncontrollably and it\u2019ll be okay because you\u2019ll be there to support her & be strong? Like you don\u2019t get to grieve? That\u2019s really selfish and presumptuous of them. Your sister is a grown adult.

I personally think the photos you take of your grandfather should be private and not available to anyone but you, but not my decision. Your sister, however, is getting a little old for mum to still consider her the baby-waby who must be treated so special because she\u2019s too emotionally immature to act like an adult. Her grief will not be greater than yours even if there is guilt mixed in with it that she was too weak/mentally fragile to even visit her grandfather.

That's what my therapist said when we were waiting for my grandpa's death, I mentioned I was worried about handling my mother's grief. It basically means you cant run yourself on empty to ensure someone else is full. I'm sort of similar to your sister, I have distanced myself from ailing relatives because taking on all those extra emotions would likely cause me to crumble.

You don\u2019t owe your sister anything and you\u2019re an amazing grandchild", "NTA, I\u2019m so sick of people trying make family members responsible for full grown, able bodied adults.

Does your granddad understand what you're doing? Out of respect for him you might reconsider at least the videos. Even if it's \"good\" days. Also, everyone reacts differently to a relative getting sick with a disease that changes their personality and some will (like your sister) have a really hard time seeing them.
