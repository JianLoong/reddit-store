Something like this would be grandfathered in many jurisdictions, and updates would only be required under certain circumstances. For example, we bought a duplex that was like this. The bank obviously required insurance, and no insurance company would insure us until the circuit panels were accessible by their respective units.  In our case, we were allowed to put the questionable one directly outside of where it was at the time.\n\nBut if we had paid cash and didn't want insurance, the city wouldn't have required the update because it was grandfathered under a previous code.", "There\u2019s always legal exceptions of which this would count.", "This is so ignorant", "Wtf, how is this OPs fault.  No one should have to live like this.  This house is almost certainly not up to code.  This is slum lord shit.  No one should have to run a extension cord through their kitchen for a week", "@Massive-Isopod9452 Fortunately I had a 3 prong extension, but not long enough to make it from the living room, so I had to extend further with a power bar. Extension cord was a recent purchase so I was able to check if it met guidelines (it\u2019s a bit under, \u201cmedium duty\u201d), and the power bar is old so I have no clue what it\u2019s rated for. I work from home so I\u2019m keeping an eye on things.\n\nI can\u2019t see purchasing a better extension cord to keep my kitchen jerry rigged when really, in any normal apartment this should not be an issue. The landlord needs to hire someone like you to fix it (but they really don\u2019t care, they are really bad about fixing things.)", "Tenants rarely have an absolute right to refuse entry by the landlord - it usually includes a period of notice, a degree of reasonableness for the reason, what the lease specifies, and what the local laws are. \n\nThere is nothing in the original post about location, so I would be very hesitant to say that \"the neighbour has the right to refuse entry to the landlord\" because there are plenty of jurisdictions where that is not the case. \n\nEither way, that is a discussion for the neighbour and the landlord, OP is NTA for asking for landlord to reestablish power in their apartment.", "NTA. \nI am required to give 24 hrs notice, but certain circumstances allow me to enter with less or no warning (water leaking, gas leaking, power problem, which is the case here, heating problem. Reasonable belief that giv8ng 24 hr notice will allow tenant time to hide something illegal or against the lease like having an unauthorized occupant or pet, etc). Where I live, the landlord absolutely can tell the tenant they are entering to resolve an issue.  The landlord has an obligation to provide an apartment that is habitable, which means they have all power safely turned on. If I were the landlord, I'd run wires to move the box either outside or into the correct unit, though.", "No it isn\u2019t. Even the most tenant friendly states have exceptions in cases of emergency, permission/reasonable notice isn\u2019t required. Yes you can\u2019t just say \u201cI want to come in in 5 minutes to measure your windows for new blinds\u201d. But you can absolutely enter because you need access to provide necessities such as power to other units.", "Yeah, it doesn\u2019t work that way. Emergency repairs supersede all other rights of the tenant. It\u2019s not reasonable to suggest otherwise. The OP is entitled to electricity in his unit, without it he has no access to the refrigerator. I guess he could just set the building on fire with an extension cord.", "OP seems to be Canadian and Canada doesn't have states", "I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s his fault, but clearly not worth ruining a relationship with downstairs tenant over easy fix for a few days.

Common ground , could be getting owner to buy extension cord in case this happens again , until he gets electrician in . Getting wires from downstairs to upstairs will be the challenge and will impact you for a few days (cutting out drywall and drilling studs) which should be done, but we see this a lot in older houses.  Landlord should buy you proper extension cord in case you trip circuit again and basement tenant is out . Try to not use a power bar \ud83d\udc4d Good luck", "However, legally it would be very easy to argue that the unit has power. Only a certain breaker is out. This is not an emergency.", "It does dependent on the state. OP has electricity, a breaker is simply out and does not constitute an emergency, so dependent on tenet laws within whichever state they are in, they could prevent them or later sue them.", "Is OP really?  I was thinking this sounds EXACTLY like my uncles old Victorian house in Toronto.  The units, not the bad kitchen wiring.  Location and architecture were both enviable.", "They didn't lie.  They googled it and aren't an electrician.  In most US states the landlord has the right to enter the building with proper notice.  The neighbor not wanting the landlord to enter the property when they know the circuit breaker is in their apt, not OPs fault.", "Uhm no, the kitchen is out. Having a functional kitchen, heat and working bathroom are generally the three things that a landlord is legally obligated to fix within 24 hours. Some states have even more utilities that are required to be fixed.", "Using an extension cord for major appliances is a fire hazard to the entire building. But likely something the landlord needs to give notice for and not just I am popping in to switch the breaker. It should be in a common area or landlord accessible if for the entire building though", "His refrigerator is out, his food will spoil and will be without food for a week. That is an emergency. Whatever meth lab situation is going on in the tenant\u2019s unit is now going to be exposed, I guess. Good luck in court.", "Terrible logic. By this, I could literally flip all the breakers to the build8ng except one and say the building has electricity.  The electricity isn't just that. It's the landlord must provide safe electricity as required by code. If a breaker is off, they are in violation of that.", "I get both sides, but having proper rights for a owner to enter the property while you are home is a lot different then having an owner enter your property when you are not even around. The tenant doesn\u2019t have a chance to be around , which is why I can see the basement tenants side. Either way the landlord should buy a proper extension cord until Electrician is hired. Also , if OP goes against wishes of downstairs tenant , I can guarantee you next time breaker is tripped it will take wayyyyyyyy longer to get turned back on , not sure if it\u2019s worth that hassle alone .", "Again, as you said, it is dependent on the state.", "Dependent on the state, county, and court. That doesn\u2019t not constitute an emergency.", "Purely off that logic, if one breaker is working then the building has electricity. The building is not fully functional nor has it everywhere, but it does have electricity. A drop in a glass still means that the glass is not empty.", "Whether or not it is worth it to piss off the neighbor is up for OP to decide.  But they aren't an AH if they want electricity in the kitchen of the apartment they rent.  Landlords need access to their building, if the neighbor is growing weed or has drugs out on the table they should have thought about that before they left.  The proper notice thing doesn't require the tenant to be there or give permission in most instances.", "I\u2019m pretty familiar with landlord and tenant laws. Find me this state that you think prevents a landlord from entering a residence in the case of an emergency. \n\nAnd California is 100% NOT one of those states. Send proof. I\u2019ll wait, because I know for a fact there isn\u2019t one.", "An emergency for a landlord in California is flooding or fire, both of which are not happening.", "https://dcba.lacounty.gov/portfolio/landlord-entering-your-unit/#:~:text=Your%20landlord%20can%20enter%20your,%2C%20tenants%2C%20or%20repair%20workers.\n\nThis would be California. They are able to enter with 24 hours notice, regardless, and with no notice if there\u2019s an emergency/ a risk of property damage, which this would be.\n\nEmergency is not defined as JUST flood or fire. You are wrong.the law is intentionally vague because the idea that the only time you may need to enter an apartment urgently can be rigidly defined is a bad precedent.", "It\u2019s vague enough where someone losing partial power in a different unit can also be argued as a non emergency. This is also the county of LA btw"]}
