It was a pain in the ass for me (hence I sold the place and moved), but it's the cost of living in a basement.", "This isn't a maintenance visit that requires 24 hours notice, OP has no power to their fridge, it is an emergency visit & the LL has legal right to enter to fix this in such situations.\n\nI am a landlord and have read up on such situations after getting pushback from a tenant.", "Thanks, I have a call in to the local tenant assistance line, as this is not the only issue with the unit (unsurprisingly.)", "Wild guess, but no, that\u2019s not where I\u2019m at. \ud83e\udd79", "So the landlord does not need the tenant's permission, but he does have to give notice to the tenant of upcoming maintenance that needs to be done, either to the apartment itself or because of needing access to the apartment for maintenance done to another apartment.  Yes, tenants have a right to privacy, but when you are renting a space from someone else, you do not get to be the end all-be all decision maker of the owner entering your space because at the end of the day, it is not \"your\" home.", "Thanks, I\u2019ll pass this along. They made it sound like it would be a big deal.", "The breaker is not broken. It's doing its job. This person has way too much power running on one circuit. A microwave and air fryer take a lot of power and it sounds like his fridge is the same circuit as well.", ">you suck more for making a bigger problem then it is.\n\nNot having any electricity in your kitchen is a pretty big fucking deal.", "Yeh wtf what if OP needs to cut the power?? We had a big flood and that was the first thing we had to do.", "The house isn\u2019t up to code", "In most of the world, but the US views it's population as cash cows to be milked so who knows \ud83e\udd37", "I used to live in a house that was wired like that. I don't think it had been updated since the 60s. This was in the 2000s.\n\nWhen it was bought by new owners, they tore it down.", "The Netherlands is a country built around working together to steal land from the ocean, there's no such thing as individual rights to benefit from society to which you don't contribute.\n\nBasically, doe normaal!", "You are absolutely right about both the building and landlord being shady.  I\u2019m retired from my city\u2019s Planning Department and we had to deal with this stuff all the time.  People would illegally subdivide their single family structure into multiple units, and wouldn\u2019t get the Building Department to review the changes because they knew it wouldn\u2019t pass inspection.  We got involved when they tried to sell the property and the buyer\u2019s underwriter would want a letter from Planning verifying that the buyer could have the same use of the property if the structure was destroyed and had to be rebuilt.  They needed to know that the property was worth it\u2019s price because multiple units cost more than a single unit.  Of course, the answer was no because both the use and structure were illegal in the zone.  I made that determination and got threatened by property owners on a regular basis.", "To be honest, if I was the neighbour, my thought process would be entirely \"oh god, we left the place a bomb site after we packed for this trip and I'm embarrassed for anyone else to see it. It really needs a vacuum. There's a bra on the sofa. I think I left the box of condoms on the sink.\"\n\nI wouldn't refuse entry because of it, but I would definitely be groaning internally and wishing they found another workaround.", "You know, suspect is a real word and uses just as many letters.", "Correct. Most places only require buildings be brought up to code as part of a major renovation/reconstruction (i.e., OP burns the building down running their fridge off an extension cord). OP\u2019s landlord should absolutely upgrade the sketchy wiring, but they are (likely) in the clear legally not to do so. \n\nI live in a condo that was converted from apartments that were built in the \u201870s and the HOA requires us to have a rider in our HOI policies to cover the cost of bringing our units up to code in the event of a major fire or something similar.", "Pretty much the only places it wouldn't be legal for the landlord to enter in order to reactivate power to another unit, are the places where this house would not legally be rentable due to the set up and clearly not up to standard electrical circuits.\n\nSo either, it's entirely legal for the landlord to enter for this, or all people in that unit are about to get a huge settlement from a tenancy board/tribunal.", "I say \"consider\" because the riskiness of doing so depends on what protections exist for renters where OP lives and how bent on retaliation their landlord is. Once OP is out of that place, there is absolutely zero reason not to report.", "Ha, very unsurprising. Good luck!", "It could be. Depending on where you live, sometimes just calling in an electrician to do work on an outdated electrical panel triggers a requirement to bring it up to code.", "You need to get rid of the power bar. Get an extension cord with a 12 or lower wire gauge.", "exactly this. the 2020 NEC requires the power panel to be accessible (read: not behind a locked door) by the person living in the dwelling.", "That's the issue here. The building clearly isn't up to code and that's down to the landlord, not OP. OP totally NTA for wanting to have a functioning kitchen and not being willing to wait until the basement dwellers are back in town.\n\nI don't know the laws around landlords entering premises without the tenants permission but surely if there's a necessary repair or something? Doesn't that trump needing permission? If OP's bathtub overflowed and was flooding the basement, sure the tenants would be furious if it was left to sit til they got home, no?", "You never know what will happen though. The roof collapsed in my apartment while I was at work and I wasn\u2019t allowed back in. A moving company that specialized in this type of thing salvaged what they could, boxed it up, and when I finally had a new place delivered it there.  They absolutely labeled a box \u201cnude pics and sex toys\u201d (think polaroids. This was the early aughts) and asked me where I wanted it. \n\nIt takes a lot to embarrass me, and under normal circumstances I would\u2019ve thought it was funny.  It would\u2019ve been the laugh I needed in a really stressful situation.  \n\nExcept they handed it to me in front of my dad. When I mumbled something about them probably getting the contents of my apartment confused with a neighbor\u2019s, the guy said, \u201cNo. It was definitely you.\u201d It\u2019s one of those things that happened, and my father and I pretend it didn\u2019t. \n\nEven if they have a dungeon down there, the landlord has probably seen it before.  Thanks to the internet, there\u2019s very little we haven\u2019t seen before.  It\u2019s only a thing if you make it one.", "It's almost like language evolves.", "> suspect is a real word and uses just as many letters.\n\nSuspish is short for suspicious. I think they used a slang version of suspicious.", "Accessible power box may be required for individual unit in some areas. Same with water shutoffs", ">Most places only require buildings be brought up to code as part of a major renovation/reconstruction (i.e., OP burns the building down running their fridge off an extension cord).\n\nYou can rent something that is not up to code?", "IMO there is always an emergency clause in the laws about entering a tenant's residency. Ours is 48 hours warning from them if I'm not requesting it, or emergencies.", "It\u2019s usually 25 hr written notice. You don\u2019t have to be there, when the landlord goes in.", "Sadly, yes. Existing structures are typically grandfathered in and only need to be updated during renovation/reconstruction. Most rentals (in the US at least) would not be occupied otherwise. The time it would take to make updates and such would be considered a burden on the owner and frankly on local electricians/plumbers or whatnot.", "You're either being sarcastic or being very naive.  This is where the term 'slumlord' usually comes into play.\n\nI actually live in a similar situation to OP.  The downstairs neighbour DOES NOT have a problem with the landlord going in and resetting the breaker if it happens in our place while he's gone.  He gets it 100%.\n\nAnd no we don't rent from a slumlord, but the city we live in is notorious for upping the taxes to the limit for bs reasons just to get the cash.", "What if OP had NO power? Are they supposed to just sit around and wait for their neighbor to come home in a week or so?", "If you have faulty electricity.....FIRES can erupt, which could lead to eventual  flooding... you have NO IDEA what you are babbling about. Faulty electricity is definitely an EMERGENCY."]}
