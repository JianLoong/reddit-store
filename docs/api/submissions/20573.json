But, unfortunately, that will limit your relationships. It will limit the closeness and intimacy you can build. \n\nSo: I really encourage you to find a really good therapist who focuses on attachment and developmental trauma. \n\nAnd I encourage you to cut your father off unless and until he can treat you like an adult. \n\nYou having these conversations and then coming back the next week only teaches him that he can be as invasive as he wants and the only consequence is an uncomfortable convo. That is well worth the price for him, as evidenced by the fact he keeps doing it. \n\nHe\u2019s not going to stop, you need to refuse him access. \n\nNTA", "NTA but stop visiting him every weekend.

It's never okay for someone to track and control a grown adult like this.\n\nAt a minimum, do not go visit your father for many weeks.\n\nIn the US you could file a police report for this behavior.  Some places would just file the paper, some would call him and tell him to knock it off, and some would arrest him unless you asked them not to.  Feel free to point out to him that what he did is stalking, and that you'll call the police if he does anything like that again.  I suggest texting him that since it will be easier for you to tell him what you need to that way.  Tell him not to try to contact you.  That you need a break from him and if/when you're ready to talk to him you'll initiate contact.\n\nThen set the ringtone on his contact to silent, put your phone face down in another room and go do something you enjoy.  It's better than actually blocking him, because you can collect his voice marks and text messages in case you need proof of what he's doing.\n\nAlternatively, you can just block him, which makes it easier not to think about him.", "NTA - No, you're not overreacting.  It's a massive breach of trust and privacy.  How often does your dad do things like this?\n\nIf I were in your position I would go low contact until he learns to respect small boundaries from a distance.  Honestly, this behaviour would scare the shit of me.", "Unsurprisingly there's a lot of \"go NC noooooowwww\" on the thread. If you wanted to do this, it would certainly be justified, but I think it's a lot more difficult and painful to do in practice than is assumed on this sub. I don't think it should be step #1 here.\n\nI suspect your dad can't cope with his own anxiety about something bad happening to you, and so he outsources that anxiety on to you by trying to control your behaviour. The fact that you have to ask whether objecting to a tag on your car makes you a bad person suggests you're struggling to define your boundaries with your father. His behaviour is unacceptable but when you have a parent like this they condition you to feel guilty about upsetting them even when their behaviour has upset you. Talking to him about this is a waste of time. I imagine you have this fantasy that if you could just find the right words he would get it and act like a normal parent. But he won't. The only thing you can do to change the situation is change your own behaviour.\n\nNTA but I think some therapy for yourself would help and I'd also recommend a book called \"adult children of emotionally immature parents\".

As a matter of fact, if he's been in your home, you need to check the house for hidden cameras and listening devices. No matter what kind of anxiety issues he has, he can seek professional help for them and not burden you with his dysfunction. That is beyond creepy and controlling.", "Nope nuh uh, girl. No. You need to grow a backbone.\n\nMy dad took a brunt of the child rearing with me. But I have NEVER been obligated to do any of these things. I visit him once a month at best and call once a week. I call him more when I want to talk to him. Usually to let him know what both of us are up to.\n\nThese are things he is totally fine with and he has never ONCE resorted to tracking me with an AirTag. You need to set boundaries:\n\n1) For the AirTag, don\u2019t visit your dad for a month. He should not be tracking a 32 year old woman.\n\n2) after that month, visits will be MONTHLY, if that, but under new rules:\n\n- he seeks out therapy as to why he feels these extremes are necessary.\n\n- if he ever plants an AirTag or other tracking device on you or your vehicle again you will be going to the police, as this stealth tracking is typical of stalkers.\n\nGrow yourself a backbone.

You are an adult and he has no business doing this.\n\nOf course, I'm passive agressive, so I would have put that on an interstate truck at a highway stop", "YTA. Your 32 years old!! Why are you still  vitiating your father weekly and even allowing him to treat you this way?! Ridiculous!!!", "OP may think her father \u2018means well\u2019 but he doesn\u2019t - he\u2019s selfishly letting his anxieties rule her life. And what is this nonsense about having to go home every weekend? Does he not want you to have friends or date ever?\n\nGood parents want what\u2019s best for their kids. This\u2026 is not that. This is controlling and one day you\u2019re going to wake up with no friends, no romantic partner, no life of your own and your dad will have you all to himself.", "32!!! That\u2019s wild. I thought maybe 20 and just living in their own\u2026\n\nOP - do you come from a culture where it\u2019s unusual for adult children/daughters to move out in their own before marriage? That is really the only situation I can see where this would not be WILDLY creepy and wrong, though it would Stop be creepy and overbearing. \n\nYou are 32 and fused to visit every weekend and being tracked. That didn\u2019t sound like anxiety that sounds like high control. \n\nRemove the tag, and then cut out your visits for a little while and tell him \n\n\u201cThis was hugely inappropriate and a big boundary crossed, and now I don\u2019t feel comfortable visiting you because I can\u2019t trust you not to invade my privacy again. So I\u2019ll be taking a break from our visits and will talk to you in a month or two about visiting again once I decide how much access to my life I want to give you until I can trust you again.\u201d\n\nAnd then follow through. Don\u2019t fold. And talk to other friends your age, find out how often they actually visit their parents and what they think about the AirTag incident. \n\nIt sounds to me like your dad has been crossing boundaries and using manipulation and control for so long in your life that it\u2019s so normalized this isn\u2019t as big a deal to you as it is to the rest of us. Which makes me think you need to hear what a bunch of other people think of your dad and his expectations to start to identify what\u2019s ok and not ok from him.", "Didn\u2019t the husband post something just like this today?", "Exactly!\n\nOP, I'd start by following your instinct to disappear and not to contact him until you feel better. Then you might want to extend that period until he sincerely apologizes. Maybe somewhere in there, if you feel like it, send him a message about how violated this makes you feel and that you won't contact him until x / for a while.\n\nGood luck!", "Interstate 18 wheeler.", "This is the truth.  He doesn\u2019t deserve a weekly visit if he can\u2019t apologize sincerely for trying to control you.  And make amends.  Even if he does, you don\u2019t need to visit him every weekend unless you actually want to.", "It isn't unusual for Asian parents to helicopter and stalk their kids their entire lives.\n\nNTA. I am guessing Dad also crosses boundaries in other ways that are also inappropriate and unacceptable.", "I'm so sad that she already confronted him. The best way to handle this is to toss the tracking device into an open boxcar on a train leaving the state. Let him think you're riding the rails, hobo-style.", "This is brilliant! And hilarious!", "No, no, no. And I say this with all sincerity, please seek professional help. Your children should not have to find a way to accommodate your psychological disorder if it is invading their privacy and interfering with their autonomy as adults. If you feel this anxious, then you need to figure out a way to deal with it.", "Go home and put it on his car.  Text and ask him what he\u2019s doing, where he\u2019s going and what time he expects to be home.  Keep this up for a couple of weeks and it will drive the point home!", "this is super bizarre behavior. what is this about? why is he so anxious? \n\nhe needs mental help, clearly.", "This is the best advice.", "I totally agree and would add to make the boundaries very clear and concrete.  My children set \" we will take 6 months off this time.  If it happens again,  it will be a matter of years if not permanent.\"  (Their dad, not me!). They stuck to their word and it had a positive result.", "\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f", "Yeah I'm a 30+ with a helicopter parent, thankfully they wouldn't go this far....\n\nNow I'm going to check my car.", "What he's doing - refusing to respect boundaries and criminally stalking his daughter - is harmful by its very definition.", "He means to control her and allow her no privacy for the sake of his own anxieties. \n\nHe\u2019s almost certainly not sitting there saying \u201cand now I\u2019ll harm my daughter\u201d but he is taking actions that he knows harms her relationship with him and sense of well-being\u2014because she\u2019s told him this over and over.", "Don't. She could be arrested for that.", "I agree it is harmful and an absolute disregard of boundaries- my hang up was on the implication of intent in his actions.", "I see what you\u2019re saying. I agree she was hurt and that this is controlling. I like to save my cold-turkey cut-contact suggestions for when I think someone would benefit more, long term, by not having that person in their life anymore. If his intent was to hurt her, I would be ready to make that suggestion. But if he\u2019s capable of changing and understanding WHY this crosses so many lines, I\u2019d rather suggest a chance at redemption first.", "Even if he tells himself it comes from a noble place, a specific and targeted desire to control someone is malicious intent.", "Life is much easier if you judge actions and not intentions. People can do the most heinous things under the guise of good intentions.", "Intent never changes the nature of actions. Intent is a personal fiction, often written after the fact.", "Daughter told father his controlling actions bother her, as she states at end of her post. He responded by attaching a tracking device to her car.   \n\n\nAnd the steps involved in that-- researching a device, making the purchase, getting a damn magnet to attach it to, putting thought into what place to affix it in order to evade daughter's notice-- are truly sick. This is a man who does not recognise his daughter's autonomy at all, and when you don't recognise autonomy, harm is inevitable.", "Absolutely agree! I\u2019ve been floored by some of the things people do \u201cbecause they thought they were doing the right thing\u201d or \u201cthey were trying to help\u201d and there are some actions, regardless of intent, that don\u2019t deserve redemption. I do think it\u2019s okay to let intent be a factor in some situations, though.", "I agree that it doesn\u2019t change the nature of actions, but I disagree on the point of intent being fiction- if we write off intent 100% of the time and assume every person who did something bad is a bad person, nobody would have anybody. \n\nI\u2019ve been forgiven for things, I think it\u2019s important to differentiate between who deserves a second chance. How else do we make that distinction if we can\u2019t take intent into account?", "It's okay to factor in, but if we're using this case as an example the father is still in the wrong. Think of it this way, if his intentions were so good, why did he go out of his way to hide the Airtag? If he is doing nothing wrong, why secretly spy on his daughter? He knew what he was doing was wrong, that's why. His intent was to do something wrong and hopefully not get caught and he is trying to justify doing something wrong with his feelings.", "Of course, specifics do matter. But people tend to get too caught up in people's justifications and they start overshadowing the raw effects of their actions.", "He did indeed hide the AirTag which is a good technical point and I don\u2019t really have a good rebuttal for you. \n\nAITA questions like this are the harder ones imo- I don\u2019t like to suggest that someone cut someone out. I have to really be convinced."]}
