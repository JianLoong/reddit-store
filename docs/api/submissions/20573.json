It will limit the closeness and intimacy you can build. \n\nSo: I really encourage you to find a really good therapist who focuses on attachment and developmental trauma. \n\nAnd I encourage you to cut your father off unless and until he can treat you like an adult. \n\nYou having these conversations and then coming back the next week only teaches him that he can be as invasive as he wants and the only consequence is an uncomfortable convo.

It's never okay for someone to track and control a grown adult like this.\n\nAt a minimum, do not go visit your father for many weeks.\n\nIn the US you could file a police report for this behavior.  Some places would just file the paper, some would call him and tell him to knock it off, and some would arrest him unless you asked them not to.  Feel free to point out to him that what he did is stalking, and that you'll call the police if he does anything like that again.  I suggest texting him that since it will be easier for you to tell him what you need to that way.  Tell him not to try to contact you.  That you need a break from him and if/when you're ready to talk to him you'll initiate contact.\n\nThen set the ringtone on his contact to silent, put your phone face down in another room and go do something you enjoy.  It's better than actually blocking him, because you can collect his voice marks and text messages in case you need proof of what he's doing.\n\nAlternatively, you can just block him, which makes it easier not to think about him.", "NTA - No, you're not overreacting.  It's a massive breach of trust and privacy.  How often does your dad do things like this?\n\nIf I were in your position I would go low contact until he learns to respect small boundaries from a distance.  Honestly, this behaviour would scare the shit of me.", "Unsurprisingly there's a lot of \"go NC noooooowwww\" on the thread. If you wanted to do this, it would certainly be justified, but I think it's a lot more difficult and painful to do in practice than is assumed on this sub. I don't think it should be step #1 here.\n\nI suspect your dad can't cope with his own anxiety about something bad happening to you, and so he outsources that anxiety on to you by trying to control your behaviour. The fact that you have to ask whether objecting to a tag on your car makes you a bad person suggests you're struggling to define your boundaries with your father. His behaviour is unacceptable but when you have a parent like this they condition you to feel guilty about upsetting them even when their behaviour has upset you. Talking to him about this is a waste of time. I imagine you have this fantasy that if you could just find the right words he would get it and act like a normal parent. But he won't. The only thing you can do to change the situation is change your own behaviour.\n\nNTA but I think some therapy for yourself would help and I'd also recommend a book called \"adult children of emotionally immature parents\".

As a matter of fact, if he's been in your home, you need to check the house for hidden cameras and listening devices. No matter what kind of anxiety issues he has, he can seek professional help for them and not burden you with his dysfunction. That is beyond creepy and controlling.", "Nope nuh uh, girl. No. You need to grow a backbone.\n\nMy dad took a brunt of the child rearing with me. But I have NEVER been obligated to do any of these things. I visit him once a month at best and call once a week. I call him more when I want to talk to him. Usually to let him know what both of us are up to.\n\nThese are things he is totally fine with and he has never ONCE resorted to tracking me with an AirTag. You need to set boundaries:\n\n1) For the AirTag, don\u2019t visit your dad for a month. He should not be tracking a 32 year old woman.\n\n2) after that month, visits will be MONTHLY, if that, but under new rules:\n\n- he seeks out therapy as to why he feels these extremes are necessary.\n\n- if he ever plants an AirTag or other tracking device on you or your vehicle again you will be going to the police, as this stealth tracking is typical of stalkers.\n\nGrow yourself a backbone.

I have to really be convinced.", "NTA\n\nYou are *under*reacting. Your father is not overprotective; he is overbearing. You're 32, you've been an adult for 14 years. If this weren't done by your immediate family it'd be broadly considered stalking and would be a slam-dunk case for a restraining order.\n\nI would strongly recommend getting some therapy and going low-contact if not no-contact altogether. It's very clear that your father does not respect your autonomy, boundaries, or you as a whole -- he *refused to tell you where he planted it even after being called out.* He will continue to disrespect everything about you and overstep boundaries until he's shown that there are lasting consequences for his actions, that you are the only one who gets to decide when those consequences have run their course, and whether or not he is afforded your forgiveness and/or a second chance.\n\nThe reason I recommend therapy because you're obviously shaken up and conflicted about this. A trained professional is perfect for helping you navigate an event like this and it's what they're meant for. Other comments will suggest that you may have repressed trauma but that's something to think about after the current situation has been navigated -- and more importantly after you are in a place where you feel safe and comfortable to explore that, if at all.\n\nLastly on a personal note I have been in a situation with my father that's fairly similar to what you're going through. I went no-contact with him by sending him a text telling him what he did wrong, what he put me through, what I am feeling, why he made me feel that way, and the next steps. I outlined that he would not be the one to contact me -- I would contact him if and when I was ready. **He continued to contact me** because just like your situation this is an issue with a lack of respect. I'm still going through this and I'll have to evaluate how much longer that I'll refuse to allow him a foothold in my life, but the important thing is that I call the shots here. The same is true with you: you are the one to call the shots when it comes to your life. Your father has proven through his actions that he doesn't share that belief.\n\nBe strong, stand up for yourself, keep your boundaries firm, and no matter what demand the respect you are due.

It should be that person\u2019s decision though.", "> the kids were the \"multi thousand dollar investment\"! \n\nThey're certainly a mult-thousand dollar black hole \ud83d\ude04", "Just because the tech didn\u2019t exist doesn\u2019t make it less useful. \n\nSeat belts weren\u2019t a thing until the 60s and weren\u2019t required until the 80s. \n\nDid people survive? Yes. Did *less* people survive? Also yes.\n\nSame with driving while drinking. It wasn\u2019t a law until **1998** ffs. \n\nI\u2019ll bet that anybody who had their car stolen prior to air tags wishes there was a cheap and effective way of tracking their vehicle. \n\nI\u2019ll bet the parents who sent their kids to school or to play with a friend and never saw them again had a cheap and effective way to track their child. \n\nI\u2019ll bet people whose dogs manage to escape the yard really wish there was something you could clip onto their collar to help find them.", "Overprotective isn't usually cute, in fact it's pretty annoying. I don't think OP meant it in a positive way. Most people with overprotective parents know they mean no harm but end up doing it anyways.", "You can get a restraining order for stalking right?

Does he ask inappropriate questions? Etc", "In theory, yes. In reality, it is incredibly, incredibly difficult. \n\nI\u2019ve had clients who were being absolutely tormented, stalker caught on camera at their jobs, messing with their cars, etc. and the cops basically said \u201ccome back when he\u2019s actually hurt you.\u201d", "I honestly wonder if it's paired with any controlling behaviour.", "Omg, yes.

This was also for security in this way everyone knows where everybody is.", "I've been moved out for two years and still have my location shared with my mom, and she shares her with me.

Location is turned on again pretty quickly. I consider myself as being a decent teen but we didn\u2019t have the most involved parents and my friends and I did some sketchy stuff (sneaking out of the house, meeting people in fields etc).
