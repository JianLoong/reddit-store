Full stop. There doesn\u2019t even need to be abuse (which there is in your case). \n\nDepending on where you live, it\u2019s illegal to do what he did, so it may be worth talking to a lawyer to give your dad a cease and desist letter. \n\nYOU ARE AN ADULT!!!!!

He lied full outright and was surprised she found it. He was hoping she'd never find it. Meaning he was happy to lie to her as long as possible.\n\nThat is NOT healthy or right! She's over 30. It's up to her to decide how and who knows her location and she knows how to keep herself safe best. He's not with her 24/7 he's not likely to be by her side if shit goes sideways so he has to trust that she knows how to do what she needs to be safe.\n\nHe crossed major lines and boundaries and that ain't right. He needs to apologize and trust that he raised his kid right. And actually have a proper conversation and not just do this illegal shit!
