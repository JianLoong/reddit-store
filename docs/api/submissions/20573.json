But, unfortunately, that will limit your relationships. It will limit the closeness and intimacy you can build. \n\nSo: I really encourage you to find a really good therapist who focuses on attachment and developmental trauma. \n\nAnd I encourage you to cut your father off unless and until he can treat you like an adult. \n\nYou having these conversations and then coming back the next week only teaches him that he can be as invasive as he wants and the only consequence is an uncomfortable convo. That is well worth the price for him, as evidenced by the fact he keeps doing it. \n\nHe\u2019s not going to stop, you need to refuse him access. \n\nNTA", "NTA but stop visiting him every weekend.

It's never okay for someone to track and control a grown adult like this.\n\nAt a minimum, do not go visit your father for many weeks.\n\nIn the US you could file a police report for this behavior.  Some places would just file the paper, some would call him and tell him to knock it off, and some would arrest him unless you asked them not to.  Feel free to point out to him that what he did is stalking, and that you'll call the police if he does anything like that again.  I suggest texting him that since it will be easier for you to tell him what you need to that way.  Tell him not to try to contact you.  That you need a break from him and if/when you're ready to talk to him you'll initiate contact.\n\nThen set the ringtone on his contact to silent, put your phone face down in another room and go do something you enjoy.  It's better than actually blocking him, because you can collect his voice marks and text messages in case you need proof of what he's doing.\n\nAlternatively, you can just block him, which makes it easier not to think about him.", "NTA - No, you're not overreacting.  It's a massive breach of trust and privacy.  How often does your dad do things like this?\n\nIf I were in your position I would go low contact until he learns to respect small boundaries from a distance.  Honestly, this behaviour would scare the shit of me.", "Unsurprisingly there's a lot of \"go NC noooooowwww\" on the thread. If you wanted to do this, it would certainly be justified, but I think it's a lot more difficult and painful to do in practice than is assumed on this sub. I don't think it should be step #1 here.\n\nI suspect your dad can't cope with his own anxiety about something bad happening to you, and so he outsources that anxiety on to you by trying to control your behaviour. The fact that you have to ask whether objecting to a tag on your car makes you a bad person suggests you're struggling to define your boundaries with your father. His behaviour is unacceptable but when you have a parent like this they condition you to feel guilty about upsetting them even when their behaviour has upset you. Talking to him about this is a waste of time. I imagine you have this fantasy that if you could just find the right words he would get it and act like a normal parent. But he won't. The only thing you can do to change the situation is change your own behaviour.\n\nNTA but I think some therapy for yourself would help and I'd also recommend a book called \"adult children of emotionally immature parents\".

As a matter of fact, if he's been in your home, you need to check the house for hidden cameras and listening devices. No matter what kind of anxiety issues he has, he can seek professional help for them and not burden you with his dysfunction. That is beyond creepy and controlling.", "Nope nuh uh, girl. No. You need to grow a backbone.\n\nMy dad took a brunt of the child rearing with me. But I have NEVER been obligated to do any of these things. I visit him once a month at best and call once a week. I call him more when I want to talk to him. Usually to let him know what both of us are up to.\n\nThese are things he is totally fine with and he has never ONCE resorted to tracking me with an AirTag. You need to set boundaries:\n\n1) For the AirTag, don\u2019t visit your dad for a month. He should not be tracking a 32 year old woman.\n\n2) after that month, visits will be MONTHLY, if that, but under new rules:\n\n- he seeks out therapy as to why he feels these extremes are necessary.\n\n- if he ever plants an AirTag or other tracking device on you or your vehicle again you will be going to the police, as this stealth tracking is typical of stalkers.\n\nGrow yourself a backbone.

I have to really be convinced.", "NTA\n\nYou are *under*reacting. Your father is not overprotective; he is overbearing. You're 32, you've been an adult for 14 years. If this weren't done by your immediate family it'd be broadly considered stalking and would be a slam-dunk case for a restraining order.\n\nI would strongly recommend getting some therapy and going low-contact if not no-contact altogether. It's very clear that your father does not respect your autonomy, boundaries, or you as a whole -- he *refused to tell you where he planted it even after being called out.* He will continue to disrespect everything about you and overstep boundaries until he's shown that there are lasting consequences for his actions, that you are the only one who gets to decide when those consequences have run their course, and whether or not he is afforded your forgiveness and/or a second chance.\n\nThe reason I recommend therapy because you're obviously shaken up and conflicted about this. A trained professional is perfect for helping you navigate an event like this and it's what they're meant for. Other comments will suggest that you may have repressed trauma but that's something to think about after the current situation has been navigated -- and more importantly after you are in a place where you feel safe and comfortable to explore that, if at all.\n\nLastly on a personal note I have been in a situation with my father that's fairly similar to what you're going through. I went no-contact with him by sending him a text telling him what he did wrong, what he put me through, what I am feeling, why he made me feel that way, and the next steps. I outlined that he would not be the one to contact me -- I would contact him if and when I was ready. **He continued to contact me** because just like your situation this is an issue with a lack of respect. I'm still going through this and I'll have to evaluate how much longer that I'll refuse to allow him a foothold in my life, but the important thing is that I call the shots here. The same is true with you: you are the one to call the shots when it comes to your life. Your father has proven through his actions that he doesn't share that belief.\n\nBe strong, stand up for yourself, keep your boundaries firm, and no matter what demand the respect you are due.

Personally, I hope I would remove the air tag, then return it to dad with a cupcake.  \n\nThere is a time and place to place an air tag, for example my lovely 80 yo father who has dementia and access to car keys.

Okay, I missed an exit in downtown NYC and well, I was a bit lost. From my perspective, I had never been in downtown NYC and I found it fascinating. I eventually drove my way out with a sore neck from looking at all the sights.  Getting lost is sometimes a benefit IMO.  But I had to meet someone in Providence at a certain time, so I had to get a move on.\n\nThe next day I get a call while I am sitting with my daughter and SIL from my  husband of 23 years asking what I was doing in NYC. I replied that I missed an exit and well, it was kind of fun.\n\nHusband is a retired policeman. He does not consider being lost to be \"fun\" nor will he visit NYC.  Whatever.  Honestly, it creeped me out. He wanted to talk later that night and I simply said, \"No, there is nothing to discuss.  I am safe and it is over.\"\n\nWe now agree to disagree, but honestly, I hate that he would track where I went and ask me about it. Next time I will use my own toll tag, or simply pay cash.

It\u2019s good you\u2019ve had a conversation with him about it so he knows your boundaries and that he\u2019s crossed a line. \n\nIt\u2019s controlling behaviour and you as a grown woman are free to go and do whatever you want with whoever you want, you do not need to inform him about it at all. \n\nI think he has to learn to trust you; your decisions and your judgments. \n\nMaybe communicate with him how this has actually made you feel, in terms of wanting to just disappear.

She likes to run ahead in public places and is very frequently lost for long stretches of time. Recently, before I got the watch, we went to the zoo for the day and she was lost on and off for about half the time. We would eventually find her again and within ten minutes she had raced off and was lost again. She knows our phone numbers so often strangers will call us to say they found her and she asked them to call us. She knows the watch tracks her. She is okay with that. I'm hoping she won't need it in a few years.\n\nMy teenager (13) had location sharing turned on on his phone (again, with his knowledge and consent). He gets public transport home from school and gets a bit of anxiety that he might miss his stop. He likes that I can find him if he gets lost, without him having to text me or phone me and work out where he is.\n\nMy partner and I both have location sharing turned on, because we aren't going anywhere we don't want the other person knowing about, and because if, for example, I'm wondering if he will be home for dinner soon, or if he is still at work, I can check the app without having to phone and interrupt whatever he is doing.\n\nI cannot imagine thinking it would be okay to track any members of my family without them knowing or consenting to being tracked. The only exception I can think of would be if I had a child who is still a minor, and I was responsible for their safety and they were in danger of sneaking off and doing risky or harmful behaviour and would deliberately remove or disable a tracker they knew about.", "Ya my parents would not have pulled this at any age", "Omg yes. Stalking is what I immediately thought. Like this is just SO SO creepy. This isn't even over protective, this is just obsessive at this point. I would immediately cut contact with family if they started doing things this insane. \n\nNTA.

It\u2019s infuriating.", "Just curious, do you think it's okay to air tag your teenagers?", "In addition, every time he does something that breaks the boundary you have set, add another week onto the break you are taking from him.", "Yeah, I would have put it on a semi truck or mailed it to another country.", "What?!", "Is it that extreme though? Cause this dad is like literally stalking his 32 year old kid. It\u2019s creepy.", "I hope your daughter consented to this.", "Or give it to friends who go on holiday, business trips etc.", "Also have professionals check your electronic devices, OP.

Come on now dad...", "It\u2019s certainly ok to AirTag your teen\u2019s *car*. Very few teens are able to have a vehicle that their parents aren\u2019t in some way responsible for, whether it\u2019s by co-signing or paying for the insurance or outright owning it. I would absolutely want a way of tracking it in case something happened.", "I'll say I do. Not in every case,  but having once been responsible for a suicidal, extremely sheltered teen (took her in,  not my own raising), you bet her phone had location services on so we could find her.  You should not use it every minute,  but situationally, it's appropriate to monitor anyone for whom you are legally liable.", "I don\u2019t think so. Unless you\u2019re like a head of state or something and you have legitimate security concerns around your kids there\u2019s no reason to track them. Technology has enabled so much parental neuroses. The world is safer in many ways than it was when I was a kid (fentanyl proliferation notwithstanding), but you\u2019d never know it. \n\nI have a kid, so I\u2019m not talking out my butt here.", "When my sister was a teenager she was in active addiction. She would say she was going to work and end up at drug dealers houses instead (I know this from her telling me about that time much later in life). I would not have blamed my mom for tracking her location then if the tech was around at that time and I don\u2019t think my sister would have either, at least not now as a sober adult a couple decades later. She would probably have been much better off if they could have kept tabs on her instead of keeping her grounded indefinitely and not allowing her to work being the only solution to keep her from abusing going out privileges to meet with shady people. My parents probably would have done it to me too when I was working as a teen since my job was an internship that was a 40 minute drive from home and they always worried if I ended up working late- at least then they could have seen that my car was still in the parking lot at work or actively en route home (i.e. not stopped somewhere strange to indicate an accident) instead of calling while I was driving alone as a new and not yet confident enough driver to safely be talking on a phone, or calling when I couldn\u2019t answer while I was in an area on the property with no service or my phone was in a locker while I was on a horse (worked on a horse farm). My mom used to (and sometimes still does, even at 28, although now it\u2019s just if I don\u2019t cal her back, lol) get really panicky if I didn\u2019t answer even when the logical reason was right in front of her.

I agree with most of the points you all are making, NC is a hard suggestion for me to make so I\u2019ll debate the other side for another perspective when I can. In the end I hope OP makes whatever decision will bring her the most peace of mind, and maybe that\u2019s no contact. \n\nI\u2019m not against cutting people out, twice I have cut someone out of my life. It\u2019s just not something I take lightly and talking through it, I think, can help OP either way.", "Maybe 1-week of NC for this violation and increasing it by a week every time he oversteps when asked not to.
