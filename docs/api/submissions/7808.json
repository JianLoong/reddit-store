Mary\u2019s mom died of cervical/ovarian cancer when Mary was barely a year old - they didn\u2019t catch it until she was halfway into her pregnancy & by then she didn\u2019t want to risk losing her baby to chemo, so she put off treatment until after birth but by then they could only buy her time. \n\nObviously this was pretty traumatic for my husband & Mary has been in therapy since before I knew her to help with that loss as well. Mary is now almost 17 & we\u2019re really close. I never officially adopted her (though I offered) but I never needed a piece of paper to tell me I loved her as if she did come from me. We see musicals, take art classes, go shopping/out for coffee/to get our nails done, go hiking, etc. together because we genuinely enjoy hanging out. She\u2019s the best & only kid I\u2019ll ever have.\n\nTwo-ish weeks ago, Mary & I were at the nail salon when she nervously asked me to help her make an appointment with an OBGYN. Mary is almost never nervous (she told me immediately after she had her first kiss) so it piqued my interest but I said of course I would & asked if she had any specific issues or concerns. (She has been dating a boy for about 7.5 months so I thought maybe she wanted birth control.) But she explained how she\u2019d found & looked through some of her mom\u2019s hospital/medical records & it scared her enough that she wanted to get screened as soon as possible for cervical/ovarian/uterine cancer. She also asked that I not tell her dad right away because she didn\u2019t want to drag up any negative feelings, she wanted to tell him herself after she\u2019d been seen. I took this as Mary wanting to be more independent & autonomous so I acquiesced, made the appointment, & left it at that. \n\nThis past week was her appointment & at her request, I accompanied her to the office but waited in the car. Afterwards, she had a business card for a genetic counselor that the doctor recommended & was talking about possibly wanting to get a genetic screening to find out her cancer risk. When we got home, she went to find my husband in his study & they were in there for awhile talking. When they came out, Mary gave him a big hug & then my husband asked me if we could speak in private. \n\nOnce we were alone, he was SO pissed off at me for not telling him about the appointment & keeping it a secret. I tried to explain that Mary had asked me to & wanted to tell him herself so I was just respecting her wishes, but that wasn\u2019t a good enough excuse. To him she is still his child & any/all doctors appointments need to be run by him beforehand & not after it\u2019s been had. I apologized but he just said that now he doesn\u2019t know \u201cwhat other secrets you girls are hiding\u201d from him & has been sleeping on the couch in his office the past couple nights. \n\nAITA for not telling him right away?", "created_utc": 1674197720, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10gq3ux/aita_for_keeping_a_doctors_appointment_secret/", "score": 936, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I can totally relate to Mary, Dad will hopefully come around and be thankful you have been a woman she can trust in her life.", "NTA. But only because she was just going in to be proactive and get some testing done. If there was a serious issue with his daughters health & you didn\u2019t tell him, then I would understand his reaction.", "NTA. First of all, she's just being proactive. Second of all, she's 17!! Is he gonna demand to know about her OBGYN appointments and hopefully birth control when she's a legal adult in less than a year?", "NTA. She wanted to be screened and she wanted it done in privacy. You made the right call in respecting her wishes.", "NTA. Your daughter was scared and needed your support. And you did exactly that. Her health and well being is more important and she told your husband immediately.", "NTA. She was a grown-up about this. She showed responsibility and wisdom beyond a 17-year-old. She wanted to understand her own risk factors and wanted to spare her dad pain until she got good advice. You absolutely did the right thing, allowing her to see an obgyn when she requested it. At the same time, I can understand why he's pissed. She gave him the fear, and he's taking it out on you because he can't take it out on her. Just give him time to come to the realisation that it's better that she felt she could trust you rather than find out too late that there are issues that can't be dealt with.", "NTA. \ud83d\udcaf", "NTA. First time at the gyno can be awkward for girls. Maybe she also felt more comfortable with you as a woman. If it was anything else then yes, YWBTA for not telling her dad about a doctor. She's almost 17, not 7, and she didn't have any symptoms but was just scared and wanted to be proactive about it.", "NTA. She didn\u2019t have to tell either of you about any of it given her age but she clearly thinks a lot of OP to open up about her concerns.", "NAH.

Hoping he comes around and can see it from her perspective soon.", "NTA, certain problems are easier to talk about with a parent of the same gender, even if it is a step-parent. Does he really think if he had a stepson he'd want to go to his mum about a sex-related medical problem? And you've been a mother for her for 12 years.\n\nAlso he needs to get over it, because the next time Mary has something like this, she might not tell either of you - she won't tell her dad because she's naturally uncomfortable, and she won't tell you because she doesn't want to piss him off. And the consequences of that could be way worse. \n\nAnd come on, of course a stepmother and her stepdaughter have some secrets the dad doesn't know about!", "NTA it's HER body! His reaction is disturbing.", "NTA. She asked you to keep a medical procedure private, you are obligated to do that. If she had wanted to tell her dad, that is HERS TO TELL HIM.", "NTA. Mary made it clear that she intended to tell her father, but wanted to do it on her terms. She is trying to take control of a scary situation and she is so lucky to have your love and support. I think your husband is probably coming from a place of grief. Guilt that Mary has to worry about such things. Sadness that she is old enough to have to take it more seriously. Terror at the thought of watching his daughter go through what he watched her mother endure. It\u2019s often easier to feel anger than it is to feel pain. You sound like an incredibly intuitive and empathetic person, and I am sure that you will be successful in supporting your family through this next \u201cnew normal\u201d.", "NAH. I am so sorry you are in this scenario. This must be really hard for you and everyone involved.\n\n He is probably just worried about his daughter, especially after what happened with her Mom. You already apologized. Grief is probably just hitting him in the stomach with this, and he probably just needs a bit of time and space. I hope you both make up soon. \n\nOn another note that girl is near 18 and idk where you are from but where I am from soon her health info would be protected even against her parent. The hospital/doctor would need the patient's permission to tell him anything. He may need to cope with that soon. She's nearly an adult.\n\nIt says a lot about your relationship with her though that she came to you. \u2764\ufe0f I hope everything works out soon.", "NTA\n\nThere is a lot of traume involved here, and I get that Mary might have been overwhelmed with her own feelings, and not also needing the fathers on top of it all. I totally get talking to him after it all happened.\n\nBut the father is properly scared, cause of trauma from all of it. So I get his response.", "NTA. Id usually think his reaction is over the top. 17 is definitly old enough & it's imporant that she can confide in you her 2nd mom. But his wife passed away from the exact thing his daughter was just screened for. He has a lot of old feelings being stirred up on top of getting use to his daughter growing up. If he hasn't yet, he may need some counseling to get threw this rough patch. He probably thought he was doing great then got \"blindsided\" with scary-to-him news and grief resurfacing.", "NTA He is majorlly overeacting to this. You did the right thing by respecting her wishes. It shows how good your relationship is with her that she felt comfortable to not only talk to you about it but that you would make her the appointment without hestiation and not tell her father.\n\nTechnically, she's nearly an adult and could have chosen not to tell him at all.\n\nIt's great that she spoke to her doctor about her worries as some people bury their heads in the sand when it comes to their medical concerns.\n\nHe might be more upset that his little girl is growing up but is focusing his sadness on the wrong thing (the secret).\n\nHe'll be fine in a couple of days... You're doing a great job! Keep up the good work, OP!", "NTA. Mary has the right to privacy and you were correct to respect her wishes. She's going to be an adult soon and able to make all her own medical decisions for herself. Your husband is going to have to suck it up if she doesn't want to tell him things.", "I'm going with NAH.\n\nI get why you didn't say anything. Mary is 17 and is old enough to make decisions about her life. \n\nBut I get your husband's reaction. He saw his wife through cancer and it must be scary to think that his daughter might be next. It probably brought back a lot of memories when just that conversation with his kid.\n\nThat being said, I'd tell him he can take the time he wants to be pissed about this but that I won't be dealing with this behaviour for very long. His almost legally adult daughter asked me to take her to see a doctor and in the end, she acted maturely and came to talk to him about it. In a few months, she won't need to talk to him about anything if she doesn't want to. Might get used to it now.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Normally, they'd need a biopsy of the mothers tumour to be able to determine if the daughter is at risk for the same exact type of cancer. It's a complicated process (as they can't run a test of every single type of cancer or disease because of cost). That being said, a person can be high risk and never get the disease.

That\u2019s a super screwed up order of priorities.\n\nGenetic testing can help someone (and their doctors) make an informed decision about how often and how early to start various screening tests, among other things. For certain high risk cases, there are preventative treatments that people may want to pursue, and the earlier they are aware of the risk the more time they have to prepare and make decisions about treatment. For example, if someone finds out they have a BRCA mutation, there are medications they might be able to take to lower risk of developing breast cancer. Or they might choose to have a preventative mastectomy and/or hysterectomy. People at risk for ovarian or uterine cancer might choose to have frequent and early ultrasound screenings, or might want to retrieve and freeze some eggs in case they lose an ovary down the line or decide to have kids through a surrogate.\n\nHer ability to consider and make decisions about her own treatment should be the priority, without regard for how ignorance might comfort her father.", "In the US obgyn and family planning services are permitted without parental consent are age 13", "Nope.\nPaying for their insurance and medical care is our obligation as parents, it doesn't entitle us to their medical information after a certain age.\n\nIt's a thing we all need to wrap our heads around as parents... \n\nThey let us in the room for a while after that starts being true (there's an overlap grey area) but even then they kick us out to have a private conversation about ANYTHING the kiddo might prefer to tackle out of ear shot.

Been through that with my mum and had the testing done, luckily I dont have the gene but as so many have died from ovarian and breast cancer in my family (those had the gene) I am still at a higher risk of getting it", "You can't understand why a daughter, who lost her mother to cancer, would want to keep a secret of getting tested for cancer?

And if Mary had wanted an adult there with her during the appointment instead of in the car, then I assume she would have asked OP to come.\n\nBut you weren't talking about the law, you were talking about \"respect\" and \"ethics\" and my response stays the same: when a child is 17 years old, the balance tips heavily in their favor when it comes to what info their parents are entitled to know.\n\nIt would have been disrespectful *to the daughter* to go behind her back and tell her father.", " I think it\u2019s crazy, yes.
