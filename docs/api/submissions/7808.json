Mary\u2019s mom died of cervical/ovarian cancer when Mary was barely a year old - they didn\u2019t catch it until she was halfway into her pregnancy & by then she didn\u2019t want to risk losing her baby to chemo, so she put off treatment until after birth but by then they could only buy her time. \n\nObviously this was pretty traumatic for my husband & Mary has been in therapy since before I knew her to help with that loss as well. Mary is now almost 17 & we\u2019re really close. I never officially adopted her (though I offered) but I never needed a piece of paper to tell me I loved her as if she did come from me. We see musicals, take art classes, go shopping/out for coffee/to get our nails done, go hiking, etc. together because we genuinely enjoy hanging out. She\u2019s the best & only kid I\u2019ll ever have.\n\nTwo-ish weeks ago, Mary & I were at the nail salon when she nervously asked me to help her make an appointment with an OBGYN. Mary is almost never nervous (she told me immediately after she had her first kiss) so it piqued my interest but I said of course I would & asked if she had any specific issues or concerns. (She has been dating a boy for about 7.5 months so I thought maybe she wanted birth control.) But she explained how she\u2019d found & looked through some of her mom\u2019s hospital/medical records & it scared her enough that she wanted to get screened as soon as possible for cervical/ovarian/uterine cancer. She also asked that I not tell her dad right away because she didn\u2019t want to drag up any negative feelings, she wanted to tell him herself after she\u2019d been seen. I took this as Mary wanting to be more independent & autonomous so I acquiesced, made the appointment, & left it at that. \n\nThis past week was her appointment & at her request, I accompanied her to the office but waited in the car. Afterwards, she had a business card for a genetic counselor that the doctor recommended & was talking about possibly wanting to get a genetic screening to find out her cancer risk. When we got home, she went to find my husband in his study & they were in there for awhile talking. When they came out, Mary gave him a big hug & then my husband asked me if we could speak in private. \n\nOnce we were alone, he was SO pissed off at me for not telling him about the appointment & keeping it a secret. I tried to explain that Mary had asked me to & wanted to tell him herself so I was just respecting her wishes, but that wasn\u2019t a good enough excuse. To him she is still his child & any/all doctors appointments need to be run by him beforehand & not after it\u2019s been had. I apologized but he just said that now he doesn\u2019t know \u201cwhat other secrets you girls are hiding\u201d from him & has been sleeping on the couch in his office the past couple nights. \n\nAITA for not telling him right away?", "created_utc": 1674197720, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10gq3ux/aita_for_keeping_a_doctors_appointment_secret/", "score": 29, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I can totally relate to Mary, Dad will hopefully come around and be thankful you have been a woman she can trust in her life.", "NTA. But only because she was just going in to be proactive and get some testing done. If there was a serious issue with his daughters health & you didn\u2019t tell him, then I would understand his reaction.", "NTA. First of all, she's just being proactive. Second of all, she's 17!! Is he gonna demand to know about her OBGYN appointments and hopefully birth control when she's a legal adult in less than a year?", "NTA. She wanted to be screened and she wanted it done in privacy. You made the right call in respecting her wishes.", "NTA. Your daughter was scared and needed your support. And you did exactly that. Her health and well being is more important and she told your husband immediately.", "NTA. She was a grown-up about this. She showed responsibility and wisdom beyond a 17-year-old. She wanted to understand her own risk factors and wanted to spare her dad pain until she got good advice. You absolutely did the right thing, allowing her to see an obgyn when she requested it. At the same time, I can understand why he's pissed. She gave him the fear, and he's taking it out on you because he can't take it out on her. Just give him time to come to the realisation that it's better that she felt she could trust you rather than find out too late that there are issues that can't be dealt with.", "NTA. \ud83d\udcaf", "NTA. First time at the gyno can be awkward for girls. Maybe she also felt more comfortable with you as a woman. If it was anything else then yes, YWBTA for not telling her dad about a doctor. She's almost 17, not 7, and she didn't have any symptoms but was just scared and wanted to be proactive about it.", "NTA. She didn\u2019t have to tell either of you about any of it given her age but she clearly thinks a lot of OP to open up about her concerns.", "NAH. I understand him feeling upset and left out, but I also understand Mary's reasoning. I wouldn't have shared either, in your situation. Hoping he comes around and can see it from her perspective soon.", "NTA, certain problems are easier to talk about with a parent of the same gender, even if it is a step-parent. Does he really think if he had a stepson he'd want to go to his mum about a sex-related medical problem? And you've been a mother for her for 12 years.\n\nAlso he needs to get over it, because the next time Mary has something like this, she might not tell either of you - she won't tell her dad because she's naturally uncomfortable, and she won't tell you because she doesn't want to piss him off. And the consequences of that could be way worse. \n\nAnd come on, of course a stepmother and her stepdaughter have some secrets the dad doesn't know about!", "NTA it's HER body! His reaction is disturbing.", "NTA. She asked you to keep a medical procedure private, you are obligated to do that. If she had wanted to tell her dad, that is HERS TO TELL HIM.", "NTA. Mary made it clear that she intended to tell her father, but wanted to do it on her terms. She is trying to take control of a scary situation and she is so lucky to have your love and support. I think your husband is probably coming from a place of grief. Guilt that Mary has to worry about such things. Sadness that she is old enough to have to take it more seriously. Terror at the thought of watching his daughter go through what he watched her mother endure. It\u2019s often easier to feel anger than it is to feel pain. You sound like an incredibly intuitive and empathetic person, and I am sure that you will be successful in supporting your family through this next \u201cnew normal\u201d.", "NAH. I am so sorry you are in this scenario. This must be really hard for you and everyone involved.\n\n He is probably just worried about his daughter, especially after what happened with her Mom. You already apologized. Grief is probably just hitting him in the stomach with this, and he probably just needs a bit of time and space. I hope you both make up soon. \n\nOn another note that girl is near 18 and idk where you are from but where I am from soon her health info would be protected even against her parent. The hospital/doctor would need the patient's permission to tell him anything. He may need to cope with that soon. She's nearly an adult.\n\nIt says a lot about your relationship with her though that she came to you. \u2764\ufe0f I hope everything works out soon.", "NTA\n\nThere is a lot of traume involved here, and I get that Mary might have been overwhelmed with her own feelings, and not also needing the fathers on top of it all. I totally get talking to him after it all happened.\n\nBut the father is properly scared, cause of trauma from all of it. So I get his response.", "NTA. Id usually think his reaction is over the top. 17 is definitly old enough & it's imporant that she can confide in you her 2nd mom. But his wife passed away from the exact thing his daughter was just screened for. He has a lot of old feelings being stirred up on top of getting use to his daughter growing up. If he hasn't yet, he may need some counseling to get threw this rough patch. He probably thought he was doing great then got \"blindsided\" with scary-to-him news and grief resurfacing.", "NTA He is majorlly overeacting to this. You did the right thing by respecting her wishes. It shows how good your relationship is with her that she felt comfortable to not only talk to you about it but that you would make her the appointment without hestiation and not tell her father.\n\nTechnically, she's nearly an adult and could have chosen not to tell him at all.\n\nIt's great that she spoke to her doctor about her worries as some people bury their heads in the sand when it comes to their medical concerns.\n\nHe might be more upset that his little girl is growing up but is focusing his sadness on the wrong thing (the secret).\n\nHe'll be fine in a couple of days... You're doing a great job! Keep up the good work, OP!", "NTA. Mary has the right to privacy and you were correct to respect her wishes. She's going to be an adult soon and able to make all her own medical decisions for herself. Your husband is going to have to suck it up if she doesn't want to tell him things.", "I'm going with NAH.\n\nI get why you didn't say anything. Mary is 17 and is old enough to make decisions about her life. \n\nBut I get your husband's reaction. He saw his wife through cancer and it must be scary to think that his daughter might be next. It probably brought back a lot of memories when just that conversation with his kid.\n\nThat being said, I'd tell him he can take the time he wants to be pissed about this but that I won't be dealing with this behaviour for very long. His almost legally adult daughter asked me to take her to see a doctor and in the end, she acted maturely and came to talk to him about it. In a few months, she won't need to talk to him about anything if she doesn't want to. Might get used to it now.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He's not entitled to know everything about his teenage daughter's life.  If you'd told him, she never would've felt safe to tell you anything in confidence again.

Even if it is just a screening.", "YTA.  You heart was in the right place, but the decision you made was inappropriate.  IMO the answer should have been to establish  your position as neutral.  Daughter should have consulted with dad before making the appointment.  Do something to reestablish a connection with dad and reaffirm the connection with daughter.  Perhaps a family meeting would work, but counselling might be a better option.", "ESH", "Of course if she had said \u201cI noticed I have a weird lump on my breast that I want to have looked at\u201d or anything to make me think something was immediately/acutely wrong, then I definitely would\u2019ve told her that we had to loop in her dad, even offered to tell him for her if she was embarrassed to do it herself. But since it was basically a checkup (with the added layer of a family history of cancer), I thought she was old enough to decide when to tell him about her own appointment.", "Agreed. She is almost an adult and should have enough autonomy to make an appointment that is common to keep between women. Kinda rude of your husband to be that \u201cshe\u2019s my kid not yours\u201d when you have put so much time into spending with her. And the reason for the secret was obviously specific and thoughtful enough that he should not be worried and should take a huge chill pill.", "I\u2019m hoping we can talk some more this weekend and hopefully he\u2019ll come around to see at least my perspective. Losing Mary\u2019s mom was incredibly hard on him (we met in a grief group, me for the loss of my twin and him for Mary\u2019s mom), so from where I was sitting it mostly seemed like Mary didn\u2019t want to upset him with the possibility of him losing her to the same thing that took her mom.

We actually don\u2019t yet know who was out of line. At 17 she likely has the right, not her dad. \n\nIf he treats her like a toddler, is he even going to be willing to make an OB GYN appointment?", "I understand and I do generally agree. I guess for me, I started seeing a GYN when I was 16/17 just for regular checkups and she\u2019s technically at the age that she could make her own appointments without telling either one of us if she wanted to. Before this, of course he was always in the loop about any and all appointments but I guess I assumed she was close enough to adulthood that her request to tell him herself when she was ready didn\u2019t seem unreasonable. Thank you for your response either way - I appreciate it and accept your judgment.", "Nope, sexual health privacy is a right.", "You should explain", "Yes. I agree 100%", "He can be upset. But his reaction was way over the top. He should have thanked OP for helping his daughter get tested.", "I could understand him being internally upset as a knee jerk reaction, but then his brain should have overriden his heart and told him no one actually did anything wrong, so his emotions are his to process without unfairly lashing out.\n\nI do not understand him genuinely getting mad at his wife and treating her like this.\n\nLike how its understandable be jealous on the inside that someone else got the promotion you wanted at work, but not understandable actually act angry with them or the person who gave them the promotion.", "He can feel however he wants. His fear doesn't give him the right to steal his daughter's bodily autonomy or to punish his wife for empowering his daughter. The only reason his daughter chose to wait until after this emotionally loaded but otherwise routine doctors visit to tell him was because she KNOWS he's not capable of being rational or supportive in this area and that it would set him off.\n\nA 17 year old doesnt need to be responsible for all of his fears on top of all of her own anxieties going into that appointment. He should be channeling  these feelings into therapy instead of letting them bleed out so much his teenager knows she can't even tell him about a doctors visit.", "There\u2019s definitely some nuance to it, and I don\u2019t actually think you\u2019re an AH for respecting her wishes. However, I do personally believe if one parent knows medical information about their child, then they should inform the other. I think it\u2019s especially pertinent here due to her bio mom\u2019s history.", "His reaction is over the top but understandable, hell, I'd be upset if my daughter and wife didnt want to me she was having a test/scan and I havent lost a wife like he has (I'd not react like he has, just be upset).\n\nWould you say his reaction was \"disturbing\"?", "The guy lost his wife to the exact same thing his daughter - who he probably loves more than anything in the world  - had a scan for.\n\nHis reaction is not logical or fair on the wife but his reaction is surely at least understandable? My specific gripe is that this behaviour is \"disturbing\". Do we not have any empathy, compassion or understanding here?\n\nDo you find his reaction disturbing?", "And I completely agree. Had she said \u201cI want to see a GYN because I have this weird lump on my breast\u201d then I definitely would have said \u201clet\u2019s make the appointment but we have to tell dad\u201d, but since she didn\u2019t have any acute symptoms and just wanted to be proactive I figured it would be okay to let her tell him.\n\nI still appreciate your input and understanding. Thank you!", "shes 17 and was being responsible, he being sad its understandable, him being fucking pissed putting all the blame on the wife, expressing that \"dont know what the girls are hiding\" and setting camp in the couch its disturbing.", "Yes we have empathy, that's why his feelings were understandable, but his actions are not.\n\nI find his actions unfair, immature, and selfish.\n\nI find it concerning that you think lashing out at people who did nothing wrong is understandable if your feelings are hurt at the time.", "I would agree on that assessment of his actions to a certain degree.\n\nConfirming you dont find his actions disturbing?\n\nYour last line is also grossly simplifying the scenario", "The original comment is unclear over which part of the reaction they find disturbing.\n\nThe lashing out is as disturbing as any unfair, selfish, immature actions are disturbing.\n\n\"what other secrets you girls are hiding\" could be very disturbing depending on what secrets he is imagining. E.g. if he thinks its more gyno stuff.\n\nThe fact he is demanding to be told about the gyno appointments of a 17 year old even if she is uncomfortable with it is disturbing to me. I would have thought he would respect her autonomy enough to be happy with just being told any relevant results from appointments. Sure legally he may be able to demand that right up till she is 18, but legal doesn't mean its not disturbing."]}
