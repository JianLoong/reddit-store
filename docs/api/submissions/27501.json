This guy was crushing on you so he thought the best way to get close to you was to get in with your bullies. He was a chickensh!t that got his jollies off teasing you instead of being a hero and protecting you. He's still trying to manipulate the situation and you.... Looooove the way he calls you an 'unconventional beauty' that other people wouldn't get. Is that actually a complement? And 'protected you'? Really. Nope. \n\n8 years is a long time to burn a flame for a girl you were cruel to and expect her to be swept of her feet when she finds out your an even bigger weirdo for why your supposedly acted the way you did.\n\nNormal humans would be embarrassed and slink off.
