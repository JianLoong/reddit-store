I (26F) and getting married to my fianc\u00e9 (24F) this summer. We are having two weddings, one on a Friday and one the following Saturday. \n\nFriday is going to be an intimate ceremony with just my fianc\u00e9s immediate family. Only 12 people will be there. It\u2019s going to be a lot fancier and elegant, but we can afford it because it\u2019s really small. They also have supported us through our whole relationship and I love them very much. \n\nSaturday is going to be a huge wedding/reception with 300 guests. We are going to \u201cget married\u201d again and then have a blowout party. It will not be as fancy since throwing a 300 person wedding gets expensive fast. \n\nThe problem: I recently told my sister (25) that she nor any of my family is invited to the Friday wedding. There are tons of reasons but honestly the main reason is that my family is really religious and has always disagreed with my \u201cchoice\u201d (that\u2019s what they believe) to be a lesbian. I even asked my sister last year if she would be a bridesmaid and she said no, because she couldn\u2019t stand up in front of a crowd and publicly support a gay marriage. \n\nWhen I told her she was really upset and said she felt excluded and sad. I said there\u2019s still the big Saturday wedding, but she said it wouldn\u2019t be the same. I reminded her about what she said last year about being a bridesmaid and she said she didn\u2019t ever remember saying that. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to think. I know it\u2019s tradition to have your family at your wedding and she seems genuinely sad.  Also for the record, I told my other sister about this arrangement and she was completely fine with it.

Her family excluded themselves from the more intimate wedding by being homophobic.

If she wants the benefits of a good relationship with you, she needs to fix the relationship first. NTA", "No no and noooooope. People don't just \"forget\" being a bigot. Frankly she should consider herself lucky to even be invited to the big party. I wouldn't be inviting anyone who was a homophobe, unless they had taken steps towards less hate.
