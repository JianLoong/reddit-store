I (26F) and getting married to my fianc\u00e9 (24F) this summer. We are having two weddings, one on a Friday and one the following Saturday. \n\nFriday is going to be an intimate ceremony with just my fianc\u00e9s immediate family. Only 12 people will be there. It\u2019s going to be a lot fancier and elegant, but we can afford it because it\u2019s really small. They also have supported us through our whole relationship and I love them very much. \n\nSaturday is going to be a huge wedding/reception with 300 guests. We are going to \u201cget married\u201d again and then have a blowout party. It will not be as fancy since throwing a 300 person wedding gets expensive fast. \n\nThe problem: I recently told my sister (25) that she nor any of my family is invited to the Friday wedding. There are tons of reasons but honestly the main reason is that my family is really religious and has always disagreed with my \u201cchoice\u201d (that\u2019s what they believe) to be a lesbian. I even asked my sister last year if she would be a bridesmaid and she said no, because she couldn\u2019t stand up in front of a crowd and publicly support a gay marriage. \n\nWhen I told her she was really upset and said she felt excluded and sad. I said there\u2019s still the big Saturday wedding, but she said it wouldn\u2019t be the same. I reminded her about what she said last year about being a bridesmaid and she said she didn\u2019t ever remember saying that. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to think. I know it\u2019s tradition to have your family at your wedding and she seems genuinely sad.  Also for the record, I told my other sister about this arrangement and she was completely fine with it.

Her family excluded themselves from the more intimate wedding by being homophobic. Loads of people have two weddings - when they are getting married abroad (where usually only intimate family members are invited), have two families with different religions, etc. I do think OP should have told her sister but I don't think that makes her the AH.", "I don\u2019t know your other sis but it could be relieved or just also accepting/respecting what you want for your wedding.\n\nETA:Does he rest of your immediate family know?

Partners family you supports yours does not.  A little different but before I cut my MIL out completely we hosted main events with family and friends and did small side events with MIL because she was toxic.

They got an incredibly generous invitation to a massive party celebrating a choice they have directly told you they disapprove of, what more do you owe them?\n\nThe gall of your sister. If she wants the benefits of a good relationship with you, she needs to fix the relationship first. NTA", "No no and noooooope. People don't just \"forget\" being a bigot. Frankly she should consider herself lucky to even be invited to the big party. I wouldn't be inviting anyone who was a homophobe, unless they had taken steps towards less hate.

If they don't support your wedding, they shouldn't be at either.\n\nNTA, except to yourself.", "NTA. But why is she even invited to the second wedding?", "NTA but I would consider this as a sort of change in views on her part that might even spark a change in the rest of your family.  So when thinking about the kind of future you want, do you think that having them in your life would be nice? If so, then it makes sense to just invite her", "After that comment, I probably wouldn't have invited her to either wedding. NTA", "NTA you had me at her not standing up for you. If she can\u2019t stand up for you then I do not see why being at your first wedding is so important. I mean she doesn\u2019t agree with gay weddings right? She has no right to be mad. She may not remember her comment but you tell her you remember because it\u2019s easy to remember comments that deeply hurt you.", "So basically she wants to go to your 'fancy' wedding (probably to show off ig) and perhaps ruin it as she's not supporter of your gay marriage..

Comments are making me feel a lot better about my choice!", "I was suspicious of that too..", "I said this is another comment but I\u2019m going to go with an engrained sense of duty to family I was raised with. They want to come to Saturday so I just happily accepted that. My brothers church is stripping him of Sunday school teaching for attending Saturday, so they also see it as a sacrifice of their morals I think. I know, yikes. I totally get the comments saying they shouldn\u2019t be invited to either.", "NTA.  Unless she was black-out drunk at the time, she remembered exactly what she said. She doesn't get to sit on the fence and pick and choose when to support you.  Congrats!", "It's unlikely she actually forgot saying it.  It's much more likely that she's hoping that YOU forgot. She's lucky to be invited to the second wedding! No way does she deserve to go to the first.\n\nHave a fantastic time at both weddings! My condolences for having to deal with a \"Very religious\" family.  I had one too... which more often than not seems to mean intolerance, constant judgement and not much compassion or generosity.

I hope your wedding is lovely - congratulations on getting married. \n\n\u2764\ufe0f\n\n(NTA)", "Misogynist-cist?", "Good for you! Congratulations on your wedding!", "Ok but that\u2019s a different debate", "But that\u2019s not the question. Why cater to two different viewpoints? Just stick to your own beliefs and if you\u2019re not supported, then you don\u2019t invite those people. The OP is essentially saying that 12 people made the cut and 288 didn\u2019t but the 2nd string can have their own wedding. She could have just had an engagement party but actually had a wedding ceremony instead for the chosen group.", "It isn\u2019t a secret so everyone on Saturday will know.. they live in the state adjacent to mine so even though they aren\u2019t involved in wedding planning, I figured they would find out one way or another, better from me.", "ovarian-cist?", "I\u2019ve only told my two sisters. I have a brother and parents to tell still. Chose my sisters first because they are the most reasonable.. however hypocritical my sister is about not supporting us but wanting an invite, my parents will be 10x worse", "It's the entire reason the situation exists at all, so no - it's not.", "Could you spin it as you are doing a wedding per family?I\u2019m sorry that you are having to deal with all of this. If your parents are 10x worse then just be prepared for the fallout. It sounds like your family broaden their views to attend your wedding, but your in laws were there the entire time.  You guys wanted to do something special for your partner\u2019s family because of that support and love.  Nothing wrong with that.", "NTA\n\nFuck a tradition.  If she couldn't support you, she didn't earn the place of privilege in the _real_ wedding.", "NTA.  Your immediate family does not support marriage equality.  They do not support you as a lesbian, which they see as a choice, such a picking out a pair of shoes.  Why on earth would they be present at the tiny wedding of the people who have supported you and your wife throughout your relationship, especially since they are (through the forgiving goodness of your heart) welcome at the larger, blow-out wedding that comes later?", "NTA!", "NTA. Yes, it may be \u201ctradition\u201d to have family at your wedding, but tradition doesn\u2019t really matter when your family has been unsupportive of your sexuality and relationship. She seems more upset about not going to the party than all of the hurt she\u2019s caused you. I think that alone is very telling. I hope your weddings are great!", "Actions don\u2019t exist in a vacuum", "NTA! You deserve to get married to your wife with our having homophobic people around! Enjoy your intimate ceremony and then your big bash! Congratulations to you and your wife\ud83d\udc9e", "NTA\n\n\nThe first one is for those who have supported your relationship. Unfortunately, your sister doesn't fall under that category...", "NTA\n\nYou sister felt excluded and sad? Well she was excluded from 1 even for 1 day because of something she could change (her fd up views). \n\nHow many times have you been excluded and hurt because of something that is literally impossible to change (sexual preference)?", "Right? I'm surprise OP invited the homophobes to either wedding...", "When my wife and I got married (also lesbians), we made the decision not to invite family members who made it clear they were homophobic and against gay marriage.  Best decision we ever made.  Honestly, you don't want people who think you shouldn't even have the right to get married there on the day you're celebrating your love. Stay strong!", "She is forgetting it coz she wants a taste of that $$$ ceremony. Because gays are bad but expensive champagne is not. \n\nBigots always get defensive and deny being bigots when they are called out.\n\nHave a lovely wedding free of homophobes.
