I am so mentally and physically exhausted from everything I\u2019m not sure how much I can take.

I asked her why she couldn\u2019t take the after school bus and my mom told me that she won\u2019t get home until 8. I told her that it wasn\u2019t my problem nor my responsibility and she got mad at me. She told me I was making everything harder for her but I again told her my sister isn\u2019t my daughter. She started to call me names and I just went to my room because their was no point in fighting with her. An hour later she came into my room YELLING AT ME for forgetting to put a trash bag in the bin. \n\nAt this point she managed to wake up my dad with all her yelling and he came in too all pissed. I started to argue back saying that I wasn\u2019t their f-ing maid. I was their daughter who lived there too. I told them that if they had so many problems with how I did things than they should just do it themselves. And their is no reason why I need to be doing all the chores in this house. I told them that it wasn\u2019t fair to me because I have a life too. I\u2019m a human too who gets tired of doing everything by myself with no help. My parents were not happy and stated that this was teaching me \u201cresponsibilities\u201d but I called bs. I again stated that I am not a maid and if they keep treating me like one they have to pay me. \n\nTo say the least my parents aren\u2019t happy my mom went around the family telling them everything that happened so if I leave no one can help me. I woke up to my phone being bombed with texts from my family saying I was a bad daughter and that I should\u2019ve never talked to my parents like that. That they are only trying to teach me how hard life can be. And as the oldest daughter it is my duty to do all these rings plus more. I\u2019m very much confused as to what lies my mom has now spread about me. Because all I said was I wasn\u2019t going to be their live in maid anymore. I can\u2019t take this toxicity anymore but just with my engineering job I will not make enough to support myself in this economy.

Their only excuse seems to be that you \"should\" be doing a lot of chores, which is pretty rich coming from people shirking their own responsibilities.", "NTA, but it sounds like you either have to deal with it or find alternate living arrangements.

You have some decisions to make, OP!", "Changed to NTA after OP's comments. if OP funds their education themselves, parents are certianly more out of line than I thought.\n\nFirst, yelling is certainly not the best way to communicate, from them or from you.\n\nBut looking at your post and comments, you seem to think you do EVERYTHING. While you do more than your fair share, you don't cook or do laundry. You also don't pay rent (I mean market rent) AND your parents pay for your education EVEN THOUGH you have a full time job.\n\nYou are entitled to feel tired and like you have no time for yourself, that's fair. And if you are doing much more than your siblings, then your parants are TA for that.\n\nBut if you move out, you will still have to pay for water, electricity, WIFI, groceries. And rent. And school fees. You'll need a car and you'll pay for its upkeep. You'll need to cook, do laundry, take care of your taxes, medical bills. And if you have roommates you'll maybe deal with people who don't clean as much as you want them to.\n\nMaybe talk to your parennts when nobody is angry, say that with work, school and the home responsibilities you are close to burnout and you would hate failing your studies, so you and them need to discuss chores in a calm manner. The other otpion is to move out, but from what you said, that will mean dropping out of school, or living with rooomates and no money till you graduate.

What's left to your parents? Tidying, cooking and grocery shopping? For 2 adults? You're right to put your foot down. Put enough money aside and move out.", "Just stop doing all the chores, it  doea not seem like tney want you to leave home\n\nIt a game of who is more stuborned", "NTA. Solely  for you me mental health and place that should contain happiness if causing you pain and problems, After 18 did you parents sit you down and ask for rent or to subitute it with chores and baby sitting?", "Maybe it\u2019s just me or my family but I can phantom my extended family texting/calling me over disagreements.  WTF?", "YTA, if those chores you listed are the ones you do, that's pretty reasonable for a 19 year old living rent free \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0fthere's a lot more than that going on in running a house, you're not doing everything by a long shot. You can move out and pay rent and do all that plus everything else if you want.", "You have a couple of options.\n\nOne, demand a lease agreement from your parents and pay rent. Then, treat them as roommates. As of now, you aren't paying, so that is why you are getting treated as a maid. Adults pay their way in this world one way or another. The way your parents see it, that is your contribution to the house. However, if you start paying rent, then you are a tenant and are then contributing financially. (I will note that while cleaning might be reasonable considering you aren't paying, picking up your sister and taking care of her is not. That's your mother's responsibility.)\n\nTwo, move out and find a cheap room to rent. You're in college, right? Check student housing around the area and see if there is someone looking for a roomie.\n\nEdit:\nRead through the comments. OP pays wifi, utilities, and groceries. New judgment is OP is being taken advantage of and should absolutely move out. The parents are being unreasonable with the number of chores they are having her do.", "INFO:  Since you are an adult and are no longer your parents responsibility, how much do you pay for rent each month?", "I do have a job, I work with an engineer firm. But I do college too because they pay for it. I\u2019m not sure if I can do a full-time job plus college plus another job because with my job alone, I will not make enough just to support myself. I will either have to get a roommate or move in my with my bfs family.\n\n\nEDIT: just to clarify my job pays for college not my parents sorry for they confusion", "It's probably made up lol, I've literally never had that happen nor know anyone who has had that happen.", "Quite a bit easier doing everything for one person than 4\u2026 It doesn\u2019t seem like she struggles with doing them, but the workload itself. And in the case of roommates she\u2019d still get to at least split chores instead of doing absolutely everything.", "Umhum, if living alone how on Earth she would deal with NOT spending at least an hour everyday picking sis from school, poor thing, so not prepared to the real life... /s", "My parents don\u2019t pay for my college, my job does that, I do have a car I paid for it and while yes if I do move out I still have to do all those things the work load is less because it\u2019s just myself not myself and 3 other people", "OP, ignore this question. It's a terrible question, and it's irrelevant to how you're feeling.", "No and yes, I don\u2019t pay rent but I pay for water and electricity plus the wifi and I give $75 for groceries", "If it\u2019s becoming unbearable, perhaps it\u2019s time to explore these options.", "NTA. \n\nYou seriously need to think of some backup ideas and also go low contact with your family because they're taking advantage of you and honestly you are not a maid but a teenage girl who's working and going to school. \n\nBut if I may ask what do your parents do for a living that day either cannot afford a maid or they are basically pushing all the charge upon you besides cooking?", "No matter what you decide to do, please try to prioritise your studies. It will be the best way out to get far away from them in the long run. Your parents and family are indeed full of crap. They are only teaching you how to be lazy and to put the responsibilites on children. I wish you all the best!", "Move out! ASAP!", "A roomie would at least do half the chores or be more easily traded for one who will put in the effort.\n\nNTA. But please, seriously get a plan in place so you can move fast when you need to.", "Than get a roomate.", "Tbh if it's affecting you physically and mentally it's not worth it.", "Could you move into student accommodation or a house share with other students? This would be cheaper.", "Apologies then, it sounded like they paid for school from one of your comments. \n\nSo to summarize, you work full time, you cash flow school, you contribute bills, groceries, you pay for your own car and expenses, and you do the majority of the chores for 3 people. \n\nMaybe approach it mathematically? See what a room in a shared house is (and maybe it includes bills, it often does), you may find that it wouldn't cost your more than what you are currently contributing. Or maybe it's more but you'd have so much time freed that you could get studies done faster, or pick up some extra work that you get paid for.\n\nThen when you know where you stand on money, you'll have a better idea if you want to move out or not.\n\nYour parents woudln't really be able to argue it, as they seem to want to \"teach you responsibilities\". Surely moving out on your own and working/paying for school/managing your own life would mean they have \"taught you well\", right?\n\nIt's really about how you approach this and if you want to keep a relatiosnhip with your parents. Sometimes if you move out all the yellling/resentment on both sides goes away. Sometimes you realize there's no pleasing them and you save yourself years walking on eggshells", "They did answer. They\u2019re a freeloader", "That's rent.", "How is paying water, electricity, wifi and another $75 on top of that being a \"freeloader\"? On top of doing most of the household chores.

Adults have responsibilities", "And how much would you say is reasonable rent for someone renting a room from their parents?\n\nShe's got plenty of responsibilities. Far too many.", "I'm so done hearing, that kids need to pay rent for living at their home. My parents never asked for rent, and I did help them out, but OP parents is making her do anything because she is the \"oldest daughter\"?\nOP, run and don't look back. Go NC. You know what will happen if your parents will get older and more sick. You will be tied to them.", "She can\u2019t run an not look back, because guess what? She would have to PAY RENT!  \n\nAnd utilities, wifi, food and clean up after herself.\n\nTime to grow up", "Agree with you. She's going to college and working. Her parents should support that as well as they can. Sure, maybe they can't afford for her to live there for free without chipping in what she can, but having her do chores \"just because\" is horrible.", "It's different when you live with your parents and your parents doesn't do shit. She needs to move out.\nI'm not saying that by living alone she doesn't need to do things, but her parents aren't doing anything. This toxic \"paying rent at 18\" is getting out of hand. Then parents can cry to family why daughter is not talking to them. It's different to clean after herself or all fking family.", "College that her parents pay for!", "Excellent idea. I agree. She SHOULD move out and start living like an adult. Do mommy and daddy still have to pay for her college education?", "No, college that her *work* pays for."]}
