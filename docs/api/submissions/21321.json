Jane had a daughter Lucy who is 10 weeks younger than me. Because we were so close in age my dad and Jane found it \"fun\" to call us twins and to jokingly talk about us as though we were a pair. Lucy and I got along okay at first. But she always had anxiety and mental health issues and latched onto me. She confessed to me a few times that she liked being called my twin because it meant we would always be together and I would have to always act like a big brother to her. She even told me she was glad her dad died before she could get to know him because she knew I didn't love her or her mom and that my mom's death was the biggest reason. I used to find how she talked really weird. I tried to not let it come between us. But when we were 11/12 she told me to forget my mom existed and be glad she died because it meant a bigger family, I started to pull away from her. The reason she said it? She felt I should appreciate that having a bigger family with a sibling made her feel more secure. Her words really annoyed me and I lost all interest in trying to care about her then.\n\nI told dad and Jane over the years that them calling us twins bothered me. They brushed it off. Sometimes Jane would act annoyed, and maybe she was offended that it bothered me so much. It made me feel trapped. I said this in family therapy we all did when I was 15 and they were unhappy that I was ignoring Lucy by then and refusing to spend time with her as siblings or as friends. Family therapy was shitty.\n\nI began counting down the days to graduation when I was 14 and the day of my graduation I moved out of state with my grandmom and granddad for the summer. I also changed my college plans without telling my dad and I'll be going to community college and working.\n\nLucy and I were meant to be going to the same college. She's moving out soon. She'll be living on campus. Lucy wanted to come stay with me for a while before and for me to help her adjust to life away from home. Dad asked me about it when I didn't reply to Lucy. I told him my grandparents would not let her live here and I don't want to leave. We argued over it. I revealed I had changed my college plans. He brought up the twin thing and sacrificing Lucy's college experience. I told him that I am not a twin, never was a twin, and I am not willing to sacrifice my college experience for her. I told him I don't care if this means she won't be able to make it through college. I am not her keeper, I am not her friend and I am not going to take responsibility for her. My dad and Jane are angry, Lucy sent me a long text asking why I pulled away from her and why I won't be the big brother she needs.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1688488382, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14qjyzr/aita_for_telling_my_dad_i_am_not_a_twin_and_i/", "score": 81, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I dont know if she ever went to therapy, but I can't understand how you dad and stepmom thought that you needed family therapy when the problems has always been your step sister.\nIf i were you, i would have stopped talking to her the moment she told me I should be glad my mom was dead.\n\n>He brought up the twin thing and sacrificing Lucy's college experience.\n\nYour dad is sooo delusional. \nTell him he needs to go to therapy with his new family and to live you alone.\nBlock him if they continue to harass you.", "NTA.\n\nYou get to have a have and live an independent life too.", "NTA, good luck with college, hope you get your freedom and happiness away from this toxic mess.

Tell them it started when Lucy said she was glad your mother and her father died. That changed how you felt about her. That should shut your parents up for a while and make them realize Lucy is the problem.\n\nYou are a emotional support dog that bites.", "NTA....mostly. The reason I say mostly is that Lucy really does sound a bit fragile, and the whole situation is not her fault. Maybe--without compromising your plans in any way--try to be as kind to her as is reasonably possible. \n\nHaving said that you have every right to act as an independent adult. I am sick to death of reading about parents with kids remarrying and insisting that the kids participate wholeheartedly in whatever perfect Disney family fantasy the parents dream up. This twins nonsense is particularly egregious. And it is as unfair to Lucy as it is to you. So while maybe being kind to Lucy about the situation, giving your dad and Jane hell for it would not be at all out of line. Good luck!", "NTA - Good grief, your father and step-mother are treating you more like an emotional support animal, let alone a 'twin'.\n\nLucy's problems are very sad, however, by letting her focus on you rather than getting her help your parents have made the situation far worse than it needed to be.  This is not your problem and you are right to focus on your own future.  Keep your distance and enjoy your college days.", "nta your family sounds stressful as fuck", "YTA for holding a grudge about something that was said by an 11 or 12 year old. Seriously? You don\u2019t have to be your half sister\u2019s keeper, but the way you handled the situation was terrible, not informing your dad of the change in your college plans, trying to do it all in secret, when you knew it would all blow up once your plan was revealed. This just screams immaturity. Learn to communicate better, and telling you dad that being called \u201ctwins\u201d is not an example of good communication.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
