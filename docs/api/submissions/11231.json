Everyone and everything was where it was supposed to be, when it was supposed to be and if there were any issues, I didn't hear about it.\n\nMy older sister arrived a week and a half before the wedding and she's like a miniature tornado when she gets going.  She firmly told me not to worry about Lisa and that she would deal with her. I had no doubt about that.\n\nLisa brought up Chloe coming to the reception once again the day after I posted and my husband (I love seeing that :) ) and I told her that if she tried to bring Chloe in, the both of them would be removed. We didn't hear anything more from Lisa following that instance.\n\nA few people wondered what Chloe thought about it and she told us that she thinks adults are boring and she'd rather spend time with her cousins and other kids. So there's that.\n\nWhen my older brothers turned up a few days before the wedding, all of them were laughing about how my sister was doing her \"guard dog\" routine with Lisa and wasn't letting her anywhere near either of us or our mothers. My sister is tiny, 4'11\" and petite but a powerhouse behind it. It turned out that my sister was the one keeping her at bay and you can bet, she got a very large bottle of wine in thanks.\n\nFor my husband and I, the day was as close to perfect as it could get.  We only found out two days later that Lisa had tried to sneak Chloe into the reception and had been intercepted by all of my siblings (I have 6)  well before reaching the hall and had been told that she could either send Chloe upstairs with the other kids or they could both leaving the event completely.\n\nKnowing it would make her look bad and she'd never hear the end of it from her family, Lisa sent Chloe upstairs and has been sulking since.\n\nThere have been a few passive aggressive facebook posts which no one seems to care about but that's about it.\n\nSo, no epic temper tantrum, no forceful removals of irate sisters, just some words from my terrifying sister and that was that.  Everyone had a good time and when we went to check on them later, all the kids were passed out in positions that gave me aches and pains just from looking at them, so we know they had fun.\n\nI want to thank everyone again for their insight. It was very helpful and set me at ease that we wasn't in the wrong for sticking with our rule.", "created_utc": 1677698552, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11fdudj/update_aita_for_not_changing_our_wedding_rule_for/", "score": 51, "replies": ["Nice to see a good update. \n\nI have a feeling that Lisa will be a torn in your side for a long time to come, and setting up hard boundaries with her is a must. Without those she'd be happy to walk all over you and your husband.", "I\u2019m thinking your sister has a very profitable opportunity right in front of her. I know there are people who would love to outsource the entitled relative wrangling to someone, at least based on the number of times it comes up in this sub! Congrats on your wedding!", "Well the drama lover in me is disappointed that Lisa didn't rock up with Chloe dressed as a bridesmaid, but for you I'm so glad it worked out, that your siblings had your back and everyone enjoyed the celebration.", "You have great siblings OP. Happy your day went well."]}
