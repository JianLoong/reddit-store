Everyone and everything was where it was supposed to be, when it was supposed to be and if there were any issues, I didn't hear about it.\n\nMy older sister arrived a week and a half before the wedding and she's like a miniature tornado when she gets going.  She firmly told me not to worry about Lisa and that she would deal with her. I had no doubt about that.\n\nLisa brought up Chloe coming to the reception once again the day after I posted and my husband (I love seeing that :) ) and I told her that if she tried to bring Chloe in, the both of them would be removed. We didn't hear anything more from Lisa following that instance.\n\nA few people wondered what Chloe thought about it and she told us that she thinks adults are boring and she'd rather spend time with her cousins and other kids. So there's that.\n\nWhen my older brothers turned up a few days before the wedding, all of them were laughing about how my sister was doing her \"guard dog\" routine with Lisa and wasn't letting her anywhere near either of us or our mothers. My sister is tiny, 4'11\" and petite but a powerhouse behind it. It turned out that my sister was the one keeping her at bay and you can bet, she got a very large bottle of wine in thanks.\n\nFor my husband and I, the day was as close to perfect as it could get.  We only found out two days later that Lisa had tried to sneak Chloe into the reception and had been intercepted by all of my siblings (I have 6)  well before reaching the hall and had been told that she could either send Chloe upstairs with the other kids or they could both leaving the event completely.\n\nKnowing it would make her look bad and she'd never hear the end of it from her family, Lisa sent Chloe upstairs and has been sulking since.\n\nThere have been a few passive aggressive facebook posts which no one seems to care about but that's about it.\n\nSo, no epic temper tantrum, no forceful removals of irate sisters, just some words from my terrifying sister and that was that.  Everyone had a good time and when we went to check on them later, all the kids were passed out in positions that gave me aches and pains just from looking at them, so we know they had fun.\n\nI want to thank everyone again for their insight. It was very helpful and set me at ease that we wasn't in the wrong for sticking with our rule.", "created_utc": 1677698552, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11fdudj/update_aita_for_not_changing_our_wedding_rule_for/", "score": 846, "replies": ["Nice to see a good update. \n\nI have a feeling that Lisa will be a torn in your side for a long time to come, and setting up hard boundaries with her is a must. Without those she'd be happy to walk all over you and your husband.", "I\u2019m thinking your sister has a very profitable opportunity right in front of her. I know there are people who would love to outsource the entitled relative wrangling to someone, at least based on the number of times it comes up in this sub! Congrats on your wedding!", "Well the drama lover in me is disappointed that Lisa didn't rock up with Chloe dressed as a bridesmaid, but for you I'm so glad it worked out, that your siblings had your back and everyone enjoyed the celebration.", "You have great siblings OP. Happy your day went well.", "Augh i live for the tiny but mighty sisters in this world. Congratulations OP!", "We all need this sister in our families.", "Glad to read that everything went smoothly, and that your day was everything you wanted it to be. Many congratulations and best wishes for health and happiness in your future together!", "Nice to have a \"sibling army\" \ud83d\ude42", "Heh I'm four ft nine and my friends nicknamed me \"security\" because I was the person to be afraid of if you tried to fuck with someone. Glad your siblings had your back.", "Great update!!!! Love to hear it!", "Thanks for the update. Glad everything worked out & you had a great wedding. Congratulations", "Honestly? Your husband should have uninvited his sister, but let his niece come for the ceremony and to hang out with the cousin's. Glad it worked out well. Hopefully chloe won't take after her mom when she grows up.", "I'm actually wondering if that sister is willing to adopt another sister. She sounds awesome!", "omg I just want to say I love your terrifying older sister\n\nI am the terrifying older sister myself and at my own little sister's wedding rehearsal dinner, she couldn't get anyone to sit down for the dinner, so finally she just came over to me \"MAKE THEM SIT DOWN PLEEEEEEASE\"..... two minutes later, all rear ends were in seats! I'm a border collie (also pint size haha).\n\nLove it!", "Why in the world was she so hell bent on Chloe being there?", "Is your sister single and into ladies bc she sounds AMAZING!! Jk, sorta, but congrats on the wedding!!", "Poor chloe.", "Poor Chloe to have a mother like her. She would have been miserable being an only child at the reception.\n\nYour sister sounds amazing. Love that \ud83d\udd25!!", "I am glad that things went well! I am also from a large family. I use to say that I have 5 older brothers and 2 little sisters. It's the sisters you need to fear!", "I love Chloe's response.", "I love this. Your sister could make bank doing this for other couples hahaha", "This is epic. I want to hire your sister for family events if I ever decide to speak to them again \ud83d\ude02", "Can I just say, as a fellow younger sibling with a terrifying older sister, I love that your sister went to bat for you, as well as your other siblings. My sister would do the same in a situation like this, so, I kind of loved that part!", "Glad to hear that it worked out. Your siblings should start a wedding security team!", "Congratulations!! And hopefully this is the last time Lisa tries to throw a tantrum to get her way.", "Your siblings are amazing.", "Nice that everything turned out well.\n\nBut I really don't understand your SI's obsession to have Chloe with her all the time, especially as Chloe rather wished to stay with the other children herself. It sounds like your SIL is an extreme helicopter parent.", "Had to read the first, and want to say kudos to you for providing a place for the children while the adults had fun.  I always grumble at the no kids weddings I've been invited to because none of them have ever  set up something like that, and it can be difficult when the wedding is in strange / distant towns. \n\nAlso congrats to you on your wedding, this total post just got me smiling.  Kudos to your family for helping keep it running smoothly. And I hope you have a full and happy life together.", "Woof. Poor Chloe.", "Good best wishes and congratulations. \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89", "Good update", "I love a good update. Your siblings, especially your dachshund of a sister, are awesome. Congratulations on your marriage!!", "I am glad you had a nice wedding. \ud83d\ude04", "NTA - by any chance is Lisa from Texas? In particular, Houston?", "Team AITA prevails again and prevents another disaster from happening.", "Congratulations on your wedding I hope you and your husband a lifetime of love and happiness. I'm also glad your sister handled Lisa and also caught her when she was trying to be sneaky", "Personally I'm more concerned about Chloe. She's 11 and she sounds already exhausted by her mother's nonsense.", "Yes, it's a really good update\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d, and congrats op for your new married life", "I would hire her in a heartbeat!", "I worked retail, oldest of eight that I know of and have narcissists as family. I totally could do that. What is that job called?", "I have this sister. She's my big sis but terrifying, lol. At and solid 5 foot even and 110 pounds she scares many people and has a punch \ud83d\udc4a. I love my big sis \u2764.", "Man, I\u2019m capable of being a super stern, terrifying lady (learned from my 5\u20191\u201d mom\u2026) but I\u2019m too tall to be the pint sized terrifying one and I\u2019ve never been sad about it until this thread \ud83d\ude02", "I'm thinking it was more to do with being told \"no\" and less about her actually wanting her daughter there.", "I\u2019m concerned about both\u2026 poor Chloe, I hope she grows up to be more mature", "If you\u2019re the 1st person to charge for it, you get to name it \ud83d\ude06", "hahaha too funny! That's okay, you can look down fearsomely on others, that works very well", "She's probably more mature than her mother already."]}
