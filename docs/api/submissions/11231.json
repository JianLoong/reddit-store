Everyone and everything was where it was supposed to be, when it was supposed to be and if there were any issues, I didn't hear about it.\n\nMy older sister arrived a week and a half before the wedding and she's like a miniature tornado when she gets going.  She firmly told me not to worry about Lisa and that she would deal with her. I had no doubt about that.\n\nLisa brought up Chloe coming to the reception once again the day after I posted and my husband (I love seeing that :) ) and I told her that if she tried to bring Chloe in, the both of them would be removed. We didn't hear anything more from Lisa following that instance.\n\nA few people wondered what Chloe thought about it and she told us that she thinks adults are boring and she'd rather spend time with her cousins and other kids. So there's that.\n\nWhen my older brothers turned up a few days before the wedding, all of them were laughing about how my sister was doing her \"guard dog\" routine with Lisa and wasn't letting her anywhere near either of us or our mothers. My sister is tiny, 4'11\" and petite but a powerhouse behind it. It turned out that my sister was the one keeping her at bay and you can bet, she got a very large bottle of wine in thanks.\n\nFor my husband and I, the day was as close to perfect as it could get.  We only found out two days later that Lisa had tried to sneak Chloe into the reception and had been intercepted by all of my siblings (I have 6)  well before reaching the hall and had been told that she could either send Chloe upstairs with the other kids or they could both leaving the event completely.\n\nKnowing it would make her look bad and she'd never hear the end of it from her family, Lisa sent Chloe upstairs and has been sulking since.\n\nThere have been a few passive aggressive facebook posts which no one seems to care about but that's about it.\n\nSo, no epic temper tantrum, no forceful removals of irate sisters, just some words from my terrifying sister and that was that.  Everyone had a good time and when we went to check on them later, all the kids were passed out in positions that gave me aches and pains just from looking at them, so we know they had fun.\n\nI want to thank everyone again for their insight. It was very helpful and set me at ease that we wasn't in the wrong for sticking with our rule.", "created_utc": 1677698552, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11fdudj/update_aita_for_not_changing_our_wedding_rule_for/", "score": 3338, "replies": ["Nice to see a good update. \n\nI have a feeling that Lisa will be a torn in your side for a long time to come, and setting up hard boundaries with her is a must. Without those she'd be happy to walk all over you and your husband.", "I\u2019m thinking your sister has a very profitable opportunity right in front of her. I know there are people who would love to outsource the entitled relative wrangling to someone, at least based on the number of times it comes up in this sub! Congrats on your wedding!", "Well the drama lover in me is disappointed that Lisa didn't rock up with Chloe dressed as a bridesmaid, but for you I'm so glad it worked out, that your siblings had your back and everyone enjoyed the celebration.", "You have great siblings OP. Happy your day went well.", "Augh i live for the tiny but mighty sisters in this world. Congratulations OP!", "We all need this sister in our families.", "Glad to read that everything went smoothly, and that your day was everything you wanted it to be. Many congratulations and best wishes for health and happiness in your future together!", "Nice to have a \"sibling army\" \ud83d\ude42", "Heh I'm four ft nine and my friends nicknamed me \"security\" because I was the person to be afraid of if you tried to fuck with someone. Glad your siblings had your back.", "Great update!!!! Love to hear it!", "Thanks for the update. Glad everything worked out & you had a great wedding. Congratulations", "Honestly? Your husband should have uninvited his sister, but let his niece come for the ceremony and to hang out with the cousin's. Glad it worked out well. Hopefully chloe won't take after her mom when she grows up.", "I'm actually wondering if that sister is willing to adopt another sister. She sounds awesome!", "omg I just want to say I love your terrifying older sister\n\nI am the terrifying older sister myself and at my own little sister's wedding rehearsal dinner, she couldn't get anyone to sit down for the dinner, so finally she just came over to me \"MAKE THEM SIT DOWN PLEEEEEEASE\"..... two minutes later, all rear ends were in seats! I'm a border collie (also pint size haha).\n\nLove it!", "Why in the world was she so hell bent on Chloe being there?", "Is your sister single and into ladies bc she sounds AMAZING!! Jk, sorta, but congrats on the wedding!!", "Poor chloe.", "Poor Chloe to have a mother like her. She would have been miserable being an only child at the reception.\n\nYour sister sounds amazing. Love that \ud83d\udd25!!", "I am glad that things went well! I am also from a large family. I use to say that I have 5 older brothers and 2 little sisters. It's the sisters you need to fear!", "I love Chloe's response.", "I love this. Your sister could make bank doing this for other couples hahaha", "This is epic. I want to hire your sister for family events if I ever decide to speak to them again \ud83d\ude02", "Can I just say, as a fellow younger sibling with a terrifying older sister, I love that your sister went to bat for you, as well as your other siblings. My sister would do the same in a situation like this, so, I kind of loved that part!", "Glad to hear that it worked out. Your siblings should start a wedding security team!", "Congratulations!! And hopefully this is the last time Lisa tries to throw a tantrum to get her way.", "Your siblings are amazing.", "Nice that everything turned out well.\n\nBut I really don't understand your SI's obsession to have Chloe with her all the time, especially as Chloe rather wished to stay with the other children herself. It sounds like your SIL is an extreme helicopter parent.", "Had to read the first, and want to say kudos to you for providing a place for the children while the adults had fun.  I always grumble at the no kids weddings I've been invited to because none of them have ever  set up something like that, and it can be difficult when the wedding is in strange / distant towns. \n\nAlso congrats to you on your wedding, this total post just got me smiling.  Kudos to your family for helping keep it running smoothly. And I hope you have a full and happy life together.", "Woof. Poor Chloe.", "Good best wishes and congratulations. \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89", "Good update", "I love a good update. Your siblings, especially your dachshund of a sister, are awesome. Congratulations on your marriage!!", "I am glad you had a nice wedding. \ud83d\ude04", "NTA - by any chance is Lisa from Texas? In particular, Houston?", "Team AITA prevails again and prevents another disaster from happening.", "Congratulations on your wedding I hope you and your husband a lifetime of love and happiness. I'm also glad your sister handled Lisa and also caught her when she was trying to be sneaky", "Personally I'm more concerned about Chloe. She's 11 and she sounds already exhausted by her mother's nonsense.", "Yes, it's a really good update\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d, and congrats op for your new married life", "I would hire her in a heartbeat!", "I worked retail, oldest of eight that I know of and have narcissists as family. I totally could do that. What is that job called?", "I have this sister. She's my big sis but terrifying, lol. At and solid 5 foot even and 110 pounds she scares many people and has a punch \ud83d\udc4a. I love my big sis \u2764.", "Man, I\u2019m capable of being a super stern, terrifying lady (learned from my 5\u20191\u201d mom\u2026) but I\u2019m too tall to be the pint sized terrifying one and I\u2019ve never been sad about it until this thread \ud83d\ude02", "I'm thinking it was more to do with being told \"no\" and less about her actually wanting her daughter there.", "I\u2019m concerned about both\u2026 poor Chloe, I hope she grows up to be more mature", "If you\u2019re the 1st person to charge for it, you get to name it \ud83d\ude06", "hahaha too funny! That's okay, you can look down fearsomely on others, that works very well", "She's probably more mature than her mother already.", "This was exhausting. How many times does your SIL have to be told no? And to try to sneak Chloe in anyway? Especially when Chloe wanted to be with her cousins?\n\nI predict that SIL is having a power play with you. She will keep pushing your boundaries until you make her feel like she is Queen Bee and won.", "Sounds like you have some great siblings :) and congratulations on the marriage!", "\u201cI love seeing that\u201d you\u2019re so cute I wish you nothing but the best!

So awesome.", "This entire thing should have been stopped with a final, \"My *own* fucking son is not coming to the reception, why on fucking Earth do you think you are entitled to an exception?

Why did it mean s9oooooo much to Lisa to have Chloe there?", "Do you rent your sister out?", "Your sister can totally take a side gig doing this for others and making huge bucks.", "What exactly was Lisa's intention?  Did she really think a little kid would be that interested in a wedding reception?  Like OP said before, Chloe would rather be with the other kids.\n\nI've been to weddings as a child.  I don't recall them being particularly fun or memorable.  I was probably bored, or just drinking as many Shirley Temples as the bar would allow.  Unlike movies and TV shows might suggest, kids aren't actually that mature or aware of why adults care about weddings.", "I'm wondering this too. Who uses their child as a pawn like this", "Weird power play comes to mind.", "I wish I had this sister. I have a Lisa who is used to getting her way.", "A narcissist. Other people are just props in their fairy tale life.", "Kids with parents like that tend to learn early on that their parent is more of a child than they are.", "That's okay, you can look down fearsomely on others, that works very well", "My friends call me a pit bull. Their favourite activity is bringing me to specialist medical appointments. I am the scary 5'\u00bd\" cripple of many doctors' nightmares. \ud83d\ude08", "Sounds awful", "Look fearsomely at others, either straight in the face or every so slightly upward \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udcaa", "I feel like when you have kids of super immature parents they grow up to be either mini-me's of their parents, or recognize that the parent will never be an adult and end up being more mature to minimize drama", "Is your sister single and into ladies bc she sounds AMAZING!!", "Glad to read that everything went smoothly,", "Hey, you\u2019ve just described my SIL and my nieces! SIL is just like her mom. My nieces are super mature.", "Ngl also just looking in a mirror \ud83e\udd23", "Love a good terrifying sister", "YEAH!!! Thanks for the update. Your sister and siblings sound amazing. Congrats :)", "NTA. I don\u2019t understand when people get butt hurt about childless weddings. You would think couples would want to enjoy a night without their kids.", "Your sister should start a side business keeping people\u2019s problematic relatives at bay. Like a tiny wedding bouncer.", "Your powerhouse sister sounds phenomenal!! Your brothers too!!!\n\nEdited to says: Congratulations to the Newlyweds!!!", "You went above and beyond providing childcare. The kid was fine not going...I wonder why the mother has such separation anxiety.", "Your siblings are heroic.", "Nice! Congrats!\n\nSome things are just not appropriate for kids to see or be around. Plus you offered childcare?!? No brainer, drop the munchkin off and relax for a bit :3", "Good for you and that steady spine of yours. Your new husband has a sturdy spine too. Glad to know your now SIL got kept in check. I hope Chloe had a good time with her cousins. I hope the adults had a great time at your reception. Congratulations on your marriage, best wishes to you and your husband and may your years together be long and full of joy, peace, happiness & contentment.", "It's so nice to hear your wedding and reception went off without a hitch. Congratulations to you and your husband. \ud83d\ude00", "OP's sister could have a great career as a professional wedding bouncer for people who want a childfree wedding. After all, at almost any childfree wedding, there will be one or two parents who will try to sneak their child in.\n\nMy girlfriend and I don't want to get married for feminist reasons, we have a civil partnership... But if we would want to get married, we totally would have hired OP's sister.", "She wanted to feel special and above the rules. She didn't care what anyone else wanted, including her daughter, as long as she was singled out as more important than everyone else.", "I think it's about being told 'no'. She was like: \"I'm told that I can't bring my daughter? I guess we'll see about that.\" This woman wanted to 'win'.\n\nAnd when an event is childfree, parents constantly assume that their child is special, and that the rules don't apply to their child.\n\n\"No kids allowed.\"\n\n\"Yeah, but this is my child!\"\n\n\"Yes, and she's a child.\"\n\n\"Yeah, but this is my child! My child!\"", "I mean, no kid of that age wants to be the ONLY kid at an adult function! She'd be bored out of her mind! What in gods name is her mother thinking!", "Oldest daughter, four little siblings, raised by a narc/enabler combo and working two retail jobs currently. If you choose to franchise this endeavour please let me know, I'm going to open up the Aussie branch.", "Props to your sister.\n\nNever mess with short women, they're closer to your kneecaps.", "Great update. Your siblings are very cool. Congratulations on your wedding!", "wait, the kid didn't even want to be there but Lisa was still trying to make her go?", "Marvelous! So happy you and your new hubby had a magnificent and stress free (as much as weddings can be, I mean) day! Send your sister our admiration! Well done!", "such awesome siblings to act as bouncers for you. Glad every Turn out well for you.", "I really like this update. My fiance and I are considering the same thing. It's absolutely important that my SD6 is with us for our ceremony and dinner. But I suggested that due to there not being many children in our families that we have an event mainly for the adults afterwards. Of course we will hire a babysitter and ensure the kids are all safe. \n\nI vaguely brought this up to my SDs mum what my fiance and I were thinking and she kinda said to just let SD be at the adults only part to let her dance etc as she's used to being the only kid. I get that but I'm not comfortable with my future SD  being around alcohol and roudy adults. My partner understands and respects that.", "Congratulations on your wedding. May you, both, have a long and happy marriage.", "Same. While I'm childfree myself, I've heard enough about childfree weddings that I know it's a hassle for parents to find childcare. By providing it, that neatly keeps that expense off the parents (and makes it likelier that they'll attend). I come from a huge family and for a lot of us, many of the people who'd be providing the childcare would also be attending the wedding and reception. If I find the right guy and we decide to go the child-free route, I'll definitely have that as part of the draw for the wedding.", "About herself.  Only herself.  That's what she's thinking.", "Let's be perfectly honest...that's not exactly a high bar to reach is it.", "My family, and sometimes strangers, always thought I was more mature than my mother so, yeah that has been my experience.", "Same. My niece is amazing. She sometimes has whisper the rubbish that comes out of her mothers mouth because she doesn\u2019t believe it / want to repeat it / believe her mother lies so much. \n\nIt\u2019s sad \n\nBut at least my niece is amazing", "Your family rock op congrats \ud83c\udf89", "I'm glad your wedding turned out so well, OP. \n\nYour older sister sounds a lot like mine. My sister is about 5' tall, and she's terrifying when she gets angry. No one stands in her way when she is fighting a perceived wrong. I often wonder what we would do without her.", "How do I adopt you and your siblings, OP? \u263a\ufe0f Only child here with no siblings.\n\nI\u2019m glad you got to enjoy your wedding and reception the way you wanted it \ud83e\udd70", "I remember this post and was excited to hear about your tiny and formidable sister reigning Lisa in. It sounds like Lisa is the problem not poor Chloe. I'm so glad the kid had fun, you and your husband had a perfect wedding and Lisa got denied at every turn! Glad you have great siblings. Congratulations on your marriage btw!", "So the kids were just upstairs??? What is up with this woman!! Glad you had a nice day...enjoy your marriage!", "Bouncer, FAFO edition.", "She wasn't thinking about anything except herself.", "I will never understand how kids can fall asleep in such awkward positions - and so quickly! Last night, I was making myself and my kids pre-bed milkshakes. My 2 year old daughter was sitting on the couch, awake, when I walked into the kitchen. Five minutes later when I returned with the shakes, she was out cold. I'm so fucking jealous.", "Your sister sounds absolutely badass.", "I had a mother like Lisa. I was used as an invasive prop and it got worse as I became a teenager and really just wanted to be with my brothers or friends. It sucks. You saved Chloe. Thank you.", "I\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t bend on this. Lisa will be ALRIGHT! I cant believe she still tried to sneak her daughter in\ud83d\ude02 The commitment!", "After reading both posts my only question is why does she feel like the daughter needs or wants to be there, it really doesn't make sense why she would insist on it, at least I can't figure a reason. Some people are just crazy, I guess.", "The hired mama grizzly?", "Absolutely! And she was never going to win with a \u201cmy child is super special so should be the exception\u201d argument when the only child at the event who could have possibly been special enough was OP\u2019s son. And he was probably the reason OP\u2019s planning included children at the ceremony and then setting up a party room for the kids to play during the reception. Which was a great idea because that sounds way more fun for the kids.", "My sister is like that too. Called the pitbull at work by her older male coworkers who send her at the most difficult undercontractors  (she works at the traffic office, building roads, tunnels, that sort of thing). Don't try and cheap out with tax payer money when my sis is around. Then put love on the mix for when family members need help, and she's unstoppable. \nSorry, gonna stop bragging now. But I'm very proud of my sister!"]}
