You want to put controls on your child there are settings that say after 10 they can not use the apps or phone. It\u2019s automatic and her phone goes into do not disturb mode.  Problem solved.

How to get your kid to resent you 101. She is doing the right things and you are not responding to that behavior. You are punishing her instead??? Make it make sense. I remember these kids in high school. They COULD NOT WAIT to get the hell away from their parents. That is the relationship you are molding. \n\nI find it really weird that your 15 year old\u2026who is in her \u201cpracticing adulthood\u201d era has a bed time. I was almost never done with my work by 2130 too so that\u2019s a lot of pressure on your kid. \n\nThis is the time where she needs to figure out her own needs and learn the skills to manage her time and sleep. You are a bit overbearing.\n\nEDIT: I\u2019d also like to add that if you come to your senses about the bedtime thing\u2026you have to be patient dude. She has been living with a stupid early bedtime and will now get to explore other options. It\u2019s completely possible she may make a mistake and stay up too late. That DOES NOT mean you implement the bedtime again.

After dinner they clean up and at 7:30 they are allowed to get on their electronics for the rest of their evening. It's worked well for everyone. Sometimes we aren't the cool parents but we want them to not rely on electronics to entertain them. We have had some great conversations as a family and love to play board games together.

Oh wait, having known a lot of teachers I definitely can.\n\n\nThere is a reason why people say that whose who can't do something teach it. You're certainly a great example of that.", "School isn't set up for teens either. But that doesn't matter, school is meant mostly as a daycare for working parents and so it coincides with work hours.", "You want to bring biology into this? Teens need a good 8-10 hours of sleep every night. If school starts at 8, and she has to get up at 6 or 7, 10 is a perfectly reasonable and sane bed time.", "I usually didn\u2019t sleep at ten either, just saying that it would\u2019ve been the healthy thing to do. Fortunately homework wasn\u2019t a problem for me either.", "Honestly I didn't read that part. I googled it and the first response said between 10-11 which was what OP said lights out time was. If your asking do I interact differently on an anonymous message board making ridiculous value judgments on other people's lives, then yea I do.", "Tbh I don't really care i just don't think disallowing cellphones from the bedroom and making kids go to bed earlier is a big deal. It's probably good for them.", "Homework *now* almost always includes screen time, especially for high schoolers.  My kids use their laptops plus their phones for researching stuff.", "It\u2019s a completely different day now though.", "Back in our day they told us that we couldn\u2019t use calculators bc we \u201cwouldn\u2019t have one with us at all times.\u201d If you turn your iphone sideways, the calculator literally turns into a graphing calculator. Times change, things are different. \n\nLord I wish back in my day we could use phones and the internet instead of looking through 3 different encyclopedias for information on research projects lol. If you don\u2019t understand a math problem you can find that one Indian guy on YouTube who teaches you how to do it better than your math teachers probably.", "Your day is looooooooooong over. Adapt or stop pretending your takes mean anything in the modern day.", "My son's computer and playstation in his bedroom. He tends to have a playstation session 9pm-11pm (he's 17) with his mates and is up for 7am the next day for college. No problems here with it.", "It is but it is unlikely she will get the sleep. I'm a big supporter of later High School opening times, which I understand isn't the standard anywhere.\n\nI think a 10pm bedtime is a bit early still, since I at least would just sit for hours with my 10pm bed time as a teen, without books, phone, computer, tv still ending up with 5 hours of sleep and less time to get things done. It is a tough balance.", "That doesn\u2019t mean teens are TIRED at 10. The comment you replied to specifically says teens are not biologically set up for early bed times and that\u2019s true. You\u2019re talking about total hours of sleep when the topic is what time they go to sleep. We make kids go to school too early Plain and simple.", "Their bodies are wired to stay up late and wake up late. We are failing them by forcing them to wake up so early. That doesn\u2019t mean they should be punished further.\n\nI\u2019m 32 and my work day starts at 9:30. I would never take a job that wanted me there at 7, I would be exhausted. It\u2019s unreasonable to expect that of teens.", "Why do you act differently on a message board than afk? I\u2019m always the same.", "You must be a pisspoor teacher because you can't separate two very different things, nor are capable of following a very basic line of logic to the degree that you posted a \"roast\" link that supported the person's actual argument.\n\nFurther what kind of classes are you teaching where the student does not use a laptop? Because it make it sound like you're teaching preschool. And no dissing that, but teens are very different from 5yos.", "Don\u2019t you think lights out at 10 for a 15 year old is early? I agree with the cellphone aspect just not bedtime", "My alarm includes screen time now. How wake up if not to the dulcet tones of \"Chrissy wake up\".", "Thankfully, I have no need to adapt my high school studying habits since, as you say, they are long behind me.", "Consistency is what matters most in my experience. When I was in high school I went to bed at 8:30 and woke up at 5:00 for morning swim practice. I was still able to fall asleep each night because that was what my sleep routine was. If I had stayed up past 10:00 I would have been sleep deprived every single day and that would have impacted my academic performance.", "School does absolutely start too early, but that's not changing any time soon, so if we're going to point out that teens are biologically set up for early bed times, it seems fair to also point out that biologically they need 8-10 hours of sleep, which is achievable with a 10 PM bedtime while we can't achieve earlier school times without a massive overhaul of our system.", "When you get into a routine your body adapts.  And yes I know about the circadian rhythm differences in teens vs adults. The world however doenst revolve around those sleep patterns, unfortunately. As a night owl it sucks to have to go to bed at 10 (i have to as an adult) but I do because im a teacher and I have to be at school by 8.", "I had a job for a couple years where I had to wake up at 4:30am. I never adjusted to it, and it damaged my mental and physical health.", "Homework is not that bad in highschool.", "I mean it kind of supported both their arguments... Teens naturally sleep later, but tech in the bedroom before sleep isn't good either", "If they have to be up at 6, that's 8 hours of sleep.  It's not healthy for teens to get less than that.  What should really happen is school start times should be later for highschool, so that teens could sleep from 11-7 or 12-8, then it would match better with many teens natural circadian rhythms", "I think kids stay up too late and don't get enough sleep. It might be 30 mins too early but 11 pm is too late IMO. School starts at 8 am here and students should be getting 8.5 - 9.5 hours of sleep a night.", "Chrissy wake up.\n\nI don't like this\n\nChrissy wake up\n\nhey hellllooooo", "You just don't want your kid to stop relying on you, if you baby them til they move out then you gotta do it the rest of your life. A 15 should be able to regulate their own sleep.", "Ni, you definitely should. The whole \"8hrs of sleep\" thing has been proven incorrect anyway. I have slept 4-6hrs a night, every night, since age 10. I was a straight A/B student (although to be fair school came naturally so I almost never had to study cuz I paid attention during class). I still, at 5 days away from age 40, only require 4-6hrs of sleep. I'm never tired during the day, I'm active, etc. I'd rather sleep 1/4th of my life away. The rest of you can go ahead and sleep 1/3rd of your life away if you like. Lol \n\nWhat I am saying is we are all different. Sure, if the kids are awake at 7am at least for their 730am vlass then I get it, 10 is late in that respect. But in today's world, time is so taken advantage of that I can sltotally see kids who get up to get ready for school at say 6am. Get out at 2pm-3pm, have sports practice after school til say 5 or 6pm. Get home and eat. Do homework. It's already 9pm right there. A kid cannot do purely academic studies/sport8ng activities 7 days a week (cuz weekends always had homework and if they're in sports, they have games/meets).", "And research has shown circadian rhythms for teens are significantly different than for adults or younger kids, and that school starting at 8 should be abolished as teens can\u2019t get enough sleep even if they go to bed earlier. School for teens should start 9 - 9.30 at the earliest. Saying they should just go to bed earlier is ignoring the science.", "Time to wake up time to wake up! The instructions are in the song!", "That's a pretty massive assumption based on one comment. Of course I want my kid to stop relying on me; that's how I'll know I raised a functional adult.", "I mean you can do that, but if I get 4-6 hours a night for too long, I start seeing spiders so I will pass :P"]}
