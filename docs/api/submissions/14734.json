Here's why. \n\nYour rule is contradictory and illogical. \n\nYou state that she brought a D up to a B. Her reward for this?

You want to put controls on your child there are settings that say after 10 they can not use the apps or phone. It\u2019s automatic and her phone goes into do not disturb mode.  Problem solved.

How to get your kid to resent you 101. She is doing the right things and you are not responding to that behavior. You are punishing her instead??? Make it make sense. I remember these kids in high school. They COULD NOT WAIT to get the hell away from their parents. That is the relationship you are molding. \n\nI find it really weird that your 15 year old\u2026who is in her \u201cpracticing adulthood\u201d era has a bed time. I was almost never done with my work by 2130 too so that\u2019s a lot of pressure on your kid. \n\nThis is the time where she needs to figure out her own needs and learn the skills to manage her time and sleep. You are a bit overbearing.\n\nEDIT: I\u2019d also like to add that if you come to your senses about the bedtime thing\u2026you have to be patient dude. She has been living with a stupid early bedtime and will now get to explore other options. It\u2019s completely possible she may make a mistake and stay up too late. That DOES NOT mean you implement the bedtime again.

I managed my own bed time and it was my responsibility to make sure I got up in the morning and on the bus on time.

My kids spend the last 30 minutes of their evening reading, drawing, etc to help them get ready for sleep.\n\nWe have a bed time rule. If you are in high school, during the school week, electronics are turned off and put away by 10 PM. Lights are off by 10:30. Middle school is 9:30 and 10. Everyone gets an extra hour during weekend/holidays. \n\nA week may be too long of a consequence. If my kids don't comply and it takes them an additional 30 minutes to put it away, they lose 30 minutes of electronics. The punishment fits the crime. \n\nWe also don't allow them to be on electronics all the time. They can go outside, do homework (electronics only for school), paint, read, play games until dinner. After dinner they clean up and at 7:30 they are allowed to get on their electronics for the rest of their evening. It's worked well for everyone. Sometimes we aren't the cool parents but we want them to not rely on electronics to entertain them. We have had some great conversations as a family and love to play board games together. I contribute this for making sure there is time where all electronics (including my spouses and mine) are nowhere in sight.", "Hmm. NAH.

But if she's upped her grades, you can afford to be more lenient as a reward.", "YTA- not because of the rule (Personally I think everyone should leave their phones downstairs after 10pm.

It's a necessary life skill, and OP is depriving that from her daughter. \n\nSure, she's likely to make mistakes and stay up too late resulting in waking up late or being groggy all day  - that's a vital part of learning ones own body, internal clock, and the limits of sleep deprivation.
