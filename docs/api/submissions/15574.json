Unfortunately that ship has sailed, and at this point you're just going to need to take the risk.\n\nSit down with her and explain that since accidents with nuts keep happening you can't have her live here any longer.  It's putting your health in danger and preventing you from being able to look after your own children.  As such your friend needs to find a new living situation since this one is clearly not working out.

If they won't get rid of the nuts, you get rid of the family.", "NTA.\n\n\nI suspect she started out respecting your food allergies, but then started adding allergens slowly, watching to see whether it triggered your response. When you didn't go into immediate anaphylactic shock, she figured it wasn't a big deal. So she started bring more reactive food in. Since you haven't dropped dead yet, she isn't taking it seriously. So now you're living with a woman who doesn't respect your minimal but life-threatening requests, and who thinks she is allowed to judge what is a \"bad enough\" reaction.\n\n\nThere may not be malice involved, but it blatantly obvious, and escalating.\n\n\nYou are risking your life, and your children's welfare by allowing her to be there one more minute. She is a hazard, and needs to go. Sooner rather than later.\n\n\nThe friendship is already gone, and she is the one who destroyed it. In your own house, and to your face. You need to get angry. Why aren't you angry?", "NTA - you have to advocate for your own health and your own family.  If this woman is truly a friend she will understand.  Maybe give her an extended amount of time to move out and make it very clear in the meantime that the food guidelines must be followed. No more excuses on the food.  It should have already been communicated that these foods are restricted and if they want to eat nuts they can do it outside the home.  Also, she should be cleaning up her own messes in the home.

How long until living at your home gets tight and then impossible for you?  \nPrepare a 30 day notice you only need to fill the date in and sign, show her and tell her the next time there are nuts in the house you'll finish the notice and hand her.", "NTA\n\nWhat if you just gave your friend a final warning?

She is not your friend.", "You need to kick this selfish, insensitive mooch out immediately.", "I do allow my kids to have peanut butter in a jar in the pantry, but it's not used with all the pots, pans etc and they hardly ever eat it. This however has reached the stage that i literally cannot go to the fridge and eat something, because, 9/10, it's going to have some sort of nuts in it unless it's a generic ordered pizza. so my system is totally overwhelmed at the moment.", "I don't think she is, but it's difficult to make a lot of changes to diets and it's easier if i'm the one making the changes. Which would mean i stop eating in the house completely. Which i have to do this week to try and calm my system down.", "This isn't the first time. I had to not eat entirely for a week previously to try and calm my system down before i knew i'd start going into shock. I just had water, tea and broth when at work. \n\nI'm trying to weigh up the 'totally doesn't give a fuck' to the 'this is really difficult to manage', and i think maybe she didn't think it would be this difficult for her to cut out a food group going into it.", "right, lol, that too.", "That's what i think also. It's been eight months now, and it's kinda getting worse.

It feels really depressing.", "I sincerely hope that isn't the case, and I think i'm going to sit down with her this week when the kids are at their dads' and explain this isn't working. Give her until the end of the summer, and just stop eating in the house until then.", "yeah, i don't think there's malice there, but a decision that i don't appear that sick, so it must not be that bad, or this is what they eat, so i should just stay away from it, but it's starting to be a lot, and it just feels like a giant 'fuck you'.", "That's the thing, it was already a massive thing before they moved in, so it wasn't new information. I will admit that i sometimes will eat something that could have coconut etc in it by accident, not ever on purpose, but if it's few and far between, it'll be a headache at most. it's when i get overloaded, i start with fatigue, headaches, and eventually hospital visits. It's the exact same route each time, and she knows it. I know it's hard to stop using something you're used to, but i feel so confused at the moment from not feeling well, that i don't know if i'm thinking straight or overreacting.", "She works from home, and is working when my kids finish school. So i pay someone to make them dinner, do their homework and watch them for the 3 hours until i get home.", "I wouldn't ever kick someone out with kids without a warning. I do want to try and end the living arrangements amicably, and like someone mentioned above; just explain that emotionally living with another family is not working, and hope it doesn't blow up the friendship.", "Yeah, so that's the thing. My immune system gets so overwhelmed that i then start getting sick from by-products, and that's when the real scary stuff happens. and that's where we are now. So even just constantly cooking stuff with coconut in the house, and the residue of it on the plates etc is enough to make me sick. for me alone with my own kids, it was completely manageable, but i think it's just a lot harder for her than she realized because they drink almond milk (which is the largest allergen i have and absolutely will kill me), and nut butter/cheeses. so those items are not byproducts and just sitting open in the fridge with stuff i could possibly eat.", "i don't know if i'm going to mention the allergies as the reason. Simply because it's been such a long time now, and we've discussed it so many times, that to discuss it again only means i'm opening the door to start this 'i'll stop doing it', when in reality it doesn't, and it will cause resentment, that there's no salvaging a thing, and everything will end on a bad note.", "I do, i love her and her kids, and I know she isn't intentionally hurting me, but she's also being super careless and if anyone has to change their life, it's going to have to be me. I already went through this anxiety where i was afraid to eat at home and it did a lot to my mental health, that i do not want to be in that dark place again.", "That was the issue with mt ex husband, he literally was buying nuts and putting it into the food. ergo the massive amounts of trauma i have around this, so i'm hyper-sensitive to the whole thing. I keep saying that it's the overwhelming to my system is the problem, the repeated daily exposure is an issue, but it always comes back to how sometimes i won't check labels. Which is fine, IF, IF... i am not having daily repeated exposure to foods that will kill me.", "Yeah, i pay someone to come to clean the house, but that is really unfair to make that person do that and be in the house with the people whose food they are throwing out, while i'm away at work.

You\u2019ll have to decide. Not letting them bring in anything with nuts when your kids can have peanut butter from the pantry is probably a bit confusing though.", "No, it's not difficult.  It's ONE food group and she is living in your home rent free.  \n\nFuck her, I wouldn't even give her another chance, she clearly is lazy and  doesn't care about your health, WTF leaving you her dirty, contaminated dishes and making you sick.\n\nGive her notice and get her out the damn door.

I have been dealing with alot of issues for over a year and finally after about 6 weeks I am starting to have a bit more energy.  I don't think that you are over-reacting...it can be depressing to feel so badly for such a long time.  I think that you should try to talk to her to let her know that you are committed to doing whatever you need to do in order to start feeling better.  Let her know that under no circumstances (i.e. ex husband brought the food, child brought the food home) can you have these items in the home anymore.  Let her know that you understand if she needs to move out, if she's not willing to restrict these items and be more vigilant, this way she understands that it's a hard line that you don't want crossed.  Hopefully she will get the hint.  If not then you need to give her the boot and, of course, if you feel you have already communicated this enough times, just ask her to move out.  Let her know you value the friendship, but you won't put their wellbeing above yours.", "This is actually horrifying. So NTA if you kicked those people out. That woman does not care about your well-being, especially if she is well aware of your history. She is taking advantage of you.

You are not safe in your own home and that is a dealbreaker.\n\nI am so sorry.", "oh, we talked about it extensively. it's worked like this for years with my kids and the peanut butter. It's now just that butters, sauces, creams, salad dressings, cooked food, so all cooking utensils, the air fryer is so off limits now, i cannot eat a thing that comes out of it. I can 100% eliminate the peanut butter from the pantry, they barely eat it anyway, but as it stands. I cannot eat in the house and be well.", "That's kinda where I am also. I am making all the concessions, and the balance of it is wearing really thin. Throw in my mental and physical health, and i just do not want to do it anymore", "oh im sorry, i didn't mean to argue. I just don't think she's trying to do that. I do know this isn't a liveable situation, especially not long term, my health can't take it. It's just one of those rock and a hard place", "Yeah, i get it. I did want to see if i was being melodramatic about the whole thing, asking someone to leave the house is a big deal, and wanted to make sure that i'm not just making some snap decision that is wholly unfair.", "That's the thing, i feel like it's been talked to death already, and i brought it up last night, it was nearly a denial that she brings anything into the house, her ex husband made the food for her kids and brought it over. I knew there and then, that this wasn't ever going to be an apology and it wasn't going to change. It would just be a fight. I did end it with how it's affecting my mental health now, and she didn't respond. We haven't spoken today. \n\nI'm not asking someone else to manage my health, but if you simply absolutely cannot go without this food, it needs to be elsewhere. not being cooked in the kitchen i use, in the air, on the furniture , on all the cutlery, the cooking utensils, the sink and then for me to clean.

If they visit, I buy the specific prepackaged items they\u2019ve told me they can eat. \n\nIf I had to move into one of their homes, there are entire foods I\u2019d stop cooking/eating at their home. If I somehow had to make something with forbidden ingredients, I\u2019d do my best to make a containment area to prepare it in and clean thoroughly afterwards.", "I\u2019m worried that Your organs are going to start shutting down if you don\u2019t do anything. Straight up.", "You took her in and she's poisoned you multiple times.  Don't leave _your_ children without a mother to accommodate this person's options.", "NTA. She is blowing things up by not caring about your life threatening allergies. It's more than reasonable for you to say you won't put up with it anymore.", "Here's the thing... its headed towards their negligence causing you to be hospitalized or even die from the severeness of your allergies. If so, who is paying rent? She is out on her ass anyways. \n\nThere really is no good deed that goes unpunished. That saying is so true. \n\nNTA and you need to 100% blow up the friendship and get them out of your house. She does not value your safety or health, she is not your friend. Stop thinking about her and her kids and prioritize your own. They need their mother around.", "Now you know why she's getting divorced. She doesn't care about any ne byt herself. \n\nYou are doing her a huge favor by letting her live with you rent-free. And she is making you sick because she just doesn't give a shit. She is not your friend.  NTA", "INFO: Have you sat her down and explained how close you are to losing it? Have you said something like: \"I simply cannot live like this any longer. You have repeatedly endangered my health by [list *everything* she and/or her kids have done, including leaving contaminated dishes for you to clean, and rendering certain appliances unusable for you]. You now have two choices: (1) You and your kids need to find somewhere else to live, now; or (2) *All* of this stops right now, you make it crystal clear to your ex and your kids that no food with nuts will be allowed to enter this house, and you ensure that neither you nor your kids *ever* breaks that rule, because if any of you do, you will all have to move out immediately.\"", "You are literally gonna die probably if you let this woman stay. You might as well have stayed married if that\u2019s what you are gonna do.  Ntah get her out your kids need you", "it seems like you\u2019re a kind person to a fault. being passive isn\u2019t a good quality at all. it\u2019s seems like your \u201cfriend\u201d is the kind of person that search for hyper-empathetic and passive people so they can \u201ctest\u201d them. idk if you said it in a comment or your original post but her slowly buying more and more nut products, despite knowing everything, is her testing ur limits to see how far she can take. idk if you\u2019re too emotionally invested in your friendship or care too deeply for her but if you can\u2019t stand up for yourself, please be a role model for your children. \n\nkids are not that dumb, in fact, they are very aware of what is going on. even if your kids don\u2019t know the entirety of what is going on between you and your \u201cfriend,\u201dthey know about your allergy and are witnessing a \u201cclose friend\u201d knowingly poison you and then make you clean up the mess. \ndo you want your kids to be pushovers? if your kid had a nut allergy and they\u2019re friend at school was pulling stunts like this, would you be ok with that? should your kids accept mistreatment because they know someone on a personal level? \n\nif you can\u2019t kick this nut-munching freakazoid out in good conscious, don\u2019t do it for yourself. do it for your kids. they will learn by example to always advocate for their health and needs first. also almond milk lasagna (especially since she\u2019s vegetarian) makes her TA immediately. unironically that\u2019s the worst part", "You are NOT over reacting. You are betraying yourself for tolerating it.", "OP, she is not someone that is compatible to live in the same house as you if this is her diet. I am lactose intolerant so a lot of my 'dairy' products are coconut/almond based and I know I either wouldn't be able to share a house with you or would need to give up milky products/cheeses and honestly, for someone's health and safety it's not hard to make that choice. \n\nYour friend is actively harming you and choosing to do so. Please tell her that all those items are no longer allowed in your home as they are harming you and tell her she needs to decontaminate or replace the items she has made unsafe for you (heck if she's moving out she can buy you a new air fryer/over trays and keep the old ones etc)", "You need her out in 30days, but I'm JUNE", "Why? What if you lose your job from not being able to perform well? Or end up in hospital with huge bills? \n\nThis woman literally does not give a shit about your health. A friend does not do this. You\u2019re being far too passive and accepting of this."]}
