He would tell me I was lazy, being a baby and he had priorities.  The Dr even had my call my mom for my emergency surgery because he said my partner would not help properly.  He was right.   He was pissed he had to go wait at the pharmacy  because I was crying from surgery pain and needed meds. I was weak after the surgery even after the transfusions but I was lazy because i was asking for help. \n  I was in college, cared for the family, fixed the cars, but it was never enough.  He worked and felt he deserved to not have to watch the kids or help me when I was sick. It only got worse over time. It started to be come more abusive and I got the guts to leave.

Make it make sense. \n\nHe's an A for expecting these to automatically be YOUR job and stating you're lazy if you don't. Okay so what is he if he doesn't do those tasks?
