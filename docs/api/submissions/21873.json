Set up a meeting with your art teacher, you, and your mom to discuss what should be in your portfolio and clear up your mom's misconceptions. If you know what schools your want to apply to you can bring examples of their portfolio criteria and your current works so that you and the teacher can identify what peices you are still missing for your application.", "NTA - as a person who applied and got accepted to several Art schools (ended up not going due to financial reasons) you are exactly right. Diversification within the realm of your goals is what you want to do. Now if you want to eventually be a full time ceramics artist then yes of course you'd need some ceramics in your portfolio but from everything you said you are correct and your mom is wrong", "\"What she meant was stuff like literal pottery, ceramics, and other such stuff.\"\n\nInterpretive dance is an art too lol\n\nNTA.\n\nStick to your guns. You know what you are talking about, she doesnt. Its that simple.", "NAH The whole college entrance thing is stressful for everyone. Your mom is trying to help. You\u2019re trying to get it right.\n\nTell your mom to go to the websites of the schools you\u2019re trying to get into & check out their portfolios. That will get the two of you on the same page.", "I think you\u2019ve been extremely well controlled in your conversations with your mother. \n\nGet advice from someone who really knows what they are talking about. Thank your mother for all her input but say you now have someone who knows exactly what is needed and you\u2019ll be following their advice from now on. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Put it in perspective by telling her something like, \"You majored in US History, why didn't you diversify into the history of other nations?\" Then if she says she did (which is likely, as her track probably included a more cosmopolitan view of history with a specialization in the United States), ask her really specific questions about world history that she should know about U.S. History. Things like who was Prime Minister between Winston Churchill's two terms (since she could probably name the president between Grover Cleveland's two terms). When she can't answer, tell her \"see, you don't need to have that level of knowledge in *everything.*", "NTA it would be one thing if she went down a similar path as you and talking from experience, but she\u2019s essentially just blowing smoke up her ass.", "I graduated from an art university in 2014. Your mom is 100% right and knows more than you think.\n\nMy basic curriculum involved over 7 realism based drawing classes, a 3D design class, multiple design classes across multiple disciplines- print making and photography. You are exposed to it all and if you don't like the class or medium, and don't work hard and pass the class- that's a failing grade for you. You're not just going to jump into comics and never have to learn anything else. There were so many kids with your mindset, and none of them lasted more than a year.\n\nYou will only be getting into your major classes your sophomore or junior years. Having one style- only being interested in one aspect of art- not being open to the whole experience will be the death of you in a real art institute.\n\nSpecialize in your passion and what you are going to major in, you have your entire time in art school to work on it. You will have classes.\n\nFor the portfolio you need a little bit of everything. I got a $70,000 scholarship through my portfolio and I had everything from comics to storyboards to realistic drawing, life drawing, photography, ceramics.... and never lose your artistic spirit and sense of curiosity and experimentation and wonder. They will look right past your portfolio if you don't take it seriously.\n\nThere is a difference between a portfolio to get into art school, and the one you will have by the end that you will perfect all the years your there and will be specialized to your job. You are skipping steps and the adults in your life are trying to look out for you.\n\nYTA and I would apologize to your mom. Your mom and art teacher are both right, and you should be more open to advice from older people and not judge them based off how much you think they know. Good life lesson here for ya.\n\n-Advice from someone who graduated from a very prestigious art university and has real unbiased advice, unlike any comment I've actually read on this thread so far", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But start where your passion is, not hers.

Have a look at portfolios together, speak with your art teacher together, make her feel included.", "> So how do I get her to understand I know what I\u2019m talking about \n\nYou can't. So stop trying. If she tells you you need to do more things, say \"Okay, Mom\" and change the subject. In general, do your best to avoid discussing art or your portfolio with her.\n\nHowever, with that said - you may want to visit the various schools' websites to see what they want to see in portfolios. Make a list of all common features, and of course whatever is required for the schools you want most, and work through it systematically.\n\nNTA.", "I will not say NTA but ESH, because as an art student myself, a portfolio is there to show how creative you are. yes you must do illustration and comics because it's your speciality and you want to do this for your life, BUT, you have to also put other works that you already made even if it's not about illustration and comics (at the end of the portfolio in bonus !) because otherwise we couldn't tell how creative you really are if you focus on only one subject (which is illustration and comics). \n\nBut i can be wrong as I assume that you are from the US and it may not be the same procedure of doing, so feel free do to everything you want (if you can enter un contact with someone in your high school (search on twitter with the name of the school + illustration or comics) and ask them if they have done something in bonus for their portfolio) \n\n(I'm sorry if i don't have a good english :/)", "Thats interesting where i live you truly have to do pottery, sculpturing etc. And involve it into your portfolio. There are specific Things you HAVE to do and pottery is one of them..like you wont get taken automatically if that is missing. Maybe the mum Heard that from someone else as well but it doesnt apply to the school because i think OP wouldve informed themselves enough beforehand", "Maybe it would be necessary for someone applying for a general art program. I should\u2019ve made it clear I applied specifically for graphic design and illustration programs not general art programs."]}
