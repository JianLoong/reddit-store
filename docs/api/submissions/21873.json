Set up a meeting with your art teacher, you, and your mom to discuss what should be in your portfolio and clear up your mom's misconceptions. If you know what schools your want to apply to you can bring examples of their portfolio criteria and your current works so that you and the teacher can identify what peices you are still missing for your application.", "NTA - as a person who applied and got accepted to several Art schools (ended up not going due to financial reasons) you are exactly right. Diversification within the realm of your goals is what you want to do. Now if you want to eventually be a full time ceramics artist then yes of course you'd need some ceramics in your portfolio but from everything you said you are correct and your mom is wrong", "\"What she meant was stuff like literal pottery, ceramics, and other such stuff.\"\n\nInterpretive dance is an art too lol\n\nNTA.\n\nStick to your guns.

Thank your mother for all her input but say you now have someone who knows exactly what is needed and you\u2019ll be following their advice from now on. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Put it in perspective by telling her something like, \"You majored in US History, why didn't you diversify into the history of other nations?\" Then if she says she did (which is likely, as her track probably included a more cosmopolitan view of history with a specialization in the United States), ask her really specific questions about world history that she should know about U.S. History. Things like who was Prime Minister between Winston Churchill's two terms (since she could probably name the president between Grover Cleveland's two terms). When she can't answer, tell her \"see, you don't need to have that level of knowledge in *everything.*", "NTA it would be one thing if she went down a similar path as you and talking from experience, but she\u2019s essentially just blowing smoke up her ass.", "I graduated from an art university in 2014. Your mom is 100% right and knows more than you think.\n\nMy basic curriculum involved over 7 realism based drawing classes, a 3D design class, multiple design classes across multiple disciplines- print making and photography. You are exposed to it all and if you don't like the class or medium, and don't work hard and pass the class- that's a failing grade for you. You're not just going to jump into comics and never have to learn anything else. There were so many kids with your mindset, and none of them lasted more than a year.\n\nYou will only be getting into your major classes your sophomore or junior years. Having one style- only being interested in one aspect of art- not being open to the whole experience will be the death of you in a real art institute.\n\nSpecialize in your passion and what you are going to major in, you have your entire time in art school to work on it. You will have classes.\n\nFor the portfolio you need a little bit of everything. I got a $70,000 scholarship through my portfolio and I had everything from comics to storyboards to realistic drawing, life drawing, photography, ceramics.... and never lose your artistic spirit and sense of curiosity and experimentation and wonder. They will look right past your portfolio if you don't take it seriously.\n\nThere is a difference between a portfolio to get into art school, and the one you will have by the end that you will perfect all the years your there and will be specialized to your job. You are skipping steps and the adults in your life are trying to look out for you.\n\nYTA and I would apologize to your mom. Your mom and art teacher are both right, and you should be more open to advice from older people and not judge them based off how much you think they know. Good life lesson here for ya.\n\n-Advice from someone who graduated from a very prestigious art university and has real unbiased advice, unlike any comment I've actually read on this thread so far", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But start where your passion is, not hers.  You'll get to the stuff she thinks is important at some point, but you're not on a schedule, and the vast rubric that art emcompasses - \\[insert any adjective(s) that art has ever addressed\\] - youll never get to all of it.", "NAH.\n\nYou and your mum both want what\u2019s best for you. This is normally a pretty stressful time for both of you I\u2019m sure.\n\nShe\u2019s probably got a point about diversifying slightly just in case your first choice (illustration) doesn\u2019t work out and you want to opt for a more open course (like fine art).\n\nBut the best thing to do is work with her, not against her. Have a look at portfolios together, speak with your art teacher together, make her feel included.", "> So how do I get her to understand I know what I\u2019m talking about \n\nYou can't. So stop trying. If she tells you you need to do more things, say \"Okay, Mom\" and change the subject. In general, do your best to avoid discussing art or your portfolio with her.\n\nHowever, with that said - you may want to visit the various schools' websites to see what they want to see in portfolios. Make a list of all common features, and of course whatever is required for the schools you want most, and work through it systematically.\n\nNTA.", "I will not say NTA but ESH, because as an art student myself, a portfolio is there to show how creative you are. yes you must do illustration and comics because it's your speciality and you want to do this for your life, BUT, you have to also put other works that you already made even if it's not about illustration and comics (at the end of the portfolio in bonus !) because otherwise we couldn't tell how creative you really are if you focus on only one subject (which is illustration and comics). \n\nBut i can be wrong as I assume that you are from the US and it may not be the same procedure of doing, so feel free do to everything you want (if you can enter un contact with someone in your high school (search on twitter with the name of the school + illustration or comics) and ask them if they have done something in bonus for their portfolio) \n\n(I'm sorry if i don't have a good english :/)", "Thats interesting where i live you truly have to do pottery, sculpturing etc. And involve it into your portfolio. There are specific Things you HAVE to do and pottery is one of them..like you wont get taken automatically if that is missing. Maybe the mum Heard that from someone else as well but it doesnt apply to the school because i think OP wouldve informed themselves enough beforehand", "Maybe it would be necessary for someone applying for a general art program. I should\u2019ve made it clear I applied specifically for graphic design and illustration programs not general art programs.", "My son did a portfolio for art school. There were requirements to show several different things. His teacher made sure that he had completed all the areas before senior year as the portfolio needed to be sent out in the fall to apply for school admission. I believe he took pictures of all his art, and made a website so that it could be looked at by anyone. And then when he became a graphic designer, he had a website with all his examples of work on it.", "Info: what are you primarily drawing/painting right now? It wasn't uncommon at my high school for people who wanted to do comic art/illustration to only draw anime or comic art on the computer. When teachers tried to tell them to diversify and not just do computer art, they would have tantrums. Those people did not get into art schools. \n\nI know you said your mom mentioned ceramics and pottery, I just want to make sure your doing actual painted/varied work? Just stylised comics and digital art, unless they are mind blowingly skilled, will not look good for a portfolio.", "NTA, it\u2019s pretty clear your mom doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s talking about. I would see if you can set up a meeting with the teacher so it can be clarified to her what \u201cdiversifying\u201d actually means in this context.", "NAH. I see where you're coming from, and you're correct that your portfolio should be mostly geared to the programs you're applying too, but I also don't think your mom is necessarily wrong. Applying for university is stressful and a convoluted process, you both are trying your best to make sense of a very opaque system. \n\nI will say that I have a degree in graphic design from a competitive program, and I had to do portfolio interviews to get into that. I have also had to make portfolios for job interviews. Although ~90% of my portfolio is graphic design work, I do make a point to include a little bit of painting and sculpture because it shows that I have breadth as an artist \u2014 I care about art beyond this one form, and I care enough to do it for fun. Schools often like to see that breadth in art students because you will almost certainly be required to take some studios outside your major. In my experience, interviewers almost always comment on my sculpture work, because it's something they don't see every day.\n\nAre any of the programs you're planning to apply to local? Many of them will probably start having portfolio workshops at some point in the fall, and I would HIGHLY recommend going to those because they will tell you exactly what they specifically are looking for. Takes a lot of the guess work out!", "I agree, a meeting with OP's art teacher is the best way to clear up any misconceptions. Also, to check out the websites of whatever art schools they plan on applying to, they're usually going to be pretty clear on what they're looking for because they have no desire to waste their own time, never mind that of applicants. Having said that, it probably wouldn't do any harm to show a bit of interest in other arts, even if it's only for the personal statement and not the portfolio. The more well rounded a prospective student appears, the more they will stand out.", "For sure this \u261d\ufe0f\n\nPortfolio\u2019s to get in to a school needs to show that you are able to do more than one thing. Willing to learn more than one thing. And that you have not already pigeonholed yourself.", "That is wild to me, I majored in textile arts and I've never touched a pottery wheel in my life because *why would I, my chosen medium is fabric.*", "Tbf there is some neat dipped burlap stuff you can do with pottery since the fabric burns away in the kiln"]}
