I\u2019ve always had kind of an iffy relationship with my SIL because she\u2019s made it known for years that she wishes my husband married his college girlfriend and not me. Over the years we got to the point where I wouldn\u2019t call us super close but we were friendly enough to text and would hang out solo when one of us visited the other.\n\nLast year my FIL got very sick and needed specialized care. My husband wanted him to live with us during his treatment and during recovery and I agreed. SIL made it clear she did NOT want him at her house. I was able to go part time at work during this time and so by nature I became the primary caregiver. It wasn\u2019t fun but I did care for my FIL and was happy that he and my husband had time together.\n\nOn the other hand my inlaws, especially my SIL became a problem. My BIL and SIL were very much in denial when it came to his health. When my FIL had appointments I would keep everyone informed (mostly via a text chain because it was easier) and mostly stayed out of decision making because he\u2019s not my father and I wanted to respect that. SIL / BIL started treating me like hired help. Example: When FIL needed to go to a skilled rehab facility after a stay in the hospital I ran around touring facilities and spent hours on the phone and when I let everyone know my findings my SIL said \u201cwill discuss as a family and get back to you.\u201d Excuse me? I guess I\u2019m not family. Instances like this happened more and more and neither BIL or SIL made any effort to come see their dying father. When I would occasionally express my feelings to SIL said \u201cthis doesn\u2019t concern you, go get your nails done or something.\u201d\n\nEventually my FIL passed away and I cut off all contact with my in laws. There was no blow out, I just stopped responding to the group chat and stopped actively trying to be in their lives and made my husband start shopping for birthday gifts, etc for them and told him to leave my name off the cards. My husband wasn\u2019t thrilled about the rift but understood where I was coming from and I told him many, many times that he can have whatever relationship he wants with them, just leave me out of it. \n\nA few weeks ago my SIL sent me a text apologizing for everything because she was in denial about my FIL and she hopes I\u2019m doing fabulous. I sent her a message back acknowledging her apology and thanking her for the time and effort she put into reflecting on the situation but didn\u2019t initiate further conversation. \n\nMy SIL now wants to come to visit and stay with us for a few days. I told my husband she\u2019s welcome to stay but I will be going to see my best friend during that time. My husband was taken aback and said he understands but it really upsets him that I want nothing to do with her and it\u2019s not realistic for me to avoid her forever. I really do not want anything to do with people who don\u2019t consider me family.\n\nSo, am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1697982204, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17dtll5/aita_for_going_on_vacation_when_my_in_laws_visit/", "score": 5851, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's smart of you to leave for her visit.  But also have a conversation with your husband about not making ANY commitments to his sister without discussing it with you first; he shouldn't agree to house SIL for an extended length of time, give/lend her money, cosign for any purchases, donate an organ, take in a child, or anything along those lines without you and he having some serious conversations.  In fact, if his sister asks for anything at all, his response should be that you and he will discuss it and he'll get back to her in a couple weeks with an answer.", "NTA.

So SIL comes to visit and makes comments or makes you uncomfortable, how is your husband going to have your back when he hasn't before? Better to not be there than to realize your husband is fully spineless.", "NTA, also it sounds like your husband really dropped the ball on having your back during the time when your FIL was staying with you.

Husband does not get to sit back now after 23 years and call you out for finally standing up for yourself.

You should also let him know that her apology is fake since she immediately wants something from you. \n\nI just want to add that I wouldn\u2019t let her into your home.

By your own admission you said you took yourself out of the decision making because you didn\u2019t feel that was your right. Perhaps that was conveyed in someway to them, either by word or action? SIL/BIL were total AH no doubt but I feel like there is some background noise we are missing. Grief is a powerful thing and makes people behave differently. I do believe your husband should have reigned them in but that is now neither here nor there. My point here is as caregivers we have a tendency to sort out what we can and can\u2019t handle. We can handle our LOs and their care. We cannot handle what we consider unnecessary drama and all that goes with it so we shut it out. She is your husband\u2019s sister. She was the unnecessary drama so you are shutting her out but she is important to your husband and, it sounds like his only sibling and close family. You owe it to yourself to finally say what you\u2019ve shut out, if only for your peace of mind. She said her piece, why not you?

Yes he is your father in law and you were caring for him and probably loved him but kids are different. So I get that comment. \n\nTelling you that things dont concern you and to go get your nails done is the same thing but with a nasty twist. Some people do not handle death and dying well.

Maybe if she\u2019s sincere you can work back to a civil relationship but that certainly does not mean you should be okay with her coming to stay with you and all that entails for you for several days. She honestly sounds like a shit person though, starting with her giving her opinion TO YOU that she thought her bro should\u2019ve married someone else. Who does that? You should make a concise list as a reminder to him of what she\u2019s actually said and done to you over the years and then either mail it to him or text it to him while you\u2019re gone.

They got the message and wanted back in our lives which we allowed slowly all went well for a while but slowly they went back to their ways.

Well done for your efforts and labor in this regard. \n\nI am a huge believer in putting things in the past, forgiving past transgressions and moving on. But I'm not sure SIL 's apology is enough to square things. There will need to be a period for her to prove that she really has seen that she behaved badly and makes it up to you. Like by including you in \"family\" activities and decisions. I think that you are fine going away when she visits. A few days would feel like an eternity if she reverts to type. Maybe give her a chance with some shorter connections first and see how that goes.

She apologized. While it might not be sufficient, it's a start. You can't expect them to make things right unless you sit down with them and tell them how you feel and work through it. \n\nIt sounds like you're letting bitterness from decades ago control you know.

It's the nails comment for me. Holy smokes, I'm sorry you had to go through that. I went NC with my in-laws who were cruel to me. I have no regrets. Best of luck.", "Adding on, I would totally reject her request to stay. No. Nobody gets to kick me out of my home. Its home! Your home! No, your husband can pay for her hotel room for one night, but she wouldn't be allowed to step foot in MY home.", "NTA \n\nI have had a similar experience within my family and I\u2019ve come to realize that some people are just selfish and don\u2019t see the importance of being there for a loved one in their time of need. But when the roles are reversed they are the first ones to call out anybody they feel are not providing them the help and attention they need. \n\nI don\u2019t think she was in denial at all, but rather decided she didn\u2019t need to do anything because you were there to do it. She likely didn\u2019t care enough to sacrifice her time and comfort to help because she just didn\u2019t want to.

If you want to see her you'll have to reach out to her and plan something.\"\n\nNo one ever does and if they did I'd just be busy. If they pointed it out, I'd play dumb.

She should not have to be uncomfortable in her own home. \n\nHe should have never entertained her staying. It sounds like he said yes to SIL without making sure his wife was okay with the arrangements.", "Yeah, and he should have shut that shit down with his sister treating OP like crap from the get go. NTA", "I second this!", "What HE put her through. He was involved in the \u2018family only chats\u2019 instead of standing by his wife. He was complicit. He should be grateful that\u2019s the only consequence for his behaviour", "Yeah, if I were OP, I'd be tempted to respond \"New phone, who did?\" or leave her on read for a few days, then text \"Oops, Saaawwwwwreeeee I didn't answer sooner, I was getting my nails done\"", "Thank you. I do want to make it clear that it was my choice to go part time because I could and it made the most sense benefits wise. If I had said no, we probably would have not had him here or hired help or something like that. My hand was not forced. Heck, it could have even been my idea for all I remember (I seriously don\u2019t.) \n\nI did it because I viewed the marriage as a partnership. There were times when he supported me during grad school and I did the same when he changed careers about 10 years ago. I viewed it as another we have each others backs situation.", "I agree with this 100%! SIL should be banned from ever being welcome in that home again.. cuz..\"not family\" and all.\n\nIf that were my husband, he'd be staying at the aribnb with his stupid sister during her visit and I'd have the house to myself. Lol", "Me too TBH", "OP told her husband that he can continue to have a relationship with her. OP is doing what is necessary for her own piece of mind. OP doesn't need to have a conversation with SIL at all. SIL treated someone badly. She got consequences. If she didn't want consequences, she shouldn't have acted badly. Grief isn't an excuse to treat others badly. Sometimes, silence speaks volumes, and says everything someone needs to say. Her not giving more time out of her life to someone who was bad to her doesn't make her TA in the least bit. If people are telling her to go crawling back to SIL 'because family', they're enablers.", "I respectfully disagree. You're essentially enabling SIL and saying that if someone apologizes,  op is forced to accept it, and forced to be happy to be around people that have treated op badly. That's not how life works. SIL acknowledged her wrongdoing. That's something she should have done in the first place. That makes her entitled to wrongdoing. If someone treated me like how SIL treated op, that loser would be out of my life. SIL should feel content with getting a response. SIL saying that she wants to come stay for a few days shows the real intent behind the 'apology'.", "I completely see what you are saying and I do understand. My issue is that I felt like a complete idiot for putting in effort with her for 20+ years and I sincerely feel like a text saying \u201csorry for everything\u201d does not cut it and I really do not know how to come back from it.", "I have to disagree here because OP wasn\u2019t just \u201cpresent and helpful,\u201d she was the primary caregiver. I think I\u2019d agree if SIL or BIL or even OP\u2019s husband had taken on that role. But OP stepped up to take care of the father and should be treated with respect for that", "She\u2019s mentioned to your husband she wants to stay he\u2019s told her you\u2019re upset so she\u2019s apologised\u2026 and yes you absolutely can avoid her forever", "Why are you so certain? I agree she\u2019s treated you like crap but people can change. Isn\u2019t it better to accept the olive branch and give her a chance?", "I wouldn\u2019t trust her in my home. Why do you need to leave? Tell your husband that the apology was insincere, she needs to stay in a hotel.", "She would not be welcome in my home.   \nIn fact, I have ONE SIL (no BILs) and she is not welcome in my home. I don\u2019t go to hers, either. My beloved MIL & FIL live near them, and I ignore her when we\u2019re all there at the same time. No drama. I just don\u2019t put any mental effort into her, in any way. She\u2019s dead to me and has been for about 10 years. \n\nI\u2019m a grown-ass woman and I get to choose who to spend my time with.   \n\n\nNTA!", "Tell her an apology doesn't come even close to making up for the weeks and months you spent caring for your FIL with no help and no support from them.", "If SIL loved her brother, she would treat *his wife, the woman who took care of their dying father,* with respect.", "Depending on MIL\u2019s condition and if it was terminal, that death could\u2019ve been a blessing.

At least, if they are good people.\n\nThey should be falling over themselves shouting their appreciation for you caring for THEIR dying father. For sacrificing your work and hours, days, months of your life for him. Even if you did it willingly, you took that off their plates. You were basically an angel to them.\n\nAnd they treated you like shit. Stay the course, sister. They do not deserve you.", "Flowers? Gifts? Reimbursement for time and energy spent? A well thought out letter acknowledging OP went above and beyond to ensure FIL got to live out his last days loved, respected, and cared for and that she didn\u2019t deserve the abhorrent way they treated her, and they\u2019re truly grateful for the grace with which she handled things?", "Your husband should have had your back when the initial issues with sil was happening - at least to the extent of saying to his sister that you are his wife and she needs to treat you with respect. The \u201cget your nails done\u201d comment should have made him cut off contact with his sister. You have more of a husband problem than a sil problem. Hope he appreciates you otherwise.", "You're much nicer of a person than I am. After repeated bad behavior towards op, I see SIL deserving nothing. If SIL wants to be reflective, that's fine. However, if you notice, the SIL immediately after the 'apology' that she wants to come stay over for a few days. It sounds like she needs a place to crash, and said whatever was necessary to make that happen.", "In my opinion the best solution would be to receive your SIL as a guest and use that as a genuine opportunity to make peace, openly showing your vulnerability so that you two can build empathy and trust. \n\nYou choosing to go somewhere else will only create further separation between you and you husband\u2019s family. Your goal was to help, not to harm. Your goal is still not to create further damage - don\u2019t allow the actions of another to derail you from your truth.\n\nDoing that could create a void between your SIL and your husband, between your potential children and your potential nephews, and in short\u2026 between your nuclear family and your husband\u2019s family/extended family.\n\nReddit seems very cynical about it, but family relationships are complex and collective healing sometimes takes efforts from all parts.", "To visit her brother?", "Why should you remind him for his own sister ? If he doesn\u2019t care , why should you? Just because you are female, doesn\u2019t mean you need to watch out for stuff like this. He grew up with her as a sibling and if he can\u2019t be bothered to remember her , then it says something. She is not worth remembering", "Yeah, not a lame apology by text.", "I interpreted it as she recognized that OP was not engaging with her apology over text and realized that she needed to address it in person.", "This sounds more like she wanted to get out of caring for an ailing parent than denial of his condition. She got out of everything hard and now can stay at your house after a fake apology and your husband says you can\u2019t avoid her forever ? You can say \u201cwatch me \u201c.", "So she might be using you and husband for free lodging while she comes for a reunion  or visiting friends.", "Lol. Oh sweet summer child", "Tell him to deadass look at her and reply, \u201cshe went on holiday with her friend as she assumed you only wanted to spend time with family.\u201d", "He avoids uncomfortable situations pushing you under the bus.   \nLike, when your FIL (his father) was still alive and you took care of him, your husband left you alone to talk with SIL and BIL, letting them to insult you and treat you like some hired maid.   \nIt should be him, who communicated all the thing to his siblings - this way they wouldn't have the \"family only\" plea and he should say to them, that as they didn't participate in any of work, they have no saying in decisions making.", "You can solve it for him then. \n\n\"While I appreciate your apology it does not undo the way you constantly belittled me while I was essentially the sole caregiver for your dying father. You made it clear you don't consider me family. Since my husband is your brother I do not want to interfere with your family time and will be vacationing while you visit him\"", "Hahah yeah, why lift a finger for emotional labor to advocate for your wife who sacrificed her time, career, etc for your dying father, who graciously accepted mistreatment from his sister. Your husband is failing you.", "Sheesh, you deserve a partner who wants people to treat you with respect and will do everything in his power to ensure that! Leave for her visit, tell him it\u2019s a growth opportunity and that you\u2019ve done your part, now it\u2019s on him. \n\nMaybe leave a day early and ask your husband to take that time to work through why it\u2019s more important to him to avoid conflict than it is for you to be treated with respect. And then think about why he\u2019s willing to engage with people who don\u2019t respect the one person he\u2019s chosen to spend his life with. And then after that he can dive into exactly what he\u2019s gonna say to his sister. Something along the lines of \u201cI should have said this a long time ago. Your behavior towards my wife has been unacceptable. She has turned the other cheek and did it while caring for our dying father and supporting me through his illness and death. She showed up when you wouldn\u2019t. If you have a any issues with how that makes you feel, figure it out on your own time. I hope we don\u2019t have to have this conversation again. Because if we do, it\u2019ll end with \u201cI\u2019m sorry but we do not have room in our lives for people who treat us like this.\u201d\u201d.", "You are NTA, your SIL obviously is, but your husband is too, sorry. Someone who rather lets his wife be treated this way than experiences uncomfortable feelings is an AH.\n\nI would say absolutely not to SIL visiting my home, whether I'm there or not, but you do you. Leaving is a really good idea too. At least DO NOT host her.", "Tell her the hotel is down the road. I wouldn\u2019t want her in my home. I wouldn\u2019t even trust your DH to watch her.", "I get the feeling he dropped the ball supporting you while his father was alive. NTA and enjoy your vacation", "OP to Husband - Just tell your sister that I don't spend time with people who aren't family, and she is not my family. \n\nHere, I solved his problem of what he can tell his sister.", "He should grow a spine and tell his sister why. In fact , he should be very vocal about his support for you and everything you sacrificed for his family. He can get over his small discomfort.", "All he has to say is, \"I told her I wanted to take some time and hang out with family so she should go see friends or something. She had a lady's trip she wanted to plan anyway so it was good timing. Gives us more family time, just the three of us.\"", "You\u2019re spending time\u2026with family. Duh! :)", "Heh, I used to be the good wife and keep in touch with my husband's relatives, buy them presents, etc. Then time passed and I had more responsibilities and was also tired of it, so I stopped. He never stepped up and now he wonders why his relatives aren't in touch any more.", "Do you REALLY think that OP needs to specify to the in-laws that she needs a more heartfelt apology than just a text for years of abuse?", "Even if she recognized that, it doesn't make her entitled to do so. However, the 'apology' coming at the same time she requests to stay over for a few days makes it extremely suspect.", "NTA.

Here are the facts of the situation:\n\n-SIL wanted Op\u2019s husband to marry someone else, and only reached the point of being civil with Op before FIL got sick.\n\n-Op took care of FIL while he was sick and did the majority of the work.\n\n-During that time, SIL treated Op horribly and told her repeatedly that she wasn\u2019t family. \n\n-FIL dies and Op steps away from her husband\u2019s family. No one reached out to her during that time or asks husband about it.\n\n-A few weeks ago, SIL apologized via text which is the easiest method of apology. Op thanks her, and SIL makes no further effort in making their relationship better.\n\n-SIL now wants to stay at their house without any mention of composition and/or double checking whether Op would feel comfortable in her presence.\n\nYou can call my outlook bitter if you want. I only look at the facts before making my conclusion. If SIL really wanted to improve the relationship, she would put in more effort by talking to Op and proving that SIL changed (if Op feels comfortable with that). She would get her own hotel and ensure Op felt comfortable before visiting. Right now, it looks like SIL wants something from Op.", "Is he any good? You don't talk about your husband much. Does he keep his family off your back? Did he intervene when they treated you like hired help?", "Even with a wonderful husband, it is still an ongoing project.", "Maybe it\u2019s your husband, who experienced the incredible sacrifice of his wife going part time to be his father\u2019s caretaker in his last days, and acts like the abuse you received from his sister is not worthy of his time to advocate for you.

What do you get out of it? If you don't normally go and take a bunch of pictures on an outing like that then to do it just so you can imagine some spite in your head seems...... Unhealthy. Just go, have fun and don't think about SIL. Anything else is her winning with no benefit to yourself.", "I like the way you think. I'm this level of petty also. Most things would be locked away. Husband would have to be happy host.", ">Refrigerator should not be stocked up and guest room not prepared. His sister, his responsibility for all aspects of her visit.\n\nI disagree. I think it would be better to prepare for a guest as usual, but like... a normal guest. Don't bother preparing anything specifically for her, just clean linens and normal groceries.

Not day long stay overs.", "I wouldn't even give her the chance, honestly. The timing sounds way too convenient.

We have some family drama playing out and when it's over I'm going to send her a text.", "Agreed - OP, as much as you have a SIL problem, you have a massive husband problem.\n\nYou were kind enough to be the primary care taker for someone very ill and handle the logistics of all of his care and finding appropriate specialty care for him. Having been there, your SIL and BIL should have been bending over backwards towards you for taking that on. Not treating you poorly.\n\nNow she wants to visit? Go spend time with people you care about. No, you can not avoid her forever, but your first interactions with her should not be with her as a guest in your home. And if you do decide to stay, this is YOUR home and you have every right to stand up firmly for yourself.  She's rude? Tell her that we do not treat people like that in your home and if she can not be civil she can leave.\n\nYou need to put your foot down on what you will tolerate.", "Definitely what my BFF and I call a \"Carrots vs. Ice Cream\" decision.", "Well, good then.\n\nThen she can stay at a hotel and still be sorry.

That out of the fog of fear and grief she sees how much she owes you and how much you did that she should be grateful for, and wants to address it.
