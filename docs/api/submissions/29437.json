I\u2019ve always had kind of an iffy relationship with my SIL because she\u2019s made it known for years that she wishes my husband married his college girlfriend and not me. Over the years we got to the point where I wouldn\u2019t call us super close but we were friendly enough to text and would hang out solo when one of us visited the other.\n\nLast year my FIL got very sick and needed specialized care. My husband wanted him to live with us during his treatment and during recovery and I agreed. SIL made it clear she did NOT want him at her house. I was able to go part time at work during this time and so by nature I became the primary caregiver. It wasn\u2019t fun but I did care for my FIL and was happy that he and my husband had time together.\n\nOn the other hand my inlaws, especially my SIL became a problem. My BIL and SIL were very much in denial when it came to his health. When my FIL had appointments I would keep everyone informed (mostly via a text chain because it was easier) and mostly stayed out of decision making because he\u2019s not my father and I wanted to respect that. SIL / BIL started treating me like hired help. Example: When FIL needed to go to a skilled rehab facility after a stay in the hospital I ran around touring facilities and spent hours on the phone and when I let everyone know my findings my SIL said \u201cwill discuss as a family and get back to you.\u201d Excuse me? I guess I\u2019m not family. Instances like this happened more and more and neither BIL or SIL made any effort to come see their dying father. When I would occasionally express my feelings to SIL said \u201cthis doesn\u2019t concern you, go get your nails done or something.\u201d\n\nEventually my FIL passed away and I cut off all contact with my in laws. There was no blow out, I just stopped responding to the group chat and stopped actively trying to be in their lives and made my husband start shopping for birthday gifts, etc for them and told him to leave my name off the cards. My husband wasn\u2019t thrilled about the rift but understood where I was coming from and I told him many, many times that he can have whatever relationship he wants with them, just leave me out of it. \n\nA few weeks ago my SIL sent me a text apologizing for everything because she was in denial about my FIL and she hopes I\u2019m doing fabulous. I sent her a message back acknowledging her apology and thanking her for the time and effort she put into reflecting on the situation but didn\u2019t initiate further conversation. \n\nMy SIL now wants to come to visit and stay with us for a few days. I told my husband she\u2019s welcome to stay but I will be going to see my best friend during that time. My husband was taken aback and said he understands but it really upsets him that I want nothing to do with her and it\u2019s not realistic for me to avoid her forever. I really do not want anything to do with people who don\u2019t consider me family.\n\nSo, am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1697982204, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17dtll5/aita_for_going_on_vacation_when_my_in_laws_visit/", "score": 1826, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's smart of you to leave for her visit.  But also have a conversation with your husband about not making ANY commitments to his sister without discussing it with you first; he shouldn't agree to house SIL for an extended length of time, give/lend her money, cosign for any purchases, donate an organ, take in a child, or anything along those lines without you and he having some serious conversations.  In fact, if his sister asks for anything at all, his response should be that you and he will discuss it and he'll get back to her in a couple weeks with an answer.", "NTA. It\u2019s great she is coming around and reflecting on the past and trying to mend the relationship but you don\u2019t have to mend it on her terms just cause she is ready.

So SIL comes to visit and makes comments or makes you uncomfortable, how is your husband going to have your back when he hasn't before? Better to not be there than to realize your husband is fully spineless.", "NTA, also it sounds like your husband really dropped the ball on having your back during the time when your FIL was staying with you.

He should have responded to SIL in those group texts, \u201cif you have a problem, then you come handle everything\u201d, or from day one when you both got together.  Husband does not get to sit back now after 23 years and call you out for finally standing up for yourself.

You should also let him know that her apology is fake since she immediately wants something from you. \n\nI just want to add that I wouldn\u2019t let her into your home.

By your own admission you said you took yourself out of the decision making because you didn\u2019t feel that was your right. Perhaps that was conveyed in someway to them, either by word or action? SIL/BIL were total AH no doubt but I feel like there is some background noise we are missing. Grief is a powerful thing and makes people behave differently. I do believe your husband should have reigned them in but that is now neither here nor there. My point here is as caregivers we have a tendency to sort out what we can and can\u2019t handle. We can handle our LOs and their care. We cannot handle what we consider unnecessary drama and all that goes with it so we shut it out. She is your husband\u2019s sister. She was the unnecessary drama so you are shutting her out but she is important to your husband and, it sounds like his only sibling and close family. You owe it to yourself to finally say what you\u2019ve shut out, if only for your peace of mind. She said her piece, why not you?

Yes he is your father in law and you were caring for him and probably loved him but kids are different. So I get that comment. \n\nTelling you that things dont concern you and to go get your nails done is the same thing but with a nasty twist. Some people do not handle death and dying well. This may have been the situation with them. But the way she handled it is a super AH move. \n\nI dont blame you for your reaction and your feelings. You stepped up and got stepped on because of it.

Instead of calling you or arranging a face to face meeting to admit fault with her previous behavior, she offered a weak apology in the easiest way possible for her and seems to be hoping that will smooth everything over so she can have free lodging.
