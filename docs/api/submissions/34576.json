My mom and dad have very high-paying jobs at a really big company. My parents have always said that they want me to have a good life and to them that means that they want me to have lots of money.\n\nMy parents aren\u2019t very present in my life. They\u2019re always at work or out at a dinner party for their work, etc. I\u2019m home alone pretty much all the time, or with my best friend Alex. Alex has a smaller house and really nice parents so I hang out there a lot. Once I was at Alex\u2019s house for a whole week before my parents noticed I was gone.\n\nSo, every year I ask my parents for the same thing for my birthday: to spend one afternoon together. But, instead, I always get a text saying they have to stay at work late and I can go pick myself out a present.\n\nMy 17th birthday was last week and I asked my mom and dad if we could go to an arcade and the movies to see a movie I really wanted to see. All the days leading up to my birthday, my parents said that was fine. They were going to meet me at the arcade at 5:30 when they got out of work.\n\nI was waiting in my car at the arcade until 7:00 waiting for them to get there. I drove home and waited in the living room for them to get home. They walked in the door at 8:45 and barely acknowledged me. They walked past the living room, into the kitchen and poured themselves glasses of wine. I followed them into the kitchen and looked at them, standing there and talking to each other.\n\nI cleared my throat and my parents looked at me. My dad mumbled an apology and said they had gotten caught up at work. He tossed me a small box with car keys inside. He told me I could have his old car, because he just bought a new one. He smiled and gave me a half-hug. I said thanks and my mom asked if something was wrong.\n\nI told them that they left me hanging on my birthday again and my dad groaned and said to man up. He said that birthday parties are stupid, and I should be thankful that I got a nice car. I told him I\u2019m super grateful for the car but I just wanted to hang out with him and my mom. My mom said that she couldn\u2019t believe what an ungrateful boy she raised. Before I knew what was happening I was crying.\n\nI told them that all I\u2019ve ever wanted for my birthday is to have a normal day with them but they never did that. I cried even more and went to my room. I told Alex about what happened and he was pissed. He said I\u2019m so out of touch and a bitch for crying when I got my own car. I explained that I wasn\u2019t upset about the car but he said I\u2019m an entitled asshole.\n\nI really want to know if I am being out of touch and annoying about this, so any feedback is appreciated.

I'd also ask if work is that important to them, that they'd rather shove dollar bills at their kid in an attempt to make you stop complaining about their neglect. The reason why I'd want it in writing is so you have something to show them if they ever ask why you didn't express those feelings sooner - say, once you move out and go NC. They'll likely forget all the pain they caused you when they're retired and they want YOUR time and attention.

How each of you feel love? In one case, a present could mean a lot to one person but a hug would mean way more to another one. \n\nFor example, my love language is touching and having deep conversations. My wife\u2019s love language is service (she feels loves when others do things for her and she shows love towards us by doing things). I don\u2019t care as much about service and she doesn\u2019t care much about touching. Once we know that, we adapt. I make an effort to serve her in a what she will feel appreciated and she makes an effort to touch me and stop for a coffee and talk. \n\nhttps://5lovelanguages.com/\n\nWhy not sit together around the coffee table and each of you take the quiz and talk about it.? I\u2019m certain that you\u2019ll find that your love language is different from them.

I always say I love weekends and holidays simply because I get to spend time with my kids and I\u2019d be honoured if all my child wanted was to spend time with me for their birthday. You deserve better parents. NTA", "Oh honey. No. You are NTA\n\nFirst and foremost, Alex is being the AH here. I get being resentful when someone has financial stability and plenty you don't, but things cannot replace a parent's love and affection. Tell him that. Tell him that you love him, and you get he's frustrated, but ask him if he'd give up his parents' love and attention, every day, for the rest of his life, in exchange for all the things you get. Let him think about that. How he responds will tell you how good a friend he truly is.\n\nNow.\n\nAs a parent myself, your parents should be ashamed of themselves. First for neglecting you, second for constantly making promises they don't keep, third for thinking throwing you car keys can somehow make up for skipping out on you for seventeen years' worth of birthdays, and MOST for the \"man up\" comment. There is NOTHING wrong with showing your emotions and crying when you need to. As for your mother's comments that you are selfish- it is NEVER selfish to want your parents to love you and treat you better than they are. Frankly I would ask her to explain that to you- how is it selfish to want parents who give a damn enough to do more than the bare minimum and actually want to spend time with you?\n\nAs painful as it is to hear, though... they will likely never change. People like this rarely do. So seek out some counseling if you can (start with your school guidance counselor to ask for resources), and start getting those ducks in a row. I don't know what your future plans are, but I recommend setting yourself up to be as independent as possible. You'll be eighteen in a year, and once you are, you can set out into the world and make your own family. \n\nGood luck, sweetheart, and hugs from this internet Mama!", "It\u2019s your party, you can cry if you want to.", "Oh hon.

It's also not fair to ask a 17 year old boy to do the work of repairing the family his parents have broken.", "Why would you assume that his whole family would find time to sit around taking quizzes together?
