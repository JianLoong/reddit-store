We don't have any children together, but we both have kids from previous relationships.  I have 2 sons (18 & 15).  My wife has 3 daughters (27, 25 & 23).  None of our kids live with us full-time, but I have my sons 3 weekends a month and they stay with us a lot during the summer after school is out.\n\nMy 18-year old is going to college in the fall so I wanted to do something special before he goes off to adulthood.  My wife and I decided to do a family vacation with all of our kids, something we have never done before.  Obviously, since my sons are in high school, they don't have the money to pay for themselves so I will be paying for them.  My 18-year old wants to bring his GF, so I'm paying for half of her trip too, her parents are paying the other half.\n\nWhen we talked to my stepdaughters about the trip, we told them that they would have to pay their own way if they want to join us.  All 3 of them work full-time and the older 2 have long-term partners they want to bring with as well.  Simply put, we can't afford to pay for all of them and since they are older and earn their own money, it makes sense they will pay their own way.\n\nThey were fine with that at first, even though there were a few complaints about the destination, but you can't make everyone happy.  But then the oldest found out we are paying for my son's trips and half of the GF's, but not helping my stepdaughters at all.\n\nThe 3 of them ganged up on me during this past weekend while they were at our house.  They said that since we are paying for my sons, the fair thing would be to pay for them too, including half of the partners' trips.  I explained the difference in the circumstances regarding the ages of my sons and the fact that all 3 of my stepdaughters work full-time and earn their own money.  But that fell on deaf ears and they said that if we don't pay for them too, none of them are coming.\n\nThat's how the conversation ended and now my wife is frantically trying to figure out how to make this work and keep everyone happy.  But we simply can't afford to pay for EVERYONE, especially working adults.\n\nI'm tempted to just cancel the trip and take my boys on a smaller trip, just us.  But my wife hates that idea because she has her mind set on our first family vacation, all or nothing.  So I told my wife that if her girls aren't willing to pay for themselves, then we have 2 options.  Cancel the trip completely, or go without them.  I'm not willing to negotiate with them on this because we can't afford to pay for them, it's that simple.\n\nMy wife thinks we should find ways to pay for her daughters now, too.  But financially, that's just not possible.  I now feel like the trip is being held hostage by my stepdaughters.  I understand it might not seem fair to them, but my boys are in high school, not adults working full-time jobs.", "created_utc": 1685648062, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13xr0c6/aita_for_paying_for_my_biological_sons_to_come_on/", "score": 79, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are still financially responsible for your sons and would need to pay for them.

If you can't afford to pay for the daughters then shouldn't pay for his gf either. That point is what I think the daughters are taking issue with. If it was JUST the boys then you may not have got the same response.  Half for the girlfriend and then telling the daughters you had none for them .. if this is a family thing then maybe that half you were giving should be split into 3 and given to the daughters.

Well, not a cabin, a beach house.", "Yea, I don't think that the OP's situation is leading down the path toward fun though ;)\n\nMy mom keeps talking about renting a cabin in Michigan and well, if she ever gets around to it and invites us to come, I will pay our fair share. It's just been 30 years of my adulthood without her getting around to it so far though ...", "I never said the daughters deserve the money. I said I can understand why they\u2019re upset that they have to pay the full cost of the trip while a non family member only has to pay half.", "This is the way.", "Accept, I bet their mother is piling on the guilt because she wants that imaginary perfect family holiday. Don't underestimate the ability of a mother to manipulate her grown daughters with guilt!", "I mean, tbh the suggestion is less *I think this is what you should so* than it is *offer them something that is in practical terms a serious concession and see if they call your bluff* because I bet they will still reject it. But in either case I figure it basically would amount to \"hey, Johnny pitch in $50\" which... if I was 18 I'd be fine with that for a nice vacation.", "> OP is saying he shouldn\u2019t help his stepdaughters pay their portion because they\u2019re working adults\n\nHe said he can't afford to help them pay for the trip. Also it's not the same thing. The gf is one person. The step daughters want him to help cover 5 whole adults.", "Wow, ignoring the misogyny there for a quick minute. He said it's not financially possible to pay for all three daughters and then half for their two extra partners. He didn't say he couldn't pay part towards his step daughters.\n\nFor example the cost to take one person could be \u00a31000. OP cannot afford to spend \u00a34000 on his step daughters and their partners. However he might be able to give each daughter 1/4 of the cost and spend \u00a3750.", ">It\u2019s almost like women don\u2019t listen when men talk\n\nThis right here. This is what makes it misogynistic.\nRead that part again.\nThen re-read it.\nThat's misogyny.", "Wow that's sexist. And *actually* if he didn't pay for Half of the GF's trip, he WOULD be able to give at least SOME to his actual daughters.", "Are your step kids well off? Do you know for a fact that this trip won\u2019t place a financial burden on them? That might be what all this is about. They might be upset that you\u2019re happy to help a non family member but you didn\u2019t even ask if they need help paying for this trip.", "If they are paying for the son's they should pay for all kids. I think it shows facritsim to his sons over his step kids. Especially wit paying some portion to the girlfriend. I can totally understand why they are upset over it. They could have found a cheaper vacation so Noone is left out.", "I was thinking the same lol", "Have to agree with that. The gf\u2019s parents should be paying the full cost for her, and she\u2019s not family anyway.", ">while a non family member only has to pay half.\n\nWhile a teenager has to pay half.  Fixed that for you.", "Do you really think they would be satisfied with that though? They're demanding he fully cover them.", "And I love it how you get mad at a supposed demeaning comment then make a demeaning comment hypocrite much", "I always get this kinda shit lol how is it misogyny, You challenge a women on anything it\u2019s immediately called misogyny", "I don\u2019t really understand how that\u2019s sexist if the reverse was said that would never be called sexist yet when someone says it about women it\u2019s sexist \n\n\u201cWow men never listen to anything\u201d is not considered sexist yets it\u2019s literally the same comment women don\u2019t like being challenged on anything", "They had no issue covering themselves until they found out everyone else was covered.", "No, f that! The daughters are adults with full time jobs. The boys are kids in freaking HIGH SCHOOL! It's not showing favoritism, it's common sense that the boys can't pay. They are CHILDREN!", "The sons are children. The daughters are grown, working adults.", "Sons are minors?", "Is this how you communicate with your wife as well?", "She\u2019s a teenager who has parents that are responsible for taking care of her needs and wants and those parents are not you and your wife. I read in another comment that her parents aren\u2019t well off  so you wanted to help them out so the gf could go. I think that\u2019s very nice and I\u2019m not trashing you for it. I\u2019m saying that I can understand why your stepdaughters are annoyed with you because you\u2019re helping someone else\u2019s child without even offering to help them out with the cost of this trip.", "It's misogyny because you literally said 'women don't listen' It's really not that complicated. But we get it, you're sexist and don't like to admit it", "I mean, I'm going to assume you're a man and you're not listening.  That doesn't make anything sexist.  It just makes you an AH.  Leave.", "That\u2019s why I think this isn\u2019t about money. It\u2019s about hurt feelings. Just because they were willing to pay doesn\u2019t mean it wouldn\u2019t have been a financial burden on them. If OP didn\u2019t even ask if they needed help I can see why they would be hurt to learn he was paying for half of the gf\u2019s portion.", "Sometimes, when she asks me to fix something for her, I will tell her I fixed that for you.", "If my stepdaughters are annoyed because I'm helping a high schooler instead of helping them as grown adults, then I feel that says more about them than it does about me.", "If the same comment were made towards men it wouldn\u2019t be considered misogyny double standard much", "Leave lol fuck off with that shit can be anywhere I want to be", "First of all I can be anywhere I want lol \n\nSecond of all If the same comment were made towards men it wouldn\u2019t be considered misogyny double standard much", "If it's a financial burden than don't go. Plus, it wouldn't make sense to ask them of they need help if he himself cannot afford it. I guess as an adult, I don't understand being jealous of a child. I'm 8 years older than my brother. It would never bother me when my mom would ask me to split the cost of rental cars, hotels, gas, etc., and not him, whenever we traveled. This is even after he started working. I was better off than he was, so I understood.", "You little troll you", "You can\u2019t see that you\u2019re holding your stepdaughters to a different standard? If you feel that adults should pay their own expenses, then that\u2019s what should happen. Your son\u2019s gf\u2019s parents should be paying for the full cost of her trip, not you. If they can\u2019t afford it, she can\u2019t go. Isn\u2019t that how you feel about your stepdaughters? I\u2019m not saying you should pay your stepdaughters\u2019 portion of the trip but you should enforce your standards consistently and you\u2019re doing that", "If the same comments were made about men, it would be called misandry, and still sexist", "You're right, it would be called misandry.  If you're going to troll, at least do a better job of it.", "Except within 50-yards of a school or playground.", "Why doesn\u2019t that same logic apply to the gf? That\u2019s my question. When the gf said she couldn\u2019t afford to go, OP immediately volunteered to help but when it comes to the stepdaughters,  OP didn\u2019t even ask if they needed any help. I\u2019m not saying pay the full costs or even half of it but at least find out if there\u2019s something you can do since  that\u2019s what you did for non family member.", "I\u2019ve seen women say blatantly sexist things and be cheered or encouraged not held accountable but a man even disagrees with a women it\u2019s sexist", "Just responded to this same comment", "I\u2019ve seen women make blatant sexist comments about men and it\u2019s encouraged or cheered not called out yet men even disagree with a women and it\u2019s misogynistic seems like a double standard", "I\u2019ve literally seen women destroy there partners property for being annoyed slightly and it\u2019s laughed at yet men do the same thing there in jail", "Your essentially saying I\u2019m some kinda of pervert from this thread really judging people lol", "That\u2019s pretty presumptive of you lol you don\u2019t know anything about me judgy lol", "Maybe he promised it to the girlfriend before he told his daughter's about the trip? Regardless, he can spend his money however he wants. Family or not he's not wrong for wanting to help the one that is less fortunate versus the five grown adults that have no issue paying for themselves.", "And I see men make blatant sexist comments and get laughed at and cheered on by their friends. What's your point?", "You also didn't deny it.", "Whataboutism when women do it there\u2019s an excuse but men do it and there ridiculed people never hold women to the same standards they hold men", "Neither side is correct but Women seemingly get a pass when they do it and men essentially get ridiculed for it, I\u2019ve never witnessed a women taken to task for sexism but always seen it with men", "Deny what being a misogynist I didn\u2019t say the exact words but I explained my point as to why im not people don\u2019t listen once they make there initial judgement of you"]}
