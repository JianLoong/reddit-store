My brother told us that because he is friends with a \u2018trailer trash girl\u2019, his words not mine, he should be punished. He said he wants me, our sisters and our parents to arrive with empty boxes for my nephew to unwrap.\n\nHe plans to enjoy the look on my nephew\u2019s face as he opens each box and find nothing. Then he\u2019d laugh in my nephew\u2019s face and say \u2018Now you know what it\u2019s like to be disappointed.\u2019\n\nI told him \u2018No thanks, I\u2019m not a psycho.\u2019 He frowned and called me a \u2018spoil-sport\u2019, telling me I\u2019d be missing out on a \u2018lot of fun\u2019. That\u2019s my brother for you. \n\nWhen he kept pushing me I told him \u2018I\u2019m not gonna do it because I\u2019m not a poor excuse of a human being.\u2019\n\nOur mom immediately started to tell me off for disrespecting my older brother, saying there is no need for me to verbally attack him like that.

He has no place commenting on her life as a CHILD who can\u2019t just up and change things. Second, how weird it is to be shaming his own kid for having friends from different financial backgrounds. Honestly, he needs to grow up.

Is he the golden child by any chance?  Only thing I can think of as to why any parent would defend their child wanting to treat their grandchild in such a disgusting disgraceful manner on their birthday simply because of the economic status of the friend.
