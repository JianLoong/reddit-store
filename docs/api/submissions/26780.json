All you had to say was, \"I just got done with Chemo, I don't feel good.\" Closed your eyes and tuned him out. Let your Dad and his GF take care of anything else he has to say.

If he doesn\u2019t want to be called an asshole than he shouldn\u2019t act like an asshole. Only a scummy asshole calls a child with cancer a brat.  Your dad needs to check him.

In most states you do not have to let him in the house when he picks up his kids for visitation.  For him to verbally assault you is uncalled for.", "NTA. Why is he entering someone else's home and commenting on what they do in their home with their child? Unless it has tondo with the safety and wellbeing of his kids, he's out of line.

I think he should not be allowed in the house anymore. You don't need outside toxins as well as toxins inside your body. One set is bad enough.", "Yeah, NTA. He ought to be ashamed rather than doubling down on the rudeness to you. Even if you weren't sick he has no business accusing you of being lazy right at that moment - you could've simply been done with your chores for the day, or you and a stepsibling might have agreed to swap or something.", "NTA. Good luck with your treatments.", "You worded it cynically and sardonically... oh wait. You have no control of cynicism cause of cancer. You can just hide behind cancer to appeal  to our compassion and we are automatically your allies, so you don't have to take accountability for the real context you're scratching out. You are just innocent of all faults of lacking civility. cause of cancer. \n\nSee that? See how I worded it? You did it like that. But you do have chemo, so we can't hold you to certain standards and we can only say NTA by default. Get it?", "NTA. Your dad and his girlfriend should have handled this for you. Your step siblings are old enough to voice this, too.", "I would cuss all 3 of them out.They kids are old enough to understand", "NTA he simply effed around and found out. Get well soon Op", "NTA, and he can mind his business.  \n\n\nI'm wishing you the best! <3", "Exactly and I would argue OP's cancer/chemo is irrelevant. The dad is NOT a member of the household and has no say over what happens there and definitely NO say over OP. So why was he saying anything? \n\nAnd, as others have pointed out, OP could've been watching TV because they already completed their assigned chores. The dad can't simply walk into the house and assume he knows everything that is going on.", "Let us not always put the onus on the insulted to be the bigger person. Screw that AH", "They are not right. OP said it perfectly", "It's funny you say that because I heard the kids say \u201c but (my name) isn't a brat\u201d", "How the hell is the shitty dad \u201csupporting\u201d OP by calling him lazy FOR HAVING CANCER?! And you seem like a shit parent if you let anyone talk to your kid like the dad did and not let her defend herself, cancer or not. Way to prepare your kid for a life of being a door mat.", "So you're excusing someone who is not a parent to OP talking down to them about the aftereffects of their chemo. While proclaiming you have a child in similar circumstances and yet you still try to admonish OP for defending themself from someone who knew better as a parent and an adult.\n\nMan the lack of self awareness must make your life so much interesting. /s", "Also not his kid to try to boss around.", "Why phrase things politely to an asshole who\u2019s being an asshole?", "It's always your place to defend yourself when someone is unjustly criticizing you within earshot.", "They were in another room and couldn't say something fast enough my dad ended up telling him off when he came back with the kids", "Hey, my friend. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this right now. CANCER. IS. A. LOT.\n\nNot only are you NTA, even if you were TA you would totally get a pass from me because cancer.\n\nIf the kids\u2019 dad doesn\u2019t want to look like an AH in front of his kids maybe he shouldn\u2019t\u2026 I dunno\u2026 act like an AH?\n\nYes, maybe it would\u2019ve been kinder not to point out his AHness but that\u2019s not really a you problem.

It can take over your whole world, I know.\n\nI will keep you in my prayers.", "Sorry but your dad is an asshole. Imagine not siding your child that has cancer and caring more about the stepdad feelings towards how you word your sentence.\n\nWhat a disappointment for a dad.", "i know you probably have gotten many comments like this (on the post or irl) but i do hope you get well soon!", "Exactly. If he doesn\u2019t know what goes on in their house, he shouldn\u2019t comment on it.", ">I would argue OP's cancer/chemo is irrelevant. The dad is NOT a member of the household and has no say over what happens there and definitely NO say over OP. So why was he saying anything?\n\nWell, the dad's kids live in the household.  It is his job to advocate for them.  We get enough stories here about divorced or widowed parents starting a new relationship, and marginalizing their kids while favoring the step-kids.  \n\nWithout the illness, it would be massively unfair if the 15 year old was allowed to skip chores while the other two were expected to do their chores.\n\nHowever, if the dad was concerned his kids were being treated unfairly with chores, that should be addressed with the kids' mother, perhaps with OP's dad in the discussion as well.  He shouldn't have brought it up with OP.\n\nHave the younger two kids been complaining to their dad about being treated unfairly?  Has the situation with the cancer and chemo been explained to them clearly, in ways that are age-appropriate  so they understand?  The kids are young enough that they probably have no previous experience of living closely with someone who has severe illness and treatments that leave them weak and unable to do their share.  Teaching them how to handle this politely is going to have to be an ongoing task, not a matter of just one or two conversations. \n\nAlso, how do the girlfriend's kids, in general, feel about moving in with mom's boyfriend and his child?  \n\nNone of those things are OP's problem or responsibility.  But if OP's dad and his girlfriend are reading this, some gentle exploration of how the younger two kids are feeling about the situation, and working to create a peaceful home that respects the feelings and needs of all three children seem to be something that needs to be attended to.", "All of us in this sub are 100000% on your side. So sorry you are going through this. And you are being productive by resting. Fighting cancer is hard work and your body needs all the rest it can get.", "Hey, listen to me, please listen.\n\nYour body needs the rest.  You are poisoning your body to save yourself, hoping the poison will kill the cancer faster than it harms you.    Talk to your doctor, I bet they will tell you to rest, that they would be willing to talk to your parents about what is normal to be able to do or not do after chemo.\n\nThere is no shame in the rest, you are being very productive.  You are surviving cancer, surviving a brutal treatment that hopefully will give you a long, healthy life in the end.  \n\nI sympathize with hating the tiredness.  \n\nBut I am oldster these days, I am coming up on 50.  \n\nAnd I deeply regret all the times I didn't rest and coddle my body.  I walked on sprains because I wanted to be productive and now my knees and ankles are constant source of pain.  I had mono and didn't take the rest the doctors wanted me to and it took far, far longer to heal and I have issues today from being \"productive\" despite what my body needed.\n\nListen to your body, listen to your doctors and give yourself the space to recover and to eventually heal.  \n\nYou are worth more than that which your produce.", "I thought it was the kids that said something.  It was a whole grown adult? \n\nOh heck no. Not pull verbal punches for that a-h. If he hasn\u2019t grown a brain by now, he needs to be shamed by a teenager. \n\nFuck cancer! Keep fighting and don\u2019t give this another thought. NTA", "I'm so sorry for what you are going through. Screw cancer. You got this! I will send many good vibes your way. I wish you well. NTA\n\nEdit:add a sentence", "Rest is not unproductive. It's an essential maintenance and repair activity, so it's okay to try to get good at it. I'm talking duvet, soft music if you like but mostly just close your eyes and think about nice things.", "[deleted]", "Your job, your productivity is to do what you can to heal your body.", "But the kids need to see we stand up against wrong, even in our own family. One of the worst things we can do to kids is make them believe that \"older equates automatically being deserving of respect\" and to not call out crap behaviour in adults. \n\nIf he didn't want to get a very obvious answer to his stupid comment, he should have kept his trap shut. He literally belittled a cancer fighter in front of his kids, he is trying to breed bullies. You taught kids what should happen when you see bullying, even sick with chemo, you're being a great sibling at guiding them. \u2764\ufe0f You are a great role model", "Nope. YOU are who matters her OP. \"Keeping the Peace\" is a bullshit excuse to let others abuse you. Hell no. Your Dad failed here big time.", "Fight in your spirit keeps the immune system going (or at least, it can't hurt to stand up for yourself). Hope you stomp cancer hard and take no shit from anyone. Don't even worry about people chiding your wording, girls are always being told to be soft and gentle to everyone at all times and this is frankly not the kind of world where that's even in their best interest. Maybe the kids learned something useful thanks to you", "haha maybe the kids will give their dad more shit for it", "I\u2019m sorry. You are definitely NTA.", "It's more about keeping the peace my dad was about to tell him off but he called me a brat and told his kid he's waiting outside I just reacted be for my dad could say anything", "OP said that Dad was going to tell off the other kids' dad. Dad was being caring, OP just spoke up before her dad did", "> Well, the dad's kids live in the household. It is his job to advocate for them. \n\nQuite seriously, if you think your kids are being taken advantage of in your ex's household, the thing to do is to see about getting more custody. If you live close enough to visit but you're not willing to advocate for your child by having them stay with you 50/50, then whatever.", "Thank you Ive always been a person who can't sit still  I know I need to rest I just hate feeling unproductive and like I've done nothing the whole day I once told my nurse that and she basically told me the same thing you just wrote", "Leukemia (ALL) and that's great", "I think they did because he got mad and texted my dads girlfriend that his kids shouldn't side with a person who isn't even related to them more than him... Plus my dad told him off when he came back to drop the kids off", "The username checks out.", "Blessings to you love. I pray for your strength while you fight this battle. NTA", "I think you did great, you stuck up for yourself. That man may have an adult body, but clearly not mentality, and calling someone an asshole is, in my opinion, pretty darn mild in this context. I understand if you want to be considerate around the kids, that\u2019s kind and respectful of you, but they will survive this just fine and you shouldn\u2019t be expected to be anything but human. NTA", "Good for you, you stuck up for yourself! NTA. That guy was way out of line. \nI'm wishing you all the best as you kick cancer's ass! \u2764\ufe0f", "Your dad needed to do his damn job and care for his kid, how dare he imply you were wrong!", "Oh hell no.  It's not your job to keep the piece.  This guy has no business coming into YOUR home and try to assert any sort of dominance there.  It undermines both your Dad and the mother of his kids.  This guy would never be permitted to enter my home, again.", "I was always on the move if a book wasn't in my hands.  I understand.  But you got dealt a bad hand, and your body needs you to respect it and get your rest.  \n\nRight now, living is being productive.  Seriously, chemo is awful, just better than alternative.", "I can definitely say that the sooner you learn to put your health and rest first, the better off you'll be. Probably live a hell of a lot longer and happier than us older generations who bought the \"work through any illness or you're lazy\" propaganda. You've got a whole lot of people here rooting for you, keep kicking cancer's ass and get the rest you deserve. NTA, either, it was really inappropriate for the guy to address his concerns in front of you and even worse that he didn't back off.", "Damn I\u2019m sorry I misread your post in my post work haze! \n\nAnyways what I said about my cousin being five years cancer free etc. I still mean. And my ruling stands NTA!!!", "It is very awful I didn't think it would be as hard as it is honestly but it's rough especially the first few days after my round of chemo finishes"]}
