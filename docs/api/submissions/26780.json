The kid\u2019s dad saw him and asked why his kids had to do all the chores and I just got to lay around. He knows I have cancer too. Before my dad or his gf could reply I said I just finished a round of chemo 2 days ago that\u2019s why\u2026 would you make your kids do chores after having toxins go in their body\u2026 if so then your a big asshole.

You now know one reason your stepmom is not with her ex anymore. Lack of empathy and inability to apologize when proven wrong.\n\n\"Imagine your kids had cancer\" is not the worst answer to give to a \"Why isn't the cancer kid doing chores?\", so I think your dad and stepmom are trying too much to placate the ex, probably to keep the peace.

People who don't live there shouldn't be coming in your house unnecessarily while you're more susceptible to infection, and certainly not with all the crap going around.

I hope you feel better soon.", "NTA Your Dad and GF are right you could have worded things differently. That being said, you're allowed some slack at 15.

Good luck with your treatment OP", "NTA", "NTA. \n\nCould you have handled it with more tact? Sure.

Your father & stepmother are correct - you could have phrased it differently & gotten your point across all the same. That said, do I think it was all that bad? No. He sounds like a jerk.
