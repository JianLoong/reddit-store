Give us our ball!!\".  \nAnd I do think we were home, but we were taking care of our sick foster kittens in our basement and just didn't hear the doorbell or knocking. Our laundry room, especially when we have the dryer on, is pretty far and disconnected from the house.  \n\n\nAnyways, they knocked again today and I asked where their parents were. I got their ball, and then saw their grandma (our neighbor) standing on the property line.

I don't really like having them peer into our windows, it's an invasion of privacy, etc.   \n\n\nThe kids then said \"But your cat came to the window and we had to see it!\"  And I turned to the kids to explain I'm always happy to grab their ball for them, but when they knock on our door they need to stay by the door. It's not polite to peer through windows.  \n\n\nThe neighbor then said \"Come on boys, she doesn't want you on her property.

Is that really unreasonable? I didn't think this would be an AH thing to do, but her response made me feel really bad. My husband also doesn't love the kids peering through the window, but he's less confrontational than I am and is very \"meh\" about the whole thing.  \nBut this is now really bothering me so I wanted outside perspectives.   \n\n\nI didn't think it would be a big deal to say something, but they're responding as if I told them I despise kids and to never let them near my property again and that's not how I feel.", "created_utc": 1686936138, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14b2l7a/aita_for_not_wanting_the_neighborhood_kids/", "score": 164, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yes, you *shouldn't have to* - but sometimes it's an effective option.", "NTA.\n\nYou were in the right and they were in the wrong.  But you can't basically tell your neighbor that they don't know how to raise polite children without offending them.\n\nIf you want it to stop and you don't want to keep your drapes closed, you might want to try that privacy film you can put on the window glass.  If they can't see anything they will stop looking.", "NTA\n\nThese kids are seriously overstepping boundaries and you've been incredibly patient with them. You aren't required to return their things once they wind up on your property AT ALL; much less at their beck and call. \n\nI wouldn't read too much into their sudden absence. I'm sure they'll be back to being aggravating in no time.\n\nIf you're really concerned about hurting your neighbor's feelings, wait until the kids aren't around and speak to her about it one on one.", "NTA. I read the whole post, try to move on.", "NTA. You didn't say anything wrong.\n\nI suggest putting one-way privacy mirror film on your windows.

Sounds like grandma is an entitled boomer that thinks just cause \"their her grandkids!\" They can do whatever they want. Honestly I was trying to think of a way that you could deter them from peeking in your windows instead of being forced to cover them(blinds or curtains), maybe keep some paired socks handy and if you catch them being peeping Tom's you can throw it at the window to startle them away? A pair of socks is just heavy enough / hard enough to make a satisfying bonk against the window but you'd be hard-pressed to throw it hard enough to actually bust anything. And socks are just innocuous enough to say oh I was trying to squash a fly on the window or toss them into my laundry basket that is conveniently by my front window...\nSounds like their grandma / mother / rest of their family isn't going to teach them any manners so it's probably time to learn the hard way....  \n\nPs, my brain read this first as neighbor kids *peeing* in your windows and I immediately thought \"I got to see this!\"", "Originally read this as \"peeing though my windows\". You had to ask?!", "NTA, No one likes their privacy being invaded. The kids need to learn to not look into other people's windows.

You're alot more patient & kind.", "NTA.\n\nNoone wants anybody peering through their window.\n\nIf it happens often enough, get some blinds or window stickers.\n\nBut maybe since they are playing on the other side of the yard, it won't be much of  a problem anymore....", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA.

It basically makes your window a mirror on the outside so no one can see inside but you can see outside just fine. That way the kids won't be able to actually see inside no matter how hard they (rudely) try to look. I had to do this to my lower floor windows because A) I love sunlight in my house and so always have blinds open B) I have expensive consoles visible in the living room and C) I've already had one rude kid peer into my backdoor and then knock and beg to pet my cat. The extra privacy can't be overstated and I get to keep my blinds open during the day with no worries about people being able to see inside.\n\nNow, night is a different story. The mirror affect doesn't work at night when you have lights on inside but it doesn't sound like you have issues at night.", "> The neighbor then said \"Come on boys, she doesn't want you on her property.

You can't tell people not to look into them to any effect. There are tons of options for protecting your privacy, but it's ineffective to tell children not to look through glass.
