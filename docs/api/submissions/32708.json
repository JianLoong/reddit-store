In the end, he DID leave them some money - and he could have donated it all to some NGO.\n\nIf anyone thinks your cousins NEED the money, then they're more than welcome to put it up themselves. Also, it is incredibly disgraceful to instigate a squabble over inheritance.\n\nEnjoy your money, be smart with it, and live a good life.\n\nIf your cousins ever need cash in the future, and you decide to give them some - then it's your call.

Your money is yours, to do with what you please.", "NTA.  Also consider that when one heir receives more than another, it's because the one who received less already received a partial inheritance via a forgiven loan or some other form of payment.  So... perhaps your grandfather covered the bail or legal fees for the cousin who went to jail, hence the disparity?", " NTA. What sacrifices are your uncle and father making?  If they\u2019re not, why should you be?  Why isn\u2019t your uncle sharing with your cousins?", "NTA\n\nI expect your grandfather may have done the inheritance as my parents were going to do it. They split everything in half. My brother and I will split the properties and the grandkids will get the cash. Now the cash was split in half, but my brother and I don't get the cash it goes to the kids; so my birth child would get 1/2 and my brother's birth children would split the other half and get less because he has more kids. I told my parents to just split evenly. My son would give the money to his cousins if they pressed him on it and I don't want him to face any tax penalties. He would essentially be gifting money and with the way our state taxes gifts it would cost him money to give them money.", "If your aunt and uncle think that the cousins should get more money, they should reach down in their own pocket to give it to them.  \nGrandpa had his own reasons \n\nSo very sorry for your loss", "NTA. Everyone will have a reason that they deserve or need more of the money. Just honor the will.", "NTA. You are under absolutely no obligation to give your cousins money because it \u201ccould help your cousin get along.\u201d  It is your money. They don\u2019t get to tell you to give any of it away or decide who needs it more. Your uncle can sell his portion of the house or possessions and give that money to his needy child.", "NTA. You're grandfather made his will how he wanted it. Tell your uncle if he cares so much he can give them the money", "NTA.   \n\n\nTell them you\u2019re following classic advice and making no decisions about your financial windfall for at least a year. Everything can sit in an account for a year while you work out what you\u2019ll do with it. Tell them you\u2019ll update your will to bequeath it to them. You can always change your will the day after anyway to whatever the next thing is ;)   \n\n\nAnd\u2026let it sit for a year. See how the next year plays out. Take time to learn what you can do with that money. Take time to make a life further away from them either socially or physically if that\u2019s what you want. Go be the best version of yourself. That money represents freedom to take small risks and try new things.
