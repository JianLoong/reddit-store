If he's in state maybe he even can live at home and the bill would be less extreme and you can revisit helping or not.

Is she going to want you to buy him a car or a house or supplement his income down the road?  You are very generous to help your mom but you need to draw a firm line and hold to it.  (We help my MIL with property taxes, insurance and occasional big expenses like a water heater or HVAC system.  But there is a limit to how much we can or are willing to help financially.)  Let us know what happens!  Good luck!", "NTA, but your mother is especially for asking for money for your younger brother and not asking him to make any concessions.", "NTA.

This wasn't a case where she paid for yours, expecting you to help pay for those behind you. You all have the same opportunity: Here is X amount of money for college. Your brother should have been more responsible and stayed in state, and your mother should done better at explaining to your brother that the 529 was the only money he has for college so either go somewhere it will pay for or he should find a way to supplement the rest.", "NTA choices have consequences.

You made the responsible choice and stayed within reason. Your brother did not, and now has to deal with that. Classic FAFO.", "NTA... it's not like there was nothing left when it came to your brother - they just chose unwisely.  They need to make a diff plan and it doesnt need to involve you.", "NTA. You each had the same opportunities, you capitalized on yours, while your brother squandered his. How is HIS mistake suddenly YOUR problem?\n\nIt\u2019s nice that you wanna support your mom, but that means helping her out when she gets sick, or letting her move in with you when she gets old, take her on a trip maybe, it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re her checkbook to fund whatever lavish and extravagant unnecessary expenses she might decide to incur.\n\nYour mother made a huge mistake by not explaining to your brother that there isn\u2019t money for an out of state school, but it\u2019s his education and his responsibility. If your mom wants to help him that\u2019s nice, but it doesn\u2019t seem like she can afford to, and it\u2019s certainly not a Spooder problem", "NTA You aren't your brother's keeper.", "My mom insists we let him finish school there so that isn't an option apparently", "He can't really pay for his own education if he is in school and my mother refuses to take out student loans, so neither of them can really pay it off.", "I agree, subsidizing one of us over the other definitely seems unfair but that's how it usually is with the youngest child in the family.", "He doesn't qualify for it and my mom won't consider student loans as an option.", "We did get the same tuition on our 529s", "I already tried bringing up the idea of him moving back to in-state but it was quickly turned down by both of them. \n\nI don't want to mess up the relationship I have with them but at the same time the request is just so unreasonable. There was no financial game plan from day 1 either, he just went to school and burned through his funds and here we are.", "Wouldn't it be seen as turning my back on my family?", "But I should still be paying back my mother for raising me, and I still have an obligation to support my family to some degree. I just don't know where to draw the line in this situation due to all the negligence involved.", "My mom wants to let him finish the degree at his current school.", "Yeah, hard agree. Honestly I am more pissed that there was no game plan before she said yes to him attending the school. It just came up one day \"Oh by the way, your younger brother ran out of 529 funding and we need to pay $30k per semester\". It just baffles me that she didn't see this coming whatsoever.", "I heard a good money policy is that if you give it to friends or family, it is gone and you should not expect to get it back otherwise your relationships get messed up.", "Wouldn't that be extortion? Like it's not his responsibility to pay for his brother. Both of them got the same amount of money and the other guy made the conscious decision to move out of state. And given the favoritism, the relationship is already damaged", "I definitely feel that way, and I appreciate the advice. Of course I want to support my family but the negligence in both my mother and brother make the decision difficult.", "Then she can figure out how to afford it.  You graduated without debt and would probably have enjoyed an out of state party school too but you did the mature thing and stayed in budget. Offer to help find loans, or fill out application for paid internships and jobs, or find another school but you have your own expenses and you are not funding your brother education. This will upset your mom and she is within her rights to be upset but she can\u2019t tell you what to do with your life or your money.\n  This will be a very upsetting situation to deal with for quite sometime.  We had a similar situation with my parents it did not involve $$$ but did involve personal choices.  We were being unfair to my sister by making choices my parents thought were wrong and we should have been more considerate and changed our life plans to not upset my sibling .  It has been over 20 years and this subject is still brought up several times a year that what we chose to do was wrong.  It wasn\u2019t wrong it just wasn\u2019t what my parents wanted to do and I don\u2019t regret the decisions we made then. Just live your best life and realize making mom happy sometimes is best for you.", "Nta. Helping your mom does not mean doing everything she asks especially when she and your brother are making selfish  irresponsible decisions at your expense.   There are consequences to choices. stand your ground. Your brother can either take loans or move home.  If they think you will cave they will do what they want at your expense.", "Insist that that makes no financial sense and if that's the route they want to go that's on them. Also if he goes to a more reputable in state school than the party school he's at now, it'll be better for future job prospects, not just cheaper", "Then she can pay for it. If you\u2019re paying for it you get a say.", "In that case, it's time for student loans. No family involvement necessary.", "Then he better figure out how to pay the bill. Absolutely not your responsibility. Also, take a good look at your moms spending before you support her.  It sounds like she is very unrealistic about money and should no get support from others until she budgets and spends properly", "How about he takes a semester off to earn money for tuition? It will teach him the value of money and he might even decide a more affordable school is better when his friends progress ahead of him", "This sounds like a \"them\" problem.  Your brother certainly can take out student loans, he just doesn't want to.", "He can get a job, do work study, apply for loans himself.  This is NOT YOUR problem to solve.", "I have a horrible feeling she may make sacrifices or use her living money to pay, then ask you to help with HER expenses.", "Your brother can take out student loans. Where are you getting your info from?", "That's not how it usually is in healthy families.", "Student loans are a form of financial aid", "You keep saying you don't want to mess up the relationship. It was completely screwed by your mother and brother. It is not on you to fix the mess they made. You do not owe your mother for raising you and you do not need to pay her back for doing her job. It is so disturbing how many children think they OWE their parents. If the only reason your mother has kids is to financially support her, she is disgusting.", "Nope. You played by the rules. Your brother was allowed not to play by those same rules. This is on him. Time to gear up for loans for him.", "Unless they have a feasible plan that you want to support - you dont hand over anything. It's not logical to throw money away.", "Where do you get this idea that you should pay back your mother for raising you?  She chose to have you.  It is her legal obligation to house, feed, and cloth you.  You owe her nothing.  You owe your younger brother nothing either.  Please don't let them guilt you into spending your hard earned money on them.", "You don't though. Your mother chose to have you and your brother, you didn't ask to be born, you absolutely do not have to pay her back for raising you.", "A parent chooses to have children. They are responsible for raising them to adulthood. No repayment is owed.", "She\u2019s stuck, then. Her only options are loans. I\u2019m assuming you don\u2019t have $90k laying around. If I were you, I wouldn\u2019t foot this bill AND I wouldn\u2019t give my mom any money at all until whatever loans she\u2019s taking out get paid off. Otherwise, she\u2019ll use your money to pay off his debt. \n\nIt\u2019s baffling that she did this without a plan.", "What your mom wants and what your brother and she can afford are completely different things.  You are not the family piggy bank.", "She saw it coming. She just didn't want to come to you about it until the last possible moment. \n\nDid your middle brother go to an in-state school?", "I know I shouldn't be paying for my brother, but I should be paying back my mom for raising me. I just don't know if this situation can be considered \"paying back\" my mom.", "I wish but my mother won't even consider putting him through student loans.", "My bad, but regardless she is not even considering student loans.", "I am actually the middle brother. Both my older and younger brother are still in school, but the older brother goes to in-state community college.", "> but I should be paying back my mom for raising me\n\nNo, you really should not. You are not an investment, you are not an indentured servant, and you do not owe your parents payback for them choosing to have you.\n\nThat whole mindset is so fucked up.\n\nIt's okay to help family out, that's different. But payback? Fuck no.", "Look, I come from a culture that deeply values filial devotion so I get it.  But please stop thinking of your situation as \"owing\" your mother,  Raising you and your brothers is the obligation she took on by having all of you in the first place.  It took me a long time to understand that parental respect is earned, not owed.  It's hard, I know but bailing them out of their own poor decisions indefinitely will be heck of a lot harder.  As you point out, your mother/bro's negligence with respect to tuition is a culmination of life-long favoritism and coddling.  They shit the bed and must clean it up themselves.", "I think the best thing you can do is help him identify options for student aid, scholarships and a PT job.\n\nThere are tons of resources out there that can help. I would not pay for his tuition, helping your mom and paying for you brothers tuition are two different things. If your brothers tuition is paid, not sure how that helps your mom in the long run. \n\nUltimately she can\u2019t make money out of thin air.", "In my opinion, no. Paying for parents means stuff like paying off a credit card debt or helping with the mortgage or taking them out to do something fun that they never got to do because they didn't have the funds.\n\nThis is also not helping your brother, because he's not being financially independent and this might hurt your mom in the long run.", "It's not up to her.  HE can apply for them without her, yeah?", "That's HER choice. You do not have to subsidize her refusal to consider options that make your brother responsible for his choices.", "Yeah, I would tell mom that you were grateful for what she did for you and that you were able to have a debt free college experience. HOWEVER, with that being said, that you and your bro were resourceful enough to realize you guys needed to stay in-state to have college totally paid for, and that if you stayed in state and weren't willing to go into debt for your own tuition then you certainly won't be doing it for your brother's."]}
