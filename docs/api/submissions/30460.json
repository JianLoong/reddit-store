I understand you need a break, I've been watching my dad have to deal with a similar situation with his FIL for years now.

I made sure of that. I brought the things she uses like her shower chair as I knew my brother wouldn't have one. My niece also stated that she would be going over frequently to check on her and if things got \"bad\" she would let me know. Unlike my brother I call my mom and check on her as well. I told her if she needs to come back sooner we can do that.", "That might be the plan moving forward but I am leaving that decision to her. Its her house, her decision.", "No she isn't confined to a chair unless she is looking at facebook or youtube. She runs on cereal and PB&J and relies on someone for anything else. My mom was involved in the decision to go back down there for a change of pace and the food. When I brought up the idea she got very excited. I wouldn't have considered having her there if my niece wasn't available to help. I did tell her we need to look into a maid service that can deep clean each room and we can do a room at a time at my brothers expense and to look for a handy man. If I was closer I would do it myself.", "I don't want to put her in a home. I have a room. I just want her to be motivated to take care of herself and get better. Her house is a mess but it is livable. While she may not be comfortable she will be fine. She also very much wanted to go down to her house. As we were driving down her street she said \"This feels like home\".\n\nIf anything else she will get the inspiration to get better or to finally sell her house that her other son is destroying.", "Its habitable just not as nice as my house. My GF and I feel that she has become to comfortable. She does not do her speech therapy, she doesn't do her exercises she just sits in her room and watches TV all day. My intention was to show her that it is better here so that way she would be somewhat motivated. Currently as it sits it feels like she is just waiting to pass on and I am trying to change that", "Caregivers were covered for the 1st year now it would be out of pocket. She is good about taking her pills and I do plan on trying to figure out a maid and handy man for her.", "She does not want to sell her house at least right now. Maybe after seeing how bad her house has been cared for that might change. My mom prefers to be alone, I have tried everything to entice her out to participate in family gatherings, parties, outings and she prefers to sit in her room and watch NCIS. While my brother is an asshole he might be able to annoy her enough to get her moving around and talking and doing the things she should be doing. I am man enough to admit that I failed in keeping on her. It feels like she needs someone in her face all day to get her to do the things she needs to do. I just don't have the energy anymore. I am hoping my brother can do what I can't.", "My mom wont go to a home unless I am unable to physically take care of her.  There are many reasons for this move, most of which is motivation.

Brother can get dropped on the curb if he doesn't like it.", "Irrelevant: it's the mom's house.", "Start looking for respite programs. These are not the same as PSW\u2019s.  These people are trained in whatever disorder they are providing care for but they are there so you can get a break. I used to do respite and the people were so glad to get 8 hrs or 24hrs breaks.", "That's... not exactly what I meant. Shower chair is great, but you left her with someone who's already not taking care of where he lives. How can you be sure he's going to drive her where she needs to go or take care of the house well enough for her to safely live there?", "Maybe hire a monthly cleaner who cleans nce a month or once a week.", "You need to find some places she can tour. Without touring she can\u2019t make an informed decision.", "Well seems totally reasonable to me, except for your brother feeling a bit put out seems like a win all around; you guys get a break, your mom gets a change, your niece gets to spend time with her grandma, and probably your brother gets a cleaner house.  And I expect he will step up at least somewhat when she is right in front of him.   It's not like she can't state her own needs.  Excellent.", "OP I totally understand your frustration.  My dad had a stroke and did not recover as well as he could have. If it was easier to get someone to do something for him rather than try to do it himself he would always prefer that. We begged him to exercise. He always claimed he did, but no one ever saw him.", "You wanted to show her it was better in your brother\u2019s unkept house with cobwebs and dog hair and computer components all over the floor? Living with a \u2018stubborn asshole\u2019? Sure makes sense.", "So you have consulted her doctor? Physical therapists?  You may be right that she could make more of an effort, I'm just asking if you have a long-term plan in place.  We all age and we all get to a point where we can no longer take care of ourselves.", "He can't keep a house. You expect him to be motivated to help his mother? More likely he will let her eat PBJ and cereal as long as he gets to do what he wants. Why would he care if she doesn't leave the room? I hope I am wrong.", "Just re read and totally missed that part. \n\nNta, he's a huge ah.", "My niece is available and was part of the decision to have her go down there. She will have help and someone that can let me know if it becomes dangerous for her to be there.", "BTW at least where I live physios will come to you (paid for various different ways depending on the situation).  Or, they will come and teach the exercises to a family member or a hired companion so that person can help the affected person.", "This is literally my mom lol. She will lie right to your face that she did something when she didn't. When Covid hit I was able to work from home so I was there when she had physical therapy I would get on her everyday. It was a constant thing I had to do. Once I went back to the office it seems she doesn't do much. There are a lot of things that I could do to prepare for her future but I know I would break her spirit if I did. I am just hoping my brother as annoying as he is can annoy some motivation out of her.", "No, I wanted to show her that she has three options. My brothers way of life, mine or a home. I have been doing everything for her these last 4 years and I think she has gotten complacent. She says she wants to get better, start driving again and doing the things she loves, but I feel my house is far to comfortable for her. She can sit back and relax and not have to take care of herself. If she has to struggle just a little maybe that will force her to do some rehab.\n\nNot sure if I am making any sense with that", "My mom was a VET so their care isn't the greatest but an advantage of having her at her house is she is 20 minutes from a Military hospital that can give her a much needed checkup. Almost none of the Doctors in my area (that are respectable) take Tri-care.", "He is very fond of telling other people what to do, not so much doing it on his own.", "We did that for almost a year, insurance wont pay for anymore. If she didn't have a house payment I could get that covered with her social security.", "I hope so too. There is a saying at hospitals and nursing homes about how amazing it is about some of the things some patients are capable of doing for themselves when they are alone in a room vs. when someone is with them.", "Well I\u2019m trying to understand. You\u2019re saying she has three options. Your house, a home or bro. But you took her out of your house and to bro. So it sounds like she has two options not three. Or maybe more accurately, you just don\u2019t want her in your house 100% of the time (COMPLETELY understandable). \n\nI\u2019m in the weird situation of needing to move my dad to assisted living and at the same time might need to do the same for myself due to chronic illness. It\u2019s hard to admit when you need a higher level of care, but it seems quite clear she\u2019s there. If I were you I\u2019d be pushing that and looking at options because it seems the inevitable outcome. Even if your brother stepped up, which we both know he won\u2019t, it\u2019s temporary and she\u2019ll wind up in a home anyway unless you can manage higher and higher levels of care in your home.", "Well, you seem to know that your brother is all talk,no show.", "My idea was to have her go back and forth between my brother and I every 2 months until she either doesn't want to go or needs a higher level of care. She basically did this with her mother when she was diagnosed with Dementia. I just wanted to take a break but also give her a chance to see what her other option is while also motivating her to get better.", "Ok, so the two options are 50/50 w brother or a home. Have you made this plan clear to her, repeatedly (given she may have some limitations or denial going on)? \n\nIt sounds like your brother doesn\u2019t want her in his home, so is this even a sustainable plan that he agreed to? \n\nSure seems to me like your only long term options are you 100% or a home. \n\nIt\u2019s ok if you do not want to be an option. This is a situation many of us face when parents start to decline. There\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of if you don\u2019t want to have her with you 100%. I wouldn\u2019t be capable or willing of taking in either parent. But you would be a good daughter to ensure she has a comfortable, safe clean environment to live in. And I\u2019m sure that\u2019s your goal already.", "Something has been lost in translation. My mom is still going to live with me until I can't physically care for her (as in she needs 24 hour care). This is just a temp situation to give myself and my woman a break and to recharge her batteries so to speak. I'm hoping in a couple months she comes back with a new purpose. Don't just exist.", "Ugh, this may be a really unpopular opinion but I'm going to share my perspective anyway because your story really resonates. \n\nLet me first say, it's 100% understandable that you and your partner need to share the responsibility of helping to care for your mom, especially with 4 littles of your own. \n\nMy maternal grandmother also got to the point where she couldn't live alone, and my mom was the only one who welcomed her into her home to help care for her. For context, she has two other brothers, and two other sisters. My mom also got really burned out because she was caring 24/7 for my critically ill little brother, but also her mom, so she needed a break. \n\nOne of my aunt's offered to let her stay with them a for a month or two so Mom could regroup, but we all knew that Aunt was not going to be the kind of caregiver she deserved, for many of the same reasons you mentioned above, lack of cleanliness being tops on the list. \n\nBut Mom really needed a break, and it was only supposed to be for a month or two. The problem was, the same people who couldn't be bothered to clean their house, couldn't be bothered either to make sure my grandmother was properly cared for, kept clean, fed well, toenails and fingernails cut, and worse still, they didn't watch her like they should, and she was pretty spaced out at that point too. \n\nBy the time we realized how horribly she was being neglected it was too late. She fell, and when we got to the hospital her toe nails were ingrown, and she was absolutely filthy. She didn't know who we were, which was also new, and the stress on her body was just too much and she passed away. \n\nWe all still have a lot of guilt about how it all went down, especially my mom. She didn't do anything wrong, and you're not wrong to need some support, but just be sure you're leaving her with people that will care for her properly and not neglect her. I know you don't want that, and I'm sorry you don't have a better support system in your sibling. \n\nI don't know where you live, but Medicare will pay for home healthcare aides to come and assist with your mom if she qualifies. It's also worth reaching out to whatever local resources are available for people of advanced age in your county or city. I know our county has programs that help families like yours, but every place is different. \n\nWishing you all the very best as you try to get through this, I know it's not easy and I commend you for doing your very best in a difficult situation.", "NTA. You didn't drop your mother off at your brother's. You took her home to the house she owns and pays for. It sounds like your mother wanted to be back in her own house and she seems to be of sound mind so her opinion on the matter is the most important. As long as your niece is checking in on her regularly to make sure her needs are being meet, then you should be fine to see how it works for 2 months.", ">he never wants me to go back there\n\nSince it isn't he house, his wants don't matter.

Maybe it's time to sell her house and let her move into one of those retirement communities. Check out what's available in your area.

This was a remarkably cruel thing to do to your mother.  She's \"self-sufficient\" and you're dumping her into the house of a total slob who doesn't want her there.\n\nCaring for the elderly is really hard.  But dumping her on your brother's doorstep was the second-worst thing you could have done.  (The first worst being dumping her into the street.)\n\nGoogle \"elder services\" for your local area.  Call them.   Ask for options for respite care.", "YTA. I know you're at your limit, but your brother is clearly in NO state to care for your mother, and you just ditched her there with someone who doesn't even want her around. That is unbelievably cruel to her. How your brother feels about it isn't the issue here - it's that your mother needs help, and you abandoned her where she isn't going to get it. You need to find a better solution for this situation, because expecting your brother - who can't or won't sweep up dog hair - to care for a disabled human being is absolutely ridiculous. \n\nPlease check actively and often on your mother, and figure out how to get her into an assisted care facility. You have opened her up to elder abuse, and need to take responsibility for that.", "YTA. This sounds like straight up elder abuse.", "NTA. You've stopped enabling both your mother and your brother, which has made them both super unhappy, but that's hopefully going to mean some overdue changes will happen. You've been stuck in a very lopsided arrangement where you make all the sacrifices caring for your mother while your brother takes advantage of her house without helping out.\n\nIt sucks taking responsibility for aging parents but you seem to have done your due diligence that she'll be safe even if she and your brother are not happy, and you're giving your mother a reasonable set of options for her care going forward. It's a very thankless and draining responsibility, but you are still putting your time and effort in to make it work.", "NTA", "NTA your brother sounds like a massive loser though and I would be somewhat worried about your mother welfare with him being responsible for her wellbeing.", "NTA and if your mom\u2019s capable I\u2019d talk with her about giving you power of attorney or whatever authority is needed to get your brother out of her house.  He\u2019s destroying its value and he\u2019s using her instead of caring about her.  In fact, is she even safe alone in the house with him?  He doesn\u2019t sound like someone eho\u2019s going to put her needs first.  She may not be able to live there by herself but it\u2019s a seller\u2019s market and maybe sone of the money for selling the house could be used to hire some home health care for your mom so you can get a break now and then.", "i mean NTA for needing a break. but your mom will either be miserable there or she gets her other son under control. dunno how fit she is, but does not sound like she is capable of doing that", "It can be hard to do financial stuff when someone has had a stroke. My grandmother was legally unable to deal with any of her property (house, car, or business) and so we had to decide let it sit in limbo or allow family to use the house, you need different types of insurance if the house is sitting empty.  It's apparently done to prevent financial abuse, because it forces the estate to sit unchanged until the person dies unfortunately.\nI mean it's supposed to prevent abuse, but really I just got to watch my one cousin rack up speed camera speeding tickets in the car was still legally registered to her, and my other cousin who was living in her house rent free and a roofer by trade meth-head by lifestyle demand $5000 for fixing the roof...

They didn't even pay maintenance or taxes. They felt entitled and lashed out later when 'wronged', and your brother seems to feel entitled, too.", "Honestly OP, you need to organise these things before your mother deteriorates in future.

My family has experienced this multiple times, and I've seen it time and again with others, and it just keeps happening because people put it off. It's hard, upsetting, but necessary. It'll save sooo much frustration. Your mother could have a stroke or something else happen tomorrow. Being ready to act doesn't force you to act now, you can still wait to sell and put her in a home until it's necessary. GET AUTHORISATIONS NOW!", "By the time your mother can no longer make decisions for herself it will be too late to get a power of attorney.  Talk to a local lawyer, and explain to your mom that you're  making sure that you can make decisions in case she gets into an accident or is hospitalized.  You don't have to present it as \"in case you become demented\".", "Like another commenter said, you will need to help her with organizing this - such as tours of assisted living. You\u2019ll need to do it sooner than later before she deteriorates more. My family just did this with grandma and grandpa. Grandma has pretty bad caregiver burnout after caring for my grandpa who had a stroke in 1999, then started having more strokes and falls over the years. The conditions get worse and a lot more care does go in. Your mom will also be around more people around her age, there will be activities for her every day. Assisted living facilities usually will have a space for her to do any physical activities and she will have some sense of independence.", "Speaking as somebody with older family members who are further long in this part of life:  Do not leave that decision to her.\n\nDo the research.  Where can she go?  How long is the waiting list?  What does it take to get on it?  How much does it cost?  \n\nIs it time to get a reverse mortgage?\n\nWhere is your mom's important paperwork?  Do you have written authorization to deal with it?  To deal with her finances?  (And does your lazy-butt brother have access to any of it?)\n\nHas your mother had a cognitive test?  If she has them regularly, she can catch issues before they become so bad that she no longer realizes that she is slipping.\n\nETA:  If she falls and hits her head or is otherwise suddenly incapacitated, who has the notarized written authority to make decisions on her behalf?  Does she have a list of medical procedures she does not want used to revive her?  Now is the time for her to make one if not.\n\nWho does her taxes?\n\nHas she made a will?  Is it on file someplace not in the house?  Let her know that you don't want to know what's in it, you just need to know that it's been done and is kept somewhere save, like the county courthouse if that's a thing that the courthouse does in your jurisdiction.", "I know this is a bit redundant based on other comments but I have lots of personal experience with similar situations over the past 5 years with my mom and MIL who both past lasted year abs together seem to hit the highlights of your situation. \n\n1) Since you have siblings you need to make sure you are on the same page (and with your mom) for medical goals and how she wants to handle things for long term care and financially. Particularly if you think you might end up with your brother and you trying different things (like him trying to take the house, my aunt did that to my dad when my grandma died) it\u2019s important for one person to have financial POA and medical POA. In the US those are separate documents. In Washington state at least they only need to be signed by a notary but a lawyer might be better if you foresee family challenging decisions. Best to sort out POA before it\u2019s needed. \n\n2) Keep trying to have the discussion with your mom that she might need a level of care that you can\u2019t provide at home anymore. It doesn\u2019t have to be a skilled nursing facility right away depending on what she needs. Assisted living homes are good options and much cheaper. They\u2019re a good bridge when more help is needs but not daily medical care. For reference in 2020 I paid around $9k for a 6 person assisted living home for my mom vs $12k when she moved to a skilled nursing facility. It was run in a ADA set up home by my house where I was able to visit a couple of times a week. A lot of decisions to move to a high level of care ended up being forced instead of preplaned when my mom\u2019s medical condition took a sudden turn so one of my few regrets is not pushing her more to sit down an plan things. Instead I was left trying to figure things out when she wasn\u2019t always in a position to make a decision at that moment. \n\nSorry if this got a bit rambling. \n\nAlso keep and eye out for yourself and your family. Caregiver burnout is a thing that myself, my husband, BIL, and dad all have dealt with before. You need to take care of yourself to be able to help others. I\u2019m guessing feeling overwhelmed and burnt out is part of the push for getting your brother to step up? My husband mentioned feeling that way about his siblings with my MIL (I\u2019m an only child).", "She does recognize that these things need to be handled but hasn't wanted to act. I try not to push but I have explained that I don't care if she gives my brother her house, I just don't want to pay a lawyer and go through probate court to make that happen. I also told her she shouldn't give her house to him since she will probably need the equity in that house for her care if she gets worse.", "Yet.", "> I just want her to be motivated to take care of herself and get better. Her house is a mess but it is livable.\n\nThis sounds a little bit like denial.   A stroke changes your life.  Depending on what parts of the brain are affected, there may be permanent changes in thinking.  You can't motivate your way out of brain damage, and that's what a stroke is.\n\nIt's really, really hard, and figuring out what the right path is to keep her happy and healthy is difficult.  But the first step is admitting that she isn't happy and healthy, and she can't just will her way out of it.\n\nYou might check out r/agingparents , where we're all coping with the same worriess.", "ESH\n\nYou do know that once someone has had a stroke they are very likely to have another, or more?  And you realize the very real possibility of your mother\u2019s progressive decline in ability to care for her own activities of daily living?\n\nIs your mom currently receiving PT or OT or do you just hope she\u2019ll have to \u201cbe motivated to take care of herself\u201d and that will make her \u201cget better\u201d?\n\nRespite care comes in many formats, but out of all the options, dumping her on a brother who is very likely to neglect her care is really poor form.  That makes you just as culpable in the likely neglect that is soon to occur.  Please look into a better option than this immediately.", "Has she ever done any PT or OT? Speaking as a person who has witnessed her father go through an array of heart issues ranging from a widow maker to 2 cardiac arrests, I am wondering if your mother has ever had any rehabilitation services to help adjust to her new, post-stroke life. Inpatient rehab is amazing. Granted, it takes forever, and not all facilities are equal. You need to look for highly rated inpatient rehab programs that deal specifically with cardiac patients and have a bunch of equipment.", "OP, you need an elder care lawyer. Depending on your mother's financial situation, she may qualify for both Medicaid and Medicare, one of which would cover skilled nursing at home. At the very least, the lawyer can help y'all plan for when things decline. I'm not saying that'll be tomorrow, but maybe 10 - 50 years down the line.", "Very true. And I wonder if the house is being maintained if it\u2019s in that state. As someone who has to deal with a parent\u2019s house when they were t able to keep up with the maintenance and hid that fact it\u2019s very expensive and hard to come back from that.  (Spoiler: Didn\u2019t. Sold a house that had been in my family for 90 years to sell for my mom\u2019s long term care as my carpenter husband said it financially wasn\u2019t worth saving \ud83d\ude41.)", "Right...OP dropped his mother off in a place they describe with grease, cobwebs, and a pigsty with a person that doesn't want her \n\nI feel really sorry for your mother. And I say this as someone that took care of my mother and grandmother before they died.", "This, but the cost should come out the rent the brother needs to start paying.", "We gone through this already this year. It was like a forced situation because my grandma kept refusing and wanted to continue to take care of my grandfather in their own home. Dude couldn\u2019t really walk or get out of a chair himself. He\u2019s incontinent, his speech is forever slurred. He\u2019s had a few falls and she can\u2019t lift him. She had undiagnosed dementia at the time. The time he was admitted to the nursing home, he had a high fever and pneumonia; and she never caught that he was sick - that was back in April this year. His condition has now progressed to him transitioning to hospice. I wish she had listened that he needed to stay in the nursing home last year when he had a nasty fall. I wish she would\u2019ve listened sooner when she was advised she needed to move to assisted living. It has caused some problems and stress. My mom is now thinking about all of this stuff for herself because of how stressful this process has been.", "Absolutely correct. I have a friend who waited a little too long and now her husband can no longer sign his own name to make her his POA. It\u2019s causing her massive anxiety and attorney fees to try to get around this.", "I've brought all this up to my mom and she always says yes thats a good idea but I haven't pushed because I didn't want my brother to think I was trying to pull something. I will see how she feels about it when she comes back.", "I understand that concept. After her stroke and going through therapy she was doing really well. When she is practicing her speech we can understand her really well. I had her walking around the block. Went from several breaks to a walk with no stops. She just stopped. My GF is a Nurse that has worked in several Rehab centers. She has watched her and has seen her do things then later say she cant then watch her do them. Its hard to explain.", "She has been stable for awhile, when I say she is in decline its because she is not doing anything to counteract old age and her deficits from the stroke. We did both PT and OT but she refused to do the work because she was \"tired\". We tried diet and exercise but she has no interest. My brother is an annoying prick who will be on her everyday because he has nothing better to do than to boss other people around. I am hoping that will \"help\" her.", "So go along with the irresponsible brother and enable to live in moms house rent free so OP and his fam get zero breaks and get burnt out? Trust me, grandma loves both sons and prob is more worried about the loser in her house and is glad she gets to spend some time with him. Believe me when your old you don\u2019t want to be a burden to anyone so it\u2019s good she goes to her home and back to her other sons", "It\u2019s not fair for your niece to have her grandmother dumped on her.", "Conservatorship or Guardianship are the routes when POA is not possible. It's way more difficult, since the person has to be deemed incompetent by a judge.", "OP. She may push it off until she can't make the decision, or any decision for herself anymore. You can either start the process while she understands what's going on, or you may be looking at waiting on your brother to contribute to any decisions made on her behalf if no POA is established. She has to understand that any guilt that she might feel for displacing your brother will be a moot point because she would like what happens between the two of her sons even less. If it's stressful now, it will put a permanent wedge between you and put the two of you out even more.\n\nThis is absolutely the hardest thing for any family to go through so it's obviously not as simple as saying \"hey lol let's do this it'll be great!\" It's extremely emotionally charged and it jumpstarts feelings of grief in everyone involved, and you will all handle it in different ways. I don't envy you and am not saying this as though it is cut and dry. When I was 16, my grandpa died of cancer. My grandma was on a bit of a decline at the time, so each of the children rotated staying in the house in shifts until he took his last breath. She couldn't imagine putting him in care of any kind because she had always taken care of him(!!!), so they all did it on top of their individual family care, full time jobs, etc. That was the last day my grandma was able to take charge of ANYTHING. The rotating schedule continued in full force for ten more excruciating years because my grandma's dementia quickly became round the clock supervision and she lived for another decade.\n\nNot one of those kids speak to each other anymore. None of them wanted to upset her while she was losing her husband and it never felt like a good time to discuss what to do when things got bad. Then, NONE of them could agree on what to do, and each were affected in a different way by what they did under the assumption she wanted the same thing my grandpa did. I don't for one second believe that either grandparent would be okay knowing that the siblings hated each other because of now traumatizing her care became. Your brother is an AH but I imagine there's part of you that loves him too. He will be who you have left when your mother isn't here anymore.\n\nTake care of yourself. My heart goes out to you, truly.\n\nETA: Weird typo/autocorrect", "What do her doctors currently say about her prognosis? Because to be honest, if it has been a few years since her stroke, it's very possible that there isn't much she can do to continue \"recovering.\" She can maintain skills and reduce risk of further illness or injury but she might not be able to return to the same level of function as she had before her stroke. The earlier intervention occurs the better, and if she didn't really participate then, this is likely her new baseline of \"normal.\"", ">My brother is an annoying prick who will be on her everyday because he has nothing better to do than to boss other people around. I am hoping that will \"help\" her.\n\nno, your brother is a selfish prick who can't be assed to help anyone other than himself. he refused to clean his house for his daughter, his mother, and himself.\n\nit sounds more likely he's going to harass and verbally abuse your mom for existing in \"his\" space or straight up ignore her needs.", "We went through this with my dad after his stroke. He would refuse to do any kind of PT/OT.  He had a hard time getting around the house as time went on and this placed a huge burden on my mom.  We finally sold their house and had them move to assisted living even though he didn\u2019t want to because it was the safest option for both of them.  I really do not think she will get better at this point. PT/OT could certainly help her maintain but it has nothing to do with lack of motivation.  Her brain is not working the way it used to.  What seems logical to you just doesn\u2019t for stroke victims.  Having her live in someplace gross with her son bullying her will not get the outcome you want.\n\nI totally get that you need a break, but please look into selling her house and finding an assisted living facility for her.", "You are not being realistic about the situation and neither is your mother. The more you comment the worse your mother's situation sounds.", "You did the right thing. Its good for your mom and your brother to spend time together. If you do it all you are just helping her enable your brother.", "It\u2019s not fair on OP to give up their whole life while their brother stays in her house for free either. It\u2019s time someone else takes responsibility or the brother gets kicked out. Mom can\u2019t continue enabling the brother because she has a \u2018big heart\u2019 but continue being a burden to OP.

For a house she hasn't been living in? And the occupants weren't paying for shelter?\n\nWow.", "You make a good point. I didn't consider the abusive part. So far I've called her each day to check on her and will continue to do so. If she is having issues with him I will go and pick her up.", "Assisted living too. I have a resident that does most of her own care when she's alone, but as soon as you go in to check her, shes absolutely pitiful. Can't even move a pillow by herself! Can't get her blanket six inches away! Mind you, she's blind so we snuck in with her daughter and have seen first hand she is capable, just unwilling", "I'd think long and hard if she will mention having issues or not - I assume she has some awareness why she's there for awhile. And think about sneaky ways of checking in on that in case she's minimising any issues. \n\nI'm with other people thinking this is a poor solution to a real problem. You can't force people to give a shit. I'd definitely look into POA if you don't have it yet so you can manage her accounts as there is a chance that your brother will try and milk her for money for the 'inconvenience'. If not the brother, will she be protected from scammers? \n\nNiece checking up on her I think does mean if stuff starts kicking off it won't get that bad. But things could kick off.", "She's moving back to her house that her other son is freeloading in.  The better option would be to sell it and pay for care.", "You said you want her to go back and forth every two months. Did you mean you actually just wanted her to go there for two months, like a one time thing?", "It\u2019s inevitable isn\u2019t it?", "No, our idea was that she can stay there for 2 months then come back here for 2 months then go back there so on and so on until she decides that she does want to go back and forth or she cant. My niece is going to have a baby soon so it kinda worked out that she can spend time with her great grand daughter."]}
