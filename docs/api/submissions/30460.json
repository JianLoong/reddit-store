If he refuses then maybe it\u2019s time to kick him out and sell the house to help pay for her care.", "I don't really care about your brother right now, is your mom going to be okay living there!? Like, are her needs going to be met?", "ESH get POA over your mother, sell her home & use the money to get her into an assisted living so someone responsible can care for her.", "INFO:  Seems like people are imagining someone sitting helplessly in a wheelchair in a cobwebby corner of the room, neglected.  But that's not what I get from \"basically self sufficient\" but \"cannot drive\".  What was your mother's participation in this decision to stay with your brother for a couple of months?   The state of the house doesn't sound ideal, but do you have any reason to suspect that she won't be looked after?  Is hiring a part-time housekeeper and/or companion  (possibly at your brother's expense if he's living there for free) an option?", "I debated between NTA and ESH, landing on a soft ESH. The real SH in this situation is your brother, especially since he's living in your mom's house (rent free, right?) and not wanting to help with her at all. He may say he wants to help but actions speak louder than words and his actions are screaming that he doesn't want to help. I understand you need a break, I've been watching my dad have to deal with a similar situation with his FIL for years now. But I landed on ESH because, given your brother's actions and the state of the house, are you really sure your mother is going to be appropriately taken care of there? Is a good assisted living home financially out of the question? That sounds like it might be a healthier, safer environment for her than with your brother.", "NTA: and he never wants you to come back? Oh no!", "YTA. But only because it's CLEARLY not safe or healthy for your mother to remain in that house. Your brother has not kept it up, and clearly has hoarder -like tendencies. \n\nIt may be time to consider a long-term plan for your mother-  like moving her into a retirement community and paying for it by selling her house.", "It sounds like she wants to stay in her home and can do so at this point. Can you hire a maid and a caregiver that comes by daily and can make sure she exercises, takes meds. Etc?", "Sounds like she should sell her house and move to an assisted living facility.", "NTA - Sounds like you need a break and it\u2019s been overwhelming being her carer. If she still has full capacity - she\u2019s an adult and can determine where she lives/how she lives. Regular checks and a mental break for you may make it easier for you to assess the situation with fresh eyes.", "You need to sell your mom\u2019s house and move her into independent living or assisted living. I can tell you that she will love it. Many facilities have three meals a day and plenty of group activities. My BIL didn\u2019t want to move but he now says he is so happy. While mom is with brother you can look at different home near you. .", "It might do your brother good to have his landlord living in her home that he\u2019s destroying.  Your brother is AH for being a leech and not caring more for his mom that lets him live rent free.  I hope you and gf get a nice break. Caregiving takes a lot. I\u2019m sure if things aren\u2019t good, your mom will let you know.", "NTA\n\nYour mom went home....end of story.\n\nHe needs to get his act together.", "Your poor mom. I know it's hard to be the responsible one, but do you honestly think your brother is going to step up and care for your mom . Or leave her in her room to vegetate with minimal care?

I made sure of that. I brought the things she uses like her shower chair as I knew my brother wouldn't have one. My niece also stated that she would be going over frequently to check on her and if things got \"bad\" she would let me know. Unlike my brother I call my mom and check on her as well. I told her if she needs to come back sooner we can do that.", "That might be the plan moving forward but I am leaving that decision to her. Its her house, her decision.", "No she isn't confined to a chair unless she is looking at facebook or youtube. She runs on cereal and PB&J and relies on someone for anything else. My mom was involved in the decision to go back down there for a change of pace and the food. When I brought up the idea she got very excited. I wouldn't have considered having her there if my niece wasn't available to help. I did tell her we need to look into a maid service that can deep clean each room and we can do a room at a time at my brothers expense and to look for a handy man. If I was closer I would do it myself.", "I don't want to put her in a home. I have a room. I just want her to be motivated to take care of herself and get better. Her house is a mess but it is livable. While she may not be comfortable she will be fine. She also very much wanted to go down to her house. As we were driving down her street she said \"This feels like home\".\n\nIf anything else she will get the inspiration to get better or to finally sell her house that her other son is destroying.", "Its habitable just not as nice as my house. My GF and I feel that she has become to comfortable. She does not do her speech therapy, she doesn't do her exercises she just sits in her room and watches TV all day. My intention was to show her that it is better here so that way she would be somewhat motivated. Currently as it sits it feels like she is just waiting to pass on and I am trying to change that", "Caregivers were covered for the 1st year now it would be out of pocket. She is good about taking her pills and I do plan on trying to figure out a maid and handy man for her.", "She does not want to sell her house at least right now. Maybe after seeing how bad her house has been cared for that might change. My mom prefers to be alone, I have tried everything to entice her out to participate in family gatherings, parties, outings and she prefers to sit in her room and watch NCIS. While my brother is an asshole he might be able to annoy her enough to get her moving around and talking and doing the things she should be doing. I am man enough to admit that I failed in keeping on her. It feels like she needs someone in her face all day to get her to do the things she needs to do. I just don't have the energy anymore. I am hoping my brother can do what I can't.", "My mom wont go to a home unless I am unable to physically take care of her.  There are many reasons for this move, most of which is motivation. But the plan is to have her come back in 2 months.", "It's the mom's home. Brother can get dropped on the curb if he doesn't like it.", "Irrelevant: it's the mom's house.", "Start looking for respite programs. These are not the same as PSW\u2019s.  These people are trained in whatever disorder they are providing care for but they are there so you can get a break. I used to do respite and the people were so glad to get 8 hrs or 24hrs breaks.", "That's... not exactly what I meant. Shower chair is great, but you left her with someone who's already not taking care of where he lives. How can you be sure he's going to drive her where she needs to go or take care of the house well enough for her to safely live there?", "Maybe hire a monthly cleaner who cleans nce a month or once a week.", "You need to find some places she can tour. Without touring she can\u2019t make an informed decision.", "Well seems totally reasonable to me, except for your brother feeling a bit put out seems like a win all around; you guys get a break, your mom gets a change, your niece gets to spend time with her grandma, and probably your brother gets a cleaner house.  And I expect he will step up at least somewhat when she is right in front of him.   It's not like she can't state her own needs.  Excellent.", "OP I totally understand your frustration.  My dad had a stroke and did not recover as well as he could have. If it was easier to get someone to do something for him rather than try to do it himself he would always prefer that. We begged him to exercise. He always claimed he did, but no one ever saw him.", "You wanted to show her it was better in your brother\u2019s unkept house with cobwebs and dog hair and computer components all over the floor? Living with a \u2018stubborn asshole\u2019? Sure makes sense.", "So you have consulted her doctor? Physical therapists?  You may be right that she could make more of an effort, I'm just asking if you have a long-term plan in place.  We all age and we all get to a point where we can no longer take care of ourselves.", "He can't keep a house. You expect him to be motivated to help his mother? More likely he will let her eat PBJ and cereal as long as he gets to do what he wants. Why would he care if she doesn't leave the room? I hope I am wrong.", "Just re read and totally missed that part. \n\nNta, he's a huge ah.", "My niece is available and was part of the decision to have her go down there. She will have help and someone that can let me know if it becomes dangerous for her to be there.", "BTW at least where I live physios will come to you (paid for various different ways depending on the situation).  Or, they will come and teach the exercises to a family member or a hired companion so that person can help the affected person.", "This is literally my mom lol. She will lie right to your face that she did something when she didn't. When Covid hit I was able to work from home so I was there when she had physical therapy I would get on her everyday. It was a constant thing I had to do. Once I went back to the office it seems she doesn't do much. There are a lot of things that I could do to prepare for her future but I know I would break her spirit if I did. I am just hoping my brother as annoying as he is can annoy some motivation out of her.", "No, I wanted to show her that she has three options. My brothers way of life, mine or a home. I have been doing everything for her these last 4 years and I think she has gotten complacent. She says she wants to get better, start driving again and doing the things she loves, but I feel my house is far to comfortable for her. She can sit back and relax and not have to take care of herself. If she has to struggle just a little maybe that will force her to do some rehab.\n\nNot sure if I am making any sense with that", "My mom was a VET so their care isn't the greatest but an advantage of having her at her house is she is 20 minutes from a Military hospital that can give her a much needed checkup. Almost none of the Doctors in my area (that are respectable) take Tri-care.", "He is very fond of telling other people what to do, not so much doing it on his own.", "We did that for almost a year, insurance wont pay for anymore. If she didn't have a house payment I could get that covered with her social security.", "I hope so too. There is a saying at hospitals and nursing homes about how amazing it is about some of the things some patients are capable of doing for themselves when they are alone in a room vs. when someone is with them.", "Well I\u2019m trying to understand. You\u2019re saying she has three options. Your house, a home or bro. But you took her out of your house and to bro. So it sounds like she has two options not three. Or maybe more accurately, you just don\u2019t want her in your house 100% of the time (COMPLETELY understandable). \n\nI\u2019m in the weird situation of needing to move my dad to assisted living and at the same time might need to do the same for myself due to chronic illness. It\u2019s hard to admit when you need a higher level of care, but it seems quite clear she\u2019s there. If I were you I\u2019d be pushing that and looking at options because it seems the inevitable outcome. Even if your brother stepped up, which we both know he won\u2019t, it\u2019s temporary and she\u2019ll wind up in a home anyway unless you can manage higher and higher levels of care in your home.", "Well, you seem to know that your brother is all talk,no show.", "My idea was to have her go back and forth between my brother and I every 2 months until she either doesn't want to go or needs a higher level of care. She basically did this with her mother when she was diagnosed with Dementia. I just wanted to take a break but also give her a chance to see what her other option is while also motivating her to get better.", "Ok, so the two options are 50/50 w brother or a home. Have you made this plan clear to her, repeatedly (given she may have some limitations or denial going on)? \n\nIt sounds like your brother doesn\u2019t want her in his home, so is this even a sustainable plan that he agreed to? \n\nSure seems to me like your only long term options are you 100% or a home. \n\nIt\u2019s ok if you do not want to be an option. This is a situation many of us face when parents start to decline. There\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of if you don\u2019t want to have her with you 100%. I wouldn\u2019t be capable or willing of taking in either parent. But you would be a good daughter to ensure she has a comfortable, safe clean environment to live in. And I\u2019m sure that\u2019s your goal already.", "Something has been lost in translation. My mom is still going to live with me until I can't physically care for her (as in she needs 24 hour care). This is just a temp situation to give myself and my woman a break and to recharge her batteries so to speak. I'm hoping in a couple months she comes back with a new purpose. Don't just exist."]}
