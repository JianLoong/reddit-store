I did all the laundry immediately, verified that the items were clean as they came out of the load, and because I had to leave before the mattress protector came out of the dryer (verified spotless, but still needed to be dried), I texted them both that my period had chosen violence that morning and their mattress cover was in the dryer.

If I remember correctly, you\u2019re not allowed to use tampons (especially Ultras) for a few weeks.  I discovered the Always disposable period panties a while back and they\u2019re lifesavers if you\u2019re not familiar.  They absorb 5 pads worth, move around with you as you toss and turn, and can be tossed in the garbage or the Diaper Genie if your husband insists in the morning.
