Is she going to let him buy new ones every new *anything* gets on them?", "Absolutely this \u261d\ufe0f", "Jesus, OP. \n\nLike\u2026I\u2019m speechless.", "One day this won\u2019t be funny.  You\u2019re going to resent him terribly when he abandons you or one of your children in a time of extreme need. \n\nIt isn\u2019t actually funny now.  It\u2019s gone far enough.  You can live your life with his feelings always being the biggest and most important but one day that won\u2019t work anymore.", "Yeah or if someone has anything serious. My husband and I have cleaned each others wounds and dressings. We've stayed at bedsides in hospital. And we've helped each other recover from various ailments and operations. We've cleaned up after each other after different gross and unfortunate illnesses. That's just life.\n\nPeriod blood?? Fuck that wouldn't even begin to make the list.", "\u2026 so how does he handle his own \u201cstuff\u201d then? Please don\u2019t answer that but he needs a come to Jesus talk about expectations and learning coping techniques.

Absolutely insanity!!!", "I get hot flashes at three am every night. I call it my witching hour.", "Because it benefits him", "EDIT: I've just read through some of OPs comments and honestly OP it does sound like your husband has some form of OCD, or OCD-adjacent, relating specifically to bodily fluids. He should be seeking support to work through it, not getting insulted by strangers on reddit. If everyone could stop equating OP's husband's genuine mental health problem with their shitty ex's dislike of periods, that would be great.\n\nOn the face of it NTA, but if your husband is a) willing to acknowledge he's not being rational and b) willing to pay for and purchase new sheets, then NAH and I think you should let him throw the blood stained ones away.\n\nI'm very squicky about dead bugs. If a spider died on my sheets, washing them 100 times would not be enough to make me feel comfortable using them again, because even though rationally I'd know they were clean, in my head I wouldn't be able to stop thinking about the dead spider. If your husband feels similarly about blood, I think he should be allowed to replace the sheets for his own peace of mind and sleep quality.", "100% it\u2019s not like OP bled all over the mattress. She cleaned it up as soon as she was able\u2026if he thinks that the bedding needs to be replaced he should replace it out of HIS paycheck/savings it\u2019s not normal to throw out bedding every time something like this happens.\n\nOP NTA", "I agree NTA but it\u2019s not bad to be grossed out by the blood itself. It *is* gross. What\u2019s not gross, is the fact women have periods. That\u2019s natural and shouldn\u2019t be shamed or anything. But it\u2019s not wrong to be grossed out from the blood itself", "Or when that baby is constipated and you have to pretty much work that stuff out and pull it out", "We don't find him to be squeamish, we find him to be ridiculous and insulting.\n\nHe sounds unreasonably selfish.", "Is he a good husband overall?", "just a tip: i\u2019ve noticed with my kids that the way to prevent blow outs, go up a size. when they start having blow outs again, that tells you to move up to the next size. it\u2019s been working wonders for us and my kids (16 months and 1 month) rarely have blow outs. \n\nalso make sure to fluff out the sides too!", "Pew pew.

My first son fingerpainted his nursery with poop from his diaper.  I was relieved that he was playing so well by himself because I was busy getting the guest room ready for my MIL.  I've since learned to be suspicious when a young child is too quiet for too long.", "This post made me laugh until I cried.  I have three kids and a dog and I thought I had seen it all, but you win.", "This also works well for perimenopausal night sweats.", "This is my question.", "I think so - he does take care of our child and change dirty diapers/clean spit up.

I do love him.", "I've definitely threatened him with milk missles.", "He actually doesn't. \ud83d\ude02", "I don\u2019t agree with that of course which is why I voted NTA. I just don\u2019t think being grossed out by menstrual blood is a bad thing", "Because entertaining whatever this is - a phobia, mental illness, whatever - is not the way to make the situation better. It's an unreasonable way to address the issue when it's *literally* an unavoidable situation.", "I teach 2-3 year olds. I can totally see this happening! Thanks for the laugh but sorry for the crime scene.", "I know you love him. It\u2019s possible to love even toxic people, and people who don\u2019t show up for you. Love is free and unconditional. Adult romantic relationships are not. They require mutual reciprocity, trust, open communication, kindness, compromise? Are you satisfied with him as a husband overall. Can you rely on him. Does he respect and value you.", "Oh my\u2026 Do they have to throw them away though lol?", ":(\n\nI had concerns this may be the case. \n\nMy little giggle is ruined :( \ud83d\ude02", "Replacing blood stained sheets for an individual who\u2019s particularly grossed out is an unreasonable suggestion?

Low estrogen can result in problems with urine leakage that have nothing to do with your pelvic floor or childbirth and everything to do with vaginal area shrinkage! You can get topical cream to insert but it sometimes only reduces the problem.", "I had this same issue (29 days was my longest period at one point), and there were days I couldn\u2019t leave the house it was so heavy. The only thing that helped was having an ablation. The gynecologist suggested it since I was developing anemia. It was a sim outpatient procedure, and the following few months had unbelievably light periods for 2-3 days, then none. It\u2019s one of the best decisions I\u2019ve ever made.", "I don't know about you but if the stain doesn't come out I'm buying new ones because I'm not sleeping on dried blood.\n\nNo discredit yeah I'd keep them if they are clean", "You would be suprised how many men have this same reaction. It stems from parents glossing over or hiding the truth about female body fuctions. Ex family members of mine would get very upset if a pad in the trash bin wasnt rolled in enought toilet paper or came undone from the roll and they saw it.", "As someone who has an actual medical phobia,  I understand your frustration and sympathize with your husband. \n\nThe problem is that no matter how much I understand intellectually and rationally that my triggers are not actually harmful,  and that I could just tough it out and be fine in ten seconds,  the responses that I have are completely involuntary. I quite literally lose control of my body when faced with my triggers.  \n\nYour husband needs therapy for this,  if it's something he genuinely can't control. It's funny,  it's sad,  it's frustrating,  and it's maybe treatable.", "When my kids were younger they had monthly nosebleeds during allergy season. Blood was everywhere, dripping through their hands, on their bed and clothes, droplets down the stairs as they made their way to get to our room, then usually drops next to the the toilet or sink\u2026 quite a mess to clean up. When I had several kids under 10, that was like 3 nosebleeds a month. I don\u2019t think this husband would be up for that level of parenting.", "One time my daughter stood at the top of the stairs to tell me her tummy felt funny and when she opened her mouth she projectile vomited down the flight of carpeted stairs.  It was on every stair, the landing, and both walls the whole way down. My husband worked overnights at the time so I was by myself at midnight trying to use the little portable shampooer on our steep staircase. Just an absolute nightmare. I took many photos to send to my husband because I knew there was no way he or anyone would ever believe how bad it truly was. \n\nAnyway! Good luck to OPs husband!", "Truly. If it isn\u2019t leaking from your period to leaking when you sneeze, cough or blink later in life. \n\nWhile I can understand tossing sheets if they are hopelessly stained just skipping straight to trashing them without washing first is just a waste of money. \n\nNTA", "Found OP\u2019s husband", "Lmao.

I educate myself on the male body, health issues etc. too.", "It dosent hurt to educate them. I had to do it to my husband. If ya love someone, then ya try to work threw it with them instead of throwing it all out. Saying \"they can educate themselves\" is very ignorant. Like a person who has missinformation of the subject will never relize it untill corrected and shown diferently. They will never know were to start learning unless shown were to start. They may not be comfortable about it at all and wish to speak to someone educated on the matter to feel more comfortable about it. Saying \"they need to educate themselves\" shows a lack of understanding and care on your part. How many divorces are ya going to go threw dude to this when it could have been cleared up by just helping them learn?", "It hurts me time wise to educate men. Wouldn't get married to one like that. People can google anything these days. Even job to fact check. It's not that hard to educate yourself.", "Google \"mental illness flag\". Then come back and say google is great. Sorry but just cuz ya can google things dosent mean its a great place to learn things. Its how people misdiagnose health issues or think that google is better then a doctor. \n\nLook its up to you wether ya want to or not. Ya cant be upset at a misinformed person when your so self entitled you cant spare  minute to set someone on a better educational path.
