Finances do not need to be handled all day every day and night. A partner who won\u2019t handle body fluids can\u2019t ever be left alone with a baby or young child, as they will emit body fluids. \n\nThe argument you appear to be making is that being a primary wage earner excuses a partner from ever changing a diaper.

The way that the OP frames this situation, suggests that this particular bleeding incident was unusually excessive by her own standards. \n\nIn other words, if he were squeamish at the first sign of blood, then he would be throwing sheets away every month.", "Yes it is. You attributed words to me that I didn\u2019t say.

You\u2019re projecting.", "How is it specious? Your claim was that one person can\u2019t do 100% of a single task. And I easily did proved it. Now you\u2019re trying to undermine my argument rather than providing an actually rebuttal. It is you who is not arguing a good faith.", "I never said it was.", "Maybe. Baby clothes are cheap.
