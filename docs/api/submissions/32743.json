She was a drunk woman trying to get home late at night. If you think she didn\u2019t make a responsible decision, that\u2019s a discussion to have the next day, but making her walk home in that state put her in a very dangerous position. \n\nAlso, if your gf would get mad that you gave a friend a ride home when she was drunk late at night, she\u2019s also a major AH. Are you even sure this is the case? I\u2019ve never met a woman who would want another woman to walk home in the condition? I really feel like you didn\u2019t want to give your friend a ride, and you\u2019re using your gf as a cover.\n\nEdit: Goddamn look at the responses. So many along the line of \u201cNot my responsibility, not my problem\u201d. This is how you people treat a friend? Do you people know the definition of compassion? Selflessness? So glad I didn\u2019t have friends like these back in college. Friends always look out for one another, especially when one of them is in a vulnerable state.", "Why would your gf have issues with you driving a friend to the tube? Is she that insecure or are you that paranoid? Ultimately it is your choice whether to drive someone or not, but your reasoning speaks to bigger issues.", "YTA-dropping her off was on your way.  You left a tipsy friend to figure things out on their own.  A lot more could have happened than merely her purse being stolen.  I realize she could have made better choices and not gotten tipsy but the least you could have done was drop her off at the tube station or even call her a cab.  If you were concerned about what your girlfriend would think you could have called her or even had her on speaker while driving. I know- everyone (myself included) makes poor choices sometimes. The good that comes from this is it\u2019s made you wonder about some choices and maybe make different choices next time.", "YTA. Who needs enemies when they have friends like these, right? \n\nJokes aside, you could have dropped her off at the station with minimal trouble for yourself (your own words). You call her your friend, but you don't act like one. It'd be different is you didn't know her or she was someone you know passingly, or the station was out of your way. \n\nSo imo, although you didn't *have to* drop her off, not doing so does make you TA in this case.

I think this would hold true even if she got home without incident, it\u2019s just magnified because there was one. And she didn\u2019t show up to a party without a plan to get home, clearly she could and did take public transportation. So no, OP was not obligated to help or responsible for the outcome.

If your relationship isn\u2019t strong enough to withstand you dropping a friend off that\u2019s not a very healthy relationship.

Your friend getting Tipsy, drunk or otherwise inebriated when they had a responsibility of walking home through public spaces also is not your fault you knew you needed to drive home and remained sober, it would be the same kind of thing for your friend, that being said, had you recognized any of the above signs and carried on anyway for any of the mentioned reasons would possibly stand to make you an AH but it\u2019s not necessarily automatic but I\u2019m sure there are plenty of people who may disagree so good luck.", "NTA.

I thought it was so sweet. Do you know where that guy is right now? In prison. For rape. So don't act like wanting to walk women home is the pillar of moral virtue for men. Something to be expected.
