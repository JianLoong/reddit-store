Sounds like sister lost both baby AND husband in the accident, and you skipped the funeral due to a dress fitting. I can't imagine going through what your sister went through. Her whole life collapsed. When people suffer that kind of trauma, the rest of us need to be gentle and understanding. Now, that doesn't mean you can't post any pictures ever, but it's not hard to post it to \"all but sister\" on FB. It's an easy, basic courtesy to make it where it won't pop up in her feed.

Her sister had her entire family taken away from her. OP conveniently didn't mention this in the post.\n\nAlso you might notice the part about issues with BIL's funeral. She replied with this info:\n\n*I had a dress fitting and had to go to the venue to sort something out after, so we didn't attend the funeral. She was mad at me about that.  And I'm not calling myself a saint. I just don't think posting pictures is that big of a deal, but I get she's hurt so I made this post*\n\nShe didn't attend the funeral because she had a dress fitting and had to sort something out at the venue. She says \"we\", not \"I\" so I assume the fiance (now husband) didn't attend the funeral either. OP didn't feel the take to take even a little bit of time to support her sister and attend the funeral.\n\n*I absolutely get that her grief is a lot, which  is why I never pushed her to do anything. She didn't attend my wedding. Didn't attend my baby shower. When I tried to talk to her about my wedding, baby she never listened so I never made her. I would've liked her to be with me but she chose not to, which is fine.

I don't want to have to restrict all my posts, double check all the photos I post all to satisfy one person*\n\nSomeone else commented that OP should restrict her baby posts so the sister can't see them. OP's reply is that she doesn't want to go into the trouble of restricting her photos to \"satisfy one person\".\n\nHonestly, it seems to me OP hasn't been supportive of her sister at all. The baby shower posts are just the icing on the cake. Why didn't she unfollow or restrict the sister even after knowing the reaction to her wedding photos? Because she doesn't want to have to *restrict all my posts, double check all the photos I post to satisfy one person*.
