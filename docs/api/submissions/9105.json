Her whole life collapsed. When people suffer that kind of trauma, the rest of us need to be gentle and understanding.

OP's reply is that she doesn't want to go into the trouble of restricting her photos to \"satisfy one person\".\n\nHonestly, it seems to me OP hasn't been supportive of her sister at all.

That relationship is broken for now. So focus on your child\u2019s well-being which is what\u2019s at stake now, if you truly love your child, you MUST seek therapy. \n\nGrow. Work on empathy. If you can, also volunteer, which is a wonderful way to develop empathy while helping others.

It\u2019s a world view shattering moment that is hard to grasp. But consider the pouring amount of comments from strangers pointing out your misconduct, consider your mother\u2019s stance, something is off and you made a mistake. Accountability is the only way forward. Now it\u2019s up to you to decide if moving forward you want to be a better, kinder person, and will be proactive to become that, or do you prefer to be blind, and refuse to grow and mature at the cost of the happiness of your loved ones.\n\nI hope you pick change and growth.", "Wow who needs enemies when she had a sister like you!!
