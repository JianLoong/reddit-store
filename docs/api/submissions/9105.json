Her whole life collapsed. When people suffer that kind of trauma, the rest of us need to be gentle and understanding. Now, that doesn't mean you can't post any pictures ever, but it's not hard to post it to \"all but sister\" on FB. It's an easy, basic courtesy to make it where it won't pop up in her feed.

And I'm not calling myself a saint. I just don't think posting pictures is that big of a deal, but I get she's hurt so I made this post*\n\nShe didn't attend the funeral because she had a dress fitting and had to sort something out at the venue. She says \"we\", not \"I\" so I assume the fiance (now husband) didn't attend the funeral either. OP didn't feel the take to take even a little bit of time to support her sister and attend the funeral.\n\n*I absolutely get that her grief is a lot, which  is why I never pushed her to do anything.

I don't want to have to restrict all my posts, double check all the photos I post all to satisfy one person*\n\nSomeone else commented that OP should restrict her baby posts so the sister can't see them. OP's reply is that she doesn't want to go into the trouble of restricting her photos to \"satisfy one person\".\n\nHonestly, it seems to me OP hasn't been supportive of her sister at all. The baby shower posts are just the icing on the cake. Why didn't she unfollow or restrict the sister even after knowing the reaction to her wedding photos?

Wow", "You skipped your BIL funeral for a DRESS FITTING! This is disgusting.  You proclaimed to everyone that a dress fitting was a higher priority than your sister.  I can't believe your sister or any of your family even speak to you after this stunt.  You should be ashamed of yourself.  Are extremely self centered people ever ashamed of their actions? You should think on that.  YTA", "Reddit is a den for disgusting comments but this is truly on another level. You are a monster, and that\u2019s not an insult. It\u2019s just a fact.", "Your lack of empathy is like... pathological almost. Have you always hated your sister? YTA.", "YTA and you know it, that is the reason you didn\u2019t mention this in the post. Shame on you.", "There\u2019s no way you woke up this morning and thought for a second that you were anything but an asshole.", "Not wishing death on your husband but if the roles where reversed you would be mad too if your husband died and child died and your sister didn\u2019t show up to the funeral you would just be ok with that? Smile and act like everything is ok. You need some help. Obviously you don\u2019t get she\u2019s hurt because you\u2019re all like my life shouldn\u2019t stop. Have you even been there to support her in anyway because you\u2019re posting like she\u2019s an inconvenience to you.", "YTA. \n\nYou have to know that you are an awful and horrible human being? How can you think your sister is in wrong in this? How you cannot go to BILs funeral? How you cannot support your sister?\n\n// I forgot to put the judgement as OPs comment just made me so mad.", "You skipped her husbands funeral? FOR A DRESS FITTING?! Youre worse than an AH. I cant say what you are or ill get banned. Monster and selfish and jesus\u2026", "[removed]", "What is wrong with you? You skipped your BIL\u2019s funeral for a damn dress fitting. Your complete lack of empathy is staggering", "I bet she would have liked you to be with her at the funeral\u2026", "Wow. It's real big of you to not make her listen to your wedding and baby talk. How empathetic of you. /s\n\nWhen did you try to talk to her about her husband? About her baby? When did you sit with her for hours saying nothing so that she knows without a doubt you're there for her? When did you show up with food because you realize she might be having trouble eating? When did you offer to stay the night so the house wouldn't feel so empty?\n\nNot forcing her to not talk about your stuff doesn't count for much. You would have liked her to be with *you*? Try imagining how she feels?\n\nI have the feeling you can't.", "Yeah, I'm sure she would've like you to be with her at HER HUSBAND'S FUNERAL, but you know, dress fittings are obviously more important/s.", "You are YTA people like you are sickening.", "I know right lol", "Right!!!! Fucking a you are seriously a horrible human.", "What was the point of any of this?Seems like you posted half truths to strangers so you\u2019d feel better about the fact that you exposed yourself to your entire family as incredibly insensitive, callous and selfish?", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

OP is someone who shouldn\u2019t even be in the gene pool and breeding. She is either a complete psycho or an absolute moron. Either way that kid is screwed.", "I think OP lacks so much empathy that she would never be able to see her sister's side. Absolutely heartless."]}
