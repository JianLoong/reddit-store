I moved out a week after telling him because I knew that he would try to talk me out of leaving for his own selfish reasons knowing that we were struggling month to month. My goal wasn\u2019t to hurt him, I just wanted to make sure we could have more income since I was the main breadwinner with a actual stable income paying for rent, car payments, his loan, and my own expenses which left me with almost nothing. On top of that he crash our car which was his only was of making money and I still had to pay $500 a month for a car that sat in out parking lot collecting dust which hurt me a lot. Since he had no way of making money anymore he mostly sat and played video games all day long without ever looking for a real job because he didn\u2019t want to be \u201ctied to someone else\u2019s schedule\u201d. After I left I told him that I would pay his rent which I shouldn\u2019t have because paying for both my rent/utilities and his rent/utilities on top of other expenses has taken a toll on me and affected my performance at my job which is likely going to end up with me having to find another. I kept him updated on all of this. I\u2019ve been gone for 2 months and he has done virtually nothing to make even the smallest amount of money to keep a roof over his head. He put in a few applications and only got rejections, and I tried giving him advice on improving his resume but he\u2019s too stubborn to listen to me. He stopped because he \u201cdoesn\u2019t take rejection well\u201d. I had take a long break from work because I\u2019m having a lot of mental health issues from the stress of not just mine but his financial issues baring down on me.
