You handled that just right. He didn't want your answer. He wanted affirmation. You aren't his psychologist (which he seems like he may need to process this). He shouldn't push you like that even when he's hurting.\n\nBut instead of getting mad and becoming hurtful, you kept cool and neutralized the situation without pandering. And you stayed true to your own feelings without pushing them on your brother.\n\nGood job!", "NTA. He didn't want honesty, he wanted confirmation. He put you in a no-win situation and set you up to be the bad guy no matter what you said. You have been supportive all this time and kept your opinion to yourself because you love him. For what it's worth, I agree with you; people who want children but won't consider anything other than genetic shouldn't have them at all because they're too selfish to love and care for them as they should. There's a difference between wanting to be a parent and wanting children.", "NTA going towards N.A.H.\n\nTelling your true honest opinion wouldn't have helped at that moment. It would have probably just hurt your brother and damaged your relationship, especially if he has a history of getting upset after he's pushed you and told him what you honestly think.\n\nMaybe he does want someone to say to him they might want to reconsider all the fertility treatmen. Maybe he is thinking it, feels guilty and wants permission or external validation that it's ok. But that was not the time to have that discussion.", "I\u2019m confused at what you were suppose to say and do? I think your answer was fine.", "NAH. Is it possible the answer he was searching for was \"permission\" to give up?", "You can\u2019t win for losing, huh? \n\nYou\u2019re right. He wanted you to validate whatever his current opinion was. While he was buzzed. \n\nNTA. When he calms down he needs a stern talking to about putting you in that situation.", "You\u2019re NTA I suspect that he figures that since you won\u2019t answer, you probably think it\u2019s a bad idea. Maybe he assumes that if you thought that it was something to keep pursuing, you would say so. In a weird way refusing to take a stance may imply you\u2019re leaning towards \u201cit\u2019s a bad idea\u201d and he senses that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
