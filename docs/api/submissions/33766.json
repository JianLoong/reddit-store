I feel they need to go to counseling to deal with this.", "NTA. Your brother knows they should stop. He either can\u2019t make that decision or the wife won\u2019t stop. He is looking for a scapegoat and you didn\u2019t fall into that trap.", "There are an awful lot of Poo modes the last couple of days.", "NTA.

He and his wife have to make that decision, so you were right in not voicing your actual opinion bcuz it wouldn't have helped. He's just upset about the process, not necessarily you and your non-opinion", "NTA. You were in a no win situation here. Deflect, tell the truth or lie.

Your brother shouldn't demand your true opinion after you've told him that you don't think your opinion would help.\n\nRest assured, he'd have been even more unhappy with you if you'd said, \"I am very sorry, but I think you may need to give up.\"", "NTA! This is a \u201cdamned if you do; damned if you don\u2019t\u201d situations.

Your bro has demonstrated to you that his question is an emotional trap, and you aren't obligated to fall into it. \nThat's a shame, because it really is a useful tool to ask someone their honest and unfiltered opinion about what you think they should do, after all the general considerations.", "NTA. You know your brother well and handled it right. I do want to add that adoption is not a fix for infertility or infertility trauma. Especially if it comes to privatized infant adoption, which is incredibly harmful. Keep being as supportive as you can and he will get over it. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s fishing to hear something he\u2019s been thinking reflected back at him but clearly you\u2019re of the opinion he isn\u2019t ready for that kind of convo so I would say trust your gut and it\u2019ll blow over", "Do you think it's possible your brother was asking for permission to stop trying after so many disappointments and needs permission from someone?

Absolutely NTA though.", "I'm still surprised how full grown adults ask for an honest opinion and expect validation.\n\nNTA. You played that smart and you could read the situation correctly. But the hard truth, your brother and wife will not get any younger and they are draining their finances in something that won't happen.", "NAH. If you honestly think your brother and his wife should adopt rather than have biological children then you answered his question as best as you could. Full honesty will make him more upset, and lying won\u2019t help either. Unfortunately you\u2019re in a lose-lose situation with his questioning, so the best course of action may be to give them some space.", "I think your only reasonable response (now that he's presumable sober) would be:\n\nNever try to push your agenda on me or ask my opinion about that again. \n\nNTA", "Totally NTA, you handled it perfectly - trust me on this as I've been in the exact same position with a family member. \n\nBy giving a Yes or No to \"Should we stop trying for kids\" you are almost certainly going to be the bad person if they still can't have a child. \n\nIf you say \"yes\" then later it'll be \"you've taken away their dream, you should have encouraged us to continue\", if you say \"no\" then later it'll be \"you shouldn't have encouraged us and given us false hope\".\n\nBeen there, gave a straight answer, am still the bad person years later....", "NAH. You nailed it. What you gave was not only an honest answer, it was also kind and respectful. Inserting your personal opinion into an already sad and emotionally fraught situation would have served no one. Preserving your loving and supportive relationship with your brother is more important than voicing your thoughts on a matter that is ultimately between him and his wife. \n\nUnder other circumstances, I\u2019d call him an a-hole for pressing the issue, but he gets a pass on this one.", "NTA.

It sounds like you know your brother would make you the villain if you tell him what you really think.\n\nMaybe it's better if you turn the spotlight back on him and ask him why he's asking for your opinion. Has he changed his mind? Are there some other goals he has? What are his plans if this doesn't happen in 2 years? 5 years? Can they provide for a child now after spending so much on fertility treatments?\n\nI'm curious though, why do you think they shouldn't have children?", "NTA and I really admire your strength and self control. A lot of people would be on here saying, \"I didn't want to tell them what I really thought, but they just kept pushing and now everyone is mad at me\". It's good to know the difference between someone who really wants honesty and someone who's just looking for validation.", "NAH\n\nHe's hurting, and you're trying not to hurt him worse. If the question is put to you again, maybe a response of \"I see how much these (failures/losses) are hurting you both, and I don't like seeing you or your wife in pain like that, it's destroying the both of you mentally, emotionally, and spiritually\" would get across the way you feel without it seeming like an attack.", "NTA\n\nHe put you in a no win situation with that question.  You dodged as well as possible.", "NTA - this is an exponentially more lose-lose question than \u201cdoes this make me look fat\u201d.\n\nYour answer was thoughtful and compassionate. Hopefully he will come to realize this.", "It's a bit TA to say \"the honest answer you're pushing for won't help you\", that's admitting you're not being honest!\n\nIf you're going to say \"I'm not being honest\" you may as well say what your actual opinion is.\n\nYou'd do better to say that \"this is your decision and nobody else can tell you that a different decision would make you happier\" IS your honest opinion.", "NTA - You handled this well.

And, while I agree with your point about not wanting to impose trauma on a child just because they want one, I could ask: what, then, makes it ok to impose their own drama on a biological child? If they do finally have one, after all these years, all these costs, all these sacrifices, what are the odds they won't be dumping all of it on that child, imposing unrealistic expectations, trying to control them and make them into the perfect miracle baby? Is this assumption too wild? Maybe, but so is assuming that every adoption comes with trauma and trafficking. Both situations (biological and adoption) can be handled well if the parents are approaching them ethically and with a genuine commitment to put the child's needs first.", "It's like saying eating meat causes modern animal husbandry.

Your opinion isn't very kind, so withholding it IS kind.", "NTA at all. That was the best, most mature, and supportive response you could have given in the situation. \n\nFrom an outside perspective, your brother pushing for your \"honest answer\" comes off as a thinly veiled desire for him to be able to misdirect his anger at the situation towards you. Perhaps your brother knows what you'd say if you were truly honest with him; and perhaps he would even agree with you on some level but could never bring himself to say it. It would be easier for him to get angry with you for being honest with him than for him to admit the hard truths about the situation he and his wife are in regarding their struggles with IVF.", "NTA\nAnd so tactfully handled", "NTA.

I am a man, so out of respect to women defer to them on this obviously. It's not my place to say what they should do with their body, but nature is nature and health is health. My sister got married in her mind thirties. She was contemplating kids but held off. Late thirties she had to have both her ovaries removed due to cysts. She could have tried to save some eggs and do a surrogate but ended up being too expensive and her and her husband couldn't decide if they really wanted kids. Decision made for her, and was emotionally hard for her to come to grips with.\n\nMy wife and I had our one child in our late twenties. Good thing because she's had some things happen that would have made it hard later. Now mid 40s we will have an empty nest. We love our son, but will also be happy to have a degree of child free freedom while still young and healthy enough to enjoy it.", "You're really going very far there. Research shows that in almost all cases adoption has serious negative effects on children even when they are taken from situations that really aren't good for them. (Hence the reason why here in the Netherlands international adoption is indefinitely prohibited and adopting from foster care is nigh impossible as the goal is always to return a child to living with their parents). That means regardless of how well you're doing as a parent, your child has a high chance of having trauma and other issues due to the situation. That is not nearly as strong a given as having a child yourselves.", "NTA\nYou handled this perfectly, and I say this as someone 6 years deep in infertility. The only possible outcome there was hurting his feelings. You absolutely did right not bringing up adoption in that moment.", "As Admiral Ackbar would say, it was a trap, and you did a good job avoiding it. I'll give your brother a break, given the struggle he's going through, and give an NAH, but that's being generous. Harassing people into giving opinions about things they don't want to give opinions about is obnoxious, and he shouldn't have done it. Being angry that you calmly explained why you didn't want to give an opinion compounds it.\n\nYou are 100% not the A H, and he is coming perilously close to becoming one himself.", "I agree that age makes a big difference in fertility but so does genetics and overall health. I have 4 friends who had children in their early 40\u2019s, 3 of the pregnancies being oopsie babies and one couple got pregnant within a few months of trying. Two couples had other children, the other two first time parents so it\u2019s really hard to predict fertility in women at any given age."]}
