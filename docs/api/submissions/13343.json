{"id": 13343, "submission_id": "123t8hp", "title": "AITA for closing my ex wife's bank account", "selftext": "I, 30M, have been divorced from my ex for 5 years. From the time we met, moved in together, got married, separated, and divorced was a total of 3 years. She wasnt great with money and was very manipulative, often yelling when she didnt get her way. I agreed to help her pay some of her bills for a certain amount of time after the divorce and did so through the joint account. We agreed she would shut that account down after that commitment was fulfilled. I stopped using the account when we separated and opened my own account at another bank. \n\nSo I was a bit surprised when she texted me asking me to sign something, saying she has full access to the funds on an account I was named on. She said she was buying a house and needed a waiver signed. She also asked if I could go ahead and get myself off the bank account, too. \n\n I explained to her that I was at work and would look at it when I was off. I didn't understand why the joint account was still open or what the waiver was in context to buying a house. I didn't have to have her sign anything when I bought a house a couple of years ago.\nShe said she would just bring it up to my work for me to sign because it needs to be done asap. I told her no, she wouldn't be coming up to my job, and I'd get back with her after work. Something just felt off with the urgency. You don't just decide to buy a house overnight.\n\nSo when I got off work, I started looking on the banks website, and I saw where the only way to get someone off an account was to close the account completely and open a new account. I sent her a screenshot of that information. She replies saying all you have to do is sign a form at the bank. \nUh, not according to the website. \nBut first thing next morning, I go to that bank and ask to be taken off the account. They confirm that the only way to be taken off the account is to shut it down completely. My ex simply isn't accepting that as an answer and keeps insisting I just sign the waiver for the house. Her boyfriend even called and tried to talk to me about it. \nI explained that I wasn't comfortable signing a waiver for an account we agreed to close. I distinctly remember having that conversation. She said that since everything was attached to this account and I wasn't using it, she should be able to. I disagreed. From what I read, a lender can come after anyone named on the account being borrowed against. I told her no, I wouldn't sign the waiver and requested she withdraw her $120 and close the account. I told her I would close the account myself in a week if she didnt. She called me cussing and screaming and accusing me of doing this on purpose to stop her from bettering herself. Then she blocked me. \n\nA week later, I go to the bank to see if the account is still open. It was and still being used. I withdraw all the money and closed the account myself. I text her boyfriend a time and place to meet to give the money back. He picked up the money no issue. I haven't heard anything since.

Not sure what the waiver was for but the fact she was so keen on it and didn't stick to her end of the agreement with the joint account suggests something is off.  \n\nNot sure how but see if you can do some kind of credit check to make sure she hasn't got you into some kind of debt that you didn't agree to.", "NTA. You agreed years ago that she would close the account. She didn\u2019t. You set a deadline, it wasn\u2019t followed. Then you closed the account and gave them the money. All of that is fair and more than fair. She is the AH for not living up to her promises and for trying to get you into some weirdness with her.", "NTA,  \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9So many red flags!  My name doesn\u2019t need to be anywhere near anybody else\u2019s finances.  The marriage is over, so are the joint finances.", "Opening and closing certain account types that close to a house closing can cause you to be unable to close on the house.  I thought it was line-of-credits only (credit cards, loans, etc), so I doubt a simple checking account would trigger that.\n\nAnyway, NTA.  She was supposed to close it years ago at this point.  Sounds like she was trying to pull something shady, but I could be wrong.", "nta\n\nthis is red flag i would not have signed either", "NTA. she was trying to use you.  Did you read the thing she wanted you to sign?  I wouldn't be at all surprised if she was trying to use your credit score to help her get the loan or something similarly shady.  Good for you for sticking to your guns and giving her the outcome she claimed she wanted in the appropriate way.", "Definitely NtA and there\u2019s something shady here on her part. And she\u2019s clearly upset that you wouldn\u2019t play the part in whatever game she\u2019s trying to play here.", "Nta. If someone is rushing you to sign something, that's suspect. You better read twice what you're signing.", "NTA -Absolutely not the a-hole. You stated facts provided by the bank. You do not need to be legally attached to her even if there was no pending property purchase.\n\nShe can be angry; no biggie. She wanted things her way and that was not a fair or equitable solution.

All the paperwork says is that the money doesn\u2019t belong to someone other then her so there\u2019s no chance of the lending agent being sued. With that said she agreed to close the account and at this stage you should have absolutely no financial connections so since she wasn\u2019t going to get it taken care of it was totally within your rights to do so", "[deleted]", "HELL NO!

Very weird.", "For sure NTAH\n\nShe was trying to sucker you into something that would have ultimately screwed up your credit and god knows what else.  Good on you for being cautious and not giving into a tyrant.  Hope you find someone that isn't COMPLETELY insane.\n\nGood luck!", "I didn't think of that. Thank you for the suggestion", "u/thr0witaway64, you can pull an annual credit report for free in the US. \n\nu/sjw_7 shared a wise recommendation.", "I did read it. It was set up like I had written the letter, with only one sentence in the body. \n\nTo whom it may concern:  \n\n\"Please be advised *her name* has full access to the funds in our joint account *account no.*\n\nThank you,\n *my name*", "Thank you for that perspective.", "Yeah. No. All of this could be explained to OP. The fact that she would call and scream instead of explaining why this is needed rather than closing the account is suspicious. And I seriously doubt the sexism in this. EVERYONE getting a loan needs to prove their financial status. If your finances elsewhere is strong, this account is not a problem to the lender. This likely has nothing to do with OP being a man, but his finances in other accounts being much stronger than hers and her boyfriend's.", "Thank you for the information", "She probably wanted it because that was the account that had the longest history, even if it didn't have the highest balance.  Sometimes with some lenders, especially private lenders, they can get a little iffy if your banking information is all on new accounts.  Like if their banking info only goes back 6 months, that may not be enough for a lender.  So she may have been using this account to show that she has had this account for a long time, as opposed to the ones she opened after you guys split up.  But then because you are a joint name on that account, she needs to account to the lender that the money and the use of the account is only done by her, despite your name being on the account.  \n\nThat is more than likely why she didn't want it closed.  It's more than likely that this is all stuff she is finding out in the process of getting a mortgage approval and getting this letter from you was probably what her broker advised her to do so they can satisfy the lender's requirements.\n\nStill NTA for you though.  She could have explained it all but thought she was going to yell and bully you into doing it.  Not your circus, not your monkey's anymore.", "If her name is on the account, she has full access.  That's what being on the account means.  So weird.", "Thanks for mansplaining something you know nothing about. So typical.", "Ask a few single women about their home buying experiences. You may find that your doubt is misplaced. \n\nRegarding the woman\u2019s behavior, I didn\u2019t comment on that.\n\nEdited to ask: why am I being downvoted for pointing out that gender discrimination in finance exists?", "Ty. I appreciate the information", "... OP DID say she has always been bad at managing finances and she did need help paying bills which OP was the one to provide that help. It's clear who was in a better financial standing. I'm not ignoring facts in the story and jumping straight to \"because you're a man and she's a woman.\"", "Have you experienced this personally? I am a woman and qualified for my home without my partner. As far as the lenders knew, he did not exist and my experience was pretty normal. I had to submit extra documents to the underwriters, but that was to be expected. Curious if anyone can speak of experiencing this in a non-hypothetical fashion.", "That won't mean anything unless I also ask them what their finances are like and how much their savings and average expenses are. I can't be just asking people that even if they're men... \n\nI know you didn't comment on it, that's why I did, she may not be doing anything untoward with the waiver but her not explaining to OP and instead screamed still spells suspiciousness.", "No problem.  I had a family member go through something like this when they were renewing their mortgage with a private lender.  The things the broker was asking for were just insane but it certainly opened my eyes to some of the 'things' that can be done to skirt around rules.", "NTA. I think the waiver was something else. She was going to swindle you or something.", "NTA. May I recommend that you sign up for a Credit Karma account online? It's a free credit monitoring system that you can access anytime you want. What your ex is doing sounds very hinky.", "Also, if this is the account she uses and disclosed on her loan application vs him thinking it was closed and not listing it in his list of assets on his loan application. Big difference in what needs to be done and proven, and the waiver is very common in what the scenario sounds like", "Although interesting two things stick out: 1) She did not close the account years ago per the divorce proceedings and 2) Her '..cussing and screaming' is not respectful nor necessary.  As u/beefsmoke pointed out, her behavior was uncalled for. Perhaps this tactic worked in the past.", "That's what I was thinking, she was trying to use his credit score to get financing.", "I worked processing mortgages for years. Borrowers have to provide 2 months of bank statements to become qualified. If the account that is provided is intended to be used as the cash to close (cash being brought to the table on closing day) account is jointly owned and the other owner is not on the mortgage it is required that a letter is signed by other party on the joint account verifying that the person who is getting the mortgage has access to all of those funds in that account. It is actually very standard and required for some government loan programs.", "My mom basically has no credit because everything is opened under my dads social and everything is shared, she couldn\u2019t even open a credit card with millions in the same bank", "Both my mom and I had to provide extra documentation proving we were divorced. My father (whom I purchased my last house with) did not have to provide any further info. In my case, I never changed my name yet still had to explain why my ex-husbands last name came up as a possible alias on my credit report.", "Well that\u2019s some bullshit. I\u2019m sorry", "NTA, but I loved that you closed the account yourself. That was awesome.", "NTA", "NTA. Ex is something else. Oof.", "NTA. She wanted you to be.liable gor her mortgage", "NTA she was going to try and screw you one last time, but not in a fun way.", "I\u2019m fairly certain she isn\u2019t using an account with a $120 balance in it to provide the cash to close. Last I checked, you need *a lot* more than that to even get approved for a mortgage and so there\u2019s obviously another account somewhere.", "Savings and checking accounts are not on credit reports, credit cards and loans are. Joint credit cards and loans help build credit score of both users. So your mother has never had a loan or credit (joint or not) card in her life?", "My dad had a heart attack in his mid-40s. Mom bought a car based on her income to be sure she had credit in her own name.\n\nShe brought up how angry she was in the 60s because she had store cards as Mom Herself but received new ones as Mrs My Dad as soon as they got married. \n\nBoth grandmas continued to have everything in their husband's names or Mrs My Grandpa and Mrs Second Husband.", "But by keeping the joint account open her credit score is still linked with Op's. That link might be helping her to make her credit look better than it is, so she can get a mortgage that she otherwise wouldn't be able to get. By closing the account Op has now severed the link between their credit scores.", "She\u2019s the secondary user on credit cards so it doesn\u2019t count under her social if she were going to buy a house with a loan .. had to start a prepaid discover card", "Nta..\n\n\nThis is just finalizing dangling bits.", "NTA,  I think you need to check your credit to make sure she hasn't opened up anything in your name. And freeze your credit.", "NTA. However, I would involve your attorney or find one if you haven't, just in case. Keep all receipts, screenshot everything, document, CYA.", "NTA. Sounds like she was trying to pull something since closing an account with only $120 should not have had a lot of bearing on her getting a house. You closed the account. You gave all the money to her boyfriend. You are fully out of her life now, the way it should have been before.", "Definitely NTA.  I don\u2019t know if she was being ignorant or manipulative but either way you couldn\u2019t afford to get tied into that mortgage.", "NTA\n\nBut I'd run a credit check if I were you lol.", "Good idea! A friend of mine found out that his (now ex) wife, who is terrible with money, forged his name as a cosigner to get yet another loan, since she was maxed out on what they'd give her without him on it.", "Thank you!", "It can be more complicated.  Like my husband is on one of his mother\u2019s accounts, she\u2019s on one of his, and my mom is on one of mine.  But they aren\u2019t all actually entitled to use the money in the accounts.  So my husband had to get a letter from his mom for the one she\u2019s on when we were getting a mortgage.  Like legally they could, but if they did they might be getting sued to get it back.", "Believe it or not, there are down payment assistance programs out there were you can close and actually get a little cash back and bring $0 to closing. They are fabulous programs. So it\u2019s certainly possible.", "I did the same thing I bought my home with only my credit not my boyfriends at all and didn\u2019t have to proved any extra information at al just the regular required information", "op=NTA\n\nSounds like she was trying to scam you in some way.\n\nThe only way to get you off the account(according to bank) was to close it.\n\nThe only thing I can think of, is that the lending vendor would look at how long she had the bank account and therefore she didn't want to try to switch at this point because then a new account would be very short term.", "NTA. Also, why did you add \"EDIT for paragraphs\"? :)", "Nta", "My ex-husband didn\u2019t close our joint account despite me pestering him and then overdrew it 2k.

I literally have a better credit score than my husband and Google Fi lets him do payment plans for his phones, but claims my score is too low for it.\n\nStill NTA for closing the account though. She should have closed it like she said she would.", "I\u2019ve never had a checking account affect my credit score. \n\nI assume it could negatively if it goes to collections.\n\nI know some checking accounts you can pay for a boost now. \n\nBut the only way I can think of it benefiting her is if she is an authorized user on a credit card.", "NTA\n\nI would have kept the money -- I W B T A", "\nI'd argue that you can't jump to conclusions like that. Are you consistently getting denied after credit pulls compared to your husband? And did you speak with an actual review customer rep or was it from the web page telling you this after you submitted forms. I was approved for a car loan in person at a dealer. I was approved for a home loan speaking on the phone with a loan officer. But when I tried to apply for this specific credit card online, I was denied. A week later when I applied for another credit card, I was approved. My credit score is high and has no derogatory marks ever. It's easy to claim that I was denied because I'm a minority or something but most likely it has to do with crappy automated evaluation systems built by crappy engineers at that one specific credit card company."]}
