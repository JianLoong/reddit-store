He never had a pet before and thought vet bills were \u201ca hundred or 2\u201d. The shelter said the Pablo had diabetes and would need regular vet visits but my bf didn\u2019t seem to get the memo that is was expensive. I think the shelter wasn\u2019t very responsible either because when he said to me he didn\u2019t think it was expensive they wouldn\u2019t correct him. This was during when pets were getting returned to shelters and it was packed so I understand they didn\u2019t want him to stay but it was so maddening because he seemed deaf.\n\nFast forward, Pablo\u2019s vet bills averaged $2000 last year and meds cost $1400 and this is before factoring in the special diet needed. My bf thought it was a good idea to stiff the vet the last time because he couldn\u2019t afford and now they won\u2019t see him. The vet we go to is the cheapest shelter around and they are still too expensive. Pablo became sick again, I think he might have kidney issues too but the vet won\u2019t see him until the previous bills are paid and my bf wants me to give him $850 for the previous bills and his current checkup could cost as much as $1-2k. I told him to give the cat back to the shelter which is a no kill shelter and can afford the bills because if I give it to him this time he\u2019ll just expect it again and I\u2019m angry he never listened to me how expensive vet bills are. I have enough money in my account but my company had a recent string of layoffs and I\u2019m not willing to give him any knowing he can\u2019t pay back when there\u2019s a chance I might lose my job.

He's an irresponsible pet owner. What's his plan if you're no longer in the picture? He cannot afford this cat. That's very sad, but it's not your responsibility.", "NTA. His cat, his responsibility. You even warned him before adopting the cat about the costs and he didn\u2019t listen or did listen and assumed you would pay. Wishing the best for Pablo!", "NTA... This isn't about your bfs bills, this is about Pablo being in the care of someone who *cannot feasibly care for him* no matter how much he \"cares\" or \"loves him\". If he had the prospects to care for him in the future I'd say go for it and pay the bill, I wouldn't think about it twice myself, but the fact that your bf stiffed the vets office (even tried to begin with) tells us all a lot about his integrity and he's not the honest type apparently.. Tell your bf to stop being selfish and take him back to the shelter. Do it yourself if you have to, whatever it takes to get him where he will get the care he truly needs, and can end up in a home that will truly be able to care for him with more than \"Thoughts and prayers\". \n\nIf you suspect he has renal issues, time is of the essence and he needs care NOW.", "Absolutely NTA. You\u2019d be putting both yourself and your dog\u2019s well being in jeopardy. Unfortunately for your boyfriend, he has to face the reality of his choices and do what\u2019s best for Pablo.", "NTA. Not only is it not your responsibility, but you went as far as to warn him. Making more than him does not mean you owe him anything. Don't pay for the cat. Especially considering the possibility of a lay off, having your own pet to care for. He shouldn't have gotten it and he shouldn't have ignored you.", "NTA. Ditch the needy animal, keep Pablo.", "It would be different if he already had the cat and it got sick unexpectedly. However, it seems he took on a responsibility that he wasn\u2019t ready for. The fact that you warned him and asked him not to get the cat for this exact reason\u2026 you shouldn\u2019t have to \u201clend\u201d him money you know you aren\u2019t getting back. I think you\u2019re right, the cat needs to go back and find an owner that can take care of it. \n\nNot the asshole", "Not paying the vet bill will wreck his credit. Does he get that part? I would not pay it off for him because he has no means to pay it back. But, I would suggest to him that he turn the cat back into shelter care where the cat can be at least provided for. \n\nI think the last vet bill for my dog was about $700. So, I know how costly it can be to take care of an aging or infirm animal. Its like having a baby. It costs a lot more than love even when its worth every penny.\n\n Thing is, its also neglectful to not provide insulin therapy and risk renal failure in a pet because you can't afford the medical care. So, your BF needs to do the right thing by that animal.\n\nNTA.", "NTA - what\u2019s best for this cat is to be back at the shelter. You\u2019re boyfriend is.", "NTA, his pet isn't your responsibility. I dont really know how you can own your own money hostage but hey, it's yours.\n\nI feel bad for the cat because obviously there is an issue and I'm sure he is in pain. Pain that won't be resolved in your boyfriends care.", "NTA \n\nHe\u2019s not entitled to YOUR money! So how can you hold YOUR money hostage? That\u2019s his cat he needs to be responsible for it not you! He can\u2019t even pay the vet he damn sure isn\u2019t going to pay you back.", "NTA - he should never have taken on the responsibility of caring for this cat.", "NTA", "Nta....the way insee it....if you can't pay your own bills don't get anything that costs money for upkeep. He needs to return that cat", "\"Holding the money hostage?\" Wtf?", "This cat is going to continually cost $1,000s of dollars.  If you pay now, you're going to continue to pay until the cat has passed on.", "Withholding judgment for now.\n\nLook, it's not your responsibility. But don't let an animal suffer needlessly.", "NTA\n\n1. No shelter is a no kill shelter they're just step 1 in the process \n2. Your bf is very irresponsible \n3. Don't pay the bills\n4.
