I hope his father's opinion doesn't keep him from being affectionate towards you op.", "**NTA**\n\nNot only is your husband wrong by every developmental measure, but ironically, his argument for his own opinion - that he \"used to coach kids that age\" - just proves that he SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN coaching boys that age, because his own weird hangups and psychosexual insecurities around healthy expressions of love and affection between mother and son suggest that he's not fit to be guiding and mentoring young men,. And the fact that he uses words like \"weird\" vs \"normal\" to describe these behaviours further cements the fact that this is all just deeply immature, insecure opinion with no substantive reasoning or rationale behind it (no actual developmental psychologist or psychiatrist worth their salt would use either of those words in this context).\n\nThe healthiest kids are the ones who are raised to feel SECURE in the love of their parents and families. And being able to express THEIR love as a teenager, at an age when they are most self-conscious, is an excellent sign that they feel that security. You're doing an amazing job. \n\nYour husband, on the other hand, may not be a bad person, but he shouldn't have any say at all in raising children, and particularly not teenaged boys. I suspect that what he thinks is \"normal\" involves some serious repression and really unhealthy, damaging attitudes, and I'd be wary of letting him spend too much time around your son. Look, just for contrast: my best friend, who is a real \"man's man\", and has been in the military for decades and seen multiple combat deployments, and is absolutely revered as a mentor by the young soldiers who serve under him, tells his son CONSTANTLY how much he loves him, hugs him and kisses him, and welcomes those expressions of affection in return because he understands how important that is in making his kid feel secure enough to be independent . . . including when he is away for months at a time.\n\nYou are NTA, but your husband is a whole set of red flags crying out for therapy.", "NTA.

The fact that he feels comfortable to even be like that with you I think just shows that you're a fantastic mother. Keep up the good work and do not listen to your husband.

Show it to your husband and ask him if he thinks there is something wrong about that.\n\nOh, you = NTA. Your husband = TA. Your kid = treasure him.", "Does your husband not have a good relationship with his parents?", "NTA", "NTA. WOW. Your husband would have a real issue with my 4 boys.

I still hug him every time he is leaving to go somewhere. I grew up in an affection less house hold and it has affected me my entire life. Parents were divorced and my Dad was the only parent to show he cared about me. My relationships have been screwed up because of how hard it is for me to actually show affection to other people. So your husband is an AH straight up.", "Your bitter old husband is a weirdo. \"Our son says he loves you a lot, which is different from how kids I used to coach talked to me, so it must be wrong.\"\n\nIs your husband worried about your son's sexual orientation? Sometimes people who have a grievance that they won't state outright, they'll fixate on something else that seems related in their own angry little brains.", "NTA and it honestly scares the shit out of me that your husband was ever in the position to \u201cmentor\u201d young boys. He is the embodiment of toxic masculinity. PLEASE continue to do everything you can to shield your son for this horrible, damaging mind set. You\u2019re doing an AMAZING job and don\u2019t ever let him make your think otherwise!", "NTA. When my son was around 14 he had some friends over to play video games. I walked past the room they were in to head downstairs and he says \"Love you mom\", I replied love you too and headed on downstairs. I heard one of his friends teasing him for saying that. My son replies, \"What, you don't love your mom? That's sad.\" I had the biggest grin on my face.\n\nEdit to add he is now in his 20s and still tells me he loves me regularly.", "Uhhh NTA. I am a 30F, my step sister is 29, my brother is 27, and my step brother is 26.  We all give hugs and say I love you to both of our parents, nothing weird about it. Life is entirely too short to not tell someone you love them while you can because of someone else's preconceived ideas of 'what boys should act like'.", "I must be weird myself then, because as a 34 year old male I still tell my mom I love her every time we talk, hug her when I see her and give her a kiss on her cheek. I've always done this, always will. Its perfectly normal for your son to say it to you. NTA at all.", "NTA. My 13yo boy is the same.

Be happy that your son continues to be able to express his feelings.", "I'm 24 and my mom recently passed away. I wish she was around for me to hug her and tell her I love her again.

It\u2019s a good sign. \n\nIt means not only is your son comfortable expressing his emotions, he views you as a safe person to do this with. You\u2019ve done well.", "NTA but your husband is.", "NTA\n\nYour husband isn\u2019t normal.", "Good grief.   NTA.  Your husband suffers from toxic masculinity.", "NTA. The ability to regulate and express emotions is hard for lots of people (of any gender). Congrats on having a son who seems to be set up for future success in relationships.", "I am sure I will get down voted on this, but you have no right in saying her husband shouldn't \"have any say at all\" in raising his own child.  Boys need men in their life.  Men teach boys things that women cannot.  Women teach boys things thar men cannot.  I assume based on this response that you are a woman.  I am a male raised in a 100% female household.  My personal growth as a male was stunted as a result.\n\nWith respect to the OP, having your teenage son tell you he loves you and give/receive hugs is awesome.  He needs the nurturing you provide and obviously give.  Now, 5-10 times a day may be a little excessive, but better than it not happening.  I am a 50 year old man.  I have a 16 yr old son and 14 yr old daughter and I hug them everyday.  My son is much more affectionate and proactively gives me hugs and tells me he loves me.  My daughter is much more reserved and I try to honor her boundaries outside of the one or two confirming hug(s) a day.  If your son \"requires\" more affection, you should be okay providing it.  Maybe you can ask your husband to hug your son more often.", "This has always been my philosophy. I don't think someday I'll be on my deathbed and regret telling the people I loved how much they meant to me, but I can absolutely see myself regretting not saying it enough.", "Either you didn't read what I said, or you didn't understand it, because \"boys don't need men in their lives\" is THE ANTITHESIS of what I said.\n\nOF COURSE boys need men in their lives. Hell, girls need fathers and men in their lives too. Male role models are super important to every kid. What they don't need is men like her husband, who are dangerously toxic and teach them that \"men don't show emotion\" and that they're \"weird\" and \"not normal\" if they do. It is worse to have a poor role model than to have none.\n\nBoys needing men in their lives doesn't mean that they need whatever person with a penis happens to be closest, particularly if that man is going to pass on really horrible ideas. Boys need HEALTHY, MATURE, EMOTIONALLY INTELLIGENT men in their lives. \n\nPlease don't put words in my mouth. You and I do not fundamentally disagree about the importance of male role models. But thinking that THIS man is an appropriate one? Yeah, no.", "\u2620\ufe0f", "OP and her son don\u2019t have to change their behavior to suit the whims of shitty teenage boys.", "No, you're right. He should definitely act like Edmund Kemper. That is probably far more appropriate for a teenage boy to not get bullied, you think?", "Hate to tell you this, but we live in the real world. They don't have to change their behaviour, but don't act surprised if that doesn't go well for her son.", "There might even be a middle ground available", "Men (like you) pressuring other men and boys to live by their stupid archaic masculinity rules is half the reason boys are so fucked up today. Good on OP for not letting her son be poisoned.", "I love the you symbol. Classy.", "I started singing the song in my head as I read it. I\u2019m glad you did too.", "NTA\n\nHusband needs to learn some emotional depth lol sounds like you've raised a very affectionate young man, his future S.O. will appreciate this greatly.", "So, your son can't leave your side without saying \"love you\" ?  10 times a day? And you can't see that this is not normal? Maybe if you or him are recovering from a serious heath scare.", "NTA.  Your husband is making it weird", "NTA\nThat is really sad your husband thinks that way. My older brother is definitely very masculine, but I will bet a years pay he will ALWAYS come up to my mom and I and hug/kiss us on the head or cheek. He does the same when he leaves and says I love you. Literally always done it and he's in his 30s now! \nDon't let your husband talk you into shunning your son's affection. That will end badly.", "NTA he never saw teen boys being affectionate with their mothers because why would they do that in front of their toxic masculinity sports coach? \n\nNormal teen boys do love their mothers and aren't afraid to express that, unless they've been raised by someone like your husband. \n\nMakes you wonder what other ways he might be negatively influencing your son.", "When my mom was 13, she got embarrassed when her dad kissed her on the lips in front of her friends.

Dude, I still say \"I love you\" to my kids multiple times a day, and they're in their thirties.  (They visit.)  When he was a teenager, one friend teased him for saying \"I love you\" to me, and all his other friends replied, \"You don't say that?!?\"", "NTA get a divorce.

I hope you can find some solid male role models for your son.", "NTA - my 15yo tells me they love me multiple times a day. Every day. They hug and kiss me and we both say I love you every single time either one of us leaves the other, before bed, and at random moments. They make it a point to call me at least once a day when they're at their father's to chat (sometimes it's a quick couple of minutes, others it's a much longer call) and tell me they love me. There is absolutely nothing wrong with making sure those you care about know how much you love them.

My 19 & 21yo boys both tell me they love me. They still end almost every phone call with \"I love you.\" Even when they were surly adolescents, even if I didn't get proactive I-love-yous, they always said, \"I love you too, Mom.\"\n\nYou're obviously NTA. My children's father is not affectionate, and while it didn't exactly damage them, I worry how they would have turned out if I wasn't so loving and affectionate and modeled being emotionally open.
