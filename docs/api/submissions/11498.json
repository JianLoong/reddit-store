I hope his father's opinion doesn't keep him from being affectionate towards you op.", "**NTA**\n\nNot only is your husband wrong by every developmental measure, but ironically, his argument for his own opinion - that he \"used to coach kids that age\" - just proves that he SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN coaching boys that age, because his own weird hangups and psychosexual insecurities around healthy expressions of love and affection between mother and son suggest that he's not fit to be guiding and mentoring young men,. And the fact that he uses words like \"weird\" vs \"normal\" to describe these behaviours further cements the fact that this is all just deeply immature, insecure opinion with no substantive reasoning or rationale behind it (no actual developmental psychologist or psychiatrist worth their salt would use either of those words in this context).\n\nThe healthiest kids are the ones who are raised to feel SECURE in the love of their parents and families. And being able to express THEIR love as a teenager, at an age when they are most self-conscious, is an excellent sign that they feel that security. You're doing an amazing job. \n\nYour husband, on the other hand, may not be a bad person, but he shouldn't have any say at all in raising children, and particularly not teenaged boys. I suspect that what he thinks is \"normal\" involves some serious repression and really unhealthy, damaging attitudes, and I'd be wary of letting him spend too much time around your son. Look, just for contrast: my best friend, who is a real \"man's man\", and has been in the military for decades and seen multiple combat deployments, and is absolutely revered as a mentor by the young soldiers who serve under him, tells his son CONSTANTLY how much he loves him, hugs him and kisses him, and welcomes those expressions of affection in return because he understands how important that is in making his kid feel secure enough to be independent . . . including when he is away for months at a time.\n\nYou are NTA, but your husband is a whole set of red flags crying out for therapy.", "NTA.

The fact that he feels comfortable to even be like that with you I think just shows that you're a fantastic mother. Keep up the good work and do not listen to your husband.

I'm 22 and I still tell my mom this lol.  \n\n\nNTA in the slightest", "Your husband is weird", "Tell him to sod off. My kids (17-20) say it too, we send emojis and come for hugs. NTA, it means you're doing a good job and raising a human being.", "NTA your son is allowed to say he loves you no matter his age", "NTA \n\nYes; by this age society has conditioned many boys to \u2018be a man\u2019 & not express any *girly* emotions but you\u2019ve managed to raise a young man secure enough with himself to continue to express his love & affection for you - great job!", "I grew up tellomg my mom I love her. I tell my wife daily that I love her. When one of us leaves the hoise for any reason we tell each other I love you. Your husband need to take lessons from your son.", "NTA. \nWhat the actual? I tell each member of my family (husband and 3 kids) , separately, that I love them multiple times, every day. I don't leave the house, go to bed, drop them off places, hang up the phone, etc, etc, without saying it. Even if we've argued, even if I'll be back in 5, even if my kids are hormonal jerks and have given me the silent treatment.  \nWhat if it's the last time you talk? Or see them? What if it's the last thing you say?", "My son is 22 and my daughter is 26 and I tell them multiple times during our conversations that I love them and miss them. At the start of it every conversation and during and the end, so not NTA and I\u2019m a 58 male", "NTA. Enjoy it while it lasts. The world needs more love and more people expressing that love. \ud83e\udd17", "NTA. Your husband seems to have some toxic masculinity issues.", "What the hell!  Your husband lives in a very toxic world!  The day your son stops hugging and telling you he loves you is a sad sad sad!  NTA!", "I saw the title and knew I shouldn\u2019t have read this nta you should honestly encourage your husband to go to therapy", "Kids need 8 hugs or some form of physical contact a day just to stay healthy and not literally kill their immune system with stress. Moreso on a bad day.", "NTA. My 21 year old son hugs me and tells me he loves me. My 57 year old husband tells his mother he loves her. I have no parents to tell. Your husband is an asshole.", "NTA\n\nYour husband is wrong, and that attitude is really detrimental to a young person's emotions.", "What? My fianc\u00e9 who is 33 still hugs and says I love you\u2019d to his parents. Obviously not as often since we don\u2019t live under the same roof but at least once a week.", "NTA your husband is weird", "NTA \n\nI'm 27 M, and I usually tell my mother I love her after every phone call, whenever I leave the room, at the end of conversations, etc.", "NTA and what the heck did I just read??\n\nYour son loves you, and he's not afraid to express that! This is absolutely adorable and heartwarming, hubby needs to back off.\n\nCan you even imagine how heartbroken your son would be if he said; \"Love you, mum!\", and you told him to stop saying that? My eight year old tells us she loves us all the time, often out of nowhere. That your son is still doing that at 13 is testament to the bond you two share.\n\nThis one has just plain pissed me off. I'm assuming it's some toxic masculinity crap that hubby needs to stop spreading around.", "NTA, wait, what? Wtf is wrong with your husband?", "NTA\n\nYour husband is both a victim of, and guilty of spreading toxic masculinity. He needs therapy to relearn how to view manhood in a healthy way.\n\nKeep hugging and kissing your son. There is absolutely nothing wrong with it.", "Nta, your husband tho..", "Exactly. Parents are supposed to model healthy emotional expression to their children. Many grown men feel uncomfortable expressing positive emotion to friends and family, simply because a lot of folks my age grew up in the era of \"boys don't cry....or have feelings other than anger and lust\". Horribly toxic, and it sounds like OP's husband may have received that message a little too much when he was a teen. We should be setting a better example for the next generations...and that starts at home. OP should be very proud that her son feels able to understand and verbalize his feelings in a healthy way!", "It is sad.  Having people you love tell you that they love you, too, is wonderful.  So unfortunate the OP's husband has not had that wonderful experience.  Share all the love.\n\nNTA", "\u201cThis is a bunch of namby-pamby crap!  I know when boys need to become men, and I won\u2019t have no boy of mine hanging around his mama\u2019s teat!\u201d", "Classic toxic masculinity: \u201c\u2018Real men\u2019 behave in X way that causes harm to themselves and others, for manly reasons!\u201d \n\nBeing open and affectionate is psychologically and relationally healthy. OP\u2019s husband is being incredibly toxic.", "I'm 36, and my whole family says I love you all the time. My 14 y.o. nephew just asked my mom (his grandma) to snuggle him earlier tonight. \n\nYou're doing a great job.", "Super big gold star.  Wonderful parenting.", "No no no no no no noooooooo!!!!", "It is beyond toxic masculinity,  it's almost borderline emotional abuse.  OPs husband is weird and it's so sad that he feels men can't show affection.  My dad (73) ALWAYS tells us he loves us, he and his siblings always tell each other they love each other, and my grandparents always told their kids.  I always tell my kids and they tell me.   My 17 year old son still occasionally remembers he has a momma and will watch a movie with us and always sits close to me. I can't imagine not telling my kids I love then and hearing it back.", "NTA\n\nAbsolutely NTA. At 25, I still hugged my Mam and told her I loved her all the time. Sometimes for no reason, most times before I went to bed or before I went out.\n\nYou've got a good kid who you've obviously been raising to be kind and not afraid to show affection. Keep up the good work and tell your husband to learn a thing or two how 'real dads' should act.", "NTA\n\nHe clearly has daddy issues and seeing you together causes his insecurities to bubble to the surface.", "Bro I'm 16 and I'm hugging and telling my mom I love her like 50 times a day, NTA.", "NYA I tell my dad I love him at the end of every conversation we have, and have been doing so since for decades, there's no age limit for loving your family.", "NTA. \n\nYou have a loving and caring son. Your husband has a case of toxic masculinity.\n\nTomorrow is my son's 31st birthday.  We were chatting for over an hour today.  He has no problem telling me he loves me and demonstrates it by his loving and caring actions. He has done this his entire life.", "NTA\nYes it's abnormal. It's also fine.", "NTA. Savor it for as long as he does it. I hope he keeps saying it.\nClearly, your husband has grown up with different family dynamics.", "NTA and there\u2019s no reason teenage boys have to be trained to be emotionally stunted to be \u201cnormal\u201d. Teaching him to feel and be open about his emotions and affection is a good thing. I think it\u2019d be worth asking your husband why he things it\u2019s bad or wrong, why it makes him uncomfortable or whatever, because likely the root is simply a result of toxic masculinity that he himself has been victim to and has to deal with as well. \n\nTeenage boys love their moms, there\u2019s no reason they should avoid telling them (or worse, be actively made to stop) because they\u2019re boys. How is that healthy?", "NTA, but the issue isn\u2019t your husband\u2019s age, it\u2019s your husband\u2019s toxic masculinity.", "NTA. May I ask but how much older is your husband? Just my take but it could be that your husband is jealous of the affection your son shows you, or you show towards him. I have a relative like that, and they get jealous too in a similar situation because they don\u2019t have loving parents while growing up. So they usually berate the younger one for showing affection for their parents. Happen to me before too.", "Wtf?  I'm confused as to why you ask this.  Of course neither you nor your son are the ahole here.  \nYour husband is wrong plain and simple.  There is nothing wrong with showing your feelings no matter the age", "NTA. Your husband has serious issues, however. My son is 26 and still hugs me and tells me he loves me. He even brought me flowers for Valentines. Please don't let your husband teach your son to not be affectionate.", "NTA Cherish those \u201cI love you\u201ds! What\u2019s your husband\u2019s issue?", "NTA, I'm 23 and I still hug my mom and tell her 'I love you'", "I\u2019m 21. My parents and I always end calls with love you and take care. F your husband- NTA", "NAH. I still hug and kiss my mum and tell her I love her, and I'm a middle aged man. Your husband may have had a less affectionate upbringing and maybe he isn't as comfortable with physical affection so I can't really say he's an asshole, but equally the way you and your son act isn't unusual either", "NTA. Just because he's emotionally constipated is no reason for your son to be. Boys should be encouraged to express their emotions more", "NTA, I was telling my Dad I loved him until he died and I was married and living a couple of counties away by then. If he was still with us I\u2019d still be telling him and I\u2019m the wrong side of 40 now.", "I'm 42 and my spouse and I took my mom in a couple of years ago.\n\nI still kiss her goodnight, pretty much nightly.\n\nNTA.\n\nIf it's a constant fight, your spouse is weirdly jealous.", "My now 23yr old when he was 13 was exactly the same as yours as was my now 27 yr old , they eventually stopped giving me that kisss on the cheek when getting out the car for school as it was uugghh ( heartbroken me) but still were like that at home but not as much as they did at 13. Your husband has no right to say it's not normal, it is and his only experience of what he calls normal teenage boy behaviour is coaching them on a field where they are less inclined to say I love you to mum, he has no experience of them are home.\n\nEnjoy every minute of your loving  affectionate son as king as he's under your roof as the next few years will fly by and he'll be off building his future", "NTA\n\nhe will probably turn to i hate you until 23 at some point", "My son and I have the same relationship. He\u2019s 26, happily married. A hug and I love you is a natural love language between a parent and child. It will lessen over time. Keep it in your heart and enjoy it an appreciate it while he still does it. NTA", "Or in the real world,  dad knows being the world's biggest mommas boy is going to quickly result in his son being mercilessly bullied, because teenage boys are AHs. \n\nI swear no one on here went to school, or has completely forgotten what it was like. \n\nIs it \"fair\" or \"right\" that openly expressing his love for his mum will get him picked on? Of course not(although 10 times a day, every time he leaves her sight does have some major Bates Motel vibes) but real life isn't kind ir fair, especially school.", "Same here. I've always encouraged it, it just seemed weird that she was still cuddly at 11. Then it occurred to me that my mom hasn't intentionally touched me since I was.11, and that was to slap me. I started dating inappropriately older boys around 12. I've just now realized that I was likely seeking payical affection wherever I could get it.", "I wasn\u2019t like that either, my dad was always openly affectionate, my mother, not at all, we don\u2019t speak now but even before that I can\u2019t remember the last time she gave me a hug. My daughter (not as old as yours) is already telling me I\u2019m \u2018cringe\u2019 so no public cuddles etc, but she\u2019s always plonking down on my lap or next to me for a snuggle at home.", "How would the people at school know if he's saying it in his home? Teenagers bully each other for loads of reasons. There's no need to stop stuff at home in case the dad thinks the son will get bullied for it. I'd imagine puberty and school will be easier for the son if he knows his mam loves and supports him and they have a close open relationship with each other. If the students bully him for loving his mam then maybe he can be more subtle about it but there's no need to stop in case he gets bullied", "My maternal grandfather told me that he loved me every time I visited. He was a lumberjack and truck driver. Like manly man work, old school hard body work. And in touch with his feelings."]}
