I hope his father's opinion doesn't keep him from being affectionate towards you op.", "**NTA**\n\nNot only is your husband wrong by every developmental measure, but ironically, his argument for his own opinion - that he \"used to coach kids that age\" - just proves that he SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN coaching boys that age, because his own weird hangups and psychosexual insecurities around healthy expressions of love and affection between mother and son suggest that he's not fit to be guiding and mentoring young men,. And the fact that he uses words like \"weird\" vs \"normal\" to describe these behaviours further cements the fact that this is all just deeply immature, insecure opinion with no substantive reasoning or rationale behind it (no actual developmental psychologist or psychiatrist worth their salt would use either of those words in this context).\n\nThe healthiest kids are the ones who are raised to feel SECURE in the love of their parents and families. And being able to express THEIR love as a teenager, at an age when they are most self-conscious, is an excellent sign that they feel that security. You're doing an amazing job. \n\nYour husband, on the other hand, may not be a bad person, but he shouldn't have any say at all in raising children, and particularly not teenaged boys. I suspect that what he thinks is \"normal\" involves some serious repression and really unhealthy, damaging attitudes, and I'd be wary of letting him spend too much time around your son. Look, just for contrast: my best friend, who is a real \"man's man\", and has been in the military for decades and seen multiple combat deployments, and is absolutely revered as a mentor by the young soldiers who serve under him, tells his son CONSTANTLY how much he loves him, hugs him and kisses him, and welcomes those expressions of affection in return because he understands how important that is in making his kid feel secure enough to be independent . . . including when he is away for months at a time.\n\nYou are NTA, but your husband is a whole set of red flags crying out for therapy.", "NTA.

The fact that he feels comfortable to even be like that with you I think just shows that you're a fantastic mother. Keep up the good work and do not listen to your husband.
