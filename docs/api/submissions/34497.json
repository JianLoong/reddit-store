It was MY house, not my husband and I\u2019d house. I felt intruded upon. She nagged me about everything I was doing and told me to rest to the point where I finally just literally dropped what I was doing on the floor in the middle of the room and went in my bedroom and shut the door. Like, I had lived on my own for ten years and all of a sudden there was this random adult in my house telling me what to do and hogging my baby. GTFO. Then with my third child she threw my fucking breast milk out. That caused a permanent \u201cyou will never stay in my house again\u201d rule.\n\nTell your husband NO. If he wants to be in the delivery room and if he wants to be around you and the baby after you leave the hospital he will either listen and understand you just had a freaking baby, or you can go stay with your family or friends for now, while you reevaluate your relationship.

I came home from the hospital with both my in-laws and my husband's brother visiting, since it was Christmas.  I delivered a month early.

My BIL assembled the baby basket as an extra bed, which my husband would have been hopeless at.", "NTA but I\u2019m going against the grain here. I found hospital visits way easier, they are short, you don\u2019t have to make coffees or have a tidy house. The nurses will tell them to leave if you or baby need a rest.

I\u2019d have a chat with your husband about them either staying elsewhere after the first month solo, or about having them just for a weekend after a month or two.", "2-3 months seems excessive.telling them you don't want them in the H is perfectly reasonable. I say NTA, but I would say temper your expectations to be more like 3-5 weeks. Make it perfectly clear that while they visit, they WILL be expected to take baby-sitting shifts. You and Hub will want a day to catch up on sleep AND be long overdue for a date/1-on-1 time. They damn sure will not comment  on the condition of the home and will actually help with some upkeep as you and Hub will need it", "Since parents haven\u2019t really declared their plans you can take the initiative. Tell them the projected delivery date and invite them to visit when baby is sleeping through the night\u20263 or 4 months. Lots of pictures will be sent before then.", "I don\u2019t understand why people rush to visit someone right after they had a baby, you need time to heal and recover. NTA, Congratulations btw!", "In laws are by invitation only. When you are good and ready you extend the invite. And that is when they accept. Not a moment sooner. And the time table for that invitation is whenever you damn well please. Tell your husband to get this understood because it will be him that explains it to his parents. End of conversation", "Also had baby through ivf. My in laws are also the \u201cnice and cold\u201d variety. I had(/have?) a major case of anxiety with ppl who I\u2019m not close with holding my baby. I didn\u2019t expect to feel that way, but it lingered strongly for at least 6 months. I\u2019d suggest taking it easy. Don\u2019t have ppl over for at least 4-6 weeks, and keep the visitors for 1 week max.", "Thank you for your feedback!", "3D printed a human \ud83d\ude02 so true. \nThanks for the input!", "Oooh these are all great. Thank you!", "All great points. \nHe hasn\u2019t said anything about what he wanted.

Is there even one in the first place.", "This", "Thank you for this! I\u2019m going to be doing all the night work and well, all the day work \ud83d\ude02 because my husbands work schedule is all over the place so I just feel I\u2019m going to be SO exhausted. And the in-laws give me all of the anxiety and just want to mentally be in a good place.", "Thank you for the feedback!", "They give me sooo much anxiety haha. \nWe definitelyyyy don\u2019t click, but exactly, they aren\u2019t bad people by any means.", "Thanks for your feedback! I definitely don\u2019t want them to feel hurt or anything by my decision, I just want to be mentally ready to have people over who stress me tf out lol.", "I guess I shouldn\u2019t put a time limit on anything, I just don\u2019t know what being a new mom is like so I have nothing to base what I\u2019m going to feel like off of. But setting boundaries for when they are here is great advice.", "Yes we will definitely have to have a more in-depth conversation about it.", "Fair point! We haven\u2019t gone too deep into the discussion so that\u2019s something we\u2019ll definitely have to do.", "While it is both their child, OP is the one giving birth so she gets to decide what is a comfortable environment for her healing and adjusting to mothering - especially if she is considering breastfeeding. I think in this scenario, OP's preferences have more weight because she will be the one giving birth and healing, and if she's breastfeeding stress can affect a new mother's milk supply a lot. \n\nIf the in laws visiting stresses OP out even from the concern of them holding her baby against her comfort level as a new mom, her husband (and the grandparents!) would see it wise to prioritize OP's comfort for the sake of both her and the baby's well being. If OP is genuinely comfortable with them visiting if they stay in a hotel then she should discuss boundaries with her husband around that. **It's about supporting what's best for mom and baby postpartum, not what grandparents want.**\n\nNAH OP", "I will definitely show this to him. Thank you for your support!", "Came here to tell OP about the Lemon Clot Essay!!!", "Thanks for your feedback! I appreciate it!", "And that\u2019s okay, you don\u2019t need to understand everything people post on Reddit. \nTake care \u263a\ufe0f", "You were lucky then. The difference for me was I could ask my mom to do dishes, clean the toilet etc ( but I didn\u2019t have to bc she did it automatically) but my MIL did not and therefore was not a big help and more of a stressor. I needed my moms help, I didn\u2019t need company that was only there to play w the baby. So I don\u2019t think the same rules need to apply.  I could sleep on the couch w my mom sitting there, I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable enough to do that w my in-laws sitting there. They are not always equal or the same and the mother should be able to choose who she wants there to help and ask who she know will add stress to hold off a bit", "My mother lives with us, but I mean yea I would definitely be biased with my own mom if she didn\u2019t live with us to be honest. \nI don\u2019t feel comfortable around his parents at all and they give me a lot of anxiety. But other people have given really helpful suggestions to setting boundaries when they are here that would make it more manageable. Idk what being a mom is like hence the long ass wait time for them, idk if most moms need that or what is considered normal.", "Ugh I\u2019m sorry this was your experience! Such a special time and you weren\u2019t able to feel comfortable in your own home. I\u2019m nervous for that because his mom is very outspoken.", "lol I needed this, thank you. Im such an over thinker so i get really far ahead of myself. So solid point about them probably not flying immediately after. \n\nDefinitely will be closer to second month than one, I don\u2019t function well off of little sleep lol. \n\nWell it sounds like it was really beneficial to have all the help for you. I\u2019m glad your BIL was there to help assemble things haha. So I\u2019ll try and change my perspective on it.", "Setting the hotel and scheduled visits boundary is something I honestly didn\u2019t even think about and I feel that makes it way less stressful.", "Thank you for this advice! A lot of people have suggested this and it makes it less stressful for sure", "They don't sound like they have ever been anything more than tolerant to just abrasive.... That wouldn't have changed overnight.", "Nah, don't take any chance that their presence will be a negative. Especially you but also hubby will already be overwhelmed being 1st time parents so don't add even one little thing to the mix. And face it, they'll b:tch but so what - it's not like they're close to him or you, and loving, unselfish inlaws would understand even if somewhat disappointed.", "A perspective switch might be not be a bad idea. They just give me so much damn anxiety lol", "Now that you mention it, yea probably to be honest. My mom lives with us so there\u2019s an exception. Idk if i\u2019ll actually enforce exactly 3-4 months, idk what to expect as a first time mom.", " I want to be excited about them visiting and seeing their grandchild for my husbands sake, but damn their lack of effort just grinds my damn gears and they stress me tf out lol", "Thanks for the feedback!", "I think that would be sooooo much more manageable for me. I appreciate the advice!", "My husband is a very much \u201cwe don\u2019t need to talk about this now\u201d kinda person. But I\u2019ll try and establish these like asap because he\u2019s planning on telling his parents on Monday.

But the boundaries have been really helpful! \nAnd you\u2019re right as far as treating them like a leper, I guess I\u2019m just resentful at things they have done in the past and that they never prioritize my husband.", "I didn\u2019t even consider them getting a hotel and have certain times to visit. Makes it less stressful for sure", "Thank you for this! This is what I\u2019m nervous about, like what if things are just really hard and baby is colicky and just screaming and I\u2019m overwhelmed or whatever other million things can happen. Other people have suggested firm boundaries for when they do visit and that has also made the visit less stressful. \nI hope he starts latching like a pro soon and yall get some rest!", "My mom lives with us, so no. Also my mom isn\u2019t confrontational and abrasive and she\u2019s genuinely helpful. As far as like extended family and siblings, probably. They are all from out of state so I want babies immune system to have a chance to somewhat develop. It might not necessarily be 3-4 months for family to visit, idk what\u2019s a normal time for moms to not feel like a walking corpse after birth.", "I also get nervous that they are flying and to fly here from there east coast you have to go through multiple airports, it\u2019s an all day travel to get here. Idk when babies immune systems start to develop so also cautious of that.\nBut yes having them here and setting those expectations is great advice. Thank you.", "Yes I kinda want to set the expectation now so we\u2019re all on the same page.", "As a mum of 3, yes, those first few weeks/months are exhausting. On top of your physical and emotional recovery (those pesky hormones) you will most likely be breast feeding or pumping (no shame if you go straight to bottle my first couldn't latch on and 12 yrs later he is a healthy happy pain-in-the-butt pre-teen boy) and learning your babies routines. Your housework is going to move down the priority list, and entertaining/playing hostess probably won't even make the list.\n\nYou are well within your rights to tell people you see EVERYDAY not to come over until you are ready, let alone people you barely see. If you need help reinforcing the boundary point out to people that your baby will be unvaccinated for atleast 6wks and you will not be allowing anyone who is not a member of your household access to the baby until you are comfortable with their health and saftey (don't forget to remind people to get boosters for things like whooping cough and add that to tge list of requirements for access as well).\n\nThe baby you are creating is relying on you to do your best to keep them safe, so do just that, do what you think is best for you and your baby, and you won't be TA.\n\nETA:\n\n>your baby will be unvaccinated for atleast 6wks and you will not be allowing anyone who is not a member of your household access to the baby until you are comfortable with their health and saftey\n\n Notice how I said \"atleast\" and didn't give a definite time frame, vagueness is your friend, use it as much as you need to not be forced into things that make you uncomfortable", "Not just entertain, make it CLEAR that you will not be \u201chosting\u201d in any sense of the word. Not cooking. Not preparing anything ahead of time (cleaning bathrooms, laundry, whatever), nada. You\u2019re taking care of baby. Husband\u2019s job is to take care of you so you can take care of baby (at least for the first 4-6 weeks, longer if you have a c-section). If he wants to manage all that his parents coming to visit would entail on top of you and new baby and sleep deprivation, he can but let everyone know ahead of time that your focus is on your new baby and this visit is not one where they will be hosted like they might have expected.", "Sometimes compromise works best than ultimatums.\n\nBut the most important thing to remember is to think before you set these boundaries on what works for you. Make sure you do not compromise your healthy and wellbeing.\n\nAlso tell him\nThat he can FaceTime during the week so they can see baby until they visit.", "I would add that your in-laws need to contribute if they\u2019re going to be visiting more than a few days. They don\u2019t get to cuddle the baby all day while watching you do laundry and change diapers.", "NAH, also \u201ccold and abrasive\u201d could be them just being very \u201cEast Coast\u201d. A friend just moved back from the west coast because she said she just doesn\u2019t fit the vibe and people always said she was too mean, yet had never gotten that response from anyone where we grew up. So far no one knows if the in laws would want this, just that the husband thinks they might. It sounds like they don\u2019t visit the husband much and might expect OP and Husband to bring the baby east or might defer to being invited to visit.", "It sounds like you have plenty of time to talk things through and if between now and then his parents show more interest and if its something that matters to him I'm sure you and he can come to a reasonable arrangement where you both can be happy and not smothered.", "Please make sure your husband is doing some of the baby care, even if he is working. You being overtired puts you and baby in danger. He has a job that takes part of his time, but a child is 24/7. Work out shifts, even if they change so that you are getting rest. \n\nAnd congrats on your pregnancy!", "Yep and you never know what type of birth experience you are going to have and how long it\u2019s going to take to recover.\n\nHope your pregnancy and birth all goes smoothly.\n\nGood luck and take care!", "That's perfectly understandable. You want to be able to focus on your new baby, without any distractions.", "Pregnancy and babies are unpredictable. They can come early or late. Early babies may be in nicu with limited visitation. As a new grandma, I understand them wanting to meet the little one. I recommend that no specific plans be made until after baby arrives and you have time to get comfortable caring for baby. That first week is chaotic as you figure out very basic things like what pacifiers he likes, feeding may be difficult (both bottle and breast), how he likes to be held. Tons of stuff as you get to know each other. And you are doing all this while healing and not sleeping. This is no time to have guests. You can FaceTime with them and send lots of pictures so you aren\u2019t completely depriving them of contact. It sounds like this is an assumption of your husband\u2019s so They may not even want to come right away or stay with you. Us older people prefer to sleep at night rather than listen to crying babies lol. Congratulations! Babies are the greatest gift!", "You're very welcome. Congratulations on your lovely news & all the best.", "Ugh. You need to be outspoken as well, then. You need to let her know that just because you\u2019re younger it doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t equals, because you are. Don\u2019t let her strongarm you into things you aren\u2019t comfortable with. I wish I\u2019d known that when I was younger. I lived 14 years of hell with a meddling MIL and only last year did I finally put my foot down. I realized my feelings, wants, and needs were being ignored and brushed aside in order to appease my MIL. I decided I didn\u2019t care anymore, and if it meant she doesn\u2019t like me, then oh well. She doesn\u2019t have to like me, but I\u2019m not going anywhere. \n\nStart having a strong backbone now, so you don\u2019t end up miserable like I did. Say no and follow through. It doesn\u2019t matter if anybody else gets upset. You have to put yourself and your baby first sometimes. Especially at first!", "Not much worse than having people stay with a newborn. Unless they are the type to do stuff for you, not just hold the baby and take photos.", "It\u2019s a great essay. Most people just focus on the baby and forget about the mom.", "I\u2019ve seen this happen twice. I have a friend shows mother hated her husband and the feeling was mutual. My friend had her baby and the husband and the mother agreed to a truce. The child is now 11 and the mother and husband have been become very close over the years. Something similar happened for my mom. My paternal grandmother was pretty cold to my mom but after I was born, that changed. The birth of a child can repair relationships very quickly.", "Please be flexible in your thinking.  I would have lost my mind if I had no visitors or adult contact for 3-4 months!", "Tell him that you are a team and need to ensure you are on the same page about it. If he pushes and says they will stay there, tell him that it is all on HIM.  Remind him that if they come in the house, you are going to be under a baby so all cooking, cleaning, etc before, during, and after will be on HIM.  And then, only take care of the baby.  You don't really respect them so you won't care how they think about you...and they don't respect you if they talk crap about you not being more helpful around the house. \n\nI am sorry you are in this situation and I hope he realizes that he is only hurting YOU by giving in to demands of people who won't move an inch to try to see him.", "It's getting better! He sleeps like a champ at night after a good feeding. Personally I think it's a little offensive they've never made an effort to visit you guys, let alone get to know you. But, now that you're having their grandchild, suddenly that's reason enough to buy plane tickets. Maybe try calling them with your husband, and ask if they'd be willing to help you guys. For us, we needed the most help with keeping the house clean, cooking and caring for our pup. Between my in laws and my parents, our freezer was packed to the gills for like 2mo straight lol", "Every woman is different with how long it takes. 3-4 months seems a pretty long time to wait, though, and may cause additional friction as they will likely resent your mother having access when they don't. Will you be asking them to stay in a hotel/motel? Can you limit the amount of time per day they visit so you don't have to feel like you're having to entertain them all day and will have time to recharge between visits? You don't have to give them access whenever they want it, it's your baby, not theirs. But you need to find the right balance so that your boundaries are firm but they're not causing you extra stress - exorcism if you want your children to have a good relationship with their grandparents.", "And they\u2019d be traveling on planes and through airports to get to them too, which introduces the possibility that they\u2019d get an illness a few days in to getting there. If you just found out and you make it full term you\u2019ll be right at the beginning of flu season, and Covid seems like it\u2019s never ending.
