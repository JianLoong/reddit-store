My adoptive parents and I have a good relationship now, but it was rocky for a few years there. They didn\u2019t tell me I was adopted and I found out in what I consider the worst way when I was 16: a spiteful relative told me. Not out for my best interest but they got mad at my mom and was trying to ruin her life. It caused a huge fight within the family and everyone focused on the drama rather than my entire life crumbling. I finally ended up in therapy at 18 and have been attending on and off for the past 10 years (currently on). I didn\u2019t speak to my parents from the time I was 18 until I was 23. They acted like I was insane for being upset about all this.\n\nEventually, they apologized and began going to therapy themselves. We\u2019ve slowly rebuilt our relationship. They have since accepted my search for my bio family and upon finding my bio mom, have been amazing with her.\n\nMy bio mom was coerced into giving me up. She hadn\u2019t wanted to but her family all but forced her. She had no support. My parents didn\u2019t know this part but purposefully chose a private adoption so I\u2019d never know I was adopted. My bio mom and I have known each other for 4 years now. She is an amazing, kind and generous woman who is just like me. I spent so long feeling unseen and different. She was like completing a puzzle. My bio dad died when I was 12 and it\u2019s devastating to know I\u2019ll never meet him. He didn\u2019t want to give me up either but they were very young and again, no support.\n\nMy bio mom told me she had named me Summer, but my adoptive parents changed it. She understood but I could tell the name meant a lot to her.\n\nI recently got married and am changing my last name. I decided since I\u2019m changing my last name, I\u2019ll change my middle name too. It\u2019s got no sentimental meaning vs Summer, which does to my bio mom as it\u2019s her favorite season and I was born on the first day of summer. My bio mom cried tears of joy when I told her. She is so touched. \n\nMy adoptive parents are pissed off. They say that I have erased them. I kept my first name that they gave me. They say if I \u201chad to\u201d I should\u2019ve just added Summer to my name.\n\nAITA?\n\n\nEDIT; because some people are twisting my words.\n\nI am NOT mad I was adopted. Given my bio mom was coerced and forced, someone had to. I was NOT given up out of love. My bio parents loved me but if they had it their way I would\u2019ve been raised by them. \n\nI\u2019m mad I was LIED to for 16 years and by my adoptive parents\u2019 admission they never planned on telling me. I cut them off because they gaslit me and refused to  admit they handled it badly on top of telling me I was crazy for being hurt.\n\nI do not need to be grateful I was adopted. I do not need to be grateful they loved me or provided for me. Those are basic things that SHOULD BE done. I am grateful for a lot, but that doesn\u2019t changed the awful things they did.\n\nMy adoptive parents admitted my middle name is meaningless. They picked it randomly (it\u2019s the stereotypical Marie). So yes, I am sure. \n\nFinally, I did NOT change my name to be vindictive. I changed it to represent both families. I am not upset my name was originally changed. I get it.

But they didn\u2019t. \n\nThey also had their 16yr old child be shattered by learning they were adopted in such a cruel way and didn\u2019t even put her in therapy. OP went to therapy of their own volition at 18 when they cut off their parents. Another mistake by the parents. \n\nThey have now since apologized and started therapy which is great, but doesn\u2019t erase and diminish the hurt OP felt for 23yrs. But they made another mistake - rather than accepting OP\u2019s decision or even quietly stating sadness at the name change they are expressing anger and accusing her of erasing them despite OP having kept her first name.", "Exactly the point. No one tells people they should express all sorts of gratitude for being born, and no one looks at birth parents as some sort of saviour free of fault just for having a child. \n\nYou aren't entitled to your child's gratitude. If you pursue your own wants and desire to have a child, you aren't owed gratitude from that child.

One is not really knowing how to broach the topic, the other is a deliberate deception.", "Apparently it was private so she knew who they were and could have if she really wanted. Its easy to have rose colored eyes when dealing with ones past and hoping for the best of intentions", "Yes, I wonder if her bio mom was a crack head would she have cut her adoptive parents off for all those years. She sounds very ungrateful. She does not need to be grateful for being adopted, but grateful someone loved her enough to choose her. She didn't have a clue, so obviously they loved her. She definitely does not love them though. I can even understand why they wouldn't tell her she was adopted. It was a private adoption and they didn't know anything about the parents. If the parents were criminals with no morals, she would have brought them into their lives.", "Not even remotely. I'd encourage you to do some research on adoption and why an enormous chunk of adoptees are NC with their adoptive parents (hint: it's not because adoptees are hard to raise or anything, it's the APs)", "I'm not sure why you think I didn't read OP's edits. If I didn't read OP's edits, how would I have been able to quote what she said in them?", "Here\u2019s the thing: OP DOESNT have to be grateful for anything. The adoptive parents chose this every step of the way. They chose to adopt. They chose to take on that hypothetical ridicule and questioning. They chose a closed adoption with the intention of lying to their future child. They chose to lie for 16 years. They chose to make OP feel guilty and wrong for being upset about being lied to. Every step of the way they made the choice to be selfish and think only about their own feelings rather than acknowledge and accept their adopted child is a fully rounded human with their own thoughts and feelings. That was their CHOICE. OP does not have to be grateful or quite frankly nice about the choices their adoptive parents made simply because they adopted OP. OP had no say, no real choices, until they were 18 and then they were able to choose to protect themselves from the people whose choices harmed them. They owe the people who made those choices exactly 0 sympathy in my opinion.", "Also don't ever have any biological kids either. Your general attitude and demeanor would not make for a good parent.", "Our daughter was conceived through sperm donor. We didn't tell her because there were relatives that are vehemently against IVF and would have treated her very badly. I always wanted to tell her so she could look for her bio dad if she wanted to. It wouldn't have been right to tell her and then ask that she keep it a secret. It wasn't done out of ego but out of our love for her and her protection.", "True but now that she does know, they\u2019d rather she forgets.", "I don\u2019t know if this is OP\u2019s situation, but I love the way you explained something to be on the lookout for. I found it eloquent and helpful.", "After four years, you generally know if you want to marry someone, which is literally adding them to your family.  Edit:  I agree with the general sentiment of being careful, but it's pretty reasonable to know after for years if you want to add someone to your family.", "Four years is not usually honeymoon phase in dating lmaoooo that\u2019s like 3 months to maaaaybe 2 years for most couples\n\nEdit: I agree to be careful, but saying 4 years is honeymoon phase is just inaccurate", "\u201cGratitude\u201d is very often a cudgel used to ensure compliance, especially if the person you\u2019re supposed to be grateful _to_ is wielding it.

Like smaller good news inside bigger bad news.", "All bet are off if the parents trot out \u201cYou should be grateful\u201d to get you to do things they want you to do.

Bare stats don't tell me anything unless I have read the questionnaire that was used to collect them. As a lawyer friend said to me..choose an opinion and I can find the stats to support you.  have met many adoptees that have great relationships with who raised them.. She sounds like an ungrateful,  entitled git.  Mind you, it may be her writing style and I do not believe everything I read at face value. There are other things she could have done to achieve the end goal but she chose the way she knew would piss off her adoptive patents. Mindless hurt is not a positive thing..", "5th para from the bottom..paraphrased..they had to raise her..", "This is a really vindictive way of thinking. They did the one wrong thing of not telling her and have received the worst possible punishment, she went nuclear. But everything else they did right, that's all overlooked and doesn't even count. Sure they chose to, but this is also the same sub that says parents' love isn't unconditional and shouldn't be taken for granted, yet these people chose to do that and shouldn't be punished so harshly. They're not some evil villains from movies, they did it out of love and fear, therefore misguided by the latter. Why is everything so black and white for? They chose to love a child and gave her a home, she could've ended up somewhere horrible, or worse, aged out of foster care. There are absolutely worse fates that she was saved from.", "I would agree with your reasoning, for your particular circumstances.  OP\u2019s parents did not have that problem of disapproval from family members.  They *all* knew about the adoption.  Why then keep it a secret from the child?", "Tough noodles for them\n\nEdit. Should be noogies", "I\u2019m so glad! It\u2019s so hard to toe that line of being happy for someone but also giving them a little nudge to be careful and watch out for themselves.", "I understand, to me four years still felt really fresh and new! I guess my point was people can still really surprise you at four years, especially if your relationship was tinged with delusions of what could have been and a general penchant to let things sit in your blind spot, which can so easily happen in these dynamics. \n\n\nOnce again, hopefully I don\u2019t come across as some crazy negative bitter redditor, it\u2019s just this really weird common pattern I have my antennas out for in the little \u201cadopted\u201d community.

Most people I know were married by the four-year mark! I do think this is different than a dating relationship but it sounds like OP is sure that bio mom is a good one. :)", "Who said they're owed gratitude? You said it's not an act of charity. Not every act of charity requires gratitude, to me it's just THE RIGHT THING TO DO. Super sad that you can't distinguish that.

Let's just leave the kids in abusive foster homes, I guess.", "That ain\u2019t just any mistake. They lied for 16 years and admitted they would have lied to their graves. Then they said it was crazy she was upset about being lied to. That\u2019s not an oopsie daisy wont happen again mistake and it\u2019s no wonder that when this \u201cspiteful teenager\u201d became an adult she cut them out until they decided to go to therapy. Reading comprehension, try it sometime.", "Lmao first of all, OP is an adult.\n\nSecond of all, the parents aren't getting erased. A meaningless middle name is.\n\nAnd third of all, a lot of people lack reading comprehension skills here.", "No, they made several mistakes. They made most of the mistakes you can make. \n\n1. They opted for a closed adoption. \n2. They hid the adoption from the adoptee. \n3. They changed their child's name and erased her identity and history. \n\nAll three of the above are things adoptive parents do for themselves to make the process easier on them because it's more like the \"normal\" way to have a child (which is what they actually wanted). All of these things are for the benefit of the parent, not the child. \n\n4. When the truth came out, they focused their attention on the related drama, instead of their child's trauma. \n5. They blamed their teenaged child for having trauma around her adoption and their own actions, which were bad. \n6. They refused to take accountability for their own actions that caused trauma to their child. Whatever intentions you have, if you lie to your kid for their whole life and they're traumatized by that, it's still your fault. they should have taken accountability, apologized, and should be supporting OP in her journey to discover where she comes from. \n\nThese parents fully expected a trauma free adoptee, which tells me they weren't trauma informed at all and haven't made an effort to become so. They wanted a baby without all the hassle adoption brings, which is why they didn't plan on telling her. They definitely wanted OP to be \"theirs\" \n\n6. Even now, they cannot accept their grown adult child's autonomy as a distinct person separate from them and are threatened by her budding relationship with and honoring of her bio mom.", "I already addressed this in my initial response.", "I agree", "Nah I definitely agree! I feel like especially with discovering relatives later in life, it can be really easy to hid the past cause it\u2019s hard to dig up and even easy to hide the present because as an adult you\u2019re probably not going to be spending so much time in close proximity with a relative. And there are different dynamics at play from the emotions that come with adoption, the confusion and wishes and hopes and all of that. Plus people can always change. I just can\u2019t imagine 4 years feeling super new to me in a romantic relationship personally! That would be a significant fraction of my life :)", "Right? I grew up in Utah and my parents and most of my friends\u2019 parents dated for less than a year \ud83d\ude02 not that that\u2019s a good thing but\u2026 lol. Even now, where I live outside of Utah, getting married in 2-4 years is not uncommon if you\u2019re older than like 23 or so. I tend to think most people think longer than 5 years starts to get to the area where you question if they wanna get married, unless you\u2019re under 23 like I said. I\u2019ve been with my boyfriend for 2.5 years now and there are so many aspects of him I\u2019ve seen that I know his friends and family will never know. I can predict his reaction to so many different things lol. I KNOW him. We are definitely no longer in the honeymoon phase, I know how he fights and his lowest of lows how much he\u2019s grown since then. I\u2019d say ours was probably like 7-9 months. \n\nAnyway, back to the matter at hand. Totally agree that it\u2019s very different than a romantic relationship. I know who I thought my parents were totally changed when I was about 18. There was a lot I didn\u2019t realize about them for a loooong time. I know it\u2019s also a lot different as a kid, but finding relatives when you\u2019re older isn\u2019t like constantly being around them, so it can be easier for them to hide things, especially the past. I totally agree OP should be cautious, although I\u2019m glad that things are going well. It\u2019s a really rough situation.", "4 years still isn't that long. Lol. I knew hubby pretty good at 4 years, but after 32 years, I know him better than anyone else! 4 years are the honeymoon stage. You guys must be in your twenties or early thirties.", "I do not agree with your interpretation .. she basically says they were forced to raise her.."]}
