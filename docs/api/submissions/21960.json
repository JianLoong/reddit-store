My adoptive parents and I have a good relationship now, but it was rocky for a few years there. They didn\u2019t tell me I was adopted and I found out in what I consider the worst way when I was 16: a spiteful relative told me. Not out for my best interest but they got mad at my mom and was trying to ruin her life. It caused a huge fight within the family and everyone focused on the drama rather than my entire life crumbling. I finally ended up in therapy at 18 and have been attending on and off for the past 10 years (currently on). I didn\u2019t speak to my parents from the time I was 18 until I was 23. They acted like I was insane for being upset about all this.\n\nEventually, they apologized and began going to therapy themselves. We\u2019ve slowly rebuilt our relationship. They have since accepted my search for my bio family and upon finding my bio mom, have been amazing with her.\n\nMy bio mom was coerced into giving me up. She hadn\u2019t wanted to but her family all but forced her. She had no support. My parents didn\u2019t know this part but purposefully chose a private adoption so I\u2019d never know I was adopted. My bio mom and I have known each other for 4 years now. She is an amazing, kind and generous woman who is just like me. I spent so long feeling unseen and different. She was like completing a puzzle. My bio dad died when I was 12 and it\u2019s devastating to know I\u2019ll never meet him. He didn\u2019t want to give me up either but they were very young and again, no support.\n\nMy bio mom told me she had named me Summer, but my adoptive parents changed it. She understood but I could tell the name meant a lot to her.\n\nI recently got married and am changing my last name. I decided since I\u2019m changing my last name, I\u2019ll change my middle name too. It\u2019s got no sentimental meaning vs Summer, which does to my bio mom as it\u2019s her favorite season and I was born on the first day of summer. My bio mom cried tears of joy when I told her. She is so touched. \n\nMy adoptive parents are pissed off. They say that I have erased them. I kept my first name that they gave me. They say if I \u201chad to\u201d I should\u2019ve just added Summer to my name.\n\nAITA?\n\n\nEDIT; because some people are twisting my words.\n\nI am NOT mad I was adopted. Given my bio mom was coerced and forced, someone had to. I was NOT given up out of love. My bio parents loved me but if they had it their way I would\u2019ve been raised by them. \n\nI\u2019m mad I was LIED to for 16 years and by my adoptive parents\u2019 admission they never planned on telling me. I cut them off because they gaslit me and refused to  admit they handled it badly on top of telling me I was crazy for being hurt.\n\nI do not need to be grateful I was adopted. I do not need to be grateful they loved me or provided for me. Those are basic things that SHOULD BE done. I am grateful for a lot, but that doesn\u2019t changed the awful things they did.\n\nMy adoptive parents admitted my middle name is meaningless. They picked it randomly (it\u2019s the stereotypical Marie). So yes, I am sure. \n\nFinally, I did NOT change my name to be vindictive. I changed it to represent both families. I am not upset my name was originally changed. I get it.

And there are different dynamics at play from the emotions that come with adoption, the confusion and wishes and hopes and all of that. Plus people can always change.

Just a few thoughts.\n\nYou write your adopted parents are pissed. They are probably, first and foremost, very sad. Independently of the circumstances, they are the ones who have parented you, who were there for you. Yes, they were likely imperfect - but all parents are. So having you change your name is probably way more significant than you can imagine.\n\nI understand your need to bring your bio-mum in your life. And it seems your adopted parents have been really supportive of that too. \n\nWouldn't it have been possible to keep your name, and add Summer as a middle name. It would, to me anyway, seem like a more sensitive way to do it.\n\nYou are trying to form connection to your birth family. And it is wonderful that you were able to find them and that both family are open to this re-connection. But creating connection doesn't happen through one bold move, it happens painstakingly overtime. If at all possible, be mindful of not unintendedly erasing one family for the other.\n\nI wish you all the best.", "Also adopted. It goes without saying this is your life and changing or amending your own name is absolutely your own choice. \n\nAdoption is a life long experience and it is really sad your adoptive parents did not feel they could be open with you about being adopted. This does go against current (and older) advice but I also see many adopters, even today, who really struggle with this, for many varied reasons. Your feelings about them not telling you are completely valid and normal. \n\nYour comment about how adoption is not charity because 'somebody needed to adopt you' is a comment I find unusual. Where I work, only 13% of children who come into our care actually end up being adopted. For the other 87%, their life is then often spent entirely in care until they reach adulthood. This can very transitory with many children experiencing an unfathomable number of moves. It is extremely sad and a very difficult way to grow up. Nobody 'had' to adopt you and many others are not. \n\nYou also seem to suggest your adoptive parents had selfish interests in adopting you. Whilst it is true many adoptive parents adopt because they are unable to have their own children, I dont know I would describe that as selfish but of course, I have not lived your life or experiences. I am sure you have felt a huge myriad of emotions since you found out you were adopted and it might be helpful to talk to someone about this. There are often charities or services which offer post adoption support and/or counselling to help process your feelings and emotions, even many years later as an adult. \n\nIt sounds like you are really enjoying getting to know your birth mum and that is so special. However, as someone who works to support adopted children to make sense of their past, I would suggest that you may want to consider accessing your own records at some point.\n\nYou say your birth parents were 'coerced' into giving you up. I would be curious to know who 'coerced' them and why as I cant see any further detail to explain what this looked like. In many cases, this may be because birth parents are not in a positon to safely care for and meet the needs of a vulnerable newborn. This can be for many reasons including mental health concerns, domestic violence in the relationship, historic/current concerns or evidence of using drugs/alcohol or parents who are not able to prioritise the needs of a vulnerable newborn baby above their own needs. Involvement with social services is not taken without cause for concern and investigation. \n\nWhilst your birth mum has told you her own perspective on what she felt happened, this may not (and often does not) match the reality of what actually happened.  There are always multiple perspectives and you may find it helpful to explore those. \n\nIt might be possible the agency who placed you for adoption have post adoption support services you can access such as counselling which may be helpful.  If not they should be able to direct you to local services who can help.\n\nWishing you all the best.", "YTA for edits.

It also doesn't mean that, if they do find out, you downplay and ignore their feelings and act like they're insane for being hurt.", "Lol. What timing. There's a wacka-do (not you) who's running around this post with wild histories advocating that closed/private adoptions are abusive. \n\nI know that isn't directly replying to your comment, but I'm kinda too drained to care. Fuck some of these people on this sub are *nuts*.", "Well maybe if they didn\u2019t tell her that she was crazy for being hurt after they kept this secret for her for years then maybe she would have a good relationship with them", "I feel this way too. I made sure my kids names were a bit meaningful, but I also gave them gender neutralish names/middle names, so that if they ever felt their name didnt fit them, they could use the other name if they didnt want a new name. But I also won't be upset if they change any or all their names.", "Projecting", "I missed that, yeah they're just taking it personally then.", "Well said. Plus op being an adult probably puts less pressure on bio to actually show true colors because the work is done. Its usually when the child needs the bio to step up that they actually see the situation. Hopefully this isnt the same for op but it is for so many.", "I\u2019m not adopted, but if this sub taught me anything, it\u2019s that people tend to retell the story in the way that puts them in the most positive light.", "When I was young, a surprising number of my peers were adopted. I couldn't tell you how many eventually went looking for their bio parents, but the two I knew really well had no desire to have a relationship with them (beyond wanting info about the bio parents' medical histories). They saw their adoptive parents as their real parents.\n\nI realize adoptees all feel differently, of course, but I wanted to thank you for the insight into what it feels to be adopted and the obstacles in trying to navigate a relationship with one's bio parents. I hope you're living a wonderful life.", "I mean I can't imagine being lied to for 16 years and then finding out the original plan was to lie to me until the day they died. I also can't imagine finding that out and then having the other people try to spin it as me being in the wrong for being upset while doubling down on their opinion that it wasn't my right to know the genes that literally make up my being.", "Not a single comment friend. It\u2019s the whole thing. Saying they 100 percent want to adopt but a story like this makes them hesitant? Believe me if a story like this where the OP obviously wants to have a relationship with adoptive parents and biological mom makes someone \u201chesitant\u201d, yeah I don\u2019t think you should pursue adoption. Adopted kids should be allowed to have relationships with both sets. If someone can\u2019t handle that, yep I think they should re-think adoption. Also this person goes on to say OP is \u201cburning\u201d her \u201creal\u201d parents\u2026how? Because she wants her middle names changed to honor bio mom? I\u2019m just saying from experience that if someone is this fragile about allowing their adopted kid to have a relationship with bio family and this type of post makes them \u201chesitant\u201d\u2026.well yes they should hesitate and really examine if adoption is a fit for them.", "Really if you feel so hostile towards birth families you honestly shouldn\u2019t adopt from foster care. Most kids in foster care want to retain some relationships with bio family. Also if you say you \u201c100 percent\u201d want to adopt but a story like this makes you hesitant? Why? Because the OP wants to honor her birth mom with her middle name? Also did you forget the part where her REAL parents as you call them didn\u2019t freaking tell her about her origins? Sorry that is screwed up.", "Thank you for proving why you should stay away from adoption lol. Nice work", "You'd make a great adoptive parent with this attitude \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffe", "Im not saying they aren\u2019t her parents. I\u2019m just saying it was wrong, really wrong, to withhold information like that. That\u2019s something a child should know, they have a right to that information", "It's a lie to not share the fact that you adopted them. That doesn't mean they aren't your parents. Take it from someone with chronic, likely hereditary conditions: there is a LOT of information that comes from at MINIMUM knowing you have a different biological family history than your family, and there is a lot of **medical harm** that can come from completely hiding this. That's without even touching the psychological mess that having a shitty, mean family member spitefully tell you your parents have hidden your adoption from you.", "One good reason for people to be hesitant about adopting.", "I am not sure how their relationship is but it just sounds like they\u2019re jealous of the bio parents. They definitely seem to love him but are being selfish. That\u2019s all I got from the post itself.", "Just a note (and only my opinion, for what it's worth). Your child deserves to know the general facts of their conception. It's understandable that you initially hid this information because of your extended family members' negative attitudes towards IVF/sperm donation, but once your child is/was old enough to understand the importance of keeping family information completely private, they should be told about their parentage. \n\nAnd, while the person who donated sperm is biologically the father, he is in no other way \"dad\" to your kid. I donated eggs decades ago. If any children resulted from those donations, they're not my kids even if they are biologically related to me.", "To be honest, screw those family members. Who needs those kind of ppl in their life? When you can't be honest about your CHILD then those people are really far away from your inner circle of love and trust and can be missed if you ask me....", "She needs to know. Do you want her to find out through a DNA test sometime in the future? I was also donor conceived and so were two of my cousins. I've known since day 1. They weren't told until they found out later. One found out through a DNA test. The other's parents told them. I'm the only one well adjusted about it because I've always known. It doesn't change that my dad was the only father I knew. He loved me and cherished me despite me not being his by blood. His family, likewise. But the other two have had massive identity crises over this.\n\nYour daughter needs to know. Sooner rather than later.", "I assume when she is an adult, you will tell her, if only for her own health.  Then she can decide how to handle it.", "You\u2019re denying your child the right to her medical & genetic history, that could be lifesaving someday", "You are one DNA ancestry kit away from that excuse blowing up in your face.", "Exactly, it\u2019s so easy to play \u201cperfect parent\u201d when there\u2019s no one to parent anymore. Just an adult with misplaced expectations. It can take a really long time for people in these situations to show their true colors if they aren\u2019t being genuine from the start.", "Exactly. It\u2019s strange to me that she was so young that she would have had no way of supporting OP on her own, yet she holds fast she was 100% coerced to this day. I feel like a well adjusted 40-50 some year old woman should be able to look back on on that \u201cdecision\u201d with some maturity/clarity and see it as *somewhat* of a good thing for the child? To recognize the life the kid would have had in the care of two incredibly young people would have been *so* rough? It\u2019s little things like that, a lack of introspection, that raise alarm bells for me.", "This was so kind and genuinely human, thank you so much! I\u2019m grateful every day for my unique experience and life circumstances! I\u2019m most definitely someone who would have been far worse off with their bio family haha.", "Yes, but four years of dating is way more intense an experience. I bet she and her bio mom aren\u2019t having sleepovers 3 nights (plus) a week and texting all day long like you do when you\u2019re dating. \n\nI\u2019ve known people for a decade who I would still only refer to as acquaintances despite seeing them every day in an office for 10 straight years. \n\nPlus, since the divorce rate is what? 50% or something, I\u2019m not sure the marriage example is a good one.", "Hopefully it\u2019s not too dumb to paste my other comment but I feel like it fits our discussion as well: \n\n>I understand, to me four years still felt really fresh and new! I guess my point was people can still really surprise you at four years, especially if your relationship was tinged with delusions of what could have been and a general penchant to let things sit in your blind spot, which can so easily happen in these dynamics. \n\n\n>Once again, hopefully I don\u2019t come across as some crazy negative bitter redditor, it\u2019s just this really weird common pattern I have my antennas out for in the little \u201cadopted\u201d community. Maybe I just want to let more people know not to wear their heart on their sleeve and tackle life with a bit more realism, because the fall can so permanently fuck you up.", "I would say it takes roughly 5 to 10 years to reallyyyy know someone when co-living. Like literally not needing to ask things because you already know the answer, knowing everything about their past, having no shame whatsoever etc etc. I mean this is not 4 years house sharing. They just talk and see each other as if they are \"dating\" after 4 years it's more of a friendship not a \"I lived with you, you were there when I had diarrhea and it felt normal not awkward\" kinda situation.\nAnd I say this while I know my husband for 20 years now. There are things that took 10 years to find out, like really the most embarrassing, the darkest, the painful stuff that he didn't tell before.", "I'd say acknowledge good things the same way any kid would. \"I'm glad my parents know how to handle this issue I'm having\" \"I'm so glad I share this hobby with a parent\" etc.", "If the parents were good parents overall and showed their children love/taught them good morals, the vast, vast, vast majority kids will feel grateful without having to be 'obligated' to do so. For example, I love my mom, even though she wasn't perfect, and I'm grateful for what she did for me. No one had to tell me to feel that way. My mom certainly didn't. \n\nMeanwhile, my dad was the one who was always harping on how much he sacrificed for me, how much he did for me, how grateful I should be to him, etc. And surprise, surprise, I never had a good connection with him like I did with my mom. It seems to me like only bad parents are the ones cudgeling their kids with the \"you need to be grateful to me for housing/feeding/clothing\" you line, either to get their kids to behave the way they want or just to vent their own regrets and frustrations. \n\nThat's why I don't like the whole \"kids need to be grateful\" line being repeated. The parents who act like good parents will likely naturally have grateful and loving children who want to help them and be around them. It's not something you can or should force anyone children to feel.", "I\u2019m not hostile to the birth family? I\u2019m sad that 18y of child rearing got erased and she caused real damage to her parents as well when realistically her bio mom is lying to her and she\u2019s buying it but eh it is what it is. As for not revealing origins it was a closed adoption for a reason but as for OP the anger she\u2019s feeling is literally nothing compared to the fact 2 people raised her for 18y and she had a life significantly better then the one she would have had with her bio mom who realistically abandoned her.", "How do you know she didn\u2019t mean she hates stories about the adoptive parents lying to the kid?  \u2018Cause that\u2019s how I was feeling about this story", "Not vindictive at all. They didn\u2019t make one choice, they made a series of choices. Their reasoning doesn\u2019t matter when their choices hurt their child and it took years for them to accept and apologize for that. The whataboutisms and whatifs dont matter. Pulling out that OP may have had a rougher go of it if they hadn\u2019t been adopted by them is 1) not productive because it didn\u2019t happen and 2) is a tactic to diminish OPs valid feeling of being hurt by trying to make her feel guilty for not worshiping her parents for adopting her. That may not be your intention but that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing when you say those things. OPs parents aren\u2019t entitled to niceness when they chose to not treat OP with kindness. Adopting her wasn\u2019t kindness, it was vanity. They wanted a child that was only theirs and lied to the one they adopted to be able to get that.", "Yeah, the idea that someone would look for their egg or sperm donor freaks me out. Is that a normal thing people do? I assumed it was all anonymous for this exact reason. Don\u2019t you already provide all of your health information so that this *doesn\u2019t* ever need to happen? Maybe I\u2019m just making all of this up though and these things don\u2019t work the way I think they do.", "Yeah and that's a HUGE secret to expect to never come out.  What were they thinking?  SO MANY people would have known.", "You are obviously hostile to birth family. First of all you say her life would have been \u201cterrible\u201d with bio mom\u2014why? The best mom I know is my closest friend who had her first child at 16. Also HOW is the OP \u201cerasing\u201d 18 years of child rearing? I can tell you when my teens see their birth families, spend time with them, and appreciate them, it does not \u201cerase\u201d all of my child rearing and the effort I\u2019ve put into being their mom. Because I\u2019m not a fragile self-centered a**. The more people who love my child and the more people my kids love\u2026.is all for the better in terms of their mental health.", "We have to agree to disagree here. You're actively trying to paint them as text book villains and I can't agree with that. I'm sure people adopt out of vanity, but OP didn't indicate that about them at all. So they adopted for the sole purpose of loving a child as theirs, is what I'm going with until proven otherwise. And I didn't diminish her hurt, but it doesn't change the fact that she was extreme and actually cut them off for something they probably did out of fear. It actually was the one misstep of not telling her. And you make it sound like wanting a child that was only theirs isn't what everyone signs up to be parents, want. Why are they villains for that when this is how others approach the situation as well?", "Where does it say forced? It says they had to raise her, and by choosing to become parents, that's true.\n\nPeople who choose to become parents whether by birth or adoption should be expected to raise, feed, shelter, their kids. They chose parenthood. The children don't need to be gracious just because they weren't abused.\n\nAdoptive parents don't deserve more gratitude for that than people who become parents the traditional way.", "How is my pointing out exactly what they did painting them as villains? You can be correct that they made the choices they made out of fear and love, I didn\u2019t dispute that. I\u2019m saying it doesn\u2019t matter that those may be the reasons that they made those choices because they still were wrong. I\u2019m saying that those choices, while maybe not consciously, are rooted in vanity. I\u2019m not saying these people are cartoon villains. I am saying that they aren\u2019t owed anything. If you are interpreting my viewpoint as me calling them villains then maybe think about the fact that you find the behavior I mentioned villainous. OP cut them off when they refused to accept that lying to her was wrong and made her feel bad for being upset about being lied to. That is not extreme. That is OP choosing to establish a boundary for herself to not be around people who diminish her feelings. They don\u2019t have to be evil heartless monsters from the deep for OP cutting them off before to be justified.", "\"had\" being the operative word.  had is not voluntary.  no one forces you to adopt kids and no one forces you to keep the child they adopt.."]}
