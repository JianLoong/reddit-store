My adoptive parents and I have a good relationship now, but it was rocky for a few years there. They didn\u2019t tell me I was adopted and I found out in what I consider the worst way when I was 16: a spiteful relative told me. Not out for my best interest but they got mad at my mom and was trying to ruin her life. It caused a huge fight within the family and everyone focused on the drama rather than my entire life crumbling. I finally ended up in therapy at 18 and have been attending on and off for the past 10 years (currently on). I didn\u2019t speak to my parents from the time I was 18 until I was 23. They acted like I was insane for being upset about all this.\n\nEventually, they apologized and began going to therapy themselves. We\u2019ve slowly rebuilt our relationship. They have since accepted my search for my bio family and upon finding my bio mom, have been amazing with her.\n\nMy bio mom was coerced into giving me up. She hadn\u2019t wanted to but her family all but forced her. She had no support. My parents didn\u2019t know this part but purposefully chose a private adoption so I\u2019d never know I was adopted. My bio mom and I have known each other for 4 years now. She is an amazing, kind and generous woman who is just like me. I spent so long feeling unseen and different. She was like completing a puzzle. My bio dad died when I was 12 and it\u2019s devastating to know I\u2019ll never meet him. He didn\u2019t want to give me up either but they were very young and again, no support.\n\nMy bio mom told me she had named me Summer, but my adoptive parents changed it. She understood but I could tell the name meant a lot to her.\n\nI recently got married and am changing my last name. I decided since I\u2019m changing my last name, I\u2019ll change my middle name too. It\u2019s got no sentimental meaning vs Summer, which does to my bio mom as it\u2019s her favorite season and I was born on the first day of summer. My bio mom cried tears of joy when I told her. She is so touched. \n\nMy adoptive parents are pissed off. They say that I have erased them. I kept my first name that they gave me. They say if I \u201chad to\u201d I should\u2019ve just added Summer to my name.\n\nAITA?\n\n\nEDIT; because some people are twisting my words.\n\nI am NOT mad I was adopted. Given my bio mom was coerced and forced, someone had to. I was NOT given up out of love. My bio parents loved me but if they had it their way I would\u2019ve been raised by them. \n\nI\u2019m mad I was LIED to for 16 years and by my adoptive parents\u2019 admission they never planned on telling me. I cut them off because they gaslit me and refused to  admit they handled it badly on top of telling me I was crazy for being hurt.\n\nI do not need to be grateful I was adopted. I do not need to be grateful they loved me or provided for me. Those are basic things that SHOULD BE done. I am grateful for a lot, but that doesn\u2019t changed the awful things they did.\n\nMy adoptive parents admitted my middle name is meaningless. They picked it randomly (it\u2019s the stereotypical Marie). So yes, I am sure. \n\nFinally, I did NOT change my name to be vindictive. I changed it to represent both families. I am not upset my name was originally changed. I get it.

I'm glad you could find your birth mother and get along with her.

She did not get mad at the wrong person, her adoptive parents earned her anger at them. The fact the truth was finally revealed by the wrong person for malicious reasons doesn't change that.
