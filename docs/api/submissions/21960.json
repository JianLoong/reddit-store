Don't let them make it about themselves. As long as you're happy with the change, that's all that matters.", "NTA. This is your life - your journey - your name. Do what makes you happy.", "NTA\n\nIt's your name, and your life. You get to decide about it and what is significant for you", "NTA\n\nNames are gifts our parents give us. It's up to us whether we keep them, or use them. Honestly speaking as someone who has multiple adopted family members, I can understand how it would be hard to have your adopted child reconnect with their birth parents, but honestly it is always so baffling to me when parents choose not to tell their children they are adopted. \n\nYou had a right to know, and they never should have kept that from you. If having the middle name Summer makes you feel more connected to your birth mother, and makes you happy, then you have every right to use that name, and your parents have no right to try to guilt you for it.", "NTA...as an adult, you are allowed to change your name to anything you want.  It's unfortunate that your adoptive parents aren't more supportive of you and your feelings.  If they had been open with you in the beginning or at least stepped up when the information came out, I would have more respect for them.  They were never going to tell, you which is really selfish on their part.  With so many ancestry sites now, the secret could be out at any time.", "Nta. It's hard to be a kid that's adopted, even harder when you learn the truth when you are almost an adult, and not from your adoptive parents but from someone else. I'm glad you could find your birth mother and get along with her. It's so nice of you to put that special name in your full name, still being considered for your adoptive parents because your first name is still the name they gave you. I am sorry for the loss of your birth father that you sadly couldn't meet. Congrats about getting married.", "NTA...In a world where you could change your name to anything you want; you've decided to honour your birth parents, biological parents, and your spouse.  I think this is very touching and kind.", "You are NTA for changing your name. In the end, it is yours. They didn't freak out that you were planning to change your last name when you were married, I assume. You weren't 'erasing' them then. They are overreacting in the extreme. \n\nFWIW, the fact that they never planned to tell you about the adoption at all is just wrong. I never understand that. Family medical history can be pretty important throughout your life if nothing else.", "Not only are you NTA, but your adoptive parents have seemed to be terrible at every turn. It\u2019s sweet that you want to include your bio mom in this way. Your adoptive parents don\u2019t have a say at this point, and they\u2019ll either get over it or stay mad - either way, that\u2019s not your issue.", "NTA - your parents are still coming to terms with the fact that their big lie blew up in their faces. They made this mess and have no say in how you\u2019re moving forward from it. They should thank their lucky stars every day that you allow contact with them. And if they continue to give you a hard time I suggest cutting contact again.", "Umm...like they didn't try to erase your bio mom?  \n\n\nNTA. You've honored all of your parents. \n\nMy own mother was adopted and her adoptive mother retained her first name as her middle name.", "NTA And  your adoptive parents should have been honest from the beginning.", "NTA - I view names like a gift a parent gives you.  You can keep if forever, secretly hate it, give it away, or decide not to use it as you see fit.  Because like any gift, the giver relinquishes control over it.  \n\nI'm so sorry your parents did this to you, and keep doing this to you. Finding your bio mom didnt subtract anything from your life, or replace them. They are parenting from a place of insecurity but they need to realize that love isn't a sum zero game.", "NTA. Sounds like a lovely, fitting tribute to me. One name from each of your families.", "NTA. You have the right to change your entire name if you wish. Your adoptive parents like to behave as if they own you, but they don't.", "NTA. Your adoptive parents sound very, very selfish. It's your name and you're changing it for really significant reasons for yourself - it's absolutely none of their business and they are definitely not victims of this choice.", "NTAH in total. You have to realize that your adoptive parents chose you to love and take care of. They gave you everything and really wanted you to live a life where you knew of them and them only because some don't take well to being adopted ( I don't know why, you were chosen and loved and given up out of love.) They never meant to hurt you. You got mad at the wrong people and yes it's an insult to them, at the same time your Bio Mom was forced to do something that hurt her and I get why the change. I also however understand the adoptive parents feeling because of how you reacted and how you gave the vengeful relative the victory he or she wanted, they are in pain and you don't seem to care about anyone other than you. \n\n I said you are not the AH only because it did make one other person happy. You just handled the whole thing wrong is all.", "NTA. Clearly, therapy didn't help your adoptive parents. They are quite vile for not acknowledging what they did to you by not telling you that you were adopted.", "YTA and a reason ill never adopt.  It's common for parents to change the child's name when they adopt. You were literally adopted at birth. You're also punishing the people that loved and raised you for your bio mom being forced to give you up. Something you admit your parents were unaware of. Private adoptions are ALSO a thing people do yet you phrase it as if they did it to be malicious. Jeez. You're so ungrateful.", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s just a middle name. They\u2019re being petty. Though it was an overreaction on your part to cut them out of your life completely for 5 years just because they chose not to tell their child they were adopted before adulthood.

Her adopted parents were very upset by it. Fae is LGBT and wanted something to express her own view of herself. She took her deceased birth mother's middle name as her first and used her birth father's last name. It made her birth mother very upset, because it felt like a rejection.\n\nBut adoption erases your history and is made to make the adopted parents feel good. There is so much drama with the adoption industry, with locking up the original birth record and preventing people from knowing their birth history. I would say you have every right to go by whatever name you want. You could even start going by Summer if it would help with your own view of identity.", "NTA.

Your name, your mum, your choice. \n\nYour adoptive parents clearly wanted to erase your bio mum, given how they changed your name and did a private adoption, so you would have never found out. You've just changed your middle name to her choice.\n\nA few of my cousins are adopted, they've always known, although they have no contact with their birth parents as they were removed from that home due to abuse. You're in a very different situation, with a kind birth mother, you should have known, there was no reason for you not to.\n\nHope the wedding goes well.", "NTA.

The adopted parents also chose to lie to her for the first 16 years of her life - for their own reasons. \n\nShe didn't drop her whole name, she changed the MIDDLE name - so not even the name people actually call her. \n\nThe adoptive parents are the ones being selfish right now, no matter how generous they were for her growing up. She isn't erasing them, she is choosing to honor both her bio and adoptive parents with her name. \n\nOP is NTA.", "This feels like you read up on healthy attitudes to adoption just so you could figure out how to say the exact opposite.\n\nFor a start, hiding the fact a child is adopted hasn't been the expert advice for decades. Research shows hiding it can lead to life long negative outcomes for the child. E.g. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0192513X19829503?journalCode=jfia&\n\nThis tells me either the adoptive parents didn't look into it or ask any professionals for advice when they adopted (negligent and reckless), or decided to ignore everything they learned because they wanted to live in a fantasy where OP was their bio daughter and force her to as well (selfish and cruel).\n\nOP had every right to be furious with her adoptive parents. She did not get mad at the wrong person, her adoptive parents earned her anger at them. The fact the truth was finally revealed by the wrong person for malicious reasons doesn't change that. If the adoptive parents had not done the genuinely horrible thing of not telling OP she was adopted, the vengeful relative wouldn't have been able to use it against them.\n\nThen what you said about:\n\n> You have to realize that your adoptive parents chose you to love and take care of. They gave you everything and really wanted you to live a life where you knew of them and them only because some don't take well to being adopted ( I don't know why, you were chosen and loved and given up out of love.)\n\nIs a truly unhealthy viewpoint. You have to realise that adoption is not an act of charity. Adopted people do not owe their parents for raising them. Just like bio children don't. OPs adoptive parents wanted a child and they got one.", "She said that they NEVER planned to tell her she was adopted. That's wrong. Family medical history alone is a huge reason why.", "They never planned on telling me I was adopted. I don\u2019t mind they changed my name. I like my first name.

I tried to talk to them about it and my hurt. They didn\u2019t just keep it from me. I felt like an outsider my whole life and they acted as if I was some huge disappointment for not being like them. Whenever I tried to talk to them about any of it, they told me I was crazy to be upset with them.\n\nThe final straw was me asking if they EVER planned on telling me and they said no. It\u2019s not like they were waiting for me to turn 18. And since the agency had a policy that my bio mom couldn\u2019t reach out until I did, she may have never gotten to know me. Just as my bio dad didn\u2019t. He died of cancer and his biggest regret according to the letter he left me is that he never met me. They could\u2019ve done that to her too. That\u2019s disgusting. \n\nAnd just because it\u2019s normal doesn\u2019t make it okay. It shouldn\u2019t be normal to keep a vital piece of information from someone when you know the truth. They knew who their parents were from Day 1. Even if they didn\u2019t know the names, they had no right to keep the fact they weren\u2019t my bio parents from me.

That\u2019s not the question. I have no regrets or worries about cutting them off. It was deserved and not wrong of me to do.\n\nThe question was about changing my name.
