You just didn\u2019t help her steal. Why do you think you are?", "NTA.  Anna is not a friend.  She tried to get you to lie to your gf over a dress which no doubt Anna would have ruined, destroying your relationship.  Anyone that supports Anna isn\u2019t much of a friend either.  I would ask them why they support Anna, who tried to ruin your relationship by getting you to lie to your gf?  Why should Anna expect you not to tell your gf who deserves to know how horrible Anna\u2019s behavior can be and how untrustworthy she is for future reference?

Good on you for respecting Riley and not doing what Anna wanted to you to do(which is pretty much theft)\n\nSecond, your friends need to understand that NO MEANS NO. How is borrowing a dress an \u201caccommodation\u201d and who is controlling the narrative that your friends are hearing? Are you friends seriously mad at you for not stealing your girlfriend\u2019s dress and giving it to Anna? Or is Anna leaving out that little detail when she shares her side?

If it's important enough to maintain these friendships, do it sooner than later. Two months from now no one will want to hear about it, they'll just assume that you were the one lying and you're trying to fix it when it's all faded in their memories.", "NTA: Anna basically asked you to STEAL the dress.", "NTA. Anna sounds like an entitled, delusional twit.", "NTA. She needed to take the \"no\" but instead tried to be sneaky and pit you against your partner.", "NTA: You were honest with your girlfriend and Anna was trying to get you to do something to betray your girlfriend.

Sorry but Anna was wrong here, she should respect it whenever someone says no.", "NTA. \nShe asked for a dress and was told no. Her response was to ask you to steal your girlfriends clothes behind her back. \nBorrowing clothes is a beautiful thing, but it is not owed. Some garments may be special, and it is absolutely your girlfriends right to refuse. Anna is not entitled to Riley\u2019s clothes just because Anna admires her style. \nAnna could have asked Riley for advise on looking for a gown that\u2019s a similar style, or to help style her for the event. Beyond that is absolutely inappropriate.", "Had you done this for your friend, you would have been stealing her property. What if you did do it and the dress was ruined? You\u2019re NTA at all for saying no. Your friend was told no and wasn\u2019t accepting that. She shouldn\u2019t have asked and put you in this position. What a crappy friend.", "NTA dude. Don't let Anna or her defenders convince you otherwise. What she asked is not ok, and shows she isn't to be trusted.", "Anna was told no.  It should have ended there.  Instead she tried to get you to go behind your girlfriend's back and is now causing drama because she can't get her way.  Pretty shitty friend.  NTA", "NTA.", "Anna wanted you to steal your gf\u2019s dress after declining. Let\u2019s say you did the immoral thing and stole it while your gf was out. \n\nThen what was Anna planning to do with it since your gf knew it didn\u2019t fit her? Was she going to try to have it altered? That would have taken weeks for a bespoke gown, even for a master seamstress. It probably would have cost as much to have it altered as it would have cost to just go shopping. Did Anna really think that your gf wasn\u2019t going to notice that it was missing in that time?

Anna wanted you to betray your girlfriend so she could wear a particular dress. She is placing more value on a dress than her friendship with you. You may have known her since middle school but she is no friend to you.", "NTA. Anna was way out of line.  Your girlfriend saying no should have been the end of the discussion.  That was horrible to ask you to go behind your girlfriends back and sneak out one of her valued possessions directly against her wishes.", "NTA you're a team. Your girlfriend politely declined, and your friend couldn't accept it. She (friend) tried to get you to act in a way that would betray your girlfriend and told your lady about it. You made the right move.", "NTA", "NTA and make sure Anna and that dress are never in the same place. There will most assuredly be an \"oopsie\" that ruins the dress, or an out-and-out malicious attack on it.
