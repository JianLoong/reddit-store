DIL was only around for the last few years while she was sick and never really got to experience her cooking.

It just feels more like an ego thing, rather than a sentimental one.", "NTA. Your son's wife is a huge asshole for trying to keep them, no reasonable person would assume they were being given someone else's grandmother's handwritten recipes.", "NTA She made a bizarre assumption thinking you wouldn't want to keep your mother's recipes. Let them take the break and focus on making a book with all the things you want in it", "NTA. You should get to keep the handwritten recipes", "NTA. I don't think she should feel entitled to those. It's not like you gave them to your son. Those are your mother's you deserve them back. I hope she gets them back to you ASAP.", "NTA you are not responsible for anyone else's assumptions. And, frankly, that is a wild one. Why would she assume you wouldn't want YOUR mothers recipes?", "NTA. The gesture was nice, but your dil didn\u2019t even bother to ask what the most popular and well loved recipes to add into the book, and she has no right to keep the hand written copies. She didn\u2019t really know your mother and they weren\u2019t given to her, they were lent to her. There is a big difference. Let your son take a step back, they\u2019re both being ridiculous.

But I would never have assumed I could have the handwritten recipes of someone who was not my biological grandmother and a relatively recent in-law. \n\nIt was an unreasonable assumption I think and it was incumbent on her to ask if she could keep them permanently.

Also, I think it was a bit presumptuous of your DIL to think you would not want to have your mother's hand-written recipes.\n\nIf many of your mother's staple recipes weren't included, it would be nice to make sure that everyone gets copies of those as well.  Your DIL did a lovely thing by making the recipe books, but she really didn't know which recipes should have been included if she left out so many favorites.\n\nGive your son and DIL some space for now.

I'd just explain that it was a miscommunication, you have nothing against her, but you are keeping your receipts from your mother.", "NTA.\n\nSure there could have been better communication whether from her or you, but she shouldn't have assumed she could keep the originals just because you were nice enough to let her do the project she described to you that you approved of.\n\nLet them take their little break.  They aren't entitled to keep that stuff and should have cleared that with you for sure before assuming as much.", "NTA\n\nThe original recipes have great sentimental value for you and you should have them. DIL is being overly sensitive. \n\nMaybe send her a nice thank you note for making the recipe book and wait for it to blow over.", "Yeah NTA, she had no right to assume she could just keep them", "NTA she's your mother and has nothing to do with DIL in a greater scheme of things, she needs to back off. And your son should know better how would he feel if your stuff when to his kids spouse. Ridiculous.", "NTA Also seems odd that while making the book, she arbitrarily decided which recipes to leave out without checking with anyone.", "NTA. Your DIL is being overly dramatic. Those are your mother's recipes, you get the originals.", "NTA. That was YOUR mother, not hers. If she wanted to keep the recipes, she should have asked and not made it seem like she was borrowing them for the project. \n\nShe isn't entitled to any of your mother's stuff unless you and your siblings agree on it, or if your mother had specified that in a will. Her attitude and your son's attitude are uncalled for.", "NTA. The entitlement of DIL to think she deserves that kind of keepsake is mind blowing. Sounds a bit narcissistic. Ask her why she thinks she should keep YOUR mothers recipes, especially after only being around a few years! Seems like shes trying to keep your son away from the family!", "Nice try, DIL. \n\nThey weren't her's to keep. We had to tell an estranged niece to bring back an old jewelry box full of small momentos. It was part of the estate at that point and she was reminded she could position herself to buy it at the estate sale.", "NTA \n\nWhile what your DIL was a nice, loving gesture, in remembere of your mother, the recipes are yours.\n\nThey are a tie to your loving mother. They are your memories. They are irreplaceable by a book. They are your your mother on her paper, her actual writing, her actual pen. Any actual stain. Each  recipe is a memory of the times that you and your mother prepared it. Each recipe is a memory of your mother's cooking. Each recipe is a memory of your mother's love.\n\nMy mother is 84. She has beginning dementia. She has a lifetime of handwritten recipes.  Most by her mother. Some by my paternal grandmother. Some by other family members. Some by cherished friends. She has kept them in binders for many years. Most are written on cards or scraps of paper. Her recipes are in the binders, as well.\n\nShe doesn't cook now. She let's us do it. She proudly brings out her binders. Finds the recipe that we are to prepare, and tells us stories. About the recipe. About the person and about herself.\n\nPlease share this with your son and daughter in law.\n\nI'm so sorry to learn about your mom's passing. May her recipes bring you a tiny bit of comfort.", "No one said she could keep them does has she bought a trampoline for the conclusion she jumped to?", "Nta\n\n\nFirst from personal experience I know having a close family member handwritten recipes mean to our family. If someone didn't give them back after doing a recipe book we would all be upset. Those stay with you until your ready to give them to one of your children. \n\n\nTheir response is overdramatic and ridiculous. \n\n\nRecipes are a legacy of sorts for some families.  You don't get to be casual about it.\n\n\nGive them space and hopefully they realize how ridiculous they are being.", "NTA why would she think that you, the daughter, wouldn\u2019t want your mother\u2019s recipes back? That was very presumptuous of her to think that she would get to keep them.", "NTA\n\nShe didn't ask to keep them permanently and she had no real reason past making the books for everyone to even handle the recipes.

He ruined everything he couldn't sell for drugs. My grandma just wouldn't tell him no and now the rest of us are left with almost nothing to remember him by. The man walked me down the aisle when I got married, and my favorite shirt of his was destroyed by cigarette burns and who knows what else.", "NTA\nBut another case of lack of communication. You could have told her beforehand that you want them back.

I\u2019ll try to give more context next time.", "NTA. It's very odd that she didn't actually ask and jumped straight to being offended. They're not her memories.", "Nta - sounds like the DIL assumed and found out she was wrong.", "NTA. I\u2019m not sure anyone is the asshole here. Just some really bad communication. You should speak with her and clear the air.", "NTA\nIf she knew your mom for more than a few years and was close to her then maybe I would understand her wanting to keep the originals but she was your mother and from what it seems like you grew up with those recipes. I think it\u2019s completely unreasonable for them to block you over this instead of being actual adults and talking to you about what she thought they decided to be immature about it. I\u2019m sorry for your loss.", "NTA.\n\nIt was a lovely idea to make recipe books for the family. But it sounds like you lent her those recipes with that specific purpose in mind, so I\u2019m not sure how/why they were misinterpreted to be a gift. \n\nWhile I agree with all of the comments that you could have clearly stated you expected them to be returned, if someone said to me \u201chey, can I use your car to run the store?\u201d, I would expect they return it once they were back from the store. I wouldn\u2019t anticipate they suddenly believe they own my car because I didn\u2019t specify otherwise.z\n\nShe asked for the recipes to make her Christmas gifts, she made them, so the originals should be returned.", "NTA You did nothing wrong. It amazes me the frenzy people work themselves into over other peoples' things. Let them take their break. Fuck em.", "NTA.  Your DIL is allowed to use her head. It\u2019s your mothers handwritten recipes. Of course you want them back. They have emotional value for you.", "NTA. Your DIL created thoughtful gifts for the family, but your own mom's handwritten recipes have a bit of her heart and soul in them. I would never presume to keep what are in effect family heirlooms if I was the DIL. She should return them with an apology for the delay, imho. Your son should realize his wife is overstepping, and request his wife return the recipes to you, and end this unfortunate drama.", "NTA... my Mom's were in index card boxes. Her handwriting, the time, over years,  she spent writing the recipes and making them were important to me. I had them for awhile and now my brothers wife has them. your DIL had them, made special memory books, now they are yours.", "NTA.  There was an obvious lack of communication on your part, you should have told her from the get go that you wanted them back.  That being said, if she was not close to you mother, I find it very odd that she would be that upset by not being allowed to keep the handwritten recipes.", "NTA.  As others have said, there should have been clear communication at the start that you expected to get the original recipes back once the books were done.  I also understand how that was missed at the time though, clearing out a loved one's home after they're gone is hard, even just clearing out for an elder to move to assisted living is emotional!  It just feels like DIL made an incorrect assumption about something precious to you.  She really doesn't have a right to something you treasure, especially since she only knew your mother for such a short time.  Let them have their 'little break', and when you talk to them again, let DIL know how much you appreciate having the original recipe cards back.  Hopefully they will come around.\n\nSuggestion: Put the cards for just the staple & family favorite recipes in an archival binder for you to keep.  Let DIL & other family members take turns choosing from the rest.  Then next year, have booklets made up of the favorites for everyone & let each person pick a favorite original to put in their booklets.  Title it \"Grandmother's Recipes II\", and put a little thank you to DIL for the original idea.", "NAH\n\nSounds like a miscommunication occurred. Would have been better when she first took the recipes to have set out everyone's expectations.", "\"DIL, I want to thank you so much for creating this beautiful tribute to my mother. I so appreciate the time and effort you put into creating this recipe book that we can all now share. I know you only knew my mother during the last few years of her life, but your work has created a lasting tribute. Do let me know if any of the recipes are particularly meaningful to you, so I can earmark those for you, in addition to ones I'll be setting aside for the grandkids\"\n\nNAH. It's often difficult when we lose someone to remember to be kind to the other people who also lost them. Just because the loss is different doesn't mean it isn't still a loss. And it's easy for assumptions to clash if we don't take the time to actually spell them out. So while I tend to agree that the handwritten ones still belong to you, I understand how your DIL could feel disrespected by how you framed the situation.\n\nAfter the thank you and some time to clear the air, I would probably go back to her and suggest a project: \"DIL, you did such a lovely job on the recipe book that I wonder if you would be open to doing another one with me? You see, there are a number of recipes in here that I remember from my childhood, or even just a few years before Mom got sick. I would love a second recipe book that had some of those ones...If I pointed out the ones that are particularly meaningful to me, do you think you could create a second book? That maybe we could give out for Christmas next year?\"", "NAH. It sounds like a miscommunication. She's within her rights to be upset, but you're within your rights to ask for something back that she should not have taken in the first place. Grief has exacerbated the situation. \n\nGive them some time, and maybe give her a copy of them once things have settled.", "NTA I think this was probably a communication issue. You should have been clear that you intended to keep the originals.", "She\u2019s a creep and so is your brother.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Yes making the book is nice but doesn't mean she gets the hand written recipies. ALSO WHO THE HELL attempts to curate a family recipe book without knowing the staple recepies!!!! All of the recipes should have been in the book!!! Seriously, my favorite recipe of my great grandmother wasn't anyone else's.\n\n\nAnyway, copy all the recipes so you have a copy of all of them before you give them to the grand children incase they get lost over time.

I'm still stuck on the fact that she didn't include all of the recipes in the book. It doesn't matter if she didn't have any attachment to some of those recipes, others in the family might.\n\nMy wife still has a copy of her maternal grandmother's bbq raccoon recipe. We are never going to use it. But it's a bit of family history. Sadly we don't have a copy of grandma and grandpa's squirrel stew recipe. (As you might guess, grandpa liked hunting. And fishing. And liked the taste of the fish and game he caught.)\n\nIf you have time at some point, get all of those recipes typed up and distributed to the rest of the family. Even if just digital copies. You never know what someone else in the family might want.\n\nIf you don't have time to type them all, at least get good high quality scans so that someone else who does have the time might be able to, no matter where tge originsls get to.

She didn\u2019t even ask if she could keep them but just assumed they belonged to her? That\u2019s your mother, not hers. She did a nice thing, yes, but that does not grant her automatic ownership of the originals. She was being extra.", "Absolutely NTA. Your DIL is BEYOND out of line here.", "NTA at all.  My Dad\u2019s handwritten recipes are some of my greatest treasures.  Your DIL barely knew your mother, she had no right to keep them unless you didn\u2019t want them yourself.  For her to be offended is a her problem.", "NTA. She was YOUR mother, not her's. She doesn't get to steal your memories because she made recipe books. Seems like she was trying to pull a power play of some sort.", "What makes her think she held priority over the actual child of the deceased???\n\nNTA. She's a bit too entitled.", "Your DIL should understand the sentimental value those recipes hold to your family.

There was absolutely no question her recipe book should go to her daughter. No question at all, even though my niece is just a teenager, and her dad has a tendency to get rid of keepsakes. I made sure to photograph each page in the book, just in case the jerk does throw it out, but my niece has so many happy memories of her mom baking, and starting to learn to bake herself; that book, tattered and falling apart as it is, is *hers.*", "NTA, what is wrong with your son and his wife?", "NTA - I would remind your son that those were YOUR mother's handwritten recipes and notes and that they are of extreme value to you. And that you thought you were being generous and trusting in loaning them to DIL but that it was always a loan never a give, regardless of the recipe book.", "NTA, my mom decades ago typed up almost all of her recipes (still trying to get a few that were never written down) including ones she hadn't even tried yet. She included recipes that I don't like because she doesn't know who likes what and wanted to make sure everyone got what they wanted. Your DIL just assumed something that was never stated to her. Even if she included all of your moms recipes, her handwritten recipes holds sentimental value to you since you grew up eating food from those recipes.", "NTA. I dont understand why she feels entitled to it. Atleast my sister in law asked for my grandmother's dish set and made it clear she only wanted it if no one else did because her grandma had the same set and it made her happy to have it.

My cousin got divorced within a year of gran's death and the recipes were lost forever to his ex-wife. You are definitely NTA here. These recipes have a deep, sentimental value to you that your DIL won't understand. And it's not just the recipes, it's being able to see your mum's handwriting and hold the papers she wrote everything out on. If she hasn't experienced a loss before there's a chance she doesn't realise the value they have.

The whole thing is sketchy.", "NTA.  I have all my MIL\u2019s recipes.   When one of the grandkids want a copy, I scan and email them one.  They appreciate seeing her handwriting, and the other marks (water or milk was spilled) brings back their personal memories with her.  Yes, she would bake with the grandkids and grand-daughter in-law.", "NTA, but I think you guys probably should have cleared this up before she walked away with them. The grandkids should have the handwritten ones if they want them.", "NTA\n\nThat did not mean keeping the recipes, I think she was trying to be sneaky about it and got called out on it and is sulking.  Get your recipes back", "Hahaha NTA. DIL feels pretty entitled, don\u2019t she?", "NTA. You were so reasonable and your DIL and son are acting like spoiled brats. She barely knew the lady and that\u2019s your damn mom.", "NTA. It was a nice gesture for her to make the recipe book, but even if she *did* include all the popular recipes everyone would have wanted, the original handwritten recipe cards are a sentimental item that should be shared with people who were closer to her. Honestly I find it kind of odd that she narrowed down recipes to include and apparently didn\u2019t consult anyone about which ones they wanted in it. Unless she only consulted your son assuming he would know the popular ones and he picked the wrong ones for whatever reason.", "NTA! \nWhile what she did was really nice of her, I find it weird and rude of her to expect to keep YOUR mothers original recipes. Why would she assume they were hers to keep?!", "Nta", "NTA. If her making the books was just a kind gesture she wouldn't be bothered by giving the recipes back. She made it weird by making it transactional, clearly she had an ulterior motive when making the books. She isn't the worst person ever or anything but demonstrably wanted to gain something from her actions.", "NAH. I think it is okay that you want them back, but why at any point did you not talk to her knowing her idea and recommend ones she should include, let her know you would want them back,etc?    Your timing I think was also awful, like she just put all this work into doing something so nice and from her point of view I can see where she probably feels like you were being a jerk about a really thoughtful present.", "NTA and DIL made a bizarre leap assuming she could keep them, WTF?!", "NTA. DIL is looking to start trouble. How sad.", "NTA. Those were your moms. The hand writing is your moms, even if you never make one of her recipes again, having something your mom touched and wrote on is something that can\u2019t be replaced.", "NTA", "Nta.

That was your mother, turn the tables and she'd feel the same way. I'm so sorry that her delicate little feelings are/were hurt. What made her think that something so special would be given to her.", "NTA....  My family did the same thing, but we put ALL the receipt in the book..\n\nI'd make copies of all the dish's she left out and send them to the family.  I hope she did this in a 3-ring binder\n\nThey weren't hers to keep.  They belong to the family", "NTA\n\nYeahh i think the natural order of these things would be gma -> you -> whoever you believe should have these recipes. While I usually don't like to seperate in-laws and family I think its important here. She married into this family, this is your mom. The recipes go to you.", "NTA.  This is a personal keepsake from your mother and it's about more than the recipes.\n\nThey were a loan for your DIL's gesture, which you appreciate, and have said so.\n\nIf she is reasonable, she will get over it.  If not, well, make sure the recipes are left to someone else in the will.\n\nAlso, get them all digitized and maybe preserved?", "NTA - The fucking nerve\u2026", "Your son is the asshole. I hate when people just automatically back their partner even if they're wrong. DIL had no actual history with grandma, no emotional attachment to the woman or her food, what is spinning in her tiny little mind that she would think that she's entitled to the originals?\n\nNTA.", "I\u2019m sorry op, NTA.  Regardless of the recipes being recipes, I know quite a few people who keep things a loved one wrote because the loved one wrote it.  There is a magic there, a piece of them to hold on to.  The cookbooks were a thoughtful gift, but the originals were touched by your mom and anyone not able to understand that has issues.", "It's not her mother's recipes - it's your mother's recipes in your mother's handwriting. I can absolutely see how they would be important to you.  Curious if she even asked to take them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "NAH\n\nThis was a simple misunderstanding.", "NTA to the OP. Glad you got those recipes back!\n\nSomething very similar happened to my mom and one of her brothers. My mom has the only original copies of my grandparents wedding pictures. There are 3. She asked everyone if they wanted them and everyone said no. 10+ ago years one of my uncles asked for one of those pics so he could make copies to give as Christmas presents. My mom said sure but that she expected the original back ASAP. One whole year later we are at my uncle's house for a holiday party and my mom sees the original in a beautiful frame on his picture wall. In front of everyone she took it down and put it in her purse and said \"Thanks for the frame!\" My aunt, married to my uncle, cackled and said \"I told you to give it back!!!\" I don't think my uncle has every really forgiven my mom, but she gives absolutely no fucks. That picture is on my mom's picture wall now.", "My thoughts: wow the audacity...", "imo make your own book with the things your mom did make and give it to her (and others of course).  then there will be two volumes of your moms wonderful recipes.", "It's got nothing to do with being sentimental, and everything to do with control. She left out recipes, she did something nobody asked for, and she tried to keep the originals, all because she wanted to. Then she cries disrespect when the person whose mother died asked for the handwritten recipes back?\n\nNope, let them take their break from you. Your son needs to wise up because the more she gets away with the bolder she's likely to be and then it'll be just her and him.", "NTA OP - the DIL and son's responses seem overblown to the request.  I could be wrong but there seems to be trouble there that you don't know about. They probably need the time for their relationship more than what this was about.  When they get over this and themselves and come over, just have her recipe book she gave out on the counter or coffee table.  If that doesn't make her happy, she is just an unhappy person I guess.", "These are YOUR Mother\u2019s handwritten recipes\u2026 why on EARTH would your DIL feel they should belong to her?  \n\nSurely she must recognize the history and memories these recipes bring you - how it feels to look upon her handwriting and be able to see in your minds eye, your Mum\u2019s hand writing them out. Recalling the various occasions certain dishes were made and the warm memories to savour.  Having them close in those moments when you yearn for just a little more time together, as a touchstone of times shared.  \n\nFrankly I feel it is outrageous that DIL would even entertain the THOUGHT of keeping them from you, her grieving daughter.  She requested to use them to compile a book, not as a keepsake for a frail woman she barely knew.  These are the meals from your lifetime with her.  DIL is way, waaay out of line.  \n\n\nYes. Please.  Do take a break from me\u2026 make it a long one.  \n\nNTA and your son and DIL owe you an apology and some empathy.  Hey-Zeus!\n\nMaybe for Christmas you can make a Calendar for the family highlighting the Top 12 legendary recipes and leave it there.  \n\nI\u2019m so sorry they are putting you through this nonsense.  NTA by a million.", "I'm looking forward to the update, where it transpires she published them all and took the royalties", "NTA!!! My god your son was rude. (Sorry for your loss) my grandpa died in 2018 and there is still stuff he has I want but I ask and clarify if I can keep it permanently before actually taking it", "Don't let it bug you. It sounds like a misunderstanding. Let you DIL know how much you appreciate her thoughtfulness and that right now you want to keep the original recipes close to you as they remind you so  much of your mother.", "Right. They are a family heirloom and not sure who she thinks she is but she is not entitled to keep them. They are yours and you have the right to ask for them back. Whether you want to share with the grandkids or keep them for yourself they are yours to do what you please.", "She never had my mothers cooking so she didn\u2019t know which were the recipes she actually made all the time vs. ones that she made once and never again", "This is bugging me too. If there were so many recipes that it was not practical to include them all that\u2019s one thing but then why not ask for help in selecting the ones that would mean the most to the people receiving the recipe books?  Could you imagine receiving something like this intended to trigger happy memories that leaves out dishes that have the most memories associated?", "It's not even just the recipes, it's the actual handwriting. My grandpa passed away last year and when clearing out his office I took back the book I had gifted him the year before, not because I wanted the book but because he had made some hand written notes in it. Handwriting is so unique it's almost like being able to hear his voice again.\n\nAaaaand I've made myself cry.", "When I was reading it, I expected a dispute over a sentimental item, and I was thinking a weak NTA (if OP was more deserving of the recipes that DIL since it was her mother who wrote them, but I could understand why DIL would want them).

ESPECIALLY if I only knew the mother a few years and never tasted her cooking! Nope, just unhinged. But let's say I was that completely dim-witted, when I discovered my mistake? I certainly wouldn't be saying \"I need some distance from you,\" i'd be saying \"OMG, I'm so sorry, of course, I'll bring them right round.\" OP is completely in the clear for having those _entirely reasonable and rational_ expectations.

Wouldn't he know? It's weird that she wouldn't get his input.", ">but I could understand why DIL would want them\n\nWhy?

The whole thing is really weird as far as DIL's behavior goes.", "Not saying you are wrong, but my experience is that communication can help to avoid a lot of drama instead of producing it. Even more among family. I am absolutely with you that OP isn\u2019t in the wrong but her DIL is.", "I think their reading comprehension skills aren't the best and they believe OP didn't get the recipes back.", "The thing is though, if you try to pre-empt every unhinged thing a rational person wouldn't do, you'll just offend every rational person in your life. Like, \"How could you even think I need to be told that!?\"\n\nAnother commenter compared it to reminding your friends to flush if they ask to use the loo. \n\nOf course communication is important but we can't look to assign blame to both sides in every situation. Sometimes one person is just wrong.", "Plus: I don\u2019t put the blame on OP. Not by a long shot", "I think you overthink this or I don\u2019t do a good job in explaining it well enough. This is about a heritage item with personal value. Maybe it\u2019s because I had bad experiences with a similar topic, but if something is important to me I make sure the person I lend it to knows that and takes good care.", "Maybe in that situation you blamed yourself, instead of the person who behaved badly? People with strong intrinsic motivation (which is a brilliant thing in many areas) tend to blame themselves when things go wrong, regardless of whether it's their fault.", "No I didn\u2019t, but I learned from it. I learned not to expect decent behavior from everyone, and before I loose an important item, I make it clear how important it is to me.
