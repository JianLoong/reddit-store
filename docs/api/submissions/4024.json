It just feels more like an ego thing, rather than a sentimental one.", "NTA. Your son's wife is a huge asshole for trying to keep them, no reasonable person would assume they were being given someone else's grandmother's handwritten recipes.", "NTA She made a bizarre assumption thinking you wouldn't want to keep your mother's recipes. Let them take the break and focus on making a book with all the things you want in it", "NTA. You should get to keep the handwritten recipes", "NTA. I don't think she should feel entitled to those. It's not like you gave them to your son. Those are your mother's you deserve them back. I hope she gets them back to you ASAP.", "NTA you are not responsible for anyone else's assumptions. And, frankly, that is a wild one. Why would she assume you wouldn't want YOUR mothers recipes?", "NTA. The gesture was nice, but your dil didn\u2019t even bother to ask what the most popular and well loved recipes were to add into the book. She has no right to keep the hand written copies, she didn\u2019t really know your mother and they weren\u2019t given to her, they were lent to her. There is a big difference. Let your son take a step back, they\u2019re both being ridiculous. I mean your dil didn\u2019t even have the balls to say to your face she was upset.", "NTA\n\nThe gesture of making and sharing the book was very thoughtful. But I would never have assumed I could have the handwritten recipes of someone who was not my biological grandmother and a relatively recent in-law. \n\nIt was an unreasonable assumption I think and it was incumbent on her to ask if she could keep them permanently. She can be upset if she wants, but in what world would you not have wanted your mother\u2019s stuff back unless you explicitly gifted it to her (or it was gifted in a will)?\n\nIf someone who married into the family came to clean my late grandma said, \u201cLook at all these old pictures!

If not, you are not responsible for her assumptions.  Also, I think it was a bit presumptuous of your DIL to think you would not want to have your mother's hand-written recipes.\n\nIf many of your mother's staple recipes weren't included, it would be nice to make sure that everyone gets copies of those as well.  Your DIL did a lovely thing by making the recipe books, but she really didn't know which recipes should have been included if she left out so many favorites.\n\nGive your son and DIL some space for now.

I'd just explain that it was a miscommunication, you have nothing against her, but you are keeping your receipts from your mother.", "NTA.\n\nSure there could have been better communication whether from her or you, but she shouldn't have assumed she could keep the originals just because you were nice enough to let her do the project she described to you that you approved of.\n\nLet them take their little break.  They aren't entitled to keep that stuff and should have cleared that with you for sure before assuming as much.", "NTA\n\nThe original recipes have great sentimental value for you and you should have them. DIL is being overly sensitive. \n\nMaybe send her a nice thank you note for making the recipe book and wait for it to blow over.", "Yeah NTA, she had no right to assume she could just keep them", "NTA she's your mother and has nothing to do with DIL in a greater scheme of things, she needs to back off. And your son should know better how would he feel if your stuff when to his kids spouse. Ridiculous.", "NTA Also seems odd that while making the book, she arbitrarily decided which recipes to leave out without checking with anyone.", "NTA. Your DIL is being overly dramatic. Those are your mother's recipes, you get the originals.", "NTA. That was YOUR mother, not hers. If she wanted to keep the recipes, she should have asked and not made it seem like she was borrowing them for the project. \n\nShe isn't entitled to any of your mother's stuff unless you and your siblings agree on it, or if your mother had specified that in a will. Her attitude and your son's attitude are uncalled for.", "NTA. The entitlement of DIL to think she deserves that kind of keepsake is mind blowing. Sounds a bit narcissistic. Ask her why she thinks she should keep YOUR mothers recipes, especially after only being around a few years! Seems like shes trying to keep your son away from the family!", "Nice try, DIL. \n\nThey weren't her's to keep. We had to tell an estranged niece to bring back an old jewelry box full of small momentos. It was part of the estate at that point and she was reminded she could position herself to buy it at the estate sale.", "NTA \n\nWhile what your DIL was a nice, loving gesture, in remembere of your mother, the recipes are yours.\n\nThey are a tie to your loving mother. They are your memories. They are irreplaceable by a book. They are your your mother on her paper, her actual writing, her actual pen. Any actual stain. Each  recipe is a memory of the times that you and your mother prepared it. Each recipe is a memory of your mother's cooking. Each recipe is a memory of your mother's love.\n\nMy mother is 84. She has beginning dementia. She has a lifetime of handwritten recipes.  Most by her mother. Some by my paternal grandmother. Some by other family members. Some by cherished friends. She has kept them in binders for many years. Most are written on cards or scraps of paper. Her recipes are in the binders, as well.\n\nShe doesn't cook now. She let's us do it. She proudly brings out her binders. Finds the recipe that we are to prepare, and tells us stories. About the recipe. About the person and about herself.\n\nPlease share this with your son and daughter in law.\n\nI'm so sorry to learn about your mom's passing. May her recipes bring you a tiny bit of comfort.", "No one said she could keep them does has she bought a trampoline for the conclusion she jumped to?", "Nta\n\n\nFirst from personal experience I know having a close family member handwritten recipes mean to our family. If someone didn't give them back after doing a recipe book we would all be upset. Those stay with you until your ready to give them to one of your children. \n\n\nTheir response is overdramatic and ridiculous. \n\n\nRecipes are a legacy of sorts for some families.  You don't get to be casual about it.\n\n\nGive them space and hopefully they realize how ridiculous they are being.", "NTA why would she think that you, the daughter, wouldn\u2019t want your mother\u2019s recipes back? That was very presumptuous of her to think that she would get to keep them.", "NTA\n\nShe didn't ask to keep them permanently and she had no real reason past making the books for everyone to even handle the recipes.

He ruined everything he couldn't sell for drugs. My grandma just wouldn't tell him no and now the rest of us are left with almost nothing to remember him by. The man walked me down the aisle when I got married, and my favorite shirt of his was destroyed by cigarette burns and who knows what else.", "NTA\nBut another case of lack of communication. You could have told her beforehand that you want them back. You are definitely not obliged and I don\u2019t feel she is entitled to a non blood relatives heritage but it would have saved you the drama.\n\nEdit: since I didn\u2019t do a good job in this post: I absolutely don\u2019t blame OP. I\u2019ll try to give more context next time.", "NTA. It's very odd that she didn't actually ask and jumped straight to being offended. They're not her memories.", "Nta - sounds like the DIL assumed and found out she was wrong.", "NTA. I\u2019m not sure anyone is the asshole here. Just some really bad communication. You should speak with her and clear the air.", "NTA\nIf she knew your mom for more than a few years and was close to her then maybe I would understand her wanting to keep the originals but she was your mother and from what it seems like you grew up with those recipes. I think it\u2019s completely unreasonable for them to block you over this instead of being actual adults and talking to you about what she thought they decided to be immature about it. I\u2019m sorry for your loss.", "NTA.\n\nIt was a lovely idea to make recipe books for the family. But it sounds like you lent her those recipes with that specific purpose in mind, so I\u2019m not sure how/why they were misinterpreted to be a gift. \n\nWhile I agree with all of the comments that you could have clearly stated you expected them to be returned, if someone said to me \u201chey, can I use your car to run the store?\u201d, I would expect they return it once they were back from the store. I wouldn\u2019t anticipate they suddenly believe they own my car because I didn\u2019t specify otherwise.z\n\nShe asked for the recipes to make her Christmas gifts, she made them, so the originals should be returned.", "NTA You did nothing wrong. It amazes me the frenzy people work themselves into over other peoples' things. Let them take their break. Fuck em.", "NTA.  Your DIL is allowed to use her head. It\u2019s your mothers handwritten recipes. Of course you want them back. They have emotional value for you.", "NTA. Your DIL created thoughtful gifts for the family, but your own mom's handwritten recipes have a bit of her heart and soul in them. I would never presume to keep what are in effect family heirlooms if I was the DIL. She should return them with an apology for the delay, imho. Your son should realize his wife is overstepping, and request his wife return the recipes to you, and end this unfortunate drama.", "NTA... my Mom's were in index card boxes. Her handwriting, the time, over years,  she spent writing the recipes and making them were important to me. I had them for awhile and now my brothers wife has them. your DIL had them, made special memory books, now they are yours.", "NTA.  There was an obvious lack of communication on your part, you should have told her from the get go that you wanted them back.  That being said, if she was not close to you mother, I find it very odd that she would be that upset by not being allowed to keep the handwritten recipes.", "NTA.  As others have said, there should have been clear communication at the start that you expected to get the original recipes back once the books were done.  I also understand how that was missed at the time though, clearing out a loved one's home after they're gone is hard, even just clearing out for an elder to move to assisted living is emotional!  It just feels like DIL made an incorrect assumption about something precious to you.  She really doesn't have a right to something you treasure, especially since she only knew your mother for such a short time.  Let them have their 'little break', and when you talk to them again, let DIL know how much you appreciate having the original recipe cards back.  Hopefully they will come around.\n\nSuggestion: Put the cards for just the staple & family favorite recipes in an archival binder for you to keep.  Let DIL & other family members take turns choosing from the rest.  Then next year, have booklets made up of the favorites for everyone & let each person pick a favorite original to put in their booklets.  Title it \"Grandmother's Recipes II\", and put a little thank you to DIL for the original idea.", "NAH\n\nSounds like a miscommunication occurred. Would have been better when she first took the recipes to have set out everyone's expectations.", "\"DIL, I want to thank you so much for creating this beautiful tribute to my mother. I so appreciate the time and effort you put into creating this recipe book that we can all now share. I know you only knew my mother during the last few years of her life, but your work has created a lasting tribute. Do let me know if any of the recipes are particularly meaningful to you, so I can earmark those for you, in addition to ones I'll be setting aside for the grandkids\"\n\nNAH. It's often difficult when we lose someone to remember to be kind to the other people who also lost them. Just because the loss is different doesn't mean it isn't still a loss. And it's easy for assumptions to clash if we don't take the time to actually spell them out. So while I tend to agree that the handwritten ones still belong to you, I understand how your DIL could feel disrespected by how you framed the situation.\n\nAfter the thank you and some time to clear the air, I would probably go back to her and suggest a project: \"DIL, you did such a lovely job on the recipe book that I wonder if you would be open to doing another one with me? You see, there are a number of recipes in here that I remember from my childhood, or even just a few years before Mom got sick. I would love a second recipe book that had some of those ones...If I pointed out the ones that are particularly meaningful to me, do you think you could create a second book? That maybe we could give out for Christmas next year?\"", "NAH. It sounds like a miscommunication. She's within her rights to be upset, but you're within your rights to ask for something back that she should not have taken in the first place. Grief has exacerbated the situation. \n\nGive them some time, and maybe give her a copy of them once things have settled.", "NTA I think this was probably a communication issue. You should have been clear that you intended to keep the originals.", "She\u2019s a creep and so is your brother.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She shares her love through cooking, and we have shared that love together throughout my entire life. I think OP is absolutely NTA. She even handled it in a very classy manner. Of course she wants her mom's recipes back. Why is this even a question?", "I'm glad I don't have mine, lovely woman, but couldn't cook except for a roast dinner! My other grandad though, as long as you looked past his fondness for brains and tripe was a wonderful cook.", "It would be really cool if you could take her best remembered and favorite dishes and have the originals scanned and bound (and depending on the legibility, possibly also typed on a facing page) so everyone could have a little bit of handwritten history without having to pick who gets what.", "I 100% agree! I got a poem my Grandma wrote tattooed on me, in her handwriting. When I showed my aunt, even though she already knew, she still gasped when she saw it.", "I have no reason to think this really, but I wonder if she wanted to keep them so that she can make the meals not included to get comments like \"this is just like mom/grandma used to make\". I can't think of any reason she would feel more connected and entitled to them than OP.", "If the OP was being a bit much in their reaction to what happened, a reasonable person would roll their eyes and put it down to grief, rather than ratchet up the confrontation.", "I actually like tripe. Sorry. Now squirrel brains and baked raccoon? I'm too delicate for my parents southern delicacies, or what my cousins call cave man food.", "Yeah that\u2019s kind of where my thought processes wanted to go. Like she thought she was doing something that she\u2019d be so unbelievably loved And appreciated about that she could relish in for decades to come. The keeping them to do the meals she knows for a fact she never had but knew they probably did have, was definitely going to be the icing on her ass backwards cake", "I was describing the thoughts I had while I was reading the post. DILs can be close with their grand MILs. The fact that she never knew OP\u2019s mother well was revealed after OP revealed she was hoarding recipes, by which time DIL was already a major AH even without the additional context.", "See my reply to the other comment.", "That's great! Mom taught me how to cook some things not in the book because that was her grandma's recipes and she taught me recipes from grandma and ones that she learned along the way.", "I'm guessing she gatekept some recipes so only she could recreate specific dishes for her husband (OP's son who certainly would have had his grandmother's cooking before).\n\nLike, OP implies the recipes left out were the staples and most loved ones, which I don't think is a coincidence. The son probably reminisced with his wife over what recipes he remembered and liked the most and that allowed her to cherry pick.\n\nBasically, she was trying to stockpile dishes to impress her husband continually at the expense of the rest of the family (and probably for future family events too, to give her a little emotional leverage by way of food).", "Your mom, your heirloom. Why on earth would she think otherwise? Get the handwritten recipes back and give her a book on kindness for Christmas. She could use one.", "NTA- she made an assumption (that sniffs or entitlement) and she was wrong. It was kind of her to make the books but to assume she got to keep the hand written one-of-a-kind extremely sentimental recipes was an overstep. Especially considering she did not include all the recipes in the book. If she\u2019s still around leave them to her in your will. I hope you can show her this thread one day hopefully soon so a light is shone on her entitlement.", "NTA.\n\nEven if you were actively rude when asking her to return them. There's simply no basis for her assuming she was being given the originals to keep.\n\nGo through the box and make sure that everything is actually there. I actively distrust your DIL. Double check that the favorite family recipes are still there and not 'mistakenly and totally by accident' still in DIL's kitchen. Trust but verify, and she's acting weird and sketchy about the whole situation. \n\nIf she continues to make a fuss about it all, retract apology, make a book of your own with all of the actual family favorite recipes, give it to the whole family.\n\nGood intentions do not entitle her to praise and favoritism. She totally missed the point of collecting and publishing family favorite recipes. You're not obligated to be grateful for her intentions.", "NTA.  That is definitely not something she should have assumed or done without talking to you and any siblings you might have.  And I'm surprised she put this book together without working with at least your son and possibly you on what would be appropriate and best to include.", "NTA, but your DIL and son certainly are. In what universe does anybody, other than OP,  have the right to keep her own mother's handwritten recipes? Who would appreciate them the most? Who would have an emotional connection to them? Who was closest to OP's mother? Not the DIL, that's for sure. I can't tell you how much my mother's handwritten recipes mean to me, They evoke so many lovely memories for me of visiting her, eating her cooking and the conversations we had over tea and homemade sugar cookies. My sisters and I shared what we each amongst each other, making copies of our mom's originals. No one else got them but us, because no one else was entitled to them and for every other relative in our family, that went without saying. Son and DIL are way out of line.", "Nta. Most of your post wasn\u2019t even necessary to include. Your whole explanation on WHY you wanted it back is unnecessary. These were your mother\u2019s and, I\u2019m so sorry for your loss, but your mother is gone. They are yours to do with as you please and your dil and son are thoughtless oafs for not realizing that.", "NTA, it wasn't her decision to make on whether she got to keep your mom's recipes! The audacity of acting aggrieved is really gross.", "NTA. They could easily take pictures or rewrite the recipies for themselves, but those personal handwritten recipes from your mom are precious and more meaningful to you.", "NTA\n\nThat is her hand writing. It is something you probably have memories of watching her write, figure out, etc. \n\nOn top of that, she made an assumption. What\u2019s that saying again\u2026?", "NTA\n\nThis is likely in another comment but I would suggest taking the time to make a master copy of all the recipes.  If your mom\u2019s handwriting is good scan would be quickest. \n\nThen you can make copies of the master for whoever wants one before you split up the set by handing out the recipe cards.", "Nta, I'm sorry but your dil and son are acting entitled.", "So when my husband's grandmother died they had a pre-estate sale. It was literally take what you want. There was no saying no to anything. We went the day before the sale. I noticed her recipe box was there. I grabbed it because it hadn't been noticed. She made cookbooks for everyone, and her handwriting wasn't special to me like it would be to her children. Honestly, I forgot about it. I am not even sure anyone else knew it existed. Fast forward a few years. Her daughter (Aunt in law) was in town and I handed her the box. I literally said that it wasn't nearly as special to me as it would be to her. I had handwritten recipes no one else know about and I knew the weren't mine! WTF NTA", "> While we were cleaning out her house my DIL (sons wife) **took** her box of handwritten recipes because **she wanted to make** a recipes book for Christmas for everyone in the family.\n\n****\n> she assumed they were **given** to her to keep and she is disappointed she will not have them.\n\nINFO: There's a disconnect here, were they *given* to her or did she *take* them?", "NTA, not at all, not in any way, shape, or form.\n\nYour SIL was very nice to make the recipe book, it was a lovely meaningful gift.  I hope everybody expressed their appreciation, even if she did leave out your mom's favorite dishes.\n\nBut beyond that, the hand-written recipes have profound, sentimental meaning to your mom's children, and can't possibly have the same meaning to people new to the family who didn't have the opportunity to get close to her.\n\nSo of course, the recipes should have gone back to you.\n\nThe notion that your brother and SIL need a break from you should come as a relief at this point because they're in a ludicrous emotional snit with no basis in reality.  I hope they stay away until they're over it because you shouldn't have to deal with their nonsense.\n\nAnd whatever you do, don't think about apologizing.  This would only reward and reinforce their bad behavior.

Even if she had put every single recipe in the book, I can understand wanting the handwritten ones back. I have my grandmother's handwritten cookbook, and it makes me feel closer to her as weird as that sounds. It seems more special when it's in her handwriting.

You'd be astonished how much time and effort it takes, especially if you're being watchful about errors in the \"original\" and trying to add personal stories. I understand why DIL might have gotten overwhelmed trying to do all of the recipes. That said, she could have asked family members what their favorite recipes were and made sure to include those, and she should not have expected to keep the handwritten cards.

Your son is an ass for saying  they needed to take a break from you.", "NTA, here's my thing, I think it was on her to ask whether or not she was allowed to keep them permanently. And honestly I think it's creepy that she did go out of her way to try and keep something that was her grandmother-in-law's, and give her actual family members incomplete copies.\n\nShe's clearly not close enough to the family given that she left off dishes that the family all enjoy, why should she have even had the recipe cards permanently? They don't have a significant emotional value to her, it feels a little bit like grave-robbing", "NTA of course you want your mothers handwritten recipes. Why wouldn't you? Why would she want them? \n\nDon't mention she chose the wrong recipes. She tried to do a nice thing. She should have asked if there were any particular recipes that people loved but she tried to do something nice. Maybe the recipes she chose were ones your son remembers best. \n\nYou didn't criticise the books, you just wanted the originals with your mums writing.", "NTA, why does she feel entitled to or even want recipes from her MILs mother? How bizarre of an assumption on her end.", "I made something similar for my family.  My aunt was one of the last of the great old-fashioned southern cooks.  Only I had my cousin's wife send me **copies** of her handwritten recipes.  I wouldn't have dreamed of taking the originals.

That comment was unnecessary, petty, and passive aggressive. It is a jab at your DIL and does make you sound ungrateful for the book. My MIL does backhanded crap like this and, guess what, I have no contact with her\n\nI doubt this is the first thing that has ever happened to make your son and DIL decide they need a break from you. This might be the straw that broke the camels back", "Your son praised his grandmother\u2019s cooking. She likely became competitive about it.

I don\u2019t get why she\u2019s think she\u2019s entitled to the originals unless she was grannies favorite baking partner, which you\u2019ve clearly stated that isn\u2019t the case", "Misery loves company.\n\nNTA.", "NTA", "This was your mothers recipes, your history of meals as a child and an adult, memories of holidays, family meals, love and care.

You lent it to her not gave. \n\nAnd it's nice she made the book but she left out other recipes   the more used ones.

When I stayed with a friend while going to school, i put it away and it disappeared. I don't have much from my grandmother. I have a kerchief she wore, and another ring she wore,now. But the other ring. I had it on a necklace.  I wish i could have it back again. I wanted to wear that when I got married, so i could have her with me. I also had a pendant on the chain that a relative gave me it was beautiful.  And in time i was thinking about giving it to my relatives daughter when the time came that her mom passed away. That way she would have something of her mom.", "NTA the handwritten cards are literally from YOUR MOTHER, not hers.", "NTA - It\u2019s weird to me that she thought she should be allowed to keep them.

I was so excited to get handwriting samples of my mother\u2019s when she died. Her handwriting is gorgeous and I have always admired it.

We saw them monthly and more (we are the closest to them). Shoot, they were the first people in his family I met. I can't even imagine keeping something sentimental like this. Sure I have asked if it is okay if I get a copy of grandma's xyz recipe if my MIL is okay with that. The originals belong to her (and her sister), and they get to decide what they want to do with them. My 18 years isn't even close to the 60+ years she was their mom. Like wtf.", "Not to see the worst in people, but I wonder if she left out the staples so she'd be the only one that knows how to make them meaning if anyone wants them, they have to go to her. Definitely a power play.", "An idea if there's a recipe that multiple people want the handwritten original of: high resolution scans. Still divvy up the originals, of course, but I know I'm going to insist my siblings and I do this with all our mom's recipes because having that handwriting is special. \n\nAlso, NTA. DIL assumed something and acted entitled when she was politely corrected.", "So, your DIL is creating drama that is now causing your Son to go NC with you? It sounds to me like she was looking for an excuse to drive a wedge between you and your son, and your son is going along with it when he should stand up to her.", "It\u2019s a power play", "Thankfully the recipe cards are back, but honestly like they should take a break until the daughter-in-law is ready to apologize. Cuz it is totally grave-robbing that she wanted to take heirlooms of significant emotional value to the family. There is no reason for her to even keep the recipe cards and have control of them in the first place, let alone decide which recipes are important and hand off copies to the family", "That's how it's reading to me as well, like this whole project sounds like it was a grab for her to get attention, like not only in starting the project, but her choosing which recipes she thought should be in the family copies of the books. Keeping some of the family recipes out and thus completely detached from the family, and now making up an excuse to isolate the son just add to it", "If you are blocked on everything then I doubt this is the only thing that has happened for them to decide to take a break from you\n\nThere is missing information", "Rather presumptuous?

It sounds like she just wants to shine a spotlight on herself (sorry). The gesture of doing it seems nice....but actually its pretty gross and inappropriate. .\n\nShe didn't know Grandma or her cooking...what makes her think she ought to be doing this? Much less without input from anyone else...If she truly cared to make sure Grammy's recipes live on, she would have asked which recipes were everyone's favorites.\n\nAlso, she didn't author the recipes and she's never had the opportunity to appreciate them so I don't know why she feels so entitled to them. You ARE Grandma's daughter. The recipes are yours.\n\nAnd what really makes me gag is that narcissistic comment about you being ungrateful to her. Sorry you weren't kissing her feet with reverence I guess?", "Obvious NTA\n\nOne thing that sticks out to me. Your son was one of the people who experienced Grandmas cooking.

My goodness, these artifacts are your mother\u2019s handwritten recipes! You are still alive and grieving as her daughter and I\u2019ll bet continue to get a pang of sentiment picturing her fixing all the ingredients around the notes.\n\nHow dare DIL presume that your agreeing to her book gesture meant she could keep everything. You didn\u2019t ask her to invest the time and whatever $ it cost\u2014she offered. People usually do things out of good will at a time others are grieving for a loss.\n\nDouble how dare she throw a tantrum such that your son is on side to take a stance against your presence.\n\nI would say exactly that to the both of them.", "NTA - it's her own fault for just assuming she can take the book.\n\nBut I'd keep an eye out when she's in your home so the book doesn't \"mysteriously\" disappear", "You DIL sounds exhausting. \nEven if she genuinely though she get those the recipes to keep, the correct response is to say \"oh sorry, sure I'll bring them on [X]\".\nIt's okay to misunderstand a situation, but you need to be polite once corrected. \nNTA", "NTA\n\nYour mom made a collection of them to keep in the family and for the grandkids (both your kids and siblings') to have part of her passed on. \n\nYou worked with DIL and let her use the original copies to make the books.

I am honestly shocked that the DIL, who has known her only a few years, felt that she was entitled to keep your mother's handwritten recipes.\n\nIf she's an overall nice person otherwise, then maybe this is chocked up to a misunderstanding and you can write her a note saying that while you genuinely appreciate the recipe books, the handwritten recipes are a beloved memory of your mother and that you had always intended to only loan them.", "They blocked you over your mother\u2019s original recipe cards?

Whether OP comments on what recipes are in the final book or not doesn't change who is or isn't the AH for taking the book.

DIL took the recipes and made nice recipe books for everyone.  It was a thoughtful and generous deed.  OP doesn't think the \"right\" recipes are in the book and wants the other recipes.  Nobody has done anything wrong here.  IMO the real solution is for MIL to get together with SIL and add the rest of the recipes to the books.
