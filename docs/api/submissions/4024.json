It just feels more like an ego thing, rather than a sentimental one.", "NTA. Your son's wife is a huge asshole for trying to keep them, no reasonable person would assume they were being given someone else's grandmother's handwritten recipes.", "NTA She made a bizarre assumption thinking you wouldn't want to keep your mother's recipes. Let them take the break and focus on making a book with all the things you want in it", "NTA. You should get to keep the handwritten recipes", "NTA. I don't think she should feel entitled to those. It's not like you gave them to your son. Those are your mother's you deserve them back. I hope she gets them back to you ASAP.", "NTA you are not responsible for anyone else's assumptions. And, frankly, that is a wild one. Why would she assume you wouldn't want YOUR mothers recipes?", "NTA. The gesture was nice, but your dil didn\u2019t even bother to ask what the most popular and well loved recipes to add into the book, and she has no right to keep the hand written copies. She didn\u2019t really know your mother and they weren\u2019t given to her, they were lent to her. There is a big difference. Let your son take a step back, they\u2019re both being ridiculous. I mean your dil didn\u2019t even have the balls to say to your face she was upset.", "NTA\n\nThe gesture of making and sharing the book was very thoughtful. But I would never have assumed I could have the handwritten recipes of someone who was not my biological grandmother and a relatively recent in-law. \n\nIt was an unreasonable assumption I think and it was incumbent on her to ask if she could keep them permanently. She can be upset if she wants, but in what world would you not have wanted your mother\u2019s stuff back unless you explicitly gifted it to her (or it was gifted in a will)?\n\nIf someone who married into the family came to clean my late grandma said, \u201cLook at all these old pictures! I will digitize them for everybody,\u201d I wouldn\u2019t then assume we had given up family photos for them to keep.", "NTA.\n\nDid your DIL actually ask to keep the recipes?  If not, you are not responsible for her assumptions.  Also, I think it was a bit presumptuous of your DIL to think you would not want to have your mother's hand-written recipes.\n\nIf many of your mother's staple recipes weren't included, it would be nice to make sure that everyone gets copies of those as well.  Your DIL did a lovely thing by making the recipe books, but she really didn't know which recipes should have been included if she left out so many favorites.\n\nGive your son and DIL some space for now.  And maybe send a hand-written note to DIL thanking her for her hard work, explaining that the hand-written recipes mean a lot to you  and that you want everyone to share in the recipes, and that you are sorry for any misunderstandings that may have arisen.", "NTA it's your mother's receipts, you had them, you offered them for temporary possession to make the books. I'd just explain that it was a miscommunication, you have nothing against her, but you are keeping your receipts from your mother.", "NTA.\n\nSure there could have been better communication whether from her or you, but she shouldn't have assumed she could keep the originals just because you were nice enough to let her do the project she described to you that you approved of.\n\nLet them take their little break.  They aren't entitled to keep that stuff and should have cleared that with you for sure before assuming as much.", "NTA\n\nThe original recipes have great sentimental value for you and you should have them. DIL is being overly sensitive. \n\nMaybe send her a nice thank you note for making the recipe book and wait for it to blow over.", "Yeah NTA, she had no right to assume she could just keep them", "NTA she's your mother and has nothing to do with DIL in a greater scheme of things, she needs to back off. And your son should know better how would he feel if your stuff when to his kids spouse. Ridiculous.", "NTA Also seems odd that while making the book, she arbitrarily decided which recipes to leave out without checking with anyone.", "NTA. Your DIL is being overly dramatic. Those are your mother's recipes, you get the originals.", "NTA. That was YOUR mother, not hers. If she wanted to keep the recipes, she should have asked and not made it seem like she was borrowing them for the project. \n\nShe isn't entitled to any of your mother's stuff unless you and your siblings agree on it, or if your mother had specified that in a will. Her attitude and your son's attitude are uncalled for.", "NTA. The entitlement of DIL to think she deserves that kind of keepsake is mind blowing. Sounds a bit narcissistic. Ask her why she thinks she should keep YOUR mothers recipes, especially after only being around a few years! Seems like shes trying to keep your son away from the family!", "Nice try, DIL. \n\nThey weren't her's to keep. We had to tell an estranged niece to bring back an old jewelry box full of small momentos. It was part of the estate at that point and she was reminded she could position herself to buy it at the estate sale.", "NTA \n\nWhile what your DIL was a nice, loving gesture, in remembere of your mother, the recipes are yours.\n\nThey are a tie to your loving mother. They are your memories. They are irreplaceable by a book. They are your your mother on her paper, her actual writing, her actual pen. Any actual stain. Each  recipe is a memory of the times that you and your mother prepared it. Each recipe is a memory of your mother's cooking. Each recipe is a memory of your mother's love.\n\nMy mother is 84. She has beginning dementia. She has a lifetime of handwritten recipes.  Most by her mother. Some by my paternal grandmother. Some by other family members. Some by cherished friends. She has kept them in binders for many years. Most are written on cards or scraps of paper. Her recipes are in the binders, as well.\n\nShe doesn't cook now. She let's us do it. She proudly brings out her binders. Finds the recipe that we are to prepare, and tells us stories. About the recipe. About the person and about herself.\n\nPlease share this with your son and daughter in law.\n\nI'm so sorry to learn about your mom's passing. May her recipes bring you a tiny bit of comfort.", "No one said she could keep them does has she bought a trampoline for the conclusion she jumped to?", "Nta\n\n\nFirst from personal experience I know having a close family member handwritten recipes mean to our family. If someone didn't give them back after doing a recipe book we would all be upset. Those stay with you until your ready to give them to one of your children. \n\n\nTheir response is overdramatic and ridiculous. \n\n\nRecipes are a legacy of sorts for some families.  You don't get to be casual about it.\n\n\nGive them space and hopefully they realize how ridiculous they are being.", "NTA why would she think that you, the daughter, wouldn\u2019t want your mother\u2019s recipes back? That was very presumptuous of her to think that she would get to keep them.", "NTA\n\nShe didn't ask to keep them permanently and she had no real reason past making the books for everyone to even handle the recipes. She can't say she wanted them for her memory because she didn't know her that long, especially when she can't fully associate certain dishes to the memory of your mother if she didn't have many of her meals.", "NTA.\n\nYour soon is under the influence of his wife", "NTA, I'm sorry you have to deal with your entitled son and DIL on top all your grief. \n\nI couldn't believe how many things my cousin got of my grandpa's after he passed. He ruined everything he couldn't sell for drugs. My grandma just wouldn't tell him no and now the rest of us are left with almost nothing to remember him by. The man walked me down the aisle when I got married, and my favorite shirt of his was destroyed by cigarette burns and who knows what else.", "NTA\nBut another case of lack of communication. You could have told her beforehand that you want them back. You are definitely not obliged and I don\u2019t feel she is entitled to a non blood relatives heritage but it would have saved you the drama.", "NTA. It's very odd that she didn't actually ask and jumped straight to being offended. They're not her memories.", "Nta - sounds like the DIL assumed and found out she was wrong.", "NTA. I\u2019m not sure anyone is the asshole here. Just some really bad communication. You should speak with her and clear the air.", "NTA\nIf she knew your mom for more than a few years and was close to her then maybe I would understand her wanting to keep the originals but she was your mother and from what it seems like you grew up with those recipes. I think it\u2019s completely unreasonable for them to block you over this instead of being actual adults and talking to you about what she thought they decided to be immature about it. I\u2019m sorry for your loss.", "NTA.\n\nIt was a lovely idea to make recipe books for the family. But it sounds like you lent her those recipes with that specific purpose in mind, so I\u2019m not sure how/why they were misinterpreted to be a gift. \n\nWhile I agree with all of the comments that you could have clearly stated you expected them to be returned, if someone said to me \u201chey, can I use your car to run the store?\u201d, I would expect they return it once they were back from the store. I wouldn\u2019t anticipate they suddenly believe they own my car because I didn\u2019t specify otherwise.z\n\nShe asked for the recipes to make her Christmas gifts, she made them, so the originals should be returned.", "NTA You did nothing wrong. It amazes me the frenzy people work themselves into over other peoples' things. Let them take their break. Fuck em.", "NTA.  Your DIL is allowed to use her head. It\u2019s your mothers handwritten recipes. Of course you want them back. They have emotional value for you.", "NTA. Your DIL created thoughtful gifts for the family, but your own mom's handwritten recipes have a bit of her heart and soul in them. I would never presume to keep what are in effect family heirlooms if I was the DIL. She should return them with an apology for the delay, imho. Your son should realize his wife is overstepping, and request his wife return the recipes to you, and end this unfortunate drama.", "NTA... my Mom's were in index card boxes. Her handwriting, the time, over years,  she spent writing the recipes and making them were important to me. I had them for awhile and now my brothers wife has them. your DIL had them, made special memory books, now they are yours.", "NTA.  There was an obvious lack of communication on your part, you should have told her from the get go that you wanted them back.  That being said, if she was not close to you mother, I find it very odd that she would be that upset by not being allowed to keep the handwritten recipes.", "NTA.  As others have said, there should have been clear communication at the start that you expected to get the original recipes back once the books were done.  I also understand how that was missed at the time though, clearing out a loved one's home after they're gone is hard, even just clearing out for an elder to move to assisted living is emotional!  It just feels like DIL made an incorrect assumption about something precious to you.  She really doesn't have a right to something you treasure, especially since she only knew your mother for such a short time.  Let them have their 'little break', and when you talk to them again, let DIL know how much you appreciate having the original recipe cards back.  Hopefully they will come around.\n\nSuggestion: Put the cards for just the staple & family favorite recipes in an archival binder for you to keep.  Let DIL & other family members take turns choosing from the rest.  Then next year, have booklets made up of the favorites for everyone & let each person pick a favorite original to put in their booklets.  Title it \"Grandmother's Recipes II\", and put a little thank you to DIL for the original idea.", "NAH\n\nSounds like a miscommunication occurred. Would have been better when she first took the recipes to have set out everyone's expectations.", "\"DIL, I want to thank you so much for creating this beautiful tribute to my mother. I so appreciate the time and effort you put into creating this recipe book that we can all now share. I know you only knew my mother during the last few years of her life, but your work has created a lasting tribute. Do let me know if any of the recipes are particularly meaningful to you, so I can earmark those for you, in addition to ones I'll be setting aside for the grandkids\"\n\nNAH. It's often difficult when we lose someone to remember to be kind to the other people who also lost them. Just because the loss is different doesn't mean it isn't still a loss. And it's easy for assumptions to clash if we don't take the time to actually spell them out. So while I tend to agree that the handwritten ones still belong to you, I understand how your DIL could feel disrespected by how you framed the situation.\n\nAfter the thank you and some time to clear the air, I would probably go back to her and suggest a project: \"DIL, you did such a lovely job on the recipe book that I wonder if you would be open to doing another one with me? You see, there are a number of recipes in here that I remember from my childhood, or even just a few years before Mom got sick. I would love a second recipe book that had some of those ones...If I pointed out the ones that are particularly meaningful to me, do you think you could create a second book? That maybe we could give out for Christmas next year?\"", "NAH. It sounds like a miscommunication. She's within her rights to be upset, but you're within your rights to ask for something back that she should not have taken in the first place. Grief has exacerbated the situation. \n\nGive them some time, and maybe give her a copy of them once things have settled.", "NTA I think this was probably a communication issue. You should have been clear that you intended to keep the originals.", "She\u2019s a creep and so is your brother.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
