That was Red Foxx's trademark.\n\nAnd then he died of a massive heart attack while performing, iirc.", "Or Sanford & Son", "I work in a hospital and we get a lot of \u201cchest pains\u201d from people who just arrested and on their way to jail.", "I so miss Red Fox!", "Blessed Sandford and Son", "My boss told me where the stuff were and handled me a price tag thingy and a paper with some prices I had to change, that was all my training lol", "Yep, this is correct. We had a shoplifter one day and all we could do was monitor where they were in the store until the police came. OP is NTA.\n\nBut, definitely OP should also talk to management of their job to find out actual protocols.", "Nah man, ethically the OP had a duty to ensure his safety and the safety of his coworker. He also did not call the police to harm the old man, he called them to ensure his safety and to have this man (who at this point was trespassing) leave. \n\nYou stated that the police could have killed him, well we could play woulda-coulda-shoulda games all day... whos to say a social worker, mental health expert or community care worker would have helped, you certainly don't know that it would have worked and yet you think it's appropriate to shame OP for not thinking of those services?\n\nI think the fact that OP ends his tale by saying the man was arrested clears any idea that the police killed this guy and if the old man got arrested then it means he didn't follow the instructions of the officers after they arrived and instead continued to be a problem for OP and the coworker.\n\nJudging by some of the comments you've made, you're intentionally making the old man out to be a non-threat when you weren't there and you have no idea if he was one. Just because you're an old person that doesn't mean you aren't dangerous so get off your high horse.", " the cops didn't seem worried about his \"medical\" condition, they have probably dealt with him before.", " that man reacted dangerously, age has nothing to do with it!", "It's called incarcer-itis.", "Yeah my FIL is not the sharpest anymore but Lord if he isn't one of the most dangerous people I know. I sincerely would not want to be on the wrong end of his short fuse if I was in a store attending to him. Calling the cops was an act of self preservation without malicious intent.", "Impact is more important than intent. Did OP have the right to call the police? Sure. Could the police have killed that man for doing nothing but being difficult? Sure. Would the death have been OP's fault? No. But a man would still be dead.", "You're right impact is important, but your judgement is based off what could happen instead of what actually happened and you're basing your judgement off of the police killing this guy. It's a fact that we know in this post that the old man was not killed by police so your judgement does not apply accurately here at all. \n\nYou're basically judging OP TA for what could have happened.", "Yes, because death is really permanent. In the end of the day, OP should realize that actions have consequences and one day, someone may die due in part to an action he took. If you're in a position of power (which he is, as police will always side with a store over an individual), it's an assholemove to not educate yourself about what that means and who could be harmed.", "This is probably the most backwards logic I've seen today. You're intentionally twisting the narrative of this situation because you don't like police officers. You're in effect choosing to be inflexible on this stance (which is frankly stupid) and choosing to base your judgement on a series of possibilities when the outcome was already decided. \n\nI'm not going to argue with you anymore, it's quite clear that you won't be moved on this stance and I don't want to waste time on this anymore.", "It's a waste of time to try engaging with adults who can't navigate nuance. B&W/Hardline thinking is a tell of inability to think critically & bc they feel some sense of moral superiority about that, have no curiosity to investigate any issue further.", "I\u2019m not. I just think you\u2019re a self righteous hypocrite. \n\nYou won\u2019t use the police unless it directly affects you. \n\nYou want op to put themself in danger so that the old man might not get hurt by someone not doing their job correctly. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re logic is sound or based in realty. \n\nThese directly contradict themselves."]}
