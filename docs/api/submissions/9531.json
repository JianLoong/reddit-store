I tried to calm him down, told him that maybe it fell from his pocket and I'll help him find it but he was not having it. He started to yell at me too, so I told my coworker to call the cops. When they came (quite quickly) the man (who I forgot to add was old) started grabbing his chest and telling the cops that we were trying to steal from him, and he also demanded to get his stuff for free because we stole his money. The police arrested him.\n\nI feel very shitty tbh, my friend also told me that if he was old I could've just kick him out which is true, maybe calling the police on him was too much.
