Also it\u2019s not something you ever get over!", "YTA.\nThe grieving never ends when a parent loses a child. You can only come to terms with it.\nYou are an Ahole for expecting this man to throw out some of his daughters things.....it and the memories are all he has left.\nHe needs therapy to help him deal with the grief.\nBut it is entirely up to him when he decides to do anything to his daughters room.", "To your specific question, **NTA** for thinking your daughter should get the room.\r  \n\r  \nHowever you are TA for either marrying the wrong guy or failing to plan what happens when you move in together.\r  \n\r  \nYou should have talked about and agreed on the living arrangements *before* you got married.", "YTA.\n\nThis isn't how you handle someone who is still dealing with such deep grief. \n\n\"I think it's ridiculous\" is incredibly callous and hurtful. \n\nTo him, you are erasing what he has left of her and don't care about his feelings (I suspect). \n\n\"Just enough so both girls have their own room.\" - you still have your children, and he's probably still grappling with what it means to have daughters in the house again.\n\nIf he reacted in the way he did, COME ON. That should tell you that you need to figure out a more compassionate, nay, you weren't compassionate before, way to handle this. \n\nAlso, how TF have you been together this long and never discussed to a point of joint resolution?!", "Unfortunately, there is no set timeline for grief.  No one can tell you the right amount of time it takes.  And everyone reacts differently.  How did his daughter die?  If it was sudden and traumatic, that matters.  Right now, that is his physical connection.  He may need help working through it but there is no right way to force him into it.", "A very soft YTA\n\nIt's pretty damned obvious that he's not gotten through his grief over losing his child, and even suggesting he discard any of her things is pretty insensitive.\n\nDoubling down on how long is what really pushes this over the line.\n\nYou should totally apologize to him and admit your fault, then let it rest for a while.", "Grief has no set expiry date. His grief will last his lifetime, and any attempt to rush that process into a new stage will not work out well for you, as you have found out.\n\nYou are applying logic and reason to a situation that is not bound by logic or reason. You're gonna need to stop doing that, lest you run the risk of becoming an asshole.\n\nNAH (***yet***).", "ESH. How did this not come up before getting married and deciding to move in together? \n\nThis is the result of poor communication and assumptions made on both sides.", "NTA, but now you know that he is still hurting and hasn't healed from the loss of his daughter. I think you two can rock this out with time and patience.", "ESH! I do not think that you are the AH for thinking your daughter should get the room. You\u2019re right\u2026 he needs to move on and can\u2019t expect to keep a room like that forever.  HOWEVER, the fact that you didn\u2019t even seem to discuss living arrangements prior to moving in, is absurd. You can\u2019t expect him to want to change overnight and the lack of communication is concerning.\n\nYour husband is also the AH for making 2 teenagers share a room when there is clearly enough room for each to have their own individual space, but refuses to make changes. While I agree that losing a child is a horrific trauma, he can\u2019t expect to keep her room like that forever, or if he does, he should have mentioned that to you before moving in. It sounds like he needs some therapy and needs to do a little work to help him move on. What\u2019s the point of keeping the room for no one\u2019s use?\n\nY\u2019all have major communication problems.", "**NTA**   It's true that there is no expiry date on grief.    It's also true that the quality of your present depends on prioritizing the living.   Maintaining a shrine to his dead daughter was never a healthy path for grief.\n\nI'm constantly surprised to read how couple decide to blend families with a big elephant like this in the room without premarital counseling.  If he won't agree to counseling, you really need some individual counseling to explore how much of your daughters' life you are willing to sacrifice for his dead daughter.   Do you expect them to live forever in her shadow?", "NTA But why on earth did you not discuss this before you moved in? \n\nThe lack of forethought at times is staggering when all the signs are there", "YTA. I think your request can be the beginning of the end of your marriage. Grieve is a process that doesn't end after a couple of months or years. Judging from my experience having something around from a deceased loved one that remains part of your everday life is a great level of comfort for many people.\n\nYes it would be nice if both of your daughters could have their own rooms. But in my opinion your husbands ability to feel connected to his daughter in this house is more important. I think it would be best to apologize to your husband and look for an alternative solution. Is there an attic or basement you can convert to another bedroom? Or maybe the master bedroom could be turned into two bedrooms. But whatever happens to the daughter's bedroom is solely on you husband's schedule.", "ESH.  This really should have been discussed before you moved in.  You may want to consider other housing for yourself and your daughters", "YTA\n\nThe grief of losing a child never ends. It just changes shape to fit each new day. His grief is not on a timetable. The fact that you have children and can't emphasize with that is unfortunate. I'd apologize, whole heartedly.", "ESH, he's still grieving. Somebody can grieve for 5 days or 20 years, there's no timeline. That room is the last part of her he has. It's a bit insensitive for you to say that. But at the same time, he didn't have to say those things to you and was mean on his part. I get he was upset, but those are some harsh things to say\nSo yes, everyone sucks here.", "This is a sensitive issue, and it's clear that emotions are running high on both sides. From your point of view, it seems practical to use the available space in the house so that both of your daughters can have their own rooms. Your husband, however, sees his late daughter's room as a sacred space to honor her memory, and any suggestion of changing it might feel like a betrayal to him.\n\nYou're not necessarily an \"asshole\" for wanting to make practical use of the space, especially when it benefits your daughters. However, the timing and manner in which this was approached could be seen as insensitive given the emotional weight that room holds for your husband.\n\nMarriage often requires compromise, especially in blended families where everyone is adjusting to new dynamics. This situation may call for professional intervention, such as couples' counseling, to mediate and help you both find a resolution that respects both his need to memorialize and your daughters' need for their own spaces.\n\nUnderstanding, compromise, and clear communication are essential here. It's a difficult situation, and there are valid feelings on both sides.", "Has he had any counseling for his grief?  Parents never really heal but there is support. Keeping her room might be his only outlet for keeping her 'alive' for him.  It's a hard topic. I'm going to say NAH...\n\nI understand your frustration but you need to be supportive while broaching the topic. It will never be just a room to him.\n\nedit: typos", "Yta. You knew it was there before you even got together, let alone moved in. \nGrief is a long process and you should be supporting him to move on. Not pushing him in his own home.\nYou've only been married a few months..", "NTA, but i'm sure even after all this time, the death of his daughter is still very hard for him. If your goal is to have that room be used for one of your daughters, maybe try approaching it in a different way. Instead of suggesting to just *get rid of* her items, maybe just pack things up to put away elsewhere for now. Also maybe he can pick out some special items to go in a shadowbox somewhere in the house or on a shelf as a tribute to her. He's clearly not in a place where he's ready to let go of items yet, but maybe if you work *with* him and support him in his grief, he can at least get the room ready for one of your daughter's to use.", "NTA - But this is a toughie, but I think you are right.  It would be far healthier for him to move with his grief over his daughter after 8 years as there can be other ways to still honor her memory and your daughters need to be considered by him as needing their own rooms at this point.  But really a tough call.", "NAH the real solution is to move to a new home that isn't your husband's turf. You need neutral ground to establish yourselves as a family unit.", "YTA.  He has made a mistake marrying you, exactly as he says.  You will not win this.  Your kids will just have to share or you accept the fact that your marriage is over and go back to an apartment with them.", "NTA in principle, and he's still grieving, so you'll need to ease him into the idea over some time.", "YTA \n\n\nIn the 5 years you've been dating, you knew what that room was. He definitely needs therapy to help him deal with his grief, but, this is what the room has been.\n\n\nYou waited until you were married and your kids were already living there, sharing a room, to address it. Sounds like you knew he'd say no beforehand, so you didn't talk about it. Sounds like you just wanted to get out of the apartment and into a bigger space.\n\n\nYou wouldn't have been the AH if you talked about it with him. That, when you live together, you want your daughters to have their own rooms. That what happened to his daughter is horrible, and you want to be supportive, but also think there are ways to honor her memory, while not keeping the room as a shrine. And encourage therapy/grief counseling. And, that could have been the end of the relationship and it would have been a N A H situation. Although hopefully it could have been something you work through together.\n\n\nBut you just wanted to put him in a position where it was harder to say no. Why did you agree to your daughters sharing a room to begin with?", "NTA.  Although, sitting here in front of a computer, it's difficult to tell how this came across from you.  Of course you can ask about it.  That doesn't make you an asshole.  I would let it go.  I do think, however, you should suggest he maybe see a professional.  He most likely needs to talk through this.  I don't think its too terribly healthy to keep the room as is.  But he does need to do it on his timeline.", "YTA - You knew he had issues regarding his healing/mourning process even before you got married, why wait until now to change things? Before you got married and even moved in together, this should\u2019ve been discussed.", "He's right. He did make a mistake marrying you.\n\nYTA", "YTA", "NTA. He needs to take that issue up with his therapist and not take it out on his wife.", "Yta, you should\u2019ve just waited for him to offer it.", "YTA. you think his grief is, using your word, \u201cridiculous\u201d. That\u2019s so harsh and unkind. Do you love him or just need housing?", "YTA. \n\nYou absolutely should have discussed this before you married him. The reason you\u2019re TA is because how he deals with grief & his timeline for packing up his daughter\u2019s room is intensely personal; the fact that you think it\u2019s ridiculous is a problem. Do you honestly believe your marriage would change how he viewed his daughter\u2019s room? I mean, it\u2019s been that way for 8 years\u2026 the fact that you dated him for 5 of them & seem clueless about it makes me think he may be right about having made a mistake.", "nta. At this point you should tell him nevermind, and that you and your daughters will look for a place to live, without him.", "They don\u2019t need their own room, it would be nice, but your husband gets to grieve in his own way.\n\nYour daughters aren\u2019t going to replace the child he lost, just remember that.", "NTA, Asking the question does not make you an asshole. You do have to respect his answer though.  Others are saying grief has no time limit, which is true. It's also true that everyone handles it in different ways.  I would not keep a whole room but rather have another way to honour a loss, but that's me. You would likely do something different as well. \nPeople need to be able to learn to function through their grief. Not let it go, but not let it control their life. From the sounds of your husbands reaction, I'd say he has not reached that balance point. Which is also fine. You could encourage him to talk to someone to help him cope better with the loss. This is not a way for you to get him to move the daughters things, he may not be ever ready to do that.", "NTA \n\nIf he doesn't want to let one of the others use the room, then you and him move into the living room and give your bedroom to one of the girls, or even move if you can afford it.", "***YTA   You are so cold.   He made a mistake marrying you.   Why would you marry someone  you don't respect?       It should be instinct to comfort someone you love.   Doubt you ever loved him though.

Not for wanting your daughters to each have their own room, but for suggesting your husband get rid of his daughter's stuff. Grief never goes away, no matter what anyone says.

It would be a nice compromise, but you went about it total wrong.", "Yta \nHe can go into that room and see a piece of his dead  child and you want to throw her away", "YTA omg his daughter died!!!! And you are busy plotting to rip apart the poor dead girls room. 8 years is nothing compared to the loss of a child. Why don\u2019t you think about how lucky you are to be living in a house at all.

Sounds like he is not ready to move forward with you and your children In his life. The dead child is still taking center stage and is the priority. This should of been discussed before marriage. Why would you bring children into a home that is still a shrine to the dead? The people commenting here that seem to think it is normal to live in an eternal shrine to the dead creep me out.", "This is a tough one OP\u2026 Grief for a child is so painful. I can\u2019t imagine what he is going through and there is no timeline when one should get over it as some just learn to cope with it and go on with their daily lives.\nIt\u2019s not healthy to keep a shrine as it\u2019s harder to move on from the grief or to lessen the pain.  What he needs is a grief counsellor or therapist who can help him.  Then slowly he can take pieces of his daughters room and put them in storage,donate other pieces, give away some of her things to family members as a token of her memory.  Keep a few in a special place in the home so he can have access too.  Then he can close that door of his daughter room and open it up for one of your daughters to take it.  But it might take a bit of time but it will require patience and help.  \nYou need to have a kind conversation with him about being open to getting grief counselling and see what he says.  Also if you able to sit with him in these sessions if they offer so you can best support him.\nThe worse outcome is innocently one of your daughters might bring up wanting the room for themselves and he has a big blow up.  It won\u2019t be fair to the girls as they don\u2019t understand grief so it\u2019s a good thing for you all to attend and support him.  Then when he is ready you will have a room for your girl. If it doesn\u2019t work out be prepared, to either move on and get a bigger place and he can still have his daughters room but in a different location, but if he is adamant and won\u2019t get help then you have to decide what do you want to do going forward.

Obviously the OP is being insensitive about this, horribly so. But, it's been eight years. I get that grief never goes away, and it makes sense that he doesn't want to throw away her stuff. But, he has three daughters now, and two are alive and would be better off using that space. Maybe he could put it in storage? Not right away, but slowly, so that maybe once both kids are teens/later teens the space will be open enough for one of them to move in. He probably will never move on because that's not something you can move on from, but keeping a whole room for eight years and not considering moving things for one of your new daughters just isn't logical. \n\nI don't know how they haven't talked about this, it's a really important conversation that should have been had sooner.", "I agree with ESH. Both OP and husband should have had this figured out before they got married and moved in together. I can't believe they've been a couple for 5 years.
