Yes, someone is paying to rent that space & can certainly set & enforce some rules, but it doesn't give them free rein to do whatever they want to the property. That's why renters have to pay security deposits, so if they don't keep the property in the condition the owner wants it kept in, the owner doesn't have to foot the bill all by themselves to change/fix things.", "By you, or by anyone?
