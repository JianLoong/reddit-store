Ben and Cassie have been together for 3 years and are talking about getting engaged. We\u2019re all very happy for them.\n\nHowever Ben believes that Josh should be entitled some money in a trust from my grandfather\u2019s estate, in the same way Henry received. His argument is that Josh and Henry have been in our family for the same amount of time, and Josh shouldn\u2019t be penalised for not being his biological child. \n\nHe brought this up at a family meal on Sunday. A mix of other family members were also there. I told Ben that I disagreed with him, that Henry and Josh are entitled to different things, at least until Ben were to adopt Josh someday or he and Cassie marry. That my grandfather may have known both children for the same amount of time but you couldn\u2019t expect him base his will on that fact, and that this is all moot because my grandfather\u2019s estate was his to split and what\u2019s done is done.\n\nBen said I\u2019m insensitive to the position he is in, looking after another man\u2019s child and becoming a father in a more challenging way. Again I said none of that really matters in this because it\u2019s not about morality but financial practicality. Ben accused me of suggesting his family is worth less than our sister\u2019s. I told him that of course that isn\u2019t true, but it was inappropriate to bring this up at a family meal and that our sister would at least know better than to disrespect my grandfather\u2019s memory by discussing his estate at the table.\n\nBen finished his meal in silence but when he left on he said I\u2019d been rude, I\u2019d made him uncomfortable and I should have his back when it comes to these sorts of issues.

If its such an issue, he could give some of the money he gets, to Josh.", "The only appropriate person that can answer this question is now 6 feet under.  The estate of the deceased has spoken and conveyed its wishes as to where and to whom its earthly possessions should be distributed.  it was grandfather's choice as to who his heirs should be.\n\nBen is a bit absurd to beleive that the son of a woman he has ben dating for only three years should be entitled to a portion of his grandfather's estate.  Ask Ben that when the stepson's grabdfather or father dies, will your blood relatives benefit and be named as heirs to those estates?\n\nYou werent rude, you were practical and matter of fact.  The boy is not family, Ben is not married to his girlfriend and the boy is not entitled to a cut of grandpa's estate.  If Ben feels so strongly, then he can give the boy a cut but it comes out of his own pocket.    NTA", "You are NTA and everything you said is \ud83d\udcaf correct. People do stupid stuff around estate money. Tell Ben he is free to not spend any of his share of the estate on himself and use it to set up a trust fund for his stepson if he wants because that is his money. He has no say in anyone else\u2019s money.", "NTA  Josh is not your brother's stepson, he's your brother's gf's son - when and if they get married makes him his stepson - they arent even engaged. Thinking your grandfather should have left a trust fund for a child that isn't a member of the family is absurd. If your brother feels that strongly he should take part of his inheritance and set up a trust for the child - I notice in your brother's  opinion its only unfair if it's not coming out of his pocket.", "NTA no one is entitled to your grandpa\u2019s money. Grandpa was (presumably) of sound mind and distributed his money as he saw fit.", "NTA I agree with you, you are not wrong.\n\n1. you brother was wrong to bring that up at the dinner table.\n2. Your grandfather's estate is his to split as  he please, he can give it all to his neighbor's cat if he wanted to.\n3. Ben is not married and has not adopted josh. josh is not even part of the family yet. (and even if he had married cassie and adopted josh, your grandfather can still opt to not give him anything because that is his money!)", "I love that your brother wants to defend his stepson. And I'm glad he's a good sounding board for you. Your grandfather wrote the will that he wanted executed and the way he wanted it executed. I agree with respecting that. You're sounding bored is wrong on this one. NTA", "NTA, it was your grandfather's money to do what he wanted with.  And he brought it up", "NTA. Josh is not a member of the family. Tell Ben to take a portion of his inheritance and put it into a trust for Josh if he feels so strongly about it.", "NTA - What about any other children born after Grandpa passed away? Your has not legally brought his girlfriend or her son into the family and your Grandfather was actually protecting your brother by no including her son inhis will.", "NTA.  Your brother Ben should know the reason his girlfriend's stepson was excluded from the will.  It's the same reason that he hasn't married this lady despite having been with her for three years. If he hasn't even brought himself to make a lifetime commitment to this woman after spending three years with her, how can he expect his grandfather to bequeath his assets on her child when he barely even knows them?  By that same token, how can he accuse you of devaluing his \"family\" when he's the one who's stalled on actually making them his family for so long?", "NTA, legally speaking Josh is nothing to your grandfather, but even if that weren't the case he wouldn't be entitled to anything. It was up to your grandfather to divide his assets as he saw fit, hence the whole last will and testament thing. I think your borther is just jealous/greedy, but he's smart enough to know that's a bad look so he's hiding behind this preceived \"injustice\".", "NTA: If Ben and Cassie were married then he'd have an argument to make. But your grandfather had no obligation to establish a trust for your brother's girlfriend's kid.\n\nIf Ben is so adamant that Josh should get part of the inheritance in a trust tell him to take some of his money and create a trust for Josh.", "NTA. You are absolutely right, Josh and Henry have not been in your family for the same amount of time because Josh is not in your family. Your brother hasn't adopted him, hasn't married Cassie, he hasn't even proposed. \n\nThey could get in a fight, break up tomorrow, and all she'd have to do is pack her stuff. Your grandfather was right to not leave Josh an inheritance. \n\nBut that's moot because no one is entitled to be in someone's will.", "NTA at all! First of all I agree with you that they aren\u2019t married. It\u2019s not about Josh being biological or not, he isn\u2019t even a step sin at this point. Secondly and MOST importantly, your grandfather can leave money to anyone he chooses. It\u2019s HIS choice! He could leave any one of you out if he wanted to and it\u2019s up to him, it doesn\u2019t have to be fair.", "NTA.  Your grandfather could have left all of his money to the circus.  His money, his decision.  He chose not to leave money in trust for a child that is not part of his biological family.   What it right?  Was it wrong?  Who cares, its done and cannot be undone.  It is also pretty common TBH.", "NTA.\n\nYour brother can set up a trust for Josh if it's so important to him.  Your grandfather had no obligation to gift Josh the same as Henry.  Ben's position would be more understandable if he'd adopted Josh, but he did not, or he wouldn't be a stepson. As much as the boys might be equal family in your brother's eyes, that doesn't have to be the same for your grandfather and quite clearly wasn't.   Josh is not being \"penalized\" at all, he's simply not recognized by your grandfather as one of his progeny.  And that is his right.  \n\nYou were correct that your brother was being inappropriate and disrespectful to complain.  When it's his money, he can decide.  He doesn't get to decide how other people spend theirs though.", "NTA - As your said, it's your grandfather's will and he did what he did.", "NTA - If your brother has not taken steps to make his relationship with Cassie or Josh legally or financially binding, why does he expect other people to take steps to legally or financially recognize his relationship to them?\n\nI might think differently if your brother and Cassie were against the idea of traditional marriage and considered themselves to already be as bound together as a couple as they can be. But if they are thinking about getting engaged in the future, that means that they do see another step that their relationship can and may take, but that they haven't gotten to the point where they are ready for that yet.", "NTA your grandfather money is his to decide.   No matter if you agree or disagree and it is distasteful to bring up a gift that is given in a will as that is what it is. If your brothers wants some money in a trust he can take a portion he was left and put it aside.   \n\nThis is why I am firm advocate for leaving it to the pet charities at least they do not put up their hands and stomp feet going I want more or a bigger share they are grateful for the warm bed, food and cuddles & affection the real gift in the world.", "Josh has two parents, one (or possibly two stepparents), and four grandparents that can provide for him financially. He was not your grandfather's relative or responsibility to provide for. They were only dating. Ben can take the money he received from the estate and put into a trust for Josh if he so desires. NTA", "Nta-long and the short your grandfather left his wishes in a will it was his choice", "NTA. Ben's fiance's son is not a relative in the sense that they're not even engaged, let alone married. Ben is to be commended for stepping up as a step parents but Ben's fiance's son may well one day inherit something from his mom's side of the family or even his biological dad's side of the family. If he does, are the other kids on your side of the family entitled to a cut of that?", "NTA. \n\nGpa dictated his will how he wanted his will.  If anyone is upset about it, take it up with the dead guy. The living shouldn't suffer for the choices of the departed.", "NTA. Ben's stepson isn't actually a stepson yet and your grandfather has a right to decide who he leaves money to. Ben has no right to ask you to give up some of your cut. He can give up some of his own if he wants.", "NTA\n\nHonestly, no one is entitled to anyone\u2019s estate. \n\nHe could have donated everything away or just given it to only children (your mother,aunts,uncles,etc)", "NTA\n\nYou are 100% correct, it was your Grandfathers estate and he may split it as he willed...", "NTA You are right what's done is done. If your grandfather didn't leave Josh any money it's because he didn't want him to have his money. Henry was born into the family and Josh has yet to become a member. Ben and Cassie aren't married and Ben hasn't even adopted Josh yet. If Ben wants people to view Josh as family then he should take the step to make him family.", "NTA - but arguing about it is completely pointless. Your grandfather has passed. You cannot change the will.\n\nIf ben feels that his step son deserves some of the money, then he can use the money that was gifted to himself from the will.", "NTA", "NTA They may have been together for 3 yrs, but they\u2019re not married nor engaged.", "NTA...i understand his feelings but it's your grandfather's will.\n\nMy nephew got everything with his mum, my mum, me and my brother didn't get Jack .\nI don't give a damn because I did not have a good relationship with her.\n\nMy brother has an stepdaughter but i know for sure that if something happened to my parents she isn't getting a thing.\nIt's not that they don't like or love her but she's not their granddaughter and has other people around her who can leave her in their will. She's always treated the same btw. \n\nProbably your grandfather thought something like that.", "It was your grandfather\u2019s money and his choice on what he did with it. He wrote the Will because he didn\u2019t want these decisions to be made by someone else. Leave it at that. Also, nothing stops your brother from passing his share to his stepson.", "NTA. It's telling that in the same breath, Ben complains about people allegedly not seeing Josh as family, while also referring to \"raising another man's child\" (which is quite a resentful framing of the situation). It feels like there's more to the story, but at minimum Ben needs to sort out his feelings about his relationship with the gf and child.", "Wouldn't this be dictated by the will? Who is the executor?", "NTA", "NTA.     When was the will written ?  \nMaybe grandfather updated it when Henry was a new baby.   \nMaybe Cassie wasn't around yet., or she was new to the family .", "NTA. Why would your grandfather be expected to include your brother's girlfriend's son in his will? Knowing someone for a period of time does not qualify you for inheritance. Technically, I've known my neighbours' kids for longer than my son. That doesn't mean I'm going to write them into my will!", ">Ben said I\u2019m insensitive to the position he is in, l**ooking after another man\u2019s child** and becoming a father in a more challenging way. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd this is EXACTLY the reason why your grandfather did not include the child. And as much as I feel like the kid is innocent in this, his step-dad hit the nail on the head on why some people (including himself apperantly!?!) do not think they have a blood bond.\n\nSeriously, that is a f- up'ed think to say while at the same time claiming that the kid is the same as the rest of the family.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA. If your grandfather had a grandfather relationship with Josh on an equal level with Henry, then I might see how it felt unfair but I'm not getting the feeling that this is the case. And you are right, done is done, there is nothing that can be changed. If it is that important, why doesn't Ben put his part into a trust for Josh?", "NTA. You made him uncomfortable? He brought this up out in the open at a family dinner lol. Your brother doesnt seem that sensible to me and seems to be lacking class. At the end of the day its a inheritance. If he wants to peater everyone in the family about this, let him make an ass of himself. Any idea if his wife is talking in his ear and that's why he's dragging this limp argument of his?", "NTA", "NTA. Your brother made a choice to raise another man's child, which is admirable, BUT that doesn't mean the future stepson is entitled to anyone else's money or inheritance. It was your grandpa's decision to divvy out his money the way he wanted.", "NAH. I think Ben was trying to tell you all that he considers Josh to be his son and he wants his family to treat him that way. Your grandpa is no longer with us so there\u2019s nothing you can do about the will. The best way to resolve this is to assure Ben that Cassie and Josh will be treated as equal family members. You also need to keep in mind that families are built differently now. What if Cassie and Ben decide to stay together but never marry? Will your family treat Ben differently from Henry just because his mother and step father made the decision not to get married? This is something that your family needs to be in the same page about.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
