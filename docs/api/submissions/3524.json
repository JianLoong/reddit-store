Ben and Cassie have been together for 3 years and are talking about getting engaged. We\u2019re all very happy for them.\n\nHowever Ben believes that Josh should be entitled some money in a trust from my grandfather\u2019s estate, in the same way Henry received. His argument is that Josh and Henry have been in our family for the same amount of time, and Josh shouldn\u2019t be penalised for not being his biological child. \n\nHe brought this up at a family meal on Sunday. A mix of other family members were also there. I told Ben that I disagreed with him, that Henry and Josh are entitled to different things, at least until Ben were to adopt Josh someday or he and Cassie marry. That my grandfather may have known both children for the same amount of time but you couldn\u2019t expect him base his will on that fact, and that this is all moot because my grandfather\u2019s estate was his to split and what\u2019s done is done.\n\nBen said I\u2019m insensitive to the position he is in, looking after another man\u2019s child and becoming a father in a more challenging way. Again I said none of that really matters in this because it\u2019s not about morality but financial practicality. Ben accused me of suggesting his family is worth less than our sister\u2019s. I told him that of course that isn\u2019t true, but it was inappropriate to bring this up at a family meal and that our sister would at least know better than to disrespect my grandfather\u2019s memory by discussing his estate at the table.\n\nBen finished his meal in silence but when he left on he said I\u2019d been rude, I\u2019d made him uncomfortable and I should have his back when it comes to these sorts of issues.

If he hasn't even brought himself to make a lifetime commitment to this woman after spending three years with her, how can he expect his grandfather to bequeath his assets on her child when he barely even knows them?  By that same token, how can he accuse you of devaluing his \"family\" when he's the one who's stalled on actually making them his family for so long?", "NTA, legally speaking Josh is nothing to your grandfather, but even if that weren't the case he wouldn't be entitled to anything. It was up to your grandfather to divide his assets as he saw fit, hence the whole last will and testament thing.

First of all I agree with you that they aren\u2019t married. It\u2019s not about Josh being biological or not, he isn\u2019t even a step sin at this point.

It is also pretty common TBH.", "NTA.\n\nYour brother can set up a trust for Josh if it's so important to him.  Your grandfather had no obligation to gift Josh the same as Henry.

As much as the boys might be equal family in your brother's eyes, that doesn't have to be the same for your grandfather and quite clearly wasn't.   Josh is not being \"penalized\" at all, he's simply not recognized by your grandfather as one of his progeny.  And that is his right.  \n\nYou were correct that your brother was being inappropriate and disrespectful to complain.  When it's his money, he can decide.

But if they are thinking about getting engaged in the future, that means that they do see another step that their relationship can and may take, but that they haven't gotten to the point where they are ready for that yet.", "NTA your grandfather money is his to decide.   No matter if you agree or disagree and it is distasteful to bring up a gift that is given in a will as that is what it is. If your brothers wants some money in a trust he can take a portion he was left and put it aside.   \n\nThis is why I am firm advocate for leaving it to the pet charities at least they do not put up their hands and stomp feet going I want more or a bigger share they are grateful for the warm bed, food and cuddles & affection the real gift in the world.", "Josh has two parents, one (or possibly two stepparents), and four grandparents that can provide for him financially.

If your grandfather didn't leave Josh any money it's because he didn't want him to have his money. Henry was born into the family and Josh has yet to become a member.

If Ben wants people to view Josh as family then he should take the step to make him family.", "NTA - but arguing about it is completely pointless. Your grandfather has passed.

It's telling that in the same breath, Ben complains about people allegedly not seeing Josh as family, while also referring to \"raising another man's child\" (which is quite a resentful framing of the situation).

Who is the executor?", "NTA", "NTA.     When was the will written ?  \nMaybe grandfather updated it when Henry was a new baby.   \nMaybe Cassie wasn't around yet., or she was new to the family .", "NTA. Why would your grandfather be expected to include your brother's girlfriend's son in his will? Knowing someone for a period of time does not qualify you for inheritance. Technically, I've known my neighbours' kids for longer than my son. That doesn't mean I'm going to write them into my will!", ">Ben said I\u2019m insensitive to the position he is in, l**ooking after another man\u2019s child** and becoming a father in a more challenging way. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd this is EXACTLY the reason why your grandfather did not include the child. And as much as I feel like the kid is innocent in this, his step-dad hit the nail on the head on why some people (including himself apperantly!?!) do not think they have a blood bond.\n\nSeriously, that is a f- up'ed think to say while at the same time claiming that the kid is the same as the rest of the family.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA. If your grandfather had a grandfather relationship with Josh on an equal level with Henry, then I might see how it felt unfair but I'm not getting the feeling that this is the case. And you are right, done is done, there is nothing that can be changed. If it is that important, why doesn't Ben put his part into a trust for Josh?", "NTA. You made him uncomfortable? He brought this up out in the open at a family dinner lol. Your brother doesnt seem that sensible to me and seems to be lacking class. At the end of the day its a inheritance. If he wants to peater everyone in the family about this, let him make an ass of himself. Any idea if his wife is talking in his ear and that's why he's dragging this limp argument of his?", "NTA", "NTA. Your brother made a choice to raise another man's child, which is admirable, BUT that doesn't mean the future stepson is entitled to anyone else's money or inheritance. It was your grandpa's decision to divvy out his money the way he wanted.", "NAH. I think Ben was trying to tell you all that he considers Josh to be his son and he wants his family to treat him that way. Your grandpa is no longer with us so there\u2019s nothing you can do about the will. The best way to resolve this is to assure Ben that Cassie and Josh will be treated as equal family members. You also need to keep in mind that families are built differently now. What if Cassie and Ben decide to stay together but never marry? Will your family treat Ben differently from Henry just because his mother and step father made the decision not to get married?

Kid is not his step son. He's his gf's son.\n\nI'm betting grandpa made his choice based on that. Did grandpa even know the kid?", "NTA.  Ben is beyond wrong.  There is NO family relationship with Josh.  They aren't even married!  Even if they were, Josh was not your grandfather's relative.  Perhaps if Ben and Cassie had been married for some time and he adopted Josh the story would be different but that's not what happened.  He asking for the family to give a GIRLFRIEND's kid family money.  Hell no.", "NTA.  Josh hasn't been \"part of the family\" for 3 years - he met your brother 3 years ago. I don't think it's weird that your grandfather would see a grandkid differently than a kid who *might someday* become a grandkid (they still aren't engaged, just \"talking about it\"). Like, Ben isn't even 100% that he's gonna marry this lady, why would grandpa assume that Josh would still even be in contact with any of Ben's family 12 years from now?\n\nIf your brother wanted his grandpa to treat Josh and his mom like family, he should have made them his family while grandpa was still around.", "Nta. Incredibly rational people are not immune to being irrational when it affects them directly.  He\u2019s not being rational now at all. He\u2019s giving in to his base emotions like a hormonal teenager.", "NTA", "NTA.  They are not married so technically Josh is not even his stepson. Why would he expect your grandfather to leave money to a child is in legal way a relation?", "NTA. They aren\u2019t married, aren\u2019t engaged. It would be different if your brother had adopted. \n\nCassie could dump him tomorrow and y\u2019all would never see that kid again. Similarly if he ends the relationship, he has no responsibility for this child. He\u2019s not a father, even if he loves the kid.", "NTA, lmao your brother is wild. This kid isn\u2019t his \u201cstepson,\u201d he\u2019s just his girlfriend\u2019s child. Marriage isn\u2019t necessarily required to make someone \u201cfamily,\u201d but also your brother hasn\u2019t adopted this kid or anything, so I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about. How would the grandpa know if this relationship would even last? Barring any actual titles, what\u2019s to stop the relationship from ending and then this random kid getting an inheritance when he\u2019s 18?", "NTA. Grandfather's money and he made the call. If Ben is worried about Josh, he should share his portion.", "NTA, they aren't even married, the entitlement is real.  Your brother got his share and can use that to help raise his stepson.", "NTA - Just because he didn\u2019t like what you said didn\u2019t mean you were rude or out of line.", "NTA. Your brother is not even married to his girlfriend. That is the end of the discussion. Even if he was, the stepson wouldn't be entitled to any money unless his step grandfather willed it to him.", "NTA.  He's uncomfortable because he put himself in that position.  It was your grandfather's estate and his to do with as he pleased.  Ben can share his portion with Josh.", "NTA, if Ben wants Josh to have some money, Ben is capable of taking the inheritance they got, and putting it in a trust for Josh.   \n    \nWhat Ben wants is for the rest of the people to fund the child they have decided to take on responsibility for.", " Ben can put some money in trust for his definitely not stepkid if he wants. NTA.", "Not to mention, grandpa didn't leave any money to potential grandchildren!! /s  Josh isn't officially a member of the family, and yes, this matters to some people. I'm not saying it's necessarily right, just that it matters. And no one gets to dictate how grandpa left his money.", "Aside from the relationship status, the grandfather probably thought the stepson already has two sets of his biological grandparents and biological parents to provide for him.  Ben is acting entitled.", "this is the wildest fuckin take\u2026 three years is not that long of a time, that\u2019s nearly just the entire pandemic\u2026 like that\u2019s not a whole lot of time dude?", "Might want to edit the child's name here. Henry is OP's sister's son. Ben's not-yet-stepson is Josh.", "I mean I wouldn't leave money to someone who has no familial ties to me either.  They aren't even married (or in a life long committed marriage like relationship).  For all grandpa knows, they could break up at any time and the kid would have 0 ties to the family.   If he was adopted or they had been married a long time I'd get the hurt, but this kid isn't even a stepkid.", "My grandfather would agree and actually left a rather sizeable donation to an owl charity.", ">we will value his family less because it wasn\u2019t built in the traditional way\n\nYour GF valued his family less because this isn't a family. Ben is not even engaged, much less married. I have to wonder, if Ben hasn't proposed to a person he's been with for 3 years and played Daddy to her son, why hasn't he proposed?\n\nFuture conversations around should be you asking him why he hasn't made Cassie and Josh family, instead of why you don't give his GF's son money.", "I mean, they are not family YET. They aren\u2019t even engaged.", "Then why act like it\u2019s enough time to put someone in a will? If they were married it\u2019d be a little different. But now they have no legal ties. What if Ben and the gf break up? Nta.", "Thanks for pointing that out - done!", "I agree, Ben hasn't adopted Josh yet. If he had Grandpa might have changed the will.", "oh hell no i wasn\u2019t suggesting that just saying that it\u2019s wild to suggest that just knowing each other since the pandemic was A LONG TIME"]}
