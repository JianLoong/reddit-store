Were the pants too tight?", "While I understand your frustration about the clothing, it seems to me like your reaction was way over the top. We do get criticism at work sometimes and have to be able to deal with that without coming undone. I guess your coworkers had to work extra hard that day, they might think it was an AH move. I will say you are NTA but need to be evaluate your reaction so you can be more resilient in the future. I'm assuming you are young and new to working.", "While I understand you\u2019re quitting, YTA to your coworkers. While you owe nothing to the managers I think you should apologize to them.\n\nETA: why did this make you cry??", "NTA. service staff are chronically under paid and under respected by everyone, society, employers, managers and customers . \n\nin this case you treated like crap for doing nothing wrong and decided to say \"fuck it this isnt worth the pittance i am paid\"   have a look at r/antiwork and you will see your far from alone. and far from being an AH", "INFO - what's the dresscode/ what were you supposed to be wearing?", "NTA\n\nToxic workplace is toxic.", "NTA\n\nRespond to only management and tell them you were treated unfairly and will contact HR. Still contact them, other people will have to work under this AH!", "Info: what was the manager trying to get you to change into? Do you have a regular uniform? Was your clothing in violation of the dress code?", "INFO why exactly were you asked to change", "NTA you owe your job nothing.", "NTA\n\nGood for you for not putting up with this. If the event was that important then his behavior should've reflected that. He's responsible for his actions resulting in your response. You responded to their treatment of you.", "NTA but I'm lost, why did you react so strongly and cry over pants? I need more info personally", "NTA", "Nta its a temp job for a teen. Its not even low stakes. Its no stakes.", "My top was the uniform shirt they gave me, unmodified and tucked in. It was my pants that where the issue. My coworkers dressed the exact same, with jeans shorts and leggings all black. \n\nThey didn\u2019t give me a specific reasons. They just told me to change, they even gave me money to buy new ones. But never told me outright the issue.\n\nMy pants are black dress pants by forever 21, high waisted reaching my ankles.", "No they\u2019re black dress pants from forever 21 not baggy or tight at all, straight cut high waisted and ankle touching. They allow leggings and shorts too btw", "No. She says other employees have done this too. Boss has a stick up his ass and terrorizes employees", "somone quitting is never the AH. they have been driven to it by bad management and its a total AH move to call them on it. \n\nits bullying end of story and from the OPS description of good staff just leaving its got a long history of it. probably caused by the same manager.", "I have genuinely no idea why i cried, I think apart of it was a build up of the managers comments over time.\n\nAnd thank you I fully accept being the asshole in this situation, I just wanted other\u2019s opinions, I really appreciate it.", "They never elaborated it", "> They just told me to change, they even gave me money to buy new ones.

If that person is going to be allowed to dictate HOW you dress but can't communicate how you SHOULD dress there's just nothing else to be done.\n\nAs a dude, if the bosses need me to look a certain way for the benefit of some client, i'll do whatever. But they have to tell me what's expected.", "This is just bizarre.  When he said go change your pants, what was the reason he gave you that you needed to change them?", "Okay but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that now all her coworkers have to pick up the slack for her leaving. Working at a restaurant is already hard and now they all have to make sacrifices for at least the next week, if the schedule is only made one week at a time. \n\nWhich is why I said she owes management nothing but should apologize to her coworkers.

The manager responsible for harassing you about your clothes then it's their responsibility for you quitting and their responsibility they are short staffed. If they weren't an asshole you'd be working, simple as that.\n\nAm I wrong in assuming this particular manager thinks that you as a woman should be wearing a dress or something and dress pants aren't what they deem appropriate?

A lot of restaurants the dress code is black dress pants and a white shirt for all staff, so it really shouldn\u2019t have been an issue, especially with other managers not having any problems.", "I've worked in food service and sugar, you aren't an asshole.
