The wedding planning has been a smooth process and we've had no issues until late last week. I invited a friend (N) from school, we've been friends for 12 years and have drifted apart due to life. She has always been quiet and not one to open up much, but Ive witnessed her unwavering support for the lgbtq+ community numerous times. N got into a relationship about 4 years ago and had a baby with the man (L) last year. I met L at her baby shower and he seemed decent until I noticed some things, such as complaining that his son will not be using a pink colored teething ring and that the gender neutral clothing looked too 'girly', and that he answered quite a few questions for N, stared her down and would white knuckle her knee every time she tried to give a different answer. I wholeheartedly believe she is being abused, because she is so quiet and doesnt stand up for herself.\n\nThe main issue is that my gay sister and a few of my gay/bisexual cousins and friends are in my wedding party, and L does not like that. They (mostly L) called me last week to let me know how disrespectful it was to god that Ive allowed \"the homos to infiltrate a sacred god ordained union\". I laughed and hung up. N called me some hours later when she was alone and apologized for L's behavior, but told me she cant do anything about that. I asked her if she truly felt the way about my wedding that L claimed she did, and she sat quiet for about a minute before she laughed a bit and let an I dont know slip out of her mouth. I let her know that because of recent events regarding the lgbtq community here in Colorado I will be protecting my family and friends by not taking any chances, and therefore she and L are uninvited from my wedding. If anyone is wondering how they found out about my family being lgbtq+, me and fiance started a large group chat of friends/family to get to know eachother, and a few relatives have shocked me by their vitriolic contempt for the lgbt community, so they have been uninvited as well for safety, and fiance agrees. \n\nA few mutual friends are calling me an asshole and unreasonable for what Ive done, because we've all seen N's support for the community firsthand, and we've all seen the manipulative behavior from L and know she is possibly being abused. Unfortunately I dont feel I can do anything further and Im going to do what I feel is right to protect my family.

How many gay and trans folks need to be hurt, how many bisexual people need to be invalidated, how many queer folk need to be mistreated medically, psychologically, religiously, socially, before people realize the world is STILL not safe for us? You are absolutely in the right by not taking any chances because the world is crazy right now, especially given the recent events in Colorado and the political climate division. I feel for your friend and Im sorry shes gotten herself onto this situation, but ultimately this is your wedding; do what you gotta do to protect your loved ones.", "**NTA**. \n\nYes obviously N is being bullied and controlled by L.  But inviting them to your wedding is not going to help anyone.", "NTA. N may have supported the community in the past, but she decided to marry a homophobe and not to challenge his views when he thought to tell you how to run your wedding. She may be controlled and abused by L, but your wedding is not the time to do something about that. You did right to not expose your family to a homophobe. If you want to help N, you can do so later.", "NTA Your friend may have had \"unwavering\" support for the lgbtq+ community in the past, but her support is clearly wavering now. It's your wedding and the last thing you need are people calling you up to harass you about it, or showing up at the wedding and harassing your guests. I wanted to mention (probably already occurred to you) but she may not have actually been alone on the phone, he may have been listening in or from the other room or something, so that's why she said \"I don't know.\" She may not have realized what she was getting into when she had a child with this person, but you have to protect yourself and your friends who've done nothing wrong.", "Absolutely NTA. Protect your family.", "NTA. Supporting L means helping get her out an abusive relationship, not causing harm to your friends and family by inviting her to your wedding.", "The issue is, N isn\u2019t going to leave L. As sad as it is that she deffo seems to be under his thumb, you\u2019re NTA for not wanting to un-invite a small portion of your family for 1 homophobic AH. \n\nI feel for N, I really do. But while she\u2019s got the rose coloured glasses on, you can\u2019t help someone who won\u2019t help them self. And she has a baby with him which is gonna make it more difficult. And I have a feeling if you tried to un-invite L and just invite N, there would be even more problems. It\u2019s your wedding at the end of the day. Of course you\u2019d choose family over this guy.", "NTA", "NTA. You get to invite the people you want to celebrate the beginning of you married life. Hate has no place at this celebration", "NTA. Safety comes first. You could keep low contact with N for support in case she ever decides to leave L but you can't do much more.", "NTA. You can't help people who can't help themselves. You extended the olive branch by asking how she truly felt, and she just laughed in your face.", "NTA, you could call her up acknowledging that she may be going through a hard time herself (assuming she's forced to say what she said), but you can't do anything about it and her husband is unwelcome to your wedding, period. And for safety reasons (that she should know about) her invitation is also revoked. She probably can't come alone anyways. \n\nThe other friends calling you AH are potential uninvitees as well", "Why are you still calling them a friend?", "NTA - You need to protect your family and this was necessary to do so. I would recommend reaching out to N privately though to let her know you will always be there for her.", "It\u2019s sad but there\u2019s nothing you can do about N. As cruel as it sounds it\u2019s literally impossible to help someone out of an abusive marriage unless they are actively seeking to leave it themselves. Not tiptoeing around it and showing her how ridiculous and vile her husband is acting is as close as you can get.\n\nNTA, though I feel for you since it\u2019s clear even in this post that you still have empathy and worry for your friend. You\u2019re making the right choice.", "NTA. Your friend is being manipulated and abused, and it\u2019s safe to say that if N were to be invited, bad things could and likely would happen because of L.

Absolutely but she better get used to it because it sounds like her SO is a jerk so they will get left out a lot.  Also, having people like that at your wedding isn\u2019t safe for your guests and will make you nervous the whole night worrying about something happening.  You don\u2019t need that and your guests don\u2019t need that.  Anyone that thinks you are TA for uninviting homophobic people needs to open their eyes and read the news.

I would be concerned for your friend too, but letting them come to the wedding is not going to improve her situation at all and puts everyone else there at risk of verbal (or worse) abuse.

I\u2019ve lost two long time friends because they have fallen down some of the batshit crazy stuff that\u2019s said about the LGBTQ+ community (one used to say she was non-binary but now believes the worst about trans people, the other identified as pansexual but is not dating an openly homophobic man) so I understand the pain and I understand how hard it is to watch people just\u2026change. But you\u2019re better off without those kind of people in your life and at your wedding.", "NTA you have to protect your family and guests.", "NTA.  She may be supportive alone, but she isn't going to come to the wedding alone.  \n\nI hope you and your friends are able to help her out of the situation when she's ready", "NTA. With the increasing rise in transphobia/homophobia and hate crimes targeted at the LGBTQ+, it's more than reasonable to uninvite intolerant people and make your queer family and friends feel safe and welcomed. It's very lovely that you're so considerate and respectful towards your queer family/friends.", "NTA you did good. Maybe after the wedding check in to see if she's ok?", "NTA.  Unwavering support which collapses as soon as the person faces any conflict or potential consequence for it isn't unwavering, it's just untested.\n\n(to be clear, having to break up with a homophobic asshole is a consequence which should be warmly embraced, especially when he's clearly going to make their kid's life a nightmare if he has the slightest suspicion they're not cis-het)", "I think YTA. You seen your friend being abused and didnt do anything about it and you saw her support the lgbt community, so you know she does. If he is manipulating her into being homophobic then youre TA again for not just inviting her and giving her a chance to explain herself without him breathing down her neck. \nAlso if L and your relatives didnt threaten your family and just dont agree with the gay lifestyle, they should be given some grace. Lots of peopl dont agree with being gay but they shouldnt be punished for it by not celebrating your love with you.", "I came to say this!!!!! NTA.

Odd.", "The people who \"don't agree with the gay lifestyle\" are part of why shit like the shootings happens. Just listen to what the recent shooter's dad had to say. They absolutely do not deserve to be \"given grace\" for their shitty, harmful, and genuinely dangerous beliefs, as coy and innocent as they may want to act about it. OP is NTA; people who perpetuate this way of thinking are.", "If OP only invites N and not L, then there is a chance that L won't let N go, or he'll tag along anyway and cause a scene.  OP can't help N if she won't accept it. Yes, Op should try to get her alone and ask some questions without his presence, but her wedding day is not the day to do that.\n\nNTA", "With the description OP has given us of him, you really think he\u2019s going to let N go to the wedding by herself? No, he won\u2019t. \n\nAnd OP can\u2019t help N if N doesn\u2019t want to be helped. It\u2019s sad, but it\u2019s what happens. \n\nAnd it\u2019s still OP\u2019s wedding at the end of the day. She can have who she wants there and she wants her family and not a homophobic AH who seems to think he\u2019s more important that someone like her own sister.", ">\u201dLots of peopl dont agree with being gay but they shouldnt be punished for it by not celebrating your love with you.\u201d\n\nI understand *you* have no standards for the company you keep, but clearly OP does."]}
