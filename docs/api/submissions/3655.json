The wedding planning has been a smooth process and we've had no issues until late last week. I invited a friend (N) from school, we've been friends for 12 years and have drifted apart due to life. She has always been quiet and not one to open up much, but Ive witnessed her unwavering support for the lgbtq+ community numerous times. N got into a relationship about 4 years ago and had a baby with the man (L) last year. I met L at her baby shower and he seemed decent until I noticed some things, such as complaining that his son will not be using a pink colored teething ring and that the gender neutral clothing looked too 'girly', and that he answered quite a few questions for N, stared her down and would white knuckle her knee every time she tried to give a different answer. I wholeheartedly believe she is being abused, because she is so quiet and doesnt stand up for herself.\n\nThe main issue is that my gay sister and a few of my gay/bisexual cousins and friends are in my wedding party, and L does not like that. They (mostly L) called me last week to let me know how disrespectful it was to god that Ive allowed \"the homos to infiltrate a sacred god ordained union\". I laughed and hung up. N called me some hours later when she was alone and apologized for L's behavior, but told me she cant do anything about that. I asked her if she truly felt the way about my wedding that L claimed she did, and she sat quiet for about a minute before she laughed a bit and let an I dont know slip out of her mouth. I let her know that because of recent events regarding the lgbtq community here in Colorado I will be protecting my family and friends by not taking any chances, and therefore she and L are uninvited from my wedding. If anyone is wondering how they found out about my family being lgbtq+, me and fiance started a large group chat of friends/family to get to know eachother, and a few relatives have shocked me by their vitriolic contempt for the lgbt community, so they have been uninvited as well for safety, and fiance agrees. \n\nA few mutual friends are calling me an asshole and unreasonable for what Ive done, because we've all seen N's support for the community firsthand, and we've all seen the manipulative behavior from L and know she is possibly being abused. Unfortunately I dont feel I can do anything further and Im going to do what I feel is right to protect my family.

Unwavering support which collapses as soon as the person faces any conflict or potential consequence for it isn't unwavering, it's just untested.\n\n(to be clear, having to break up with a homophobic asshole is a consequence which should be warmly embraced, especially when he's clearly going to make their kid's life a nightmare if he has the slightest suspicion they're not cis-het)", "I think YTA.

If he is manipulating her into being homophobic then youre TA again for not just inviting her and giving her a chance to explain herself without him breathing down her neck. \nAlso if L and your relatives didnt threaten your family and just dont agree with the gay lifestyle, they should be given some grace.

I spoke to N one-on-one and asked her if she truly shared L's views and she said 'I don't know'. You all know that N goes nowhere without L. As N is no longer strongly against being associated with homophobia I am choosing to protect my family from being exposed to homophobic rants. People are murdering LGBTQ people, I am not the AH for wanting my wedding to be a safe space for my family during such a dark time for gay rights. I hope the N we all remember who would never tolerate homophobia resurfaces one day. Do you honestly see that happening before my wedding date?

As a proud member of the lgbtq community I thank you for supporting your family. Protect them and when you get the chance. Kick that sorry sack of false Christian shit in the nuts. As a Christian (I know right two in one crazy) I find it horrible he claims god gives a dam. Quite frankly people are murdering and raping each other and destroying the planet. I don't think god gives a fuck who you have sex with. Or if you don't have sex. Not the point. I just don't believe god cares that much. If he is truly loves us all. He won't care who we love or who we are. So again thank you and kick L in the nuts.", "YTA. Said my opinion, if you downvote me that's your conscience not mine.", "This woman clearly sounds like she is in a Domestic Violence relationship, and leaving DV abusers is most often not easy at all - not the least due to the fact that often the abuse significantly escalated when the victim is leaving and the abuser fears that he is losing control; also btw the time when a majority of lethal incidences occur.\n\nOf course she should leave (safely), as soon as she can for many reasons; but quite frankly the guy being a homophobe probably *right now* is not exactly on the top of her immediate concerns (that might be more: \u201cI hope he does not hurt me or kill me today\u201d).", "And if anyone responds saying she's in an abusive relationship, point out it takes people in an abusive relationship 7 times to successfully leave. And they only leave when they want to. N doesn't want to leave yet and you don't know how long it's going to be until she does, or if she will ever want to leave.

YTA for not offering N the support she needs. You say you have been friends for 12 years but you cut her off from part of her support network, you may be all she has. Call her, get her help. Email her info on battered womens shelters if you think physical abuse. Offer her a place to go if she wants out.

The absolute best thing OP can do right now is leave the door open to her if or when she needs it, but not to put the people at the wedding in danger.\n\nA lot of people stay in abusive relationships because they feel isolated and trapped.\n\nDo what you need to do now to keep people safe, but also keep one foot in the door incase she also needs a safe place in the future.", "I think it's more likely L was listening to the conversation, probably standing right next to her or on the line in another room.\n\nEven then, OP's absolutely NTA."]}
