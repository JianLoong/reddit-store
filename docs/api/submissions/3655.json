The wedding planning has been a smooth process and we've had no issues until late last week. I invited a friend (N) from school, we've been friends for 12 years and have drifted apart due to life. She has always been quiet and not one to open up much, but Ive witnessed her unwavering support for the lgbtq+ community numerous times. N got into a relationship about 4 years ago and had a baby with the man (L) last year. I met L at her baby shower and he seemed decent until I noticed some things, such as complaining that his son will not be using a pink colored teething ring and that the gender neutral clothing looked too 'girly', and that he answered quite a few questions for N, stared her down and would white knuckle her knee every time she tried to give a different answer. I wholeheartedly believe she is being abused, because she is so quiet and doesnt stand up for herself.\n\nThe main issue is that my gay sister and a few of my gay/bisexual cousins and friends are in my wedding party, and L does not like that. They (mostly L) called me last week to let me know how disrespectful it was to god that Ive allowed \"the homos to infiltrate a sacred god ordained union\". I laughed and hung up. N called me some hours later when she was alone and apologized for L's behavior, but told me she cant do anything about that. I asked her if she truly felt the way about my wedding that L claimed she did, and she sat quiet for about a minute before she laughed a bit and let an I dont know slip out of her mouth. I let her know that because of recent events regarding the lgbtq community here in Colorado I will be protecting my family and friends by not taking any chances, and therefore she and L are uninvited from my wedding. If anyone is wondering how they found out about my family being lgbtq+, me and fiance started a large group chat of friends/family to get to know eachother, and a few relatives have shocked me by their vitriolic contempt for the lgbt community, so they have been uninvited as well for safety, and fiance agrees. \n\nA few mutual friends are calling me an asshole and unreasonable for what Ive done, because we've all seen N's support for the community firsthand, and we've all seen the manipulative behavior from L and know she is possibly being abused. Unfortunately I dont feel I can do anything further and Im going to do what I feel is right to protect my family.

This is one hell of a catch-22. Disinviting your friend runs the risk of further entrenching the isolation her potentially abusive husband may be trying to force on her.

There are no good choices here, only harm reduction choices.\n\nRealistically, weddings and similarly high stakes emotional events are not good places to do the work of trying to preserve a friendship being broken down by an abusive partner. No one is going to have the emotional bandwidth to handle a crisis or problem well and since it's high stakes that's likely to end in hurt feelings all around. This feels like a good time to reach out to your friend and kindly offer a method of regular communication at least somewhat protected from her husband's interference before letting her know that you cannot allow her husband to attend your wedding, and while you are not explicitly univiting her, she is welcome to say or do whatever she needs to in order to keep herself safe, and you will not hold those decisions against her. Tell her you love her and want only her happiness, and that you hope she stays in touch, and then make sure someone is on hand to turn him away if necessary.\n\nI'm really sorry this is happening.

It\u2019s terrible that the world has come to this, but it\u2019s completely reasonable for you to be afraid for your friends\u2019 safety in this situation.\n\nI would make it clear to her why you\u2019re doing this, and while you\u2019re at it let her know to contact you if she needs help getting out.", "This.  Help your friend get out of there if you can, but keep yourself and your loved ones safe. NTA", "Hopefully they can find someway to support N and talk with her about the abuse she is having done to her. Let her knowvwhat options she has if she needs to escape, who to call and where she can stay.", "How is it jot helping? Not having a person like L at the wedding is 100% the right thing. Also I guarantee that N will not be sloud to attend without L.", "I would add that you could tell her specifically what support you could offer if she ever felt the need to leave her husband. Could you give her a ride to a shelter, offer her a room in your house, or help her get a bus ticket to a relative? Knowing what her options would be if she needed to leave can be the thing that helps her get free ultimately. Ideally she would make a safety plan for what to do if her situation became untenable.", "There is zero point in helping anyone who doesn't want to be helped. Let her live as a happy homophobe housewife as long as that's what she wants to do. \n\nBeing unable to even denounce his homophobic comments in private means she wholly agrees with them. She has bought in. It is over and done. There is nothing and nobody to be helped.", "You may want to reread the comment you replied to, because you're actually on the same page.", "NTA, as a lesbian with family that tolerates gay people at best, I can\u2019t imagine how validating it is for your sister and other queer family members to know that you support them and the lgbtq+ community enough to uninvited someone you\u2019ve been friends with for 12 years. I know for a fact my family wouldn\u2019t uninvite someone from their wedding for being homophobic, even if they weren\u2019t close to them. you\u2019re doing the right thing, and I guarantee this means a lot to your family. imo, this is what being an ally looks like - making hard decisions that benefit and support the queer community even when they may cause controversy and contempt. \n\nI truly hope your friend can get out of this damaging relationship, but until she does it\u2019s simply not safe for your family to be around her or her partner.\n\nedit: typo", "NTA protect your family and friends.  No hateful bigots needed at your beautiful wedding!\n\nI also hope you can be there for N if and when she ever manages to get away from that abusive bigot.", "NTA - you're right in protecting your friends and family.", "NTA.  Aside from all the other comments about protecting your friends in this climate (which are completely valid), there's also the rock-hard axiom -- your wedding, your choice.", "Yes she is definitely being abused\n\nYes you should do everything you can to get her away from her abuser \n\nNo you don\u2019t need to invite her to your wedding to be able to do that", "NTA, I wouldn't let L near my family either. Homophobes need to stop using religion for being assholes. Love is love and they can stay at home.\n\nYes, N is being abused, but until she does something it won't change. She will never get help, just support, until she leaves.", "NTA. Always protect your family first. I would have done the same thing as you. There\u2019s no place for bigotry and hatred in polite society. However, if you can find a way to privately let your friend know that there are resources out there to help her out of an abusive relationship, I would do that as well. It sounds like she\u2019s being coached into saying what her partner wants to hear and I worry for her safety. But your instinct to protect your family is spot on, so don\u2019t budge on that front.", "Unless they are using the wedding to get her out of the situation like they\u2019re Oskar Schindler there is nothing wrong with disinviting her.\n\nYou probably should take some very serious steps to address your friends safety though.", "NTA, but your distant friend needs someone close to her to offer help. You don't want to look back and think \"I always thought he might hurt her\".", "She chose a life of homophobia and domestic abuse. I wouldn't invite her either.  NTA", "While you are NTA for deciding not to invite your friend, I think the title of this post is rather misleading. the title paints N as being newly homophobic, but you admit it sounds more like she\u2019s possibly being abused and suppressed by her husband. You might want to edit that if you can, because it comes across a bit that you\u2019re judging her to be homophobic for not standing up to her husband, even though you suspect she\u2019s being abused.   \n\n\nagain, NTA for keeping her out of the wedding to keep the peace, but see if you can reach  out to her separate from the wedding to see if she\u2019s alright.", "NTA.  People change.  She may have been supportive before, but clearly that has changed for her.  She called to say sorry, but when you asked if she felt that way she said \"I dont know\". That means she feels the same as him and is apologizing to make you feel better, not because she is sorry.", "NTA\n\nDate stupid men, win stupid prizes.\n\nSome women are very malleable when they are in relationships. She\u2019s made her choices and has to live with the consequence. Maybe it\u2019ll be a wake-up call.", "SO NTA. Anyone who says you're an asshole for refusing to tolerate Homophobia, is telling you how they really feel about queer people too. You are a QUEEN and you are awesome.", "NTA", "NTA. But the way she responded on the phone\u2026I wonder if he monitors her calls / messages. Her reaction was not normal. This woman is clearly terrified.", "NTA.\n\nHonestly, straight women like her should stay away from us. She's being passive with him, maybe because she being abused, maybe because she's just that much in love. Who cares though, because letting someone like her near lgbtq+ people and/or spaces, means she brings her own personal monster. I respect you for putting her in her place with it, and it actually makes me feel better seeing more examples of a straight people who truly get it too. Esp after the latest incident.\n\nCongrats on your wedding, I hope you have a lovely day.", "NTA", "N may have done a \"lot\" in the past for the community, but she's absolutely showing that her support is conditional when it comes to her own personal comfort. And, guess what, that's absolutely not good enough, especially right now, to guarantee the well-being and safety of anyone LGBT at the wedding. If she's being abused, the safest course of action would not be centered around inviting N to the wedding and/or keeping her involved with the event, but for OP to say that she would support N if and when she needs help leaving.", "All of this, but id also extend an olive branch to the friend to let her know op will help her if she needs to leave, that is textbook signs of abuse and the fact that he's so blatant about it in front of people means it is escalating", "Yes, N is showing signs she's coping with the abuse by identifying with her perpetrator. Tragic, but not OP's responsibility.", "Well said!", "This doesn't seem like rose colored glasses, N seems to be genuinely afraid of standing up for herself.\n\nThe wedding is not the day to do it, I understand that, but OP may need to perform a legitimate rescue of N before things start to get physical. There isn't going to be that magical day where she wakes up and the truth hits her and she leaves on her own. Women in her position are in very real danger and need help getting to safety.", "N probably is genuinely scared of him. But OP can\u2019t save her unless she wants to be saved and that\u2019s the sad reality of it. If she tries to make N leave now, it\u2019s highly likely that N will end up going back to him anyway. \n\n\u2018Oh it\u2019s not that bad\u2019 \u2018he didn\u2019t mean to hurt me, he said he\u2019s sorry\u2019 \u2018he only said it because of xyz\u2019. Those are the glasses. You can see the red flags but with rose coloured glasses on, they just look like flags. OP could tell N until she\u2019s blue in the face about all the bad things about L, but it doesn\u2019t mean N is going to listen. \n\nPeople who have been in abusive relationships for a while end up going back to their abuser several times because it\u2019s the devil they know. Sometimes they don\u2019t get out until it gets really bad, sometimes they don\u2019t get out before it\u2019s too late. N has to want to leave, but I think it\u2019ll be hard for her now, especially with their baby. I think if OP wants to be a good friend, she\u2019ll always offer to be there for support and be ready to jump in and help when the day finally comes that N wants to leave. OP won\u2019t be able to rescue her before that day. \n\nI\u2019ve been in N\u2019s situation. Twice. And it got worse and worse and worse and I didn\u2019t leave no matter what. My second ex even threatened to stab me in the stomach with a knife while our son was laying in his Moses basket across the room. And I still didn\u2019t leave him then. Because he had such a hold on me. He came back every time with apologies and flowers and loads of gifts and would get on his knees and beg for forgiveness, and I took him back every time because he made me believe that I was a horrible human being and that he was the only person who would ever want to be with me and I believed him. With everything he did to me, it took him kicking the crap out of me whilst holding our son for me to leave. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever been the situation, and I pray that you never have been, but it\u2019s different for everyone and it\u2019s easier to make comments looking in on the situation. I can make judgements about N and L\u2019s relationship based off of what OP wrote, but I\u2019ll never know their situation for sure.", "NTA and thank you.", "Definitely NTA. Your friend doesn\u2019t sound homophobic, I agree her us and us and she\u2019s being abused. But it dies t sound like you\u2019ll be able to invite her without him, and he is clearly not a safe person. I would encourage you and/or one of your other mutual friends to offer your support to her privately if you can, but I would absolutely not have that man in your life or at your wedding.", "op=NTA\n\nI'm sorry for your Friend N and if you can let her know you will try to maintain a friendship if she needs it, that you cannot allow your family (and other friends) be abused and possibly endangered by L.\n\nUnfortunately, she is making a choice by being with L and that means she loses out on some of the privileges of friendship because of his behavior.", "Even if she is being abused, it won\u2019t help her to go to the wedding, she\u2019ll just be tormented by his actions alienating her from her friends even more. NTA but see if she\u2019s willing to take any help", "NTA\n\nYou are protecting your friends and family. And you can still support N by giving her numbers that will help her or setting up a help word she can use if she needs to leave ASAP, but you aren't responsible for her if she doesn't take anything", "NTA", "NTA\n\nYes your friend is in an abusive relationship. However you do not need to invite the abusive and hateful commentary into your wedding. He\u2019s already shown that he will not respect you, your wedding, or your guests so he has no reason to be at your wedding. Your wedding is also not the place to start a fight for her independence.", "NTA. Have lots to say but will just get me more riled up. NTA", "So, I currently live in a women's DV shelter. I am familiar with these kinds of situations, as I hear and see them everyday. Obviously I'm there myself after fleeing an abusive partner.\n\nI have sympathy, but the truth is, I *don't* understand these situations. It hurts my brain and my heart to listen to some of the things the other women say about going back to their old lives when they literally survived attempted murder.\n\nSeveral people, including my Stepmum, have made comments about me going back to my ex. I shut that shit down so fast. It makes me angry that anyone would think I could put myself through that again. Getting back in my own place and living my old life again is all I can think about.\n\nHe threw me down the stairs after forcing me to live in garbage for months. He drank everyday and smoked weed like it was going to made illegal again. He constantly talked about what I needed to be doing for him, even though I gave up most of my possessions to move across the effing country to be with him.\n\nI loved him so much and I will always treasure the good years we had, but I am not going to burn myself to the ground to baby his emotionally broken psyche."]}
