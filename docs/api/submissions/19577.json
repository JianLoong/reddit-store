No warning he decided to do it that night.\n\nAnd now, suddenly, there is what feels like a literal stranger crawling into my bed.

I could understand a slight annoyance at not being told, but to blow it up into talking about her \u201crights\u201d and your \u201clack of communication\u201d is throwing around some heavy stuff that just isn\u2019t needed for shaving a beard. \n\nSide note; if you thought that you telling her was going to result in an argument between you two, that honestly points to a larger issue. Has she shown controlling behavior before where you thought it would be a similar argument?

If it's a dealbreaker or seriously hurts the relationship, the other person should be about to say \"no, this isn't what I signed up for\".  \n\n\nAnd the person who wants to make the change then has a choice of whether or not it's worth the relationship to continue.", "Yeah I don't think you did anything wrong.

Here's the thing:  I've been married a long time.  If I came downstairs tomorrow with a clean shave or a different hairstyle, I think my wife would be upset and weirded out.  And she's wonderful.  Not controlling at all.  For reference, I've been to 3 nights bachelor parties in Vegas and she was totally cool.  It's not a controlling thing.\n\nBut also, when I stop and think about it, if she came home with a different hair color or cut her hair short and never mentioned she was thinking about doing it, I think I'd be upset too.

And if she is threatened by OP's ability to do what he wants over a largely inconsequential and innocuous detail such as physical appearance, that is a BIG red flag. That's not \"different\". That is straight up controlling.\n\nEdit: Saw later on that OP's partner apologized and was just jarred and admitted she was wrong. However, I maintain that comparing a 4 month relationship to a years-long relationship with regards to expectations is vastly different. It *may* be reasonable to expect to give a polite heads-up in a marriage. Some spouses will care, some will not when a partner changes their looks completely. However, is *not* reasonable to be expected to have to give that heads-up this early into a relationship. Nice, yes. But absolutely not required.

Meanwhile you\u2019re telling someone who says they have a partner and is also saying they are on the spectrum and struggles knowing how to read things to ditch that person for being controlling.  Even though they\u2019ve been there for four months, knowing he\u2019s on the spectrum, and has chosen to stay in the relationship.\n\nWithout way more context and information, how can anyone really know?", ">Without way more context and information, how can anyone really know?\n\nBecause I'm comfortable in saying someone who had been dating someone for 4 months and trying to control how they handle their personal style & hygiene is a major red flag?\n\nThat's quite literally every single post on AITA, and if that's the case, why do you participate at all?", "Never said to leave the girl. However what I pointed out was that the *expectation* was still wrong this early in a relationship. Hell, even OP's partner admitted it was wrong to expect that of him. \n\nYour opinion was neither here nor there because you were comparing apples to oranges and you were excusing the inappropriate expectation. Expectations in a healthy 4 month relationship (married or not) are not the same as a years-long marriage. Period. \n\nAnd now you're excusing your own poor opinion based on the justification of \"how can anyone really know?\" and on arguments that \"there are some people who get married far quicker\"? Jeez. Once again, your opinion is neither here nor there. The epitome of ignorance and unhelpful.\n\nEdit: Would like to add that, in all fairness, the girl apologizing downgrades red flag to pink flag. Still something to be wary of. Could still turn into something ugly and controlling later on. Harder to tell this early. But it is nice that she could admit fault and apologized."]}
