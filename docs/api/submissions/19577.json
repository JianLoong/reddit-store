I\u2019m just explaining why it can be so jarring. A haircut isn\u2019t quite the same as changing the way your face looks. \n\nI was just trying to share a different perspective and say that while permission isn\u2019t required at all, giving a heads up could be a nice thing to do.", "Sounds like you guys just need to sit down and have a conversation. No accusations or anything, just \"I feel...\" type statements. If you don't understand why she reacted a certain way, ask. If you're uncomfortable with some kind of conditions she wants to put on your relationship, say so. Discuss expectations on any sort of change going forward and decide if that is something both of you can live with or not. It needs to go both ways and it's not really fair for her to hold you to something that she isn't okay doing for you as well, such as a change in personal aesthetic."]}
