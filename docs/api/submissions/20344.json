I am currently still recovering from my planned c-section and it is taking a lot longer than I had hoped.  I am not on bedrest, but pretty darn close.  Unless it's to go to the bathroom or changing or feeding my baby, I'm pretty much always sitting or laying down.  I don't like it, but it's what my body needs to heal right now.  Both my husband and I are still on maternity/paternity leave.\n\nObviously, that means that pretty much every other aspect of our lives falls on my husband right now.  He' been doing a great job of taking care of the older kids and making sure everything in our lives is running as smoothly as it can given our circumstances.  He's also great about taking care of the baby and giving me breaks as much as he can.  But I can tell it's starting to wear on him mentally and physically.  Neither of us is sleeping well and I swear he looks like he's lost more weight than I have since the baby came.  \n\nDue to me being pretty much immobile, I can't really go out of the house to do anything without assistance.  So I wasn't able to plan anything really fun for Father's Day.  I did help the older kids make him cards and ordered him some nice steaks to cook though.  I felt bad because for Mother's Day he bought me a 6-hour pregnancy spa treatment and took the older kids out of the house all day so I could have peace.   \n\nBut on the morning of Father's Day, I was feeling worse than usual as I had to strain myself the day before to pick up something off the floor and I aggravated my incision.  So, I was laid up all day.  Again, this meant my husband had to do literally everything that day.  By the time he got the older kids to bed, I could tell he was irritated and upset.  I told him to try and relax for a bit, but then the baby started fussing and he jumped up off the couch, grabbed a pillow, and screamed into it.  \n\nI tried to calm him down, but he just kept freaking out about how he's at his wits end and he needs a break and that I couldn't even find a way to give him a single hour of quiet on Father's Day.  I started crying and he just looked at me and walked away to take care of the baby without saying anything.  \n\nAfter he took care of the baby he came back to me and apologized, but he said he needs a break and he's going to talk to family about taking the older kids for a week or so and that he's just disappointed that his Father's Day was spent running around doing everything for everyone else.  He didn't even get to cook his steaks, he ate cold pizza for dinner.   \n\nI asked him what I was supposed to do because it's not like I can move or leave the house and he said I could have looked into a sitter for the kids or made them sit with me and watch a movie for an hour so he could have just a sliver of time for himself.  He said he feels like his needs are at the bottom of the list and he just wanted to feel like he matters for one day.

It\u2019s much easier to have a regular one.\nIf you can\u2019t afford a real sitter there are tons of teens looking for \u201c mom helper\u201d positions- they can play with kids, do dishwasher and some other help.\nYou guys can\u2019t handle 3 kids like that, it will not end well", "YTA:  Unless you left it out, you didn't even console your husband. He broke down in front of you after weeks maybe months of doing a lot on his own.

There wasn't a restaurant to doordash or deliver or something like that?  My dad likes to grill out on Fathers Day....but he has exactly himself to look after - not three very small children.\n\nAnd I Guess - if you could email/call to order steaks...why didn't you email or call parents or other family or friends to possibly babysit?  It sounds like some kind of family may be close - if it's an option for him to call family to take the older kids.  I get that he can call...but its fathers day.  \n\nAnd it honestly doesn't sound like you were very sympathetic to him.  You know its wearing on him mentally and physically.  To the point of noticeable weight loss.  And it was just \"calm down what I am I supposed to do?\"  \n\nI don't think he's the asshole - I don't see anything he did that would make him one.  He didn't yell at you or act aggressive toward you.  He didn't take it out on the children.  I waiver between YTA and NAH, depending on why you could order steaks in advance, but not even try to find some assistance (either family or a friend).", "YTA\n\nYou are a recovering mother which everyone should understand but I\u2019ve spent 30 seconds reading this and already thought \u201cwhy didn\u2019t she coordinate with a friend or family member etc to take the kids for a portion of the day\u201d. That takes bare minimum effort and shows how you care for your man on his day during this period where he\u2019s been getting the job done.

Enlisted family. You could have had SOMEONE take the kids for at least six hours. \n\nYou could see he was getting stressed, and was doing mentally & physically unwell. I understand where you're coming from. But phone calls will add no burden to you, and this would have meant a lot to him. \n\nYou need to be more aware of what you can do from where you're at to help out. Maybe enlisting a family member, or a babysitter once a week- just so your husband has some downtime. \n\n3 Kids all under the age of 5 is a lot, and you recognized that he is not doing well. DO what YOU CAN about it. \n\nIts awesome that you're communicating, keep at it.", "YTA. The time you took to write this should give you an indicator how you had the tools you needed at your fingertips to coordinate something for your hubby. Even a small amount would've done well for him; instead your response was \"what am I supposed to do.\"", "Somewhere between N A H and YTA. You\u2019re both in the thick of it right now. But he\u2019s not wrong that you could have figured out a way to make sure he got a break. You can call and text potential babysitters from bed. And like he said, you could have had the kids with you for an hour so he could relax.\n\nI\u2019m not saying you\u2019re a monster for not making it happen, but you should make it up to him. He\u2019s clearly on the verge of a complete nervous breakdown and badly needs a break.", "YTA. His suggestion are really valid. Even in your condition, you could hire a babysitter. He is crying for help and you recognize that this is affecting him a lot, so do something about it.", "My heart broke for your husband reading this, OP. You only cried for yourself. \n\nYTA", "YTA.\n\nYou did nothing for him on father's day. Absolutely nothing. You couldn't even make sure he had time to cook and eat the meal you tried to get for him.

You can pick up a phone.", "Omg as an OB nurse the only things we tell you not to do for 6 weeks is not picking anything up that\u2019s heavier than baby, no sex, or do chores that require abdominal work (no mopping, vacuuming).

How come u couldn\u2019t ask a friend/family for help? U couldn\u2019t organize some type of SOMETHING so your hubby can get a breather to pull his head above the water? \n\nYou acknowledge that he\u2019s struggling and your thought was \u201cwell, I can\u2019t do anything but since he\u2019s already doing it all, he might as well make himself some steaks while watching the kids\u201d? \n\nSure he could have asked for help himself but damn, you couldn\u2019t even toss a \u201chey mom/dad/friend, hubby has been doing so much these days, do u think u could watch the kids for a couple of hours so hubby can do xyz?\u201d On FATHERS DAY? yikes. \n\nAlso he vents to you that he\u2019s feelin let down and the first thing u do is cry abt it and ask \u201cwhat was I supposed to do\u201d?

My doctor reaaaally stressed that I had to get up and move even if I was sore. She said it would suck really bad at first but if I didn\u2019t do it I would feel awful and things would tighten up at the incision in a really negative way. \n\nI was nearly back to normal now. Sometimes I lift things too heavy they cause some pain and I get lightening nerve pain along the incision that is extremely brief. \n\nIf you couldn\u2019t find it in yourself to get off the damn couch the you could have at least arranged something for your kids or even had a conversation with your husband about what he would like. You SEE he is struggling and are choosing to refuse him some respite", "YTA\n\n> took the older kids out of the house all day so I could have peace. \n\nEven if you were in recovery yourself, why couldn't you enlist someone else to take the burden of the kids off him that day?

Hindsight, right? Maybe do a do over soon e.g. 4th of July weekend, maybe? Get him so help so he can enjoy the holiday!", "Did you have complications with your c-section. I know everyone\u2019s experience is different. I had a c-section as a single mom. After two weeks I was on my own. If you are still unable to do more than just the bare minimum by now you should call your doctor. Something may not be right.", "YTA. I definitely don\u2019t think you should be having to physically strain yourself while recovering from a surgery and a pregnancy but there were plenty of things you could\u2019ve done to try and relieve your husband of having to do literally everything. Why didn\u2019t you call a family member or a friend to see if they could take the kids for a day? Why didn\u2019t you try and hire a nanny or a babysitter to help with the kids and around the house? That is what you should have at least tried to do and that is what you should do in the future as well. Your husband has admitted to you that he is extremely burnt out and it is clear that he is at or almost at his breaking point with having to do everything himself. Since you can\u2019t help him at the moment you need to look into hiring someone to relieve some of the pressure from your husband before he snaps completely.", "YTA Look, I understand that you are recovering but you don't need to say \"calm down\" to a stressed AND tired person.  You should listen to him because he needs emotional suport.\n\nAlso, you could have ordered food from his favorite restaurant, not steaks that he had to prepare.", "I get that you\u2019re not we\u2019ll but you could\u2019ve put at least a little effort in doing something for him. Ordering him steaks for him to cook isn\u2019t a present. YTA here. You can do something for him from online or something.", "YTA.  Everyone else has covered what you should have done for him on Father\u2019s Day at least, but I have to ask\u2026 what is going on that one month past a c-section you are still unable to do *anything*?  Are your stitches infected? Do you have a comorbidity?  Everyone heals differently but a month is a long time to be incapable of anything.  \n\n(I had three kids, all via c, same age spread as yours, and I was even the same ages as you when I had each of my three.  I know everyone is different but this is wildly different.  Is it possible that you could be doing more? At four weeks, your incision isn\u2019t still open.)", "YTA. You could have reached out to family for help. Your fingers still work, you could have picked up the phone and made some calls. Your solution was to do as little as possible for this man who is almost single handedly caring for your family by buying him food that *he* needed to cook for himself.", "YTA Yes, you deserve to recover comfortably but why couldn\u2019t you get a babysitter or watch a movie with the kids? Why couldn\u2019t you use the internet (that you clearly have access to for this post) to book HIM a spa day? He\u2019s your partner , he\u2019s shouldering most of the duties - he deserved the day and deserves a partner who acts like a partner", "YTA. I\u2019ve had two c-sections so I\u2019m focusing on my experience as the caretaker\u2026\n\nMy husband had a summer when he was hospitalized off and on. I was the sole caregiver 24/7 and it wore me down. Even then, when he could see it was wearing on me, he coordinated with his mom to come give me a break. That\u2019s all he wanted. He\u2019s right, you could have snuggled up with all kids to watch a movie but\u2026 you didn\u2019t. You didn\u2019t think of his needs.", "YTA. \nYou said you felt bad because your husband got a babysitter and planned a spa day for yourself on Mothers Day. Lovely that you got the kids to make cards but you literally bought him raw steaks that he had to cook for himself, so again doing extra work on top of the childcare. \nYou say you\u2019ve noticed how much this past month has taken a toll on your husbands physical and mental health. Why couldn\u2019t you have asked for a babysitter for your kids or get someone to come round and help you while husband took some time for himself? \n\nIf this was the other way round, everyone would be attacking the husband for not doing anything for the wife for Mother\u2019s Day but because it\u2019s about the dad everyone\u2019s opinion is that he should have communicated and he was wrong to get frustrated? \nHe did the right thing in this situation, he screamed into a pillow before going to deal with his child and then came back in apologised for it and then communicated that he was upset about not having a break? \nSo rather writing this post, why not just sort out a day where he can have a few hours to himself? \nDads need a break too.", "YTA, you couldn\u2019t even be bothered to maybe order food for him, you got him steaks to cook himself.

I can't understand why op didn't call a friend or family member to help out for even an hour. I bet hubby can't wait to get back to work.", "Soft YTA. I know you\u2019re recovering but you say yourself you knew it was taking it\u2019s toll and you could\u2019ve done something for him. Order take out. Get a local baby sitter for an hour. Something.", "YTA girl it is not all about you. I have had three c sections and I made sure my husband had time without kids or responsibilities all the time. Like why not order him food \ud83c\udf71 and have it delivered and go in the other room so he can be alone and have the kids watched by someone else. Or seen if someone else could come over like a friend or babysitter and have them watch the kids and send him out with friends to do dinner and drinks.", "YTA - I can\u2019t believe you! If he is doing everything and you can\u2019t then get on the phone get a babysitter and a parting house keeping. You expect him to do it all and take care of the kids. You could do things that make his life easier even without getting out of bed. Could have had the family get involved too. Major major YTA", "Is Father's Day (or really any holiday) just an arbitrary date on the calendar and can we celebrate anything we want when we want?  Sure thing.  And does that mean that sometimes life interferes with making the arbitrary holiday calendar date a shitshow and we have to accept that and maybe float it to another day?  Sure thing.  Kids get sick, birthdays fall on weekdays or other occasions, etc.  So maybe his expectations for this day were a bit lofty considering the circumstances.\n\nBut this is clearly bigger than just Father's Day.  He's burned out.  I get that you aren't in a great place either recovering, but you failed to notice or take any initiative.\n\nThe part where YTA though is once he broke down and flat out told you...YOU MADE IT ABOUT YOURSELF!\n\nSo yeah, YTA.  Apologize.  Sit down and make a gameplan so both of you avoid burnout and figure out ways you can help within your limitations (i.e. pick up phone and make arrangements for meals or babysitting or playdates or delivery services or whatever it takes).\n\nETA:  And you're definitely TA for the one thing you did do...which was get him steaks he had to cook himself while watching three kids.  JFC, why didn't you just get him a puppy so he has one more thing to chase after?  At the very least DoorDash a cooked meal from a restaurant.", "YTA kind of, not terribly because you did not do this out of malice, but you really should've planned something for a sitter or maybe someone in the family to take the kids. Or at the very least should have ordered some type of nice thing to do at the house, like a nice meal he wouldn't have to make himself. I think you're both struggling though and I hope you guys get through this together", "YTA, while you can\u2019t do much you absolutely need to notice the stress in your husband. You should have got a sitter and planned an outing or something for him to do on his own. This is not an equal partnership", "YTA\n\nYour husband sounds like a single parent with all the burdens none of the benefits.", "YTA. But maybe N A H. Your husband is crying for help. He\u2019s pulling way more than his weight. He needs a break. You might not be able to  physically give it to him but why can\u2019t you help him get it? Call a sitter and then call his friends. Get him out of the house and having some adult time for awhile.", "Slight YTA but you can fix it with a do-over.", "A soft YTA.   Having had two C-sections, I get it.  But...4 weeks in and you're still laid up like that?  What does your doctor say?  You shouldn't be totally healed by 4 weeks but you shouldn't still be incapacitated either, that's not normal.   I'd call your doctor and ask to be seen.    No one should still be basically bedridden at that point.  Do you think that *maybe* you might be milking it a little?  It's hard to heal if you don't move.  I remember them telling me in the hospital that the best thing I could do to help heal is move as much as I could throughout the day.\n\nAlso, do you have any friends or family that could help out a little?  It IS kind of crappy that he was waiting on everyone hand and foot on fathers day (and the gift was you getting him food for HIM to cook?  Seriously?  Couldn't door dash a nice meal?) I suggest planning a substitute fathers day to make it up to him.  There has to be SOMEONE you can call to watch the older kids for a couple of hours.", "YTA.

You folks just need to figure out how to get a healthy balance.", "YTA but mainly because the first thing that came to my mind (and I scrolled back to check kids ages) is that you could have made it a \u201cmovie with mom\u201d day. Picked up some \u201cpicnic in bed\u201d foods and locked you and the older kids in the room for the day. You can not move but a 3&5 year old can chill in the room with you. \nOr even have bought some new toy to do on the bed that would keep their interest. \n\nYou could actually make this a daily thing with \u201cpicnic with mom\u201d or \u201cmovie night\u201d", "YTA - Jesus Christ this is one of the worst ones I\u2019ve read..", "YTA. He deserves a little bit of a break. Did you do ANYTHING for him? A gift? Order takeout? Like literally anything for Father\u2019s Day? Not to compare but my cousin had a c section with twins and after a month she was able to get up and move around. 4 weeks is a good amount of time for healing, it kind of sounds like you\u2019re milking it a bit", "YTA\n\nGet a sitter or send them to a movie.

The dude is burnt out AF and you couldn't be assed to even order in his favorite food for him but apparently you're healthy enough to type this all out? \n\nFYI My SIL had a c section literally last month and she was walking before they got home from the hospital. Whenever we'd come over and visit she'd be walking up and down the stairs and last time we came over she even stepped out herself to buy a cake for Father's Day. Ok fine let's say every case is different and recovering from a C section is tough. But if it's taking that long OP that you are still hurting at a time when many others like you start to recover... I am sorry but you should be having that shit checked by a doctor not continuing to make excuses for it.", "YTA. He needs help, and you may not have seen it before now, but now you know you need to do something.

I know your in recovery but as horrible as this might sound but sounds like your getting used to him doing everything.  I could be wrong and apologies if I am.  \nThis might also sound really horrible but part of recovery is trying to help yourself wherever possible - Even if its just thinking of how to help, discussing and ultimately picking up the phone to arrange help.  If you can\u2019t think of him, even on a day thats meant for him then you really need to think of your situation with him.", "YTA girliepop. You got him steaks that he himself had to cook?

Ugh", "YTA - a massive, giant AH.  You buying him steaks to cook on Father's Day is the equivalent of him buying you a vacuum on Mother's Day. He got you a spa day, and you gave him a grill order. Seriously, WTF.", "YTA You might be laid up but 30 days after a C-section you should be able to do light things . The longer you don't get up the harder it's going to be.  It sounds like he needs a break. He isn't asking for a week or even a week end. You should be able to have a friend or family member to come and sit for the day to help with the kids. You are just not putting any effort into taking any wt off him. Yes you had major surgery but if you still can't be out of bed you need to go back to your Dr because something isn't right or you are enjoying him doing everything.  I know people heal at different rates but you should be able to sit up and walk around the house. Cooking should be alright if you fix quick meals. Putting clothes in the laundry should be ok. You could get one of your children to hand you the clothes out of a basket so you don't have to bend too much. There are some small things you can do to help. It would make a big differences.", "YTA\n\nYou could have easily coordinated with family, friends, or a paid sitter to give him a break and you just didn\u2019t bother. Dudes carrying the burden of the entire household right now ffs", "YTA.\n\nYour husband is at his wits end and your response is to cry because it makes YOU feel bad", "Soft YTA, he sounds like an amazing dad, and he's doing so much to help. All he wanted was a little appreciation and a day for him. He's understandably upset. I'm right there with you.  I have an infant via cesarean, and I even had to do an extra surgery less than a month ago, but I made sure that man had his day. He held the baby and managed our toddler while I made him his father's day dinner, but we made it work because i love and appreciate everything he does for us. I feel like you owe him one.", "YTA.  Father's day isn't a surprise and you could have planned at least something for him, even before the new baby arrived.  He's at his wits end, you've been a spectator to that for a solid month if not more.  I know that I would feel like shit if someone got me raw steaks to cook on the day I was already busting my ass to do everything around the house.  It's just one more thing piled on during the day to do, even if he loves cooking.

Get over yourself and get off the couch.", "I'm a husband.\n\nNo one is the AH\nYou are both exhausted.\n\nThe only thing worse than not having a day off is thinking you will, and not having it.

I call bullshit on that.\n\nYour husband has spent the last month (at least; I bet you were also the \"I'm heavily pregnant and can't cook/clean/work/do childcare\" type) doing 99% of the parenting and household chores, but you couldn't manage to do anything for Father's Day but order some steaks for *him* to cook (and since you said \"steaks\" plural, I'm presuming you meant for him to make one for you, too)?!  You couldn't order him a gift?  Ask a friend or family member to help with the kids?  Order a fully-cooked meal?

Wtf?), bought some really nice presents. Instead you did nothing for a man who has, by your own admission, been working himself to the point of complete physical exhaustion. \n\nThen when he finally breaks (not snaps) you try to make it about yourself.

I am currently still recovering from my planned c-section and it is taking a lot longer than I had hoped.  I am not on bedrest, but pretty darn close.  Unless it's to go to the bathroom or changing or feeding my baby, I'm pretty much always sitting or laying down.  I don't like it, but it's what my body needs to heal right now.  Both my husband and I are still on maternity/paternity leave.\n\nObviously, that means that pretty much every other aspect of our lives falls on my husband right now.  He' been doing a great job of taking care of the older kids and making sure everything in our lives is running as smoothly as it can given our circumstances.  He's also great about taking care of the baby and giving me breaks as much as he can.  But I can tell it's starting to wear on him mentally and physically.  Neither of us is sleeping well and I swear he looks like he's lost more weight than I have since the baby came.  \n\nDue to me being pretty much immobile, I can't really go out of the house to do anything without assistance.  So I wasn't able to plan anything really fun for Father's Day.  I did help the older kids make him cards and ordered him some nice steaks to cook though.  I felt bad because for Mother's Day he bought me a 6-hour pregnancy spa treatment and took the older kids out of the house all day so I could have peace.   \n\nBut on the morning of Father's Day, I was feeling worse than usual as I had to strain myself the day before to pick up something off the floor and I aggravated my incision.  So, I was laid up all day.  Again, this meant my husband had to do literally everything that day.  By the time he got the older kids to bed, I could tell he was irritated and upset.

Try to reschedule Father's Day so he can get the break he deserves.", "NAH. And let me explain why (since you probably won't see my other comments in amongst the comment threads).\n\nPost-partum is hard. The fourth trimester, is *hard*.\n\nYou're only a month postpartum OP. Unless your child is a unicorn, I'm guessing you haven't slept more than 2-3hrs in a row for the last month? Probably had your sleep affected already before that during pregnancy? Breastfeeding (including cluster feeding) every few hours?\n\nYou'll be mentally and physically exhausted on so many levels. Sounds like you both are (shoutout to your husband for doing such an amazing job stepping up). Unless a person has actually been in your shoes, they'll have no idea of the toll it takes on mental processing etc to not be getting enough sleep for an extended period, and for your body to be giving everything it has to be producing milk *literally* 24/7 before your supply settles. At 1 month postpartum I was an utter zombie, and that was with my firstborn (i.e. no other kids to juggle). Father's Day for us hit 1 week postpartum, so I think the most I managed was a card. Different situation since we hadn't yet been sleep deprived for a month, so my partner's needs weren't at the level of your husband's yet.\n\nOverall though it sounds like he *really* needs a break right now. Dads can get postpartum depression too, which is the first thing that came to mind when you mentioned him screaming into the pillow. You need to look after each other, but you also need to seek support from outside your immediate family. Assuming you have good relationships with your parents and/or in-laws, it's ok to admit you're both struggling and ask them for help. Parenting is a tough gig, we can't get through it alone (and it's too much pressure on a relationship to expect that). \n\nSo, NAH, but *please* listen to your husband's needs when he's communicating that he's struggling, and work on a plan together to work through it. Sounds like getting the grandparents more involved with the older kids for a short period would be a great solution.\n\nMental health matters, for both of you as individuals, as parents, and as a couple. All the best.", "NTA. It\u2019s amazing you don\u2019t have postpartum depression while taking care of 4 kids. Yeah. Four. What grown man screams into a pillow\u2026 in front of his wife and kids?

AND THEN I ASKED MY HUSBAND\u2026 you guys are going through a very stressful time right. Your husband has a lot on his plate and is doing it all by himself. We had family on both sides taking turns helping with our babies, bringing casseroles every day, doing laundry, etc. Yes, you hurt a lot. As I said it\u2019s going to be a while before you don\u2019t. But I was told to walk at least 5 minutes every day because the more you sit the tighter your muscles get.

Absolutely. But there are NAH. The fourth trimester is *haaard*, even with an \"easy\" baby.

After my c-section, I wasn\u2019t even allowed to bend over to pick things up for a very long time, drive a car, and I couldn\u2019t pick up my toddler daughter because I could rip my stiches until after at least 6 weeks. \n\nSo yes, you could have ordered him a meal, yes you could have asked family members to take the older kids, but it can be hard to think like that when you\u2019re running off of zero sleep, in pain, and have two other kids.

We both got a couple of hours after they had gone to bed with 1 or 2 trips to rock the baby back to sleep. It was exhausting and I wish I could have had some time for myself but it's honestly not really an option sometimes when you have very young kids or baby's. Your husband is feeling like his needs are at the bottom of the pile because honestly they are. The kids will always come first and you are still recovering, it sucks and sometimes the stress can really get to you. Me and the missus have had a few fights about us both feeling at the end of our rope and needing support it's very normal and comes with the territory. I would suggest trying to book a baby sitter or having a family member help out for a few hours if possible so you guys can have a little time to yourselves it makes the world of difference.

Could have done some more as in arranging a baby sitter and ordered out.\n\nBut bashing on her for still being sick feels wrong.\n\nI remember my sister almost dying when she gave birth and how long she took to recover.\n\nNot everyone is the same\n\n\n\nYes she could have done more.\nBut don't slander her for not being well yet", "I think people are missing that it\u2019s common to gift someone fine food, like a box from Omaha Steaks. It\u2019s considered a generous gift", "Yeah this is the big key IMO.\n\nI don't think buying the raw steaks was a problem (I'm giving OP the benefit of the doubt here and assuming she did it because husband likes grilling), but if he doesn't get the chance to actually do it, then what's the point?", "She notes in the OP he's struggling and losing weight.\n\nShe can see it but apparently her needs come first.", "The c-section was planned even. That present and the Father\u2019s Day plan should have been coordinated prior to surgery. I did that for my anniversary that fell a month after a recent surgery.", "Weaponised tears.", "I was thinking the same thing. I was looking to see if anyone who's had a C-section would comment on this. I've had two and I was up and walking around the moment the anastesia wire off. Movement is the best for healing. If she's this hard up, she needs to go back to the MD. She's definitely TA.", "I had a c-section. My daughter was in the NICU for three weeks(born 8 weeks premature). The day after my C-section I was up doing laps around the maternity ward. I was discharged from the hospital 4 days after she was born. The next day I was up walking 10 minutes to the bus stop, taking the bus to and from the hospital every day to be with her. I healed so quickly. The doctors all told me walking was the best thing to heal a c-section as it gets the blood flowing. Sitting around all day is the worst thing you can do. If OP is in that much pain, she definitely needs medical attention. OP is definitely the AH. So much could have been done with a smart phone, on the couch and she didn't even bother to do that. Gross.", "Took way too much scrolling to find a comment like this. My doctors had me up and walking the hallways of the hospital the same day, for both c sections. They tell you to move around. You can\u2019t run a marathon but you aren\u2019t bedridden. And at 4 weeks you are well healed. If Op is in so much pain at 4 weeks that she is immobile all day, she should call her doctor. That doesn\u2019t sound typical.", "I mean I can post my birth records if you want but yes I lost 2.5 litres and did not receive a blood transfusion.\n\nIt was touch and go but they decided it was in my best interest not too.\n\nI very nearly died and am absolutely not \"misrepresenting the situation\" maybe read a medical journal or two before spouting rubbish.", "The nurses at my local maternity ward openly discussed refusing to treat me because I was screaming at the top of my lungs. They scolded me for scaring other women down the corridor, and giving one of the nurses a headache. I was using gas and air and had already had an epidural, but still screaming.\n\nTurns out my daughter had turned so she was facing my hip, which meant her shoulders got stuck. My body didn't register this and kept pushing, so I was literally tearing myself apart.\n\nWe were in that hospital for 9 days, sharing a room with two other new moms. For the first week none of us knew we could leave our children with the nurses and leave the hospital for a short break. I was never shown how to hold my daughter, she was so tiny at just 4lbs 13oz I was afraid of breaking her, instead they accused me of not wanting to hold her. That caused an anxiety attack.\n\nStrangely enough, I now have a fear of hospitals...", "Remember C section cuts through 3 layers - the top dermal and fatty layers, then through the muscle and then into the womb! That's a lot to recover from!", "Your own wife?  For Father\u2019s Day?  If he didn\u2019t ask for it, it was a thoughtless gift.", "No one is missing that at all, they are rightfully criticizing OP for getting him a gift that he couldn't even use and required more work for her husband when he was already feeling like he just needed a break", "Yeah it's fun to stand over the grill and see the food all laid out in front of you.\n\nLike \"Ah yes, I am lord of this domain. Here child, take this bratwurst and half a cob of corn.\"", "Dude. My oldest is 16 and I still sometimes have pain around my scar that can take my breath away. Some people have really smooth easy recoveries and some really don\u2019t. Your assumptions are gross.", "Except in this AITA the father is literally doing all the parenting\u2026", "Ok but is this one of those cases where the man is doing nothing around or are you just getting on your soapbox to spew some casual bigotry?", "Eh. My dad worked a lot up to when I was 10, to the point I might only see him on the weekends sometimes. He still was and is a better parent to me than my mum, who stayed home until I was 3. My mum is a narcissist who sees me as an extension of herself and as her belonging (even now that I'm 35), and my dad is protective, supportive and learns from his mistakes. \nParents are people. There's no rule saying that women are better parents than men. My dad never forgot me and left me stranded because he went to the sauna nor did he forget to pick me up from school and left me there until school closed and they had to tell me to go home somehow.", "In Ireland you're up and walking 6 hours after a c section. I've had 4 and it's never taken more than 2 weeks before I'm back driving and running around after the kids. 3 days after my second son I was hoovering my house. \n\nOP Definitely go get it checked out. It's not normal that a month after a c section you still can't move without so much pain that you're essentially bedbound after picking up something from the floor the day before. I understand not everyone recovers the same but please go see someone. Your husband sounds like he's on the verge of a breakdown", "Or she is lying and being overly dramatic since the husband seems to be doing everything", "I was most definitely not functioning normally after 2 weeks. I tried hard to be, and only ended up setting my actual recovery back. My body has never been the same.  I\u2019m super glad your recovery went well and I\u2019m sure you absolutely busted your tail taking care of your kids. We don\u2019t give moms enough credit for the turnarounds expected of them. \n\nThat\u2019s why I am going to discourage assumptions of \u201cmilking it\u201d applying to women postpartum. It is far harder for some than others, and overall (at least in the USA) most women get inadequate care. Husband needing a break is totally valid, but folks on here condemning her for not planning past steak and cards just makes me sad. My husband and I expected nothing extra from each other for any occasion in the two months after our kids were born. It was too hard on both of us to do anything other than be a team and give each other miles of grace.", "But a lot of traditional mother's day celebrations are centered around allivating the day to day work of being a mother for one day.\n\nAs long as people don't get carried away, I don't see anything wrong with either. After all, a bit of \"spoiling\" is part of a celebration in many respects."]}
