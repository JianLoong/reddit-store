Over that time, his yard business has been extremely successful and he makes a decent amount of money. He has a son, Danny, who was around the same age as my kids Mike and Anna. The kids knew each other growing up and would go to each other's birthday parties, but otherwise weren't super close.\n\nAnna and Danny ended up going to the same college (its a popular one in the state), and eventually announced that they had started dating. Everyone was very excited, and we invited Carlos and his family over for our Christmas dinner that year. It went really well. After a couple of glasses of wine, however, my wife made a couple of jokes regarding our yard being cut for free now. Everyone was uncomfortable and I quickly shut that down and apologized and I figured that would be the end of it.\n\nIt has not been.\n\nAlso, money is not the issue here. but my wife has a tendency to be frivolous in places where it matters and a bit of a cheapskate where it doesn't, and this has become the newest and most shocking instance. This came up every now and then for years until Anna and Danny announced their engagement. All of a sudden, it was like a dam had burst, and my wife became obsessed with the idea of getting free or discounted services, citing that they are now going to be \"family\", and that \"family doesn't charge family\". I finally told her that Danny might come into the family but that Carlos isn't our family, and it is perfectly fine for us to remain close customers to him. I've done absolutely everything I can to keep this away from Carlos, Danny, and Anna.\n\nIt boiled over this morning when Carlos came over with Danny to do some extra tree cutting. We'd negotiated a rate and I had a check already written out. Danny knocked on the door when he was done to get the check and my wife got there while I was in the bathroom. She made a \"joking\" comment to him about already asking for money from the ILs and not even being married yet, and within the hour, I had an enraged call from Anna, and rightfully so.\n\nI argued with my wife about it. It got heated, and I ended up calling her money-crazy, and accusing her of valuing the 150 bucks that today cost over our daughter's happiness. She's convinced that them charging us like \"regular customers\" is the wrong thing to do. More tough words were exchanged, and I ended up refusing to go to our weekly date night until she sent an apology to Danny.\n\nAITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:\n\nI have some information that's been requested.\n\nFirst off, what have we provided to Carlos and Danny? I am a cardiologist and I do actually see Carlos' mother regularly. I can't go into details about that but I do everything that I can to keep costs low and get her in where she otherwise might not be able to due to availability, etc.\n\nSecond, to the people who think I'm agreeing with my wife or haven't told her to stop, I'd like them to reread the post. I've been telling her to stop. \"Just tell her to stop\" is not the all-solving issue. I've expressed (as clearly as I possibly can) that she's doing wrong and she's putting our daughter in a bad situation. That doesn't mean that I can somehow magically force my wife to do something, physically or otherwise. Two wrongs don't make a right.\n\nThird, I want to make it clear that this is the first time that this has really gotten to Carlos or Danny. I have done everything that I can, up until this point, to stop it. I change the subject when I *think* its heading there. I try my best to express why its wrong (see above), and I also am the sole person who deals with Carlos or Danny at this point.

Maybe it's something like a secret debt she's freaking out about or work or something is really eating away at her mental health & to avoid the big issues she's focusing on this little issue where she feels she's in the right & can't let it go.\n\n\nEither way y'all need counseling", "NTA.

I dunno OP, good luck.", "As a long time client, its likely you're already getting a discounted rate...", "I think Carlos will quit.  Then where will your lawn be?  Also he's likely already giving you a discount compared to what he charges his newer clients.  Has he raised his rates 20% in the past two years?", ">She made a \"joking\" comment to him about already asking for money from the ILs and not even being married yet, \n\nI want to point out that this went further than just asking for a discount. She basically accused Danny of being a golddigger here, implying that they'll be asking you for money after marriage.\n\nShe can claim it's a joke, but that's no defence. It's extremely rude and classist. It's doubly galling that she would say that when they are getting paid for their hard work.\n\nSo maybe that's an angle to take to get her to stop - that her comments aren't just entitled, but outright insulting, and is that really the way she wants to be thought of by her new son-in-law? Long term consequences may include your daughter going low contact with her and less time spent with grandchildren, if they have any. Is a discount worth that much to her?", "Can't you just tell her to stop because you'll be paying  him anyway so her 'jokes' are out of place and hurting family members?", "You can switch to a different gardener.

Ask him if he might be willing to swap your address with somebody else. Might be better if y'all are just connected through family and not through business", "Maybe your daughter has to tell her in no uncertain terms that in her opinion she is doing the wrong thing here.\nIt sounds like you\u2019re trying to buffer the agitation from both sides.\nThat\u2019s an awfully nice thing for you to do, but I think it can\u2019t save your family from the eventual blow up. It sounds like rational argument isn\u2019t the way to go with your wife, so the threat of consequences - from your daughter - may be the way to go.\nGood luck :)", "What does your wife do professionally? Maybe she can offer up a barter system and give her own services as a discount as a trade. Otherwise she needs to call tf down. \n\nAlso, even *if* Carlos was willing to entertain the idea of a discount, I can't think of less tactful way of going about bringing it up than how your wife did.

You can\u2019t change someone else\u2019s behavior \u2014 only your own. If I were you I would firmly and openly divest yourself from the things your wife is saying, and let her face the consequences of her own actions. \n\nKeep treating Carlos as a valuable family member who deserves to be paid for the services he provides. You can apologize once to him, Danny, and your daughter on behalf of your wife, but only so they understand you don\u2019t share her views. After that apology, don\u2019t try and mediate. If your wife thinks Danny should work work for free, she can tell him herself; Danny is fully grown and presumably can tear her a new one if he thinks she deserves it. \n\nThis all sucks and I\u2019m really sorry your wife is being such a tool, but I do think there\u2019s very little you can do apart from what you\u2019ve already done and are doing. Your wife *must* be allowed to go off the rails and face the outcome all by herself. If Anna tries to talk to you about it, give her over to your wife and stay out of it. \n\nI hope your wife comes to her senses. And congratulations on your new son-in-law.", "I'm just curious how you know what Carlos makes? Unless he has told you himself, and I'm highly doubtful that he did, you can only guess. Regardless, what he makes is irrelevant. He is doing a service for you and he deserves to get paid. If Carlos told you that from now on all your lawn service needs would be free that's one thing, but it has to come from Carlos. He shouldn't feel guilted or pressured into it.", "Yeah, this is an inbred sense of superiority. It's the mentality that they should be getting more than everyone else or paying less so that they feel like they're always coming out on top and everyone has to know it. It's something you see a lot in certain well off families. At this point you're not going to change her mind. Just let her be TA and shoot herself in the foot with your daughter and new in laws, and make clear to them you will always make sure he is paid.", "Seems to me that you already know your wife is an AH. Hopefully this thread will confirm it for you.", "Yikes! So they all think they are smarter with money than they actually are? A whole family value centered around bullying to get a \"good deal\"?

I'm sure Carlos is doing what any rational, reasonable person does.  He's giving them as big a discount as he can afford, without losing money.\n\nAfter all, he still has to pay for supplies, gas for his work vehicles, his own life expenses, and so on.", "I just had 3 palm trees trimmed took less then an hour and it was $300 so yeah I think they are already getting the \u201cfamily\u201d discount", "This is a really good suggestion.", "My sister is an aesthetician and people are always expecting free treatments or mates rates or whatever with absolutely no consideration for the fact she has overheads and her products and machines and qualifications cost a fortune, even if she's willing to do unpaid labour it's not free!

While  I think  your idea  isn't  bad at all I think  I would  stick to mine so as neither  Carlos  nor especially  Danny can come to the conclusion  that  Anna  knew and didn't  tell her SO right away.

The wife has done a fabulous job of making it uncomfortable already. I think Carlos would actually appreciate OP for having a polite conversation about how much they have appreciated their years of service and how they are ready to transition to just being family/friends.

If OP hires a new gardener, she\u2019s likely to bitch and moan about how they could be getting a \u201cfamily discount\u201d with Carlos. I think the OP is better off being up front with Carlos and Danny and tell them that his wife is a bit wack-a-doodle about insisting on a \u201cfamily discount\u201d and to ignore her.

Not to say SIL hasn\u2019t been taken advantage of either; her ex-stepmother not only expected free bi-weekly trims, she showed up with friends at her salon expecting her to take them right away for free haircuts. SIL half-jokingly talks about how I don\u2019t trust her enough with my hair, but I just want to pay for my haircuts with money and be done with it.", "Not to mention, there's a saying you shouldn't do buisness with family.
