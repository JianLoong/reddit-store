Our friendgroup is otherwise childless. \n\nAll of us used to hang out a lot before the baby was born. Baby changed dynamics because Anna wanted to bring the baby everywhere with her and its a baby. We tried to plan things around baby to include Anna but it always ended up badly. We shouldn't drink, cause Anna can't drink. We shouldn't be loud cause baby needs to sleep. Iceing on the cake is her baby is extremely fussy and cries all the time. It was just a downer for rest of us. So we started hanging out without Anna and her baby. \n\nLast weekend all of us went on a staycation. We had a great time and posted photos and videos on instagram. Anna saw these and called me to ask why I did not ask her to come with. I tried telling her it was a last minute plan and we could only find a childfree resort so as to not hurt her feelings. She called my bluff sending me pics some random family had posted with kids at the resort. \n\nShe kept forcing me and I told her we did not want to hang out with her baby. She asked how can I say that about her baby. \n\nI asked her to leave it at that but she wouldn't. I finally told her its a baby and we are all young. We don't want to live our life around a baby she chose to have. That we get to do adult stuff and party all we wanted. Her baby is the only reason she wasn't invited. If she left baby at home she can come too. \n\nShe got pissed off at me and called me a AH. She also sent a text in group chat saying she is disappointed in all of us for excluding her just because she is a mom. \n\nHalf of our friendgroup thinks I should not have told her the real reason and is mad at me. Other half thinks she is unreasonable. \n\nAITA for telling her the truth?\n\nFrom comments : we have tried to communicate to her about adults only events before. Other than openly saying don't come if you have to bring your baby. \n\nShe refuses to leave baby with her boyfriend or babysitter. Even when we say an event is adults only, like a dinner we had a few weeks ago, she still brought her baby. Baby cried throughout the night earning us glares and we had to leave early.", "created_utc": 1695824744, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16tm1db/aita_for_telling_my_friend_her_baby_is_the_reason/", "score": 8581, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You definitely shouldn't have lied to her, and it blew up in your face. The fact that your half of your other friends are mad you didn't lie even more is such a bad look for them.\n\nFrom her side, when you're all hanging out with the baby, she shouldn't be pressuring the rest of you to be quiet or to not drink. If she doesn't want those things when she's hanging out with you all, she can stay home when that's the plan.\n\nLast note, it sounds bit like you all care more about \"the vibe\" of your friend group more than the friends in it. Like everyone is replaceable. Of course I hope I'm reading way too much into a short text post from a stranger, but I'm just trying to say I hope if she really is your friend that you all actually care about her and her feelings, her family, and make time for them.", "Just because *her* life revolves around baby, doesnt mean all of your lives should revolve around baby, NTA\n\nFellow parent here.

It's pretty crappy that you want to abandon your \"friend\" because she had a baby and is growing up and being more of an adult than y'all. Understandable to not want to be around a baby all the time. But I lost my \"friends\" due to growing up and having responsibilities. And I kept it that way.

As a mom myself, you gotta understand that being a parent isn't everyone else's decision.

Especially when you insist that everyone has to deal with your kid with you whenever they wanna hang out, which is not okay. It\u2019s one thing to bring a baby and hang out and it\u2019s another to expect everyone to tiptoe around said baby. When I had a newborn I also brought them with me everywhere but I never expected people to not drink or be quiet when baby was sleeping (besides saying, \u201cHey be mindful when you walk past that bedroom because he\u2019s napping!\u201d). But you all know if she took that baby on vacation with you guys that she would have expected everyone to go to bed when she wanted, no drinking, and baby-friendly activities. It\u2019s a harsh reality, but your life changes a ton when you become a mom and those who don\u2019t have children don\u2019t understand/don\u2019t have the responsibilities that you do so the dynamic always changes.

In the end, if she wanted to know so badly, well, careful what you wish for. \n\nYou were all at a similar stage of your lives before and now she\u2019s moved to a different stage. Babies change things more than even weddings do. She\u2019ll need to pick her spots when she can arrange babysitting or dropping off the kids with family. At 6 months it\u2019s still a bit difficult, but it does get easier. \n\nKeep in touch with her. When the baby is easier to hand off, she might become more amenable to going out herself again.

Lives change, and not all friendships survive it.", "NTA \n\nThis reminds me a lot of what happened with my sister. She\u2019s 10 years older than me and had her first kid a few years back. Our whole relationship changed. She NEVER left the baby with her husband and it really seemed like she didn\u2019t trust him. It made me not want to hang out with her anymore bc all she talked about was being a mom and everything revolved around her baby, and it still does tbh. I love my nephews but I have no maternal bone in my body and I don\u2019t want kids and I certainly don\u2019t want every conversation to revolve around them. \n\nI think it\u2019s hard on both parties, it\u2019s hard to be a young mom and be the odd one out from your friend group. It sounds like she is too anxious to leave the baby alone. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s been going thru a hard time, but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to accommodate her either. She\u2019ll make friends w new moms and they can talk about their kids and hang out. It might be nice to hang out w her one on one to remind her that you\u2019re still friends and she not being stranded.

Everything you do essentially requires some kind of extended planning. Even if you have in-laws or people close that can help, it's pretty shitty to dump your kids on them without notice for entertainment.

Don't get me wrong, I did see friends her first 3 yrs, BUT it was when they wanted to come over and it was always for just a few hours at my house. I didn't expect everyone to put their lives on hold just because I had a baby. Your friend is being completely unreasonable. She needs to either get comfortable with leaving the baby with its dad, or get comfortable with the idea of not going places because baby comes first.

Social life goes away because of babies. All my friends have kids and with a toddler it\u2019s just not feasible to travel often and any free time you get, you want to sleep or chill out. When baby makes noise at gatherings, she should excuse herself and say maybe next time! Who brings a 6mo old out to adult events anyway? Girl get some sleep when you can. \n\n\n\nShe was not very understanding of the situation. Yes it sucks being excluded from hanging out thanks to the kid, but babysitter, grandparents, etc have to be recruited for that. Parents want to be able to hang out away from baby as well.

He said to her \"If you want to go out, nobody's stopping you, BUT, you must take the baby with you or not go out at all.\" He was a piece of work.\n\nA group of us were in a really nice high-end restaurant having dinner, when she showed up with her baby and gigantic baby carriage.

Fussy babies at most events can really bring the mood down, and that is on the parent for choosing to bring them. It sounds like she has options for free childcare. She should take that option from time to time, not just to give your group a break from a fussy baby but also to give *herself* a break.\n\nMy advice though is to suggest a child friendly event for the whole group including baby on purpose. Preferably something outdoors, like a nature walk or park or something where baby's crying won't be as overwhelming to non parents. Include the new addition on purpose and make sure your friend still feels welcome in the group as a new mom. But also, it's OKAY to have baby-free hangouts and she needs to respect that. I think if you guys plan some events with her baby in mind, it might be easier for her to accept that sometimes you guys want an adults-only event.\n\nAlso \"we can't drink because baby can't drink\" is, I'm sorry, just completely stupid.

It is that people grow apart at different stages in their adults lives, choose different lifestyles, etc. and this also means that their priorities and needs shift. Having four children for example will always be a different lifestyle than choosing to be child free.

Ive gone over to their houses so many times and just watched paw patrol with them and their toddlers and watched the children so their mom can take a shower. Maybe even instead of inviting her to child free stuff they could just go to her house and hang out with her.", "Absolutely. Parenthood is a whole different ballgame, and being the only one in tour friend group to have kids is so isolating. Plus, she's still in that pot partum state so when it comes to wanting to leave her baby... well, it probably isn't easy. Hopefully as she falls into a routine, she will recognize that her being a parent does not mean everyone else around her has to parent as well", "I have a friend with a nearly 2 year old. She drops the baby with other people on occasion. Not everything is baby time.\n\nA few times she's ran late and held up the group because she had to feed or change baby before leaving and handoff took longer and x, y and z. Everyone has been fine with running late because we get the baby has needs she can't ignore. We also are able to hang without the baby around.\n\nIt sucks if you can't find a sitter because your family isn't around, but young people without kids don't want to go to the family fun zone. They probably want to do adult stuff.", "I definitely would have been ordering that glass of wine \ud83c\udf77 and looking her right in the eye while I drank it.", "Because for some reason people think we need to applaud women who have children like it's some noble thing. Maybe that was true a long time ago but now we are totally over populated and killing the earth.", "I don't know why I had to scroll so far to find this.  Whatever is going in in Anna's life, she is clearly struggling to adjust and lacking a support network.  It's wild to me that someone can claim to consider Anna a friend but decide to just exclude her until she can be fun again.  Sounds like a shitty friend tbh.", "> Which it sounds like they tried to do, and the parent ignored, so they didn't invite her. \n\nThe proper way OP should have handled it, after the dinner incident is to tell her, they are planning to go to a resort, she is welcome, her child is not. That they aren't happy with what happened during dinner, where they had to sit through her baby crying all evening, and everyone around them getting annoyed. That, going forward, if we say something is child free, we mean it, or you won't be included at all anymore.", "abusive people have been known to fake all that until they feel their target is trapped.", "Went through this twice as the husband. There\u2019s definitely a phase of quite protective mommying with a newborn that I think makes sense, but it has to end sooner or later for mom\u2019s sanity and dad/baby bonding time. Sometimes you need help seeing it and easing out of it.\n\nMy wife was still playing roller derby when we had our first and was desperate to get back in the game once she recovered enough from labor. But she also struggled with milk production and separation time from the baby. Supplementing worked out fine and gave me a handy dandy freezer of milk bags to mix with formula. The process of getting her out of the house and staying out for the 2-4 hours of derby was harder.\n\nBut she did and it was great for everyone. I got play and bonding time alone with the little one and she got out of the fricken house and kept some piece of her old hobbies and social circles. I think it was an essential step in our parenting since it was all on me to have the baby in same or better condition when she got home, bonus points if they were asleep too! \n\nAlso helps probably that I\u2019m a super solitary person, I loved those nights hanging out with no one else but a tiny newborn. They\u2019re great listeners!", "I do think that refusing to leave your baby alone with its own father for a couple of hours IS helicopter parenting, actually. \n\nI get what you're saying about wanting to be near your six month old, and I agree that part is normal... but considering OP didn't say the father is problematic in any way, this does sound a bit much to me. \n\nHaving the baby's other parent be caregiver for short periods of time should not be a nonstarter.", "https://xkcd.com/1227/", "My daughter was still eating that often at 6 months", "This baby is six months old.  This is not the point in its life where is \"developing social skills.\""]}
