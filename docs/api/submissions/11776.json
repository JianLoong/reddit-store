Been there.\n\nSaying \"you didn't mean any offence\" may be true, but it doesn't address her hurt feelings.\n\nMy husband once explained it to me as \"*Straight Singer, you take pride in your job. Now imagine my mother said, thinking you weren't around, what you do is no big deal, your responsibilities are laughable and your whole career a joke. Now she tell you she means no offense by it. How would you feel?\"*\n\nIn the interest of family harmony, I would offer an apology (and maybe a new Jesus something from a special church or cathedral?) and say it won't happen again. Maybe even offer to go to church with her one Sunday or over Easter. At the end of the day, she is the one who raised your partner.... so she must have done something right. Good luck (I've been there!)", "NAH. I\u2019m a Christian and joke around about church people culture all the time, I wouldn\u2019t take this as mocking religion. It\u2019s just being amused by a quirky collection, and you didn\u2019t intentionally bring it up in front of MIL, so not asshole behavior. But also it\u2019s understandable for her to be upset by someone poking fun at her home, and if religion has been a source of conflict between you in the past of course it\u2019s going to bring up feelings about that.", "NTA \nJesus totally giggled whenever you found him \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude4f", "NAH\n\n\\- You accidentally played the game in front of your MIL.

I don't think so - you weren't doing it (deliberately) in front of your MIL, it's more teasing/poking fun rather than being disrespectful (I'm assuming that the amount of Jesus decor is an individual choice rather than a common cultural practice), you weren't using it as a form of ridicule.

In general, I\u2019d probably reduce the game to a mental tally that can be compared during the ride home. \n\nTheir behavior stems from what they believe to be the ultimate meaning of everything. And in a way, being devout (as awkward as it can make people come across) is commendable because they have 100% buy in to their belief, instead of only practicing when it\u2019s convenient. It\u2019s understandable that they wouldn\u2019t be amused by the game.

She\u2019s not being unreasonable, and I think you know it.  You were making fun of her, and getting her son to make fun of her.

Don't stop playing the game, just be more aware of your surroundings.", "I wish there was an option for \"poor choice\".\n\nYTA extremely extremely lightly.\n\nMaking fun of someone's home in their home is just poor taste. I think your game is hilarious but obviously hurtful in the end, which is uncool.\n\nYour partners parents though can't expect people to like, not notice the extreme amount of Jesus statues. Whether it's a Jesus statue, or a toy horse or a gnome or even a remote control, anything excessive in a house like that is kinda uncomfortable. It's their home and they're allowed to decorate it how they want, but the excessiveness is abnormal. \n\nStill, the right thing to do would be to apologize, and maybe even let her know you really like the statues. You do, just not the same reasons as her.", "I'm gonna say NTA because I would probably do the same thing. Now to be fair, my 3rd grade teacher had a picture of the Virgin Mary with eyes that followed you around on her wall, and it really creeped me out. And for a period when I was 9/10 I hated bathing cuz I didn't want God to see me naked and he sees everything. So yeah, suffice it to say I have some trauma around being watched 24/7, and all the Jesus statues in off places would probably be triggering. Playing a game would probably help me cope.", "NTA but it's funny...", "YTA - but only a little bit.  After reading about your \u201crocky start\u201d and and you specifically mentioning that  \u201cthey had to reckon with their religious beliefs and us.\u201d You probably should have been more respectful of the harmless aspects of their religion, at least while you were in their home. They came a long way to be able to welcome you, and I think poking fun at their religion (even silly, tangential fun) while at their home is a little tacky.\n\nThat being said, it is harmless fun and was genuinely about the iconography more than the religion, with no intention to offend, which is why you\u2019re only the AH a little bit.  In the future, maybe you and your partner can quietly keep count and compare notes on the ride home!", "NAH\n\nYou play a fun harmless game that your partner is fine with you, that brings you both entertainment and has no malicious attempt. You certainly aren\u2019t the AH for making the game and it\u2019s just a question of bad luck and a mind blank moment that you blurted it out at the dinner table. Your partners Mom also isn\u2019t entirely incorrect in being rubbed the wrong way about the game but she didn\u2019t escalate anything to the point where she was the AH. Just keep it to yourself and your partner and you\u2019ll be good.", "NTA.\n\nYou were just playing spot the Jesus. \n\nI\u2019ve just googled and there\u2019s a book called \u2018Finding Jesus\u2019 which is basically a Where\u2019s Wally, with Jesus. \nThere\u2019s also a book called \u2018Where is Jesus hidden?\u2019 on a Catholic book website - and it about spotting Jesus hiding behind furniture. \n\nI don\u2019t get why she was offended.", "NTA. I kind of understand it sticking in the mom\u2019s craw a bit, but it wasn\u2019t like you were really making fun of her religious decorations.

She buys chicken decorations, people gift them to her \u2014 it\u2019s a lot.  My husband and I have joked about the chickens before, but you know where we\u2019ve never joked about it?  In her house, where she could hear us.  That\u2019s just rude.  \n\nYour peek-a-boo Jesus game is hilarious, but it should have stayed between the two of you, and should never have been uttered in her house, where you have now clearly insulted her decorating style.  For that, YTA.", "I think we need more INFO about the rocky start. Was their religion, or yours, a source of conflict between you?", "YTA. Not for creating and playing the game, but you should've been a bit more careful.

She shouldnt be upset, if anything she should find it funny", "Maybe Y T A, but soft.\n\nWas your MIL specifically upset that she felt you disrespected her religion? Or more upset you dissed her decorational style?\n\nI am very religious, and I would not consider playing Peekabo Jesus as disrespectful. Heck, it sounds like a fantastic game to play strolling around, say Rome, or Madrid trying to Peekabo as many Jesuses as possible.\nBut that would be playing it \"out in the wild\", not in someone's home. Peekabo Jesus in the wild sounds awesome, in a home it could be seen as mocking the decor, wich could be sensitive.\n\nI am also an avid Marvel (MCU) fan, and I decorate my house with a lot of MCU-merch, marvel mugs, Marvel posters, Marvel bedsheats, Marvel Pillows, anything MCU, I want it. And if someone made a game of spoting any new merch I put up, I kinda would interpret it as negging my style of decor, an be a bit miffed. I will MCU up my living space as hard as I like, and would hope my guests would refrain from comments please and thank you.\nBut as I said, playing Peekabo MCU in the wild, trying to see most MCU related things, fun game to pass time (although not as good as Peekabo Jesus...)", "For just creating a game? Nope. It\u2019s quite funny and I\u2019m sure entertaining. However, ridiculing someone\u2019s faith, in their own home, without any reason is very much an AH behavior. \n\nAnd for that - YTA", "NTA.

Start new game. Bring a new religious decoration each time you visit. Put it in the weirdest of places. See how many you can get away with. \nNAH here. But OP should apologise", "NTA. Have you ever thought about upping the ante and adding more Jesuses? Jesusi?

Which word do you emphasize, is there a pause?", "NTA I\u2019m positive that Jesus and God have a great sense of humor. they would love to play Peekaboo Jesus with you and your partner if they could. Don\u2019t worry about your in-laws, if they are religious as their displayed memorabilia portray them to be, then you got nothing to worry about because forgiveness is a corner stone of the religion.", "Ding ding ding!! \n\nIt costs exactly zero dollars and zero cents to keep your mouth shut in someone else's home. \n\nAnd getting their son in on it too. That's a double slap in the face. \n\nMocking something that is clearly meaningful, in their own home for crying out loud. \n\nKids lack basic tact. \n\nBut that said, by all means take pictures of the latest Peekaboo Jesus and compare notes when you get home!!", "Appease the religious nutjobs is not the best answer.", "Heck maybe even a Precious Moments thing. Depending on region and denomination, that may mean a lot to MIL too.", "Oh, this is interesting! My mother, who was a Protestant, once saw a menorah in an antiques shop/ flea market and she bought it when she was with my Catholic father. It now sits on a shelf in my atheist home. I actually googled whether there's any protocols on how to clean it respectfully, because with google that sort of information became available easily.  \n\n\nEDITed to add: she bought it in the late 70s, or early 80s.

Let me tell you some stories about my family, to prove it!  ;)\n\nThat said, there's a difference between having a sense of humor about a situation, and insulting your MIL over something that's obviously very meaningful to her.\n\nCase in point: On Reddit, everyone always says, : \"It's not a joke if everyone isn't laughing!\" A statement that I agree with.  So, does that statement not apply if it's targeting a religious person? That's a genuine question.\n\nAnd again, let the downvotes begin, because heaven forbids anyone disagrees with Reddit.", "Your first sentence? Yep. That is an exact paraphrase of what I said.

It's God's comedy channel.", "I don't believe it was a joke when said in front of MIL, because you're right, she wasn't laughing. And OP acknowledged that and apologized. Should be a done deal.\n\nBut I also think MIL needs to lighten up. Perhaps learn how to laugh at her own foibles. Doesn't mean she has to change her habits, obviously, & she can still collect as many religious symbols as she wants. But she should acknowledge to herself that it is NOT 'normal' (in the sense that it's something everyone does), so when people notice it, they will likely think it unique. She should learn to embrace her uniqueness of being the person with the 'Peekaboo Jesus' house. That way the not-a-joke could become a special inside-joke with her son and OP. Especially if she'd like for her son to embrace religion more (which, since she is so devout, I would imagine she does). The surest way for anyone to drive someone *away* from religion is to make that religion judgmental against the person. The surest way to attract them is to make the religion welcoming.", "jesus tax", "I'll have her take one.", "My daughter has it hanging in her living room.

In the same you you don't have to if someone tells a woman to cover up or a gay couple to stop holding hands because it insults their sensibilities.

Surely this applies here as well, no?", "I think an important difference is that they didn\u2019t tease her about it and mention it directly to her.

That's like saying you have the right to be offended that I said hello to you as I passed you on the street. Sure, you are *allowed* to be offended, but that doesn't mean my greeting was offensive. Intent or not, \"hello\" is just objectively NOT offensive. I argue the same is true for \"peekaboo\". It's not about intent.", "Why?
