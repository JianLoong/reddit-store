Nice cut of skirt steak, around $25\n\nI begun cooking us a nice steak dinner so that it would be ready shortly after she got home and when she came home she was not pleased. I\u2019m a fairly good cook and cook for us often, and have made good steaks plenty of times.\n\nTo be fair, I\u2019m sure that she was expecting a couple of more traditional cuts of steak like a new york or filet or something. You know, more traditional steak preparation. Salt, pepper, butter kind of thing. I had considered this while shopping for the cut of steak but still met her criteria and was looking forward to making us a nice dinner. TJ\u2019s generally has great pre marinated meats and I thought it would be a fun switch up (and easier/quicker to prepare) while still being a good steak dinner! \n\nShe either didn\u2019t understand it was a different cut of steak and thought it was some cheap Asian beef dish, or didn\u2019t like the actual final result (I enjoyed it) but regardless she was not pleased. If she didn\u2019t enjoy the Trader Joe\u2019s marinated steak I\u2019m totally fine with that, no skin off my back, but she seemed to be disappointed and mad with me which is what bothered me when we could have enjoyed a nice steak dinner (not \u201csteak dinner\u201d according to her) even if it\u2019s not what she had in mind\n\nTl;dr made skirt steak in Asian marinade when my girlfriend requested a steak dinner, she evidently had a different steak preparation in mind and was not pleased \n\nAm I the asshole here?

While I do agree with everyone that you cooking a nice steak dinner was a really awesome thing to do, you did also say that you knew this wasn't what she meant when she said a steak dinner. So I say you were a bit of an ah for being disingenuous about the expectations of a steak dinner and using the vagueness of the text as a way to technically do what was asked even if it wasn't how it was intended. Again you still made dinner which was awesome but I can see how your gf was disappointed especially if she knows you knew what she meant.", "Sounds like you know the answer and are trying to \u201cskirt\u201d by on technicalities. See what I did there. \n\nYou say you knew what she meant by wanting steak, and you decided not to do it. A steak dinner and a steak stir fry are very different. You could have texted her? \n\nWhether or not she overreacted is a different issue, but you\u2019re being squirrelly with your language and trying to convince us you\u2019re right even though you know what she wanted, so I\u2019m going to say YTA.", "Info: what did she actually say. I read a lot of assumptions on your part, see seemed disappointed and mad? Has she expressed that she prefers a certain cut in the past?", "NTA.  It\u2019s easy to see why you interpreted her text the way you did.  It was generally worded\u2026nothing specific in what kind of meat she wanted or how it was to be made.  The fact that she was mad after all the preparation and cooking you did just screams entitlement.   She should\u2019ve been happy at all the work you did.  I don\u2019t get it.", "I\u2019m going with NTA but it also is weird to me that your wording includes so many phrases speculating about how she \u201cseemed\u201d to feel, etc. Did you ask her how she felt, and explain your reasoning? It seems like if you just had an open conversation about this, it probably doesn\u2019t need to be a big deal. If she really wants to be treated with a more traditional steak dinner then surely you can just do that next time, and no harm done?", "Hmm.  I think that if I were looking forward to a tasty medium-rare steak, with chunky potato chips, mushrooms, and a green vegetable, and perhaps even a fancy sauce on the side, I'd be disappointed with a meal that wasn't exactly that, however delicious.  If you have a yen for something particular to eat, a substitute doesn't satisfy it.\n\nYou knew what she was actually asking for, didn't you?  Nobody seriously interprets \"a steak dinner\" as \"anything made with steak\".  I mean, sure, the dinner sounds really good, but it was not what she had asked for, was it?  You know this.\n\nYTA", "I was toying with N A H, but I am going to go slightly with YTA here.\n\nI was initially looking at it as a miscommunication, in which no one is at fault, that she said Steak and that clearly meant something different to her and you. The reason I have gone with YTA in the end is because you have said that while looking for the steak, that you clearly considered whether what you were looking at met her expectations and at the end of the day you knew it didn't really and what she meant, and went for it anyway because technically it is still Steak.\n\nI don't like Steak personally, but if I did and had built that in my head as my nice dinner at the end of the day (in the more expected, sirloin, bit of seasoning and not much else), I'd probably be a bit disappointed too if that wasn't what I got, even if the actual meal had been lovely.\n\nThere isn't anything wrong with trying something new or switching it up, but either ask or at least give her a heads up next time.", "NTA though I can see her disappointment if she was expecting no marinade and a different cut of steak maybe with a seasoning rub. But she should specify if her craving is that specific. \n\nI'd just be happy that someone was cooking for me :-)", "I might be looking way too into this, but I feel not only are you TA, but you\u2019re also gaslighting your girlfriend by getting the opinions of strangers to make your case for you:\n\nThis title is misleading. It should read: \u201cAITA for deliberately ignoring my girlfriends dinner request?\u201d\n\nCooking for someone else is an incredibly nice thing to do for someone so on the surface, people want to say NTA, however, there are a few times where you outright admit your fault\u2026\n\n\u201cTo be fair, I\u2019m sure she was expecting\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI had considered this while shopping\u2026\u201d\n\nSo you knew what she wanted and went the other way. Great job", "INFO: what do you mean by she \u201cseemed to be disappointed and mad\u201d? Did she do something here? Of course you\u2019re not TA, but I don\u2019t actually see what she did wrong either. She\u2019s allowed to be disappointed, but did she treat you poorly? Did she take it out on you? What exactly did she do?", "NAH - she gave you ingredients, you combined them into a meal.  She did probably assume that you were going to make like a strip or ribeye or something along those lines.  I won't lie, if someone  said to me make steak for dinner or come over were having steaks a skirt steak would probably be the last cut I'd think of.", "Has she had sesame teriyaki marinated steaks previously?", "YTA\n\nNot for not cooking what she wanted, but you\u2019ve been together for around 5 years. You either know damn well what type of meal she was craving from her \u201csteak dinner\u201d text and you\u2019re just playing dumb because you felt like something else OR you didn\u2019t know and didn\u2019t bother checking/asking for clarification, still knowing damn well you two might not be on the same page. \n\nYTA not for the food itself, but for being with someone for 5 years and not knowing how to properly communicate with your partner, then coming on Reddit and trying to do \u201cwell but AcTuALLy its TeChNiCaLLy steak\u201d bit to shred off responsibility.

Instead of asking her to clarify if you were really unsure, you used the vagueness of her text as an excuse to make a faster dinner that was more to your taste when it\u2019s her birthday request", "NTA.   \nDinner sounded delucious.\n\nThat was pretty rude of her.", "Soft YTA because you seemed to have known what she meant and went another direction on purpose. What you made sounds great, but I think you knew beforehand that what you made wasn\u2019t what she meant.", ">To be fair, I\u2019m sure that she was expecting a couple of more traditional cuts of steak like a new york or filet or something.\n\nSo, you knew what she was expecting, and yet you decided against what you knew she wanted? That's not a misinterpretation. That's a conscious choice to ignore your partners wishes and preferences, and that makes YTA.\n\nShe's right. A cheap cut of meat smothered in an overpowering sauce is not a \"nice steak dinner.\" I'm not surprised that she's disappointed. Are there other examples of when you disappointed her because you figured \"technically it's close enough to what I know she wanted\"?", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut\u2026I\u2019ve been your wife before. My guess is she had a shit day, was hungry and was craving a delicious steak you\u2019ve made in the past. And probably fair for her to expect that if that is how you have consistently made in the past. Then we she got home she was all excited about the one thing she has been looking forward to for hours only to find a subpar version of it and she just feels like this is one more thing that didn\u2019t work out for her today. She is clearly wrong, she Knows she is wrong, but she is disappointed. That being said, if that steak was prepared in something you know she does not like (like excessively spicy seasoning, for example) and you bought it anyway knowing this, then YTA because you know her and should know better than that.", "Gunna go with NTA \n\nHer behavior was ungrateful and rude. She could have easily said, \"You know, I didn't love that marinated steak. Let's do something else next time.\" Totally out of line for her to actually get mad about this. \n\nBut if you knew what she meant by a \"steak dinner\" why did you go off script? If you'd checked with her beforehand, this entire situation would have been avoided. I don't think this makes you an asshole. You just didn't think things through.", "Yta. You knew it wasn't what she wanted you just didn't care.", "NTA\n\nJust wanted to add that skirt steak is my favourite cut and I\u2019d be very happy if my partner made that for me. \n\n1. You were so thoughtful to cook everything in time for her to get home \u2764\ufe0f\n2. Skirt is a delicious cut of steak, teriyaki marinade is yummy. \n3. It\u2019s really not that big of a deal and the fact she is having a whinge is kinda hilarious. If she was craving something very specific then she should of; communicated exactly what she wanted or organised it herself. \n\nThere\u2019s always tomorrow if it didn\u2019t hit the spot and it\u2019s only steak.", "YTA, who thinks Asian marinade when as asking for a steak?? You also knew what she meant and still got the Asian marinade. You also could have easily texted her and asked hey this is a new marinade, would you like it? Most people only put butter, salt, and pepper on their steaks or have a pretty western marinade. Asian flavors are super distinct.", "I'll be honest...If you were a woman saying this about your male partner, I'd assume he was an entitled little prick. But because the genders are reversed, I'm going to assume she's an entitled little prick.\n\nThere's no standard, universally accepted definition of 'steak dinner'. She got steak, broccoli and asparagus - what she asked for with the exception of the marinade, which she didn't specifically say she wanted/didn't want.\n\nGod forbid it was some 'cheap Asian beef dish'. Didn't realise steak dinners were a flex but regardless, this is stupid. You're NTA.", "NTA and wtf is wrong with commenters? You cooked a nice meal and she's pissy because it not exactly the way she imagined it?\n\nYou cooked, it was edible, any other reaction then \"Thanks Honey\" is selfish and entitled.", "NTA - The YTA comments on this post are a little strange to me. One miscommunication about a steak dinner does not make you an asshole. Yes, maybe you could have cleared things up with her about what she wanted... but she could have done the same. \n\nThis is a very minor thing and if she's making a big deal about it then I think that's a little unfair after you went through a lot of effort to prepare her a nice meal. I'm sure this issue can easily be solved with a quick conversation about being more specific when requesting meals in future. It's not that deep.\n\nSide note: It's only an easy conversation if you approach it in the right way. Just acknowledge that she was disappointed and figure out what the solution is to prevent this from happening in the future.", "You did groceries and cooked a meal, ready for when she got him.\n\nWhat's not to like?\n\nNTA", "**NTA** \n\nYou bought and cooked dinner!", "NAH.

Probably closer to NAH.\n\nI will say that in my country the pre-marinated steak at the store is probably the worst meat you can buy in the store. It's always the worst cut of meat that they are trying to hide behind the marinade, but it's also marinated so long that it completely messes with the texture of the meat. Shit is so nasty. Not sure about the texture/quality where you live. \n\nIf I was asked specifically what I wanted for dinner, and then didn't get that but some other variation, I'd probably be slightly annoyed too. I think we all know the feeling of being excited for a particular meal, especially after a long day, and then when it's not what you hoped for it can be disappointing. \n\nAll in all not really a big deal, unless this is a pattern of misinterpreting wishes/requests then I guess you've got a bigger issue on your hands.", "NTA but a skirt steak is a pretty crappy cut of meat", "NTA\n\nIf she can't communicate her issues with the meal like a grown-up then I wouldn't worry about it.

What if I chucked my phone over the overpass and onto the street below?\n\nAll questions thrown into the void, not expecting to be reality.", "You agree that it was about his preference, not hers.", "Because someone cooked her dinner, in time for her getting home.

And if you aren't, you are a fucking asshole.", "Beef teriyaki in it's various forms is pretty common (along Chicken, Salmon, Tofu is in the top 5 for most common base ingredient in a Teriyaki dish).\n\nI understand it you might not like the sound of it, but it's hardly at the Haggis / Quail eggs end of the weird food spectrum - it came from TJs after all.\n\nOver here its served in most Japanese restaurants, as a cultural equivalent of a normal steak dish", "I mean, if she isnt then she\u2019s just an AH. \u201cMy partner did not cook me the exact type of dinner I wanted despite me contributing nothing more than a vaguely worded request\u201d is an absolutely absurd reason to be unhappy.", ">but still met her criteria and was looking forward to making us a nice dinner. TJ\u2019s generally has great pre marinated meats and I thought it would be a fun switch up (and easier/quicker to prepare) while still being a good steak dinner! \n\nHe also said that the new cut met her criteria. If she strictly want some types of steaks, she's the one that should communicate that. \n\n>When my husband and I cook for each other, we care enough to actually agree on what we're cooking and communicate any changes.\n\nBut would you flip out on your husband when he made what you asked but not exactly what you wanted because you were vague  about it?", "Firstly, what I wrote was a fact. She asked for A, B, and C. She got A, B, and C. \n\nSecondly, she was the one being obnoxious and smug when she herself couldn't deliver her request clearly but had the nerve to criticise her partner when things didn't go the exact way that she wanted. \n\nFinally. I'm not her freaking bf, I can be obnoxious and smug to her all I want (and what i said wasn't even obnoxious and smug \ud83e\udd14).

Not a specific kind... like ribeye.", "That's assumption from me. I have never seen skirt steak, especially marinated skirt steak, not end up on a plate sliced up. Skirt steak can be kinda tough so marinade and thin slices help it.", "Fair enough but it\u2019s still a pretty common cut. I would agree if he made Osso Bucco or something that\u2019s definitely not a steak.\n\nBut even then it\u2019s pretty ungrateful. He\u2018s not a restaurant\u2026\n\nAnyway, a good skirt is delicious\u2026", "Because it\u2019s premade?

If it were me I probably wouldn't be able to eat that dish because I can only eat steak in a specific way. \n\nIt wasn't just \"oh I used garlic salt instead of regular salt on the steak\" it was making a totally different meal with a very different flavor and texture. \n\nHe also didn't bother giving her a heads up that it wouldn't actually be a traditional steak, or ask if it were ok to do. If he didn't want to make the meal she wanted he didn't have to but why pretend like he would but then change it up so much?", "Totally. Nothing in the original request requires more than a few minutes of prep. \n\nI think AH is a bit strong here. But this whole thing has the same vibes as a kid who asks for hamburgers and a mom who buys tofu burgers instead. Nothing wrong with a tofu burger, but we all know the kid won't be happy with the substitution.", "My picky, slightly princess-y take is that the Trader Joe\u2019s marinades are terrible as well. Too much sugar/salt/oil.

This is exactly how I\u2019d phrase the request I wanted for a specific dinner I was craving. Wouldn\u2019t be mad if they said nah let\u2019s do that later this week or I\u2019m not up to cooking tonight.", "Is that illegal? He\u2019s eating it too. He\u2019s not a restaurant; surely, he\u2019s allowed some input.", "It was still steak. Just s cut and marinade different than usual (I guess). It was last minute ask. After HE had a long day at work. So he had to go out of his way to buy, prep, and cook it. So yeah, choosing the steak that speaks more to you is a small ask. \n\nIf she wanted a specific cut of steak? You get it yourself and cook it. Or you plan it out.", "No babe. That\u2019s not how it works.\n\nIf someone is cooking me food it needs to be food I enjoy or I\u2019ll cook for myself. \n\nIf I ask for a particular meal I\u2019m not going to be grateful for a sabotaged version. \n\nIf I order food at a restaurant and they get the order wrong the whole plate goes back. Op should be great full she didn\u2019t pass the plate back to him.", "It didn't meet her criteria because he knew what she was talking about and did something different. If he were an Instacart driver that would be one thing but he's known her 5+ years.\n\nI don't see where she \"flipped out\". He says she's mad and disappointed. And yes, if I asked for something and my husband agreed to do it but then knowingly did something different. I would be upset. And so would he if the shoe was on the other foot. But that doesn't happen because we respect each other and care enough to communicate. If one of us is unclear, we ask for clarification. Simple.", "Absolutely not. I do it to my fianc\u00e9 all the time. He\u2019s a picky turd who was never forced to try or eat anything other then your average 4 items on a kids menu. \n\nSo yeah, I toss things in and try something new without asking him. Turns out he likes sushi, ravioli, ahi tuna, asparagus, and so much more. And he\u2019s none the wiser I blend shit like mushrooms or spinach into things like spaghetti sauce bc I worry about his nutrition. \n\nHe understands that this is compromise bc I like a wide variety and it\u2019s not fair to me to have to limit myself but also not fair to make him eat things he doesn\u2019t like. \n\nTheres men smacking their women, verbally abusing them, their kids, being dead beats and all this man did is get a different kind of steak to change things up. Not even worth an argument", "She asked for a, b and c, he got her a, b, c, and then smothered it in d, which she didn\u2019t ask for.

The acidity and salt content of the soy sauce in the teriyaki sauce chances the texture as well as the cut of the meat.\n\nAnd sometimes we buying these they cut them the wrong grain way and it's tougher and harder to chew.\n\nOvercooking meat is a crime, why kill an animal if you're going to over season it and choke it down?", "Are you implying I'm racist if I don't like certain foods from different cultures?", "Maybe she should've cooked it herself then.", "Well, she didn\u2019t say that she only wanted *any* particular preparation at all? \n\nI mean if I text my boyfriend \u201cI want chicken for dinner\u201d without any additional info, I\u2019m not going to be aghast to find he fried it, grilled it, topped it with a teriyaki glaze, or baked it with simple pan sauce. Whatever he does, if it\u2019s chicken, he followed the prompt. If I *say* that I was grilled chicken, and come home to fried- then I have a leg to stand on.", "But he might have thought she would like to try something new? I would have, if I were his girlfriend and I don't need to be noticed beforehand", "Yes. We don't have Trader Joe's here but I never buy pre-marinaded meat as homemade is always superior. Not knocking people who buy it as there are many reasons, from preference, time, ability etc. But I wouldn't be pleased to be served it up if steak was requested, when a steak in butter and herbs is as quick and easy to do and vastly more delicious!", "Nailed it. I read this and thought gross, I wouldn't have eaten it. Asia is a continent not a cuisine. Trader Joes' vague hodgepodge of cultures in their marketing is as gross as the culinary results.", "He plainly acknowledged it's not what she wanted. \n\nHe did what he wanted without asking her for her input", "But he acknowledged what the correct cut of steak was that she wanted. He chose to ignore that thought and do what he wanted", "He\u2019s not a restaurant, lmfao. At a restaurant, you order and the food is prepared in a kitchen for you, and exclusively for you. \n\nIn a household, you can\u2019t just give someone orders and expect them to ignore what they want completely, unless it\u2019s your birthday or some special occasion/celebration. And, even then, a little gratitude doesn\u2019t kill anyone. \n\nFor instance, it\u2019s a parent\u2019s obligation to provide food for their child. When my parents cooked for me, even if it wasn\u2019t something I particularly wanted, I made sure to express my appreciation, especially if it was well-prepared.

Bet she also wouldn't be happy with that.", ">Because that one is Sesame Teriyaki Skirt **Steak**\n\naka Steak. You yourself also acknowledged it as a Steak", "What?", "She might have if he told her what he was getting.", "Maybe op should've done it the way he acknowledged was what she wanted", "I'd say most people are going to be disappointed when they get something different from what they were expecting. And they've been together 5 years, surely he knows she's not someone who is okay with that. He knew what she meant by steak, he chose to do something else. Just because you're so easy going it wouldn't be an issue doesn't mean she's in the wrong for being disappointed", "He literally used the ingredients she wanted. Disregarding her preferences would have been going out and buying chicken instead of steak and carrots instead of broccoli. This is silly. Since when are people entitled to exactly what they want and whenever they want it?", "And why not? Why does he have to sacrifice what he wants? It's hid time and money.", "The words in front mean something too buckaroo \n\nAll squares are rectangles but not all rectangles are squares", "Why did you ask if I don't like it because it's Asian?", "Op is the one who went to do the shopping after work, the one who did the cooking,  etc. If he wanted to cook something faster this one time, why do her wants matter more than his?\n\nI legit don't understand why her entitlement is getting a pass. There's no way my husband and I would get angry at each other over something like this, we'd still be grateful to each other for taking the time to cook and have the food ready.", "But OP mentions she is mad. That is something different then (slightly) disappointed, which I can imagine. After all, a nice dinner was cooked for her. A more mature approach would have been something like \"Thanks for making dinner. It was nice to try something else for a change, but I like our usual steak dinners better.\" Which is a valid respons when trying something new", "Your rationale applies to op", "He doesn't imply it's a sacrifice for him to eat the steak she wanted", "Steak and Sesame Teriyaki Skirt Steak are not squares and rectangles.\n\nA correct comparison would be Sesame Teriyaki Skirt Steak being squares and Steak being shapes, which include squares.", "Because that implies certain flavors you might no like?", "Op is the entitled one", "You're getting hung up on one word when OP doesn't even elaborate on it. And to her, it wasn't a nice dinner. To her someone lied that they were making a dish she'd look forward to.", "Not really. He bought the ingredients she asked for and prepared something with it, albeit something slightly different. But he did consider her wants. He expect a meal suited to his particular tastes to appear when he requested it. He cooked the thing, for God\u2019s sake. And he used ingredients she asked for. \n\nShe\u2019s pouting now. \n\nI just don\u2019t think you can ever ask someone to cook for you and expect it to be just how you like it.

You honestly think you've satisfied the requirements of buying pepper?", "I don't like any marinades"]}
