Nice cut of skirt steak, around $25\n\nI begun cooking us a nice steak dinner so that it would be ready shortly after she got home and when she came home she was not pleased. I\u2019m a fairly good cook and cook for us often, and have made good steaks plenty of times.\n\nTo be fair, I\u2019m sure that she was expecting a couple of more traditional cuts of steak like a new york or filet or something. You know, more traditional steak preparation. Salt, pepper, butter kind of thing. I had considered this while shopping for the cut of steak but still met her criteria and was looking forward to making us a nice dinner.

While I do agree with everyone that you cooking a nice steak dinner was a really awesome thing to do, you did also say that you knew this wasn't what she meant when she said a steak dinner. So I say you were a bit of an ah for being disingenuous about the expectations of a steak dinner and using the vagueness of the text as a way to technically do what was asked even if it wasn't how it was intended. Again you still made dinner which was awesome but I can see how your gf was disappointed especially if she knows you knew what she meant.\n\nETA: damn this thread had devolved into something lol. I still stand by my judgment but some of you defending OP seem to be protecting hard. If anything it had made me feel like he was more of an AH than before.", "Sounds like you know the answer and are trying to \u201cskirt\u201d by on technicalities. See what I did there. \n\nYou say you knew what she meant by wanting steak, and you decided not to do it. A steak dinner and a steak stir fry are very different. You could have texted her? \n\nWhether or not she overreacted is a different issue, but you\u2019re being squirrelly with your language and trying to convince us you\u2019re right even though you know what she wanted, so I\u2019m going to say YTA.", "Info: what did she actually say. I read a lot of assumptions on your part, see seemed disappointed and mad? Has she expressed that she prefers a certain cut in the past?", "NTA.  It\u2019s easy to see why you interpreted her text the way you did.  It was generally worded\u2026nothing specific in what kind of meat she wanted or how it was to be made.  The fact that she was mad after all the preparation and cooking you did just screams entitlement.   She should\u2019ve been happy at all the work you did.  I don\u2019t get it.", "I\u2019m going with NTA but it also is weird to me that your wording includes so many phrases speculating about how she \u201cseemed\u201d to feel, etc. Did you ask her how she felt, and explain your reasoning? It seems like if you just had an open conversation about this, it probably doesn\u2019t need to be a big deal. If she really wants to be treated with a more traditional steak dinner then surely you can just do that next time, and no harm done?", "Hmm.  I think that if I were looking forward to a tasty medium-rare steak, with chunky potato chips, mushrooms, and a green vegetable, and perhaps even a fancy sauce on the side, I'd be disappointed with a meal that wasn't exactly that, however delicious.  If you have a yen for something particular to eat, a substitute doesn't satisfy it.\n\nYou knew what she was actually asking for, didn't you?  Nobody seriously interprets \"a steak dinner\" as \"anything made with steak\".  I mean, sure, the dinner sounds really good, but it was not what she had asked for, was it?  You know this.\n\nYTA", "I was toying with N A H, but I am going to go slightly with YTA here.\n\nI was initially looking at it as a miscommunication, in which no one is at fault, that she said Steak and that clearly meant something different to her and you. The reason I have gone with YTA in the end is because you have said that while looking for the steak, that you clearly considered whether what you were looking at met her expectations and at the end of the day you knew it didn't really and what she meant, and went for it anyway because technically it is still Steak.\n\nI don't like Steak personally, but if I did and had built that in my head as my nice dinner at the end of the day (in the more expected, sirloin, bit of seasoning and not much else), I'd probably be a bit disappointed too if that wasn't what I got, even if the actual meal had been lovely.\n\nThere isn't anything wrong with trying something new or switching it up, but either ask or at least give her a heads up next time.", "NTA though I can see her disappointment if she was expecting no marinade and a different cut of steak maybe with a seasoning rub. But she should specify if her craving is that specific. \n\nI'd just be happy that someone was cooking for me :-)", "I might be looking way too into this, but I feel not only are you TA, but you\u2019re also gaslighting your girlfriend by getting the opinions of strangers to make your case for you:\n\nThis title is misleading. It should read: \u201cAITA for deliberately ignoring my girlfriends dinner request?\u201d\n\nCooking for someone else is an incredibly nice thing to do for someone so on the surface, people want to say NTA, however, there are a few times where you outright admit your fault\u2026\n\n\u201cTo be fair, I\u2019m sure she was expecting\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI had considered this while shopping\u2026\u201d\n\nSo you knew what she wanted and went the other way. Great job", "INFO: what do you mean by she \u201cseemed to be disappointed and mad\u201d? Did she do something here? Of course you\u2019re not TA, but I don\u2019t actually see what she did wrong either. She\u2019s allowed to be disappointed, but did she treat you poorly? Did she take it out on you? What exactly did she do?", "NAH - she gave you ingredients, you combined them into a meal.  She did probably assume that you were going to make like a strip or ribeye or something along those lines.  I won't lie, if someone  said to me make steak for dinner or come over were having steaks a skirt steak would probably be the last cut I'd think of.", "Has she had sesame teriyaki marinated steaks previously?", "YTA\n\nNot for not cooking what she wanted, but you\u2019ve been together for around 5 years. You either know damn well what type of meal she was craving from her \u201csteak dinner\u201d text and you\u2019re just playing dumb because you felt like something else OR you didn\u2019t know and didn\u2019t bother checking/asking for clarification, still knowing damn well you two might not be on the same page. \n\nYTA not for the food itself, but for being with someone for 5 years and not knowing how to properly communicate with your partner, then coming on Reddit and trying to do \u201cwell but AcTuALLy its TeChNiCaLLy steak\u201d bit to shred off responsibility. You didn\u2019t even have to cook the damn dinner she wanted, didn\u2019t even have to leave the house to shop and do all that!

Instead of asking her to clarify if you were really unsure, you used the vagueness of her text as an excuse to make a faster dinner that was more to your taste when it\u2019s her birthday request", "NTA.   \nDinner sounded delucious.\n\nThat was pretty rude of her.", "Soft YTA because you seemed to have known what she meant and went another direction on purpose. What you made sounds great, but I think you knew beforehand that what you made wasn\u2019t what she meant.", ">To be fair, I\u2019m sure that she was expecting a couple of more traditional cuts of steak like a new york or filet or something.\n\nSo, you knew what she was expecting, and yet you decided against what you knew she wanted? That's not a misinterpretation. That's a conscious choice to ignore your partners wishes and preferences, and that makes YTA.\n\nShe's right. A cheap cut of meat smothered in an overpowering sauce is not a \"nice steak dinner.\" I'm not surprised that she's disappointed. Are there other examples of when you disappointed her because you figured \"technically it's close enough to what I know she wanted\"?", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut\u2026I\u2019ve been your wife before. My guess is she had a shit day, was hungry and was craving a delicious steak you\u2019ve made in the past. And probably fair for her to expect that if that is how you have consistently made in the past. Then we she got home she was all excited about the one thing she has been looking forward to for hours only to find a subpar version of it and she just feels like this is one more thing that didn\u2019t work out for her today. She is clearly wrong, she Knows she is wrong, but she is disappointed. That being said, if that steak was prepared in something you know she does not like (like excessively spicy seasoning, for example) and you bought it anyway knowing this, then YTA because you know her and should know better than that.", "Gunna go with NTA \n\nHer behavior was ungrateful and rude. She could have easily said, \"You know, I didn't love that marinated steak. Let's do something else next time.\" Totally out of line for her to actually get mad about this. \n\nBut if you knew what she meant by a \"steak dinner\" why did you go off script? If you'd checked with her beforehand, this entire situation would have been avoided. I don't think this makes you an asshole. You just didn't think things through.", "Yta. You knew it wasn't what she wanted you just didn't care.", "NTA\n\nJust wanted to add that skirt steak is my favourite cut and I\u2019d be very happy if my partner made that for me. \n\n1. You were so thoughtful to cook everything in time for her to get home \u2764\ufe0f\n2. Skirt is a delicious cut of steak, teriyaki marinade is yummy. \n3. It\u2019s really not that big of a deal and the fact she is having a whinge is kinda hilarious. If she was craving something very specific then she should of; communicated exactly what she wanted or organised it herself. \n\nThere\u2019s always tomorrow if it didn\u2019t hit the spot and it\u2019s only steak.", "YTA, who thinks Asian marinade when as asking for a steak?? You also knew what she meant and still got the Asian marinade. You also could have easily texted her and asked hey this is a new marinade, would you like it? Most people only put butter, salt, and pepper on their steaks or have a pretty western marinade. Asian flavors are super distinct.", "I'll be honest...If you were a woman saying this about your male partner, I'd assume he was an entitled little prick. But because the genders are reversed, I'm going to assume she's an entitled little prick.\n\nThere's no standard, universally accepted definition of 'steak dinner'. She got steak, broccoli and asparagus - what she asked for with the exception of the marinade, which she didn't specifically say she wanted/didn't want.\n\nGod forbid it was some 'cheap Asian beef dish'. Didn't realise steak dinners were a flex but regardless, this is stupid. You're NTA.", "NTA and wtf is wrong with commenters? You cooked a nice meal and she's pissy because it not exactly the way she imagined it?\n\nYou cooked, it was edible, any other reaction then \"Thanks Honey\" is selfish and entitled.", "NTA - The YTA comments on this post are a little strange to me. One miscommunication about a steak dinner does not make you an asshole. Yes, maybe you could have cleared things up with her about what she wanted... but she could have done the same. \n\nThis is a very minor thing and if she's making a big deal about it then I think that's a little unfair after you went through a lot of effort to prepare her a nice meal. I'm sure this issue can easily be solved with a quick conversation about being more specific when requesting meals in future. It's not that deep.\n\nSide note: It's only an easy conversation if you approach it in the right way. Just acknowledge that she was disappointed and figure out what the solution is to prevent this from happening in the future.", "You did groceries and cooked a meal, ready for when she got him.\n\nWhat's not to like?\n\nNTA", "**NTA** \n\nYou bought and cooked dinner!", "NAH.

Probably closer to NAH.\n\nI will say that in my country the pre-marinated steak at the store is probably the worst meat you can buy in the store. It's always the worst cut of meat that they are trying to hide behind the marinade, but it's also marinated so long that it completely messes with the texture of the meat. Shit is so nasty. Not sure about the texture/quality where you live. \n\nIf I was asked specifically what I wanted for dinner, and then didn't get that but some other variation, I'd probably be slightly annoyed too. I think we all know the feeling of being excited for a particular meal, especially after a long day, and then when it's not what you hoped for it can be disappointing. \n\nAll in all not really a big deal, unless this is a pattern of misinterpreting wishes/requests then I guess you've got a bigger issue on your hands.", "NTA but a skirt steak is a pretty crappy cut of meat", "NTA\n\nIf she can't communicate her issues with the meal like a grown-up then I wouldn't worry about it.

If he makes a habit of only half-delivering requests, it would make absolute sense that she'd start harboring resentment for it. \n\nI have had to sit my husband down and explain if he offers to help, but then diverts from the plan for whatever reason, he's not actually helping. He's only disappointing. And I shouldn't be asked to regularly be grateful for \"the effort\" because I would have been much happier to do it myself and actually get what I want.", "If you live with someone for 5 years you typically know what they like to eat though. I wouldn\u2019t think to specify how I want my steak because my husband knows I don\u2019t want a fusion steak unless that is specifically what I ask for.", "Ha! I'm a \"work in progress\"! Once my husband texted to tell me that he had gotten off work early and was making dinner for us. After an hour-long commute of anticipation, I walked in to find baked fish and boiled greens. I am not a picky eater but those are two things that I barely tolerate, and only because of the health benefits. I was beyond disappointed because he is a great cook and I really look forward to the times he prepares our dinner. To this day he jokes that he won't cook fish for me because fish makes me mad! In my opinion ESH. Sometimes intentions are noble and disappointment is real!", "You could also say childish lol", "Maybe she\u2019d had a bad day, and was looking forward to the meal she had requested? Maybe to her, requesting something but being given something different \u201cjust because\u201d is more about a lack of respect?\n\nI just don\u2019t think being disappointed is an AH move, nor is having to take the time to get over that disappointment. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I personally do get very emotional about my food. For this reason, I don't mess with anyone's food expectations.", "Except you can\u2019t be mad at her for being \u201cvague\u201d like all the comments say, when she was pretty straightforward (when you hear steak dinner with broccoli and asparagus, do you really think of a marinated chunk of beef? No, you don\u2019t. And she shouldn\u2019t have to specify cut like ribeye, ny strip, etc) and he admitted *he knew what she meant*\u2026 but then turn it around and say she should be grateful he still technically made what she wanted and kept it interesting. \n\nIt was not a lack of communication. It was a thing where OP decided to venture away from it (for reasons unknown. maybe he doesn\u2019t like straight up steak that much, maybe it was price, maybe it\u2019s because he really likes teriyaki, who knows) and hoping it\u2019d result in a positive reaction- which it didn\u2019t for unknown reasons (maybe she doesn\u2019t like tariyaki, or she was really craving a steak, maybe OP does this all the time where colors outside the lines and claims he still colored the picture which was the requirement, or she was looking forward to a steak dinner all day and had an idea of it and when she got home hungry after work it wasn\u2019t what she was thinking and was just disappointed.)\n\nA teriyaki marinated steak is not the same thing as having steaks for dinner. And it is okay for her to be disappointed that after expressing her wants, her boyfriend found a technicality to not provide what she wanted but able to say he did. \n\nI don\u2019t think OP is an asshole but I don\u2019t think she is one either. It\u2019s not a deep enough situation to warrant an asshole. It\u2019s okay to be disappointed with something your partner does. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to pretend to like something your partner does just because they took the time and resources to do it. And we don\u2019t know much of her reaction aside from saying she was \u201cdisappointed\u201d since OP didn\u2019t give specifics. Which is a fairly decent way to go about it to avoid future incidents that will set them both up for disappointing evenings.", "so if you say \"hey, i really want pancakes\" and i make you waffles, that's fine because i am trying something new for you?\n\njesus fucking christ.  they are in a half-decade long relationship and live together.  willfully disregarding clear communication is not being thoughtful.", ">He *considered that's what she meant. He did not know. \n\nHe literally said he was \"sure\" that's what she meant and decided to do something else anyway.\n\nThere's a terminal lack of communication in this relationship. OP could have texted back, \"How about Asian style marinade?\" OP's also not even sure how GF actually feels -- he says she *seems* mad. But instead of talking to her about it, he's asking us.", "Good lord, the hoops people are jumping through here to defend the op. I know full well if my daughter asks for steak, she expects the exact same steak we always have. Just like if my youngest asks for spaghetti, she's asking for the homemade sauce I make, not jarred Ragu. OP said he knew what she meant. It's fine to make something different, but it's also understandable that if you spent all day thinking about one meal, you might be a bit disappointed if you were served something pretty different. What op made is closer to filing a \"beef and broccoli\" craving than a steak craving. Honestly, a hamburger might have been closer to filling the craving than the skirt steak because of flavor profiles. \n\nIt's okay to be disappointed. It doesn't sound like the girlfriend actually said anything mean or hurtful. It's okay for op to change things up, but he's the one who failed to communicate. If I told my kids we're having steak or spaghetti or chili or whatever other dish that's always made a particular way, they expect it that particular way, not something different.", "Then he could have sent a follow up text. \n\nHow the fuck are you supposed to clarify steak? The default is two individual plain steaks. He had a feeling that\u2019s what she meant and chose to go an alternative without checking she\u2019d be okay with it. \n\nIf you\u2019re gonna call out poor communication, it was on both sides", "Different flavor, texture. Totally different tasting.", "I do understand that because of course OP would know what he usually makes. The difference is \"oh, we usually do this it this way BUT fuck her Ima do it this way instead to spite her!\"\n\nvs \"Oh, I've done this a few times already. Maybe I'll try something different this time that I also think she'd love to keep it fresh and new for her\"\n\nIt doesn't have to come from a bad place. Some people think that is the sign of a good cook and that it's a nice thing to do.", "It was pre-marinated, too! Less work than even just putting salt and pepper on yourself. Not exactly a huge outlay of personal effort.", "HAHAHAHA bro this sub has just become a place I can laugh at idiots (oh wait now I see the point of reddit) \n\nHad steak last night, the fucking Jacket potatoes took more work than the meat itself lol", "Right? This guy has either never been in a relationship, never understood the concept of doing something for someone to make them happy, or never cooked anything more complex than cereal. There is nothing more normal than occasionally suggesting dinner to your partner and them preparing it if they're home before you.", "It also does not compare to the better cuts of steak. It\u2019s fine for fancy nachos and fajitas, but it isn\u2019t a nice steak dinner", "This almost exactly happened with my husband and I last week.  I walked him to pick up a little cake or small cupcakes for a friend\u2019s birthday. It was only 4 of us so I didn\u2019t want a large cake or massive jumbo cupcakes. \n\nMy husband spent time searching and found mini cupcakes. When I saw them, I was like \u201cwhat the hell? Why is he cheaping out in his friend\u2019s birthday\u201d until I remembered I wrote \u201csmall cupcakes\u201d and he literally got what I asked for because I wasn\u2019t specific enough. \n\nIt made a nice story to explain to a full grown man why he was getting mini cupcakes on his birthday. We all had a good laugh.", "Yes! That's a good example! If my husband likes stout and I bring him some PBR, should he just be grateful?", "If my partner asks for fried chicken and I give them chicken nuggets covered in bbq sauce, I have still technically met their request, but that doesn't mean it isn't a shitty thing to do.\n\nYou know what, sometimes the half assed 'but at least they tried' isn't good enough.", "It\u2019s really dependent on the relationship though. If my wife asked for BBQ and noodles I know that she wants grilled breasts with sweet baby rays BBQ sauce and buttered egg noodles. If I make grilled thighs with Carolina BBQ sauce and spaghetti then that\u2019s not going to be what she wants even if it meets the technical definition of what she asked for. \n\nIt would also be kind of shitty, because I know what she wants and if I don\u2019t want that we should talk about it instead of me just doing whatever I want", "My partner makes homemade ramen from time to time and it\u2019s heaven. I once came home from snowshoeing with my mom and he had that going, I melted it was so awesome!", "Then you need to communicate much more clearly what your expectations and needs are. \n\nFYI folks, spouses do not have built in esp skills! This comes up regularly. \n\nIf you want a sirloin or cowboy steak or filet mignon, ask for it. A marinated flank steak is still steak - I took a steak-cooking class! I would have forgone the marinade and topped it with chimichurri instead (which TJ also sells). If you need the trash taken out Wednesday night, ask for it or put it on a chores calendar.\n\nI am sorry, but based on the post, OP is NTA.\n\nGF needs to cowboy up and communicate her needs better, or suck it up when she doesn't.", "Yip we always make ours with smoked sausage through it... if someone asks me to make it I make it this ways if I want to try something else in it I ask first.... offered it with bacon ones everyone said yes.... never again as they all prefer the sausage", "Exactly. I don't get why some peeps are saying just bc he cooked for her he isn't at any fault. If he wanted to try something new he could has asked her if she minded, that way she had a heads up, and if she ended up bot liking it then it would be on her. But to spring it on her and not expect her to be a little irked is a bit silly.", "this is really the issue.  it's not about whether a teriyaki skirt steak counts as steak.  it's about listening to your partner.", "Steak fajitas is not a steak dinner.  If you had steak fajitas, you would not ever say you had steak for dinner.\n\nI think people aren't realizing that OP stated that he knew what she was likely asking for, but he decided to venture away from that.  Almost an r/maliciouscompliance thing.\n\nA steak dinner is different than having beef for dinner.  I understand that steak is a cut, but for most people when they hear \"steak\" they specifically envision a traditional grilled slab of beef.\n\nThe GF clearly asked for what she wanted and he subverted a nuance of the English language.\n\nShe shouldn't have reacted the way she did.\n\nESH", "Yeah, but she was asked for suggestions. Not an order in a restaurant. It\u2019s not a demand. Just because she asks doesn\u2019t mean that he\u2019s obligated to make and pay for whatever her little heart desires. It\u2019s a springboard for ideas and unless he said yes, we are having steak dinner with drawn butter in response, it\u2019s her fault for expecting anything.", "Honestly, the biggest problem in this whole post is the lack of communication on both sides. Majorly.\n\nShe should have clearly said in the text what she wanted to eat, not just this vague what about X and then no other communication whatsoever. \n\nHe should have clarified with her like \"look what I found at the store, I'm gonna make it like this\", and she should use her words to say \" thank you for preparing dinner for us, I appreciate it. I do however prefer it more when it's made like this rather than this. We should have steak cooked this way tomorrow\"\n\nNo sulking about a dinner that's slightly not to your liking, that you didn't even cook, it was waiting nice and warm for you. This is childish.", "Yeah I don't like teriyaki.  Once in awhile I'll taste some I really enjoy but generally something about the taste makes me sick. I would've been so disappointed.", "That's the way it is in our house. Steak is a special occasion and hubby and I each have ways that we like our steak that are totally opposite (med-rare for me, well-done for him) so we ALWAYS go to a steakhouse to get it done and avoid this kind of angst.", "Steak is a type of meat. That's literally the only part in the definition of steak. So clarify the cut and how you want it cooked or the style.", "No I think you\u2019re thinking about flank. Skirt has more fat on it. It\u2019s one of my favourite cuts along side a hanger steak. I\u2019ve had a skirt steak at a steak house cooked over coal, and it was one of the best steaks in my life. Feel free to google recipes there\u2019s plenty out there.", "Switching it up is like hey, I know you like pepper sauce but I thought I'd do this red wine gravy too. Not making a completely different dish.", "That's something I do too. Usually when we have people over because it's not worth doing in small batches, so it's a whole stock pot. It's like 13 hours just cooking, so if someone does that for you, they love you. Or want an excuse because it's too much to do for just themselves", "But since when is throwing an idea out for dinner a demand? She *suggested* it. That doesn\u2019t magically obligate him to pay for and prepare whatever her little heart desires. And steak is expensive! He chose a cheaper cut that was less work which is his prerogative", "Exactly.\n\nSkirt steak is called steak, but OP knew it was a loophole. Exactly like you described, fajitas aren't a \"steak dinner\", no matter how much someone tries to claim bUT i UsED FlaNK sTEak. She asked for a steak dinner, not just beef.", "Why are people calling a Japanese dish a Mexican one? Feels like there is a racist dimension to the people who are pissed at the idea of having to eat \"brown\" people food.", "Skirt steak is, believe it or not, steak.", "Yeah when I saw \"skirt steak\" my reaction was who the hell asks for a steak dinner and expects fajita meat?!", "Cheese steaks include steak but are not a steak dinner.", "Asian marinated skirt steak is not what people consider a steak dinner.
