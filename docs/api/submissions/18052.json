Nice cut of skirt steak, around $25\n\nI begun cooking us a nice steak dinner so that it would be ready shortly after she got home and when she came home she was not pleased. I\u2019m a fairly good cook and cook for us often, and have made good steaks plenty of times.\n\nTo be fair, I\u2019m sure that she was expecting a couple of more traditional cuts of steak like a new york or filet or something. You know, more traditional steak preparation. Salt, pepper, butter kind of thing. I had considered this while shopping for the cut of steak but still met her criteria and was looking forward to making us a nice dinner. TJ\u2019s generally has great pre marinated meats and I thought it would be a fun switch up (and easier/quicker to prepare) while still being a good steak dinner! \n\nShe either didn\u2019t understand it was a different cut of steak and thought it was some cheap Asian beef dish, or didn\u2019t like the actual final result (I enjoyed it) but regardless she was not pleased. If she didn\u2019t enjoy the Trader Joe\u2019s marinated steak I\u2019m totally fine with that, no skin off my back, but she seemed to be disappointed and mad with me which is what bothered me when we could have enjoyed a nice steak dinner (not \u201csteak dinner\u201d according to her) even if it\u2019s not what she had in mind\n\nTl;dr made skirt steak in Asian marinade when my girlfriend requested a steak dinner, she evidently had a different steak preparation in mind and was not pleased \n\nAm I the asshole here?

While I do agree with everyone that you cooking a nice steak dinner was a really awesome thing to do, you did also say that you knew this wasn't what she meant when she said a steak dinner. So I say you were a bit of an ah for being disingenuous about the expectations of a steak dinner and using the vagueness of the text as a way to technically do what was asked even if it wasn't how it was intended. Again you still made dinner which was awesome but I can see how your gf was disappointed especially if she knows you knew what she meant.", "Sounds like you know the answer and are trying to \u201cskirt\u201d by on technicalities. See what I did there. \n\nYou say you knew what she meant by wanting steak, and you decided not to do it. A steak dinner and a steak stir fry are very different. You could have texted her? \n\nWhether or not she overreacted is a different issue, but you\u2019re being squirrelly with your language and trying to convince us you\u2019re right even though you know what she wanted, so I\u2019m going to say YTA.", "Info: what did she actually say. I read a lot of assumptions on your part, see seemed disappointed and mad? Has she expressed that she prefers a certain cut in the past?", "NTA.  It\u2019s easy to see why you interpreted her text the way you did.  It was generally worded\u2026nothing specific in what kind of meat she wanted or how it was to be made.  The fact that she was mad after all the preparation and cooking you did just screams entitlement.   She should\u2019ve been happy at all the work you did.  I don\u2019t get it.", "I\u2019m going with NTA but it also is weird to me that your wording includes so many phrases speculating about how she \u201cseemed\u201d to feel, etc. Did you ask her how she felt, and explain your reasoning? It seems like if you just had an open conversation about this, it probably doesn\u2019t need to be a big deal. If she really wants to be treated with a more traditional steak dinner then surely you can just do that next time, and no harm done?", "Hmm.  I think that if I were looking forward to a tasty medium-rare steak, with chunky potato chips, mushrooms, and a green vegetable, and perhaps even a fancy sauce on the side, I'd be disappointed with a meal that wasn't exactly that, however delicious.  If you have a yen for something particular to eat, a substitute doesn't satisfy it.\n\nYou knew what she was actually asking for, didn't you?  Nobody seriously interprets \"a steak dinner\" as \"anything made with steak\".  I mean, sure, the dinner sounds really good, but it was not what she had asked for, was it?  You know this.\n\nYTA", "I was toying with N A H, but I am going to go slightly with YTA here.\n\nI was initially looking at it as a miscommunication, in which no one is at fault, that she said Steak and that clearly meant something different to her and you. The reason I have gone with YTA in the end is because you have said that while looking for the steak, that you clearly considered whether what you were looking at met her expectations and at the end of the day you knew it didn't really and what she meant, and went for it anyway because technically it is still Steak.\n\nI don't like Steak personally, but if I did and had built that in my head as my nice dinner at the end of the day (in the more expected, sirloin, bit of seasoning and not much else), I'd probably be a bit disappointed too if that wasn't what I got, even if the actual meal had been lovely.\n\nThere isn't anything wrong with trying something new or switching it up, but either ask or at least give her a heads up next time.", "NTA though I can see her disappointment if she was expecting no marinade and a different cut of steak maybe with a seasoning rub. But she should specify if her craving is that specific. \n\nI'd just be happy that someone was cooking for me :-)", "I might be looking way too into this, but I feel not only are you TA, but you\u2019re also gaslighting your girlfriend by getting the opinions of strangers to make your case for you:\n\nThis title is misleading. It should read: \u201cAITA for deliberately ignoring my girlfriends dinner request?\u201d\n\nCooking for someone else is an incredibly nice thing to do for someone so on the surface, people want to say NTA, however, there are a few times where you outright admit your fault\u2026\n\n\u201cTo be fair, I\u2019m sure she was expecting\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI had considered this while shopping\u2026\u201d\n\nSo you knew what she wanted and went the other way. Great job", "INFO: what do you mean by she \u201cseemed to be disappointed and mad\u201d? Did she do something here? Of course you\u2019re not TA, but I don\u2019t actually see what she did wrong either. She\u2019s allowed to be disappointed, but did she treat you poorly? Did she take it out on you? What exactly did she do?", "NAH - she gave you ingredients, you combined them into a meal.  She did probably assume that you were going to make like a strip or ribeye or something along those lines.  I won't lie, if someone  said to me make steak for dinner or come over were having steaks a skirt steak would probably be the last cut I'd think of.", "Has she had sesame teriyaki marinated steaks previously?", "YTA\n\nNot for not cooking what she wanted, but you\u2019ve been together for around 5 years. You either know damn well what type of meal she was craving from her \u201csteak dinner\u201d text and you\u2019re just playing dumb because you felt like something else OR you didn\u2019t know and didn\u2019t bother checking/asking for clarification, still knowing damn well you two might not be on the same page. \n\nYTA not for the food itself, but for being with someone for 5 years and not knowing how to properly communicate with your partner, then coming on Reddit and trying to do \u201cwell but AcTuALLy its TeChNiCaLLy steak\u201d bit to shred off responsibility. You didn\u2019t even have to cook the damn dinner she wanted, didn\u2019t even have to leave the house to shop and do all that!

Instead of asking her to clarify if you were really unsure, you used the vagueness of her text as an excuse to make a faster dinner that was more to your taste when it\u2019s her birthday request", "NTA.   \nDinner sounded delucious.\n\nThat was pretty rude of her.", "Soft YTA because you seemed to have known what she meant and went another direction on purpose. What you made sounds great, but I think you knew beforehand that what you made wasn\u2019t what she meant.", ">To be fair, I\u2019m sure that she was expecting a couple of more traditional cuts of steak like a new york or filet or something.\n\nSo, you knew what she was expecting, and yet you decided against what you knew she wanted? That's not a misinterpretation. That's a conscious choice to ignore your partners wishes and preferences, and that makes YTA.\n\nShe's right. A cheap cut of meat smothered in an overpowering sauce is not a \"nice steak dinner.\" I'm not surprised that she's disappointed. Are there other examples of when you disappointed her because you figured \"technically it's close enough to what I know she wanted\"?", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut\u2026I\u2019ve been your wife before. My guess is she had a shit day, was hungry and was craving a delicious steak you\u2019ve made in the past. And probably fair for her to expect that if that is how you have consistently made in the past. Then we she got home she was all excited about the one thing she has been looking forward to for hours only to find a subpar version of it and she just feels like this is one more thing that didn\u2019t work out for her today. She is clearly wrong, she Knows she is wrong, but she is disappointed. That being said, if that steak was prepared in something you know she does not like (like excessively spicy seasoning, for example) and you bought it anyway knowing this, then YTA because you know her and should know better than that.", "Gunna go with NTA \n\nHer behavior was ungrateful and rude. She could have easily said, \"You know, I didn't love that marinated steak. Let's do something else next time.\" Totally out of line for her to actually get mad about this. \n\nBut if you knew what she meant by a \"steak dinner\" why did you go off script? If you'd checked with her beforehand, this entire situation would have been avoided. I don't think this makes you an asshole. You just didn't think things through.", "Yta. You knew it wasn't what she wanted you just didn't care.", "NTA\n\nJust wanted to add that skirt steak is my favourite cut and I\u2019d be very happy if my partner made that for me. \n\n1. You were so thoughtful to cook everything in time for her to get home \u2764\ufe0f\n2. Skirt is a delicious cut of steak, teriyaki marinade is yummy. \n3. It\u2019s really not that big of a deal and the fact she is having a whinge is kinda hilarious. If she was craving something very specific then she should of; communicated exactly what she wanted or organised it herself. \n\nThere\u2019s always tomorrow if it didn\u2019t hit the spot and it\u2019s only steak.", "YTA, who thinks Asian marinade when as asking for a steak?? You also knew what she meant and still got the Asian marinade. You also could have easily texted her and asked hey this is a new marinade, would you like it? Most people only put butter, salt, and pepper on their steaks or have a pretty western marinade. Asian flavors are super distinct.", "I'll be honest...If you were a woman saying this about your male partner, I'd assume he was an entitled little prick. But because the genders are reversed, I'm going to assume she's an entitled little prick.\n\nThere's no standard, universally accepted definition of 'steak dinner'. She got steak, broccoli and asparagus - what she asked for with the exception of the marinade, which she didn't specifically say she wanted/didn't want.\n\nGod forbid it was some 'cheap Asian beef dish'. Didn't realise steak dinners were a flex but regardless, this is stupid. You're NTA.", "NTA and wtf is wrong with commenters? You cooked a nice meal and she's pissy because it not exactly the way she imagined it?\n\nYou cooked, it was edible, any other reaction then \"Thanks Honey\" is selfish and entitled.", "NTA - The YTA comments on this post are a little strange to me. One miscommunication about a steak dinner does not make you an asshole. Yes, maybe you could have cleared things up with her about what she wanted... but she could have done the same. \n\nThis is a very minor thing and if she's making a big deal about it then I think that's a little unfair after you went through a lot of effort to prepare her a nice meal. I'm sure this issue can easily be solved with a quick conversation about being more specific when requesting meals in future. It's not that deep.\n\nSide note: It's only an easy conversation if you approach it in the right way. Just acknowledge that she was disappointed and figure out what the solution is to prevent this from happening in the future.", "You did groceries and cooked a meal, ready for when she got him.\n\nWhat's not to like?\n\nNTA", "**NTA** \n\nYou bought and cooked dinner!", "NAH.

Probably closer to NAH.\n\nI will say that in my country the pre-marinated steak at the store is probably the worst meat you can buy in the store. It's always the worst cut of meat that they are trying to hide behind the marinade, but it's also marinated so long that it completely messes with the texture of the meat. Shit is so nasty. Not sure about the texture/quality where you live. \n\nIf I was asked specifically what I wanted for dinner, and then didn't get that but some other variation, I'd probably be slightly annoyed too. I think we all know the feeling of being excited for a particular meal, especially after a long day, and then when it's not what you hoped for it can be disappointing. \n\nAll in all not really a big deal, unless this is a pattern of misinterpreting wishes/requests then I guess you've got a bigger issue on your hands.", "NTA but a skirt steak is a pretty crappy cut of meat", "NTA\n\nIf she can't communicate her issues with the meal like a grown-up then I wouldn't worry about it.

That's a direct ask.", "Why does she have to waste her youth her energy and her emotions on him?\n\nYou're right he can get what he wants as a single person if he continues to behave this way. \n\nWhen your partner tells you they want something and you clearly understand what it is they want and you go out of your way to not give them what they want but in a way that makes them look bad for being upset about it you're probably not emotionally mature enough to be in a relationship in the first place.", "No I would not care.\n\nMy partner went through the attempt, that is more important than the result in this case. It is just a bad meal. Absolutely no reason to be mad.", "In a parallel universe OPs Mrs absolutely loved it and is chuffed he introduced her to another cut of steak prepared a different way.\n\nHe met the brief and put the extra thought in to try something new. He was coming from a good place.\n\nYou're allowed to have the thought that it wasn't what you wanted. You still should appreciate the thought behind it and be happy he cooked for you.\n\nNothing wrong with mentioning that you prefer the usual way if you frame it from a grateful place.", ">When I think I'm going to get a meal I'll be able to eat and enjoy and am instead served something I don't even like, I would not be pleased.\n\nIf you're a picky eater, that's *your* problem, not everyone else's. You get to inform people about any specific food restrictions (allergies, specific diets, perhaps restrictions on spicy), but you don't get to place an order when other people cook for you. If you want something cooked to your exact specifications, go to a restaurant or cook it yourself.", "I agree with you. While both are fine meals, a marinated skirt steak is VERY different than a grilled porterhouse.", "That's mild difference at best, and the tantrum over it puts anyone in the wrong.", "I marinate steaks all the time and every steak house I\u2019ve ever been to serves steaks sliced. If my partner cooked me steak I wouldn\u2019t berate them. That\u2019s a great way to never have them cook for you again.", "Good for you; that's you and your relationship. Not everyone feels the same way, and that's okay! I prefer communicating with my partner, and other couples can have that preference too.", "And its not a sacrifice for her to eat the steak he wanted. That he paid for. That he cooked. You know, a free steak. Seriously... why are we arguing about who's the asshole in being upset about getting a free steak.", "Saying \"what if\" is a manipulative phrase to get what you want. It's a polite demand first off. \n\nYes, it would have been even nicer for him to go out of his way and make exactly what he thought she wanted. May have hit the mark getting a ribeye in butter, might not. Maybe she would've preferred a t-bone. But it's not necessary. \n\nAnd again. Why is SHE more important than him? She seems less emotionally mature than him for getting so upset. You're saying that he needs to sacrifice his preferences for her over an unplanned last minute dinner. Why? Why does HE have to? Why is it only a waste of her energy and youth? When he can't \"win\" with her. Either he gives in and not do anything he wants, simple as getting a different cut/marinade as meat to fit her ask and his preferences.", "The one who goes out of their way to prep a nice meal is the entitled one?\n\nSure, okay.", "I guess what I'm hung up on is that OP seemed to know what she wanted but got something else because it technically met the definition. He also could have just said \"is this type of steak alright with you\" if he wasn't sure, which it seems he wasn't because he mentioned contemplating it in the store", "So that\u2019s what she should of communicated if she felt like something very specific. As someone who craves specific dinners, when my partner cooks and does the shopping I will be very clear with what I\u2019d like him to get, otherwise I know he will buy something from his interpretation or if something is on special.. or whatever, it doesn\u2019t matter. In a relationship you compromise. If you want something done a specific way, you need to spell it out. People are not robots, they\u2019re allowed to make changes and be creative. Get over it already.", "Who threw a tantrum?", "No, it\u2019s not a \u201cmild difference.\u201d  It\u2019s 2 completely different meals. That\u2019s like saying lasagna and garlic bread is the same meal as pizza with meatballs on top. The INGREDIENTS are the same, but that\u2019s it.", ">every steak house I\u2019ve ever been to serves steaks sliced\n\nWut. Literally never seen this in my life. What major steakhouse does this?", "I have never ordered a steak at a steakhouse and have it come to the table pre-sliced. The only slicing that they do is when someone wants a thick steak well-done and the steak is butterflied. If your steak comes pre-sliced, it's probably very poor quality beef.", "Who said he was berated? He didn't. And you've been served asain skirt steak that wasn't sliced? That's interesting. Even on the trader Joe's website where it lists this same dish, it is sliced over rice.", "He bought the ingredients he wanted. He confirmed that she didn't mean she wanted a sesame teriyaki marinated steak", "\u201cWhat if\u2026\u201d is a suggestion. Manipulative my arse. OP was free to say that no, he didn\u2019t fancy that.", "Passive aggressiveness is not the answer to a situation like this where your preference clashes with your partners. \n\nShe requested something He told her he complied with her request so her expectation was a certain thing. When she came home she found out that in fact he had manipulated her because he maliciously complied with her request by technically giving her steak but not anywhere near the meal she was expecting."]}
