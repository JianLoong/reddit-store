May has DID, dissociative identity disorder. For those that don\u2019t know, it\u2019s a personality disorder caused by trauma that makes a person have more than one individual personality. Some can be based on fictional characters in media or even real people apparently. I don't know what trauma May had, but I noticed she started to copy certain things I did regularly after we spoke more. I asked one of my friends and they put it as her \"using me for an alter\" or something like that.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing. Originally it wasn\u2019t a big deal or any issue to me whatsoever. It was just small stuff at the start like the same nickname, similar food choices, and clothing style. Things I didn\u2019t care about. But then she started going further. This included randomly messaging my other friends online who didn\u2019t know her and claiming to be me, trying to make flirty jokes with my girlfriend which made her uncomfortable, mimicking my accent (she\u2019s white and I\u2019m latino), and even going on to give her \"alter\" the same backstory as me. For context, I lost my younger sister to a disease years back and May decided to add that to the alter for some reason.\n\nI tried to be polite about it but she would keep making excuses and ignoring my boundaries. The sister part was the final straw, so I told May I wasn\u2019t comfortable being around her or taking to her anymore because of how much she had dissolved into this. I told her she was becoming borderline obsessed and should seek professional help if she couldn\u2019t control it and then I blocked her everywhere. I even privated my main socials so that she couldn't spy on me through a lurker account.\n\nI\u2019m guessing she messaged our other friends with her own side because I started getting messages. Most were supportive since they knew how far she was going, but others have called me ableist for how I treated the situation instead of being supportive of her.

Watch your credit score....", "My understanding is that folks with DID don't try to take over the lives of the other person that they have just been interacting with. So their diagnosis sound suspicious. They also don't remember what the alter did, so if you are talking to them as May and they know about the altar having various conversations or believing certain things that also doesn't line up.\n\nBlock her, move on. Sounds like you only know them online so should be easy enough.", "NTA.  It isn't ableist to be uncomfortable having your identity basically stolen.", "NTA and I highly doubt she has DID. I\u2019m a therapist and I don\u2019t know a single psychologist, counselor, or social worker who has come across a real case of it in their entire careers, it\u2019s that rare. Actually, I think I can recall one counselor who had 1 case. She never knew which alter was going to show up in the office that day. \n\nPeople who do have it describe as being a passenger in their own body and that they\u2019re not driving. It\u2019s an extreme form of dissociation and 99% of cases have had *horrific* childhood trauma. And I do mean horrific. \n\nThey also have terrible memories because they disassociate so often, so it\u2019s super suspicious that she had the wherewithal to message your friend group to give her side of the story. Alters are also created subconsciously and people with DID don\u2019t have much control over which one shows up when. \n\nIt really is a terrible, exhausting disorder developed only by those who have been the victims of the worst of humanity. I can\u2019t stand when people fake it for attention.", "NTA.\n\nEven if May DOES legitimately have DID (which is an exceedingly rare diagnosis and often faked online), you have the right to maintain your boundaries.", "NTA. \n\nIt's become a trend in some areas of Discord and TT to fake/take on an exaggerated version of DID.

DID isn't the kind of shit you hide from someone you basically spend all your time with.\n\nVulnerable, susceptible people go to these internet echo chambers that act like a cult. They encourage each other and establish a really isolating us vs them mentality. Anything that calls for accountability is \"ableist\". I got accused of being ableist because I didn't like that she kept trying to convince ME I had DID. It ruined our relationship and any chance of friendship beyond it. You're absolutely not the asshole here. I think you did what's best to protect yourself from how toxic this could have been.", "Ok, first what she's doing isn't not because of DID. By definition, you dissociate from self, and they say an alter comes in to handle a situation that the host self can not. The host self has no idea this is going on. The host doesn't pick and choose alters or create them. This chick has something else going on.", "NTA.  I hope she gets the help she needs.", "NTA. Also, Alters develop from a trauma, as a coping mechanism to deal with whatever they\u2019ve experienced\u2026 Folks don\u2019t just choose an alter out of nowhere\u2026 so this makes me wonder if one of her alters is doing this for a certain reason.

This whole friend group is toxic.", "DID is a dissociative disorder caused by severe childhood trauma, not a personality disorder,  and alters are not consciously created. This person doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s diagnosed or in treatment and is just using a label that doesn\u2019t apply to her as an excuse to not take responsibility for her actions. People with DID are still responsible for any harm they cause even if it\u2019s the actions of only one alter. People who do what she is doing, give people who actually have DID a bad name.

It\u2019s true that it is a rare disorder, and that a lot of people online think it\u2019s \u201ctrendy\u201d due to how it\u2019s been portrayed and mythologized in media. \nIn real life, DID is pretty debilitating. Most people experience severe amnesia, really poor short-term memory, and symptoms related to post-traumatic stress. A lot of people with DID also end up spending time institutionalized (I\u2019ve done three stints). It\u2019s not very glamorous, and most folks who actually have DID will go very, very, very far out of their way to make sure you never know about it. I can count on one hand the number of people in my life who know about my diagnosis (other than my therapists, lol) because the stigma can greatly affect your life.\n\nAlters don\u2019t usually form gradually, the way you describe this person\u2019s transition toward being more \u201cyou\u201d. To me it sounds more like this person slowly started adopting and absorbing mannerisms, then found a reason to justify it that fitted their worldview. Also, even if we give this person the benefit of the doubt and assume they\u2019re being fully honest, they still crossed a lot of boundaries. She owes you an apology for that and should take responsibility for it; DID is a diagnosis, not a get out of jail free card. She is responsible for her own actions, no matter which alter was in \u201ccontrol\u201d. \n\nAll this to say, this person sounds more like they\u2019ve developed an obsession than an alter. I\u2019d steer clear of them, and take their self-diagnosis with a grain of salt.", "I\u2019m sorry but that\u2019s literally not how DID works.

That's a lot to have to cope with, and I wonder if those detractors would like it happening to them. I'd be very uncomfortable with it.

You were supportive, but it got too much. That's perfectly fair, in my opinion.", "NTA. That's not how DID works.", "NTA.\nYou have every right to be uncomfortable. Just because someone has a disability they cant control doesnt mean they are absolved of all responsibility. They should at least attempt to respect your very real concerns, especially if their alter is aware that they are, in fact, a member of a DID system. They might not be in control of their disorder choosing to model an alter after you and your life, but they are still responsible for their healing journey and for learning coping mechanisms that will respect those around them. They HAVE to acknowledge they cannot just take over your life like that.\n\nYou did the right thing. You are protecting yourself and enforcing your boundaries. You have valid concerns.

What is rare is the overt form of DID, where there are obvious switches, and obviously different alters. The vast majority of people with DID are very good at hiding it and they may not even know themselves that they have it.\n\nAlso, DID is caused by chronic early childhood trauma--whatever the child perceived as overwhelmingly traumatic at the time. It does not have to be *objectively* \"horrific\" by any means. Mental health professionals who have \"never seen a case\" haven't seen it because it's not on their radar as a possibility and because they don't know the questions to ask that can screen for its presence.\n\n*But regardless of the facts about DID,* you don't have to let anyone treat you in a way that makes you uncomfortable or disregards your boundaries.

You need to learn more about what is going on before deciding that she *has an* alter of you on purpose.  \n\n\nIn her case, she needs to help this alter come to terms with the fact they *aren't* you, and do not have your life.

One stemmed from sexual assault as a young adult and the other (someone I met socially and not as a patient) was from childhood covert abuse as well as transphobic violence. Considering how common these types of trauma are, I wouldn't be surprised if many more people have DID or similar tendencies than originally estimated.", "I have dissociation from childhood (and early adulthood) trauma so severely I have episodes where my dissociation freezes me up so much doctors on an acute medical ward weren\u2019t sure if I was having a stroke or pulmonary embolism. I cannot move at all, can\u2019t speak and have dread like a near death experience. I do \u2018separate\u2019 off into coming back into a slightly different version of myself because like many very traumatised kids I kind of codeswitched trauma responses:\n\nSo fawn to a crazy extent with some people to feel safe, fight like a feral cat with others. Freeze to be invisible to others. I have a fawn persona a bit like a telephone voice, my fighty side has a nickname and my frozen side is different again. I have difficulty recalling what went on during dissociation and it is exhausting. I feel like my brain physically hurts, I am tensed up to the extent it aches, the memories are not linear (but I have some. This is a key sign of trauma responses) so I might recall heavily the music playing but zero recollection of the person themselves.\n\nDissociation is not conscious for me. I hate it. I can\u2019t follow stuff like \u2018did I leave the oven on?\u2019 and I feel like shit physically and mentally afterwards. It\u2019s particularly worse the more it happens. When younger I numbed it with eating disorders, drugs, booze, sex. Now I try to sit with each wave and it leaves me physically ill like a huge hangover. It\u2019s jumbled blank mess where even those who know me best are continually surprised what I remember and don\u2019t. They joke \u2018was that your other GF?\u2019 because I\u2019m unnerving when this happens and it helps them cope as often they don\u2019t realise except \u2018oooh she got very tense\u2026oh dissociating\u2026\u2019\n\nI find it very hard to articulate even to therapists partly because dissociation tends to have wee friends of derealization and depersonalization where you are \u2018is this real? God am I real?\u2019 It\u2019s like being blackout drunk for me but like in the blackout going \u2018hmmm, is this a black out?\u2019\n\nI do not have DID and none of the many therapists and pyschs I\u2019ve met have encountered it. They do report that most people who have dissociated since childhood more likely fail to recognise they are as it is a malignant form of daydreaming and then maladaptive day dreaming or playing where you have saved yourself from trauma by creating a bubble. Most people are enormously freaked out to discover other people do not think and act like that so \u2018automatically\u2019 and are not glib about it. They are scared to stop, deeply shaken to discover how traumatised they are and rarely talk about it for fear of being disbelived as a key trauma symptom is minimising your own trauma and self gaslighting. You get the newly diagnosed cope where everything is \u2018my dissociation\u2019 but that happens with a lot of stuff like later ADHD dx and recovery and calms down.\n\nIf it continues to be sole personality trait, then in my experience it may be a mental health issue but usually not the one they admit to. But more often it\u2019s faking and manipulation especially if you can film and narrate it on tik tok. And ironically this is why I never talk about it IRL. People don\u2019t believe unless you do \u2018the movie version.\u2019\n\nSorry folks but it\u2019s mainly arguing with people and wondering why the fuck I am on this bus or why I cannot remember any of the previous three series of Sex Education despite loving it (watched them all in lockdown when unrelated to pandemic was very ill and having those paralysis level dissociative episodes\u2026)\n\nNTA.

According to a lot of users here, it\u2019s not something most people with DID are that open about due to the symptoms", "That\u2019s what I tried to do before I blocked her. I told her I was becoming concerned and that it wasn\u2019t healthy if she couldn\u2019t differentiate me from the alter. I didn\u2019t have any problems when it was just the small stuff, but it started to feel like she was intentionally going out of her to look for personal information on me just to add to it. There was so much that she managed to find that I had only told a handful of people or posted in private", "Rest assured that there is no way this girl actually has DID.", "Yes, she is doing it because she wants it. She's very obviously faking it because it's the new shiny trendy thing to have.

Source - work in mental health with individuals diagnosed with DID", "DID exists but what these people are claiming to have is not DID in the factual sense. \n\nThere were lots of other inconsistencies and contradictions with her claims but I don't really want to think about her right now. \ud83d\ude02", "NTA\n\nI won't say never because that's how you get bitten in the butt, however after studying DID psychiatric studies, papers and articles to better understand a friend who claims it, I think it would be very, very unlikely that your friend could \"build\" an alter. (I'm 99.9 percent sure they can't.) Alters are created as a survival strategy, and the subconscious brain decides their purpose and how best to fulfill it. \n\nThis is another, very little known disorder called Maladaptive Daydreaming that may be closer to what this person is presenting, particularly since you mentioned fictional characters and real people. A person becomes immersed in fantasies about these characters or people and may take on their characteristics  as a way of escape, but they don't actually become those alters. Many times, though, those with Maladaptive Daydreaming confuse it with having alters. It's often connected with ADHD, therefore there could be some ADHD memory problems that mimic the amnesia from switching between alters. \n\nEither way, it would be discomfiting to be the basis of one of these characters, regardless of how they manifest. These types of personality disorders are really hard to navigate day to day, and there's no shame in taking care of yourself by limiting or cutting off ties if you find it overwhelming.", "Don\u2019t worry about it, it\u2019s a common misconception and sometimes confused due to the old diagnostic term for the disorder (multiple personality disorder). There\u2019s also a lot of misinformation spread online by people who are not professionals and people who imitate false representations of the disorder for attention, which causes confusion for people who are trying to learn about it. It\u2019s a highly misunderstood disorder and in recent years has been frequently romanticized online and treated as a trendy disorder to have by people who think it will make them quirky or special (which it doesn\u2019t). The categorization of mental illness isn\u2019t really common knowledge either. Just know you\u2019re not in the wrong for reducing contact. She needs professional help because what she\u2019s doing isn\u2019t okay.", "Your friend doen't have it and that's not how it presents.\n\n*Edit*spelling", "I have a friend that is professionally diagnosed that is in a support group for people that are professionally diagnosed (you have to be referred to the group and they have a process before you are let in)\n\nMy friend is very open about it. He thinks his diagnosis is interesting and will gladly chat about it. He also openly tells people when he meets them\u2026.in the same way someone might say \u201chey just fyi I have diabetes\u201d \n\nThere are others in the group that feel the same, and there are some that only tell people as they get close to them and some that plan to always hide their diagnosis. It very much just depends on the person.\n\n\n\n\nI don\u2019t know. Obviously I can\u2019t diagnose for many reasons. For me it doesn\u2019t sound like my personal experience with my friend and it doesn\u2019t sound like what I have read online. Personally I think she\u2019s faking which makes you NTA\u2026..also the fact that you haven\u2019t met IRL and this was just an online chat thing, IMO it very much sounds like attention seeking and probably does have SOME SORT of diagnosis (bpd, depression,something) that is causing her to do this\u2026.I just don\u2019t think it is DID", "I 100% agree with you, there. It seems like a case you're not even uncomfortable with the fact she has this alter, but her behavior surrounding it, which is a real asshole move on her part. That's pretty creepy of them, I will admit.   \n\n\nYou're not in the wrong to block her at all for continued behavior that makes you uncomfortable and crosses multiple boundaries, especially if you tried to reach out about it, at all.   \n\n\nJust be careful of the wording you use because while most people with DID are not like this, because they're very quiet about it and deal with it themselves, there are people with any disorder that feel the world revolves around them, and will use their disorder as an excuse they should be able to do anything. Folks who follow that echo chamber will latch onto any preconceived bias or misunderstanding on your part.", "Can't rest assured when people think they get to decide who does and doesn't have a disorder based entirely on if they're a freak about it. It doesn't matter if she really does or doesn't because people both with or without it could behave this way for multiple reasons. Sometimes they're an attention seeker, sometimes they're an asshole, sometimes they're struggling.   \n\n\nDID is so controversial and misunderstood even among people that do have it that a lot of people will get shamed for displaying symptoms or behavior that is completely and utterly normal for that disorder just because it isn't stereotypical. Even in their own community.  \n\n\nMaybe don't base how you see disordered people on how realistic it is to *you*, unless you have proof of them faking being the case. I ignored the other comments because that sort of thing is dealt with enough, but with you replying to me I'm going to make that stance clear.", "Oh, I didn't realize you know her in real life and know her medical information as well as all her inner thoughts. Must be really nice to know better than someone about their own condition.", "How does it usually present? Like I\u2019m genuinely asking so I can have a better understanding", "DID is so rare that doctors regularly argue about whether it's real or not. There's no way all those teenagers and young adults on TikTok really have the disorder, and I highly highly doubt OP's friend does as well. It's just another trendy thing these kids are going through and going to be embarrassed about once they've grown up. What's unhealthy and \"ablest\" is going along with their need to be special and unique by pretending to have a disorder you can only get by being so traumatized that your brain splits itself in half.", "Google it and look at some medical websites not people off tiktok or TV shows.", "I have tried to gain a better understanding with research on websites, but the main thing is that this is the only person I\u2019ve met so far who claimed to have it so I don\u2019t have a proper way of knowing how to compare when it\u2019s legit or when it\u2019s possibly not. After all, I\u2019m not a psychiatrist or someone who could give a professional diagnosis myself.", "Yeah and they're making it up. Which is why it doesn't match the diagnosis. Either they made it up or you made them up.", "For one, \"fictives\" aren't real, so if she claims to have any alters that are fictional characters from her favorite series, that's a faker right then and there. \n\nAlso, you don't just add another alter whenever the mood strikes you. It's something your brain does to protect itself from something so traumatic that you can't process it healthily. They aren't going to get an alter of you just like that for no reason other than \"oh it's just something my brain does lolol\".", "Fictives are very much real and a fairly common form of alter. my DID specialist \\[been diagnosed since 18\\] has confirmed this."]}
