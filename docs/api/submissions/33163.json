They are chaotic, busy little people with big feelings. I try to find the balance between firm, consistent parenting and also making my own life easier. One way I\u2019ve found of doing this is to park in the emptiest part of the parking lot. 1F hates getting buckled into her car seat, so it allows me to stand there wrestling her with the door open without feeling bad about taking up spaces. 4M likes to climb up and buckle himself in but he can\u2019t reach the door to pull it closed after he\u2019s in so we\u2019re often left with both doors open for a wee while. \n\nLast week Friday, we went to the grocery store. Found a completely empty row at the back of the parking lot, went and did the groceries with the kids, got back to the car - our row still had 4-5 empty parking spaces to the right side of our car, and one to the left with a few cars parked beyond that. Great, means I don\u2019t have to rush. \n\nSo while I\u2019m starting to buckle in a writhing, wailing, one year old, four year old opens his door to climb in on the side with just one empty space. A woman pulls up and indicates into the space. I smile and point to the empty spaces on the other side of my car in case she didn\u2019t see them. She frowns and points into the space my four year old\u2019s door is occupying. I gesture to my screaming baby and hold my hands up to say sorry. She rolls her eyes, I go back to buckling the baby, and she BEEPS HER HORN. \n\nMy four year old gets a huge fright and starts crying. The baby\u2019s screaming intensifies. I\u2019m sweating. I grab the baby back out so I can go around and shut the four year old\u2019s door, she barely waits until I\u2019m clear to whip into the space. On my way back around my car I take out my phone and take a picture of our car with all the empty spaces next to it so I can text my wife and get sympathy. This woman busts out of her car and says \u201cwhat did you just take a picture of?\u201d. I\u2019m extremely irritated at this point, and I reply \u201call the spaces you could have used instead of making my life harder.\u201d She looks offended and tells me to delete it! I just laugh at her and tell her that her car isn\u2019t in my picture and that she can\u2019t tell me to delete a picture of empty parking spaces. She tells me again to delete it. I lose my mind and say \u201cbut then how will I demonstrate what an asshole you were when I\u2019m telling this story later?\u201d\n\nShe stormed off into the supermarket, I wrangle the baby into the car and head home. Later that night I\u2019m telling my wife and she told me I should have deleted the picture!

You didn't take a pic of the woman's car, so it wasn't any of her business what you did with the picture. \n\nThen again, on my phone, when you \"delete\" a pic it goes into the trash where it stays for 30 days and then gets automatically deleted.
