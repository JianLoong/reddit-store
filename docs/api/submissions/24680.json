Pay her cost from ten years ago if you care too and move on. But she doesn\u2019t need five hundred.", "She probably wants a PS5 and is just scamming you lol", "Really? Is this PSP or are you confusing it with another gaming console?", "I commented on your post. But go to dkoldies.com they have a tiktok and instagram. They sell vintage console and games.", "She probably wants a PS5 and is just scamming you lol", "Exactly, OP should tell her to sod off. Give her $50, she can get one off ebay lol.", "No way a PSP cost $1000. Your sister is trying to con you. Check yourself from the dealers or websites.", "I'm stumped still with how the oil got into it.  Was the oil in a bottle / container?  Did she show you at the time?\n\nIt all sounds too dodgy.  She should have asked for a replacement way back then.  It kind of sounds like she's reminiscing and wants you to pay for it.", "This all seems very fishy. How the hell would coconut oil \u201emelt\u201c? How would it get into the PSP and ruin it?\n\nHonestly, I wouldn\u2019t give a dime for that.", "Was the oil in a closed container?  Did you set it on TOP of her PS, or next to it?  I'm having difficulty figuring out how the oil managed to seep into her device, instead of forming a puddle near/under it, which wouldn't destroy it.  If she can't explain how it happened, I'm wondering if there's more going on.\n\nIf her answer makes sense, figure out how much her PS would have cost at the time.  PSs are like iPhones -- some models were pricier than others at their release.  If you can't find this info easily online, find a friend who's a gamer and will tell you.", "I'm one hundred percent sure I did not see it, my sister told me the PSP was on a shelf where I put it, but I didn't notice or think twice about putting it there at all.", "I think the person replying is trying to make the point that as this incident occurred whilst the sister and OP were children and most likely below the age of responsibility, the mother should have taken the replacement of the PSP up with her home insurance. \n\nThe person replying is highlighting that as the mother didn\u2019t rectify the issue at the time it occurred, the mother didn\u2019t believe herself, that the accident warranted rectifying. \n\nThe person replying is pointing out the mother\u2019s hypocrisy.", "Yeah, but I think there is a bit of a difference between a 5-year-old child and an 11-year-old child and a 17-year-old child (for the definition of child as a person below the age of majority).\n\nI'd not expect a 5-year-old to pay back for a ruined PSP. I could maybe imagine an 11-year-old getting extra chores to \"work off\" the PSP. But I could imagine a 17-year-old taking a bit more responsibility than just \"whoops an accident, sorry\".", "If it wad in a jar, which I presume was glass there is no way ot melted, to melt glass it has to be so freaking hit it would have set your house on fire. She is conning you, tell her to take ya to small claims  ourt and watch her get laughed out of it. She os conning you big time", "No they aren't more expensive. They are actually way cheaper since they are no longer in production the people that sell them now have had them for years so they are worth way less. Paying her $500 for a new one doesn't make sense unless she wants to buy something else with that money. Also since you guys were kids was it her that bought it or your parents? Because if they bought it for her it would be them that was out of the money and not her. EDITED TO ADD that if she does buy one from someone there is a big chance that it won't work because it's hard to tell what condition it is in not everyone is truthful when they sell so she would be risking that money.", "She is 10 years to late", "Accidentally BOUGHT, fixed the typo.", "Nah, because if the sister had wanted a replacement she should have asked then. She shouldn't have waiting to newer versions came out, that's unfair", "then respectfully tell her to fuck off. Either you pay the original price or buy her the same model from 10 years ago.", "I agree with the what bononomous said. If she wanted a replacement she should've asked you when you messed it up. She doesn't deserve to get a new one just because now, after some time, she's decided she wants a new one. That's not how it works.", "[deleted]", "I remember her a few days ago talking to my mother about buying a PSP off of Ebay, but I didn't ask her to elaborate further.", "She's trying to buy a PS4 with that money or drugs", "There's a reason that a statute of limitations exist for legal issues....", "They are way overpriced though", "If it's a brand new (old stock) psp in the box, $1000 seems about right. Factory sealed models are pretty scarce, since Sony stopped making them about 10-15 years ago.\n\nIn 2010, I'm sure used PSPs were probably available used on eBay, in good-fair cosmetic condition, for less than $150.", "She might be looking to get a Nintendo Switch, they are the only thing close to a PSP and they can be around $1000.\n\nOP is NTA and doesn\u2019t owe her sister a replacement 10 years later.", "The oil was in a jar, I remember I also closed the lid tightly before putting it back.", "Ty \ud83d\ude42", "Yes indeed. I would imagine they were somewhere between 11 and 17.", "This all makes alot of since but we are talking 10 years later. If it was a problem at the time then mom should have jumped in and let her know she has to do extra chores or if she's older she has to find a way to pay for it. That's mom's responsibility kids don't just go and punish themselves but for them to demand she do something 10 years later that's a reach and a half", "The glass doesn\u2019t need to melt! Put ice into a jar, seal it, and see what happens!", "But it wasn't your responsibility, it was your parents. And your dad did the right thing. Ops mom did not live up to her responsibility, teaching her kids and helping compensate for the mistake. \n\nNow it's too late. \n\nBtw have you read ops comments? He did not broke the PSP, sisters story of oil melting though a jar is completely unbelievable.", "Well they most definitely do not cost $500 off ebay, she's taking the piss. Do some research, print it off and be done with it.", "Maybe you can go, look for yourself, and get one for the lowest price you can get without it being broken and give it to her. Problem solved, she has the device she wants and you replaced what you broke all these years ago. And if she wantet to pocket the rest then she can bite a lemon or what you say in english", "I have no idea about factory-sealed models current prices, but paying $1,000 won't be a great deal unless it is purchased for sentimental reasons or the purchaser is a collector.", "No way, I just took a look at them on Yahoo Auctions and you are looking at $250 or so MAX for a new PSP. There's brand new limited editions there for well south of $1000", "Switches are nowhere near 1000. The equivalent to a PSP would be a Switch Lite, which are a few hundred tops, and can be bought used for under 200. However, it's not OP's responsibility to pay for an upgrade, and I imagine you can get an old PSP for 100-200 if that.", "She's conning you then.   Or someone else opened the jar and knocked it over.", "I almost think your mom did it and is blaming you, why would she just sheepishly agree with her when a sealed jar somehow leaked coconut oil (unless the room temperature increased a lot not possible) and managed to destroy the PSP", "That's called condensation and is the water from the air.  There was no oil condensation on the jar. \n\nScience is cool!", "Okay, I didn't actually do the research. I just meant that old stuff can sometimes fetch high prices, especially if it's sought after by collectors.\n\nWith that context, demanding $500 doesn't even make sense in 2023 market prices lol.", "My exact thoughts. No one saw him spilling the oil, and neither does OP remembers it. Sony has stopped manufacturing PSP, and no way a used PSP would cost $1,000 (even back then the new one didn't cost $1,000). You can get a brand new PS5 for under $1,000.", "If I even suggest to her that she might've remembered the situation wrong, she will throw the biggest angry tantrum and I will not hear the end of it, I will be toast.", "What I think happened is what happens with alot of siblings and family. The sister broke her own psp and instead of owning up to it she blamed her sister and hasn't let her live it down since", "Coconut oil melts at 24\u00b0c/76f, if the room temperature is above that then the coconut oil would be liquid regardless of whether the jar was open, closed, glass, metal, made of cheese... not saying that the coconut oil could have possibly made it out of a sealed jar but it definitely could be a liquid inside a sealed jar.", "Stop engaging. She's throwing a tantrum because she knows she's lying and she's getting a power trip out of getting a reaction from you. Research \"grey rocking\". And, make sure no one has any access to your money.", "Too bad - from your account, you could not have broken the psp, unless the container either melted or had a hole\n\nAlso, have a look what second hand psps actually cost. The psp was not brand new at the time, so if you would pay her back, it should have been replacement value. I'm going to guess you can take a zero off what she's quoting you\n\nHowever, it has been 10 years and you were children. Ultimately parents are responsible for their children breaking things, and at the same time are responsible for getting the value back. Parents did not replace the psp. Time for her to get over it.", "Throw a bigger tantrum. You must be offensive with such people. Make even more insane demands, her PSP ruined your oil, she owes you $5000 for material and emotional damage."]}
