There's a subreddit for children of hoarders that might be useful, and reading the book Stuff by Gail Stekeetee. \n\nHoarding comes from mental illness and if there's no acknowledgement or treatment of the mental illness then you won't move forward.

You were upfront about no hoards. Your husband should have been stepping way up to get in front of his mother's issues already.

If she bought something that you threw out then that would be different, but it doesn't sound like that is what you are doing", "I think the \"Great Depression\" attitude is a real thing. My parents didn't hoard, but my mom couldn't throw anything away without feeling like she may need it someday. You could tell it was a struggle.

I go around and around with some of my clients about this, and I am not nearly as kind as you or the organizers on TV! If it's expired-OUT! If it's broken- OUT! If it has even the POTENTIAL to be biohazard- OUT! I have clients that I have to physically remove the garbage from the property or pour ammonia in the garbage bags to keep them from bringing it back in.

That said, it's your house. You didn't go into her bedroom, so it's totally ok to throw away useless stuff.", "ESH. She lives there now and contributes to the household. Just talk before throwing stuff away, and give her (reasonable) space to keep what she wants.", "Info I see you told her not to hoard when you moved in, but has that come up since? Did you give her a warning. People who are hoarders sometimes don't recognize their behaviour. Obviously you have a right to a clean and uncluttered house, but she may need professional help", "NTA. If she's a hoarder, she needs help, but you're not remotely obligated to indulge it and give over whole closets to junk.", "NTA. This is the best-case scenario for her; she's able to indulge in her compulsion without the risk of dying under an avalanche of baby food jars.", "I think I would already be divorced if I had to live with a MIL that kept broken trash in my house.", "**YTA for not paying her.** She is basically a domestic slave. 40-50 hours of childcare work a week and all she gets in return is rent and food. That\u2019s fucked up.", "NTA. I have never lived with a hoarder, but I have cleaned out hoarder homes. You need to be firm, hoarding is a mental condition. It won't stop, not without serious help. Taking a hoarders hoard away can cause serious problems. My best friend emptied her mother's hoard while her mother was on an extended trip far away. Went to visit family 5000 miles away for a month. When she came home, her house was clean, normal. She lost her shit. She could literally not function.", "YTA.  You shouldn't throw out other people's stuff without consulting them.

You are trying to protect your family and your home. Your MIL is a \"known\" hoarder. This is difficult.\n\nI agree with the eliminate the junk position; it is important to keep your home clean and clear of problems.\n\nYour MIL needs therapy - no one needs 150 of anything in any urban area of any country.  Hoarding is a real emotional and psychiatric problem. You cannot solve it by throwing out the current accumulation of stuff. She will continue to accumulate, and waste money and time, on the stuff.\n\nWhat does your partner say about their mom? Surely, you've discussed this a few times.", "NAH. Like others said, she needs professional help to deal with her hoarding issues. The comment she made to you stems from those issues. It's good that you are putting in effort to prevent the home from becoming overwhelmed with clutter - easier said than done even without a hoarder in the picture.

I always swore I'd never have one when I moved out. And I didn't, for a few years. Then I moved in with my boyfriend and a random kitchen drawer was being unused, so it became the catch-all for random cords, pushpins, tape, screwdrivers, etc. 2 years later and it's crammed full of crap and I dread cleaning it out.\n\nYou did the right thing.", "Agreed.

I\u2019m definitely not on top of it, we have so much crap in our home but I\u2019m trying little by little. It\u2019s like everytime I clean somewhere another area gets the clutter.

She does know how to \u201cclean\u201d like toys off the floor, sweep, mop, etc. but when it comes to junk I don\u2019t think she actually knows. It\u2019s just keep keep keep", "She\u2019s in her late 60s, I guess I meant because he parents hoarded during the depression", "Also she has her own bedroom and bathroom for keeping whatever she wants. We also have an area in our unfinished basement", "I probably should\u2019ve asked. But with this drawer I kept every single little thing and put it in a bowl for her to determine if she wants. With the closet I had company coming and just did what needed to be done lol", "My husband has spoken with her about it several times. She knows she has a problem but would never admit she\u2019s an actual hoarder. He home before she moved in with us was actually chaos. Like you couldn\u2019t walk through some areas.", "That\u2019s what I think too! I try not to pull the \u201cit\u2019s my house\u201d card, but I will when I need to.", "Hahahah thank you for the comedic relief", "She gets her whole life paid for. We go out to dinner, go boating, go to Tennessee several times a year, etc. she willingly came here to be able to live with her grandchildren.", "Dang that\u2019s crazy! I feel for them but I just can\u2019t have it in my home", "It\u2019s nothing of value. Empty baby food jars, boxes from shipment I receive, old shelves from MY furniture pieces, etc. still agree?", "Maybe, but she has areas in the house that are her own if she wants to hoard in them. The kitchen is not one of those areas.", "The main reason is because she\u2019s from another state and can\u2019t afford a home here. We have 3 levels to our house, so the basement is her area, mostly. We all use the living room down there, but she has her own bedroom and bathroom. She talked about setting up a kitchenette in our basement laundry area, but I think that would just be a mess. My husband and I have gone back and forth many times in the past few years about whether or not it\u2019s worth it. We both are so thankful for her taking care of our kids when they were so young and vulnerable so we didn\u2019t have to send them to a daycare with God knows what happening behind the scenes.

Your spouse needs to do some heavy lifting with that, too. A hoarder given free rein will violate local health and safety codes and severely damage structures. There are children to protect.\n\nYour MIL may have tenant rights, and it'd help if you had a written legal agreement with her signature featuring language about maintenance of clear and clean spaces on the premises and your right to access all areas for upkeep purposes.", "My birthday present this year has been an organizer - once a week for an hour, doing little bits, and seeing how we live with them. It\u2019s been amazing. The linen closet that has been a crap feet for a decade is now useful and things come out and go back into their spot. \n\nAnd it\u2019s helping when we find a plan that doesn\u2019t work - like setting up a new office space for me and crap is accumulating on my desk, so it\u2019s showing that I need a spot in my office for hair stuff for my daughter. She comes in and I do her hair at my desk in the morning because the bathroom doesn\u2019t have good space for it. But my desk shouldn\u2019t be where the hair things go, so I\u2019m getting a little shelf for near my desk that can hold some supplies and the hair stuff.", "Yeah, things like that should be trashed as soon as they're broken if they can't be fixed.  My wife's grandma was a hoarder, it was sooooooo bad when we cleaned out her house we fell through the floor in some areas.", "Obviously hoarding can be a complex psychological issue but I don't think your the ah here it's not like you cleared out personal stuff you literally threw away rubbish!", "You should not have to deal with it. Just be prepared in case she has a meltdown. Good luck. Sorry you are dealing with this.", "Their value to you is not the point.  If they're garbage / worthless to you, but she saves them from the trash, they become hers. She may have a medical condition needing professional treatment.   I'd be saving boxes to move out.", "You speak of value yet you don't demonstrate the value of understanding a hoarding disorder and treating you MIL with respect. it's astounding.", "Are the items kitchen gadgets?", "You are not wrong - BUT: \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are not really appealing to reason and structure with a hoarder? That will not work.\n\nTaking away things causes a scarcity mindset, and that makes hoarding worse.", "Complex and it sounds like your trying to work out a good way of managing it day by day.", "do you mean \"thank you for cleaning up my messy daughter in law self?\"", "Are these specific things occurring in her living space now: can't walk through, no counter surface uncovered?", "I find people who are experts in this fascinating. like an ADD fairy.", "Omg I need this!!!", "Oh my goodness that\u2019s crazy!! That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to prevent. I can\u2019t live like that! It stresses me out as it is right now", "I would never throw away personal stuff! I even have attachments to some personal items so I completely understand that part of it.", "anything that is a kitchen item is still there, plastic sandwich bags, freezer bags, plastic cutlery. That was all put there by me when we first moved in. Everything else is not kitchen related. Tons of random string, random screws, tools, nail polish\u2026 I didn\u2019t throw anything away though. Only one or two lids to bottles we don\u2019t have and broken items.", "Then I get looked at like I\u2019m a monster for doing it and it gives me anxiety \ud83d\ude25", "Are you my mother in law?

Happen? And we throw out a bunch of trash and put things in a box for donation and the space gets things in different spots as we talk about how I use it. And if it works, it kind of flows and it\u2019s pretty easy to put things back in their True Spots. And if it doesn\u2019t, we can tell because crap happens again. \n\nIt\u2019s a great birthday gift.", "That\u2019s the part of hoarding that makes it so hard to treat: their brains literally cannot differentiate between \u201cjunk\u201d and \u201cpersonal items\u201d. Part of the largely emotional outbursts when you clean out the rubbish and acting like you tossed out personal items is that her mental illness makes her brain categorize trash as a personal item. An empty baby food jar is emotionally equivalent to a picture of her mother.", "Yeah that comment - phew! You do well to keep things polite - I know she has a mental illness - but it's hard on you too.", "no thank god you seem awful", "You\u2019d love me\u2026 unless you\u2019re a hoarder"]}
