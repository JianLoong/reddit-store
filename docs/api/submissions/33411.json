When I turned 18 I moved away from home and so we rarely see each other anymore, during a FaceTime last week I proposed the idea that he flies out to my home to stay for a long weekend and we can catch up. I bought the plane ticket in full myself but he does plan to pay for half of it, I already have the time off work approved for when he gets here and I\u2019ve been planning fun activities for us to do when he arrives. \n\nHeres where I might be the AH. I live in a very popular vacation spot, yesterday he asked me if one of his friends could join him for the trip to my home and that he already invited her. I told him I haven\u2019t seen him in over two years and wanted to spend this limited time with him, I also expressed that I am not comfortable housing a stranger in my small home, I\u2019ve only got two bedrooms. \n\nAfter I explained this to him he left me on read all day,  he just texted me back saying that his friends mom went ahead and bought her a plane ticket here anyways and they are both fully expecting me to pick her up and house her for the duration of the trip. \n\nI told my cousin that his friend needs to look into securing sleeping and transportation accommodations or get a plane ticket refund as I will not be providing her a place to stay or transportation around to activities. \n\nHe is very upset with me that I would \u2018ruin\u2019 his friends \u2018surprise\u2019 vacation by not allowing her free accommodation in my home, i feel as though they lied to the friends mother about the circumstances because there\u2019s no way her mom surprised her with only a ticket for the exact days I planned for my cousin to stay here or why they would tell the mother that her daughter would have a place to go after I explicitly said no. \n\nWould I be the AH if I cancel his plane ticket? \n\nTLDR: I bought my cousin a plane ticket to visit me after two years apart and he invited his friend to join behind my back\n\nQuick edit, the friend is not his girlfriend. He has a long term boyfriend who he has been with for almost 3 years and he is violently gay.

You tried to do something nice and now your cousin and his friend want to take advantage of you.", "NTA. I feel like he's probably not thinking this thoroughly, and probably invited her because he told her about his plans and she got excited and suggested to come along. It's probably not his intention, but he is definitely using you even if unintentionally. It's not your responsibility to make sure her \"surprise vacation\" is not ruined. You have no relationship with this girl at all. \n\nPersonally, I would cancel the ticket right now. But you seem to have or had a good relationship with him and you obviously know him better than us internet strangers, so if you want, give him a chance to fix this mess. So I suggest sending him a text or email about how hurt you are and how disrespected you feel that he discussed none of these things with you, and decided on his own that he can use half your money for the tickets, use your house like a hotel, and become a chauffeur for his holiday with his friend. That's never the plan, and blaming this on you is unfair. Tell him that you don't appreciate being taken advantage of by someone you consider a brother, and that you don't think you two should go ahead with the plan for now. See what he says, and if he doesn't set things straight with you, cancel the ticket.", "NTA OP, but before cancelling it, you can require that your cousin reimburse you in full for his plane tickets or you cancel it in 24h. And you let him know that neither him nor his friend can stay with you anymore.", "NTA \n\nNope right out of this. If they want a couples vacation, they can book a room and cousin can pay for his own flight. Get a refund on the ticket and tell him that you would love to host him in the future if he wants to have a proper visit. I'm sorry this happened to you.", "NTA. Surprise your cousin actually isn't that close to you anymore! Cancel that ticket. Do not put up with bad behavior like this.", "NTA - especially if you can cancel and still get a refund.\n\nYour cousin broke the agreement and hasn\u2019t even paid for his half of the ticket yet.

When I turned 18 I moved away from home and so we rarely see each other anymore.\n\nOP, people change. You were like siblings, but now?

And very straightforwardly, you are not able to offer accommodation for both of them because you don't have space. NTA.\n\nBut how could it work if she comes and stays somewhere else and he stays with you and you refuse to include her in transport to activities - would she end up getting an independent uber to the same things you and he are doing...?? That would be mega-awkward. I'm not sure it's realistic.\n\nOne more option you might consider is to say to him that what he has in mind sounds more like a holiday for him and his friend than a reunion for you and him - so why doesn't he find accommodation somewhere else with her, and they can have a nice holiday together (of course he should pay you back for the whole of the plane fare) and in the course of their holiday, you and he can meet up one day for a catch-up?\n\nThat would be a kind way to phrase it, but still get across that what he's done is not OK and he needs to fix it.", "NTA for deciding to cancel his tickets.

NTA.", "NTA. Before the stuff with the mother, I would have suggested that he could come visit you and stay for another few days when his friend come in.

Plus he is showing no respect for your opinion or boundaries.", "NTA \n\nI'm pretty divided whether you should tell him or not. I feel sometimes people learn the hard way, but then the friends MOMs money will go to waist basically. \n\nOn the other hand I feel like you could tell him that you'll cancel the ticket (and do it) only tell him so that he can buy one himself if he and friend still wants to go. That way they can find a place to stay by themselves but at least this way you're not wasting the moms money who is innocent in all of this.", "NTA\n\nYou can assume that this might throw a wrench in your relationship but honestly your cousin already did that.\n\nThis screams that you are going to be used.

No thank you.\n\nCousin is using you so he can be a rockstar with his friend while you get to be the drudge. \n\nNTA. Maybe this will teach your cousin some manners.", "Your cousin is toxic and annoying. Like everyone else says teach him some manners.

This subreddit has convinced me that in addition to  financial literacy, manners need to be taught in school. How does someone reach the age of 20 and not know that if you're invited to stay with someone, that doesn't mean you're entitled to invite another person on your visit? This changes the entire dynamic of the visit. Maybe you should tell your cousin and his friend to get a hotel room and you'll take them out for a nice lunch or something.
