When I turned 18 I moved away from home and so we rarely see each other anymore, during a FaceTime last week I proposed the idea that he flies out to my home to stay for a long weekend and we can catch up. I bought the plane ticket in full myself but he does plan to pay for half of it, I already have the time off work approved for when he gets here and I\u2019ve been planning fun activities for us to do when he arrives. \n\nHeres where I might be the AH. I live in a very popular vacation spot, yesterday he asked me if one of his friends could join him for the trip to my home and that he already invited her. I told him I haven\u2019t seen him in over two years and wanted to spend this limited time with him, I also expressed that I am not comfortable housing a stranger in my small home, I\u2019ve only got two bedrooms. \n\nAfter I explained this to him he left me on read all day,  he just texted me back saying that his friends mom went ahead and bought her a plane ticket here anyways and they are both fully expecting me to pick her up and house her for the duration of the trip. \n\nI told my cousin that his friend needs to look into securing sleeping and transportation accommodations or get a plane ticket refund as I will not be providing her a place to stay or transportation around to activities. \n\nHe is very upset with me that I would \u2018ruin\u2019 his friends \u2018surprise\u2019 vacation by not allowing her free accommodation in my home, i feel as though they lied to the friends mother about the circumstances because there\u2019s no way her mom surprised her with only a ticket for the exact days I planned for my cousin to stay here or why they would tell the mother that her daughter would have a place to go after I explicitly said no. \n\nWould I be the AH if I cancel his plane ticket? \n\nTLDR: I bought my cousin a plane ticket to visit me after two years apart and he invited his friend to join behind my back\n\nQuick edit, the friend is not his girlfriend. He has a long term boyfriend who he has been with for almost 3 years and he is violently gay. \n\nEDIT 2: thank you to the majority of you all, I took your guys advice and explained to my cousin how I feel being a glorified air bnb/driver for him and his friend is not what I planned for this trip, I told him it was inconsiderate to lead his friend to believe that I would house her without knowing her that she needs to look into accommodations and refund on her ticket. He said he will talk to her and he apologized for the situation but I\u2019m not sure what the outcome will be. Will update when he responds.

I feel like he's probably not thinking this thoroughly, and probably invited her because he told her about his plans and she got excited and suggested to come along. It's probably not his intention, but he is definitely using you even if unintentionally. It's not your responsibility to make sure her \"surprise vacation\" is not ruined. You have no relationship with this girl at all. \n\nPersonally, I would cancel the ticket right now. But you seem to have or had a good relationship with him and you obviously know him better than us internet strangers, so if you want, give him a chance to fix this mess. So I suggest sending him a text or email about how hurt you are and how disrespected you feel that he discussed none of these things with you, and decided on his own that he can use half your money for the tickets, use your house like a hotel, and become a chauffeur for his holiday with his friend. That's never the plan, and blaming this on you is unfair. Tell him that you don't appreciate being taken advantage of by someone you consider a brother, and that you don't think you two should go ahead with the plan for now. See what he says, and if he doesn't set things straight with you, cancel the ticket.", "NTA OP, but before cancelling it, you can require that your cousin reimburse you in full for his plane tickets or you cancel it in 24h.

That would be mega-awkward. I'm not sure it's realistic.\n\nOne more option you might consider is to say to him that what he has in mind sounds more like a holiday for him and his friend than a reunion for you and him - so why doesn't he find accommodation somewhere else with her, and they can have a nice holiday together (of course he should pay you back for the whole of the plane fare) and in the course of their holiday, you and he can meet up one day for a catch-up?\n\nThat would be a kind way to phrase it, but still get across that what he's done is not OK and he needs to fix it.", "NTA for deciding to cancel his tickets.

This changes the entire dynamic of the visit. Maybe you should tell your cousin and his friend to get a hotel room and you'll take them out for a nice lunch or something.

My friends frequently fly from my former hometown and occasionally they bring a friend with them who I have never met. They always ask me ahead or time and typically I'll at least exchange some texts with the person ahead of the trip to introduce myself. My friends usually have good judgment about who they bring over and some have become my friends as well! The worst case was when my friend brought a friend who was going through a rough patch and this person was not a good time. She accused me of being in love with my friend's husband. Which is absurd bc I am also married and I love 12 hours away.

But AITA is filled with similar kids this entire week as the overwhelming excitement of adulting during the holidays makes kids do thoughtless things. 20M cousin thought his invitation and accommodations could be extended to his friend because his cousin/sibling is so cool and everyone would have a great time. This was very wrong of him, but at this point the focus should be: \"how can this be the best holiday for all involved?\" He's already apologized, and he's talking to his friend about his mistake. *Maybe* she can afford to stay elsewhere; but very likely this isn't the case as last-minute bookings in a \"popular vacation area\" is going to be crazy-expensive.

I do not want a whole person in my house without a heads up.", "Op I also live in a very popular tourist city with a spare bedroom and unfortunately the truth is some people really take advantage. I\u2019m really sorry it\u2019s happened to you but your doing the right thing. When you live in popular places you have to have firm boundaries on people staying otherwise you end up as a hotel. Your NTA.", "If that was the case they should have asked op first.", "I didn't mean to sound flippant about your concerns, and his behavior is bullshit, but I don't think it's trip canceling bullshit.", "You seem pretty upset about it. Why don't you let cousin and his friend stay with you? Problem solved!", "You were getting a heads up tho? You just decided against them being able to come\u2026", "Yes they should have, but OP said they don\u2019t think their cousin had any ill intent.", "Again, the issue is not financial in nature. Even with emotions running high I\u2019ve never had an issue getting a loan back from him so I\u2019m really not worried about it, if he does decide not to pay me back, it\u2019s not enough money to significantly upset me.\n\nThe entirety of the situation is that I planned for my cousin to come visit, I did not plan on being a third wheel in my own house with a stranger .", "I don\u2019t fucking know dude it doesn\u2019t really matter in this case, his boyfriend couldn\u2019t come uninvited behind my back either.", "Actually my \u2018favorite\u2019 cousin persay, is moving in with me in a few months, I frankly don\u2019t give a shit if their mad lol he\u2019s not going to be living here and my guest room is about to be permanently unavailable so I wanted to catch up with him", "Plenty of people don\u2019t want someone they don\u2019t know spending multiple nights in their house with them. That\u2019s not weird. Being happy about a stranger crashing a vacation you\u2019re helping pay for is way more atypical. OP, i\u2019m glad you told him no. Don\u2019t let someone make you uncomfortable", "Why would that be a \"good compromise\"? You would still use your vacation days to drive her around and spend your time entertaining her. I think this is a POOR compromise.\n\nNTA", "I would add to that, after this conversation if he hasn't apologized, tell him that this isn't what they agreed on, this isn't what she wanted, and she is going to cancel the ticket, but give him the option to buy the ticket from her, to save everyone the hassle.\n\nAt which point he'll probably try to bargain and negotiate, but at that point it's too late.  It **has to** be too late, because any negotiation at that point will be him approaching it as OP owes him a free vacation, and any less that a free vacation will result in resentment.\n\nIf they agree on 'a compromise', OP may think that they are cool, but he is going to be fuming about how OP 'cost him money for a hotel', or 'took his vacation off him', or 'made him look bad in front of his friend' or something.", "Ok. No problem\u2026thanks.  \n\nI\u2019ve found thru life that sometimes things aren\u2019t perfect and sometimes people don\u2019t act the way we wish them to. So we make a choice.  \n\nI\u2019ve always understood that sometimes people don\u2019t act as we expected.  But the general rule for me is: I won\u2019t let the actions of others rule my actions. \n\nI always ask, \u201cwho is the mature one here?\u201d  If it\u2019s me then, maturely, I make the best of a less than perfect situation. \n\nThen, In the future (maybe) I\u2019ve developed an ally. \n\nThen, in the future, (actually) I\u2019ll know never to get myself into that situation again with that person. That person has lost his chance to ever be invited again, except under strict circumstances. \n\nOr not\u2026your call.", "People like all of you think you have a right to shit on your own family.. people you say you love and hide it behind your possessions.. usually bc you are all loser homebodies that never leave your shit houses so people have to come visit you. Then you weird fks pull this shit like everyone else in the world is homeless bc they HAVE to be at your house with your stinky ass animals. The only thing you weirdo's love is the control you have over others.", "\ud83d\udc94\ud83d\ude21Yeah , it's a vacation WITH. A friend at this point! \ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude2d", "I agree with this! \ud83d\ude18\ud83d\udc94", "\ud83d\udc94\ud83d\udc94It hope it really does, his cousin needs to be more considerate \ud83d\udc94\ud83d\ude12", "No, I wouldn\u2019t, they would get their own lodging and transportation and I would see them on a night for dinner, but they would get to spend their vacation together", "If you still want him to come tell them both they have to find accommodations. I would not want a stranger in my and my husband's house. But be prepared if they do find accommodations that yall probably won't get that special time to hang out and you might end up a third wheel anyways. \n\nI don't understand why he decided to bring her if they are close and see each other all the time, when yall haven't seen each other in 2 years. Weird."]}
