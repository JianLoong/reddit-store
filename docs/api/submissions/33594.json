I met my boyfriend earlier this year at my (now ex) best friend\u2019s wedding while a bridesmaid. My friend no longer speaks to me. \n\nFor years, my friend had joked about setting us up because his mom met me and liked me (they are an Indian family; I am white) and we would joke about marrying me into the family and being sisters. It was mostly a joke because we didn\u2019t think we\u2019d ever be compatible. Fast forward six years and I finally met him at the wedding. The groom actually ended up setting us up during a day of day-drinking. The bride was there but she and I didn\u2019t talk about it. \n\nI called her after the wedding to tell her all about it and I let her know we were continuing to talk (I told her I wasn\u2019t sure the purpose behind it as we didn\u2019t live in the same city but that I was enjoying the conversation). She asked me not to talk about him to her while we were talking so that it would\u2019ve affect the friendship. I agreed this was a good plan. \n\nTwo months later, I could sense something was off with her and I asked her how she was feeling about me seeing her cousin (though they think of each other as brother and sister). She blew up at me and said she was upset that I didn\u2019t ask for her consult before dating him. I apologized to her. She asked for space and wasn\u2019t ready to talk about it, but said we would eventually need to if he and I got serious. I gave her space for a few months. When I reached back out, she suggested we talk only in-person if we were ever in the same place (I was living in a different country at the time). Several months later I finally moved in with my boyfriend who lives in the same city as my friend and reached out to her ready to talk. She then told me she\u2019d already withdrawn from our friendship, was unwilling to ever talk to me again, and told me I was \u201cinvading\u201d her family. \n\nAITA for not realizing I needed to ask her for per permission to date him and is her behavior justifiable?", "created_utc": 1703272020, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18omeug/aita_for_getting_together_with_my_friends_close/", "score": 35, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
