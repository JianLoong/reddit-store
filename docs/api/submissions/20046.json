My dad and June asked some time ago, if they could borrow our house a couple of days while we're gone, and we said no problem.

Its your house. Its reasonable to expect to be asked first and reasonable to say no.", "NTA, main reasoning is that it\u2019s extremely disrespectful to invite guests to a house that isn\u2019t yours. We all know the rules of house sitting/ babysitting and those same rules apply to house guests!", "NTA at all. June has no reason to be upset. All you did was say they should\u2019ve asked first. This honestly sounds like an issue with her, and isn\u2019t the fault of you or your family. Stay safe.", "NTA.  \n\nYou agreed to this on the stipulation that it\u2019d be your dad and June. \n\nNow, they wait until super recent after having \u201csome time\u201d to contemplate bringing someone else, to mention it. It\u2019s not courteous or considerate of them at all, point blank.", "NTA. They should have asked you if it was ok to have their granddaughter stay at your house with them before they invited her. Here\u2019s the thing about boundaries: you can set them and you can enforce them, but you can\u2019t make people like them. If your stepmother doesn\u2019t want to stay at your house anymore, that\u2019s her choice to make. I wouldn\u2019t worry about it.", "NTA\n\nYour stepmom invited her granddaughter to use your son's bedroom, without asking either you or your son for permission? That's absurd - what kind of person does that?", "NAH. It sounds like your stepmum doesn\u2019t understand the finer points of autism such as being hyper aware to your environment. If your kids noticed their stuff out of order because of their cousin they could have major meltdowns. And you\u2019re within your rights to have prior notice of houseguests. That said, this seems like it could be avoided if Maria is given strict rules about what she can do at your house. Better communication needed all around I think.", "If Maria comes, she'll be in your kids' rooms and  this will violate their sense of safe space.  Therefore you don't want her to come.  Now she's not coming.  So no harm no foul.\n\nYou probably need to explain your rationale in person so your inlaws understand that you're not rejecting them, but that you have a really good reason.\n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You were simply communicating your needs and boundaries to your family.
