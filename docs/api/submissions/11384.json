I\u2019ve known her and her family for over ten years, we met when I was in middle school and I\u2019ve been \u2018adopted\u2019 by them ever since. I have also known her fianc\u00e9 (31m) and his family for the same amount of time. We are all really close and have all been together since I was in middle school. In total there is about 8 of us in the friend group, and we all were to be apart of the wedding.\n\nShe started all the planning in march of last year. The wedding was supposed to be in October of this year.

Your best friend changed the wedding date and didn't tell one bridesmaid. She must have deliberately created a new group chat excluding you. She must have told all the other bridesmaids, her family, her fiance, who you're also close to, not to contact you. This is a LOT of people all working together to exclude you, if you're as close to them as you say you are. And she knew you had all these people on Facebook and would see the photos and have a massive shock, but she still went ahead and ghosted you rather than telling you she had an issue with you.\n\nThere's nothing that will ever make this okay. You were literally dropped from the most important day of her life with no explanation. Have you received any sort of explanation or apology? You say you haven't answered texts but I assume you read them, what do they say?", "NTA.  You need to have a conversation with your \"friend\" and figure out what happened, especially since you were supposed to be a BRIDESMAID.  Part of the actual wedding.  This all sounds really weird.  Either your friend really sucks, or you're leaving out information.  \n\nBe prepared to cut ties, but at least try to get some closure and understanding of what happened.", "NTA they just changed the date without telling you? You\u2019re obviously more than free to reach out and ask why, but being hurt is understandable.", "This is just bizarre. NTA. They thought they could have an entire wedding and just hide it from you? \n\nI\u2019d reach out to the bride and say that you\u2019re hurt that she uninvited you from the wedding and hid it from you. Ask why. If only for closure for yourself.", "NTA. Holy shit did they do something terrible. I'd never speak to them again. They proved, beyond all doubt, how little you really mean.", "NTA - what is wrong with your mother???\n\nWhat you described is definitely something to react negatively to, so no, you being heartbroken is not an overreaction. Your whole friend group had a wedding you were supposed to be in without you, didn't tell you, still haven't told you (EDIT: I suppose they might be calling and texting now to tell you, but it's still after the fact). That's rude af. It's beyond rude, it's cruel.\n\nIt would be one thing if they told you and said they didn't want you to come. This is on another level of WTF.", "NTA, she showed you that you aren\u2019t an important part of her life. You\u2019re just doing what she wanted you to do and move on. I\u2019d honestly not bother responding at any point in time. While she\u2019s not an AH for not inviting you, she\u2019s absolutely TA for not at least telling you they the date changed and that your invitation had been revoked for whatever reason.", "NTA. What your \"friend\" did was horrid. \n\nI think you are okay to just cut her out, you don't owe her an explanation, she literally used your help and then didn't invite you to her wedding. eff that. \n\nAlso your mother gives bad advice, don't listen to her. \n\nCut out fake friends and move on and live a good life.", "NTA. You have ever right to feel hurt. Being so involved and not even get a message saying things changed is seriously messed up", "NTA, this is a very bizarre situation. I don't understand how they managed to shift a wedding so quickly without any prior notice. Since you said a lot of people were there especially some you didn't recognise, so that means these people were informed well in advance so that they could accommodate the change. \n\nI would just suggest that you should talk to her and ask very casually about how the wedding was and why they moved it up so suddenly? If you didn't know each other for a decade, it wouldn't have mattered but you clearly have a lot of history and seem to be close. Maybe there is some genuine reason that is beyond my comprehension at this point. Talking might help clear the air. \n\nINFO: Did other bridesmaids also attend the wedding?", "This is really strange. I don't think you are overreacting. Are you sure you guys were best friends? You are quite a bit younger than them, espcially for being friends since middle school. I think you owe it to yourself to find out what happened, and then ignore if you wish.\n\nNTA", "INFO:  \n  \n1. You were still involved and helping with the planning per your comments. How did it never come up that the date had changed? This doesn't make sense  \n2.  How did they move up the wedding by several months and get a large party of people to shift plans at short notice. Again this doesn't make sense?  \n3. Venue, photographer, DJ, catering? How did they reschedule all of these so quickly? Again this doesn't make sense to me  \n\nSorry this just doesn't add up to me. Changing a large wedding at very short notice whilst not impossible would be challenging and expensive. Also lot's of the components just aren't easy to switch without you noticing even if you were tangentially involved. NTA but I'm highly skeptical of the whole thing.", "NTA. You are understandably hurt, and deserve time to process it. However, you need to tell your friend this at some point. And honestly, she\u2019s no longer worthy of being your friend.", "NTA\nI would ask them once about the wedding and then bre contact. It's very strange that they told you the wrong wedding date..Unbelievable so I am curious about the whole story.", "You are not the arsehole but you should ask them why you werent invited\u2764\ufe0f ofc you are hurt and that is really sad that they did this to you\ud83d\ude22", "NTA, and your hurt is justified, but you can't avoid them forever. It sounds like they don't know the reason you're avoiding them from your comments. They most likely don't know you found out about the wedding.\n\nThis is going to be a problem you will have to confront. Find out from the bride first why she moved the wedding date and didn't tell you. Did she just forget? Did everyone just forget? Did nobody notice you, her supposed best friend, weren't there? Extremely unlikely.\n\nDepending on the answer you get, you might have to reevaluate your relationships not just with the bride, but all of your other friends who were in attendance.", "NTA. I can't imagine what's happened here, but it sounds as if you have been treated dreadfully.", "NTA. If they needed to cut you from the wedding for any reason (regardless of whether or not you agree with the reason), they should have been grown ups about it and told you. Doing it behind your back (but then being dumb enough to post it on social media) is just bizarre. And what did they think would happen?? That you would just never find out??\n\nI would go for option 1) block and move on, or option 2) read their messages and respond with a frank \u201cwhy did you feel the need to have your wedding without me? I don\u2019t understand why you didn\u2019t feel you could communicate this to me, and went behind my back\u201d for closure.\n\nEither way, I think it\u2019s safe to say they\u2019re not close friends anymore. Keep them at a distance.", "NTA. If you need to know what happened for closure then respond to texts letting them know that this was a very hurtful experience. That you don't know why your \"friends\" would ghost you like this, but you deserve better. Given that, you will be moving on with your life and you wish them the best, but going forward the friendships seem to have met their expiration date.\n\nEat a couple of pints of Ben and Jerry's, wallow a bit, and then think of all the things you want to do and start planning a life without them in it.", "NTA that's deeply hurtful for a friend to do to you. Also what the hell is wrong with your mom?", "NTA. you should talk to the bride and IMO tell her off for what she did. It\u2019s not like she couldn\u2019t get a hold of you. I would also ask for any money you have spent for the wedding back. She isn\u2019t your friend if she cut you out like this. Who does that?!?", "NTA\n\nYou just got yourself out of their way for good. And since there's no reason for uninvinting you & for not being told by any of them, it seems you won't miss a thing by not having them in your life.", "NTA,  this is so strange. To ask you to be a bridesmaid and then leave you out?", "NTA, have you asked the other bridesmaids or any mutual friends about it? Really bizarre", "NTA and the whole thing is so bizzare", "What the...\n\nWow. You're NTA. Your entire friend group seems to be", "NTA. but i wouldn\u2019t ice everyone out (but still be NC with bride and groom) because then they\u2019ll see it as you making their special day about you. i would just talk to everyone else because clearly the bride and groom lied to you and about you. talking to everyone else because thats how you\u2019ll find the truth if you want it. but they\u2019ve show you who they are its time to end that chapter of your life and find new friends.", "And please update us!! I\u2019m emotionally invested in this now.. I\u2019m offended and hurt for you..", "NTA She obviously started a group chat without you.  She told some people not to tell you about the new details.  If you don't tell the others that she ghosted you, she will control the story.  I would tell everyone that will listen that she ghosted you and you have no idea why.  Then move on with your life.  She did you dirty.", "NTA. They showed you exactly what they thought of you. This was planned out and 100% intentional. When people show you their true colors, believe your eyes. \n\nI think you shoukd cut them all out of your life like a cancer. I wouldn't ever say another word to any of them. Don't waste your time on people who treat you like disposable waste.", "Text her to meet you for a smoothie or coffee and ask her what happened.  Today!\nDon't react with anger. React with sadness and get thecinfo on why you were not even invited at all.", "ESH, but I totally understand why you would feel so hurt by this.   I don\u2019t think you should act like nothing happened and it wasn\u2019t a big deal.\n\nI do think refusing to answer texts and phone calls is not the best solution though.  I\u2019d suggest reaching out to the bride directly.  Let her know that you took some time to yourself to digest what had happened and didn\u2019t feel ready to talk about it right away because you were so surprised and hurt.  Ask her what happened and why she chose to exclude you.  I\u2019m willing to bet something happened that made her feel hurt and rejected by you.  \n\nIt\u2019s very telling that the whole wedding party kept this from you.  So either there was a huge misunderstanding or you were completely MIA to the extent that everybody assumed the friendship was lost.   Whatever happened, you won\u2019t be able to move past it if you don\u2019t have an honest conversation about what happened  on both sides.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
