It\u2019s just a stressful and impossible situation.  Give yourselves a break.", "NAH, just two people with different and equally valid medical situations. Of course you want your husband to be with you when you when you deliver your child. It's a scary and painful situation. And if this is a child that he desires, then he is asking you to be in pain during childbirth, isn't he?\n\nThat said, it sounds like it will be excruciating for him to be there, so you have to recognize that. His pain is valid, too. Is there some compromise you think you can make?

Unless this is a legitimately emergency surgery, he should be putting it off until after things are settled with the baby.", "YTA.  Renounce his child?  What kind of insufferable AH would say something like this?  You are three months out from birth and he did not say he wouldn't be there.  He brought up the fact that he might not be able to be there.  This isn't even a hard call.  Of course he wants to be there.

I can't know.\n\nPain is regularly underestimated and undermined by people and doctors. The fact that some places expect people to move around the day after a C-section doesn't negate that expecting that is insane to expect and that you're perpetuating those ideas onto others. It's the epitome of if others have to suck it up then you do to.

Check your empathy levels! It sounds as if you think your pain is more \"important\" than his.\n\nIt doesn't matter that his condition \"would not get worse\" by standing; why should he have to stand if it leaves him in pain?", "YTA. You agree that his pain is a huge obstacle but you would prefer for him to be there for you in excruciating pain until he collapses at the hospital to somehow show you the depth of his commitment for you?

He\u2019s not the one giving birth he can literally just lay there, the point is that he\u2019s present. I\u2019m normally a very nonchalant, don\u2019t give a fuck about anything type of person but being present for the birth of your child is one of the few things in life that I think are nonnegotiable unless him being there is literally a threat to his health/life.", "YTA - he is not abandoning you, he has a legitimate medical reason for not being there. \n\nYou are minimizing his level of pain, unless you are him, how do you know the level of pain he is in and how it effects him.\n\nIf he is in pain, how effective is he going to be during the birth?", "I can understand you wanting your partner with you. I would brainstorm ways to make that possible, but it might not work out. Maybe you can get a cot set up in the room. Maybe there\u2019s a couch he can take breaks on in the waiting area. Maybe he can schedule his pain meds so that he can be there. Or utilize other pain relief methods like heat or ice or a TENS unit. But, be prepared that they may not be able to be there. \n\nYou need to think about WHY you want him there. If it\u2019s for support, you need to find someone else. If your partner is in pain, they will not be able to effectively support you and they won\u2019t be able to advocate for you or even make the best decisions if something goes wrong. You need a trusted person that can do all of those things. You also need to consider that if they use all their energy trying to be there for the birth, they might not be in good shape to take care of you once you get home. \n\nIf you want them there because you think they need to be there because it\u2019s an important moment, then I\u2019d leave it to them to decide if it\u2019s important enough to risk not being at their best after you\u2019re all home from the hospital. \n\nNAH", "Yta.

Then my blood pressure tanked in seconds, dropped to 60/40. My heart started struggling. I was vomiting uncontrollably. The surgeon immediately started the surgery without waiting for my mom to scrub in. I was literally dying on the operating table. They got my baby out, held her up so I could see her, then had to whisk her away to NICU because the OBGYN said her kidneys and pancreas weren't functioning properly. I can remember seeing my blood on the white tile and how red it seemed.  That is all I remember until hours later.\n\nMy mom filled the rest in, she said I had gone totally gray, and that I was in and out of consciousness. They attached leads to my chest and had a crash cart in the room because they were convinced my heart was going to stop. My mom was calling family to tell them that I was possibly going to die, but that the baby was born. I can't imagine how terrifying it was for her. My kids dad isn't in the picture so it was just my mom at the delivery.

When she said she will be in pain for the both of them to make a family got me. To be frank they chose to get pregnant which means giving birth. That was a choice they made but him being like he is now was not a choice. She herself said he can only be in less pain by laying down.", "Try anything as in for pain? She said the pain is still unbearable even with strong pain killers and laying down is all that helps him. He also may not for certain but may need a second surgery. She also said she believes he's in the level of pain he's in and she trusts him and not his doctors. So what more is he to do? They are hoping he will get better and not need another surgery but he hasn't improved.", "No, I don\u2019t put anybody\u2019s pain above anyone\u2019s. \nHim being there doesn\u2019t change ANYTHING, other than providing few superficial psychological benefits to her. Yet it creates even more very real physical pain for him.\n\nThe logic \u201cI\u2019m women in pain and so he should be fine to experience some as well\u201d is seriously flawed. \n\nI have exactly same question to OP as commenter above me: \u201cWTF is wrong with you. Why would you want for him to be in pain? However small and insignificant that pain feels to you\u201d\n\nI would never want someone I truly love to experience any unnecessary pain and would do everything in my power for him/her to avoid it, regardless of social norms, public opinion, or my psychological comfort.\n\nIt\u2019s not a silly game \u201cwho\u2019s pain is stronger\u201d ffs. But OP shows incredible level of selfishness here.", "Oh he absolutely needs to be talking with his doctors and seeing a pain management doctor. Something absolutely is wrong with how his surgery went and he needs to get care as well as it isn't normal.", "With all due respect, it seems you are a teenager, and probably male so I don't think you understand the weight of these situations. The risks are not at all the same, the complications are astronomically higher with birth. I also wouldn't imagine not being in the hospital with my husband if he was going in for a minor surgery, because yes, there is a risk of death. And you are allowed to not want your partner who \"wasn't feeling fine\" making your life and death decisions. I personally don't want to die alone in childbirth, or have to deliver a baby that died without my husband there.", "She can get pain relief if needed. He won't. \n\nDisappointing, yes. Expecting him to suffer because she has to? Absolutely not.", "Honestly I don't see a problem with what they wrote and I have some pretty solid chronic pain.\nYou'd best bet Id still attend hospital for somebody who was delivering my child, no matter what state I was in.", "How is it sexist? I have a herniated disc myself and narrowing of my neural canal on both sides. I'm saying it's not so horrific that you'd not be able to support your missus going through the birth of your child. \nHow is it hypocritical to state that something you suffer with isn't as bad as childbirth.\nYou know how I know this? Because it's not as bad as endometriosis, which is often compared with childbirth pain. It's another level of pain that I wouldn't wish on anybody.\nWhen you're vomiting and passing out on a regular basis from pain alone, come back and tell me how much worse a herniated disc is than everything else.\nSometimes you have to make the decision between your own discomfort and someone elses.\nA prolapsed disc with chord compression would be another story", "i\u2019ve said my point. phsycology is a massive part of pain and it always will be.", "To each their own\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Get pain relief? Not always. Guess what I got after the epidural for the c-section wore off? Panadol (Tylenol). The pain was extreme. Not uncommon.", "Mine had a recliner and pull-out bed! And having slept beside my toddler when he couldn\u2019t breathe - the recliner is pretty good", "Him passing out etc during this isn't going to help anything. Plus, I'd be stressed over my husband's pain the entire time. \n\nI really hate the \"you must suffer because I have to\" mind frame. Let him be comfortable and safe at home, and video call. It sucks, but everyone can be as comfortable as possible.", "That's my thing, it sounds like he's going to be in just as much pain sitting at home as he would ne in the hospital with his family. \n\nI'd bet anything he finds himself in too much pain to participate the parenting of their children, unless of course it's something fun, then he'll bravely find the strength", "If taking Tylenol provided even a glimpse of relief for you, you're not qualified to discuss pain.", "You clearly haven't had a split and bulging disc because I have gone through child birth twice and I have had a split disc that healed wrong and pressed against my spine. I was on morphine for weeks to just be able to walk to the mailbox and get around my house and stay out of hospital \n\nChildbirth took me a few days to recover from while my back took a year and rehab after surgery \n\nBut the sexism and hypocritical attitude is because you didn't say \"don't compare pain\" when the original comment said child pain was \"the worse pain\"", "Yes, including OP. She's allowed to want the only person legally responsible for her and their child to be present when she's going through statistically the most dangerous things she and their child will ever experience. You're allowed to not want the same.", "they sent me home with percocet. was warranted bc i tore a bit, but i only needed a few. threw the rest away", "Yeah recovery is rough. But the entire process doesn't have to be excruciating, but his entire experience could be. \n\nI'm sorry your pain wasn't addressed better.", "Unfortunately I have irritable bowl syndrome and my GI doctor prescribed me Tylenol only after being prescribed 800 mg tablets of ibuprofen to be take up to 6x a day to manage my chronic pain for 2 years. I\u2019m a child of addicts so I cannot take addictive pain substances. You must have missed the part where I contemplated suicide because of my chronic pain. \n\nPeople are allowed to discuss pain even if they can\u2019t treat it in a way you deem fit. Your reply screams of ignorance.", "Some people have no idea. My mother has to take two separate opiates just to take the edge off the pain.", "I don't know what you're on about, but as somebody that has been on a cane for years due to crippling pain, yeah, no. I wish taking any type of medication provided any relief. It doesn't. There isn't something for me to take to prepare- only pain.", "Unfortunately pain medication rarely provides relief, including Tylenol unless taken in extreme doses for chronic pain sufferers. \n\nYou walk with a cane, I walk with a limp and special shoe. You can argue semantics about your judgement on my pain tolerance endlessly, but it\u2019s missing the point of everything else that was stated.", "Different people react to meds different, does this really have to devolve into a who's foot hurts worse pissing contest. Can't you just say \"damn, that sucks, I have a bum foot too, I know it can ne really tough\"\n\nDoes diminishing someone else's experience some how improve your existence? Jesus fucking Christ, don't fuck up your other leg when you get off that high horse of yours."]}
