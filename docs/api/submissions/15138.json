Of course you want your husband to be with you when you when you deliver your child. It's a scary and painful situation.

Unless this is a legitimately emergency surgery, he should be putting it off until after things are settled with the baby.", "YTA.  Renounce his child?  What kind of insufferable AH would say something like this?  You are three months out from birth and he did not say he wouldn't be there.  He brought up the fact that he might not be able to be there.  This isn't even a hard call.  Of course he wants to be there.

I can't know.\n\nPain is regularly underestimated and undermined by people and doctors. The fact that some places expect people to move around the day after a C-section doesn't negate that expecting that is insane to expect and that you're perpetuating those ideas onto others. It's the epitome of if others have to suck it up then you do to.

Check your empathy levels! It sounds as if you think your pain is more \"important\" than his.\n\nIt doesn't matter that his condition \"would not get worse\" by standing; why should he have to stand if it leaves him in pain?", "YTA. You agree that his pain is a huge obstacle but you would prefer for him to be there for you in excruciating pain until he collapses at the hospital to somehow show you the depth of his commitment for you?

He\u2019s not the one giving birth he can literally just lay there, the point is that he\u2019s present. I\u2019m normally a very nonchalant, don\u2019t give a fuck about anything type of person but being present for the birth of your child is one of the few things in life that I think are nonnegotiable unless him being there is literally a threat to his health/life.", "YTA - he is not abandoning you, he has a legitimate medical reason for not being there. \n\nYou are minimizing his level of pain, unless you are him, how do you know the level of pain he is in and how it effects him.\n\nIf he is in pain, how effective is he going to be during the birth?", "I can understand you wanting your partner with you. I would brainstorm ways to make that possible, but it might not work out. Maybe you can get a cot set up in the room. Maybe there\u2019s a couch he can take breaks on in the waiting area. Maybe he can schedule his pain meds so that he can be there. Or utilize other pain relief methods like heat or ice or a TENS unit. But, be prepared that they may not be able to be there. \n\nYou need to think about WHY you want him there. If it\u2019s for support, you need to find someone else. If your partner is in pain, they will not be able to effectively support you and they won\u2019t be able to advocate for you or even make the best decisions if something goes wrong. You need a trusted person that can do all of those things. You also need to consider that if they use all their energy trying to be there for the birth, they might not be in good shape to take care of you once you get home. \n\nIf you want them there because you think they need to be there because it\u2019s an important moment, then I\u2019d leave it to them to decide if it\u2019s important enough to risk not being at their best after you\u2019re all home from the hospital. \n\nNAH", "Yta.

They often ask if dads or other guests are squeamish around blood for this reason. \n\nIt could also be a really long labor. I just think you should prepare yourself for not having him there and get some help wherever you can ahead of time. Have you thought about after the birth? What if he can\u2019t really be mobile to help out with the newborn back at home?

There was 0 indication that there was a chance of danger to the baby. They just said she was measuring large for her apparent gestational age, and since 37 weeks was viable they wanted to take her out then rather than in 3 weeks when I was at term. I did have hypermesis gravidarum while pregnant (morning sickness on crack) but otherwise was fine.\n\nEverything was smiles and laughter until they put the spinal block in for the c-section. Then my blood pressure tanked in seconds, dropped to 60/40. My heart started struggling. I was vomiting uncontrollably. The surgeon immediately started the surgery without waiting for my mom to scrub in. I was literally dying on the operating table. They got my baby out, held her up so I could see her, then had to whisk her away to NICU because the OBGYN said her kidneys and pancreas weren't functioning properly. I can remember seeing my blood on the white tile and how red it seemed.  That is all I remember until hours later.\n\nMy mom filled the rest in, she said I had gone totally gray, and that I was in and out of consciousness. They attached leads to my chest and had a crash cart in the room because they were convinced my heart was going to stop. My mom was calling family to tell them that I was possibly going to die, but that the baby was born. I can't imagine how terrifying it was for her. My kids dad isn't in the picture so it was just my mom at the delivery. I ended up being in the hospital for 5 days longer than originally planned, and recovery was brutal.\n\nNow ask your husband if he wants to get the phone call that his baby is born but his wife might not survive.

He isn't just there for moral support - she needs someone to make very important calls.\n\nThere are lots of places to lay down in a hospital- my birthing room had a pull out bed thing for spouses.  There was another room with a queen sized bed for natural births.  \n\nDoctors generally are not a fan of patients recovering by lying down all day - they had me up and moving less than 12 hours after my c-section and were constantly reminding me to move around.  My dad was on his feet the day after his knee replacement- again they wanted him moving and doing physical therapy.  I really want to know what his doctor says to the idea of him lying down for a solid month after a non invasive procedure they gave him three days downtime for.

The hard thing is, being selfish about your own pain/when you\u2019re in a lot of pain is biologically hardwired.

I'm not sure how likely that is, given that I have never given birth nor have had to watch someone give birth, but they can certainly at least try.", "It can be scary, but you cannot control everything about the world around you during the 9 months you are pregnant. All you can do is lay your best plans and preparation, and use that to deal with the hand you are dealt.\n\nYour husband could be in too much pain to join. He could be feeling better. He could be hit by a car the day before you give birth. These are all things outside of your control. You need to do everything you can do to be ready for your medical procedure/birth, but also recognize that not everything may go exactly as planned.\n\nAdditionally, if he goes to the hospital and is in so much pain he collapses, this could take away from your care. It could also take away from him being able to aid you with the newborn for a time after the birth.\n\nYou are both going through something that is painful and potentially scary. You most likely chose yours. He did not. Work on being there for each other and doing what you can do, and recognizing what you cannot, instead of blaming him for something he cannot control. It will do no one any good if he is there and in so much pain that he cannot engage in what is happening and is a distraction for your care team.", "I understand what you're thinking, but what I'm saying is that it may not be the best option.  If you force him to be there and he's in too much pain,not only will it ruin the experience for him, but it likely won't help you either.  You need someone to be there to support you, but if he's in pain on on pain killers,  how much support is he going to be? \n\nIt's also normal here in the US to have your partner with you, but again,  not always possible.

I\u2019d be a little less trusting of somebody incapacitate for 7x longer than the doctor says is standard, but you say you trust him.

Telling men to \"man up\" is gross and outdated by the way, don't follow the ways of the patriarchy.

I think someone put it best in a comment below, (I'm paraphrasing) \"she wants him to be physically there, but no matter how hard she wishes or how hard he tries, he won't be mentally there because of the pain he's in. Does she really want her baby's first look at their father to be of a man who's face is contorted in pain?\"\n\nIf he's in enough pain, it wouldn't matter whether he's there or not, it would make zero difference. He wouldn't have the ability to do anything for her. Again it's a really difficult scenario, and of course OP has every right to be angry or upset, but she shouldn't be taking it out on him. He is trying his best."]}
