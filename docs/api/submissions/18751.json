And your \"friends\" who tell you to do what your parents want are not friends. \n\nYour future is yours to live, and should live for yourself. Anyone demanding otherwise should be looked at as dead weight to drop when you are on your own.", "NTA \n\nYou do you.

Becoming a surgeon takes the better part of a decade. The person you realize that goal will be very different from the person you are today.

Really?", "NTA. \n\nBut... try not to be too mad at your parents. In addition to whatever religious baggage they want you to carry, they are probably coming to terms with their aging/mortality and want to feel like you are on your way to something they recognize as a stable adulthood. \n\nAlso... Try not to take too much advice from any \"friends\" who think you should get married out of some sort of obligation to your parents.

Not something to be rushed into. \n\nAnd if you chose wrong, due to failure to take the time to consider your choices, or the natural mistakes of youth, I strongly suspect that your parents would oppose any efforts to undo a poorly made decision through divorce.\n\nI suggest that you look up a few verses in the Bible from Paul, about how, while he understands some people want to marry, he wishes everyone was single like he was, and that it is an appropriate way to live.  \n\nIf your parents raised you in a typical US conservative protestant church, you've been taught to proof-text.  Time to use that skill for your own ends, not just parroting the approved texts for the carefully scripted \"questions\" they teach.", "NTA!
