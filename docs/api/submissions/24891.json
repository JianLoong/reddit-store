This what really made me doubt my decision, since I don't see myself as a selfish person.", "The thing is though they're using the argument that they spent their inheritance on more productive things, and if I'm going on a vacation that I should at the very least invite them, since that is what our grandparents would've wanted according to them. Most of the family except for our dad is on their side and thinks I'm being selfish, which is what's making me doubt myself.", "Thank you!", "Seeing all of these positive comments is really enlightening me. Thank you very much!", "Thanks! It's really hard though to show them how I feel about the situation when almost everyone is on their side. Pretty much only my Dad and one of our aunts are supporting me in this situation. Even when I try to hold a discussion with them they either give me the cold shoulder or call me selfish, and then proceed to ignore everything I try to tell them.

I'm pretty sure we all got the same amount  of literal money, unless they've been hiding something from me.", "No. They got money also. If they want to come they should pay their own way.", "I also thought of this solution. The thing is I'm still slightly reluctant to part with some of my inheritance to pay for their vacation. Am I being selfish?", "Uh, what? They each got an equal portion.  If there are specific uses requested that can be put in a will as well.", "So are the siblings assholes too?  They're spending their money on student loans and their career. Neither has anything to do with OP.", "Seriously? If someone cares that much, there should be a stipulation in the will that the money has to be used for X purpose. Otherwise, it's the OP's money to do as they choose.", "No, not at all. We almost never travel anywhere with each other. We also barely share any interests so it wouldn't make sense for them to travel with me. At this point I've already realised that they're just trying to get free vacation, and I'm starting to question how some of our family members sided with them.", "Thanks for the advice. I don't really need evidence since everyone already knows that they want me to pay for them, which most members of our family agree with. I still don't fully know how to tackle this, since I really want our relationship to go back to normal, but at the same time I don't want to spend my inheritance on them when they got a similar amount of money.\n\nEdit: Changed Liquid to money.", "Thank you very much! Do you mean r/solotravel?", "Thanks! I'm considering having a similar trip, only difference being I'm going to Spain and some Islands close to it instead of Belgium. I'll consider all the advice I've got and confront my family one last time. Thanks again!", "NTA. Please don't do it, because it will no longer your dream vacay. This is YOURS.  Do not cave. Tell everyone that has commented that this subject is no longer up for discussion.\nIf someone starts texting/taking about it. Simply do not respond.", "I was 21 when I traveled around the world by myself.

If you're using a good chuck on vacation I assume you could use the rest on bills and stuff so how is that any different then them paying student loans etc, they could use whats left to take a vacation, so same thing just backwards....

Send it to both of them, and tell them when they transfer the total amount for their share to your bank account, you will modify your reservations to include them on the trip.\n\nWhen they inevitably refuse and they and your parents complain, send the costs to your parents, and tell them when your parents transfer the trip costs x 2 into your bank account, you will modify your reservations to include your siblings on the trip. Do the same with any family member flying monkeys who harass you about this.\n\nThen ignore all of them, and go on your trip.", "Nope nope nope. You get to spend your inheritance on what you want to do. They have spent theirs on what they wanted.  They don\u2019t get your inheritance also.  This is a money grab. Go travel and have adventures- send them postcards.", "NTA no that's just nuts. So they spent their inheritance on whatever they wanted and you must spend your inheritance on them?

The entitlement is pretty disgusting and I don't understand why your other family is backing them up.", "I was already going to say NTA,  but them expecting you to pay for them absolutely cements the issue.

YOU need to share yours or YOU are selfish.  What utter BS.  Ignore them!  They did what they wanted with their money and you are doing the same.", "Most of your family can suck it!

That's not even an argument. Like you can spend it on x, y, z for yourself but if you're doing a,b,c you have to pay for your siblings? It doesn't even make sense.", "You can invite them all you want, as long as they pay their own way.", "I think it\u2019ll be hard to repair the relationship because the fault it with them; they\u2019re the ones being entitled, thinking that they deserve your money just because you\u2019re not putting it into so-called \u201cresponsible\u201d things like them. I don\u2019t think you can change their mindset. You\u2019ve just got to stick to your guns and go. \n\nBesides, even if you had extra money left over, why should it go to them?

At best, you could invite them to join you for a portion of your vacation, like the thing they\u2019d most want to join you on. But they\u2019d have to pay for themselves (do NOT pay a thing for them!) and it sounds like that\u2019s not what they want.\n\nHonestly, I know it hurts but why mend a relationship they chose to break because they\u2019re entitled and selfish? Don\u2019t give in to their brattiness!\n\nAlso, maybe show them this post and point out that literally everyone outside the family thinks they\u2019re selfish.

Why do they get to spend your part of the inheritance? That's what you need to ask them. What makes them more entitled to your money than you are?

I've already told them this but they always just tell me that they're using it more \"productively\" and that I should make a vacation for all three of us, since that is what our grandparents would've wanted. Also I don't think I would be able to go NC with them, since they're still my family and I hope that whatever happens in the future they move on.
