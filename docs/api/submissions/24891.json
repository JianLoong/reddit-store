This what really made me doubt my decision, since I don't see myself as a selfish person.", "The thing is though they're using the argument that they spent their inheritance on more productive things, and if I'm going on a vacation that I should at the very least invite them, since that is what our grandparents would've wanted according to them. Most of the family except for our dad is on their side and thinks I'm being selfish, which is what's making me doubt myself.", "Thank you!", "Seeing all of these positive comments is really enlightening me. Thank you very much!", "Thanks! It's really hard though to show them how I feel about the situation when almost everyone is on their side. Pretty much only my Dad and one of our aunts are supporting me in this situation. Even when I try to hold a discussion with them they either give me the cold shoulder or call me selfish, and then proceed to ignore everything I try to tell them.

I'm pretty sure we all got the same amount  of literal money, unless they've been hiding something from me.", "No. They got money also. If they want to come they should pay their own way.", "I also thought of this solution. The thing is I'm still slightly reluctant to part with some of my inheritance to pay for their vacation. Am I being selfish?", "Uh, what? They each got an equal portion.  If there are specific uses requested that can be put in a will as well.", "So are the siblings assholes too?  They're spending their money on student loans and their career. Neither has anything to do with OP.", "Seriously? If someone cares that much, there should be a stipulation in the will that the money has to be used for X purpose. Otherwise, it's the OP's money to do as they choose.", "No, not at all. We almost never travel anywhere with each other. We also barely share any interests so it wouldn't make sense for them to travel with me. At this point I've already realised that they're just trying to get free vacation, and I'm starting to question how some of our family members sided with them.", "Thanks for the advice. I don't really need evidence since everyone already knows that they want me to pay for them, which most members of our family agree with. I still don't fully know how to tackle this, since I really want our relationship to go back to normal, but at the same time I don't want to spend my inheritance on them when they got a similar amount of money.\n\nEdit: Changed Liquid to money.", "Thank you very much! Do you mean r/solotravel?", "Thanks! I'm considering having a similar trip, only difference being I'm going to Spain and some Islands close to it instead of Belgium.

Send it to both of them, and tell them when they transfer the total amount for their share to your bank account, you will modify your reservations to include them on the trip.\n\nWhen they inevitably refuse and they and your parents complain, send the costs to your parents, and tell them when your parents transfer the trip costs x 2 into your bank account, you will modify your reservations to include your siblings on the trip. Do the same with any family member flying monkeys who harass you about this.\n\nThen ignore all of them, and go on your trip.", "Nope nope nope. You get to spend your inheritance on what you want to do. They have spent theirs on what they wanted.  They don\u2019t get your inheritance also.  This is a money grab. Go travel and have adventures- send them postcards.", "NTA no that's just nuts. So they spent their inheritance on whatever they wanted and you must spend your inheritance on them?

That's not even an argument. Like you can spend it on x, y, z for yourself but if you're doing a,b,c you have to pay for your siblings? It doesn't even make sense.", "You can invite them all you want, as long as they pay their own way.", "I think it\u2019ll be hard to repair the relationship because the fault it with them; they\u2019re the ones being entitled, thinking that they deserve your money just because you\u2019re not putting it into so-called \u201cresponsible\u201d things like them. I don\u2019t think you can change their mindset. You\u2019ve just got to stick to your guns and go. \n\nBesides, even if you had extra money left over, why should it go to them?

At best, you could invite them to join you for a portion of your vacation, like the thing they\u2019d most want to join you on.

Don\u2019t give in to their brattiness!\n\nAlso, maybe show them this post and point out that literally everyone outside the family thinks they\u2019re selfish.

Why do they get to spend your part of the inheritance? That's what you need to ask them. What makes them more entitled to your money than you are?

Either way thanks for the advice!", "Enjoy your dream!", "NTA, my brother and I are identical by character so I know we\u2019d take one another and have fun and we always help one another out but it\u2019s YOUR money", "NTA It never works to vacation with someone who vacation differently. It just ruins both your vacations. Your siblings are unrealistic. Traveling with either of my sisters had a limit of 7 days before things went downhill and we got along great. I wouldn\u2019t survive weeks of that.", "NTA Are they planning to pay off your loans or invest in your career? I didn't think so. What's stopping them from traveling with *their* inheritance? Nothing.", "If they really wanted to go with you then they should use their inheritance to pay their way \n\nNTA at all \n\nEnjoy your trip", "NTA. Your siblings are entitled AH. Their attitude is \u201cwhat\u2019s mine is mine and what\u2019s yours is mine too!\u201d. What absolute BS. If they want to join in on the vacation so much they should pay their own way. If your parents think it\u2019s soooo unfair you aren\u2019t inviting them then they should be offering to pay for them. \n\nDon\u2019t give in to this pressure. You aren\u2019t being selfish whatsoever. They are entitled AH who are trying to manipulate you into spending your inheritance on THEM\u2026 yet they call YOU selfish?!!! BS!", "NTA\n\nYou did nothing wrong. You should go and enjoy life. It sounds like they wanted to pay off their bills then have you treat them. If they went would you get to do what you want to or would you have to do everything they want to do? Go, enjoy your trip and make a lot of good memories. Heck even do a travel blog for each place you go to. Make it a trip to remember!", "NTA. It's your decision around who you want around on your trip.  \n\n\nINFO: Was it their expectation that you would pay for their trip? Or would they spend their money?", "NTA, they didn't spend any of theirs on you??????", "NTA. They spent their inheritance on other things, you want to spend it on traveling. You haven\u2019t done anything wrong and they\u2019re entitled for expecting you to include them. You\u2019re all adults who have your own lives and enjoy different things. They can plan their own trip if they want to travel so bad. It\u2019s rude to invite yourself on someone else\u2019s trip anyways.

You\u2019re starting to piss me off", "Yes!\n\nI have traveled with many types of groups/ages/etc...a romantic partner is the best, but def second best is solo. Completely free to wake up at any time, stay in bed or get going early, eat where ever/when ever you decide, go all day or chill at a coffee shop, etc. \n\nThe worst, by far, is with people  one is not in sync with as the whole trip is a big power struggle. The way to handle that though is to get good boundaries and enjoy your own trip and not feel obligated to do everything together.", "If it was that important to them, why didn't the siblings offer to help pay for this \"family\" vacation with their portion of the inheritance?", "Errrmmm parents can pay costs x3 thank you! Why should siblings get a free trip and keep all their inheritance and OP have to pay themselves?\n\nPlus a booking fee for all the work OP has done....20% of the total cost (ie total for 3 people) seems appropriate.", "OP's the oldest.  There's your answer.", "I am glad they didn't. It would be ruined for him. But you are correct", "NTA. You have different ideas of what a vacation should be. Maybe explain to them a little bit more about how you plan to travel. \n\nI like travelling on my own (Don't tell my husband that.)  Travelling with more people ties you down. You spend far too much time discussing what to do and trying to get everyone to agree. The really great thing about travelling around the world alone is that it is easy to meet and talk to people. You spend more time with locals as opposed to sticking with the same few people that you already know well (perhaps too well) from home. \n\nPerhaps you could compromise and go on a very short beach type vacation, such as 5 days in a resort, with your sibs before you take off for your own grand adventure. There are so many fabulous places in the world to see. Some people are tourists, others are travelers. Your sibs are the former, you are the latter.\n\nEnjoy your adventure!", "NTA - there is nothing that will ruin a vacation faster than inviting someone along that doesn't like the same things as you.  If you had invited your siblings on your trip, they would have had equal input on the adventure and made it a \"not-so-once-in-a-lifetime\" dream because they would have steered the trip their way 2/3rd of the time.    \n\n\nTheir \"hurt and disappointment\" is a form of emotional jealousy or control.  You're a grown 30 YO man.  You're allowed to take a holiday without your siblings permission.  Nip this behavior in the bud now and set clearer and better boundaries with them - letting them know that they don't get to dictate how your spend your money or where you vacation.  \n\n\nIf you don't set up clear boundaries now, your future spouse is going to have to deal with their manipulative tactics.  Tell them to get over themselves.  \n\nAnd honestly, if they weren't happy for you, for fulfilling this dream, you need to ask them why not?  All they heard was, \"I missed out.\"  Not, \"look how happy he was.\"  Which is the epitome of selfish.", "Do what gives you pleasure and memories.  You can include or exclude who you wish.

I got used to it, and learned to love seeing new places.\n\nI continued my travel adventures during and after college and each decade afterwards.

You're meant to spend it however you want. \n\nHow do their loans and career investment make shared memories for the three of you? Op, is it possible they're pissed that you're spending your portion of the cash on a trip...and you're not including them in your spend? Are they angling for a free vacation from you? Or are they saying they would have freely spent that sum of money on the trip. \n\nEither they wanted you to eat the cost of their trip.

So they spent the money on themselves, and now they're angry you're not spending YOUR money on them too???", "That just made it a \"Oh hell No!\" NTA, they want to have fun on your dime and probably change the itinerary every time they feel like it .. It would not be your journey of a lifetime anymore, and that you will always regret.

That take benefits them. \n\nBut you know that that is not what they wanted. You know that because you got those fixed assets as a reward for taking care of them. They cared enough for you to ensure you had the means to take care of yourself. \n\nIf your grandparents had wanted the money to be a shared asset to make family memories, they would have set up a separate pool of money to be used as a family memories fund. They did not do that though. Instead, They gave each of you a separate sum.", "[removed]", "Exactly.", "This was literally the first thought I had. Did they really expect to go on an extravagant vacation on OP's dime?", "OP it isn't up to you to 'fix it' with your family.  It's up to the people who started the actual problem - your siblings.  THEY have to apologize.", "Are they including you in their decisions? Tell them you think it's selfish to invest in their business or pay off their debt as it doesn't benefit or include you.

This got canceled, Im in a bad mood and unwilling to change and do something else. I don't like this food, why are we eating here?\" Go do your best trip.

NTA", "NTA.  This is your dream.  Your siblings have a different idea of a dream vacation and would probably start complaining on day three because you weren't sunning on the beach, destroying the entire experience for you.  Tell them this is just for you, like getting out of debt and furthering their careers is just for them and not something you can share as family.  They may be frosty for a while, but I'll wager two years from now they will be asking why you wasted your money on a bunch of sightseeing.", "NTA and have a fabulous time!!!", "They spent theirs the way they saw fit, have fun on your vacation and don\u2019t worry about them.", "INFO: were your siblings expecting you to pay for them to come with you?? If so, their behaviour is very strange.
