My husband works 40-45 hours a week.\n\nEvery morning we get up early and I feed my toddler and allow her to watch some learning shows while I do morning chores and make breakfast. I do laundry including washing and folding, clean up the rooms we are using, chop wood, clean the fireplace, shop once a week, plan meals, feed our cats and handle any kind of other tasks such as doctor's appointments, contracting work, etc. I also clean the kitchen in the afternoon because my daughter has a tendency to throw food on the floor regularly. At night I make two dinners, clean up my cooking mess, clean up her toys and her messes, get her ready for her bath, then put her to bed. I also clean the bathrooms and vacuum about once a week. My husband and I take turns giving her baths because some days I'm just too tired.\n\nIt's my husband's job to do dishes and wipe down the counters each night. Once a week he takes out the garbage, cleans the litter boxes and takes everything to the curb. He does the litter boxes about once a week otherwise. He also makes dinner about twice a week.\n\nWe recently bought a house that needs some work, so on the weekends he takes our daughter out with him to do the rest of the shopping or errands while I stay at home and work on the house. It's a slow process because we don't have any help from family or friends. There are no preschools or daycares that are open in my area.\n\nThe problem is that my husband typically falls asleep right after dinner, and usually refuses to get up until about midnight, or until I wake him up. This is a huge issue for me because not only does it mean that we don't spend any time together during the evenings, but also if I don't wake him up nothing gets done. He's always been like this, but before we had a kid I didn't really care. Now it's a different story. I just cannot handle having to do his share on top of everything else. I'm also really sick of having to worry about it and constantly waking him.\n\nI've tried talking to him, I've gotten angry, I've told him to set an alarm so I don't have to worry about him sleeping, I've told him to do the dishes right after dinner. He'll change things for a week or so, but then go back.\n\nA few days ago I came out to go to the bathroom at 2am and realized he was sleeping on the couch, nothing had been done. I lost it and screamed at him that if he didn't quit falling asleep after dinner, I was going to drop our toddler off at his job in the middle of the day. He got really angry and then did his chores. We have avoided each other since then.\n\nMy parents say that I should let it go because he works hard, but so do I. However, I don't think that he really deserved me screaming or threatening him despite his actions and I should have handled it differently.\n\nAITA for threatening him?\n\nEDITED TO ADD: So I don't have to continually repeat myself, **I cannot find any daycare for my daughter in my area, everything is a year or more waitlist. If I can't get daycare, I cannot work outside the home.** I'm not sure what that has to do with my post at all, because I don't really think it would change anything. Some of you seem to think that because I'm a stay at home mom that somehow I'm asking for misery, or that I should do *all of the work* without complaint. It's 2023 (almost) and that's not how most marriages work. That's not how my marriage has ever worked, nor is it going to. I would not have married him if we didn't have an *egalitarian marriage*.

It's challenging.\n\nThe point here isn't who the asshole is. It's whether you guys can pull it together and row the boat in the same direction or not.", "I think the way both of you are communicating with each other is complete AH behavior. It\u2019s a low to threaten your husband using your child and his employment (which I\u2019m assuming is also your family\u2019s only income). Whether or not you meant it, it\u2019s completely unacceptable. I understand how burnt out you must be being at home all the time especially with a young child, but I think communicating with him to understand why he isn\u2019t able to be more present after work hours is vital. Is there something going on at work that absolutely drains him and stresses him out so he becomes absent as soon as he leaves? Is he going through any personal hardships? It may help to ask these questions and even consult with a marriage counselor as they can be a great mediator for conversation like these!", "Probably NAH.\n\nI think your husband might have some medical issues. If he ALWAYS falls asleep after dinner, there are a couple of conditions he should be checked for. You might have noticed some symptoms.\n\n1. Sleep apnea. Does he snore a lot? Does he sometimes stop breathing only to take a large breath some seconds later? Checking for sleep apnea is super easy. He just needs to sleep with this little device strapped to him with some wires and tubes in his nose. (Like one of those oxygen tubes). **Edit:** *He only has to sleep with that device one night. That gathers enough info to figure out if he need a CPAP or something.*\n2. Diabetes. Doesn't matter if it's type 1 or 2 for diagnosis. Does he pee a lot? Does he drink maybe a little more water than expected? Drinking lots of water is not necessarily a sign that he's taking good care of himself, but it's to replace all the water in his system lost when he goes to pee out a bunch of sugar! The blood test is easy. Have him drink a bunch of juice before and have them do both normal tests for glucose levels. HbA1c (basically an average of glucose levels over three months) and the normal standard glucose test. It's one single needle prick to the finger, normal glucose test takes one second, the HbA1c takes a little longer, but not, like, a day. Usually they do this at every doctor's office, you don't need to go to a specialist.\n3. ADD. One of the symptoms is that you have a hard time getting started with things you don't like. So you put it off. And then you put it off. And then you fall asleep or start doing something else and you've forgotten all about it. And then it never gets done, even if you mean to do it. The ADD/ADHD brain is a very noisy place. There's always some distraction that your brain likes more than doing chores or listening in meetings or write that report.\n\nI know you get frustrated, but please don't wake your husband with a screaming fight in the middle of the night. As I said, there probably aren't any assholes here, and he might need help.", "You\u2019re not TA for wanting more help from your husband, but YTA for using your toddler to threaten him", "ESH - You for a threat that's not going to get you what you want. And him - 40-45 hours is a normal work week. Does his job involve difficult physical labor? Or Are perhaps he has blood sugar issues, and can't help himself from falling asleep? If not and he's just being lazy, stubborn, and selfish then perhaps try marital counseling? But both parties have to make an effort for a relationship to succeed  and your hubby doesn't seem to be trying. I hope you can figure something out, because otherwise I'm not sure how your relationship will survive.", "Idt this is an issue of who is or isn't TA. It's just that you have a husband showing you every evening where you are in his priorities. Believe him. If he can't be bothered to stay awake for 30minutes to do what he is supposed to do despite your repeated requests, then maybe you should do what you need to do to ensure your sanity and take a break yourself. Go to bed early. Let him make his own dinners. Sleep in and let him be responsible for the kiddo in the morning. People can only treat you the way you let them", "Info: do you want your husband to get fired?", "Hun, you are burnt out. You reacted that way because you're exhausted and frustrated. You NEED this man to step up like yesterday. NTA but I think both of you would benefit from A) counseling and B) a weekend away from grinding. He needs to appreciate what all you do, and you need a damn break!", "ESH. He needs to learn to manage his exhaustion at the end of the day. You shouldn\u2019t have resorted to an empty threat to get him to get it together.", "Thing is, if you act like his mom? He'll keep acting like a child?\n\nNTA. But, having the occasional tantrum when you've just had it with his crap isn't actually working for you. So, try something new. Anything. Leave him asleep on the couch and with his chores undone and wake him up early the next mornings so he can take care of business. Anything untried has small potential to be a game changer for you? \n\nNegotiating and reminding don't reset him. So, make some new suggestions, (like hiring a cleaning service to help you manage, or sending the laundry out to be cleaned.)

If he is always tired even before your child was born, I wonder if something else like sleep apnea is at play.", "hm, 40-45 hours a week is basically a standard work week, nothing crazy. is his job especially stressfull or something along those lines? yeah, I get we are all tired when we get back from work, but falling asleep everyday after one gets home sounds like maybe some helath issues? or just lazyness, especially if you two have a child that needs to be taken care of. I would say NTA for your frustration, but maybe a soft YTA for blowing up like that.", "Is it possible that your husband has some sleeping disorder? It seems so odd that he is constantly falling asleep before it is time for bed.\nIf he snores than he should probably get tested for sleep apnea.", "NTA, with that said, we all know screaming rarely changes anything. You guys need to sit down and have a serious and civil conversation. While he\u2019s using his 40-45 hr work as an excuse to shirk his home responsibilities, he is missing the fact that you\u2019re working a minimum of 100 hr weeks depending on what time you\u2019re getting up in the morning and how you\u2019re splitting responsibilities on the weekends.", "NTA, maybe not the ideal reply, and you probably know that actually following through would be a bad move in this case, but he has rejected your attempts at actual constructive conversation.

Does he have other health issues?  \n\nMy extremely fit, very healthy seeming husband started doing this a few years ago.
