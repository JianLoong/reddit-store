I'd expand, but your post clearly spells out why. - maybe see if there's a councilor at the medical facilities that could maybe talk with her... maybe she really doesn't understand, and an unbiased 3rd party could properly explain it... if she's willing to learn, grow, and mature... we're all human and deserve a chance to better ourselves... however, if she's leaning towards this being a hill to die on... imo, that's a major flag/deal breaker. \n\n~ You only have so much of yourself you can spread around. Dealing with the health issues trumps coddling her brused ego. Good luck. XOXO", "NTA\n\nI get that that\u2019s rough for her, but is nothing in comparison to what alzheimers is. I am so so sorry OP. You were in the right here, when I go visit my family members, it is a heart wrench to be called by the wrong name at times, but it is better to be with them than to be mad at the trivial things that are beyond their control.", "NTA. I am so sorry your family is going through this disease. Does your girlfriend understand the disease and how it affects short-term/more recent memories first? \n\nIf she does understand the disease then I question her ability to have empathy. This is only going to get harder and you will need supportive people around you. I have a parent with progressive dementia and know how important a support group is for everyone involved.", "NTA - she needs to recognize that with Alzheimer\u2019s sometimes you just have to go with the flow.

And you can\u2019t constantly apologize for everything your father does.", "NTA  \nEither she is self-centered and childish or ignorant of the realities of Alzheimer's. Either way you need to have some serious discussions with her. You need someone who can support you with this, not someone who makes your difficult situation about herself.", "NTA she needs to get over herself your dad is sick", "NTA. I recommend getting the book \u201cStill Alice\u201d (please read the book, the movie doesn\u2019t do it Justice AT ALL) for your partner and having her read it.

Big red flag that she feels entitled to anything here.", "Completely NTA. Your dad has a medical condition.

Your girlfriend should be apologizing for getting mad and jealous.", "If she's going to be sticking around she better get used to it, sorry for your family op", "Here is the real kicker-  if anything else has their identity confided, you better not try to redirect Dad.

My grandfather thought I was my aunt. It was hard for me but it was easier on him than explaining who I was when he was confused.", "NTA. She has a lot to learn about Alzheimer\u2019s.", "Absolutely not NTA.   My lovely fil died last year from this.  He forgot people.  It hurt.  But he had no choice no control.   Tell g.f.  she can still have a relationship with him if she wants, but one day he may even think she's his sister or aunt.", "No.\n\nThat seems pretty insecure in my book.", "NTA. I lost my dad to Alzheimer\u2019s last year. She\u2019s got a lot to learn about the disease.", "NTA. Alzheimer\u2019s is a cruel disease and unless you\u2019re in the trenches, it\u2019s often difficult to understand the choices family members make about which battles to fight as their loved one\u2019s memory fails. \n\nI once watched as my mother looked right at me and asked where her daughter went.  I\u2019m her daughter\u2026and the fear and confusion on her face as she looked around the table and suddenly didn\u2019t recognize any of us was heartbreaking.  \n\nI also sat with my MIL as she was recovering from a fall and couldn\u2019t be left alone. She asked me where my FIL was.  I would gently explain that he had passed two years before. And she would ask again 10 minutes later.  She couldn\u2019t understand why he wasn\u2019t there with her.  For two hours, until she fell asleep, she\u2019d ask every 10-15 minutes and I would have to explain. It was brutal. \n\nIf this is a serious relationship, you may want to have her talk with someone knowledgeable about the progression of dementia so that she can understand that it\u2019s not personal. This is not a battle where anyone wins and can only result in confusion and pain.  \n\nYou have my sympathy for the difficult path you\u2019re on.  May you find peace in your memories of better times and the strength to give your father peace during this time.", "NTA\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s sucks. Watching someone you love go through that sucks. Just\u2026 so much. I\u2019m genuinely sorry, OP \ud83d\ude1e.\n\nHe\u2019s not being malicious, he\u2019s suffering from a disease that steals everything from him slowly. Why would she expect you to be mad at him for something he\u2019s not doing intentionally and that he can\u2019t help. She sounds incredible insecure and horrifyingly insensitive to what your dad, you, and your family are going through.", "NTA - He has Alzheimer's. He doesn't know. Your gf is the unreasonable and insecure one in this situation.", "NTA- It's sad that she is worried about herself at a time when you are hurting for your father. She should know that she is important enough to you.", "Nope, nope, nope!\n\nAnd FUCK DEMENTIA!\n\nYour girlfriend needs to do some proper research about dementia - especially early onset dementia. This sounds like someone who believes dementia is just a memory issue when it's so much more than that.\n\nNTA", "NTA - I understand why it would be upsetting for her to be called the ex gf's name, but Alzheimers is brutal, and early onset is especially so, given how much faster it seems to progress.\n\nYour gf needs to suck it up and deal with it.  It's not going to be long before your Dad doesn't know anyone, let alone her.", "NTA your girlfriend should get over this. Your dad has Alzheimer's it hard for him to remember new name he don't do it to make your girlfriend mad.", "NTA. You have nothing to apologise for. Your dad didn't mean it. You didn't say it. Your girlfriend feels hurt, I would too. \n\nBut sometimes in life things happen and they are nobody's fault. You have to learn that sometimes you will be hurt and there is no one to blame. \n\nThe fact that she's holding you accountable for her hurt, even though it's not your fault? It doesn't speak well to her being an understanding and compassionate person. \n\nIf your girlfriend thinks you're responsible for apologising every time your dad upsets her? It's time she stops going to see your dad. You don't need her insisting that you're wrong because you exist in relation to your dad, and if she can't deal with being called by the wrong name by an *Alzheimer's patient*? She isn't going to cope when things get worse and he gets more confused. For the safety and happiness of you, your girlfriend, and *especially* your dad, she shouldn't see him.", "I\u2019ve seen a handful of people through the end of life stages of cancer, and while that is a VERY different nightmare, there is one similarity - as things progress, names start slipping. People get mixed up. Misnaming and confusion are going to happen.\n\nYour girlfriend is fortunate to not have experienced this yet, but the lack of compassion is a big problem. She should be supporting you through this. Her inability to separate her need for recognition/attention from the reality of the situation and approach the situation rationally is beyond troubling. She is absolutely entitled to feel sad over the mix-up, but she could have voiced that later on in a more appropriate manner, and it should never have come with an expectation of apology. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA. Keep being there for your father, and please seek out support groups for people in your position. Building a community is the best thing you can do for yourself right now. This isn\u2019t something anyone should have to experience alone, but you *really* shouldn\u2019t have to experience it with *her*.", "NTA, \n\nAlzheimer's can be devastating for everyone involved. It's not your girlfriend's fault either that she doesn't know how the disease works. Be patient and try to explain the situation to her.", "NTA. My grandfather suffered from Alzheimer's and would constantly mistake me for my much younger cousin. I am so sorry your family has to deal with this, but you are not even CLOSE to being an AH in this at all.", "NTA\nMy FIL has dementia...  He calls me by his daughters name, it could take him a few minites to get my name or sometimes he doesn't remember who I am at all for a lot of rhe interaction. When he does remember it's fine,  when he doesn't remember,  that's fine too.  His brain literally isn't working properly.  Your gf needs to get over heself or stop visiting altogether.", "NTA he has Alzheimer's and it's hard enough for you to see him going through this and slowly forgetting things\n\nNo need to correct him I can understand how repetitive it is for you and difficult to handle with", "Yes, my great grandmother had Alzheimer's and she would forget who people were or get them mixed up. She even called my grandmother \"mom\" sometimes and this would just devastate my grandmother, but she never got upset with her, just kept talking to her as if nothing happened.", "I like this reply. I was quick to judge the girlfriend and assume she\u2019s a vapid narcissist but maybe she truly doesn\u2019t understand. Maybe jealousy is clouding her judgement? Good idea about the 3rd party explaining it", "NTA. My Grandma passed from this and the wrong name is getting of LIGHTLY. (She was violent for a very brief period of time). I\u2019d look at it as a positive, it showed your girlfriend\u2019s tire colors, Dad\u2019s still looking out for you!", "Or both.", "I've heard this book recommended by so many people whose loved ones have Alzheimer's. If your girlfriend really cares about you, she will make an effort to learn. My Dad forgot his wife's name, called her by my name, called his son by his grandsons name, etc etc. We all do better in this life if we try not to take offense as much as possible.", "My paternal grandma often thought I was my mom, cause sometimes it would just be myself and my dad visiting and we\u2019re pretty sure she wasn\u2019t aware what decade it was"]}
