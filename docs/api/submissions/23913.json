She should be supporting you through this. Her inability to separate her need for recognition/attention from the reality of the situation and approach the situation rationally is beyond troubling.

My mom has young onset dementia as well (either FTD or LBD or mixed - not Alz) and it's fucking brutal. Mom only occasionally recognises me, the oldest daughter, and rarely my younger brother.\n\nIf you want to stay with her, definitely get her some education. The Alzheimers Association has great resources, and a 24/7 hotline where you can talk to one of their trained experts for advice and resources.\n\nPersonally, I'd approach this with her compassionately and honestly. The Alz means that your dad will never know who she is. He can't make these kinds of memories anymore because his brain is turning to Swiss cheese. But, the fact that he called her by your exes name is, even though it's painful for her, shows that dad knows that she's important to you and, especially if he got along with the ex, feels positive emotions when she comes to visit with you. It's a sign dad likes her, and over time he'll even forget the ex's name, so this is temporary.\n\nIf she can't deal, and won't work to understand, then you need to let her go. Things only get worse from here, and you don't need to be dealing with the extra stress of managing a healthy adult's emotions on top of dealing with your own ambiguous loss and grieving process.\n\nAll my love to you OP. This shit sucks.", "An early memory of mine is great grandma who had dementia. She thought my grandpa was her brother, my dad was her son. But when she would see my brother and I, it clicked that she had the wrong people in mind. We were her great grand children, my dad was her grandson and our grandfather was her son. She'd be a little more lucid for a bit, and that was a mixed blessing as she'd also realize how far gone her mind was, but she'd forget again. We also couldn't stay long, the repeated realization from her remembering, forgetting, and remembering again was hard on everyone.", "Just for anyone reading, you should never tell a person with dementia someone important has died, they don't remember and each time you tell them, if they understand, is like hearing it for the first time. Instead you should tell a white lie (He's visiting his mom, he's at work, etc etc) and redirect. They're communicating fear and loneliness, and addressing that is what will soothe them in the moment. \n\nI recommend checking out the nursing educator Teepa Snow on Tik Tok or YouTube, she give amazing advice on how to communicate with and give care to people with dementia while respecting their dignity. It makes things easier for both the relative/care giver and the person with dementia. \n\nI am 100% not judging you OP - this shit is hard and no one bothers to educate caregivers - but this is the advice I got from my ex-MiL who is a gerontological nursing expert and it works . \n\nMy mom has young onset FTD or LBD (or mixed dementia, we don't have a proper dx but she requires 24/7 memory care) and my brother made the mistake of telling her the truth about us renting her condo to a nice woman \n to help pay for her care, and that turned into a full blown delusion that my brother stole her apartment to run a brothel out of. Months of her perservating on that cope and increasing her agitation, which led to having to be put on antipsychotics and hastened her decline.\n\nIf I was able to call, when she was like this, I'd say something like I would tell her \"Wow! That doesn't sound like something my brother would do, but I understand why you're worried. You spent so much time decorating your home and taking care of your garden, and it's such a nice and cozy place. When we're done talking, I'm going to call a friend who lives nearby to check on your house to make sure everything is okay after we get off the phone.\"\n\nThen every time she brought it up in the conversation, I'd agree that sounded bad but I was going to check up on her house. In the next conversation if she brought it up again, I'd tell her my friend checked like I promised and everything looked good, but I can have my friend check again. Then I'd redirect her to talk about her plants or something about how nice her place was. \n\nOf course, I never asked anyone to do anything, but being taken seriously and addressing the emotional component calmed her down very quickly. If my brother never told her, this would never have distressed her so much. \n\nThis is stuff I wish I knew from the beginning, hope it helps someone else.", "Very much NTA. Your gf's reaction does not make her look very good. If she does not know how this illness works then you should educate her, but if she still refuses to understand then I'd seriously consider whether you should continue the relationship at all.  Very immature of her.", "I\u2019d encourage you to bring GF to a local dementia support group where she can get a better understanding of the disease process. If refuses to go or she\u2019s still being a stickler about this after, she needs to get a grip or get packing. Unfortunately calling someone by the wrong name is extremely mild when it comes to dementia, and if she can\u2019t learn to understand this she\u2019s going to be a nightmare if he ever becomes graphic in his language or starts undressing at inappropriate times (two *very* common behaviors.) \n\nI\u2019m so sorry your dad and family are having to go through this.

She had taken a bad fall just 2-3 weeks earlier and was in rehab care. Prior to her fall, she was fully aware that her husband had passed, so these questions of hers were unexpected.  Her responses, at the time, were not ones full of fear and upset, but seemed born out of confusion related to her fall.  By the time she woke up the next morning, she was back to remembering her husband had passed.   If I had lied to her at that time, given the circumstances, that would not have respected her dignity and would have created a different set of issues as my MIL always responded better to truths than deflections in the years after her dementia became apparent.  \n\nWe were already hip deep in dealing with my mother\u2019s dementia at the time of my MIL\u2019s fall, so we\u2019re well aware of deflection techniques, but given the circumstances at the time, I would still make the decision to explain to my MIL each and every time the truth as given the time was early evening, any other explanation would have been more upsetting to her. He would never have left her alone in a hospital type bed during the evening hours for any reason and she was cognizant enough to know this.  For her, it was an explanation that made sense.  She just simply forgot within minutes. The only person it was brutal for was me as I was very close to my in-laws and my FIL had been my father figure for 25 years before he passed.  As time passed and her dementia became apparent, we did use deflection and redirection techniques, as we did with my mother.  \n\nI believe everyone should use their own judgement as the disease progresses. Yes, absolutely educate yourself about the disease and what you can do to make this time easier for all involved.  But you should also be aware of the individuality of each person and that dementia is not a one size fits all disease and the way families deal with the progression should be tailored to that.  Some become quiet and withdrawn, some become combative and argumentative.  The techniques used in later stages of dementia might not be as effective in earlier stages.  And the techniques that work with one individual don\u2019t always work with another.  Having experienced the progression of dementia with three different aging parents, I know first hand that there are no cookie-cutter strategies for this.  With my FIL, we had to use a combination of deflection and reassurance while occasionally having to deal with combativeness or confusion induced panic.  With my mother, we had to utilize deflection frequently as she tended to create scenarios that never happened in her mind and would become combative and accusatory.  With my MIL, she was quiet and withdrawn but seemed to instinctively know when we were deflecting and that was more upsetting to her than the truth.  We just learned what would trigger certain questions and avoided those triggers.", "NTA. Your dad literally can't help it. Educate her about Alzheimer's if she doesn't understand it well.

And he was very understanding when she did it, eventually she did start to get his name right, but my partner was never rude, and never corrected her on the spot as to not embarrass her, but we'd call him by his name in front of her and if she forgot the name wed say his correct name.", "My father in law does the same thing with my daughter.

There's absolutely nothing to apologize for. Your dad has been dealt a terrible, cruel hand, and mistakes like this are common. It's not his fault, nor is it yours, and you shouldn't have to apologize for your father being sick. Your girlfriend needs to learn a little empathy, and some maturity.

Maybe she's just the wrong girl. \n\nEveryone knows Alzheimer's and what it can do to a person and their families, what it takes from them.

She should do some heavy reading into these disease processes and do the apologizing herself.", "NTA\n\nMaybe this is just my interpretation and how I've made such behaviour sit with me, because my grandmother has Alzheimer's as well. I spent a long time caring for her with my Grandfather, and as her condition deteriorated, she started to call me by his name.  It bothers me because my grandfather is her husband. But to me, she called me that because I was caring for her as he was, and thus anyone that cared for her must have his name.\n\nIt could be that he associates your ex's with someone you care about and who cares about you. Since your ex is an older (and probably more fixed) memory than your current partner, and you care about your current partner and your current partner cares about you, he's made that association with her too and assigned her that name accordingly.  It's not a slight on his part, it's not that he is saying your ex was better for you than your current partner is.  He recognises your current partner as someone you love and who loves you, and his memory is going \"Oh, she must be {ex's name}\".\n\nWhere you can, being as respectful as possible, correct him.  If only because it may reinforce memories he is developing now.  Maybe, I don't know, it might not do anything.  But it's not his fault, and you know it's not his fault, and unfortunately that memory is going to disappear soon.  It is going to be a horrible road to go down, and I wish you the best.  But you are not the AH here, and neither is he.  Your partner needs to understand this, because there may be a point where you will really need her to be there for you, and if she can't then she needs to leave, for both of your sakes.", "Salam!\n\nI\u2019m going to be straightforward with you, she sounds Awful! The points you made were (no pun intended) on point and you weren\u2019t even rude to her by the sounds of it.

Please cherish your dad, you never know when that moment will come that your name would be forgotten and even your relationship to him.

It\u2019s even harder for your grandpa who doesn\u2019t know her and will most likely never recognize her.  She could make him nervous.   She needs to not take it personal.

My rule of thumb when I was out with her - \u201cwhat would you do if it was a 5-year old?\u201d   It\u2019s that sad and difficult.
