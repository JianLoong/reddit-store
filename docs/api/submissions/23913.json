I lost my dad to Alzheimer\u2019s last year. She\u2019s got a lot to learn about the disease.", "NTA. Alzheimer\u2019s is a cruel disease and unless you\u2019re in the trenches, it\u2019s often difficult to understand the choices family members make about which battles to fight as their loved one\u2019s memory fails. \n\nI once watched as my mother looked right at me and asked where her daughter went.  I\u2019m her daughter\u2026and the fear and confusion on her face as she looked around the table and suddenly didn\u2019t recognize any of us was heartbreaking.  \n\nI also sat with my MIL as she was recovering from a fall and couldn\u2019t be left alone. She asked me where my FIL was.  I would gently explain that he had passed two years before. And she would ask again 10 minutes later.  She couldn\u2019t understand why he wasn\u2019t there with her.  For two hours, until she fell asleep, she\u2019d ask every 10-15 minutes and I would have to explain. It was brutal. \n\nIf this is a serious relationship, you may want to have her talk with someone knowledgeable about the progression of dementia so that she can understand that it\u2019s not personal. This is not a battle where anyone wins and can only result in confusion and pain.  \n\nYou have my sympathy for the difficult path you\u2019re on.

You have to learn that sometimes you will be hurt and there is no one to blame. \n\nThe fact that she's holding you accountable for her hurt, even though it's not your fault? It doesn't speak well to her being an understanding and compassionate person. \n\nIf your girlfriend thinks you're responsible for apologising every time your dad upsets her? It's time she stops going to see your dad. You don't need her insisting that you're wrong because you exist in relation to your dad, and if she can't deal with being called by the wrong name by an *Alzheimer's patient*?

People get mixed up. Misnaming and confusion are going to happen.\n\nYour girlfriend is fortunate to not have experienced this yet, but the lack of compassion is a big problem. She should be supporting you through this. Her inability to separate her need for recognition/attention from the reality of the situation and approach the situation rationally is beyond troubling. She is absolutely entitled to feel sad over the mix-up, but she could have voiced that later on in a more appropriate manner, and it should never have come with an expectation of apology. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA. Keep being there for your father, and please seek out support groups for people in your position. Building a community is the best thing you can do for yourself right now.

She even called my grandmother \"mom\" sometimes and this would just devastate my grandmother, but she never got upset with her, just kept talking to her as if nothing happened.", "I like this reply.

My mom has young onset dementia as well (either FTD or LBD or mixed - not Alz) and it's fucking brutal. Mom only occasionally recognises me, the oldest daughter, and rarely my younger brother.\n\nIf you want to stay with her, definitely get her some education. The Alzheimers Association has great resources, and a 24/7 hotline where you can talk to one of their trained experts for advice and resources.\n\nPersonally, I'd approach this with her compassionately and honestly. The Alz means that your dad will never know who she is. He can't make these kinds of memories anymore because his brain is turning to Swiss cheese. But, the fact that he called her by your exes name is, even though it's painful for her, shows that dad knows that she's important to you and, especially if he got along with the ex, feels positive emotions when she comes to visit with you. It's a sign dad likes her, and over time he'll even forget the ex's name, so this is temporary.\n\nIf she can't deal, and won't work to understand, then you need to let her go. Things only get worse from here, and you don't need to be dealing with the extra stress of managing a healthy adult's emotions on top of dealing with your own ambiguous loss and grieving process.\n\nAll my love to you OP. This shit sucks.", "An early memory of mine is great grandma who had dementia. She thought my grandpa was her brother, my dad was her son. But when she would see my brother and I, it clicked that she had the wrong people in mind. We were her great grand children, my dad was her grandson and our grandfather was her son. She'd be a little more lucid for a bit, and that was a mixed blessing as she'd also realize how far gone her mind was, but she'd forget again. We also couldn't stay long, the repeated realization from her remembering, forgetting, and remembering again was hard on everyone.", "Just for anyone reading, you should never tell a person with dementia someone important has died, they don't remember and each time you tell them, if they understand, is like hearing it for the first time. Instead you should tell a white lie (He's visiting his mom, he's at work, etc etc) and redirect. They're communicating fear and loneliness, and addressing that is what will soothe them in the moment. \n\nI recommend checking out the nursing educator Teepa Snow on Tik Tok or YouTube, she give amazing advice on how to communicate with and give care to people with dementia while respecting their dignity. It makes things easier for both the relative/care giver and the person with dementia. \n\nI am 100% not judging you OP - this shit is hard and no one bothers to educate caregivers - but this is the advice I got from my ex-MiL who is a gerontological nursing expert and it works . \n\nMy mom has young onset FTD or LBD (or mixed dementia, we don't have a proper dx but she requires 24/7 memory care) and my brother made the mistake of telling her the truth about us renting her condo to a nice woman \n to help pay for her care, and that turned into a full blown delusion that my brother stole her apartment to run a brothel out of. Months of her perservating on that cope and increasing her agitation, which led to having to be put on antipsychotics and hastened her decline.\n\nIf I was able to call, when she was like this, I'd say something like I would tell her \"Wow! That doesn't sound like something my brother would do, but I understand why you're worried. You spent so much time decorating your home and taking care of your garden, and it's such a nice and cozy place. When we're done talking, I'm going to call a friend who lives nearby to check on your house to make sure everything is okay after we get off the phone.\"\n\nThen every time she brought it up in the conversation, I'd agree that sounded bad but I was going to check up on her house. In the next conversation if she brought it up again, I'd tell her my friend checked like I promised and everything looked good, but I can have my friend check again. Then I'd redirect her to talk about her plants or something about how nice her place was. \n\nOf course, I never asked anyone to do anything, but being taken seriously and addressing the emotional component calmed her down very quickly. If my brother never told her, this would never have distressed her so much. \n\nThis is stuff I wish I knew from the beginning, hope it helps someone else.", "Very much NTA. Your gf's reaction does not make her look very good. If she does not know how this illness works then you should educate her, but if she still refuses to understand then I'd seriously consider whether you should continue the relationship at all.  Very immature of her.", "I\u2019d encourage you to bring GF to a local dementia support group where she can get a better understanding of the disease process. If refuses to go or she\u2019s still being a stickler about this after, she needs to get a grip or get packing. Unfortunately calling someone by the wrong name is extremely mild when it comes to dementia, and if she can\u2019t learn to understand this she\u2019s going to be a nightmare if he ever becomes graphic in his language or starts undressing at inappropriate times (two *very* common behaviors.) \n\nI\u2019m so sorry your dad and family are having to go through this. Dementia is such a bitch of a disease.", "Nta. When my husband\u2019s grandmother with dementia called me by his ex wife\u2019s name, I just rolled with it.

When my FIL (80M) calls me by a different name, we know that he\u2019s getting ill and probably has some sort of infection that hasn\u2019t surfaced properly yet. It\u2019s not his fault, he\u2019s very old and unwell so we make a joke about the name he calls me and check up on him frequently. Once he\u2019s better, we tease him and he says he doesn\u2019t know why he calls me that name (he usually can\u2019t remember what happens during the time he\u2019s sick). \n\nGf needs to deal with it and realise it\u2019s not anything personal", "There are YouTube videos about how to interact with people with AZD/dementia, That could be a good start cuz in might be hard to find a staff person at the hospital who has the time.", "This is the way. GF just needs to be educated", "I lost my grandmother to Alzheimer\u2019s when I was in high school and I couldn\u2019t even get through the *trailer* for that movie. I\u2019m sure the book is an incredibly heartbreaking journey.", "what in the actual fuck are you talking about? like did you even bother to read the post?", "While I mostly agree with you, for the record, at the time, we did not know she was in the earliest stages of dementia or I might have redirected. She had taken a bad fall just 2-3 weeks earlier and was in rehab care. Prior to her fall, she was fully aware that her husband had passed, so these questions of hers were unexpected.  Her responses, at the time, were not ones full of fear and upset, but seemed born out of confusion related to her fall.  By the time she woke up the next morning, she was back to remembering her husband had passed.   If I had lied to her at that time, given the circumstances, that would not have respected her dignity and would have created a different set of issues as my MIL always responded better to truths than deflections in the years after her dementia became apparent.  \n\nWe were already hip deep in dealing with my mother\u2019s dementia at the time of my MIL\u2019s fall, so we\u2019re well aware of deflection techniques, but given the circumstances at the time, I would still make the decision to explain to my MIL each and every time the truth as given the time was early evening, any other explanation would have been more upsetting to her. He would never have left her alone in a hospital type bed during the evening hours for any reason and she was cognizant enough to know this.  For her, it was an explanation that made sense.  She just simply forgot within minutes. The only person it was brutal for was me as I was very close to my in-laws and my FIL had been my father figure for 25 years before he passed.  As time passed and her dementia became apparent, we did use deflection and redirection techniques, as we did with my mother.  \n\nI believe everyone should use their own judgement as the disease progresses. Yes, absolutely educate yourself about the disease and what you can do to make this time easier for all involved.  But you should also be aware of the individuality of each person and that dementia is not a one size fits all disease and the way families deal with the progression should be tailored to that.  Some become quiet and withdrawn, some become combative and argumentative.  The techniques used in later stages of dementia might not be as effective in earlier stages.  And the techniques that work with one individual don\u2019t always work with another.  Having experienced the progression of dementia with three different aging parents, I know first hand that there are no cookie-cutter strategies for this.  With my FIL, we had to use a combination of deflection and reassurance while occasionally having to deal with combativeness or confusion induced panic.  With my mother, we had to utilize deflection frequently as she tended to create scenarios that never happened in her mind and would become combative and accusatory.  With my MIL, she was quiet and withdrawn but seemed to instinctively know when we were deflecting and that was more upsetting to her than the truth.  We just learned what would trigger certain questions and avoided those triggers."]}
