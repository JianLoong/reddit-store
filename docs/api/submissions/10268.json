I've been wearing a wig since I was 16 because people are mean, rude, treat you with pity, and are disrespectful (on purpose or not). When I was 15 I once had a grown-ass woman stop her car in the middle of the road and yell at me \"Do you have cancer?\" My friend and I couldn't believe it lol.   \nThough I was with that same friend one day and she got super angry at a girl with hairy legs. She was all \"does she think we can't see she didn't shave? Who does she think she is??\".   \n\n\nIt's obviously anger about feeling you're obligated to shave and resenting someone who doesn't care/doesn't feel like they need to. The societal expectations regarding women and hair are shit and you shouldn't worry about any of it. Women expected to have long hair are among the reason why I was so bullied in school. Bullies also target women who don't shave, because whatever.  The only thing that matters is liking your body and doing what you feel like doing. It's not hurting anyone.", "NTA.

Now when he sees a woman who isn't shaved he said she looks weird. Growing hair is the signal that you are now a woman and not a child. There's nothing sexy about being shaved like a child and nothing gross for being a natural woman.

Up until last February, I would do the same thing, cut and drain at home. The issue with that is no matter how clean my home, myself, and whatever I had to cut open the cysts are in no way clean enough for at home surgery. Which is what I was and you were doing. \n\nTo make a very long story short, I had a cyst in my right pelvic region, picture where you place your leg in the leg hole in your underwear is. I sliced it open with a razor, drained it, patched it up as best I could and thought that was that. However, it continued to fill up and each time was more painful than the last, but I figured I wasn\u2019t doing a good enough job and kept messing with the damn thing.\n\nSo, about a week into me messing with this cyst several times a day, I\u2019d had a wellness visit with my pcp. At this point, I had been feeling like I got hit by a bus, running a fever, and starting to become delirious. I mentioned the cyst to my doc and as soon as she looked at it, she went white as a sheet. I\u2019ve been with my doc for over 17 years, so we\u2019re pretty close. Anyways, she tells me I need to get to a hospital immediately and she wanted to call me an ambulance right then and there. I told her my dad had driven me to her office and that he could drive me to the hospital instead. She made me swear I would go and that she was going to personally call the hospital and tell them to expect me and to call her when I got there (I have a bad habit of letting things get really bad before seeking help, so that\u2019s why she acted the way she did)\n\nI get to the hospital and I was immediately rushed to the icu. Shortly after that, I am being prepped for  emergency surgery to get rid of the infection. I had necrotizing fasciitis at that point, also known as flesh eating disease. They had to cut 70sq centimeters of dead and dying tissue out of my leg. I was in the hospital more than a week and I was unconscious for most of it because I was so sick. \n\nThe healing was BRUTAL, after being discharged I had to do my own packing changes, using a bleach/water solution, each and every day. It felt like my leg was on fire and being rubbed with sandpaper. It took months before I had completely healed. \n\nPlease OP, do not ever do any at home surgery ever again.
