You don\u2019t have to shave for anyone but yourself (if you want to, that is)\nAlso, I found this tip for razor bumps. EOS shave cream mixed with baby aloe vera. It does kinda clog your razor a bit more but it feels so much smoother and softer, and helps prevent razor bumps.", "NTA\n\nWtf is up with your mom?! She complains about the water bill (you don't shower too much if it's daily or every other day) but insists you shave?! This... needs water as well! \n\nAnd if it's not comfy for you (!), why should you do it? Because *she* does not want to see your hair? Again, WTF?!", "NTA. Shaving is a lot of work. Sometimes I just don\u2019t have the extra energy. I can go a couple of weeks before shaving. And I shave everything including my arms. Sometimes I\u2019ll shave my arms and armpits and not my legs. It\u2019s okay and completely normal to not shave every shower. Also for me shaving too much causes me to have bumps.", "NTA she needs to stop in at an all girl school. We were the hairiest teens I've ever encountered", "NTA tell your mom to mind her business", "NTA. You do not have to shave if you don\u2019t want to, even in the summer. People have hair. It\u2019s a fact of life. It\u2019s. A personal decision to remove it or not. I\u2019m sorry your mom is misogynistic but trust me, you are not TA for not shaving.", "NTA- your hair, your body, your choice. If you want to get rid of hair and avoid blades, try Nair or a similar product on legs and armpits.", "NTA . Body hair isn't gross. It's the body's natural state, and it has an evolutionary purpose. To example protecting the skin from friction. Shaving is actually unhealthy, because it causes small wounds, that allow bacteria to pass the natural skin barrier. \n\nAnd honestly, maybe body hair isn't attractive for some people, but pus filled bumps aren't attractive either. Plus they cause pain and scarring.\n\nProbably some guys dislike your body hair. But who cares. It's not your job to please random guys beauty standards. There's always someone, that dislikes something about you. No matter what you do. \n\nI recently learned, that in some countries, body hair is considered really attractive. There are even \"pube wigs\" to conceal the flaw of lacking hair. The body hair is considered as an sign for adulthood. \n\nShaving the body hair is an relatively new trend. Hairless skin is a beauty standard, constructed by society, and fueled by the companis that sell razors and stuff. \n\nShaving should be a personal choice, but no one should be obliged to do so. I personally prefer my body to be smooth, but can't shave because of neurodermatitis. I just trim the hair, when I feel like doing so.", "NTA. The only way to change the expectations is not to give into it! Shave or don\u2019t shave, it has nothing to do with cleanliness. I shave when I feel like it but I\u2019ve gone whole summers with hairy pits and legs visible to the world! I\u2019m actually more likely to shave in the winter because I don\u2019t like the feeling of long leg hair under long pants. I usually do shave in the bikini area, but that\u2019s my own personal preference and not because it\u2019s expected. My partner could not care less either way what I do or do not shave!", "I'm currently dealing with very painful cysts that resulted from shaving under my arms. Even using brand new razors, it happened to me twice.\n\nNTA-it sucks that your mom is upholding harmful ideals over you.", "NTA, but most guys DO care, at least the ones who are interested in dating, but all but the most douchey guys will say to do what you want since it's your body and some will decide they don't want to be with a woman who doesn't shave her pits. Some won't care at all or at least enough to be turned off by it and some are downright into it.\n\nEither way, I don't know why your mom has a problem with it, so not the AH here.", "NTA. How does she even see it if you're covered up?", "NTA they are being sexist. The only reason women are expected to shave is some marketing bs nonsense starting from the early 1920s. Shave if you want, don\u2019t shave if you don\u2019t want. It should be nobody\u2019s choice but your own. \n\n(Also super gross your mother is telling you that it\u2019s more important that you be \u201cattractive\u201dto boys than comfortable in your own skin.)", "Nta. You need fresh razors every few weeks. Shaving with a full razor will cause harm. I\u2019ve found using a bristle scrub brush on my legs before shaving helps with the razor burn as it removes dead skin and sort of fluffs up the hair.

I hate shaving because I, personally, think being covered in red spots looks worse than hair. It doesn't matter if it's the first time I've used the razor or the 7th. Waxing/epilating is actually worse, imo. What I find helps is shaving with instead of against the hair, so I deliberately don't get a clean shave and the hair can't grow in to the skin. Or using an electric razor, like a guy might use on their hair, coz you get a clean 1mm. It's not pretty, you perpetually look like you haven't shaved for 2 days, but as you say it's winter and no one will see. If your mum is weird about hygiene then it's a compromise.
