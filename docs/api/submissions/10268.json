It's fashion - that's it.", "If this was the only comment I got I would probably be having a breakdown in the bathtub with a razor right now but because like 99.99% of the comments are saying fur on me is fine, I think maybe\u2026 just maybe\u2026 this is a man who wants a hairless girlfriend\u2026 but what do I know \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "This is exactly what I use to buzz everything down short! It's so great!", "She really does care a lot about looks, especially my weight and legs. I\u2019ve gotten used to it, and I know she\u2019s just projecting because she\u2019s unhappy with her weight and probably her legs too, but it\u2019s still a big unhealthy in my opinion", "I haven\u2019t, I could probably snatch my stepdads, but knowing him he would be grossed out I was using it on my legs \ud83d\ude05", "An oil scrub will make your legs feel all smooth like they've just been shaved even if you have hair; bath and body used to have a honey shea sugar scrub, but it's discontinued,  might still be on ebay. You can use sugar and coconut oil or almond oil and really exfoliate and moisturize, and your skin will feel so silky and bump free - but warning, your shower will be VERY slippery. For razors, I love the Schick Quattro, it has a little weight to it and they make sensitive skin heads, and it doesn't dull very fast. I can use that sucker forever.", "I think she assumes most electric products are a waste, since she gets me electric toothbrushes once or twice a year and I don\u2019t use them and they end up in the trash in favor of normal ones. I think she assumes I would toss an electric razor too", "Interesting. I\u2019ve only ever used stick because that\u2019s what my mom buys, and it has worked since I was 11, but I haven\u2019t tried anything else so I wouldn\u2019t really know what\u2019s best. Next time I need deodorant I\u2019ll ask for both so I can try and see what works the best for me. Thanks!", "I got a heating pad, which helps. It just never is \u201chot enough\u201d though to be fair my \u201chot\u201d is like 200+ degrees, to where I\u2019m as red as a lobster", "I guess it's a part of being 16 to stand up for oneself, and to emancipate from parents. I know it's hard. But it's healthy and important for your own sanity (not only talking about body hair). Don't shave for your mother. She has to learn and accept that you make your own decisions. Be polite but firm. Please don't take her reactions to personal. She probably doesn't know better.\nI cut my hair short and dyed it blue when I was 17. My parents reactions were ...intense. But it was such an important step for me. It was a sign for becoming adult, and emancipating from toxic structures. \nTwo years later our elderly neighbor told my grandma, that she was so relieved, when she saw my blue hair. Because then she knew, that I'll make it.", "I would never date a guy who would be stuck up on a little fuzzy legs haha \n\nMy very little pride is too much for that \ud83d\ude02", "She comes into my room when I change to ask questions or when I\u2019m in the bath or shower she comes in to ask stuff or check to make sure I\u2019m not drowning. (She literally banned me from baths when she\u2019s not awake because she\u2019s worried I\u2019ll fall asleep and drown) \n\nHer excuse is \u201cher house, she can go where she wants\u201d", "I\u2019m slightly overweight (not anything crazy, just a few pounds chubbier than I would prefer, and I\u2019m working on loosing the weight) \n\nIt\u2019s probably just how my hairs grow, and how I cut them", "Eventually I shall be freed from the prison that is \u201cshaving my legs\u201d \ud83d\ude02\n\nNot sure I\u2019m ready to adult, but I think it will be good for me", "If shaving was hygienic I would do it, and make my stepdad do it, and my brother, and my bio dad\u2026 \n\nBut It\u2019s not really proven to make you cleaner, just shiny for like 40 minutes before it grows back", "If your hair gets really long inbetween shaves, it's best to trim it down with a trimmer first before you use a (new, clean) razor. Also try exfoliating first with a homemade sugar scrub. \n\nI feel like you were never shown how to shave properly and that's why you're having issues. Well, that and not being provided proper shaving equipment. \n\nBut even if you didn't want to shave under the best circumstances it shouldn't matter. It's your body. I would never make my daughters shave if they didn't want to. My oldest girl cut herself the 3rd or 4th time she shaved and she wouldn't touch a razor for a year. The only thing I said to her (after making sure she was OK and properly bandaged up) later when she wanted to shave again was if she needed me to give her a refresher course. \n\nI just dont understand parents like that. I'm sure I do things that other parents would be like WTF?! about, I'm far from perfect but I at least make sure my kids have what they need and know how to use stuff. \n\nNTA, obviously. \n\nDo you even have access to shaving cream? If you don't you can mix a bit of conditioner and body lotion. Always put lotion on after shaving and drying off. Also, don't put deodorant on your armpits after shaving for at least an hour.", "Maybe try the electric toothbrush out a bit? They also rock! (Unless they make your teeth or gums hurt ...)", "To be fair, she also doesn\u2019t like when I alter anything about my appearance such as cutting my hair. Hell, I wanted highlights because I had them a few years ago, she refused. Tho to be fair, it ruined my healthy hair and it\u2019s still a bit dry and less natural now. I think she\u2019s just still stuck thinking I\u2019m her baby girl, who needs to be utterly protected and watched", "Good for you. I'm not trying to tell you to shave, I'm just trying to tell you that if guys can see it, many will care once they are aware of it. Whether they say something or just lose interest quietly, who knows.", "I\u2019m almost 30 and I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready to adult so \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f you kinda just do it and look up one day and realize you are in fact, adulting.", "I use an electric razor all the time! It's so great!", "The way I see it is that my body isn\u2019t an enemy, it\u2019s just my friend. I wouldn\u2019t force my friends to hurt themselves so why would I make my poor legs have cuts and bruises on them\n\nPlus, warmth like the animal I am", "I have access to shampoo and conditioner, and if I took my moms body wash I change that. \n\nI do lotion after shaving, but I admit to putting deodorant on right after I shower", "Yes, bizarrely hair conditioner makes a great shaving lubrication. It\u2019s better than shower gel I find. I think because it\u2019s thicker and silkier so the razor glides better? However it does tend to clog the razor a bit.", "Multi purpose hairs haha \n\nFor the low price of free, good for all weather and conditions", "I do, for about a month but they end up getting crusty and gross and smell awful no matter how well I keep them clean and dry it off. Probably has to do with the humidity in my bathroom, but I would rather use a normal brush than one that smells moldy and sour", "Maybe in that case I\u2019ll date a girl lol \n\nOr maybe I\u2019ll find the perfect guy one day who doesn\u2019t mind a bit of hair, the world works in weird ways", "I feel like most adults I talk to say they aren\u2019t even adulting yet and just going with it \n\nThen again life is just kind of going with it and hoping it turns out ok \ud83d\ude05", "I'll try and find the link for you - I bought a man's (cordless) electric razor on sale, once, and I use it when I need to buzz the long hair down. It works a trick, and super quickly, and I don't have a problem with ingrown anything anymore. If I chose to shave all the way down for whatever reason, I touch it up with a woman's razor and shaving cream after.\n\nIt works like a charm! And it's especially great in winter! So fast!", "Yes to all of this :)", "Your mom has some crazy opinions and standards.", "Ohhhhh - can you change the brush attachment? is that the part that gets gross? Or does the nastiness get into the mechanism of the brush itself / the handle?\n\nI don't mean to micromanage your life of course! \ud83d\ude1b", "I hope so, I really do. Be yourself, if people don't like it, then they aren't the people for you.", "Having something quick and efficient would be great, it takes like half an hour to shave \ud83d\ude02", "No it\u2019s fine! I change it, and then it\u2019s still crusty around the part where you change it. And then if I clean it EVERY time I brush my teeth, I just piss myself off because I\u2019m literally cleaning a toothbrush that didn\u2019t clean my teeth aswell as I\u2019m cleaning it \ud83d\ude02\n\nNormal ones just work much better for me because I don\u2019t want to baby a toothbrush lol", "That\u2019s my philosophy so far lol\n\nHasn\u2019t failed me much yet", "Omg GIRL I am finding the brand for you right now. It is so quick. (I mean, do be careful, but SO QUICK.)\n... Also, I'm probably doing it wrong, but I do it in the bathtub before washing actually, so then I can just sweep up all the fluffy hair easy peasy. Not as much mess, no icky drain cleaning; yay!", "If you want to shave, invest in better razors. Hell, tell your mom that you can\u2019t because of the dull razors and if SHE thinks it\u2019s important she should buy you new ones. \n\nAlso, I\u2019m not sure if you do, but don\u2019t share razors. That\u2019s also unsanitary. \n\nPersonally, if you can get them, I love the schick intuition razor. You don\u2019t have to use extra shaving cream as it comes with the blade. So quick and easy.", "hahaha fair point to you. I have a washcloth for my toothbrush that I use after finishing, to just take it apart and wipe it completely dry before putting it back together again. It's part of the routine, so I don't notice it now, but if I stopped to think about it I might get grumpy about pampering the toothbrush, haha. (Then again, I'm a bit weird: I also wipe down the sink after using it every time. I only had one bad experience with mold in my life, but it's enough to make me want to keep things bone ass dry FOREVER!)", "Shit, I'm in my mid 40s and it's served me well. You could do way worse than just being yourself.", "Honestly,  you'd be surprised how many guys, when you're in a serious relationship,  are completely oblivious. Like, you could stop shving for Fall and Winter and January rolls around, and they're like, \" Hey babe, did you not shave your legs?\" And you'll say,\"Nope. Haven't since October. \" And he'll just go.\"Oh. Huh.\" Shrug. And that's it. No big deal. Because he's a grown ass man who doesn't give a shit about a little hair.", "Thanks! I\u2019ll definitely check it out", "I do admit to using hers from now and then just because she seems to always have new ones that are sharp and not rusted \n\nI\u2019ll check out the ones people here have recommended and see what I can do", "I do dry off my sink and stuff (hell, my brother always pisses all over my bathroom floor and toilet, which makes me go feral, but he\u2019s a boy and 6 so what can you do) so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m not clean, but I usually take around 2 minutes to beat the life out of my gums and teeth, then rub my brush on my towel and toss it back into the container \ud83d\ude02\n\nI\u2019m lazy, but clean. I just\u2026 like the bare minimum \n\nWet sinks, however, I will dry religiously. Drives me mad to put a book or something down and it gets wet", "True \n\nI could be my mom and pester all my friends to shave \ud83d\ude02", "If any man runs screaming from my hairy legs I think I\u2019ll take that as a sign I dodged a bullet \ud83e\udd23\n\nMaybe one day I\u2019ll find the perfect guy who doesn\u2019t mind my heinous crime of leg hair, but until then I\u2019m perfectly happy reading romance books and being single"]}
