Also, has she ever sincerely apologized?", "NTA according to further comments. It would be one thing if this one was incident and the sister was remorseful and asked for forgiveness and proved herself to be a good person otherwise. I really do think everyone deserves a chance to earn forgiveness. But it sounds like she's never apologized or shown remorse, so. NTA.", "NTA\n\nIt's not up to anyone but you to decide who to talk to. \n\nDid your sister ever apologize? Consider  easing your mom's stress by stopping by when sister is there. Walk out if she's rude.\n\nNo need to include her in your life though. Hanging onto the vitrol can harm you though. Letting that go while retaining the space is fine.", "NTA. I learned not to trust either of my sisters, one at 16, the other at 25. I never trusted them again.\n\nOne died of cancer a few years ago, the other I'm not in contact with as she had threatened to unalive me. I wouldn't give her money and she told her friend I was abusive to her. Her friend told her that refusing to give her my money was not abuse.", "A bit extreme, but it\u2019s your right to feel that way. \n\nNTA.", "NTA, but you are largely spiting yourself.  Based on your responses your sister won;  She is living her best life and you are breaking family bonds to avoid and scorn her.  Rather pathetic, but you clearly hate your sister more than you love your mother.", "NTA\n\nForgiveness is something you do for yourself, not anyone else, and it basically happens when you're able to quit devoting time and energy to being angry at the person. It does NOT mean you forget what they did, or set yourself up so they can harm you again.", "I'm sure some more information could be helpful about other ways that she has harmed you, but for lack of a better term, the \"vibes\" seem off with her and someone that unapologetic does not deserve your attention or acknowledgement.", "NTA but you are very petty. Do you really think your older sister cares if you are at this events or not? At the most she feels like she won, because you are too petty to go anywhere she is and so she still has a lot of power over you. And that is just hurting your mother. \n\nI get, that you don't want to interact with your sibling. But to avoid everything she is just because she was an ass to live with and growing up - hm, it depends on the intention. If you are psychiological not able to see her or if you feel worse everytime you have to see her, yes it is a valid reason not to attend and to ask your family not to invite her. But if it is just the reasun you said above *\"she doesn't deserve my presence\"* that sounds very narcissistic and as if you think you are the center of everything and you take something away from your sister just by not seeing her", "ESH. It\u2019s been 10 years, while I don\u2019t see anything wrong disowning your sister I don\u2019t see any reason you can\u2019t make an effort to see the rest of your family more. Some large family event isn\u2019t required to go see them. Also even with these larger family gatherings you\u2019re hurting yourself and your family more than your sister whom to your understanding doesn\u2019t seem to care. \n\nI have a very similar relationship with my brother and I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that some people aren\u2019t worth the energy it takes to hate them, it\u2019s exhausting and often a double edged sword in terms of the emotional and mental toll it can take on a person. I personally strive for the Drake & Josh method of not hating somebody but simply being done with them, and not letting them effect my life any longer. \n\nI understand you don\u2019t say you hate your sister but going to such an extent to avoid her doesn\u2019t seem like the best answer imho.", "Wtf does (26m) an the (30f) mean", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
