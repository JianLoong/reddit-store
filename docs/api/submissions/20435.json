We eat dinner at 7 as a family. This is non-negotiable, because the girls get home at 6 from afterschool activities, and we both agreed that they should sleep preferably at 9-10. \n\nDinner is usually a chance for us to sit and bond, and because my wife works from 9 to 4-5 during the weekday she usually barely sees them during the weekdays. (We spend a lot of time together on the weekend though). Additionally, she isn't vegan or anything, but she comes from a Buddhist family and prefers to reduce animal produce in her diet. Because of this, she comes home and usually takes a lot of time to make her dinner by herself. When she's done making the food, either one or both of the girls are finished eating, or they're almost finished eating and she has missed out on a lot of them talking about their day. \n\nI've tried finding solutions, like cooking for her beforehand or cooking a vegetarian meal for the whole family, but she doesn't like my cooking (even when I try to imitate her meals). So far, I've been texting her what she wants to make and cleaning/prepping the food for her, but sometimes she changes her mind or she takes a while to cook anyway. I've tried talking to her about it, but she says, \"What do you want me to do?

She\u2019s gone 45-50 hours a week. You\u2019re used to wfh, but that\u2019s totally normal in most households.", "YTA for treating her like a child and COMMANDING her. You guys are partners and you need to problem solve with her, not command her. Why not just have dinner a bit later like at 7:30? You should be trying to find solutions with her - not forcing them on her. That\u2019s just so not cool. Kindly and gently tell her how her not joining the dinner hurts you and ask her if there\u2019s anything you guys can do together to come up with a solution. And go from there. But ultimately it needs to be you two against the problem: not you two against each other.", "YTA.  There\u2019s no reason dinnertime has to be \u201cnon negotiable\u201d.

Let her eat in peace!\" #MarriageCounselingNeeded", "YTA. She is using the time to decompress. Let her. Stop being so rigid with time and embrace fluidity. \n\nI grew up in a house like yours where everyone had to eat the same thing. It gave us disordered eating.  Some people need to prepare food in the moment for how they feel versus having someone do it for them. \n\nWhat you see as nice is really forceful. Your kids may seem like they appreciate it now but in a few years they will hate it, and you, for forcing them to sit down at the same time every night. Have family dinner but let the kids and wife make some plans. \n\nYou seem somewhat obsessed with time. Your wife is commuting. Let her decompress and you can stop being so pushy at the same time.", "NTA.", "Maybe cooking is her way of relaxing and connecting with her body. Best you could do is see if she can cook enough to have left overs a couple times a week.", "This could be an eating disorder.\nPlay around with food so noone can tell you skip meals.\n(But the comment of her starving doesnt sound like it is).\n\nINFO: how often do you see her eat? As in actially chewing and swallloving. And not visiting bath room for a few minutes directly after the meal.", "Hi OP, does anyone by chance chews with their mouth open? Because that sounds exactly like how i try everything to avoid my flatmate lol", "YTA.", "NTA, but your wife is.", "YTA \n\nYou need to adjust dinner time! If it doesn\u2019t work for her, then it doesn\u2019t. You sound like an awful husband.", "Oh good call.....", "yes, i sit with her when she finishes making food and i catch her up on what the girls talked about. That's the time where we make plans and discuss other things too.", "She works an hour away from home. She's actually away for 45 to 50 hours if you include commute time.", "I'm confused because OP says she finishes 4 -5pm and it takes an hour to get home. But says the kids don't get home until 6pm after their after school activities anyway so they're all coming home the same time. So not sure what he means by she barely sees them on weekdays.\n\nI assume OP is saying he cooks the family dinner so the kitchen is unusable until he's finished and then his wife cooks her dinner after him which is why she misses them eating. But why can't she make the family dinner for everyone instead then? Or OP preps the family dinner earlier?", "Yeah, you\u2019ve nailed it.\n\nOne small addition. I think your wife is carving out some alone time for herself. The meals are just an excuse.", "It's probably that meal prep and cooking is a transitional ritual for her and she needs it to feel relaxed at home.\n\nShe should take some weekend time to teach husband how to prep for her cooking, so she can come home and cook without pushing the kids' schedule back too much.\n\nIf OP has tried to cook for her and she rejected it--then that's what they need to work on.", "My wife leaves work at 4-5 and arrives home at around 5-6 (usually between 5:00 and 6:00, hardly later than 6) depending on traffic.", "An alternative would be for her to postpone her dinner, have a little entree while everyone else is eating and then do her ritual meal prep after the family meal.", "The kids seem to be fine eating his cooking. Wife making an entirely separate meal every night is ridiculous, especially since OP offered to make meat free meals.  She can\u2019t spend a couple of hours on the weekend meal prepping?

He's tried asking her what she wants to eat and doing all the prep work for her, so all she has to do is actually cook it, but she'll get home and change her mind, or she'll still make the same thing but nonetheless takes forever to cook it. He's asked her to for ideas, he's asked her to be present with the kids, and she won't budge.", "I agree she should sit down with the family, but why do you think she's \"electing\" to work?", "My wife is a data analyst for a small shipping company of sorts. She used to be in a managerial role but stepped down after our girls were born. She enjoys her work to my knowledge. I've met her boss and a few of her coworkers at a gathering, they all seem to be very cordial people.

Something a dad would be pilloried for is often fine for a mother to do on here and they have to say OP should do more to find out why she behaves shitly - completely putting the onus on him. I hate having to say this too but it\u2019s so often the case that it sticks out like a sore thumb to me.", "OP has tried prepping for her but then she wants to cook something else.", "That\u2019s what a divorced parent does with their kid(s).", "I think they mean she\u2019s taking on extra work by cooking for herself or starting over when he does the prep work, not in regards to her going to work.", "Yes, but you can't dictate to your spouse like this.

This is non-negotiable\n\nAnd here we have another dictate from OP that it *will* be done this way no matter what anyone else wants.  Why is OP so rigid on this?  They want the kids in bed by 9 or 10, so there's plenty of time for them to have dinner a little later than 7 if that would work better for Mom.  I'm guessing she has tried to negotiate a later dinnertime, and OP refused to budge at all.", "So? A lot of countries have dinner at that time and kids eat at the same time as everyone.", "Id love to hear his answers. Late bedtimes to cram in maximum family time become mom works until 4-5.... And she doesn't see the kids? He sounds rigid as fuck and I dont blame her. \n\nThank God he works from home so he can see them nearly every second. I actually went back to see if they are homeschooled because I wouldn't be surprised. I'm getting down voted for whatever reason. I guarantee her life is like Alice in Step Brothers (Derek's wife). OP is displeased by her lack of Stepford wifeness", "I was thinking the same thing", "I was only pointing out an inaccuracy.
