I work mostly remotely at home, so I've been the one to take care of our girls (6 and 8 respectively) for a few years now. I drive them to school and to practices, and I usually eat lunch with them. We eat dinner at 7 as a family. This is non-negotiable, because the girls get home at 6 from afterschool activities, and we both agreed that they should sleep preferably at 9-10. \n\nDinner is usually a chance for us to sit and bond, and because my wife works from 9 to 4-5 during the weekday she usually barely sees them during the weekdays. (We spend a lot of time together on the weekend though). Additionally, she isn't vegan or anything, but she comes from a Buddhist family and prefers to reduce animal produce in her diet. Because of this, she comes home and usually takes a lot of time to make her dinner by herself. When she's done making the food, either one or both of the girls are finished eating, or they're almost finished eating and she has missed out on a lot of them talking about their day. \n\nI've tried finding solutions, like cooking for her beforehand or cooking a vegetarian meal for the whole family, but she doesn't like my cooking (even when I try to imitate her meals). So far, I've been texting her what she wants to make and cleaning/prepping the food for her, but sometimes she changes her mind or she takes a while to cook anyway. I've tried talking to her about it, but she says, \"What do you want me to do? Starve at the dinner table?\" She says she wants to hear about their day too, but it's just not feasible. \n\nSo I told her that for Tuesday and Thursday, I am going to make food for us as a family, and she will eat it with us. She told me that I'm an asshole, because she works hard everyday and she just wants to eat her own food, not be forced to eat mine. I just think it's important to spend time with family during the week. AITA?\n\nAlso, I think I'm a pretty fair cook. I'm not amazing or anything, but the girls like my food.

Is it burnout? She needs that time to herself? Does she not feel connected to the girls or awkward being the one who has to be less involved.  But call her on it if she says should she starve then say yes or she can meal prep have a bar or something small or just eat what\u2019s there.  And if she really wanted that quality time, she would.

Treating it as a strange, aberrant thing that one parent works outside the home for 35-40 hours a week is pretty bizarre.\n\n  \nForcing another adult to eat food they don\u2019t like rarely goes well.  Fights and resentment and tension.\n\nBut what your wife is doing does sound unreasonable - it shouldn\u2019t routinely take over 2 hours to make a weekday dinner.  If she wants to cook for herself, she needs to start choosing recipes that are less time consuming or doing much more advanced prep after the kids are abed.\n\nESH - you for trying to treat her like a child, her for investing so much time into cooking so often that she doesn\u2019t have much time for her family.", "Esh you for dictating and demanding instead of asking and your wife for being disconnected and uninterested in her family, explain that she is electing to work rather than be present in the lives of her family and the fact she can't make time for a 7pm sit down is telling to me.", "Info: does your wife arrive at home between 4-5pm or does she leave work at that time and arrive 5-6pm?", "NTA for wanting family to spend time together.  \n\nSeems like you have offered many ways to accomplish that,.none of which your wife likes.\n\nBut rather than telling her what is going to happen on Tuesday and Thursday, i think you will have an easier time compromising if you allow.her to come up with the solution, since she has shot down all your suggestions.\n\nIf she doesnt provide any suggestions or any viable suggestions, she may be feeling overwhelmed and feel she needs the alone.time cooking/eating in order to decompress.  \n\nI personally think you wanting to share dinner together is a good idea and that many of your suggestions were good ones, so at.this point i think all you can do is put the ball in her court.", "NTA. What\u2019s more important to her\u2026 spending time with you guys as a family, or eating exactly why she wants every night? She needs to compromise here. You seem like you are trying everything to help and the fact that she called you TA shows that your feelings and efforts aren\u2019t appreciated. Sorry OP!", "NTA. I don't believe that whatever you're cooking is so awful that she can't eat it. You've already offered some reasonable compromises, and there are others.\n\nIt sucks to work and commute but these are choices you've both made for your family. She is putting \"yummy food I like\" above spending quality dinner time with her kids.", "NTA. Your wife seems determined to miss out on the one family time y'all have. Mostly that just makes me sad.", "ESH.  You do not get to dictate to your wife what she eats and when.  She could also make more of an effort to meal prep on weekends so she can eat with kids during the week.", "Can you have dinner a little later so that she\u2019s ready?  Or let her do all the cooking and everybody\u2019s food is ready at the same time. Looks to me like you\u2019re both being rigid and not looking for solutions", "I vote NTA but you can\u2019t force someone to change.  It seems like you have compromised a decent amount by prepping stuff for her, trying to cook vegetarian meals, etc but it just isn\u2019t something she wants to prioritize.\n\nI think maybe you should just accept that eating a family meal together isn\u2019t as important to her as it is to you.\n\nThis might be one of those \u201caccept the things you can\u2019t change, change the things you can, wisdom to know the difference\u201d things.", "NTA\n\nHas your wife ever heard of meal prepping? It's perfectly feasible for her to eat her own food and spend time with her children if she can't lower herself to have what the family is having.\n\nIt's perfectly feasible.

Does she not take in account that you also work albeit remotely but still work and manage the kids? And all you\u2019re asking is for her to have dinner as a family. Does she even like y\u2019all?", "YTA.\n\nIf your wife wants time to decompress after work. Making her own meal helps her transition from work to home, a need you don't require right then. \n\nI suspect she doesn't explicitly say this, either because she doesn't want to upset your kids by making them believe mommy doesn't care (which obviously isn't true, but you nonetheless insinuate), or because the last time she tried to bring it up ended poorly.\n\nOffer her to run the bedtime/story routine if you believe family time is important. By then she'll have fully transitioned to home mode and will have eaten.\n\nGive your wife a break dude. She's at work all day.\n\nYou are the asshole.", "Both sides have some fault, but neither has reached AH territory. No AHs here.", "NTA\n\nReverse the genders and the answers here would be unanimously NTA. I don\u2019t know why people are falling over themselves trying to make up excuses for OP\u2019s wife.

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s about the food. I don\u2019t think she wants to spend time with you and the kids, and you should approach that conversation with her.", "YTA -- that was a pretty high-handed pronouncement. Maybe fixing her food is how she winds down after working all day (and dealing with that long commute). Maybe you could be a little more flexible -- for example, how about a sharing time after dinner, where each person has a few minutes to talk about their day? Or something similar. She's got the hard schedule. She deserves to have a little of what she wants in the evening.", "NAH. Family time is important, but so is decompressing from work and eating your preferred food.\n\nYour wife needs to spend time with you and the girls as a family, but it doesn't need to be dinner. You don't get to decide what is important for the family, if dinnertime isn't important for her then it's not important for the entire family.\n\nYou need to be more flexible and ask her what she would like to do as the daily family bonding if not dinner, and she needs to work with you to find something that works for everyone.", "You say you drive your children to school and practices and also eat lunch with them. You go to school to eat lunch with them? \n\nYou sound like a controlling asshole. She's an adult, she can do what she wants. Does she get to do anything that isn't work and children? \n\nYou're going to really struggle as your children get older and want independence. YTA", "Nah, maybe the kids don't need the after school activities until 6pm? Maybe a few days they don't need to do them, and when your wife gets home at 4 or 5 she might be able to have some time with them?\n\nI think if you are hanging on the weekends and spending plenty of time together, this isn't the end of the world, but also she could try to have dinner with you guys at least 2 times p/week, I get the annoyance on both sides.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Because it sounds to me like the main issue is that it bothers him that she wants to be alone at supper, is offended that she doesn't like his food, and declares that \"she will\" sit with her family and eat *his* food. If it isn't attention he wants, then he seeks obedience, which on top of being selfish, is also demeaning.\n\n>. . . or trying to make her take over the parental role alone the second she gets home. \n\nYou're right. He's just trying to force her to do something else to which she is resistant , which is totally cool. Amirite?\n\n>Hes trying to find a way they can spend time together when the available time is so limited.\n\nTo find a way *who* can spend time together? The whole family, her and the kids, or her and him. If time really is so limited, maybe discussing and distilling which of these takes precedence will yield more fruit than forcing his own preference upon her.", "Lol.", "That on its own would probably make them an AH. But I feel its come more from frustration in this situation. clearly offering many options hasn't worked, so maybe they are testing a more aggressive approach. \nPeople make huge sacrifices to be there for their children. She can't even be willing to eat the occasional meal she dislikes to spend time with hers?? Something ain't right in this?", "He's asked her why apparently... she's chosen not to open up and discuss things.\n\n\nIs it so wrong to want quality time with your family?

If the mom was the one handling all kid related activities, household stuff, while working AND cooking dinner every night people would be saying he needs to step up. It\u2019s not asking for much when it\u2019s basically an hour a day being asked for.", ">He's asked her why apparently... she's chosen not to open up and discuss things.\n\nThen meal arrangements aren't the issue; he needs acknowledge this and start there.\n\n\n>Is it so wrong to want quality time with your family? \n\nIt is if he wants it enough to *force* his unwilling spouse to participate, instead of working through the problem like an adult.\n\n>Maybe he just cares about his kids and is concerned about the lack of interaction thats happening.\n\n\nI don't doubt it.
