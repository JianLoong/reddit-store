I work mostly remotely at home, so I've been the one to take care of our girls (6 and 8 respectively) for a few years now. I drive them to school and to practices, and I usually eat lunch with them. We eat dinner at 7 as a family. This is non-negotiable, because the girls get home at 6 from afterschool activities, and we both agreed that they should sleep preferably at 9-10. \n\nDinner is usually a chance for us to sit and bond, and because my wife works from 9 to 4-5 during the weekday she usually barely sees them during the weekdays. (We spend a lot of time together on the weekend though). Additionally, she isn't vegan or anything, but she comes from a Buddhist family and prefers to reduce animal produce in her diet. Because of this, she comes home and usually takes a lot of time to make her dinner by herself. When she's done making the food, either one or both of the girls are finished eating, or they're almost finished eating and she has missed out on a lot of them talking about their day. \n\nI've tried finding solutions, like cooking for her beforehand or cooking a vegetarian meal for the whole family, but she doesn't like my cooking (even when I try to imitate her meals). So far, I've been texting her what she wants to make and cleaning/prepping the food for her, but sometimes she changes her mind or she takes a while to cook anyway. I've tried talking to her about it, but she says, \"What do you want me to do? Starve at the dinner table?\" She says she wants to hear about their day too, but it's just not feasible. \n\nSo I told her that for Tuesday and Thursday, I am going to make food for us as a family, and she will eat it with us. She told me that I'm an asshole, because she works hard everyday and she just wants to eat her own food, not be forced to eat mine. I just think it's important to spend time with family during the week. AITA?\n\nAlso, I think I'm a pretty fair cook. I'm not amazing or anything, but the girls like my food.

That's just rude.\n\nSeriously, I come from a super broken household. Like, no contact to either of my parents kinda bullshit. And yet one of the few things I remember fondly is our family dinners. Because that was one thing we had, half an hour where we just felt like a normal family. You shouldn't skip out on that.", "ESH - because the two of you haven\u2019t sat down and found a solution together. Why don\u2019t you and the girls eat in the kitchen while she cooks.

Why does she instantly get mad and try not to have that time with you and the family? \n\nI get that maybe she wants some alone time after work, but she can do that after dinner, especially since you only wanna cook 2 out of the 5 days for her, she can still have that alone time to cook 3 out of the 5 days. Quite frankly she should wanna grab every opportunity to soend time with her family, her _kids_. I don\u2019t see why she can\u2019t even have an adult conversation about this with you", "It sounds like your wife needs some transition time after work. Like nearly all AITA relationship posts, you need to focus on communicating. Have you considered that the schedule you\u2019ve meticulously lined out for your family is *not* reasonable? Your wife presumably drives an hour+ to work every day, probably gets up an hour before then, so say her day starts at 7am, she works from 9-5, drives the hour+ back home in afternoon traffic, and you expect her to slide right into dinner/family time, bedtime routine for the kids\u2014she essentially is in \u201cwork mode\u201d from 7am until the kids are in bed.\n\nYou need to talk to her and find out if the food is *really* the issue, or if it\u2019s simply an outlet for another issue in your lives. I can\u2019t imagine you\u2019ve made it this far, married with two kids, without being able to agree on meals. Have you all been cooking separately your entire relationship? Something tells me it\u2019s not about the food at all and more about the unforgiving nature of your day to day lives. I know you\u2019re concerned about her relationship with your children, but have you put time into your relationship with each other? It\u2019s easy to get lost in the routine and neglect each other which ultimately dominoes down to other aspects of your life. \n\nIf it really is about the food, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a compromise you can come to without demanding she eat your cooking. If she\u2019s getting home by 6/6:30, maybe you all can tag-team dinner together. Let her take the charge there since she has restrictions, offer to cut the veggies and you two have some quality time together\u2014decompress from your day, both of you, and the rest will come more naturally.\n\nTLDR: Communicate, communicate, communicate!!!!\nEdit: As it stands, ESH", "NTA - at first I thought you were gonna be ngl but after reading your post and seeing that you tried to come up with compromises that she is just being unreasonable, to me it sounds like she is deliberately avoiding spending time with the kids.

If your wife gets home by 6 and dinner is at 7, and if she is SO insistent on what her meal is, it seems like she could just do the cooking herself for the whole family. Then she could eat what she wants and not have to have a separate meal. \n\nIn any case, NTA. Not great to solve the problem by decree, but I understand the frustration and find her behavior super weird. I\u2019ve never known a family where a separate meal is made for one of the adults every night, even when dietary restrictions are at play. I would be very insulted if my partner refused to eat my cooking every single night even when I worked hard to cook what he liked.

I needed to learn to understand that his needs are different than mine instead of assuming he was enjoying that time just because I would.", "That was what I meant to type but my fat thumbs decided on 7 instead.", "Well, reddit tends to hate children and love dogs so that kind of makes sense.", "The lengths this sub will go to avoid saying that a woman is simply a selfish asshole.", "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10l2hhs/aita_for_deciding_to_watch_my_grandson_over_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button", "It makes sense for Reddit, but it's completely disconnected from reality.", "Thank you", "This.  I a 50 hour averaging work week.  If I didn\u2019t meal prep or have quick 10 min meals on hand I would literally do takeout each night.  I couldn\u2019t imagine doing an hour worth of cooking for one solo meal after being out of the house for 10 hours.", "Is that really an excuse though? If a man played video games or something for two hours every single day immediately after getting home from work for some \"me time\", to the point that he's not pulling his weight with the kids, or barely even seeing them at all we'd be tearing him a new asshole. She's not cooking for the family and refuses to eat his cooking so it is purely for her and I don't see much difference here. This man isn't even a stay at home parent and works full time too and he seems to be doing everything involving the kids during the weekdays. This seems to be a very unfair dynamic to me.", "That\u2019s totally fine everybody deserves me time, but she should take her me time after her kids go to bed. She chose to have these kids, now she needs to be a parent to them.", "The problem for me is that she\u2019s taking over 2 hours. That\u2019s a lot of time while OP is still being the primary caregiver. He\u2019s solo parenting from the moment she leaves until the moment she gets home, then she needs 2 more hours to decompress. When does he get to decompress from being a parent all day? They need to have a deeper talk here because something is off.", "Which would be fine but she has kids. Sorry but kids needs take priority over hers now.", "This is 100% right! She needs to communicate it. And if he\u2019s not getting enough like everyone is assuming, he needs to communicate that too. \n\nIt\u2019s way too easy for parents to burnout at this age and start resenting each other.", "She could drive home, decompress for an hour and then eat dinner and the go to bed. She literally and figuratively refuses to let her husband take anything off her plate and as much as I look to cook and spend 30mins - 1hr 30mins a night cooking, I invest that time so that every single meal I cook is eaten by everyone in the house and we can all sit around the table. Also the nights when my gf or cooks are a great relief", "She can do bedtime! What a terrific mom! Takes 2 hours to cook herself dinner every night, but she reads a story at bedtime! Mom of the year right here", "Doesn\u2019t sound like your dad took 2 hours EVERYDAY to decompress before he spent time with you though\u2026", "Not everyone can decompress while commuting--driving makes me anxious and on edge, for example, and so do crowded trains. For awhile I lived somewhere where my commute was about a ten minute subway ride at rush hour and then a 15 minute walk home, and the subway ride put me MORE on edge than working all day. \n\nMy dad often couldn't eat with us growing up due to his work hours, but read to us/told us stories at bedtime, after we had had dinner with each other and our mom. He's a great dad, we are all close, and those are great memories.", "Depends on your commute.  If it's an hour in pure stop-and-go traffic, ain't nobody \"decompressing\" during that--and the fam's lucky if she doesn't go postal the moment she gets home.", "This stuck out to me too! My husband leaves for work at 7am and typically doesn\u2019t get home until 7pm Monday-Thursday (he works from home fridays.) he works long hours and his commute is an hour each way. That said, when he comes home we eat together and he still helps around the house. It took us a few years to help improve his meal prepping (it used to take him an hour or more to make dinner and it\u2019s something he enjoys to decompress after work.) now we do grilled fish and vegetables and dinner is on the table in 25 minutes or less. \n\nOP you are NTA for wanting your wife to spend quality time with the kids when it\u2019s already limited, but don\u2019t make her feel guilty for helping to provide for her family and incorporate her dietary requests into meals. You should also work on efficient food prep with her and sticking to the plan, it\u2019s not cool that she\u2019s changing her mind about what she wants for dinner and choosing to spend time cooking rather than with her kids, that\u2019s a completely unnecessary choice that she\u2019s making.", "My parents both worked the average American worl week my entire childhood I saw them maybe a few hours a weeks so yeah", "I even saw a comment trying to say she secretly never wanted kids and it\u2019s his fault for oppressing her and forcing her to have kids\u2026.", "40 minute commute here and my dash cam is FULL of near misses and people driving like it's their last day on Earth. The best part of my day is getting home and sitting on my porch for several minutes just staring out at the sky, not talking to anyone, just blocking out the whole previous 40 minutes of driving and work day.", "What are you weirded out about? The girls get home at 6, then mom spends a few hours cooking for herself & the kids go to bed an hour later. That's obviously a fact that she's not spending much time with them. It has nothing to do with your parents or anyone else. He's tried asking her what she wants & prepping it & she finds ways & reasons to decline his offers. He might be resorting to treating her like a child, but at the same time, she's not acting like a grown-up with parental duties either, so you reap what you sow sometimes.", "My former roommate was and ardent and observant Buddhist. There definitely is a massive relationship style difference between Buddhists and others. It comes from the no-attachment philosophy required to acheive nirvana.", "I bought a BBQ so that I can quickly cook dinner while my child and I spend time outside instead of him in front of the tv and me in the kitchen. There are plenty of options for making relationships you value priority.", "https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/average-work-week-by-country\n\nIt depends. Obviously I shouldn\u2019t generalize. But if you look at the countries with > 40hr/wk they tend to be less wealthy than the US. 30-37 seems more common.", "I think he said he did the prep for her but she'd then change her mind.", "He did mention prepping ingredients for her to cut down on her time spent making her own meals but said that she will change her mind about what she wants to eat and prep different ingredients for a different meal.", "He mentioned he preps ingredients for her but she changes her mind at the last minute. Sounds like there's something else going on", "I thought of that too, but it sounds like the wife probably wouldn't go for it. OP says that they've tried to prep ingredients ahead of time, but the wife sometimes changes her mind about what she wanted.", "Or have the girls help her make her dinner.", "I agree, but that's what her one hour commute is, whether she likes it or not. If she needs set aside personal time SHE NEEDS TO COMMUNICATE THAT. This is on par with a partner using mowing the lawn as a household chore that precludes them of time with their children. Is it a chore? Sure. Does it still create a burden for their partner WHO ALSO NEEDS TO GET THINGS DONE/A BREAK FROM CHILDCARE? Absolutely.", "Two hours to make a meal for one person, with no leftovers to heat up the next night for dinner.\n\nYeah, she just doesn't want to eat dinner with her family.", "Yes ESH. She should listen to books on her drive home, or podcasts, or music or something to decompress on her drive home so she doesn't have to do it after she gets there. Maybe help her to meal prep for the whole week while you're together on the weekends? Ask her to teach you to make her favorite meals, while making 5-6x the normal amount so she can freeze and re heat things?", "Based on OP's text it seems as if he doesn't have any time to decompress between work and then looking after the kids. With that in mind I struggle to think he's being unreasonable wanting his wife to alter her routine to spend 2 nights with them a week for dinner. I appreciate everyone needs time to decompress but think when you have kids they should take a little bit of a priority over that.", "Yeah... how come that ungrateful b$star&d won't eat the food dear wifey made? Divorce inmediately!!! The audacity!!!", "The fact that he feels entitled to dictate her behavior is problematic.", "Yeah that\u2019s such a stressful situation for me that I\u2019d seriously either have to find a different job or move my family. My 20 minute commute felt like an eternity to me!", "Why doesn\u2019t she meal prep twice a week so she only has to reheat her meals when she gets home at night and can be present for most of the 7pm family dinners each week?", "INFO: Could she cook in bulk and then freeze/re-heat leftovers during the week?", "Is she actively avoiding the girls?", "The entire world gives exactly no ducks about men's feelings", "I wonder if that's part of the problem - their kids are going to bed at 9/10pm. \n\nThere is no 'wind down time after the kids go to bed'. I'd go literally insane if both my kids were up the whole evening. \n\nIt sounds like rather than address the actual issue she's just avoiding and resisting by trying to get wind down time during the evening instead.", "Op did mention food prep she refuses the offer even changes the/menu and ingredients.", "Some people do find driving fun though. Probably depends on what car you have to a certain extent as well.", "I think it depends more on the nature of your commute.  I teach at a state university with satellite campuses, and I was living in a suburb halfway between a satellite in a rural area and the main campus in a bustling urban zone.  My commute was about the same \\*time\\* each way (about 40 minutes), but when I taught in the satellite, it was a dramatically different commute.  Driving to main campus was stressful.  Crowded.  Stop and go the entire way.  Likely to have accidents that required on-the-fly adjustments to the route.  BONKERS stressful.\n\nDriving to the (near) rural satellite was a peaceful and easy experience--long stretches of plain roads with no lights, pleasant trees and houses.  It was gorgeous and actually lifted my spirits to make that drive.\n\nI cannot overstate the difference between driving to Morrow, GA and driving those calm back roads to Peachtree City, GA.", "Wow!\n\nI believe you because I was taken to court for a restraining order. The thing that made her scared is my Facebook status which read \"new year, I wonder what this year will bring\" \n\nShe filled in the paperwork then when the court date arrived, she was on her honeymoon and the judge told me I was lucky she didn't turn up! And not to contact her (I wasn't even in contact with her at the time, I was friends with her brother, it's how I know)\n\nThe judge also refused to accept that the status has no meaning, insisting that every post has a definitive meaning when someone posts something.", "Yeah, I meant if she has such a strong opinion of his cooking then *she* could prep her own meal in advance and spend some time with her family. OP is definitely NTA."]}
