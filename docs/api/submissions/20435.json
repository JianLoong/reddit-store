I work mostly remotely at home, so I've been the one to take care of our girls (6 and 8 respectively) for a few years now. I drive them to school and to practices, and I usually eat lunch with them. We eat dinner at 7 as a family. This is non-negotiable, because the girls get home at 6 from afterschool activities, and we both agreed that they should sleep preferably at 9-10. \n\nDinner is usually a chance for us to sit and bond, and because my wife works from 9 to 4-5 during the weekday she usually barely sees them during the weekdays. (We spend a lot of time together on the weekend though). Additionally, she isn't vegan or anything, but she comes from a Buddhist family and prefers to reduce animal produce in her diet. Because of this, she comes home and usually takes a lot of time to make her dinner by herself. When she's done making the food, either one or both of the girls are finished eating, or they're almost finished eating and she has missed out on a lot of them talking about their day. \n\nI've tried finding solutions, like cooking for her beforehand or cooking a vegetarian meal for the whole family, but she doesn't like my cooking (even when I try to imitate her meals). So far, I've been texting her what she wants to make and cleaning/prepping the food for her, but sometimes she changes her mind or she takes a while to cook anyway. I've tried talking to her about it, but she says, \"What do you want me to do? Starve at the dinner table?\" She says she wants to hear about their day too, but it's just not feasible. \n\nSo I told her that for Tuesday and Thursday, I am going to make food for us as a family, and she will eat it with us. She told me that I'm an asshole, because she works hard everyday and she just wants to eat her own food, not be forced to eat mine. I just think it's important to spend time with family during the week. AITA?\n\nAlso, I think I'm a pretty fair cook. I'm not amazing or anything, but the girls like my food.

That's just rude.\n\nSeriously, I come from a super broken household. Like, no contact to either of my parents kinda bullshit. And yet one of the few things I remember fondly is our family dinners. Because that was one thing we had, half an hour where we just felt like a normal family. You shouldn't skip out on that.", "ESH - because the two of you haven\u2019t sat down and found a solution together. Why don\u2019t you and the girls eat in the kitchen while she cooks.

Why does she instantly get mad and try not to have that time with you and the family? \n\nI get that maybe she wants some alone time after work, but she can do that after dinner, especially since you only wanna cook 2 out of the 5 days for her, she can still have that alone time to cook 3 out of the 5 days. Quite frankly she should wanna grab every opportunity to soend time with her family, her _kids_. I don\u2019t see why she can\u2019t even have an adult conversation about this with you", "It sounds like your wife needs some transition time after work. Like nearly all AITA relationship posts, you need to focus on communicating. Have you considered that the schedule you\u2019ve meticulously lined out for your family is *not* reasonable? Your wife presumably drives an hour+ to work every day, probably gets up an hour before then, so say her day starts at 7am, she works from 9-5, drives the hour+ back home in afternoon traffic, and you expect her to slide right into dinner/family time, bedtime routine for the kids\u2014she essentially is in \u201cwork mode\u201d from 7am until the kids are in bed.\n\nYou need to talk to her and find out if the food is *really* the issue, or if it\u2019s simply an outlet for another issue in your lives. I can\u2019t imagine you\u2019ve made it this far, married with two kids, without being able to agree on meals. Have you all been cooking separately your entire relationship? Something tells me it\u2019s not about the food at all and more about the unforgiving nature of your day to day lives. I know you\u2019re concerned about her relationship with your children, but have you put time into your relationship with each other? It\u2019s easy to get lost in the routine and neglect each other which ultimately dominoes down to other aspects of your life. \n\nIf it really is about the food, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a compromise you can come to without demanding she eat your cooking. If she\u2019s getting home by 6/6:30, maybe you all can tag-team dinner together. Let her take the charge there since she has restrictions, offer to cut the veggies and you two have some quality time together\u2014decompress from your day, both of you, and the rest will come more naturally.\n\nTLDR: Communicate, communicate, communicate!!!!\nEdit: As it stands, ESH", "NTA - at first I thought you were gonna be ngl but after reading your post and seeing that you tried to come up with compromises that she is just being unreasonable, to me it sounds like she is deliberately avoiding spending time with the kids.

If your wife gets home by 6 and dinner is at 7, and if she is SO insistent on what her meal is, it seems like she could just do the cooking herself for the whole family. Then she could eat what she wants and not have to have a separate meal. \n\nIn any case, NTA. Not great to solve the problem by decree, but I understand the frustration and find her behavior super weird. I\u2019ve never known a family where a separate meal is made for one of the adults every night, even when dietary restrictions are at play. I would be very insulted if my partner refused to eat my cooking every single night even when I worked hard to cook what he liked.

So sure personal time is great but sounds like she should be cooking the family dinner a few times a week and taking some of the load here.", "2 hours a day? Plus the girls are in bed afterwards, so yes, I think it is very selfish. When  does OP get time to decompress? She is not open to compromise either and refuses to talk about it. I would be very upset with my partner, if he did that every single workday.", "Divorce at a minimum lol", "Common sense", "A six year old is up until 10 because her mother can't be bothered to join them in family time. She's six. Not sixteen.", "Even if she continues cooking 15 minutes after the family meal starts there is a good chance she misses out on how the kids day is was. Kids are their age do not sit at the table for an hour for dinner. So dinner may happen from 7-715/730. Then the kids may have homework, want to play outside, need to take a shower, do chores, etc. This means the mom doesn\u2019t see them much during the week and chooses to make a special meal every night during the time where she has the best chance to bond. \n\nThe thing that makes me think she is selfish is that I don\u2019t understand what she manages to eat at lunch and breakfast. Does she manage to eat \u201cnormal\u201d meals that would be similar to OPs dinner? Aka not special meals that she prefers. If so, then she should consider waiting to make/finish a special meal for herself after the kids are done eating since she won\u2019t see them much that night anyway. Why not join in for that first 15-30 minutes of a new to bond? I would guess she is selfish.", "Unless there's missing reasons it sounds like she's avoiding spending time together", "Right? I mean a solution that wasn\u2019t even mentioned is some sort of food prep for certain days. That could\u2019ve/should\u2019ve come up as an option.", "Yeah to me it reads that she\u2019s using that time to decompress and adjust to being in mom mode. I think that\u2019s probably what annoys the other parents.", "**I\u2019m pretty weirded out that you think a parent who works less hours than the average adult \u201cbarely sees them on weekdays.\u201d**", "It\u2019s an American joke that I have too many workers rights to understand.", "But the kids can be in the kitchen talking to her while they eat and she cooks.\n\nNot comparable situations.\n\nMy bet is that OP is so overbearing about dictating how she should be interacting with the kids that she's just trying to check out.", "That absolutely sucks that you went through that. Hope you\u2019re doing ok despite that. \n\nI actually posted something myself on here last week about my partner on Father\u2019s Day and although many were in agreement with me, there was a significant minority who asked about her mental load, how much time does she get away from looking after our son etc. Even after I explained it was split down the middle for caring responsibilities, they still suggested I explore why she\u2019d behaved in that way - and asked all sorts of health questions because she\u2019d gone to bed for a nap. Some even suggested she\u2019d gone for a nap so I could see my son more. The hoops they jump through to get to blaming the dad is ridiculous.", ">Also she has an entire hour in her drive home to \"transition\"\n\nAs an extreme introvert, I can assure you that's not enough.", "Oh my God, I said that they should meal prep together on the weekend.

Common sense is that every member of the family should have private time and space and be able to recharge.", "We don't know why they're up that late. OP says that they've agreed upon that bed time.\n\nBut, the reason I corrected you is because the bedtime stood out to me. That's way too late for 6 and 8 year olds to be going to bed imo.", "We don\u2019t know what happens after dinner. She might just not want eat together.", "Tbh I suspect she's deliberately spending a long time in the kitchen as a me time type thing after work", "It's a british meme from Top Gear / Jeremy Clarkson", "Just refer to my last question. As soon as you can figure out an answer that then this can continue.", "His compromise was also asking her what she wants and prepping it so she can cook it still but won't take as long. He would prep what she wanted and then she would change her mind once she's home. Imo she's just refusing to take less than 2h to cook for some reason. Yet she still complains.", "How do you know its is decision? Maybe it was hers", "are you the OP?  or do you know the family? do you know whether the wife offered to cook? they should find a solution that works for everyone that means each person in the family. with a snack 8-9 dinner is working the entire Spain does that.", "because there is no time after dinner, as the kids are getting ready for bed", "Yes, while he is working. Did you miss that part?", "The bedtime stood out the most for me too. My nephews are 7 and 10 and are in bed at 8pm.", "Not an excuse, but she may be dawdling to give herself some time to decompress alone after work.

Are you suppose to be my teacher? as to which memes go where? Cause I can tell that what you *meant* was I shouldn't use humor and memes to address such a serious statement, to which I reiterate *oh no.* Anyway. \n\nThe assertion of statement was absurd, and I responded by highlighting the absurdity. I don't take the statement seriously because it's barely moving a needle. 168 hours in a week. Are *you* telling me that 10 is the difference between \"yeah, that's unreasonable\" and \"**hold the f-ing phone?**\" I responded with humor because that's all that was apropos. I didn't think a grand statement that amounted to \"yeah, so?\" was warranted. \n\nAnd you wanna talk about adding nothing to the conversation?

An hour stuck in traffic isn\u2019t decompression time for most people, it\u2019s just a different stressor.", "Mornings between kids getting dropped off and starting work; after work while kids are at their activities, after the kids go to bed, and on weekends", "This was my suspicion as well. Work all day, drive and home and now immediately sit and interact. I know family is very important, but maybe she just doesn\u2019t have the emotional bandwidth to do it and tries to decompress. \n\nAlso, I disagree that they HAVE to do the dinner together. It seems that that is what dad is insisting on, but you can have quality time in different circumstance as well. \n\nWhy the insistence on that? She can just as well do bedtime, read a story etc with them. But we hear nothing about what happens after dinner.", "Of course I have as well, but when someone offered to do the prep for you because you keep complaining about not spending enough time with your family, and then you come home and decide to still take 2h to eat, you're an ah. You don't think she wants to be at a table with him? Are you in her head? If she has such a big problem about eating with him (which she doesn't because she's completely fine with him seating at the table with her once she's done cooking), she should talk about it, instead of the weird mind games she's doing. If he's an ah for being demanding, then so is she for avoiding her family like that.", "yes, the OP never said that the possibility of her cooking for the entire family came up. this is the info we have. also in the info it seems that both the dad and the mom insist on a dinner time which is different.

It's possible there is resentment there or some other complex feelings about the situation.", "Would you not say that is the same for their partner than? Yet they get the extra time in the evenings while OP is actively engaging with their children.", "What is the compromise on her end exactly? OP makes snacks for the kids, shifts their dinner later and makes it, and deals with them possibly being grumpy and pissed off.
