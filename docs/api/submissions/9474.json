Immediately a close friend came over to \"visit.\" Started talking about her debts and how desperate they were in need of a down payment on a car in order to go back and forth to work, on and on, only wanted me to loan them $2K for the down payment  and then she'd pay me back in two months from her earnings.\n\nYou can probably guess how it ends. I lend the money, two months later there's some excuse, can I extend the payback date another month? A month later they move out of town for a better job, but she swears she will be back in 6 months and will be getting very well paid in the meantime to pay me back.  6 months go by and she's dodging calls and not responding on social media. \n\nFinally a year has gone by, her husband intervenes and he comes over and pays me in cash from his own savings.  Apologizes profusely.\n\nA few hours later his wife calls me asking if she can borrow $600 of the cash he just paid me back with as she had an urgent family expense come up.  So I was like 'hell no' by that point, as I had already given up and was grateful and lucky to have been repaid.\n\nWorse, before this, my grandmother had left me several K as an inheritance, and my mom impersonated my SSN at the bank to put charges on the savings account I had put the inheritance in, and drained it completely. She justified it saying she had paid a lot of money for me as a kid such as buying me clothes and food until I was 18. \n\nYeah, so moral of the story, if you ever win money, people around you will feel they \"deserve\" a cut of it just for the fact of knowing you.  All I can say about your situation is, you owe this guy jack shit and you should block him entirely.", "This is funny, but don't do this. Giving Bob anything at this point could be seen (in a legal sense) as acknowledging there was a contract of some kind.\n\nEven though there wasn't. \n\nFun to think about but not worth the time loss if Bob goes to stupidland and tries to sue", "That wasn't part of the deal. My response to Bob would be: I promised you $1 if I got 77th place. I didn't get 77th place, so I don't owe you anything.\n\nBut I see where you're coming from and I *do* appreciate your snark.", "I so dearly wish I could plant a flag in it and claim it as my own. In truth, I'm retired US Army and I learned it from my friends in the British Army a while back.\n\nGlad to have given you some joy today!", "Okay okay.  So much for snark! Sigh...", "He is not going to sue- for $800? No lawyer will take that. If he is pressing him over the money he can't afford to hire a lawyer and even if he does, all the witnesses will say \"yeah he said he'd give him $1.\" so at the very least, he should pay that one dollar.", "yeah, ik, it woulda been funny\n\nbut some people ruin it for everyone :(", "Small claims would take an $800 suit. People sue for like literally $50.\n\nWhat do you think small claims *is*?\n\nAnd if there were witnesses to attest to the $1, and they can *read* they would know the $1 was for 77th place.\n\nIf it did end up in court, and they hadn't remembered the details, and said $1, well then OP would have to pay $1.\n\nWithout witnesses Bob has a leg to stand on that OP made a partial payment on the contract.\n\nI'm not going to argue this cause I've seen it happen, but IDK where OP lives, so it might or might not.\n\nBut if you think it *can't* happen, you're dead wrong.", "No I said it won' happen because the man most likely can't afford to make it happen. OP already said other people were there, and were laughing at the convo.  He's not going to pay a filing claim to take this to court, that's why he's pressing OP because if he thought for one second he could do that, then that would have been one of his statements to OP.  People filling for $50 usually do it for the principal of the thing, not the money. but it seems like this guy really wants the money is trying to force OP.  \n\nHe doesn't have a case here, it's like lottery winnings not a loan, not a contract, nothing of the sort. I think you are taking it too serious", "You've obviously never been taken to small claims court. Congrats!\n\nWhy are you so desperate for OP to pay Bob $1 he doesn't owe? Are you Bob? :o", "I actually have- for $2000. It cost me $15 to file. Worth it. \n\nI am not desperate to have Bob get $1. If you read more comments, you would have seen that I said he owes Bob nothing. I am just saying your assertion that IF he does give him $1, it will lead to a court case is ridiculous. Because it is. Give him nothing. OR if you feel snarky, give the $1. Either way he's not getting the $800 no matter what he does", "I didn't say it will.\n\nI said it could be used as evidence of *a contract* if he does.\n\nWhich it can. Partial payments can be used in a courtroom as evidence of a promise to pay. That's just a fact. Why are you so adamant to say it's not possible, when it is.\n\n\"He can't afford to sue\" \"It cost me $15 to file\" \"$800\"\n\nAbsolutely some jackass who feels owed $800 over a joke, is just as likely to pay $15 to try to get it as not.\n\nAnd I don't care if you think he *will* or not. I doubt Bob is that intelligent. But it is possible. All I said was that it could be used if he did a thing which is possible. What is your problem with that?", "NTA. Give him a dollar.  That is what the deal was", "NTA. Not even if rubbed some salt into the wound by sending him $1 even though you didn't make 77th.", "NTa. Block him or remind him harassment is a crime.", "Bob is one of those people where, if you won the lottery, he'd be calling you up like \"Hey, we're third cousins twice removed and we may have never met before, but I thought it would be nice to get closer to family and also I heard you won the lottery, but that's not why I'm calling, I promise.\"\n\nAka a leech.\n\nEverybody needs money all the time. You have no way of knowing if he needs it as badly as he's claiming he does either. If, and that is a really hard IF, if you did give him the money you should essentially consider it as giving to charity, but without the tax write off. He's not your friend, and you don't owe him.\n\nNTA", "Lol no, NTA. He said that\u2019s what he\u2019d give you, not what you\u2019d give him. Plus, there\u2019s no binding contract I\u2019m assuming, so you owe him sweet f-all.

I bet he said his joke to a lot of people and would've pulled this regardless of who won.

NTA.", "NTA", "NTA. 10 to 1 he only \u2018joked\u2019 about giving you 10% if he won because he Knew you had a better chance of winning than he did and wanted to guilt you 8th sharing with him.", "Nta you never agreed and he even admitted that you both never made a deal. Just block him and move on you don't owe him anything", "This. Block him after you say this. Bob is trying to manipulate you.", "My dad is former army and I used to hear this one a lot. It's awesome seeing it in the wild.", "NTA block him.", "Lmfao what in the Duck Season Wabbit Season kinda bamboozlement is he trying to trick you into? Lmfaaaoooo \n\n\nNTA. He tried it.", "NTA I must know what game you are playing that has an 80k reward. If I'm reading it wrong and the prize was 8k, I still need to know the game!", "NTA.", "He is entitled to 0.", "NTA, and Id never partner with him after his actions.", "You're NTA. Where does he get off demanding a percentage of your winnings? You never agreed to that. Just tell him to deduct it from your share when he wins.", "NTA. Tell him the agreement was for $1 for 77th place. First place still gets him $1, then give him $1.", "Bob won  77th place and the winnings are exactly ZERO dollars.", "Who wants to bet he was expecting to win and pre-spent the prize?", "I'm still laughing at it.", "NTA. This is a cashgrab on his part. I'll bet he was aware of your skill, and made the comment about him sharing with the knowledge that you'd win.", "NTA, maybe Bob should've played better instead of relying on others? Get good, Bob", "NTA what", "What game was it?", "NTA. The real question here, what the hell competitions do you compete in with that amount of prize money? I think I need to do it too \ud83d\ude02", "NTA (as written. The crux of this is likely that Bob insists you actually did make an agreement, which obviously isn\u2019t what you\u2019re writing here. If some of the third parties present agreed with him and you\u2019re lying to us.. could be different).\n\nHonestly, I\u2019m sad the punchline here wasn\u2019t that you finished in 77th place and now we\u2019re refusing his dollar. That would have been more entertaining.", "Nta block him", "I think OP should give all of us 10% each! It\u2019s only fair."]}
