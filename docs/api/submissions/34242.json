I grew up in an abusive environment and it was the worst during the holidays so I honestly don\u2019t know what a \u201cnormal\u201d birthday is like. I\u2019ve never really celebrated it until I got married, didn\u2019t even do that when we were dating. I didn\u2019t even tell her until she finally asked me when my birthday was.\n\n\nSo my wife (34F) and I usually keep it quiet and small, usually just the two of us. She gets me a nice card and a gift. And we prepare a meal together (and maybe order a cake).\n\nThis year was different though. She had forgotten to get me a birthday card until the 31st, she had to go get it last minute. She didn\u2019t get me anything because she asked me and I said I didn\u2019t know what I wanted this year. So she thought I didn\u2019t want anything. She also told me I was away too long this last 2 months (I was away for work) so she didn\u2019t have a chance to figure it out. Though, she got her parents and friends a nice gift, even though they live far away as well. \n\nI asked if we could just get a cake. She said she planned it, but the place wasn\u2019t open today so she didn\u2019t get anything. This was confusing because if she had planned it, she would\u2019ve known the place wasn\u2019t open today, I said fine, I\u2019ll go get something on my own. She offered to drive me there so she did, but decided to snap at me in the parking lot because the parking lot was a bit insane (with traffic and tight parking spots).\n\nSo I told her off that she should apologize. Then she proceeds to tell me I\u2019m 34 and birthdays aren\u2019t special.

Happy birthday OP! We all have one day a year when we deserve to feel special. The least your wife could do is bake you a cake, or even pick one up from a grocery store if the bakery is closed. Do you get your wife a card or gift on her birthday? Some people don\u2019t celebrate birthdays, but if you do and she doesn\u2019t reciprocate, that seems like a miss on her part. \n\nHappy birthday from a Reddit fellow.", "NTA\n\nFirst off Happy Birthday.\n\nThe very least I expect from my wife on my birthday is a card. You are married to her, she should know what sort of thing you like so even a small gift should not be an issue.\n\nI don't expect cakes and parties, but I do expect to at least be remembered by my wife. After all I never forget her birthday.\n\nThis smacks of poor planning, it has nothing to do with having to be away for work. people with birthdays around Xmas & New year, always seem to get forgotten.", "Deeeefinitely NTA. I would have been super sad really if a partner ignored or forgot my b-day. Not ok!", "NTA - Her behaviour seems out of character (based on what you say in your post) also her outburst about being away was really odd given what the issue was. You might have larger problems or I'm reading to much into it.\n\nEDIT: Spelling", "NTA.  People who have their birthdays around Christmas really get the shaft.  She should know that and go out of her way to ensure you have a proper birthday celebration.", "NTA - it sounds like this is a change from how you both usually celebrate your birthday, even if it is low key. Some of the reasons your wife has given seem a bit weak. Perhaps you can ask her if there's something else going on? Sorry your birthday has been disappointing and hope you get to the bottom of this.", "Happy birthday man you never know if it's your last so that day is special.", "NTA, she became the asshole the second she snapped at you that you're a grown adult so your birthday isn't special. To a guy who was never shown love on his birthday growing up. As a response to you requesting an apology for being rude to tou...*on* your birthday.\n\nShe definitely shit the bed here, hard. It makes sense that you're upset with her. Happy birthday, and I'm sorry it wasn't as you hoped.", "NTA and Happy Birthday! This wasn\u2019t a case of you telling her you didn\u2019t want anything, then getting mad when she didn\u2019t get anything. This is excuses and poor planning on her behalf. Birthday\u2019s ARE special and you deserve to get that one day to feel good and celebrated. Being alive isn\u2019t easy, making another year is definitely worth celebrating. Also she\u2019s your wife, not a gf of one month. My boyfriend is so indecisive and NEVER knows what he wants. I\u2019m also indecisive and never know what I want. We still manage to pull off thoughtful gifts, big small cheap expensive, doesn\u2019t matter because we know each other well and are able to get/create thoughtful gifts. She should at least know some stores you like and be able to stick a gift card or something in a card. NTA and I just want to know why she failed you then attacked you for her screw up.", "NTA.

Classic emotional distancing and blaming the victim.", "Luckily neither my wife nor myself are into birthdays.", "Nah, ya ain't the asshole here. Sounds like your wife dropped the ball on this one. But maybe instead of just straight up tellin' her off, try talkin' it out and explainin' how birthdays are meaningful to you 'cause of your past experiences. And hey, next time give her a heads up earlier so she can plan somethin'. Just my 2 cents though, do what ya wanna do bro.", "NTA. She doesn\u2019t have to get something big or amazing but completely ignoring your birthday is rude AF.

She met what she believed their expectations were (they expected a gift) and what she believed yours were (interpreted as apathy according to your seeming indifference toward a gift until, of course, today). She didn\u2019t even know when your birthday was until she asked you. This means you never behaved differently in said birthday to tip her off to begin with. \n\nWhile I don\u2019t fault her for not reading your mind, she could have handled the revelation with more grace and honesty once you clarified your expectations. \n\nYou could both stand to understand each other\u2019s perspective.

Do you do this on other occasions?\n\nAfter all, it is a downer when someone constantly expresses that they don't care about something. \n\nIf you expect her (or anyone else) to celebrate a special occasion, the least you should do is also be part of that excitement.\n\nIf you wish to remedy this, make dinner reservations for two, and celebrate yourself!", "Do you often have to beg for attention/consideration?

Then buy Christmas at the usual time and put those under the tree.  Birthday pops up 3 days later, and BANG!  There is a card and birthday gifts, and I would also bake his favorite cake either that day or the night before.  Everyone deserves to feel special on their birthday, doesn't matter how old they are.  Your spouse is arguing with you because they feel guilty, and they don't know a better way around it.
