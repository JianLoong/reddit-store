Please don\u2019t post this anywhere else, TikTok ETC. \n\nSo my boyfriend invited me to his sisters wedding, it was all around pretty good and I had a good time until one of his cousins came around and a made me feel very uncomfortable. At first it wasn\u2019t to weird and they were just talking, but he constantly would try and sit next to her and chat really close. What ever, it\u2019s loud and I figured they wanted to talk a bit. \n\nWe ended up later on sitting on the porch with her, where he kept being really weird. He purposely moved chairs so he could sit on the couch by her, where they played and kicked each other\u2019s feet like school kids. He wouldn\u2019t even sit next to me?? Any who, because of that later on I made sure to sit by him on the couch instead and he apologized to her for taking her seat. From there he kept trying to get more information about her and what she\u2019s up to, normal stuff you\u2019d think but he was very insist on her opening up and would not stop trying in an borderline weird way. He eventually made a weird sexual joke about how they \u201cdon\u2019t talk about there time spent in the woods\u201d together?? I didn\u2019t say anything about it because it caught me so off guard and he shortly threw me under the bus about something very embarrassing that I didn\u2019t want shared with other people. I felt like he was purposely making me seem weird in corny of her and tried hard not to cry.\n\nIt really upset me when he insisted how during his next few breaks from school he would visit her and text her a lot more. I never got to do holidays growing up and expected us to do them together, esp because he knows I\u2019ve been planning and Christmas was gonna be our thing. It really made me sad. He knows I wanted to spend it together, have talked about the holidays, esp since it\u2019s by his birthday. He never visits his family but suddenly he\u2019s interested in flying out just for this one girl?\n\nMy final tipping point was when we went to go back to the dance floor, and he said this \u201ci would say I\u2019ll snap you but that sounds to intimate\u201d and I just felt sick. Why would he even imply that?? Wtf does that even mean? Why would that be intimate any way??\n\nAny who after he dropped me off I couldn\u2019t stop crying and told him how weird I found him being with her and how sad I felt because of it. I really was starting to feel like a part of his family, his parents were warming up to me and now I feel destroyed. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m being insecure or not? He says that I\u2019m right and he went to far but idk.", "created_utc": 1693126439, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/162l6lq/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_how_he_acted_with/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How old are said parties?

But I\u2019d break up with your BF because it sounds like he hooks up with his cousin. That family seems too close for comfort.", "NTA. He was extremely inappropriate. I feel you have been given a glimpse into who he is as a person. Think hard about whether you wish to move forward with this. People rarely change and time is the most precious gift that we can never get back.", "The last part about the adding on snap was a bit fucking weird. I have a feeling your bf has a crush on your cousin and he is also painfully lacking in self awareness.", "Okay reading through the comments, I see I\u2019m in the minority, but honestly I think this all kind of depends. For now, NAH. \n\n1) sitting next to her and talking close is pretty normal I think. You said it was loud. If they were close growing up, it makes sense that they would want to catch up. \n\n2) kicking her feet is silly, but normal cousin behavior\n\n3) sitting next to her and not you - again, if he sees you all the time and this is family that he rarely sees, it\u2019s not a great move on his part but I don\u2019t think it says anything about him having feelings for her\n\n4) trying to get her to open up - again, I think that could be really innocent. Isn\u2019t that what you do when you catch up with someone you haven\u2019t seen in a while? \n\n5) the woods comment I think you\u2019re projecting a LOT into. Why would you assume that\u2019s sexual? My friends and I have jokes about \u201cwhat happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas\u201d \u201cwe don\u2019t talk about that night\u201d kinda thing, and it\u2019s usually nights we drank too much, or there was a big argument. It doesn\u2019t have anything to do with anything sexual. \n\n6) revealing the embarrassing story about you sucks and was very rude of him. I\u2019m still not going to jump to that meaning he has sexual feelings for his cousin though. \n\n7) the school breaks thing - also bad behavior on his part because he told you you could do that together, but also not necessarily sexual. He got caught up chatting with a family member he used to be close with, I think the whole \u201coh we have to do this more often, I have to come visit!\u201d Thing is very very normal. \n\n8) the Snapchat comment is weird. \n\n9) him admitting that he went too far is also weird, but I wonder if he was placating you because you were so upset. \n\nAll in all, the vast majority of what you mentioned seems like you\u2019re reaching a little to project your insecurities onto their dynamic. Most of this does not sound inherently sexual. Maybe a little socially unaware, but not sexual.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He\u2019s extremely loyal and understanding and a great guy, this one incident just makes me feel so weird. I know to a degree I\u2019m a self conscious person but now I keep comparing myself to her and I feel conflicted since she\u2019s much skinnier then me, he was my first and now I feel heart broken", ",,, and you canceled holiday plans with your partne rto be alone with that cousin, too?", "I don\u2019t know if he meant it in a sexual way or not, but it just rubbed me the wrong way and it definitely came off that way.
