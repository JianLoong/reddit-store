Please don\u2019t post this anywhere else, TikTok ETC. \n\nSo my boyfriend invited me to his sisters wedding, it was all around pretty good and I had a good time until one of his cousins came around and a made me feel very uncomfortable. At first it wasn\u2019t to weird and they were just talking, but he constantly would try and sit next to her and chat really close. What ever, it\u2019s loud and I figured they wanted to talk a bit. \n\nWe ended up later on sitting on the porch with her, where he kept being really weird. He purposely moved chairs so he could sit on the couch by her, where they played and kicked each other\u2019s feet like school kids. He wouldn\u2019t even sit next to me?? Any who, because of that later on I made sure to sit by him on the couch instead and he apologized to her for taking her seat. From there he kept trying to get more information about her and what she\u2019s up to, normal stuff you\u2019d think but he was very insist on her opening up and would not stop trying in an borderline weird way. He eventually made a weird sexual joke about how they \u201cdon\u2019t talk about there time spent in the woods\u201d together?? I didn\u2019t say anything about it because it caught me so off guard and he shortly threw me under the bus about something very embarrassing that I didn\u2019t want shared with other people. I felt like he was purposely making me seem weird in corny of her and tried hard not to cry.\n\nIt really upset me when he insisted how during his next few breaks from school he would visit her and text her a lot more. I never got to do holidays growing up and expected us to do them together, esp because he knows I\u2019ve been planning and Christmas was gonna be our thing. It really made me sad. He knows I wanted to spend it together, have talked about the holidays, esp since it\u2019s by his birthday. He never visits his family but suddenly he\u2019s interested in flying out just for this one girl?\n\nMy final tipping point was when we went to go back to the dance floor, and he said this \u201ci would say I\u2019ll snap you but that sounds to intimate\u201d and I just felt sick. Why would he even imply that?? Wtf does that even mean? Why would that be intimate any way??\n\nAny who after he dropped me off I couldn\u2019t stop crying and told him how weird I found him being with her and how sad I felt because of it. I really was starting to feel like a part of his family, his parents were warming up to me and now I feel destroyed. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m being insecure or not?

But I\u2019d break up with your BF because it sounds like he hooks up with his cousin. That family seems too close for comfort.", "NTA. He was extremely inappropriate. I feel you have been given a glimpse into who he is as a person. Think hard about whether you wish to move forward with this. People rarely change and time is the most precious gift that we can never get back.", "The last part about the adding on snap was a bit fucking weird. I have a feeling your bf has a crush on his cousin and he is also painfully lacking in self awareness.", "Okay reading through the comments, I see I\u2019m in the minority, but honestly I think this all kind of depends. For now, NAH. \n\n1) sitting next to her and talking close is pretty normal I think. You said it was loud. If they were close growing up, it makes sense that they would want to catch up. \n\n2) kicking her feet is silly, but normal cousin behavior\n\n3) sitting next to her and not you - again, if he sees you all the time and this is family that he rarely sees, it\u2019s not a great move on his part but I don\u2019t think it says anything about him having feelings for her\n\n4) trying to get her to open up - again, I think that could be really innocent. Isn\u2019t that what you do when you catch up with someone you haven\u2019t seen in a while? \n\n5) the woods comment I think you\u2019re projecting a LOT into. Why would you assume that\u2019s sexual? My friends and I have jokes about \u201cwhat happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas\u201d \u201cwe don\u2019t talk about that night\u201d kinda thing, and it\u2019s usually nights we drank too much, or there was a big argument. It doesn\u2019t have anything to do with anything sexual. \n\n6) revealing the embarrassing story about you sucks and was very rude of him. I\u2019m still not going to jump to that meaning he has sexual feelings for his cousin though. \n\n7) the school breaks thing - also bad behavior on his part because he told you you could do that together, but also not necessarily sexual. He got caught up chatting with a family member he used to be close with, I think the whole \u201coh we have to do this more often, I have to come visit!\u201d Thing is very very normal. \n\n8) the Snapchat comment is weird. \n\n9) him admitting that he went too far is also weird, but I wonder if he was placating you because you were so upset. \n\nAll in all, the vast majority of what you mentioned seems like you\u2019re reaching a little to project your insecurities onto their dynamic. Most of this does not sound inherently sexual. Maybe a little socially unaware, but not sexual.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He\u2019s extremely loyal and understanding and a great guy, this one incident just makes me feel so weird.

My concern is that, no matter how uncomfortable and stressed you obviously were, and I\u2019m sure others were side eying them too, it went on the whole night. Would he have realized how inappropriate he had been if you hadn\u2019t called him out?", "Your boyfriend fancies his cousin.\n\nHim being rude about you, him putting you down, him being dismissive about you, him ensuring there was distance between you both is extremely obvious about his wanting to shag his cousin. Your boyfriend went out of his way to ensure that his cousin knows that he doesn\u2019t think much of you - certainly not when she is around.\n\nFrom his comments about what they got up to in the woods, it is possible they have done so in the past. \n\nHis cousin certainly enjoys the puppy eyed love and attention that he gives her.  Her joining in at playing footsie is very indicative of this.\n\nNow, the fact that the cousin did nothing about his attentions, whilst you were there, says a lot; an awful lot.\n\nPerhaps cousin gets jealous if your boyfriend has a girlfriend. How many relationships have they both destroyed?\n\nSeriously, I do believe it is time to get rid of your boyfriend.", "NTA. Did you tell him about how you felt? What was his reaction?  If he starts being in contact with her where there was none before, I would break things off.", "No clue LOL! Didn\u2019t say, supposedly nothing but who knows if he\u2019s being honest about that. All I know is he said that they are way to close ((again what?)) and that he\u2019s glad I addressed it cause he was being weird. Idk I just think it\u2019s weird that\u2019s how he tried to make her \u201cless stressed\u201d and \u201chappier\u201d", "Honestly it makes me kind of worried because I\u2019m not the type to go through phones or what ever, I\u2019d never try to dictate who he can or can\u2019t message but it makes me worried at who else he snaps? He uses it a lot where as I don\u2019t use it at all because the platform in itself makes me feel kinda gross", "He definitely agreed with me that it was uncomfortable and he had been doing it to try and make her \u201chappy\u201d (?) and that it did come off across as super sexual. As for the woods comment I can\u2019t remember the EXACT wording before but it was a comment in relation to implying something sexual happened, it was weird and super uncomfortable and it got VERY quiet after. I genuinely don\u2019t think he knows how he sounds sometimes but idk a lot of it was just very odd, long hugging between them and the way he grabbed her hand to dance and kinda kept holding freaked me out as well", "My one cousin and me are SUPER close, he would even consider me a sister. But honestly we\u2019ve never been super touchy with each other cause personally I view that as weird. Yes we did drink, but FAR from drunk and was almost completely sober", "I think he knew the snap chat comment was at least a little weird, we did talk to her about her boyfriend but he didn\u2019t seem as checked in about that and I did most of the talking. She had a similar situation to one I had before I met my boyfriend so we kinda shared that with each other, also LMAO honestly a body would be a relief", "I will say he confirmed they haven\u2019t done anything sexual and I do whole heartedly believe that. I will say though that by no means was he rude with me in front of other people, when we were sitting together I made sure to be leaning against him and being very close, he kissed me multiple times in front of his family and we slow danced a couple times. I only ever felt uncomfortable once or twice when we were around her but the rest of the night he was perfect and even said he wants to marry me especially after last night. Idk, I want to think it\u2019s just a Weird misunderstanding", "Honestly I think this is one time where gestapo tactics might be okay. Just approach him, ask him if you can go through his phone because you have concerns. If he says no I think you have an answer. I'm usually against this kind of logic but I think his answer will tell you what you need to know.", "i think your projecting a lot because you personally don\u2019t have family so you\u2019ve never experienced these family bonds.", "i don\u2019t see why she has to be around in order for him to see his family.", "It\u2019s honestly one of the biggest breach\u2019s in trust for me, but I\u2019ll explain why. Growing up my older brother was very schizophrenic and had other issues, he would steal his gifs phone and if he even found things from before they started dating he would yell at and abuse her. I saw this as a huge red flag and I\u2019ve explained in every relationship I\u2019ve been in that I appreciate my privacy and I respect his, I don\u2019t want to go and look through his things and disrespect the trust I have for him. But at this point I\u2019m unsure. I don\u2019t want to because I\u2019d honestly rather not know then find small things to over think", "On that, I USED to be close with my extended family but they are apart of a heavily religious cult of which I don\u2019t participate any more. Because of that most cut contact with the family who left, and the few that are still around we seldom see.

I\u2019m not completely clueless about family I just grew up in a religious one", "We did talk and I opened up a lot to him, it was a pretty emotional night in itself but it\u2019s been hard for me to enjoy that with this feeling. He said he was glad I told him and that he totally agreed he was out of line and pushed it to far. We\u2019re not fighting or anything and I truly do love him, this is just such a weird thing to happen and has NEVER happened before. He doesn\u2019t look at other woman, he doesn\u2019t really talk to them, he\u2019s a pretty good guy. Idk why this is throwing me off so much and I feel like I should let it go\u2026", "She IS around when she sees family - but he uninvited her for the next holidays to visit the cousin.\n\nHe probaly is not into threesomes.", "Could you update if your worries are confirmed? Also just because he isn't sexting the cousin doesn't mean he isn't attracted to her.", "The cousins supposedly lives in our state but several hours away and I work a job that I have to work during holidays etc so I wouldn\u2019t be able to go with him, which he knows. I can get a day or two off during that time but not multiple days to go visit", "Hm, my two cents would be that if he acknowledges it and he\u2019s given you no other reason to suspect anything; let it be but don\u2019t forget (in case any other weird scenarios occur). Or, the alternate route to take if you don\u2019t feel you can do that is to grill him on it and point blank ask him if anything has ever happened between them; acknowledging that doing this may very well ruin or end your relationship with him.", "is he not aloud to spend time with his family ? his entire holiday time won\u2019t be with you, he has a family which he\u2019s aloud to be around", "I tried to ignore it in my head but it\u2019s been keeping me up all night thinking about it and how much it bothered me. I see him tomorrow so I\u2019ll try and talk to him in person", "Their family lives several hours away, he doesn\u2019t really get enough time off work, school, etc to even travel so I\u2019m not sure what he was even talking about?? Plus his parents or sister usually host every year, im not trying to keep him from family but he GENUINELY does not see them that often unless it\u2019s a big event like this. He also only said this to her and not his aunt or uncle", "Allowed", "Good luck, OP; I hope this gets sorted out for you and that the comments on your post were able to help."]}
