I left $4.68 (the difference in what he owed me and what I owed for bills) and a note saying that now he owed people who could collect. I then went out to my car and left. The other roommate did not accept my warning (I had been warned by a previous roommate but AFTER I paid the thief's rent while he was gone, thinking he'd just forgotten...he hadn't) and got ripped off for several hundred. He hit up a mutual friend, got a $500 check from him (and his family was lower-middle-class and the friend was in college...the thief was from a well-off family), then learned his lesson about the bills and lease NOT being in his name, and ripped off the next roommate for a few months before she was evicted for non-payment. I am, to this day, the only person who ever got their money back. He never contacted me again...hopefully yours does the same!

It wasn't $5. It was a substantial amount, and if her sister had previously posted where you could see it a reminder to the borrower to pay up, then you'd have had some warning yourself. You may have helped a few others avoid the pitfall you landed in AND you're going to make her more cautious about who she rips off. Hurt no one but the one that needed the lesson, warned other potential victims, so in this case, NO censure from me. If it had been $5 at McDonald's two days ago, wow. But this case? Nope.", "Did you try calling her?\nI'd even go as far as threatening to sue and getting a lawyer", "Learning experience.

From some of your other comments on here it seems like she borrowed money from quite a few people with no intention of paying them back. She\u2019s taking advantage of the people in her life, which will only get a person so far. I hope you see your money again, but for your own sanity I\u2019d just leave her one final \u201cplease be the person you said you\u2019d be and pay me back when you are able, even if it\u2019s a year from now.\u201d I know it seems soft, but there\u2019s no reason to blow up your world with the stress of getting $200 back, even if you are broke.

You were just the first one to fall for it.", "[deleted]", "Hopefully that means that the rest of the family and friends now know that she's going to take the money and run. Good on you for likely preventing at least one more incident.

Of course I'll help. No one helped me, so I wanna look out for others, but look what it got me. Ugh, I am the asshole yes.", "Personal opinion maybe, but writing it on social media sounds a whole lot more like harassment..\n\nShe owes you money. At some point this becomes a legal matter but it doesn't become a social matter.", "Harass her. You can 100% take her to small claims court if you want, and you'd win since you have the texts and things showing that, yes, she agreed to pay you back and has not. You can also get the sister and other coworkers she's taken money from involved. Depends if the $200 is worth a few hours of your time or not.", "[deleted]", "Very much right. I did post on my account, who I'm a doormat, and I'm sick of being one. I always help out and never get the same thing. She told me she wanted to die, I felt her pain, so I thought maybe helping her won't make her feel that way. She knew that she paid me back bc of a screenshot she said again and again. I talked about it more in person and never liked it. I talked about it. What's sucked she had Christmas, and I had to cancel mine. She was supposed to pay in December. \"Ill pay in December 11\" She said that to me and once again, \"I can't sorry another time\"", "NTA.

Never got my money back either but I could afford it and she needed it. We had a sucky job that paid minimum wage.", "Hey OP, assuming you're in the US by your use of dollar signs, any chance you could get your coworker to state she's never paying you back? That way you can at least declare that on your taxes. \n\nSource: my folks loaned my uncle 5k and he never paid them back so my mom emailed and texted until he stated he had no intention of paying the loan back (which was stated to be a loan) so my folks declared it on their taxes.
