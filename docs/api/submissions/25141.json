I love our life and little family (we have two kitties) and he is my best friend. One thing that he knows about me, and has known since we met, is that I am an introvert and I prefer to be at home than going out. He has always been okay with that. However, he STILL constantly asks me if I will go with him when sees his family or when they have get togethers. I have met his family and they are nice people, but I don't really enjoy having to spend extended periods interacting with them. I work full-time and the weekends are my time to focus on myself and take care of my mental health. \r\n\nHis parents had a dinner last Sunday and he really wanted me to go with him. I reminded him that I don't enjoy those types of outings and that I need time to myself to recharge. He was annoyed at me at first but then seemed like he accepted my answer, so I spent the evening at home relaxing with my cats and a book. \r\n\nWhen he got back, he seemed off and I asked him what was wrong. He told me that it really hurts him that I won't put in effort to seeing his family and they always ask him where I am and he has to make excuses for me. I told him he doesn't have to lie and I have never asked him to. I am not a social person and I have no problems with that. He still said that they constantly interrogate him and that it's exhausting for him because he doesn't want them to dislike me. I told him that if they dislike me because I'm an introvert then they're not the kind of people I want to be around anyways.\r  \nWe argued for a while and he just kept repeating the same thing that it wouldn't be that hard for me to come once in a while and that he needs support too because going alone isn't fun. I reminded him again that he KNEW my personality before he married me. He and his family are extroverts and it gives me anxiety being around all of them for too long. As an extrovert, I feel he doesn't even try to understand where I'm coming from or what my needs are. \r\n\nHe says that being married brings along more responsibilities with families and I disagree. My marriage is between me and him - NOT his family. We went to bed angry and he has been distant with me all week. He's making me feel like I am not being a good wife and it's really bothering me. \r\n\nI will always be polite to his family and yes, I will go with him on holidays and things like that, but I absolutely need to protect my needs and happiness too. My weekends are the only time I get to be away from the world, my job requires that I talk to people all day.

He\u2019s not pushing you to constantly accompany him. He just wants his wife to spend time together with him and the people he loves occasionally.\n\nI\u2019m an introvert. I need alone time to recharge. The recharging is so that I can use my social battery on things that are important. The list of things that are important should include spending time with your SO\u2019s family at least occasionally, barring any toxicity or other valid reasons to not spend time with them (you haven\u2019t included any so I\u2019m assuming they\u2019re fine).", "YTA. You need to make an effort to meet in the middle. I'm also an introvert, and while there are trips I sit out, I try to be present for 50% of them. You're married now, and if you want to stay that way, compromise is key. This is something that upsets your spouse and you don't even care...", "YTA. \n\nWhy does it have to be all or nothing?\n\nYou seem to think that because you are not able to do socialising with his family *every single weekend*, that you don\u2019t have to ever do it. You are wrong. \n\nRelationships are about discovering the \u201cgrey areas\u201d between the black & white that you can choose when you are single. \n\nYou are currently being incredibly selfish, which makes you the AH in this scenario.\n\nStop making all weekends all about you, and start thinking about how some weekends can have his needs included too.", "YTA. Being an introvert isn\u2019t a pass to just never leave your house if you don\u2019t feel like it when you\u2019re part of a marriage. News flash: most people would not choose to spend their weekend time with their in-laws, but it\u2019s part of being married sometimes. You don\u2019t need to do it every single weekend but only occasionally on holidays is not acceptable either. Think of someone besides yourself.", "Fellow introvert here.\n\nI completely understand your preference - no, your **need** to stay home as much as you can. Sometimes I come home from a social event feeling like all the energy has been sucked out of me. Quiet time at home is the only way I can recharge.\n\nAnd still, I'm sorry, I have to vote YTA.\n\nYes, he knew you were an introvert before he married you. But maybe he thought you'd be willing to spend a few hours with his family, every now and then. He may not have expected that you'd say \"No, nothing has changed now that we're married. I am still **never** visiting them.\"\n\nIn the interests of marital harmony, you're going to have to find some middle ground. I would recommend working out what you can tolerate. Not enjoy, but tolerate. Perhaps three hours, every couple of months? You'd still have the majority of your weekends to yourself.", "YTA. Like it or not, your husband\u2019s family is your family now too, and it\u2019s completely reasonable for him to want you to come with him to see them every once in a while. I\u2019m also the type of person who likes to be at home more than anywhere else, but I still make the 2-hour trip out of town to spend the weekend with my in-laws from time to time. It\u2019s okay to be introverted, but you\u2019re also being selfish.", "Honestly YTA. It would be different if he expected you to go every Sunday for hours but every once in a while is a fair compromise - you say he doesn't try to see your perspective as an introvert but do you try to see his?", "YTA.  I\u2019m an introvert too.  It\u2019s not the same thing as antisocial, and it\u2019s not a disease or a get out of being a jerk card.  He\u2019s asking for a couple hours every now and then and you still get the majority free time by yourself.", "YTA. \n\nYou sound like a very \"me, Me, ME!\" person. It doesn't even occur to you to try to meet some of your husband's needs or that he even has needs. Your entire weekend is about you, every weekend. 48+hours every weekend to just focus on yourself. \n\nHis family doesn't dislike you, they haven't been given a chance to get to know you. It wouldn't surprise me if they also stop inviting you to holidays, weddings, larger events etc because you can't expect to be treated like a member of the family when you refuse to even attend one dinner or other outings per month or allow them to get to know you. \n\nI wouldn't expect your marriage to last very long. He has been patient and has made every attempt to accommodate you by inviting you and accepting your no and you see him even inviting you as an annoyance and won't meet him half way.", "YTA. This whole post was about you and your feelings and \u201cthat\u2019s just how I am\u201d instead of recognizing his needs as valid and looking for a way to compromise because you love him and it\u2019s something important to him. Sounds like you love your \u201clittle family\u201d only when he capitulates to your every need. Badly done, Emma.", "YTA. Of course he and his family are frustrated by this. Should you have to go for hours and hours every single time they ask? No, but you should make an effort *sometimes* for your husband\u2019s sake. His feelings matter too.", "Sorry, YTA. You'll be able to push back on some of these events with his family but if you want harmony with him, you need to do some. If they throw some larger parties, maybe skip those but go when it's fewer people. Marriage is about compromise, this will likely be one you have to do.", "I fully understand needing to recharge and being an introvert, but I think there's no growth without a little discomfort. Him asking you to go with him to spend time with his family isn't an outrageous request. YTA.", "Yta", "I understand wanting time to yourself and certainly can support the idea of not going to every family dinner, but if you are never going or only going to a couple holiday events each year, it would be reasonable for him to ask for a little bit of compromise and for his family to form an opinion about your unwillingness to spend any time with them.  A soft YTA.", "YTA. Marriage is about compromise. Your husband is right. It will not kill you to occasionally go. Your post is all about your needs and completely discounts your husband\u2019s needs.", "You want your weekends to recharge? If you keep this up, you may soon have ALL of them for yourself!  As a major intovert myself with extovert family and friends, sometimes you it up because these are people you care about. Why on earth did you even bother gettung married in the first place?", "YTA. Married people do sometimes have to do things they don't necessarily enjoy to support their spouses.  Be it boring work dinners, watching something not exactly your taste, or, yes, occasionally having dinner with the family. You are hurting him. He's not asking you to sacrifice every weekend. He's occasionally asking you to give his family a few hours. If you want to be wholly self interested, don't be married.", "YTA.  Going outside of your comfort zone for a little get together every once in a while is not that huge of a sacrifice for the one you love.  I\u2019m an introvert too. I\u2019d much rather be at home than a social gathering, but I still do it because that\u2019s part of being married and having an extended family.  It\u2019s every once in a while, not every weekend.  Put on your big girl pants and get out of your bubble.", "YTA. \n\nI\u2019m also an introvert and I find my parents in law to be deeply unpleasant people. Sometimes I do stay home when my husband visits and he understands because, well, they\u2019re deeply unpleasant people.

He just wants you to go occasionally, which is a reasonable request.

You do not have to like what you have to do, but if you like your husband you will accommodate him.", "I am also an introvert and I also would much rather be at home than socialising. I think YTA though- being antisocial to the point that you won\u2019t even see your husband\u2019s family (that are presumably not toxic or harmful, just extroverted) for a few hours is borderline pathological.

My marriage is between me and him - NOT his family.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong. When you get married, it\u2019s a marriage of two families and refusing to see it that way often brings problems in the marriage. You entered his family and he entered yours and you are a unit. You may not realize it but not going with him looks like 1- there is a problem with your marriage or 2- you don\u2019t like his family. \n\nYou also say your spouse knew your personality when you met him, didn\u2019t you know his too?

You\u2019re supposed to compromise with your spouse. Holidays is not enough. \n\nIf you really want to set this boundary, go to the next get together, and let EVERYONE there know you are an introvert and you will not be attending any more family events and though you like them very much, you enjoy your privacy even more.

It\u2019d be different if it was every single week but that\u2019s not what it seems from what you posted.", "Marriage, to an extent, is definitely between you and your spouse's immediate family too. You cannot make being an introvert your complete personality. Human beings are social animals and isolation also has a negative influence on our mental health. So do consider that.\nMeanwhile, YTA.", "YTA, do you ever consider your husbands feelings? I am sure his family think that you don\u2019t like them when he has to tell them that you don\u2019t want to go over every so often for a meal. You are so wrapped up in yourself, using the \u201coh, I am  an introvert\u201d to not go anywhere which him. I am an introvert and would never use that as an excuse to not deal with my in laws.", "YTA. Why did you marry him? You\u2019d clearly rather be alone. You didn\u2019t even say that you\u2019d rather he was alone with you than visiting his family. You talk like you want even him to leave you alone all weekend.", "YTA. I\u2019m an introvert, too. A happy marriage requires you both to be happy - not just you being happy. You do understand that there\u2019s another person in your marriage? \n\nHe knew you were an introvert but you also knew he was an extrovert who has a very close relationship his family. If you want a happy marriage you cannot always be focused on your own needs and wants. You will need to consider his, as well. \n\nA happy marriage will require frequent compromise. You seem unwilling to make any compromises or meet him in the middle. You have only your own interests at heart. YTA.", "Marriage is compromise. You're not doing much of it. Yta", "YTA - My way is the highway will not create a happy marriage. He\u2019s not asking you to go clubbing just to meet at a small family gathering.", "Same. I\u2019m an introvert. Husband\u2019s family is smaller than mine, but is FULL of extroverts, except one SIL. You find the one other introvert, you find a corner, and you guys have a glass of wine and talk about how much you\u2019d rather be reading a book while smiling and pretending you\u2019re having a grand time. Every weekend? No. You don\u2019t need to do that. But family events, birthdays, holidays? You make it work. For your partner. Because it\u2019s not only about you anymore when you\u2019re in a long term, committed relationship.", "As another introvert married to an introvert with an extroverted family, I agree with this so much!", "A decent compromise would be to attend large gatherings (thanksgiving, etc)  \n\n\nAnd outside of that, invite the family members to have a small dinner/lunch so that you can get to know the whole family in a smaller more intimate way.", "I think you spell MeMe wrong\ud83d\ude09\n\nAs for OP YTA. A marriage is about two people not just one. Grown ups who love their partner compromise and accommodate their partners needs and not just their own. You have out your husband in an awkward and embarrassing position. If he tells his family the truth, you put him in the position of having to defend you and your marriage. Because that is what a loving partner does. Eventually, he will get tired and worn down. Leaving you to be alone with your cats.", "Emma?", "I mean it was about me and my feelings because I was sharing *my* point of view and the thought process behind my decision. Isn't that what the body of the post is for? To provide some clarity as to why I didn't want to go?", ">That\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong. When you get married, it\u2019s a marriage of two families and refusing to see it that way often brings problems in the marriage.\n\nNo, that's a misconception.  She didn't marry his family; she married someone to whom his blood family is very important.  If they weren't, this wouldn't be an issue.  She married him and she needs to compromise on issues that are important to him and he to hers.  The family itself is important only by extension.", "OP only doesn\u2019t have fun because she refuses to actually spend time with her in-laws and actually get to know them. Maybe if she made the compromise to actually start attending *some* of these dinners then maybe it wouldn\u2019t be so irritating for her.", "Finding the other introverts is key!  Finding a corner is also a great point.  \n\nI don't like to speak up at a full-table convo, but I'm great one-on-one, even with the extroverts.  So I find ways to pull people aside for chats away from the main brouhaha.", "Emma...the Jane Austen book.  It's a quote from when she is very rude.", "It\u2019s pretty revealing that you show zero compassion to him in the post. You need to compromise, it must be horrible for him to have to lie every time", "We all read that it's all about you!!! My recharge time, my mental health, my time! What about your husband? He's making a small request and it's still all about you.  It's your way or the highway. If you won't go once in awhile it will cause bigger issues down the line. Eventually he will tire if you never prioritize him or his feelings. Why did you get married? \nYTA! And a lousy partner.", "Listen we all know your post is going to be in your point of view and how you view it. We also recognized that you will try to persuade things more in your favor\u2026 so even with all that people are calling you an AH, YTA.\n\nListen, I get it. When I\u2019m around my family for a weekend or more (for more then the typical couple hours hang out), I go ghost for a month . They always ask what happen. And I tell them I need to decompress. And now they recognize that.\n\nGoing to dinner once a month won\u2019t kill you, but it sounds like not making a effort will kill your marriage", "You need to compromise.  You don\u2019t have to go every time he does but it should be more than just holidays and such. Plenty of folks here have told you.  Please listen.  Please be more thoughtful towards your husband.  Please be a little less selfish. YTA.", "The problem is you\u2019re having zero consideration for his needs and his point of view. It\u2019s \u201cthis is what I need so I will get what I need\u201d rather than \u201cthis is what I need and this is what he needs so here\u2019s how we will both get the things we need out of our partnership\u201d", "I don't see your marriage working at all. It's already coming apart.", "I get that feeling you have, however marriage is bringing two families together. You don\u2019t seem to be listening to your husband. He loves his family and he loves you, your actions of never going to see his family must hurt him and his entire family. While I know you don\u2019t feel this way, but in your post it really came across as you feel like your better everyone including your husband. Imagine how he feels everything he has to make an excuse or lie to make it seem like your sick or something. Yes looking after you is important but you also have your husband to consider this obviously really hurts him. I would like to hear his side of this as well, maybe reading how much it hurts when you refuse to see the people who raised him into the man who you fell in love with. Without them you wouldn\u2019t have him. And if you act this entitled over being an introvert then he deserves someone who will join him and make new memories with everyone who matters to him.", "I do have compassion for him. I understand that his family is putting expectations on him and it must be hard to not have a perfect bubbly wife to parade around at every dinner. I know he wants everyone to get along but truthfully, I'm not doing anything to them and have no bad feelings toward them."]}
