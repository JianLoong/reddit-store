I love our life and little family (we have two kitties) and he is my best friend. One thing that he knows about me, and has known since we met, is that I am an introvert and I prefer to be at home than going out. He has always been okay with that. However, he STILL constantly asks me if I will go with him when sees his family or when they have get togethers. I have met his family and they are nice people, but I don't really enjoy having to spend extended periods interacting with them. I work full-time and the weekends are my time to focus on myself and take care of my mental health. \r\n\nHis parents had a dinner last Sunday and he really wanted me to go with him. I reminded him that I don't enjoy those types of outings and that I need time to myself to recharge. He was annoyed at me at first but then seemed like he accepted my answer, so I spent the evening at home relaxing with my cats and a book. \r\n\nWhen he got back, he seemed off and I asked him what was wrong. He told me that it really hurts him that I won't put in effort to seeing his family and they always ask him where I am and he has to make excuses for me. I told him he doesn't have to lie and I have never asked him to. I am not a social person and I have no problems with that. He still said that they constantly interrogate him and that it's exhausting for him because he doesn't want them to dislike me. I told him that if they dislike me because I'm an introvert then they're not the kind of people I want to be around anyways.\r  \nWe argued for a while and he just kept repeating the same thing that it wouldn't be that hard for me to come once in a while and that he needs support too because going alone isn't fun. I reminded him again that he KNEW my personality before he married me. He and his family are extroverts and it gives me anxiety being around all of them for too long. As an extrovert, I feel he doesn't even try to understand where I'm coming from or what my needs are. \r\n\nHe says that being married brings along more responsibilities with families and I disagree. My marriage is between me and him - NOT his family. We went to bed angry and he has been distant with me all week. He's making me feel like I am not being a good wife and it's really bothering me. \r\n\nI will always be polite to his family and yes, I will go with him on holidays and things like that, but I absolutely need to protect my needs and happiness too. My weekends are the only time I get to be away from the world, my job requires that I talk to people all day.

He\u2019s not pushing you to constantly accompany him. He just wants his wife to spend time together with him and the people he loves occasionally.\n\nI\u2019m an introvert. I need alone time to recharge. The recharging is so that I can use my social battery on things that are important. The list of things that are important should include spending time with your SO\u2019s family at least occasionally, barring any toxicity or other valid reasons to not spend time with them (you haven\u2019t included any so I\u2019m assuming they\u2019re fine).", "YTA. You need to make an effort to meet in the middle. I'm also an introvert, and while there are trips I sit out, I try to be present for 50% of them. You're married now, and if you want to stay that way, compromise is key. This is something that upsets your spouse and you don't even care...", "YTA. \n\nWhy does it have to be all or nothing?\n\nYou seem to think that because you are not able to do socialising with his family *every single weekend*, that you don\u2019t have to ever do it. You are wrong. \n\nRelationships are about discovering the \u201cgrey areas\u201d between the black & white that you can choose when you are single. \n\nYou are currently being incredibly selfish, which makes you the AH in this scenario.\n\nStop making all weekends all about you, and start thinking about how some weekends can have his needs included too.", "YTA. Being an introvert isn\u2019t a pass to just never leave your house if you don\u2019t feel like it when you\u2019re part of a marriage. News flash: most people would not choose to spend their weekend time with their in-laws, but it\u2019s part of being married sometimes. You don\u2019t need to do it every single weekend but only occasionally on holidays is not acceptable either. Think of someone besides yourself.", "Fellow introvert here.\n\nI completely understand your preference - no, your **need** to stay home as much as you can. Sometimes I come home from a social event feeling like all the energy has been sucked out of me. Quiet time at home is the only way I can recharge.\n\nAnd still, I'm sorry, I have to vote YTA.\n\nYes, he knew you were an introvert before he married you. But maybe he thought you'd be willing to spend a few hours with his family, every now and then. He may not have expected that you'd say \"No, nothing has changed now that we're married. I am still **never** visiting them.\"\n\nIn the interests of marital harmony, you're going to have to find some middle ground. I would recommend working out what you can tolerate. Not enjoy, but tolerate. Perhaps three hours, every couple of months? You'd still have the majority of your weekends to yourself.", "YTA. Like it or not, your husband\u2019s family is your family now too, and it\u2019s completely reasonable for him to want you to come with him to see them every once in a while. I\u2019m also the type of person who likes to be at home more than anywhere else, but I still make the 2-hour trip out of town to spend the weekend with my in-laws from time to time. It\u2019s okay to be introverted, but you\u2019re also being selfish.", "Honestly YTA. It would be different if he expected you to go every Sunday for hours but every once in a while is a fair compromise - you say he doesn't try to see your perspective as an introvert but do you try to see his?", "YTA.  I\u2019m an introvert too.  It\u2019s not the same thing as antisocial, and it\u2019s not a disease or a get out of being a jerk card.  He\u2019s asking for a couple hours every now and then and you still get the majority free time by yourself.", "YTA. \n\nYou sound like a very \"me, Me, ME!\" person. It doesn't even occur to you to try to meet some of your husband's needs or that he even has needs. Your entire weekend is about you, every weekend. 48+hours every weekend to just focus on yourself. \n\nHis family doesn't dislike you, they haven't been given a chance to get to know you. It wouldn't surprise me if they also stop inviting you to holidays, weddings, larger events etc because you can't expect to be treated like a member of the family when you refuse to even attend one dinner or other outings per month or allow them to get to know you. \n\nI wouldn't expect your marriage to last very long. He has been patient and has made every attempt to accommodate you by inviting you and accepting your no and you see him even inviting you as an annoyance and won't meet him half way.", "YTA. This whole post was about you and your feelings and \u201cthat\u2019s just how I am\u201d instead of recognizing his needs as valid and looking for a way to compromise because you love him and it\u2019s something important to him. Sounds like you love your \u201clittle family\u201d only when he capitulates to your every need. Badly done, Emma.", "YTA. Of course he and his family are frustrated by this. Should you have to go for hours and hours every single time they ask? No, but you should make an effort *sometimes* for your husband\u2019s sake. His feelings matter too.", "Sorry, YTA. You'll be able to push back on some of these events with his family but if you want harmony with him, you need to do some. If they throw some larger parties, maybe skip those but go when it's fewer people. Marriage is about compromise, this will likely be one you have to do.", "I fully understand needing to recharge and being an introvert, but I think there's no growth without a little discomfort. Him asking you to go with him to spend time with his family isn't an outrageous request. YTA.", "Yta", "I understand wanting time to yourself and certainly can support the idea of not going to every family dinner, but if you are never going or only going to a couple holiday events each year, it would be reasonable for him to ask for a little bit of compromise and for his family to form an opinion about your unwillingness to spend any time with them.  A soft YTA.", "YTA. Marriage is about compromise. Your husband is right. It will not kill you to occasionally go. Your post is all about your needs and completely discounts your husband\u2019s needs.", "You want your weekends to recharge? If you keep this up, you may soon have ALL of them for yourself!  As a major intovert myself with extovert family and friends, sometimes you it up because these are people you care about. Why on earth did you even bother gettung married in the first place?", "YTA. Married people do sometimes have to do things they don't necessarily enjoy to support their spouses.  Be it boring work dinners, watching something not exactly your taste, or, yes, occasionally having dinner with the family. You are hurting him. He's not asking you to sacrifice every weekend. He's occasionally asking you to give his family a few hours. If you want to be wholly self interested, don't be married.", "YTA.  Going outside of your comfort zone for a little get together every once in a while is not that huge of a sacrifice for the one you love.  I\u2019m an introvert too. I\u2019d much rather be at home than a social gathering, but I still do it because that\u2019s part of being married and having an extended family.  It\u2019s every once in a while, not every weekend.  Put on your big girl pants and get out of your bubble.", "YTA. \n\nI\u2019m also an introvert and I find my parents in law to be deeply unpleasant people. Sometimes I do stay home when my husband visits and he understands because, well, they\u2019re deeply unpleasant people.

He just wants you to go occasionally, which is a reasonable request.

You do not have to like what you have to do, but if you like your husband you will accommodate him.", "I am also an introvert and I also would much rather be at home than socialising. I think YTA though- being antisocial to the point that you won\u2019t even see your husband\u2019s family (that are presumably not toxic or harmful, just extroverted) for a few hours is borderline pathological.

My marriage is between me and him - NOT his family.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong. When you get married, it\u2019s a marriage of two families and refusing to see it that way often brings problems in the marriage. You entered his family and he entered yours and you are a unit. You may not realize it but not going with him looks like 1- there is a problem with your marriage or 2- you don\u2019t like his family. \n\nYou also say your spouse knew your personality when you met him, didn\u2019t you know his too?

You\u2019re supposed to compromise with your spouse. Holidays is not enough. \n\nIf you really want to set this boundary, go to the next get together, and let EVERYONE there know you are an introvert and you will not be attending any more family events and though you like them very much, you enjoy your privacy even more.

Your poor husband. You really expect him to ask the bare minimum of you. Just leave you alone, and he can socialize without you.

Since you two are supposed to be a team now but you also don't really do \"team player.\" By the way, you're not an introvert. Introverts are capable of socializing in small doses. We have groups of people we let in. We're not the life of the party, but we're at least willing to show up TO the party for about an hour until we go home to quiet. I don't know what therapists you saw, but if it's completely stressful to leave the house and talk to people the prescription shouldn't be \"sit in your house and never leave for 48 hrs\" because people are social creatures and we have to occasionally overcome our discomfort as a price we pay for living in society.  But you also don't really care about that---- If your in laws don't like you for continuously shooting down their invitations, then you can feel free to not have to like them. Anyone who doesn't like you \"as is\" doesn't matter because it just lets you self isolate some more. Thjng is, your husband is going to get tired of always showing up to things by himself. And if he just starts telling people \"she's not here because she didn't want to come,\" then it ends up awkward for him.

I think it's about incompatibility and human nature. \n\nYour husband is not wrong in asking you and being disappointed that you don't accompany him to these gatherings. Human beings are social beings, it is natural to want to socialize and spend time with people we have bonds with. Marriage entails doing things we don't like and compromising. You saying, but he knew, he's making me feel bad, etc, is frankly not relevant - because your behaviour is a few standard deviations out of the ordinary. It's not like you have some cute quirk, you don't want to socialize at 90 per cent of social gatherings - for most people, even if they can pretend to accept it for a while, it is a problem in the long run. \n\nThat said, you are absolutely free to live a life how you want to. It's just that you should know that other people can't accommodate exactly how you like. You remind me a lot of my mother- a book and cat loving introvert. She was so resentful when people would ask her to come out and socialize, and it's only now maybe she is realising that this was a her-problem and other people were being reasonable. Over the years this definitely caused a deep fissure in her marriage with my father, and though they never divorced, her being an introvert fundamentally changed my extroverted father's personality and our childhood and it wasn't pleasant. There are natural consequences to this sort of behaviour - ones that you can't fully understand the impact of in your early 30s. But you should know that your behaviour is as absurd to extroverts as their behaviour is to you. \n\nMy advice to you is to redraw your boundaries a bit, and try and truly compromise with your husband instead of my way or the highway. Go to one gathering a month. The kitties will be ok for two hours or so will you. 24-36 hours for a year spent on activities you don't enjoy is a perfectly reasonable compromise for a marriage. If you can't bring yourself to do that, you aren't an asshole, but it's clear that personal comfort matters more than your marriage, and there's a chance of things breaking permanently. I really hope you can figure it out and achieve balance. All the best.", "Welp! Sounds like divorce will eventually be in the future.

If you don't you will start creating a rift in the relationship. They will start to wonder why you don't like them and when you do go see them for Thanksgiving or whatever you can expect to be given a cold shoulder. I have an aunt who was married to a guy who refused to go to any family functions or dinners, the family hated him and they are divorced now.", "YTA. It's not all about you.

Now putting more demands on her is not okay. \n\nMarriage is between them. I am not saying family means nothing, I am saying marriage is primarily between them. He should have stood up for her from the first moment onwards and said she doesn't like to socialise and it gives her anxiety. It's as simple as that.
