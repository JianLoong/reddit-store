Just talk to your wife.", "INFO: Does she do after work drinks with other (female) colleagues?", "The tone of their relationship is what matters. I keep in touch with various past work buddies, men and women, and will go get a drink one on one with people sometimes, and it's not at all a date. If your wife and this guy are flirty at all, which feels likely if they work together all the time and like each other, then yeah this is kind of asking for trouble. If the vibe is extremely platonic and they need to meet up to vent about work and such, and that's their true vibe, maybe trust your wife. Really depends, like what's her take?", "Dude, don't ask reddit just talk to her. Tell her you trust her completely but this is making you uncomfortable and you want to talk about it. Be open with each other and don't be accusatory. It doesn't matter if we agree with you or not, it's about what your wife thinks.", "I think what\u2019s interesting here is that they have been together for 11 years and this is the first time he\u2019s felt something off about a situation. Also strange he hasn\u2019t met this man yet.\n\nHe would be the asshole for trying to forbid it but I\u2019m not sure he\u2019s an asshole because his spider senses are tingling. I\u2019d hope the wife would pick up on that and reassure OP.\n\nAffairs happen. The funny thing is there\u2019s really nothing OP can do either way. She either wants to cheat or doesn\u2019t. His feelings and actions won\u2019t really do anything except drive her away.\n\nOpen ended drink dates can be a little strange. Like they have this need to go out together, alone. Usually this would seem like a good time to invite the husband along to get to know the work buddy better. If they are kept separate, that\u2019s weird.\n\nI\u2019m married and have been in a relationship with my wife for 15 years. We both have friends from opposite sex we hang out with alone. At this point our lives are so intertwined we couldn\u2019t cheat if we wanted. \n\nWhen we first stated dating she did a semester in France. She had a guy in her study abroad classes hit on her pretty heavily a few weeks into them hanging out together. She had previously mentioned him over video chat and talked about some of his actions and I had expressed that I thought he was trying to get in her pants. Turns out I was right. \n\nShe put a stop to him and he had a bit of a nice guy breakdown and caused some issues for her.\n\nI guess my advice to OP is not to hide his feelings but not to be insecure about them either. Don\u2019t forbid the wife(impossible anyways) but make sure your the better catch. Be sure and confident and make sure you sling that weenie right and you won\u2019t have to worry about other guys.\n\nIf you catch her in a lie it\u2019s an entire other story.\n\nNTA, yet, but getting close if you really try to put your foot down. Foot down just means she needs to leave you or lie to you. Don\u2019t do that.", "NAH I\u2019m a woman with many male friends and colleagues and have never cheated. So, I don\u2019t necessarily find anything suspicious about her behavior. But if I were being honest in my heart of hearts, I think it would bother me a little if my fianc\u00e9 wanted to start getting drinks with a coworker. Not that I\u2019d stop him, but it\u2019s something that might make me uncomfortable. \n\nThat said, hitting a happy hour after work is different than going out on Saturday night.

Your wife of 11 years randomly starts wanting to go out drinking with a male colleague, when nothing like this has ever happened before? Anybody who says they wouldn\u2019t be the slightest bit uneasy about this scenario is bullshitting. \n\nAlso, it doesn\u2019t appear like you\u2019re being mean or overly jealous or accusing her of cheating on you. If that were the case then yeah, you would probably be in the wrong. You absolutely have a right to your feelings, don\u2019t let others in this thread tell you you\u2019re wrong for feeling uncomfortable about a situation. \n\nCommunication is going to be key here, just bring it up with her that you\u2019re not very comfortable with this, or ask her if there is more to it - is she mentoring a new employee? She is probably not thinking anything of it, and doesn\u2019t mean to hurt you or make you feel uncomfortable. You should continue to trust her unless she has given you any legit reason not to. Just don\u2019t be controlling.\n\nThis guy probably wants to fuck her though. Js.", "Weirdly, when I look back on my life, I either had a very trusting husband or he just didn\u2019t care.\n\nI had male friends who were musicians who played in local pubs. Hubby would stay home when I went to their gigs - ALONE! He went out with his friend group - ALONE, whilst I stayed home with the children. Sometimes we would get a baby sitter and go out together. I was never worried about Kath or Lyndsey in his darts team, he was never worried about Steve when I went to one of his gigs.\n\nAt one stage, I even joined a (previously) all male pub rock group as their brass section. He looked after our children during practice sessions, but we would sometimes get a babysitter for a gig so that he could come and watch. It just never seemed to be an issue for us.\n\nHas family life changed so much? Or is it just Reddit making me feel weird?", "Need more info.\n\nI\u2019ve had male coworkers-turned-friends whom I have hung out with one-on-one, with nary an ill intention in sight.\n\nBut if you expressed an interest in joining and she shut it down, that would give me pause. \n\nThat being said, did you express an interest in joining them, and if so, what was her reaction?", "INFO: Have you met this person?", "NTA for feeling uncomfortable with it. You're entitled to your feelings. But you would be TA if you just tried to lay down some kind of husband veto law. Remember that it's a good sign that she's even been telling you these things. There's a huge difference between her talking about him and tell you ahead of time that they made plans vs. telling you after the fact, or worse, you finding out after she kept it a secret. \n\nShe's doing the right thing and keeping communication open. Respond in kind. Trust your wife. She has not given you a reason not to trust her, so keep that going.

Going out for drinks with with a new heterosexual friend of the opposite sex definitely feels like a date!\n\nIf I told my wife I was going out for drinks with a woman friend she would no doubt be confused and upset. Different story if she came too I suppose.", "It depends on how much you trust your gf. I have had male coworkers that I would never have any inclinations with, and I hung out with them. If I had any sort of inclinations to one of my coworkers, I would not go out with them and put myself in that position. Do you trust her to be of the same mindset?", "This depends on the nature of your relationship. There are some couples who would never go out with someone of the opposite sex alone for any reason while there are others who are comfortable with their partner hanging out alone with an ex. Is there a precedence for this type of interaction for either one of you? If not then it's probably in your interest to approach her in a non accusatory way and if she is a caring partner, she would give you proper assurance or she would reflect and realize this is inappropriate.", "NTA - Everyone is saying; \u201cyou don\u2019t trust your wife\u201d\u2026he should still voice his displeasure, an uneasy feeling can cause a rollercoaster ride of emotions.", "NAH.

We aren't about making each other jealous or suspicious of infidelity. \n\nReddit seems to lean toward it being okay to have a bff outside of the marriage that is the gender you are attracted to generally, but it's not okay in my relationship and it's okay if you are uncomfortable with it. \n\nThis is a sit down discussion with your spouse about boundaries/respect and what you each are okay with in your marriage.

What's the relationship status of the co-worker?  How does she talk about this co-worker to you?  Does she have other male friends?  Is it normal for her to hang out with male friends one-on-one?  Does she feel comfortable with you having female friends?  Does she feel okay with you hanging out one-on-one with female friends?  Has your wife given you reason to believe she'd cheat?

If yes, how did she react? \n\nNot a problem how you feel about it, but it is a problem if you have a problem with her going in that you ask her not to, so mild YTA for now for lack of information. \n\nI personally think asking your partner not to meet up one on one with a potential friend just cause it is the other sex/gender is not okay. If you can trust them, then it doesn't matter with whom they go out. Of course, if she thinks the coworker feels different about their friendly meet-up and has hopes, this is something she needs to address fast.", "NTA", "NTA. I think you're getting a lot of kneejerk Y-T-A's from people who are used to seeing a male AITA post where he doesn't want his wife to do something with another man. I think the situation here is far more nuanced. First, a heterosexual man in 2023 should be well aware of all of the possible interpretations of asking a married woman who is his coworker to drinks.\n\n If he's interested in a platonic relationship, there are a lot of other activities that he could've suggested. Yoga. Farmer's Market. Hike on the Weekend. Getting a drink is a classic date activity, and yes, it is something platonic friends can do, and perhaps they could do that at some point and you wouldn't feel odd about it, but as a first \"outside of work\" hang out, it's a bit odd. \n\nSecondly, someone in his shoes who is really this interested in a platonic relationship with a woman might say, hey, I'd really love to meet your husband, maybe we can all meet at a bar together? This immediately diffuses the weirdness of the situation, and in the future, given that the initial drink goes well, you probably wouldn't mind if they got drinks together. \n\nA heterosexual male and female coworker friendship is a challenging one to navigate without spouses, so with one, even more challenging. If I were you, I'd probably say sure wife, go ahead, and if he gave her any reasons to think it was more than platonic, then she would probably shut it down, since you trust her and you're in a committed relationship.", "Going out for drinks as just the two of them sounds like a date.  We aren't talking about at a conference on the road grabbing dinner to prep for a presentation or talk through strategy for the business trip.\n\nYour wife is saying she wants to spend personal time with a guy and go drinking.\n\nJust flip the situation around.  How many wives would like their husbands to say, you know that new Italian place, the one you said you wanted to try?

If you really were a controlling AH who didn\u2019t trust his wife you would forbid her from even seeing him while she\u2019s sober, but since that is obviously not the case you only have a problem when your wife won\u2019t be able to think clearly (which is 100% a valid concern).\n\nYour wife\u2019s new \u201cfriend\u201d could easily get her drunk in order to do multiple *weird* things to her without her consent.
