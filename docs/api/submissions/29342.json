Yeah, you could have been kinder to the child, but still you don't have any moral obligation to have a relationship with her. And especially not like this, where she's abandoned with you! Next time call the police and get them to return the child to her mother. NTA", "INFO\n\nHow old are you? Did she just drop her daughter off without permission from your father?", "NTA I feel bad for your sister but this is not two sisters spend time together but free babysitter for your mother. You need to tell your father about this so he can make sure it doesn't happen again. I think your mother might lie to this sister about you want to spend time with her and very happy to have her with you.", "Info:  where was your dad in all of this?", "NTA. Did you tell your dad? Super irresponsible and reckless of your mother to do that when your dad and stepmom were gone the whole weekend! Anything could of happened, she could have choked on food or gotten injured somehow. I would tell her next time she drops her kid off without you and your dad agreeing that you will call the police for child abandonment.", "NTA\n\n but what were the reactions from child and mother to this. did they get the message?", "Call the Police for child abondenment or your Mom will do it every time she wants because your a free Sitter", "INFO\n\nHow old are you? Do you have a license? Have access to a car? Was there no way to take your half-sister and bring her home? Why didn't you call your dad and ask him for help?", "ESH\n\nYour mom is an AH for forcing a relationship you don't want. But you are one for saying that to a 10 year old. That's messed up. That kid did nothing wrong except be born and you hit them with that at such a vulnerable age. \nIn the future when your mom wants a free babysitter,say no,refuse to open the door whatever it takes to avoid this happening again.  You and your mom have your own drama,do not force it on your sister.", "ESH - I understand you have complicated feelings. But your half-sister is just a kid. To her, you were her new big sibling she was excited to meet and get to know. It wasn\u2019t fair of your mom to suddenly spring this on you, but it wasn\u2019t fair of you to tell a child you want nothing to do with her through no fault of her own.\n\nYour little half-sister isn\u2019t included in the ESH, to be clear. Just you and your mom.", "ESH. \"I don't want \\[to\\] do anything with you. I'm just watching you till your mom gets back.\" Fucking harsh thing to say to a kid who obviously looks up to you. I get that this was forced on you, which isn't fair to you either, hence why mom is an asshole too here. \n\nAlso notice you said \"your mom.\" Not \"our mom\" or \"mom.\" You're creating more separation than there actually is. Again, really harsh.", "ESH - You\u2019re mum was completely in the wrong for just dropping your HS on you without any warning. That\u2019s a very impolite thing to do, especially when it seems you don\u2019t want to have a relationship with your mums new family. However that does not mean you should treat the kid that way. You simply do not treat a 10 year old like that. You\u2019re HS had nothing to do with it, your grievances should be with your mum, not her. So in that case ESH", "ESH Your mom shouldn't have just dropped your half-sister off like that. But the kid was probably told you wanted to be her big sibling, and didn't deserve to get snapped at because her mother's an AH. She's 11.", "She\u2019s a kid, so YTAH for treating her like that when none of this is her fault. But your mom is also an AH for crossing your boundaries and just dropping her off.", "NTA", "Yta, get a grip", "ESH- Your mom sucks more than you though, she shouldn\u2019t have forced this relationship onto and forced you to babysit for her. However, what you said to your half sister was incredibly harsh. She\u2019s a kid and probably just looked up to you. The actions of your mom don\u2019t reflect on the kid, so just try to be a bit nicer about it next time.", "ESH. Your sister is a child and it isn't her fault what your mother did. Don't take it out on her. Your mother has no right to try and force anything between you and your half-sister. If your mother pulls that shit again call the police and report her for abandoning a child.", "ESH except the sister. It's not her fault she was forced upon you, but you acted very nastily to a little kid. Your mother should not have dumped her on you. This poor kid; you must have sounded utterly awful.", "ESH except your sister.\n\nIf you'd said that to your mother, that would be one thing.\n\nIt's a pretty heartless thing to say to a ten or eleven year old kid. And honestly, I'm wondering what exactly is going on that your mother *and your father* agreed to have you babysit your younger sister in your father's home. It could be nothing, or there could be some disruption in your sister's home, which would be all the more reason to be considerate of her.\n\nYou need to apologize to your sister. If this should happen again - lie! Tell her you have a ton of homework or something.", "YTA.  \n\nIt's a pretty harsh thing to tell a 10-year-old.  She didn't put herself in that position.  She's as much a victim as you are.", "ESH - Obviously you are NOT an AH for not wanting anything to do with your half sibling. But you don\u2019t have to go out of your way to be mean to her. You should have told your mother that you were calling the police if she didn\u2019t collect her child immediately. You are not a babysitter and she had no right to drop her affair baby off with you at your father\u2019s house.", "You said that to a 10 year old?\n\nYTA - that is incredibly harsh and extremely hurtful.\n\nShe is just a little girl. You can have your feelings but you doing't hvee to be cruel. This child looks up to you. She will never forget your words or her attitude.", "YTA.  Not wanting to know her is fine.  Being cruel to a child who had no say in where she was left wasn't.  Look at it from her perspective.  She doesn't know you.  She can't just leave.  Her mom dumped her with a stranger. She wanted to play, as children do, and was rudely dismissed by the stranger watching her.  Tell your mom if this ever happens again you will call the police for child abandonment.  Be nice to the child while you wait for the police to show up.", "NTA. You can also tell step mom that next time she tries to force babysitting on you, you'll call cps for child abandonment. A child isn't responsible for looking after another child and you don't have to agree to it.", "NTA\n\nNext time, call the police and tell them that your mother abandoned her daughter with you when you're not remotely qualified to take care of children.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
