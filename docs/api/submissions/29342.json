My point was that she should have called him to ask him to speak to her mom for her, which I explained after. Being far away had no bearing. She thought that I meant for her father to come home and take care of it. I did not. A phone call from him likely would solve the issue. It would likely prevent it from happening again even now.\n\nShe said she couldn't drop her at home because they were outside. I assumed she meant out, but the thing is that wouldn't matter. I was asking because there are ways to get someone to come back home. If she had a license and a car, she could pack the kid up and drive to the house. She could text the mom and tell her that she was doing this. She could tell her that if she didn't come home to take the child, that her next call would be the police. Now, that might be more than she was ready to do, but there are plenty of other things that a car and license would allow her to do. Those things would be harder on public transportation, but still doable. In the end, she didn't even really answer that question.\n\nAnd I'm neither happy or sad with her answers. I simply stated that she didn't answer three of them, and the ones she did answer had excuses attached to them and really jumped the gun on where I was going with them.\n\nAnd yes, I agree.

I find their hypocrisy to be hilarious, and I prefer not to take comments like those seriously.

Alas, I doubt any of them will ever admit their poor choice of words, and everyone reading along either didn't care, or agreed with them so they aren't going to step up now.
