I thought A was very cute and caught feelings. Eventually a mutual friend gave me some advice it helped me get the courage to ask A out, she turned me down. Stating being Ace she didn't see the point in dating and couldn't \"give me what I would need in a relationship.\" I accepted her answer and moved on. We still hung out regularly and would have lunch, but both parties paid for their own meals and it was strictly friendly.\n\nRecently I fully got over all the feelings of wanting to date A and was just happy to finally only see her as a friend. A few days ago she approached me while we were hanging out with a large group of our mutual friends and asked to speak with me in private. I agreed and we walked off into another room, where she asked me out. I just stood there for a second and asked A to repeat herself cause I think I misheard her. She again asked me if I wanted to go out on a date with her. I calmly said \"when you turned me down I moved on, I have no desire date you anymore.\" Apparently that was the wrong answer cause a few of our friends are mad at me, even though A seems satisfied with my answer. Am I the asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
