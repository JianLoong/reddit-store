So I don't blame you for wanting to mitigate his pain as much as possible. But indulging him even on a temporary basis can create negative behaviors in your son. As much as we don't want our children to hurt, grief and pain do allow us to cope with loss. We cannot navigate the loss without them. I'm glad that you are getting your son help in the form of therapy. You should look into getting some for yourself. I think you're an excellent parent that's going through Hell. I have no doubt that your son is greatly appreciative of what you are trying to do. I would tell your sister that you appreciate her concern, but she needs to keep her opinions to herself. Making comparisons between your son and her children is not productive. If she's really interested in helping, then she needs to do so without judging you. You're getting counseling and you will listen to their professional opinions over hers. You would like to build a bridge but only if she can agree to leave her suggestions at the door. If she can't do that then you will have to do this without her. Tell your parents the same things. Then firmly keep these boundaries. \n\nI'm truly sorry for your loss.
