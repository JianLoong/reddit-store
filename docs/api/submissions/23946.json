I have no doubt that your son is greatly appreciative of what you are trying to do. I would tell your sister that you appreciate her concern, but she needs to keep her opinions to herself. Making comparisons between your son and her children is not productive. If she's really interested in helping, then she needs to do so without judging you. You're getting counseling and you will listen to their professional opinions over hers. You would like to build a bridge but only if she can agree to leave her suggestions at the door.

My kid doesn't have a mom\".", "I think therapy might help both you and your son navigate this difficult time. But honestly, just asking your son what he needs and talking things over is a huge step.

Take care of that boy.", "NTA.\n\nIf this is your parents and sister's way of \"supporting\" you, then you don't need that kind of support.", "NTA\nYou are doing your best to help your son who has lost his mum while also trying to cope with the loss of your wife.\n\nThe panic attack comment got me though, mate you are doing your best but you sound fragile. Maybe you could get some help to process this, and in turn they could help you with a skill set to help your son.\n\nI'm so sorry for your loss.", "NTA\n\nYour sister was an asshole, and probably a liar given she likely pumped your parents with her spin on the issue. She had no real justification to complain short of concern your son might develop a complex, but honestly if she worded it the way you quoted her actions it sounds more like it came from a place of, \"I can't provide this much for my sons, so it's unfair for your son to have so much.\"\n\nDefinitely talk with a therapist I think, both for you, and for him, because it sounds like you're mentally in a bad place and your sister was just being yet another asshole mother giving unasked for criticism to a single dad.", "NTA. What?! How are your parents not talking to you too?! Your wife just died! Wtf is wrong with them?", "NTA. But\u2026.be careful.  It sounds as if you are trying to use things to fill the hole left by his mother\u2019s death.  I understand your rational but it isn\u2019t a good idea.  He needs the same boundaries and rules he would have if his mom were alive.  The difference is that he needs grief counseling(and so do you).  Your plan sounds like a short term solution that could back fire", "I\u2019m firmly of the belief that it\u2019s only \u2018spoiling\u2019 if it negatively effects their behavior.

You said that and asked to be corrected if you misunderstood. My comment was correcting you because you misunderstood.", "Original comment maker here. 10000000000% misunderstood.

It helped a lot to have places of comfort to disappear into when you needed, and open arms to dive into. \n\nYour sister and parents are cruel. They know your loss and prioritize your sister's rude opinions over your raw emotions. It's the short stick men get, you're not allowed to be sad, and doing your best. Just let it wash over man, it's ok. You are doing what's best for your kid. Protect him, and protect yourself. \n\nMake sure you're getting help with your own grief. Don't let it eat you up while you try to be a rock, because you may just crumble under the strain. Take time to feel. Your grief is valid. Your emotions are too. Hug your son;  you're a good father.

It's obviously NOT your intention, but that's the truth of it.\n\nMy suggestion is to seek counseling for your son (and yourself), to learn healthier methods of grief-healing.  There are free resources everywhere.\n\nMy condolences.", "NTA Your sister had no right. I'm really sorry about your wife. You sound like a great Dad.", "I am so sorry for the loss to your little family.  \n\nI am firmly in the corner that your son needs some spoiling.  Snacks, tv, so what?  It's not like you're getting him a BB gun, 2 puppies, or something.  It doesn't replace his mom but it's a small thing right now.\n\nMy husband lost his dad very early and his family went to the beach every weekend all summer when they couldn't afford it but other family wanted to help the kids feel special.  It was a short time but he remembers this generosity.", "You can't replace a parent with toys or snacks, nor do they ease the hurt. You can't buy grief relief.\n\nI lost my dad at 6. I have been where your son is, I understand your motivation. You are trying to make him happy but going the wrong way about it. His parent has died, there is no toy or snack in the world that will ease that pain all you are doing is creating another problem to solve down the track when you need to ween him off all the gifts.\n\nYou should be focusing on helping him grieve, really grieve not rushing him back to a happy place. Grief is an important part of the healing process after a loved one passed. Your son doesn't need to be happy right now. Your son needs love and support as he comes to terms with the dramatic changes in his life. Creating a new normal of gifts and snacks you will be taking away later is not helping. Happiness returns eventually but you can't rush it or buy it. \n\nMake sure your son has a good therapist and focus on creating the new normal. You sound well-meaning but lost. You want your son to be happy but are trying to cheat your way there through gifts. That doesn't work.", "You need to help him process his grief in an appropriate fashion. Not in a consumerist fashion.

The entire argument was about her being jealous she didn't have the funding/time/etc to get her kids the same things which is entirely her freaking problem.

But I do agree.", "This was my first thought. \n\n\u201cHe might have a lot of toys but he doesn\u2019t have a mom.

Looks like everyone understood it, just 1 or 2 people.", "NTA, send both your sister and parent that visitations will not resume until THEY apologise and hold to it, they don't get anything from you or your son until they admit they were wrong, if they refuse then IMHO its not really that big of a loss.", "Sorry for your loss!\nYour own family not talking to you a few months after losing your wife is just atrocious! The fact it\u2019s also over something that is absolutely none of their business makes it worse! \nKeep doing what you\u2019re doing for your son, you know best.

I am sure the kid would rather have his mom than any of the comfort items and food. Your parents and your sister are not thinking of you 2 grieving and trying to figure out what life is like just the 2 of you. I am so sorry for your loss and just keep doing your best. Your doing good!", "NTA.\n\nNot sure if you\u2019ve explained what happened to your parents, but maybe try a text or email:\n\n\u201cTo clarify, as you know, the past few months have been inexplicably hard. For me and for my son. I have treated him to extra things. That is ok and my prerogative.\n\nSister laid into me and said I was spoiling him, and that it wasn\u2019t fair he had all these toys and her kids did not have those toys.\n\nI tried to explain that for the short term, I am trying to create moments of joy.\n\nShe berated me.\n\nI started to have a panic attack.\n\nWhat I need right now from the whole family is support. \n\nNot criticism because my son has things another child does not, and I cannot handle being yelled at,\n\nThat is reasonable. I need to protect the sense of conflict in the house hold for both myself and my son, and the behavior was out of line.\n\nI hope you can understand that. \n\nI need you right now mom & dad, and this is making a hard time and a hard moment even more difficult.

I'm new :D", "Meh, its reddit, the votes dont really matter, but thanks for the support bruh", "Should have asked her if her kids have a mom. Because yours doesn't.\n\nNTA\n\nBut this is just a temporary solution. You need to get your kid into therapy.", "I am so sorry for your loss. NTA. You don't need that energy around you while you are grieving.", "NTA - I was widowed with three kids. Family thought they could do whatever they wanted. One day I found out my sister in law signed a waiver without my knowledge to have someone \u201cborrow\u201d my 5 yo for a school psychology class. Naturally, the shit hit the proverbial fan. \n\nI ended up moving far away from them. It was hard, but it was the right decision for us.   Stand your ground and never apologize to anyone for taking care of your son as you see fit."]}
