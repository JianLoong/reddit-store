Everything was fine the first day, but the second day she started complaining that I was spoiling my son and her kids don't have this. I asked her what she was talking about and she mentioned how many toys I've gotten him and how I'm letting him have too many snacks. This made me really upset. Obviously I'm not going to do this forever, but my son literally lost his mom a few months ago.\n\nThis started a huge argument between us. She refused to listen to my reasoning and we kept getting madder at each other. Eventually I asked her to leave because I was starting to have a panic attack and couldn't deal with it. She stormed out of there and now her and my parents aren't talking to me.\n\nI don't even know what to think right now. I've been trying to make my son happy, but it's possible I'm going too far.

The way your sister framed it makes her a huge asshole. She wasn\u2019t worried your son might end up spoiled. She was pissed her kids don\u2019t get toys and snacks and attention. Because they still have a mother. Which I am sure you and your son would trade all the toys and all the snacks to have your wife and his mother back. \n\nI would take a ginormous step back from her.

I was ready to defend your sis a little until you revealed that the complaint wasn't cautionary. Meaning, you don't want any child unhealthily dependent on material things. BUT, when it became a comparison to her kids' toys, she completely lost me.\n\nShe's the a-hole for making this about her and her kids. Who cares what they have? The priority should be creating a serene and safe space for you both to mourn, drama free.  \n\nMy heart goes out to you and your son xoxo", "NTA. I can't imagine what you and your son have been through, and on top of that I cannot imagine someone trying to tell you how you should or shouldn't grieve.

I am so sorry for your loss. \ud83d\udc94", "NTA I'm so sorry for your loss. Perhaps ask your silly sister and indeed, your parents,  which they think your boy would prefer - a few snacks and toys or his mum.

A kid losing his mom is just a horrible situation. Doing little things to try to cheer him up is not bad and is not spoiling him. I\u2019m sure he would happily trade the toys and snacks for his mom.", "NAH. You may be indulging your son a little too much and creating expectations in him that his life will be this way forever, overfilled with toys and unhealthy snacks. You might consider bonding him with him and making him happy by doing things together \u2014 hiking, sports, visiting museums, etc. Your sister could have phrased her legitimate concerns more tactfully.", "Your sister crossed a lot of lines in being upset that your son has stuff her kids don't. Her kids have their mother for starters. And your parents not speaking to you after you lost your wife - wow.\n\nBut toys and snacks are not going to fill the void your wife has left. He needs therapy. He needs your time and attention. You cannot replace his mum with stuff.\n\nIt does not make you the asshole for doing your best though. NTA", "NTA - Nobody sucks here. \n\nWell, if you are getting the kid diabetes and teaching him to have no grasp on being told No, yes, you are making it worse in the long run. Buying him a ton of toys may seem like a good idea on the surface, but he is always going to suffer and going to be a little bit sad about mum. There's nothing wrong with grief. It's there for a reason. The fact you reacted so dramatically, panic attack, throwing your sibling out, even somehow managed to involve your parents in all this... you KNOW you over-did it. Whether or not jour sister is jealous because she can't afford the same for her own kids, or if her advice was genuine just poorly formed and you attacked her, doesn't matter. The fact is you two are still incredibly stressed and it may take years to get out of the insane pain you are feeling. These people are not your enemy. It's not you and your boy against the world. Understand your reasoning may not be solid right now. Nobody expects it to be. Your loss was catastrophic. Just ... call her, apologize for the hysterics. Tell her you are doing the best you can. She will help. Your parents will, too.", "You lost your wife and your son lost his mother, but your sister and your parents refuse to speak to you over an argument she caused?
