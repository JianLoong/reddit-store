There is a good male friend I have met twice.\n\nShe asked for permission to smoke up at her male friends house. \n\nI responded saying it was not okay if she got so intoxicated that her judgment was impaired.\n\nHe cooked dinner for her, they smoked weed and she passed out on his sofa.\n\nShe explained that he's just a friend, she does not see him in that way. \n\nI said this was not okay that she was so high she fell a sleep alone at his home.\n\nShe called me controlling and indicating I am a problem for making her feel bad.\n\nThanks in advanced\n\nAddition: Seems like a lot of people think I some how make her report into me her activities.

You can tell her you are very uncomfortable but you cannot stop her from doing it. When you get to that point, you need to leave the relationship.

If someone sexually assaults her, it will never, EVER be anyone's fault except the predator.", "NTA. I don\u2019t get the all the YTA comments. As a young woman, if my friend had a bf and was going to a guy friends house to have dinner and smoke, I would tell her that\u2019s not a good way to keep a relationship or keep yourself safe if it ends in passing out in their couch. I don\u2019t care how good a friend is, you don\u2019t know what could happen if you\u2019re passed out. In my own relationship, my fianc\u00e9 wouldn\u2019t allow that at all and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s controlling bc I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable doing it anyway. \nI get there is a tactful way for OP to explain this and maybe he didn\u2019t do it in the best possible way but I think he did have good intentions when doing it.", "I promise you bro she did a lot more than \u201cpass out on his couch\u201d they fucked bro.", "Dude, NTA, you made your point with her and she ignored it. Warning.... she will keep ignoring your feelings. Time to cut sling load and pop smoke. Find someone who will RESPECT you and your feelings.", "YTA. First of all, a boundary is something you set for yourself, not others. Second, you consider falling asleep after smoking weed having \"impaired judgement\"? How so? Third, if you don't trust her to hang out with her friends, do her a favour and break up with her.", "NAH. I think you will get a lot of flack but a good ole gender reversal thought experiment might open the minds of some redditors. Imagine a woman posting this about her boyfriend who goes over and hangs out with his female friends, gets high or drunk enough to fall asleep around them, are we giving this guy a pass? Yes, it is ok for men and women to be friends, and yes, it is ok for women to smoke weed and get drunk with said men. If OP's boundary is \"it's not okay for her to go out and get intoxicated to the point she passes out or has impaired judgment like pissing in the middle of the street\" her reaction is that is controlling, then she's not ready to be in an adult relationship. \n\nFinally, a personal anecdote, I had a girlfriend in college who had male friends who she would smoke and drink with. I wanted to be who you are all asking OP to be, and I didn't mind. One time, one of these friends called her up late at night and said he was having a hard time, allusions to suicidal thoughts, etc. She goes over to hang out, they smoke, they drink, she falls asleep on his couch. Wakes up twice to him groping her. Sorry folks, but men are often pigs, and I don't think its controlling to say hey I don't want you getting drunk and high and falling asleep and \"guy friends\" houses.", "NAH, just don\u2019t push it to a controlling level. Come from a place of caring instead.", "YTA. A controlling AH at that. Also, I\u2019m literally begging people to stop misusing the word \u201cboundary.\u201d Boundary does not mean rule for other people.", "Yup. Definitely the asshole.", "Sorry bro but they had sex.\n\nShe says they didn't. I said they did.\n\nThe absurdity of this statement is, how would I know? The answer is, I don't and neither do you. Right or wrong it will be on your mind. Don't be gaslighted. Your feelings are valid. \n\nAll that being said. I don't think anything happened. Make better boundaries. Good luck.", "YTA. She doesn\u2019t need your permission to go to a friends house. You are controlling.", "YTA. Next time you,  \"Not all men...\" when a woman brings up toxic male behaviors, consider that you,  A MAN, also don't think any man can be trusted. Which is really freaking gross. \n\nWhen men act this way it makes me question their own motives. Would you take advantage of an intoxicated female friend just because you were presented with an opportunity? If not, why do you assume other men would? And would you even care if this woman weren't your property...I mean, totally equal partner in life?", "NTA. Guaranteed she would not be happy with you spending the night at another girls house. It's not really appropriate behaviour from someone in a relationship. Nothing about trust, I just don't think anyone I know would do it.\n\nI suspect they slept together tbh", "I think it matters the level of friendship she has; I (24f) have a few male friends that ive definitely gotten fucked up with and slept there and never had any issues and my man doesn't give a shit, but these are also friends who I've had since childhood. So you should at least consider that possibility and try to sit down and talk to her, but if it's some Chad she met a couple months ago she's cheating. I ain't ever met a women who goes \"I've know you for 4 months I'll get so fucked up in your house alone with you and sleep there without fearing for my life\", like nahhh\n\nEdit: NTA tho as of know it's not like you've done thing other then be like wtf is this shit which is a fair assessment", "If she doesn't respect your boundaries then she is welcome to leave, nta", "NTA\n\nBro she definitely slept with him.\n\nThere is no such thing as a woman casually smoking weed with another guy. Does this dude have no one else to smoke with? It had to be your girl to smoke with?\n\nYou definitely got played.\n\nWomen have been doing this forever, get free weed and get piped afterwards.", "ESH\nYou had a boundary, she wouldn't respect it. You gotta have trust cuz if you don't then the relationship is gonna crumble. Rationships are built on a basis of 3 things: 1. Trust 2. Respect and 3. Love\nYou gotta trust your s/o to smoke and drink with males and females. She's gotta respect your boundaries. However, your boundary is clearly there from a lack of trust. It's kind of an unreasonable boundary but that's just my opinion. Why don't you trust her? Has she given any other reason other than Falling asleep?\n\nHere is why I ask:\nI had an ex who HATED when I smoked. He said I just wouldn't respond or give him the affection he wanted when I was high. Looking back he's right, I probably did ignore him. I ignored him because he made a big deal everytime I smoked and I had no intention to stop so I did it behind his back. He didn't trust me and rightfully so and I didn't respect his boundary. Thank God things ended. I have a feeling even if the situation is different you'd BOTH be happier if one of you finally walked away.", "NTA. Everyone has their own boundaries and no one should try to shame you if this is one of yours. It would be a deal breaker for me too.", "YTA. \n\nI don't know how many times this needs to be said on this board, but boundaries are something you set for yourself, not someone else.", "YTA\n\nYour girlfriend shouldn\u2019t have to ask you for permission.

They f*cked and she\u2019s lying about it.  She\u2019s feeling defensive about being caught and she\u2019s turning it back in you.  Why didn\u2019t the guy call you to pick her up?  If it\u2019s got feathers, webbed feet and goes quack, it\u2019s a duck.", "YTA for being controlling. It sounds like you don\u2019t trust her.", "YTA. You're dating her, you don't get to micromanage her time with friends. If you can't trust her, whether that's your issue or hers or both, yall shouldn't be dating.", "YTA. So, you have the type of relationship where your independent girlfriend feels she needs to ask your permission to do things as minimal as see her friends? She then proceeded to do exactly that, and instead of putting herself and others in danger by driving incredibly high she took a nap and slept it off. You, by your own word, trust the friend and think he is a good guy. So really what is the logic here beyond not trusting your girlfriend more than a parent trusts their literal toddler?\n\nedit: realised we weren\u2019t given ages here which makes sense seeing as this reads like a high school blog.", "Just the two of them?  Uh huh.\n\nNTA, she can't let go.", "You are clearly not the asshole. If I were you, I\u2019d do the same thing. If she has a problem with you being mad at her for sleeping at another guy\u2019s house, so be it. Just know that you aren\u2019t the asshole in this situation, she is.", "YTA. she's right. you are being controlling. people accidentally fall asleep sometimes, and with weed it can be particularly hard to gauge your limits because different strains affect people so differently. if you're not comfortable dating someone who smokes and/or had close guy friends, you shouldn't be with her", "Crosspost to r/cuckold while you\u2019re at it those guys will get a real kick out of this", "NTA\n\nShe cheated on you.", "YTA. You sound so insecure and don\u2019t seem to understand how weed works", "YTA buddy", "NTA, bro just don\u2019t date girl who get wrecked alone with dudes. Never a good thing. \n\nShe sounds like a degenerate", "Imo NTA. It's more of you guys need to set boundaries that make each other comfortable. That is what a relationship is about. Yes men and women can be friends, but sleeping over at a males alone isn't something I would do, especially intoxicated, without my partner. I would be considerate of my own partners feelings and put his first. But that's just me.", "So if she didn't want your opinion,  why did she ask if it was ok? NTA", "By you saying that she *asked permission,* that makes me want to say YTA. Can you elaborate on that?\n\nBut, I understand this boundary is important and I feel that it isn't unreasonable.

Agreeing on boundaries in romantic and other relationships is fundamental.", "Not much control here if she did it anyway lmao what you talking about", "Right I am so annoyed by ppl on reddit saying that someone breaking a boundary they have not agreed upon is disrespectful. You have to establish a boundary with your significant other and they have to accept it. You can't just be controlling and call it a boundary.", "Not really. He can tell her it's not OK for her to do that if she is in a relationship with him, she can continue to do it if she wants to, and he can say \"well, I warned you\" and walk away from that relationship. Nothing controlling in that.\n\nIt is perfectly OK for your boundaries to be on other's behaviour. It is how you enforce those boundaries and how you respond to them being broken that differentiates between boundaries and controlling behaviour.", "This is exactly what I was thinking too! Not everything is actually a valid boundary, just because that's what you're calling it. Boundaries are about personal standards for what kind of treatment you will or won't accept from others in your relationships. They definitely are NOT some sort of immunity shield, granting you the right to dictate another person's choices. OP can certainly feel however he may about those choices & express that, but that would be a far cry from this gross \"permission\" situation.", "Nah my boyfriend and I \"ask for permission\" to do stuff sometimes it's not that deep at all", "Honestly same, was going to ask how old they are. \u201cAsked to smoke weed with a friend\u201d is weird, and sounds like OP is controlling. Also sounds like OP would be very victim-blamey if something did happen to her while she was intoxicated in any way, especially with a friend he already seems to dislike. OP YTA please do some reflecting and grow up", "Oh no not a male friend!!!! Men and women can have platonic relationships. I have slept over my male friends houses plenty of times because my boyfriend isn\u2019t a controlling asshole.", "I have a friend like you. If he hits the bong he\u2019s falling asleep. No matter what time of day or night.", "And he responds like her father! \u201cI want her to take responsibility for her actions.\u201d My dad has been the ONLY person to say that about me. And he seems to suggest falling asleep on the couch= cheating and that being taken advantage of= cheating.", "That's like, your opinion, man.", "...why?", "Damn dude, are your arms 10 ft poles? Because that was the longest reach I've ever seen", "What an classic r/AITA comment. The reaching from \u201cI don\u2019t feel comfortable with my gf being mentally impaired at her male friend\u2019s house at night\u201d to \u201cI would cheat if I was high or drunk\u201d", "Exactly! The drinking is understandable to a degree but I have smoked until I puke and kept going and I still didn\u2019t cheat or make poor decisions (besides the massive amount of McDonalds lol)", "Ok? But you have to accept that being one on one, drinking/high with a friend of the opposite gender and staying the night typically isn't the sort of thing most people in relationships do, nor would their partner typically find it generally acceptable.\n\nHonestly glad you and your husband are in such a trusting place, but I think you'd accept you're an outlier here.\nI have some great friends who I could hang out with and crash at their house, but I wouldn't because I know their partners might find it a little odd/uncomfortable. It's just not really the done thing is it", "Right? Like the concept of trust in a relationship is so lost on people.", "If she said \"do you mind if I crash here? Been smoking and I'm absolutely pooped. It's just me and [name] which I know is a little weird but I think it's safer than trying to get home\" that's fine. But at the same time if he says it makes him uncomfortable she really should understand that too.\n\nMaybe she did just crash but she should be able to see why OP wouldn't be happy", "I honestly would be surprised that anyone thinks it's in general an appropriate thing to do to spend the night alone with someone else knowing full well your partner isn't comfortable with it.\n\nFriends, plural, sure. One person, at their house, after drinking/smoking and staying overnight without properly running it by your partner? Maybe I'm out of touch, but I would imagine the majority of people would find that inapproriate", "OP not being cool and her liking dudes who party", "She passes out", "I\u2019m sorry but that\u2019s wild. I\u2019m not sure how old you are but sleeping on the couch of a friend of the opposite sex when intoxicated is not and should not be a point of contention in a relationship, that seems like there\u2019s a lot of insecurity there.", "Don't feel guilty and you are a stand up guy. Like seriously, that's awesome to read because it shows there are men with morals and okay for having boundaries!!", "No his response was literally \u201cYou don\u2019t need to ask for my permission for that stuff\u201d. Can\u2019t you fucking read?", "Man, I need to rewatch that movie, I only saw half of it.", "Weed does not affect your judgment like that. Give me a freaking break.", "[AITA users writing their own fanfiction:](https://media.tenor.com/7UarUv_Z1QYAAAAd/gunna-fire.gif)", "She fell asleep. She didn\u2019t pass out. Weed isn\u2019t knocking someone out like that. She also wasn\u2019t impaired - just fed and sleepy.", "No insecurity at all. I have male friends who would call my other half or phone a cab to get me home and vice versa. No secrets, no asking permission. That\u2019s just the way we work together.", "I think you responded to the wrong person. I didn\u2019t mention the permission portion. Can\u2019t you read?", "LOL sounds like a drug addict", "Then why would your partner be uncomfortable if you crashed on a male friend\u2019s couch while intoxicated?", "The permission is a part of the response. So no, he didn\u2019t respond like her father, as he told her she didn\u2019t need to ask permission. Funny how you just ignored that part.", "Sounds like a conservative that\u2019s afraid of a plant.", "I smoke, I like weed. I don\u2019t pretend like people don\u2019t get too high and pass out though", "Getting too high involves dizziness and vomiting, not black outs or other difficult to arouse states. She\u2019s just asleep and can be easily woken. A sober person could be in the same situation, big meal, comfy couch.", "LOL", "Dude, just say you don't understand how weed works."]}
