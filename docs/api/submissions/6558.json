All my clients are private people on their own horses, so I don't give lessons or act as a riding school.\n\nMy long term friend has built an equine center of her dreams which has 2 barns. One barn is for private clients, liveries and her own horses and the other is for riding school horses. Each barn has its own tack room, so barn A has equipment for riding school and barn B has equipment for private horses.\n\nMy friend \"Michelle\" has asked me if I can help her manage barn B for private clients in return to receive discounted livery. She also suggested my clients can also move there, as there were spaces available, which I agreed on. Just to make it clear I didn't receive any money from her for managing the barn, just a heavy discount on the livery for my own horses and I have nothing to do with barn A. I have made it clear that there shouldn't be any unauthorised people in barn B because private horses were stabled there and they are expensive (so no riding school customers), which she agreed on. This agreement has been in place for over a year now. \n\nVery recently I had competitions I had to take 2 of my own horses as well as some clients. The same time Michelle had a big group of clients coming to the riding school (I think it was a school or a birthday party) where Michelle would tell them about horses, let them spend time with them and let some to ride the horses.\n\nI am not exactly sure what happened, but from what one of the private clients said some people from the party managed to get inside our Barn B tack room and destroy some tack (some bridles had headbands ruined, saddles had visable damage and scratches, some pads and bandages were ripped and dirty).\n\nI have brought it to Michelle attention and asked to cover the damages caused by her clients and provide me with cctv from the tack room for the insurance, but she would come with different excuses why she couldn't do that. Just before the new year I have told her that she either covers the damages or me and some of the liviries and clients will leave by mid January and make a claim through our insurance, which will then contact her to recover the losses, since I was not employed by her and she was responsible for the safety at the time.\n\nMichelle said I will be an asshole for doing that as I know she doesn't have that much money and she can't afford a manager on a salary and she will be loosing a lot of money it clients leave.\n\nSo AITA?

I don't have an award, so that's all I can share.\n\nThis answer is the truth.", " I was in 4H growing up and took some riding lessons as a kid, I didn't know about this and I'm curious.  would you mind explaining why using a trained dressage horse for Western trailriding and beginner lessons would be detrimental to the horse's training and possibly their health?", "Bingo", "Electronic door with code for other owners", "Google dressage saddle and prepare for shock and awe. 40 years ago, I paid $1500 for one. \nThey have only gotten more expensive.", "So, I\u2019m a beginner in the horse world, but we\u2019re looking at a new saddle pad. The cheapest is like $60-70. The next step up is about $200. That\u2019s just for a PAD that goes under the saddle. Good quality tack that they\u2019re talking about is gonna be extremely expensive.", "My wife and I just bought her a new saddle. It was $5,000.\n\nIt\u2019s called the sport of kings for a reason. You have to be a king to have the damn budget.", "A LOT. A used western saddle can go for $250+. But English saddles, especially at that level, are typically custom made to the specific horse. The rest of the equipment is also expensive", "Custom saddles from the big name companies are 8-10k. Bridles $500 would be norm. Stirrup leather, $300+, girths $400+.", "It's a common joke - buying the horse is the cheap part!", "Her using the horses for her guests was my first thought. Maybe she didn't have enough horses for that many guests and thought nobody would notice her using the private horses.\n\nBut I can't figure out how the saddles got this damaged. They are after all build to last. Expensive saddles are also usually made from good quality leather. \nHeadbands ripped, is maybe possible from heavy handling. But it depends on the kind of headband.\nWraps dirty, completely understandable. But ripped wraps I can't wrap my mind around. Hell, I've had one of mine once come loose and my horse stepping on it and the wrap barely being stretched out. Maybe the took scissors to everything", "I don\u2019t ride (at this level at least, I\u2019ll recreationally ride western with friends who have horses) but I do work with leather from time to time. A long time ago I asked a friend who rides both once because I was considering acquiring a fairly plain second hand saddle to try my hand at tooling tack and she put it something like \u201ccomparing western to English is a bit like comparing a mason jar to a crystal wine glass. Both are great, both have their uses, but unless you need a fine wine glass you\u2019re probably not gonna use one around here.\u201d \n\nI took it to mean western gear is a lot more utilitarian and sturdy (with probably a lot owing to the weight and the different types of leather used), but also later found out that English saddles aren\u2019t nearly as forgiving for novice riders. When I finally got in and looked at some English saddles I was surprised at the very very different ways that leather is used compared to western saddles. \n\nAlso something I considered: at this level (regardless of if you\u2019re competing Western or competing English) it\u2019s very likely that the saddle and tack is custom made to fit the rider which costs thousands of dollars, and having someone other than the person who the saddle is custom fit to can do damage. I\u2019m far from an expert but that\u2019s kind of what I know. \n\nI definitely agree that OP needs to check every single horse from hoof to head.", "Dressage saddles are made super light for jumping, and they have to be immaculate for competition. It's very easy to ruin one.", "I hadn't considered this. Aren't dressage horses all thoroughbreds? And therefore incredibly expensive? Wow, this really scales up the degree of the offence. Should OP seek legal advice??", "That will certainly happen if her carrier only finds out about the unreported claim from OPs carrier.", "But if the barn owner (who probably let these guests in) also has a code then it doesn't matter if there is a lock or not.\nAnd if it is an electronic lock that logs every entrance then that still wouldn't be of any use. Since the owner would be to only one with access to the data and that would be as effective as the cctv that she doesn't want to hand over", "Google says\u2026. Zoinks! Oh yeah I can see why OP is pissed.", "Paraphrasing, I saw something that said \u201cback in the day, the rich owned a car and everyone else owned a horse (or walked). Now everyone owns a car and the rich own a horse.", "People dont realise the weight behind a leather saddle - dragging it off the rack or off a rail, scraping it on a wall, then dragging the girth and buckles over it... but I've got gear that I've had for over 10 years that doesn't look like that - I'm horrified by what this lot has managed to do!", "Might depend on the age of the group. If it was a group of kids, I could see stuff getting damaged. Especially depending on the age of the kids and the amount of supervision they were under.", "Lol, the mason jar/ crystal glass comparison makes perfect sense, and I kind of figured but it still seems like excessively excessive damage in my mind, well beyond \"we led some kids round on a lead rope for an hour'", "There are different kinds of english saddles. A dressage saddle is heavier and a little bigger than a show jumping saddle, which will have shorter stirrup leathers and a shorter flap. A proper and show-worthy dressage saddle would need to be kept in pristine condition because you are judged on every aspect of your performance, including your tack, you're absolutely right about that.", "A  thoroughbred is a breed of horse. There are several breeds that are used for dressage, mostly warm bloods.", "So of course the customers are happy to use the higher end horses and tack.  The friend was probably doing this for more business.", "And remember too it typically takes weeks if not months to get a new fitter in, make sure it fits the horse, ensure they have the model in stock. And then you have to break in the leather over the course of some very uncomfortable months.", "Even the shoes/boots and pants they wear can cause damage. Any boots with a zipper on the inner leg portion can easily cause scratches or damage a nice leather saddle. When I was riding horses, I would wipe my saddle down after every ride and condition it once a month to keep it clean and supple. I still have my competition saddle and it lives 100% of the time in a saddle bag so it won't get damaged even though I don't ride or compete anymore."]}
