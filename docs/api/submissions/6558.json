I'll try to explain things as easy as I can. \n\nI am heavily involved in equine, dressage specifically. I have my own horses (4) and compete regularly as well as compete my clients horses and ride/train them too. All my clients are private people on their own horses, so I don't give lessons or act as a riding school.\n\nMy long term friend has built an equine center of her dreams which has 2 barns. One barn is for private clients, liveries and her own horses and the other is for riding school horses. Each barn has its own tack room, so barn A has equipment for riding school and barn B has equipment for private horses.\n\nMy friend \"Michelle\" has asked me if I can help her manage barn B for private clients in return to receive discounted livery. She also suggested my clients can also move there, as there were spaces available, which I agreed on. Just to make it clear I didn't receive any money from her for managing the barn, just a heavy discount on the livery for my own horses and I have nothing to do with barn A. I have made it clear that there shouldn't be any unauthorised people in barn B because private horses were stabled there and they are expensive (so no riding school customers), which she agreed on. This agreement has been in place for over a year now. \n\nVery recently I had competitions I had to take 2 of my own horses as well as some clients. The same time Michelle had a big group of clients coming to the riding school (I think it was a school or a birthday party) where Michelle would tell them about horses, let them spend time with them and let some to ride the horses.\n\nI am not exactly sure what happened, but from what one of the private clients said some people from the party managed to get inside our Barn B tack room and destroy some tack (some bridles had headbands ruined, saddles had visable damage and scratches, some pads and bandages were ripped and dirty).\n\nI have brought it to Michelle attention and asked to cover the damages caused by her clients and provide me with cctv from the tack room for the insurance, but she would come with different excuses why she couldn't do that. Just before the new year I have told her that she either covers the damages or me and some of the liviries and clients will leave by mid January and make a claim through our insurance, which will then contact her to recover the losses, since I was not employed by her and she was responsible for the safety at the time.\n\nMichelle said I will be an asshole for doing that as I know she doesn't have that much money and she can't afford a manager on a salary and she will be loosing a lot of money it clients leave.\n\nSo AITA?

Who goes and willfully destroys equipment like that? Like if you have a significant amount of people in your group who apparently care nothing for horses, why would you go to a riding school for a trip?

She shouldn't have allowed a visit by a group too big for her to effectively supervise. She's lucky no kids or horses were hurt.", "Does she not have insurance to cover this sort of thing? That's alarming. Between the negligence and damages, I'd be moving elsewhere too. Definitely make an insurance claim of your own and tell the, there's CCTV and that they will need to contact the property owner. That way no one can claim you altered the footage.

Personally, I think she's covering up something.  You can wait to decide on whether you want to move to another facility, but I would go forward with the insurance claim now.\n\nMichelle should have insurance that covers this - doesn't she?

Horses are very expensive and she built an equine center with 2 barns and she's claiming she doesn't have any money - sorry, but that horse doesn't jump.", "Definitely, NTA. She expects you to lose clients and absorb the $10k in damages?  This is not a way to do business or maintain friends.  I'd reconsider both your friendship and business arrangement as she has demonstrated she is not good at either.", "NTA - she's on the hook for the damages and is using your friendship as a smoke screen as to why she shouldn't have to pay.  None of that matters because at the end of the day, she is the one that is responsible.  The fact that she won't give up the CCTV footage is a massive sign that she's trying to hide what she really did.  You, your horses, and your clients are your priority.  Your friendship doesn't mean anything to your clients.  If you don't do what you have to, your friend will not pay and YOU will be the one losing clients.

If this is true, Michelle should think about that as they make the decisions on what to do.  They allowed their clients to damage property, their insurance needs to pay, or they do.  If they can turn over CCTV footage, the insurance can hold the clients responsible.   \n    \nNo way I would stay at their place if they keep stonewalling and refusing to pay.  Just the damage to your reputation with your clients would make me get out.", "NTA like some other people are saying, you need to immediately remove your horses. Her not letting you see the cctv means that they were likely using the horses for lessons or other stuff. She has NO REASON not to let you see the cctv unless she was doing something shady.", "Nta,  and I would move my horses out either way.    Obviously,  she has no business insurance,  and she is dragging her heels about the cctv, which makes me think that she didn't have it hooked up.", "NTA\n\nHorse tax? \ud83d\ude00", "NTA.

People she was responsible for supervising did a lot of damage. That should 100% be her problem to remedy, not yours.", "NTA. From a fellow horse person your friend is using you. Does your time spent cost = your $ off board? She should have insurance and if she was overwhelmed and understaffed having so many people there that they could have disappeared into the other barn then she has more liability issues than you want to pair to your name. Yikes. And sorry as I would be absolutely LIVID if things happened to my saddle.", "Insurance is part of her cost of doing business. She neither got the insurance nor monitored the tour group, and now she has to pay for her negligence. \n\nNTA", "Is there a way to get the police to request the CCTV footage.", "Pretty sure that there is a bigger problem here.  Either she doesn't have insurance, or she will be shown to have done something herself.  You tried to be nice, so just file that insurance claim, send the footage and let things fall where they may.

NTA", "yeah ex dressage girlie here and i would bet my bottom dollar they didn\u2019t stop at just the tack. they absolutely used the INCREDIBLY expensive, specialty trained LUXURY performance horses for some crappy inexperienced riding school. not only is that dangerous to the health of the horses, but can be extremely detrimental for their long term training. the reason she\u2019s being so squirrelly about the cctv footage is because the tack is just the tip of the iceberg.\n\n\ni would be absolutely livid and pursuing reimbursement to the fullest extent. completely unacceptable behavior for a \u201cprofessional\u201d establishment.", "Because those people didn't just wander in by themselves. They were probably led there by her to show off and probably even let them ride those super nice and super expensive private horses.", "I think the footage for sure shows the friend letting the birthday kids use the private equipment. \n\nI have a feeling if you file a claim the footage will \u201cget lost.\u201d \n\nOP shouldn\u2019t let this go. 10,000 is a lot of money.", "Locking the tack room wouldn't be of much use since her (the barn owners) own horses are stabled in barn B and probably also keeps her tack there.\n\nAnd like others I don't believe for a second that the guests wandered in there by themselves.\nI'm also curious how exactly the managed to actually destroy tack this much", "I wonder if she actually has insurance..  Or what she's hiding by refusing to hand over the CCTV footage.", "Holy fuck. She might have used other peoples horses for her riding lesson clients. I would be furious beyond measure if my very expensive and highly trained horse was used to give lessons to a beginner.", "More likely is that her rates will skyrocket", "Yeah, I am wondering about a lot of that too, the damage to the OP, both reputation and business losses if they stay is very high.  A client expects the facility recommended to be safe for their tack.   \n     \n>  Or what she's hiding by refusing to hand over the CCTV footage.   \n    \nI suspect they were leading, or letting their clients use the horses.  Which is another good reason to get out and let their own insurance take over.", "Yup.  Get the personal relationship out of it and get insurance involved."]}
