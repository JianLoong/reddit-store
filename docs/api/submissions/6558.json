I'll try to explain things as easy as I can. \n\nI am heavily involved in equine, dressage specifically. I have my own horses (4) and compete regularly as well as compete my clients horses and ride/train them too. All my clients are private people on their own horses, so I don't give lessons or act as a riding school.\n\nMy long term friend has built an equine center of her dreams which has 2 barns. One barn is for private clients, liveries and her own horses and the other is for riding school horses. Each barn has its own tack room, so barn A has equipment for riding school and barn B has equipment for private horses.\n\nMy friend \"Michelle\" has asked me if I can help her manage barn B for private clients in return to receive discounted livery. She also suggested my clients can also move there, as there were spaces available, which I agreed on. Just to make it clear I didn't receive any money from her for managing the barn, just a heavy discount on the livery for my own horses and I have nothing to do with barn A. I have made it clear that there shouldn't be any unauthorised people in barn B because private horses were stabled there and they are expensive (so no riding school customers), which she agreed on. This agreement has been in place for over a year now. \n\nVery recently I had competitions I had to take 2 of my own horses as well as some clients. The same time Michelle had a big group of clients coming to the riding school (I think it was a school or a birthday party) where Michelle would tell them about horses, let them spend time with them and let some to ride the horses.\n\nI am not exactly sure what happened, but from what one of the private clients said some people from the party managed to get inside our Barn B tack room and destroy some tack (some bridles had headbands ruined, saddles had visable damage and scratches, some pads and bandages were ripped and dirty).\n\nI have brought it to Michelle attention and asked to cover the damages caused by her clients and provide me with cctv from the tack room for the insurance, but she would come with different excuses why she couldn't do that. Just before the new year I have told her that she either covers the damages or me and some of the liviries and clients will leave by mid January and make a claim through our insurance, which will then contact her to recover the losses, since I was not employed by her and she was responsible for the safety at the time.\n\nMichelle said I will be an asshole for doing that as I know she doesn't have that much money and she can't afford a manager on a salary and she will be loosing a lot of money it clients leave.\n\nSo AITA? I feel kinda bad, however the amount of damage done is quite significant (10k+)", "created_utc": 1672934863, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1042ouk/aita_for_telling_my_friend_she_has_to_pay_for_the/", "score": 114, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't even see how she has the audacity to claim you would be the ah here. Just give you the cctv footage so the insurance company can recover the money and be done with it. Unless she was somehow involved. Which means she's trying to cover it up and hope you will cover the losses.", "NTA, you asked politely, now its time to ask more forcefully and that is what you plan to do. I know how much equine equipment costs and this is just so bad of her. I'm of the opinion: if you can't pay it in one instance, ask for a payment plan.", "NTA. Her party. Her guests. Tack is expensive and a horse person should understand and feel terrible about it.  The people she invited shouldn\u2019t even be invited back to her own place. \n\nYou need a lock on your tack room door going forward.

Basic etiquette would say that she should cover those costs. It would be reckless of you to board your horses at a place that treats peoples' property with such disregard.", "NTA, this business model is a bit worrying, michelle should be seeking compensation from the party, or have her insurance to cover damages.

It\u2019s not your fault.", "NTA...and this is a business she is running.  If you stopped paying she would expect  you to leave.  She needs to run it like a business and get control before she loses everything.  There is a reason she doesn't want you to see the video.  I would also get the police involved- they can force her to hand over the video.  If she hasn't already gotten rid of it.", "You are NTA, you don't have a choice in the matter. The only AH here is Michelle for refusing to cover damages that she (and/or her guests) is responsible for.\n\nI'd suggest you find a new place no matter how she handles this, as similar things will probably happen again under her watch.", "\"she can't afford a manager on a salary\"\n\nNTA  If she can't afford the employee she needs, then she is not running a sound, self-sustaining business.  This is her problem.  Protect your things AND your horses from her bad clients.  Move on.  And make sure you get your $10k", "NTA it might be safe to say, your friend knows exactly what happened. It is possible she allowed those people in Barn B. I think you need to stand by your decision to leave, and you should be prepared to loose this friendship.", "NTA  She is stonewalling because she almost certainly let the people in to use your shit and probably ride your horses too.  Otherwise she would have no problem giving you cctv footage and client names.  She is running a business, she should have insurance for the hundreds of thousands of dollars of other people's valuables that are in her keeping.  If a customer vandalizes something you make them pay for it and call the cops if they don't, you don't cover for them.", "NTA", "NTA never mix business and friendship.

Do what you gotta do and your friend is just going to learn a hard lesson", "NTA\n\nShe is leasing space to private owners and the private owners possessions were damaged under her watch.    \nSounds like some of her public clients got into the private barn unsupervised or poorly supervised.
