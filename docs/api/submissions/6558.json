All my clients are private people on their own horses, so I don't give lessons or act as a riding school.\n\nMy long term friend has built an equine center of her dreams which has 2 barns. One barn is for private clients, liveries and her own horses and the other is for riding school horses. Each barn has its own tack room, so barn A has equipment for riding school and barn B has equipment for private horses.\n\nMy friend \"Michelle\" has asked me if I can help her manage barn B for private clients in return to receive discounted livery. She also suggested my clients can also move there, as there were spaces available, which I agreed on. Just to make it clear I didn't receive any money from her for managing the barn, just a heavy discount on the livery for my own horses and I have nothing to do with barn A. I have made it clear that there shouldn't be any unauthorised people in barn B because private horses were stabled there and they are expensive (so no riding school customers), which she agreed on. This agreement has been in place for over a year now. \n\nVery recently I had competitions I had to take 2 of my own horses as well as some clients. The same time Michelle had a big group of clients coming to the riding school (I think it was a school or a birthday party) where Michelle would tell them about horses, let them spend time with them and let some to ride the horses.\n\nI am not exactly sure what happened, but from what one of the private clients said some people from the party managed to get inside our Barn B tack room and destroy some tack (some bridles had headbands ruined, saddles had visable damage and scratches, some pads and bandages were ripped and dirty).\n\nI have brought it to Michelle attention and asked to cover the damages caused by her clients and provide me with cctv from the tack room for the insurance, but she would come with different excuses why she couldn't do that. Just before the new year I have told her that she either covers the damages or me and some of the liviries and clients will leave by mid January and make a claim through our insurance, which will then contact her to recover the losses, since I was not employed by her and she was responsible for the safety at the time.\n\nMichelle said I will be an asshole for doing that as I know she doesn't have that much money and she can't afford a manager on a salary and she will be loosing a lot of money it clients leave.\n\nSo AITA?

Maybe she didn't have enough horses for that many guests and thought nobody would notice her using the private horses.\n\nBut I can't figure out how the saddles got this damaged. They are after all build to last. Expensive saddles are also usually made from good quality leather. \nHeadbands ripped, is maybe possible from heavy handling. But it depends on the kind of headband.\nWraps dirty, completely understandable. But ripped wraps I can't wrap my mind around.

Both are great, both have their uses, but unless you need a fine wine glass you\u2019re probably not gonna use one around here.\u201d \n\nI took it to mean western gear is a lot more utilitarian and sturdy (with probably a lot owing to the weight and the different types of leather used), but also later found out that English saddles aren\u2019t nearly as forgiving for novice riders. When I finally got in and looked at some English saddles I was surprised at the very very different ways that leather is used compared to western saddles. \n\nAlso something I considered: at this level (regardless of if you\u2019re competing Western or competing English) it\u2019s very likely that the saddle and tack is custom made to fit the rider which costs thousands of dollars, and having someone other than the person who the saddle is custom fit to can do damage.

My sister did it for much longer than me and eventually was experienced enough to use him in her lessons. All was well.\n\nThen our usual instructor was sick one day and a much younger instructor took my sister's class for the day. It was a group lesson with a mix of personal and school horses, with young riders of various levels of ability. This lady had thus far only taught the super basic classes on the very patient school horses. She decided to have everyone switch horses. This can be a good exercise, since it gives the riders a feel for how each horse can behave and respond differently. However, it's only **ever** done with school horses. This instructor had never worked with my sister or our horse before. But she recognized he wasn't one of the school horses.\n\nSo a very new rider ended up on a horse that was almost exclusively trained to knee commands, which she wasn't used to. He also had a soft mouth. He wouldn't respond to the reins because he was getting too many conflicting commands. He was also getting visably annoyed by her clumsy attempts to steer him. She panics, accidentally gives him a knee cue to go into a gallop, which he does, and she crashes him into a fence. The horse's leg was badly injured, and it wasn't clear for a few days if the injury was bad enough that he might need to be put down. We were furious. \n\nOver $50,000 worth of vet bills and months of rehabilitation later, that competition winning horse was able to be ridden again, though he never showed again. The school paid for part of the bill, the young instructor paid another part of it, there was insurance on the horse that covered part, but there was still thousands of dollars left to cover. I don't recall seeing the instructor again, so she might have been let go after this incident. Or just barred from teaching. \n\nSo yeah. Don't fuck around with someone else's horse. If the barn owner is being this cagey, then there's probably more than just some tack destruction on the tape. Or maybe shows her in the private barn with the group, so they didn't 'sneak off' like she says.\n\nETA: I got so angry remembering about my horse that I forgot to mention the young lady that was riding him. She broke her arm after getting thrown when he hit the fence. We never placed any blame for the accident on her. She and her parents placed no blame on us or the horse. It was like putting her in a high-performance race car when she'd only driven go-carts.

My older horse was much more a lesson horse and perfect for when I was learning to ride (she mostly ignored me until I figured out what I was doing); my pony was much more temperamental but I could give complex and subtle directions by moving my feet less than an inch in any direction and she'd respond.

She was thought to be able to handle our horse, how ever incorrect that thought was. \n\nThese kids are not riders, and since we haven't heard of any being thrown, kicked, or otherwise injured, I would assume any horse they rode would be on a lead line or have a handler walking the reins. Letting a total novice have free rein during a demo ride is a horrible thought. Which means the barn owner or one of her hands had to be involved with all rides, whether it was the school horses or the private ones. \n\nPlus, if for some reason kids did just destroy the tack, why is the barn owner not handing over the video? The tack is broken, the event she hosted is clearly the cause. She's already probably liable for the damage just on that, unless specific damage can be traced to a specific kid. If the video shows kids trashing tack, that just proves her story, and there isn't a great reason to withhold it. If it shows more, like the tack was damaged while being used on either the personal horses or the school horses, it's a different story.
