{"id": 10096, "submission_id": "113occp", "title": "AITA for buying my girlfriends sister a car?", "selftext": "About four years ago my girlfriend and her younger sister had a huge falling out. I don't know what about because my girlfriend never went into any specifics and that was before I even met her but they haven't spoken to each other since. I've been with my girlfriend for two years. About a year ago her sister reached out to me because she wanted me to persuade my girlfriend into meeting with her because she wanted to reconnect but when I told my girlfriend she said she never wants to see her.\n\nTwo weeks ago her sister messaged me again and asked me if she could borrow 2 grand from me because she needed to buy a new car and she said she'd pay my back monthly. I told her that I can't just borrow her money because I don't know her and I don't know if she's actually gonna use it to buy a car. But I told her that if she found a car for sale she wants I can go and see it with her and pay for it. So a couple days ago I met up with her and I paid just over 2 grand for a car. This was the first that I actually met her in person. I told her she could just pay me back whenever. I honestly just felt a bit sorry for her, I could tell she genuinely wants to reconnect with my girlfriend but she just refuses. Her sister also didn't tell me any specifics about their falling out but that it had to do with my girlfriends old boyfriend and how my girlfriend basically accused her of doing something she didn't do. I didn't press her for anything specific because I could tell she didn't want to talk about it. \n\nAfterwards I told my girlfriend about it and she got furious at me. She said I shouldn't have bought her a car and she claims I betrayed her trust by going behind her back. We argued about it for a while and well since then she barely speaks to me. But I honestly don't think I did anything wrong, especially since we don't share finances so I spent my own money and not hers. So was AITA?\n\nI don't know if ages are relevant here but I'm 27, my girlfriend is 25 and her sister is 19", "created_utc": 1676546557, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/113occp/aita_for_buying_my_girlfriends_sister_a_car/", "score": 76, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I can provide a sob story too if that helps.", "Can i also have a car lmao", "Boundaries dude, you need a refresher.\n\nYou as a 27 year old man should not be going behind your girlfriends back and contacting her estranged teen sister, let alone buying her a car. \n\nCreepy, inappropriate and downright weird as hell.\n\nYTA", "YTA.\n\nYou literally preface this by saying that you don't know why your girlfriend and her sister fell out. It sounds like you're stepping pretty far out of line by playing the role of a middleman.\n\nAs someone whose spouse isn't connected to most of his immediate relatives, there isn't a chance in hell I would ever do anything like this. Loan money to someone related to my husband who my husband isn't even talking to? Try to pressure him into talking to them? Firm no. If someone reached out in that context, I would be having an open conversation with my husband about what he wants and prioritising his needs.\n\nYou literally don't know the ins and outs of what occurred in their relationship, but for some reason you've decided you really pity the sister she's not connected to. People don't generally block their family for small reasons and it's worth really remembering that. You also don't know whether or not the sister is lying to you if this is tied to her presence in one of your girlfriend's past relationships. You also have to consider that, if this is tied to a past relationship, her sister messaging **you** could really push your girlfriend's buttons.\n\nIt's quite strange that you're trying to play some sort of saviour-type role in this situation. Your girlfriend doesn't owe her sister anything. You don't know any of the facts. Stay out of it.

That's crazy. Even lending her the money is crazy. And then told her after the fact, what you did. You knew she wouldn't be happy about it. That's why you didn't tell her BEFORE you did. You knew what you were doing wasn't right. \n\nYou basically said that you don't care about your gf's feelings or how whatever happened affected her, and that you don't respect her wishes.

Your gf and her sister have no contact you don't know the details of why. Sure I understand it would be nice if they reconnected and you've passed along the message that the sister wanted to.

If she doesn't have a relationship with her sister then you don't either; it's not even like you dated before they fell out and therefore already knew the sister.\n\nWhat you did was unsupportive and plain weird and you really should have come to this realization on your own.", "Nta.

You have no right to have a relationship with someone from your gf\u2019s family that she has no relationship with. If it was your wife and you already know each other, okay.

Also you can kiss that 2 grand goodbye. Don't you think its suspicious that she wanted to reconcile with your gf just in time when she needed money?", "This is so bizarre.. just, why?", "[removed]", "YTA. Are you ****** her sister slept with her ex boyfriend. Rather than respecting your gf you went behind her back and bought her sister a car. She wanted. She wasn't looking to reconnect.

Whatever did happen back then will absolutely come back around on you.", "Yeah you crossed a line that will most likely never be forgiven. \n\nI think you know that, who doesn't. \n\nI wonder if this has been the plan all along. Just know if you are thinking of getting together with her it will fuck up many relationships. \n\nDo the right thing and move on,\n\n and be cool when you do. \n\nAt least that will be a noble act.", "YTA. This is very weird behavior.", "YTA -Hope it was worth it to you to likely have severed any hopes of there ever reconciliation between your GF and her sister, and any trust that remained in your relationship with your GF. So many lines crossed there, and WOW, I am surprised if your GF even stays with you after doing something like that. I honestly have to wonder if this post is even real, as that is just so ridiculously bad, it is baffling that anyone would actually do something like that.", "YTA.
