I don't know what about because my girlfriend never went into any specifics and that was before I even met her but they haven't spoken to each other since. I've been with my girlfriend for two years. About a year ago her sister reached out to me because she wanted me to persuade my girlfriend into meeting with her because she wanted to reconnect but when I told my girlfriend she said she never wants to see her.\n\nTwo weeks ago her sister messaged me again and asked me if she could borrow 2 grand from me because she needed to buy a new car and she said she'd pay my back monthly. I told her that I can't just borrow her money because I don't know her and I don't know if she's actually gonna use it to buy a car. But I told her that if she found a car for sale she wants I can go and see it with her and pay for it. So a couple days ago I met up with her and I paid just over 2 grand for a car. This was the first that I actually met her in person. I told her she could just pay me back whenever. I honestly just felt a bit sorry for her, I could tell she genuinely wants to reconnect with my girlfriend but she just refuses. Her sister also didn't tell me any specifics about their falling out but that it had to do with my girlfriends old boyfriend and how my girlfriend basically accused her of doing something she didn't do. I didn't press her for anything specific because I could tell she didn't want to talk about it. \n\nAfterwards I told my girlfriend about it and she got furious at me. She said I shouldn't have bought her a car and she claims I betrayed her trust by going behind her back. We argued about it for a while and well since then she barely speaks to me. But I honestly don't think I did anything wrong, especially since we don't share finances so I spent my own money and not hers. So was AITA?\n\nI don't know if ages are relevant here but I'm 27, my girlfriend is 25 and her sister is 19", "created_utc": 1676546557, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/113occp/aita_for_buying_my_girlfriends_sister_a_car/", "score": 1531, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I can provide a sob story too if that helps.", "Can i also have a car lmao", "Boundaries dude, you need a refresher.\n\nYou as a 27 year old man should not be going behind your girlfriends back and contacting her estranged teen sister, let alone buying her a car. \n\nCreepy, inappropriate and downright weird as hell.\n\nYTA", "YTA.\n\nYou literally preface this by saying that you don't know why your girlfriend and her sister fell out. It sounds like you're stepping pretty far out of line by playing the role of a middleman.\n\nAs someone whose spouse isn't connected to most of his immediate relatives, there isn't a chance in hell I would ever do anything like this. Loan money to someone related to my husband who my husband isn't even talking to? Try to pressure him into talking to them? Firm no. If someone reached out in that context, I would be having an open conversation with my husband about what he wants and prioritising his needs.\n\nYou literally don't know the ins and outs of what occurred in their relationship, but for some reason you've decided you really pity the sister she's not connected to. People don't generally block their family for small reasons and it's worth really remembering that. You also don't know whether or not the sister is lying to you if this is tied to her presence in one of your girlfriend's past relationships. You also have to consider that, if this is tied to a past relationship, her sister messaging **you** could really push your girlfriend's buttons.\n\nIt's quite strange that you're trying to play some sort of saviour-type role in this situation. Your girlfriend doesn't owe her sister anything. You don't know any of the facts. Stay out of it.

That's crazy. Even lending her the money is crazy. And then told her after the fact, what you did. You knew she wouldn't be happy about it. That's why you didn't tell her BEFORE you did.

Of course it is your money, however, those types of gifts are generally reserved for love interests, not just things you go around doing.

If this happened 4 years ago her sister was 15 and she was 21 so if anything did happen between sister and boyfriend. Her sister wasn\u2019t even able to consent because she was a minor and I\u2019m assuming the boyfriend was not. I feel like that needs some investigation on it own. \n\nBut YTA still. It could be quite possible that her sister might be somewhat innocent but you sir had no right to decide that and over step like you did.

The *only* scenario in which you _might_ not have be an AH is if you already a long standing, independent relationship with her sister. \n\nYou massively stepped over a boundary.

She's very much a victim in such a scenario and your GF needs to wake up to that.\n\nIf she didn't do something, and it's just an accusation by you GF then you're GF is entirely to blame.\n\nYes, you broke boundaries, but they're not there out any legit wrong doing by the sister.", "YTA\n\nIf girlfriend is no contact with her sister, you definitely should be no contact with sister.  You fucked up majorly.  Get your money back and block her, dumbass.", "YTA. HUGE betrayal here, and for what? A person you don\u2019t even know.

A 27 yo secretly buying a 19yo you barely know a car what could go wrong. \n\nYour gf has boundaries and you broke them. You know the issues between them had to do with her sister and her ex bf. Her sister secretly messaged you and keeps in contact with you.. it gets to a point where you secretly meet up with her and also buy her a car. If the sister genuinely wanted to reconnect, she would not be messaging her sister\u2019s bf when the fallout had to do with her coming between/over stepping boundaries with a previous boyfriend. It\u2019s extremely weird how much you\u2019re siding with your gf\u2019s sister over your gf in this mess between them. Which one are you dating? \n\nBtw can I have a free 2k too?

She may never trust you again.", "YTA how did someone convince you to buy them a car and you don\u2019t even know them? Money please!

On top of your girlfriend not wanting to have her sister in her life! You blew through some major boundary here. So inappropriate on many levels.", "YTA because you have no idea why your gf has cut contact with her sister. People tend to cut family members out for a good reason and if your gf is not ready to disclose that reason to you then you should have minded your own business. \n\nI also find it really weird that her sister messaged you asking to borrow money. You didn't know her and she didn't know you, but she felt like it was appropriate to contact her estranged sister's boyfriend to ask for money? And you felt like it was appropriate to not tell your girlfriend? Have you considered that you might have been played like a fool? You have no clue if what sister told you is even partially accurate. The only reason you even know her is because she decided to hit you up for money so she definitely has a motivation to feed you a believable, sympathetic, story. Maybe she was telling the truth, who knows. I hate to tell you, though, that normal people do not ask strangers for money, especially that much money. \n\nHonestly, this might be breakup-worthy behavior. Not only did you violate a boundary your girlfriend had, but you secretly were in contact with her estranged teen sister and hid it from her. I'm struggling to understand how you think you didn't do anything wrong.", "YTA and it\u2019s bordering on weird. \n\nJust an additional reason YTA, grammatically you \u2018lend\u2019 money to somebody who \u2018borrows\u2019 from you.

I appreciate that by pointing this out I\u2019m becoming the AH.", "Yta im sure you view yourself as a nice guy but guys like you just go around hurting everyone they meet by doing things that are clearly inappropriate because you wanna save the day. No regard whatsoever for your partner. I hope your gf leaves you cause this is going to escalate. Buying a car for someone you don\u2019t know is insane and the fact that you see no problem with that is even worse.", "Idiot.\nYTA", "Yta. Dude it\u2019s obvious the younger sister was accused of messing with your gf ex boyfriend or crush. Sisters don\u2019t just fall out over borrowed clothes or makeup. Im guessing they don\u2019t share the same mom and dad because how can they not see each other on holidays for the 2 years you known your gf? Who did the sister live with and did you not visit the parents house?", "YTA you did everything wrong.", "This is gross & YTA.  After the initial refusal most people's response would be to say I'm respecting my girlfriends wishes & won't be responding again. Your response is to not only reply but meet her & give her a sizable amount of money. What need in you did this whole thing meet? I'd be disgusted by your behaviour & then that dismissive attitude.", "YTA for getting into any time of relationship with the sister. But it\u2019s also an idiotic thing to do.", "YTA.  You crossed a boundary and did it behind your girlfriend's back.  Very disrespectful and intrusive.  I would not stay with you if I were her.  Don't pretend that you don't know what you did.", "Yta. Why you trying to fuck her sister?", "Yta", "Jeez, what are you trying to do, sleep with her sister or something? Because I don't understand why you'd buy a car for a stranger who your girlfriend doesn't want in her life. YTA", "YTA! Stay in your lane dude!", "YTA, it would be one thing if your girl hadn't said anything, but she told you specifically not to do anything with her sister. People don't just cut people out for no reason. You betrayed her and her trust. Going forward if she decides to stay with you, she might just be questioning everything you do or say. The trust there is gone.", "YTA. If I were your girlfriend I\u2019d never talk to either of you again", "YTA-  there no reason for you meet her and hiding from your gf.", "YTA, boundaries were pushed beyond just talking to her sister,  but like buying her a car. You can force your GF to interact with her sister...but now she is going to have to either deal with this money exchange or move on. \n\nWhen she says she doesn't want anything to do with her sister, she means it. It's up to her to want her sister in her life. Not you.", "So, this is your story. Your gf has a falling out with her sister. It has something to do with gf's old bf. The sister says that nothing happened and doesn't want to talk about it. And, for some reason, you believe sister and not your gf.\n\nNow, the same sister has been contacting current bf (aka you) for the past year. Giving you a sob story. You are keeping this contact from gf. You buy sister a car. (Don't fool yourself, you're not getting that money back. Did you also buy insurance? Pay for the tax and title?)\n\nI feel very sorry for the gf. She has terrible taste in partners.", "YTA and possible an idiot who buys a total stranger a car? You need a refresher on BOUNDARIES so you can see clearly how much you stepped on hers.", "And to piggyback on others, you're not talking to her sister (another woman) behind your partner's back.

YTA", "Yeah you'll probably be single soon this was a heavy overstep in boundaries. Regardless of whether the sister says she didn't do it or not it sounds like she probably did cuz why would she reach out to you when she has no connection to you and then you go and buy her car. Wow dude I don't know what the hell is wrong with you. YTA", "In what realm of reality do you reside in that you felt like ANY of this was appropriate?!?!\n\nJesus Christ, YTA!!", "YTA", "YTA, but more importantly, you don't \"borrow\" someone money...you \"lend\" it to them.", "YTA.  I'm glad you've got enough extra cash that you can give random people $2000, but that money probably would have been better spent being donated to a foodbank.  \n\n\nI think your relationship with the gf is over, but I'm sure the younger sister will be willing to take you for a ride as long as you're paying for it.", "Dude are you dumb?!\nYou have no respect for your gf's boundaries and doing this behind her back as well... No, just no. I hope she leaves you tbh. You are such an AH.", "YTA. The sister wants to \"reconnect \" with your girlfriend at the same time she needs $2000? You didn't find this suspicious!?", "YTA \n\nNo explanation needed.", "Huge YTA...I would break up with you because you seem to have no respect for boundaries.  You knew your girlfriend was estranged from her sister, it was reinforced a year ago when sister contacted you to try to force a reconciliation.\n\nNow a year later she is asking you(a stranger) for money and you decide it was cool to meet up and give it to her. Were you talking to her for a whole year prior to this because who just asks a stranger for money and who agrees to it. \n\nYou completely betrayed your GF's trust and think you did nothing wrong. Hope she wakes up and breaks up with you.", "Who the hell buys some random people 2k cars??", "YTA! I would have dumped you and pretend we never met!", "YTA \n\nYou are in communication with someone your gf has stated repeatedly is not allowed to be involved in her life. That should have been enough information for you to know that by default the sister is not to be in your life. \n\nNow not only have you been in repeated contact with the sister you have tied her to your life for a non specific time frame via a car loan. Indirectly tying the sister to your gf. Which she has repeatedly and directly told you she does not want. Your actions do not show any regard and little respect for your gf. Are you sure you love her? Your actions say you don't.  \n\nIt is good to hear you and gf have seperate finances already. Will be easier to seperate the relationship since you do not understand boundaries and do not respect your gf. Hope your new friendship with the sister is worth losing your gf.", "YTA. That would be the end of the relationship for me.", "I'm your girlfriend's long lost step brother. I want to get back in her life and reunite our family, including our little sister. Please DM me to get my info to send me 2 grand for reasons.", "Yta. I do think the real reason you went to meet with the sister was to get answers to why the estrangement happened. You still shouldn't have given her 2k for a car.", "YTA\u2026 Your gf went NC with her sister for a reason but yet you went behind her back and betrayed her\u2026 But yet you think what you did was just fine\u2026. I hope she breaks up with you", " YTA. Your girlfriend clearly doesn\u2019t want any contact with her and you bought her a car without speaking to your gf first!

You don\u2019t know her and don\u2019t owe her anything!", "I find it incredibly odd that you would just so willingly spend $2000 on someone you don't know anything about. That's the weirdest thing about this. Hell she isn't even your family since you guys aren't in laws or anything like that.\n\nUltimately the beef your gf and her sister had aren't any of your business. So I don't really think you \"betrayed\" her trust. You just know they had some issue. NTA.\n\nHowever, like I said above, it's extremely weird that you just gave her that money.

Good maybe,but not wise.", "YTA Why would her sister come to you for such a big ask when she's never met you? When your girlfriend has told you they don't speak? This is super weird, dude.

If I were you I'd get the money back asap", "YTA. I'm honestly trying to comprehend this. You just used 2k to buy someone you don't know a car.

That should have been it for you. She does not want to talk about it. That should have been it for you. Do you ever think this is how it started with her ex-boyfriend?

You knew she wanted nothing to do with her sister. Then you go *behind her back* talking to her sister. If that wasn't bad enough you buy this chick a CAR!!! Now, here you are, taking the sisters word for what happened between them and believing that she's innocent even though you don't have any details.  And despite the fact that you haven't even heard your GIRLFRIEND'S side of the story. Why on earth would you believe someone you just met over your own girlfriend?!? The sister is obviously trying to cause problems in her sister's relationship and you just walked right into it. Are you going to sleep with her too? Because she's going to hit on you at some point, guaranteed. She's going to try to spend as much time as she can with you, make you feel sorry for her, then start subtly flirting. Then the flirting won't be so subtle. But she'll pretend like it's so surprising and that she's trying to fight it because she respects her sister.  This of course will all be lies because this is all part of her plan. \n\nYTA. And an idiot for falling for it.", "Half way through I figured it had something to do with an ex. Then you confirmed that suspicion for me. You did, likely, a very similar thing that someone did to your girlfriend and betrayed her trust. That poor girl is going to dump you, and will probably never trust another guy again. \n\nYTA", "YTA Wow so you lost a girlfriend and 2 grand. Goodluck getting any of them back.", "YTA", "I think you meant well, but it didn\u2019t land well. You went behind her back and you\u2019re not even married to this woman. She could break up with you and that\u2019s that. I think you\u2019re in the wrong here.", "Ok, well this is a very weird post. YTA.", "Wow! YTA! You went behind her back.", "why would you buy someone you\u2019ve never met a car? but YTA, because you shouldn\u2019t be stomping on boundaries your girlfriend set with her sister.", "Right so I\u2019m getting that she slept with the ex bf and now your messaging her, meeting her secretly and spending nearly 2 grand on her? You\u2019ve crossed a boundary you aren\u2019t ever coming back from. You\u2019ve destroyed that trust. Good luck YTA OF COURSE.", "You are a complete weirdo, you are also TA.", "Whether you're the AH or not has been covered by others.

You knew it was about the ex BF, didn\u2019t know the circumstances and was in contact with sister.  The sisters relationship is now worse. You have no idea what happened.

Yeah you can post this story but bud we both know your real motives", "Meh, NTA, your money, your business, if you wanted to buy a homeless dude a car same dif IMO. You didn't make them meet or anything. You didn't set up some scheme to try to get them to reconnect. You just meet a stranger and bought her a cheap car. Your business.  \n\nThat being said if your gf wants to break up with you after this then, well, that's her business.", "YTA.  Your girlfriend told you it had something to do with an old boyfriend.  RED FLAG, DUH, you don't think it's strange that the estranged, younger sister goes behind her sister's back and ask you directly for money?  This seems to be the trend with the younger sister and her sister's boyfriends.  How do you know it never happened?  Seems baby sister has been successful; With your gullibility and her deviousness, she has driven a wedge in your relationship.  Damn, you can't fix stupid!", "YTA wtf", "YTA. \n\nThe sisters had a falling out because of a breach of trust around your SO's ex, and you took it upon yourself to DO IT AGAIN????", "How much do you wanna fck a 19 year old, OP? \ud83e\udd22", "YTA and I don't understand how you didnt see the connection that when trying to reconnect with your girlfriend didn't work she asked you for money. She was trying to get back in contact for money in the first place. You can't be that daft", "YTA\n\nI'm going to work with the premise that you truly do not understand what you did wrong and try to walk you through things from your girlfriend's point of view along with how the way you say things feel \"off\" at best.\n\nFirst off, you did the right thing for letting your girlfriend know her sister was contacting you, it gives her a head's up in case her sister tries a more direct approach later. I hope you didn't try to convince your girlfriend to meet her sister though, that would be messed up. \n\nSecond, how did the sister contact you? If you didn't block the sister after finding out your girlfriend wanted nothing to do with her, that is strange behavior at best. At the time, you should have just said no to the loan and warned your girlfriend again. \n\nThird, you did go behind her back. You said nothing to your girlfriend and involved yourself in her sister's business. Doing this does a lot that you might not be aware of. It means the sister now thinks you are an in to get information and maybe later contact with your girlfriend. It means that you are at least willing to spend money on her, which the sister might take advantage of later. \n\nFourth, when you finally went to your girlfriend to tell her about it, it was in a \"I just did this behind your back and now am just telling you way.\" It wasn't about the money, it was the fact you got into contact with someone she doesn't want in her life and you basically laid out a way for the sister to claw her way back into your girlfriend's life. \n\nWe don't know the reason your girlfriend went no contact with her sister, but I will lay out a story so you understand how dangerous this is. Imagine you had a sister that beat you, even though you are bigger it didn't matter, they would yell at you and beat the tar out of you. You finally, after years of it, are able to get that sister out of your life and later met someone you care for. You tell that person you are no contact with your sister but due to trauma, you don't want to talk about it. A few years later your girlfriend says your sister contacted her and that your sister wanted to \"reconnect\". You feel sick, how did they find your girlfriend's contact information, what if they get to you again. It is a living nightmare. You tell your girlfriend in that you never want to see your sister again and trust your girlfriend to understand and respect your wishes. One day, a year later, your girlfriend comes up to you and tells you that not only did your sister contact her again, that she met up with your sister and even bought her a car. Oh god, your sister is inching her way back into her life. Does she know where you live? Why did your girlfriend even keep talking to your sister? Why would your girlfriend buy her a car and talk to your sister like this? You told your girlfriend that you didn't want your sister in your life and your girlfriend is over there being friendly with your sister? Your girlfriend knows your sister hurt you to the point you went no contact with your sister but your girlfriend is still talking to your sister and even helping her? How could your girlfriend do this to you? How can you trust them with anything else when they broke your trust on this when they knew how hurt you were?\n\nDo you see it? Now we don't know what caused them to go no contact, but you basically decided that whatever the reasoning was, it didn't matter. The last time you immediately went to tell your girlfriend about the contact but this time you didn't, it shows that you knew it would at least upset her. You met the person who she doesn't want in her life at all and even did them a huge favor. You completely went against their wishes and now are saying to say it is okay, simply due to the fact your finances are not combined. You might have \"felt a bit sorry for her\", but if you respected your girlfriend's wishes, you would have never even had the information to feel that way. You are 100% the asshole.", "YTA\n\nApparently there is a fall out about an ex boyfriend....\nNow her boyfriend goes behind her back to buy a car for her sister. \nWay to drive that knife deeper! \nYou have to stay out of the relationship between your gf and her sister.\nIt is just that simple. \n\nSet up a contract that she pays you back monthly and NO contact further. \nIn the end you are to support your gf. Before she thinks you can't be trusted.", "YTA For all the reasons that everyone already mentioned. OMG what is wrong with you?", "Oh hell no. YTA dude. I have serious concerns about your intentions for buying a teenager a car but I don't want to get banned for voicing them. Just YTA.", "YTA and a weird one at that. You are internally framing this situation as if you just have a kind heart, but that kindness comes at the emotional expense of your girlfriend. \n\nWith your actions, you've spelled out that that not only do you not think your gf's feelings are important, but that you also know better than she does about who she wants in her life. What you've done is condescending and arrogant and I would be furious if I were her. You owe her an apology and you need to go to therapy if you genuinely don't understand how you've crossed an astonishingly clear boundary.", "Your GF and her sister, who is MUCH younger than you, had a falling-out over a man. So bad that your GF won't even *speak* to her sister and doesn't even want to discuss what she did. And you're secretly meeting this girl and buying her things? \n\nDo you not see now why your GF wants nothing to do with this young woman or what kind of trouble she's able to cause? She played on your manly-man desire to \"come to her rescue\", solely to cause a rift between the two of you (I mean, come, of all the people in her life she chose to ask *you* for money for a car?). \n\nAnd you fell for it big-time. \n\nWAKE. UP. \n\nYTA.", "YTA - Why in the world would you sneak around behind your girlfriend's back to even talk to her sister, let alone meet her and buy her a car???? I can't. This would be a reason to end your relationship.", "YTA. Where is your respect here for your partners boundaries and decisions?! Your behaviour is a HUGE red flag to me. You obviously knew what you did was wrong or you would have told your gf of the plans to meet her sister rather than waiting until after.", "I hate to say YTA on this one because you meant well. But, to a woman, loaning (probably giving) money to someone she hates is a serious breach of loyalty.\n\nI have a sister that I hate and only wish I had gone NC a lot sooner than I did. If my sig other ever gave/loaned her money it would be the end of our relationship. \n\nYou blew it on this one.", "If it were me, I would\u2019ve dumped your ass asap! Like boundaries dude!!

Did she sleep with him? Did she steal his money? Did she tell him lies about here? Did she run him over with a car? Did she do something that ended their relationship? You don\u2019t know. For all you know she is a con artist. And really it doesn\u2019t matter what she did. \n\nYour actions show:\n\n1) that you do not believe her when she says she doesn\u2019t want a relationship with her. \n\n2) you do not respect her boundaries \n\n3) you Will choose someone you do not know over her. \n\n4) you make bad financial decisions (giving someone you don\u2019t know is not smart)\n\n5) you will do things that affect her life behind her back and without consideration of her feelings. \n\nYou had the best of intentions but disregarding how this would affect you GF is a big problem.

Thought it made more sense that OP\u2019s gf thinks her little sister seduced him, it fits a little better with the \u201colder sister said this, but it didn\u2019t really happen\u201d sort of thing. I do also find it odd that OP would want to help someone who has falsely accused a previous boyfriend of sexual assault. I think men are more sensitive to putting themselves in situations where they can be falsely accused with nothing but \u201che said, she said\u201d as an argument. That\u2019s my reasoning, anyway, but we\u2019ll never know unless OP explains.", "Sure, the sister could have been dating an 18 year old, so I guess in some states his interest in a 15 year old would be legal if still icky.", "OP is YTA for this specific conflict with his gf.  \n\nHowever, sister is an AH for asking her estranged sister\u2019s boyfriend for money (wtf?), and gf is very probably an AH for blaming her sister, who was then 14/15, for most anything that might have happened \u201cwith a (presumably adult) boy\u201d.  Of course there is the slim chance that she did something truly horrid, such as a false accusation, as others have mentioned.

Not to mention sister was 14/15 so she is more likely a victim of an adult if it is a sexual nature", "My first thought was \"Sister kept coming on to the adult boyfriend despite many expressions of discomfort from both OP's girlfriend and her then boyfriend, and the sister then threatened a false accusation if she didn't get her way\".", "This is not how Dom Toretto greets estranged siblings", "I was about to say this too lol", "I just lost my job, I am totally in line for a 2000 dollar \u201cloan\u201d just because!", "Yikes that must've been the dagger to her heart when she found out that he gave her money", "The whole thing is so weird", "There is a lot else possible.  Her sister could have been stalking her boyfriend (early teens with crushes can get stalkery and some people tend to brush it off as 'cute' so it doesn't get addressed as seriously as other stalking) or she could have constantly hit the boyfriend up for money (most likely) or could have constantly made moves on the boyfriend.  15 year olds with high drama and poor boundaries can do a lot damage.  The fact that people are jumping to 'clearly the boyfriend was inappropriate' are overlooking that women can be mad at other women for legitimate reasons that are not 'she slept with my boyfriend'.   So far the girlfriend was the only sane looking member of this comedy of errors - so I am willing to believe her sister did something legitimately upsetting.", "if you say oranges slowly it sounds like gullible...", "Yay!  2000 for everyone oprah style", "Me too!!!  Gimme gimme gimme!", "But the thing that happened was not necessary something sexual. It could be that the little sister was spreading rumours about either the sister or the BF, manipulating, trying to break them up, etc", "Pretty much sums it up perfectly.", "Seriously.  Clearly the sister is at some level of fault here as she is crossing all kinds of boundaries.  If your sister is not speaking to you, contacting her boyfriend that you have never met is wildly out of line.  And then asking him for money????? He didn't see anything wrong with this???  As far as references for loaning someone money go, my sister that I refuse to talk to is the lowest possible bar.", "This is what I came to say", "And regardless of his age, he was her sisters BF... I've been the teenage girl who was \"so mature look at my older bf\". But I thought it was ok because of only affected me. \"Sisters BF\" is off limits no matter the age, and if she was a good sister that should have been enough to keep her from trying anything with him.", "True! She Could had a crush or the opposite and didn\u2019t like him, wanted him gone. Too many things to speculate for certain. But since she was 15 you could chalk it up to immaturity. She\u2019s 19 now and can\u2019t be excused for the behavior. \n\nEven if you remove the ex factor and she still had a good relationship with her sister, OP would still be TAH here. He still went behind back breaking her trust. \n\nThe sister is also TAH bc how could she think asking your sisters bf for money is ok? Especially when she doesn\u2019t even know him or have a relationship with her sister. That isn\u2019t going help to mend the bridge instead I\u2019m sure she just torched it. \n\nMaybe OP\u2019s gf was overreacting 4 yrs ago and was extreme to go no contact with her sister. But She is not overreacting now.", "If I was his girlfriend, I wouldn't be wrong to assume OP was cheating on me with sister with speaking to her blocked ass behind my back while buying her a car like it's nothing.", "Your idea also makes sense.  What I interpret as the thing \"sis says I did, but I didn't\" is the 'lying', which to me makes sense if younger sis doesn't know how much/what bf knows.    It reads to me as a pre-emptive excuse.\n\nDefinitely agree there's no way of knowing unless op explains.", "I was thinking more on the the sister had a crush on the boyfriend and was cyber stalking and it got out of hand.", "YTA. You went behind your girlfriend's back. You have no idea what happened between her and her sister. How did she even get your contact info if she and your girlfriend are estranged?", "Finally someone said it.", "Thank you finally someone with some sense. If GF\u2019s ex slept with her 15 yo sister I would dump him because he has cheated on you already with others and easily could have seduced your sister. If your sister seduced him call me crazy but you could leave the situation and say no. Tell your GF you are worried because she is 15 and acting out and get her help. If the GF is still stuck on something 4 years ago that her ex technically could have gone to jail for regardless of consent even in SC. The GF can\u2019t even tell him exactly the whole story which to me is a red flag. If I were a dude I wouldn\u2019t have met with her or got her a car but what\u2019s done is done. I would run away from this whole mess. In all honesty the GF is the TA a complete explanation was needed as to why she cut off a 15 yo. Leave while you can they all sound uncaring and toxic. Frankly cutting off her sister and her sister not getting any help and treated badly of course she ended up this way the GF contributed to the whole thing.", "Also highly suspicious that he didn't ever bother asking why girlfriend disliked her sister so much, even after sister contacted him. And crucially? If he truly suspected it wasn't an asshole move he would have bloody well TOLD his girlfriend about the continued messaging.", "The red flag goes both ways in this case, IMHO. Yes, OP YTA, but OPs girlfriend had a falling out over her sister and a boy when the sister is 6 years younger and currently a teenager.  There's all sorts of math that can be involved,  but a lot sums up to the girlfriend being mad at her underage sister because her ex was a predator. \n\nThis is all a bad situation, OP. Probably be thankful you only spent 2 grand to find out.", "> and also get a miata\n\nSame!  Or a Honda del Sol.  Love our WRX, but wouldn't mind a 5-speed 2 seater.\n\nThough if you got either of those for $2k, you're probably trailering it home.", "Thank you for an explanation that makes some kind of sense. This one was breaking my brain.", "He could have compassion. GF straight up should be honest about the situation especially after he was contacted. It could be many things but if it was only she slept with her ex at 15 and was 19 or older that is illegal and I would have kicked him to the curb and discussed how horrible he was to my sister and help her. If she still is that angry and want discuss details well I would drop all them because frankly the whole thing sounds toxic and the BF seems nice and needs someone who isn\u2019t stuck on her ex blaming a child in a woman\u2019s body. I wouldn\u2019t buy her a car and leave all of them behind. The BF deserves better like a family that cares about each other and isn\u2019t bitter, hateful or deceiving and conniving. The whole situation is a big red flag leave her and her toxic family.", "Exactly you could take these exact same \u201cfacts\u201d and change the perspective so the story is now \u201cmy little sister came onto my boyfriend and when I confronted her she denied it and gaslit me\u201d. Now fast forward and she\u2019s doing to same thing with her sister\u2019s new boyfriend OP.", "True because miata prices shot up overnight. \nBut it's OK I'll trailer it home and put a new engine I got from a junkyard in it cause fuccc stock anything lmao", "Agree that the whole thing is a giant red flag, i saw it from the gf perspective but your point from OP\u2019s one is very very valid. But we don\u2019t actually know what happened (unless OP wrote it somewhere and i missed it, then i would need to make an edit), maybe it was nothing sexual that happened there (who knows if the sister is a pathological liar or something)", "Yeah that\u2019s very weird. I don\u2019t blame girlfriend.  YTA OP.  Girlfriend needs to run", "Sure more than likely the sister is manipulating him, and the meeting up and loaning money are sketchy, but as a guy who's been through something similar, the acts stated here (if true) are not asshole moves, but idiot ones. A simple \"she tried to sleep with my boyfriend\" or \"accused my boyfriend of molesting her\" would set my defenses up way more than other things. \n\nNothing in his post indicates that he's putting the sister over the girlfriend, just that he's feeling awkward as hell in the middle of the family drama, and chose an unfortunate way to get involved. It would be smart to stay out of it, being an asshole is a skill some people have to learn. Until then, they are pushovers, who can be easily swayed by the idea of helping a broken family.", "Could be that ops gf was in the wrong.", "Exactly and if she just cut her out of her life the sister is not that great. My boyfriend did that to my sister and i don\u2019t care how she was acting it is illegal even in SC, I would tell him to get lost. I don\u2019t care if she did try something because at 15 yo something else is going on. I\u2019m a nurse on OB and while 15 yo act tough and grown up most are not mentally at a 21 yo level. They still are kids, and if it was an ex boyfriend it is time to let it go. Even if she falsely accused him of anything. Personally, I would make sure she was safe and really step up my relationship with her and find out what is going on with her to act our that way. Most likely there is a reason. After this long though if the older sister dropped her and her family, she turned up doing this because no one stopped to help her. If she had a mental issue problem or heavily into drugs then that should have been discussed and what you did to help her.  He isn\u2019t exactly the AH but more needed to be known about the issue before buying a car. Plus the older sister should be honest with her boyfriend about what happened. The whole thing sounds fishy and fake and 4 years over a boy and her sister was 15 yo sounds childish. I would think twice about being in a relationship where my GF couldn\u2019t be honest and cut off a 15 yo that is a huge red flag for me. I would cut ties with both of them because the whole situation sounds toxic an petty after this many years.", "You are right but if she was she most certainly needed psychiatric care at 15 yo and perhaps this wouldn\u2019t have been an issue. I wouldn\u2019t have bought a car but I wouldn\u2019t have let my girlfriend not tell me the details of why there is no contact either.  No matter what the sister needed help.", "how much you want to bet he never sees the money again", "Same\u2026 hit me up OP\u2026 I could use a \u201cloan\u201d", "And why is she even asking you?  Ever think it\u2019s to drive a wedge between you and her sister?  Which is exactly what\u2019s happened.", "The ex boyfriend thing is so vague. It might not have been a sexual thing. Maybe she thinks her sister spread a rumor he cheated. Maybe he did cheat and she told everyone embarrassing her. Maybe she sent flirty texts to him and he showed the sister. Something an immature a 15 yr old would do. \n\nHis GF didn\u2019t tell him why they didn\u2019t talk anymore or that it involved the ex. The sister told him that his gf accused her of doing something she didn\u2019t do, something to do with get ex. That leaves a lot open to interpretation. Im just not jumping to the worst case. \n\nI agree he made a dumb Decision and shouldn\u2019t have gotten involved. To be easily pushed over by a stranger. I think the AH part was not telling the girlfriend before and how he acted when the girlfriend got upset. He doesn\u2019t really know anything about the estrangement details.", "bet sister is still a conniving little interferer and is still trying to mess with the gf..and mess her up. which accounts then for why she doesn't talk to this little girl that often", "she might be physically older but mentally? probably still playing 13 year old games", "The old bf could have been young enough to be within the Romeo and Juliet clauses. We don't know his age. Tho that would mean he would have to be 18 or 19 and op Would be 21", "I think it's really weird and I have so many questions.\n\nLike, if they've been together for two years, has he not met any other family? The sister would have been 17 when they met, the sister wasn't living at home and not talked about by other family members? What are the family dynamics and at 19, would parents or other relatives be unable or unwilling to help her out?\n\nThis is all sus to me.", "Or maybe she \u201cborrowed\u201d an inordinate sum of money from him and never paid him back.", "Notice how he also points out the little sister is innocent even though his girlfriend doesn\u2019t believe it. So that means he is trusting the sister\u2019s side of the truth in that situation even though he hardly knows her", "The only source we have that the falling out is in regards to an ex-boyfriend is the sister. Who is currently crossing all boundaries and asking him for money knowing full well the gf would hate it and it would probably damage or end their relationship. \n\nThe sister should not be assumed to be a reliable narrater. \n\nHe has absolutely no idea why they fell out. \n\nThe people acting shady in the current scenario are the sister, for continuing to communicate behind the gf's back with the bf and asking him for money, and the bf, whom the sister manipulated into talking to her and buying her a car. \n\nSister sounds manipulative."]}
