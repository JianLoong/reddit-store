I don't know what about because my girlfriend never went into any specifics and that was before I even met her but they haven't spoken to each other since. I've been with my girlfriend for two years. About a year ago her sister reached out to me because she wanted me to persuade my girlfriend into meeting with her because she wanted to reconnect but when I told my girlfriend she said she never wants to see her.\n\nTwo weeks ago her sister messaged me again and asked me if she could borrow 2 grand from me because she needed to buy a new car and she said she'd pay my back monthly. I told her that I can't just borrow her money because I don't know her and I don't know if she's actually gonna use it to buy a car. But I told her that if she found a car for sale she wants I can go and see it with her and pay for it. So a couple days ago I met up with her and I paid just over 2 grand for a car. This was the first that I actually met her in person. I told her she could just pay me back whenever. I honestly just felt a bit sorry for her, I could tell she genuinely wants to reconnect with my girlfriend but she just refuses. Her sister also didn't tell me any specifics about their falling out but that it had to do with my girlfriends old boyfriend and how my girlfriend basically accused her of doing something she didn't do. I didn't press her for anything specific because I could tell she didn't want to talk about it. \n\nAfterwards I told my girlfriend about it and she got furious at me. She said I shouldn't have bought her a car and she claims I betrayed her trust by going behind her back. We argued about it for a while and well since then she barely speaks to me. But I honestly don't think I did anything wrong, especially since we don't share finances so I spent my own money and not hers. So was AITA?\n\nI don't know if ages are relevant here but I'm 27, my girlfriend is 25 and her sister is 19", "created_utc": 1676546557, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/113occp/aita_for_buying_my_girlfriends_sister_a_car/", "score": 378, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds like you're stepping pretty far out of line by playing the role of a middleman.\n\nAs someone whose spouse isn't connected to most of his immediate relatives, there isn't a chance in hell I would ever do anything like this. Loan money to someone related to my husband who my husband isn't even talking to? Try to pressure him into talking to them? Firm no. If someone reached out in that context, I would be having an open conversation with my husband about what he wants and prioritising his needs.\n\nYou literally don't know the ins and outs of what occurred in their relationship, but for some reason you've decided you really pity the sister she's not connected to. People don't generally block their family for small reasons and it's worth really remembering that. You also don't know whether or not the sister is lying to you if this is tied to her presence in one of your girlfriend's past relationships. You also have to consider that, if this is tied to a past relationship, her sister messaging **you** could really push your girlfriend's buttons.\n\nIt's quite strange that you're trying to play some sort of saviour-type role in this situation. Your girlfriend doesn't owe her sister anything. You don't know any of the facts. Stay out of it.

That's crazy. Even lending her the money is crazy. And then told her after the fact, what you did. You knew she wouldn't be happy about it. That's why you didn't tell her BEFORE you did.

I\u2019m stuck on the timeline, and I think the sister might actually be telling some truth. If this happened 4 years ago her sister was 15 and she was 21 so if anything did happen between sister and boyfriend. Her sister wasn\u2019t even able to consent because she was a minor and I\u2019m assuming the boyfriend was not. I feel like that needs some investigation on it own. \n\nBut YTA still. It could be quite possible that her sister might be somewhat innocent but you sir had no right to decide that and over step like you did.

The *only* scenario in which you _might_ not have be an AH is if you already a long standing, independent relationship with her sister. \n\nYou massively stepped over a boundary. It's not your place and you fucked up buddy.", "Im going against the grain here and say NTA/NAH - If her sister is 19 and they had a falling out 4 years ago over a boy, then the sister was only 15.\n\nSo if we are to presume she did something with a BF-at-the-time she was likely groomed by a much older adult. She's very much a victim in such a scenario and your GF needs to wake up to that.\n\nIf she didn't do something, and it's just an accusation by you GF then you're GF is entirely to blame.\n\nYes, you broke boundaries, but they're not there out any legit wrong doing by the sister.", "YTA\n\nIf girlfriend is no contact with her sister, you definitely should be no contact with sister.  You fucked up majorly.  Get your money back and block her, dumbass.", "YTA. HUGE betrayal here, and for what? A person you don\u2019t even know.

A 27 yo secretly buying a 19yo you barely know a car what could go wrong. \n\nYour gf has boundaries and you broke them. You know the issues between them had to do with her sister and her ex bf. Her sister secretly messaged you and keeps in contact with you.. it gets to a point where you secretly meet up with her and also buy her a car. If the sister genuinely wanted to reconnect, she would not be messaging her sister\u2019s bf when the fallout had to do with her coming between/over stepping boundaries with a previous boyfriend. It\u2019s extremely weird how much you\u2019re siding with your gf\u2019s sister over your gf in this mess between them. Which one are you dating? \n\nBtw can I have a free 2k too? I need me a car and can cry for it too", "YTA. You may have thought you were doing a nice thing, but sounds like you just landed yourself squarely in the shoes of your girlfriend\u2019s ex. \n\nIt\u2019s clear he cheated with the sister and now you\u2019ve gone behind your GF\u2019s back and spent time with the sister AND done something sneaky. She may never trust you again.", "YTA how did someone convince you to buy them a car and you don\u2019t even know them? Money please!

On top of your girlfriend not wanting to have her sister in her life! You blew through some major boundary here. So inappropriate on many levels.", "YTA because you have no idea why your gf has cut contact with her sister. People tend to cut family members out for a good reason and if your gf is not ready to disclose that reason to you then you should have minded your own business. \n\nI also find it really weird that her sister messaged you asking to borrow money. You didn't know her and she didn't know you, but she felt like it was appropriate to contact her estranged sister's boyfriend to ask for money? And you felt like it was appropriate to not tell your girlfriend? Have you considered that you might have been played like a fool? You have no clue if what sister told you is even partially accurate. The only reason you even know her is because she decided to hit you up for money so she definitely has a motivation to feed you a believable, sympathetic, story. Maybe she was telling the truth, who knows. I hate to tell you, though, that normal people do not ask strangers for money, especially that much money. \n\nHonestly, this might be breakup-worthy behavior. Not only did you violate a boundary your girlfriend had, but you secretly were in contact with her estranged teen sister and hid it from her. I'm struggling to understand how you think you didn't do anything wrong.", "YTA and it\u2019s bordering on weird. \n\nJust an additional reason YTA, grammatically you \u2018lend\u2019 money to somebody who \u2018borrows\u2019 from you.

I appreciate that by pointing this out I\u2019m becoming the AH.", "Yta im sure you view yourself as a nice guy but guys like you just go around hurting everyone they meet by doing things that are clearly inappropriate because you wanna save the day. No regard whatsoever for your partner. I hope your gf leaves you cause this is going to escalate. Buying a car for someone you don\u2019t know is insane and the fact that you see no problem with that is even worse.", "Idiot.\nYTA", "Yta. Dude it\u2019s obvious the younger sister was accused of messing with your gf ex boyfriend or crush. Sisters don\u2019t just fall out over borrowed clothes or makeup. Im guessing they don\u2019t share the same mom and dad because how can they not see each other on holidays for the 2 years you known your gf? Who did the sister live with and did you not visit the parents house?", "YTA you did everything wrong.", "This is gross & YTA.  After the initial refusal most people's response would be to say I'm respecting my girlfriends wishes & won't be responding again. Your response is to not only reply but meet her & give her a sizable amount of money. What need in you did this whole thing meet? I'd be disgusted by your behaviour & then that dismissive attitude.", "YTA for getting into any time of relationship with the sister. But it\u2019s also an idiotic thing to do.", "YTA.  You crossed a boundary and did it behind your girlfriend's back.  Very disrespectful and intrusive.  I would not stay with you if I were her.  Don't pretend that you don't know what you did.", "Yta. Why you trying to fuck her sister?", "Yta", "Jeez, what are you trying to do, sleep with her sister or something? Because I don't understand why you'd buy a car for a stranger who your girlfriend doesn't want in her life. YTA", "YTA! Stay in your lane dude!", "YTA, it would be one thing if your girl hadn't said anything, but she told you specifically not to do anything with her sister. People don't just cut people out for no reason. You betrayed her and her trust. Going forward if she decides to stay with you, she might just be questioning everything you do or say. The trust there is gone.", "YTA. If I were your girlfriend I\u2019d never talk to either of you again", "YTA-  there no reason for you meet her and hiding from your gf.", "YTA, boundaries were pushed beyond just talking to her sister,  but like buying her a car. You can force your GF to interact with her sister...but now she is going to have to either deal with this money exchange or move on. \n\nWhen she says she doesn't want anything to do with her sister, she means it. It's up to her to want her sister in her life. Not you.", "So, this is your story. Your gf has a falling out with her sister. It has something to do with gf's old bf. The sister says that nothing happened and doesn't want to talk about it. And, for some reason, you believe sister and not your gf.\n\nNow, the same sister has been contacting current bf (aka you) for the past year. Giving you a sob story. You are keeping this contact from gf. You buy sister a car. (Don't fool yourself, you're not getting that money back. Did you also buy insurance? Pay for the tax and title?)\n\nI feel very sorry for the gf. She has terrible taste in partners.", "YTA and possible an idiot who buys a total stranger a car? You need a refresher on BOUNDARIES so you can see clearly how much you stepped on hers.", "And to piggyback on others, you're not talking to her sister (another woman) behind your partner's back.

YTA", "Yeah you'll probably be single soon this was a heavy overstep in boundaries. Regardless of whether the sister says she didn't do it or not it sounds like she probably did cuz why would she reach out to you when she has no connection to you and then you go and buy her car. Wow dude I don't know what the hell is wrong with you. YTA", "In what realm of reality do you reside in that you felt like ANY of this was appropriate?!?!\n\nJesus Christ, YTA!!", "YTA", "YTA, but more importantly, you don't \"borrow\" someone money...you \"lend\" it to them.", "YTA.  I'm glad you've got enough extra cash that you can give random people $2000, but that money probably would have been better spent being donated to a foodbank.  \n\n\nI think your relationship with the gf is over, but I'm sure the younger sister will be willing to take you for a ride as long as you're paying for it.", "Dude are you dumb?!\nYou have no respect for your gf's boundaries and doing this behind her back as well... No, just no. I hope she leaves you tbh. You are such an AH.", "YTA. The sister wants to \"reconnect \" with your girlfriend at the same time she needs $2000? You didn't find this suspicious!?", "YTA \n\nNo explanation needed.", "Huge YTA...I would break up with you because you seem to have no respect for boundaries.  You knew your girlfriend was estranged from her sister, it was reinforced a year ago when sister contacted you to try to force a reconciliation.\n\nNow a year later she is asking you(a stranger) for money and you decide it was cool to meet up and give it to her. Were you talking to her for a whole year prior to this because who just asks a stranger for money and who agrees to it. \n\nYou completely betrayed your GF's trust and think you did nothing wrong. Hope she wakes up and breaks up with you.", "Who the hell buys some random people 2k cars??", "YTA! I would have dumped you and pretend we never met!", "YTA \n\nYou are in communication with someone your gf has stated repeatedly is not allowed to be involved in her life. That should have been enough information for you to know that by default the sister is not to be in your life. \n\nNow not only have you been in repeated contact with the sister you have tied her to your life for a non specific time frame via a car loan. Indirectly tying the sister to your gf. Which she has repeatedly and directly told you she does not want. Your actions do not show any regard and little respect for your gf. Are you sure you love her? Your actions say you don't.  \n\nIt is good to hear you and gf have seperate finances already. Will be easier to seperate the relationship since you do not understand boundaries and do not respect your gf. Hope your new friendship with the sister is worth losing your gf.", "YTA. That would be the end of the relationship for me.", "I'm your girlfriend's long lost step brother. I want to get back in her life and reunite our family, including our little sister. Please DM me to get my info to send me 2 grand for reasons.", "Yta. I do think the real reason you went to meet with the sister was to get answers to why the estrangement happened. You still shouldn't have given her 2k for a car.", "YTA\u2026 Your gf went NC with her sister for a reason but yet you went behind her back and betrayed her\u2026 But yet you think what you did was just fine\u2026. I hope she breaks up with you", " YTA. Your girlfriend clearly doesn\u2019t want any contact with her and you bought her a car without speaking to your gf first!

You don\u2019t know her and don\u2019t owe her anything!", "I find it incredibly odd that you would just so willingly spend $2000 on someone you don't know anything about. That's the weirdest thing about this. Hell she isn't even your family since you guys aren't in laws or anything like that.\n\nUltimately the beef your gf and her sister had aren't any of your business. So I don't really think you \"betrayed\" her trust. You just know they had some issue. NTA.\n\nHowever, like I said above, it's extremely weird that you just gave her that money.

I'm also going to be frank and if your gfs sister is willing to go behind your sisters back to talk to you while also getting you to loan her a large amount of money... I think there may be some weight to what your gf believes.", "YTA here obviously because you didn\u2019t respect your girlfriends boundaries.\n\nAs far as the people that are accusing the sister of cheating with the ex, sister would have been 15 at the time and girlfriend would have been 21.

Good maybe,but not wise.", "YTA Why would her sister come to you for such a big ask when she's never met you? When your girlfriend has told you they don't speak? This is super weird, dude.

If I were you I'd get the money back asap", "YTA. I'm honestly trying to comprehend this. You just used 2k to buy someone you don't know a car.

That should have been it for you. She does not want to talk about it. That should have been it for you. Do you ever think this is how it started with her ex-boyfriend?

How deluded do you have to be to not see that? \n\nYou completely crossed your girlfriends boundaries here.", "YTA\n\nYou have no logic.

She put the blame in both of them or else she would be with her ex stil. The sister wasnt just stupid she knew what she was doing would hurt her sister and was wrong.
