{"id": 32109, "submission_id": "1881m7e", "title": "AITAH for telling my mother in not interested in her friends because they're minors?", "selftext": "My mother (40) has a lot of friends in the 14-18 age range and she's always trying to tell me about them and their lives and drama. A lot of which is about this that happened to them at school, boyfriends/girlfriends, fights with family, etc things you'd deal with as a kid. And it majorly creeps me out.\n\nToday she was trying to tell me about her friend who just turned 18 so she moved into her boyfriends *room* in his parents house. But she's being treated like a bum by his sister because she has no job, doesn't go to school, doesn't leave the room, has no money, eats up/ uses the products in the house bought by his parents. Ofc because SHES 18. \n\nI just told her straight out \"Mom im not interested in hearing about your friends. You're a lot older than they are it just comes off as weird that you're so obsessed with their lives. Im all for work gossip but every time u try to \"gossip\" with me its about minors. Your fiends are kids. And they're mysteriously gone when they leave their teen years. It's just weird and im tired of hearing about it. You should get friends around your age.\"\n\nIt probably grosses me out more because the majority of her partners have been way younger than her. She was with a 23 year old when she was 34, she was with a 20 year old when she was 32, 24-35/ 21/31. Her recent shocker was last year when she was with a 19 year old and she was 39. The rest i don't remember. She's recently with a guy who's a few years younger than her but thats for financial stability, she's getting comfortable having no job. (Shes been with him for a few years but its long distance so there's a lot of room to cheat.) \n\nNow she's being very short with me. Won't look at me. Doesnt make conversation and has been snapping at me. I feel I was too harsh and I should have eased into it because it's been an issue pretty much all my life and maybe I should have told her sooner. AITAH?\n\nEDIT: For ppl asking where she meets these kids. Some are kids of her old friends or class mates. And one time I saw her searching the name of our high school and going through the profiles that popped up from those searches. And ofc if she meets one, those have friends and those have friends etc etc", "created_utc": 1701400838, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1881m7e/aitah_for_telling_my_mother_in_not_interested_in/", "score": 48, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

(2) I've always just sat through her rants about her young friends as though I didn't mind and maybe I should have told her sooner that I don't like it rather than just going off on her out of no where.

How is she meeting these minors? \n\nNgl this sounds genuinely predatory. People your mom\u2019s age rarely, if ever have good intentions hanging around people who aren\u2019t or just barely legal adults in that way.\n\nEDIT: I think your mom needs help, or the parents of those kids eventually will call the police on her ass. There is NO good reason she is actively looking up kids from your high school online.", "Yeah, your mom sounds like a child predator.  Do any of the children\u2019s parents know she\u2019s \u201cfriends\u201d with them? I\u2019d be informing parents of anyone under 18 for sure. You mother needs therapy - it is not normal for a 40 year old to have friends that are children. If I were you I\u2019d tell her she needs to cut contact with those children and if you see her hanging out with minors, you\u2019ll call the police on her. If you can contact parents, do - otherwise I\u2019d distance my self from her as much as possible.", "NTA \n\nAlso what the \\*beep\\* did I just read?! \n\nDoes your mother know she's not 15 anymore? Or does she just not care that she comes across as predatory? \n\n*Is* she a predator? I personally know someone who was abused in that way by a woman, so I know full well that women can be predators too. And to be honest, it very much sounds like she is one. \n\nMaybe you should report her?", "You sound quite normal to be posting on Reddit. Healthy even. Refreshing. NTA.", "Nta- your mom sounds like a predator", "NTA.  It's not just weird. It's creepy that your mom's friends are all minors.", "NTA. Sounds like your mother really needs to talk to a mental health professional because that\u2019s not healthy. What do these kids parents think about a 40 year old woman trying to get closer to their kids? If I was one of these kids parents I\u2019d call the police.", "NTA this is so friggen weird. Sorry you have to deal with that. I\u2019m 37f with a 15 year old daughter. I think her friends are adorable and I love having them around the house, but when my kid starts spilling the friend drama tea, my eyes glaze over lol. Middle aged moms aren\u2019t meant to be friends with teens. A safe place for them, sure. A protective figure? Okay. But a friend to kids who you have no reason to associate with? So weird.", "Uhhh, your mom should be investigated.", "NTA - I can\u2019t think of any time I\u2019ve heard of a 40yo being close friends with 14yos. The best outcome is that she\u2019s imagining herself as being closer with them than she actually is - you described them as the children of her friends - maybe she\u2019s trying to cling to her youth and her \u2018best years\u2019 instead of actually growing up, and is just parroting what her adult friends have told her about what\u2019s happening in their childrens\u2019 lives. Either way, NTA for calling her out on how weird it is.", "What the hell did I just read? \nNTA but what the actual F is going on here man.", "I just wanna know how she has friends this age", "Yeah... I would not only be telling her that you aren't interested, I'd be 100% distancing myself from the entire situation. Like, not going around, going low contact, etc. \n\nNTA", "Where are their parents?", "NTA", "Um ?? Either she\u2019s a predator or she\u2019s emotionally stunted. Or both. Maybe let the parents of her \u201cfriends\u201d know what\u2019s going on. \n\nNTA", "NTA. I\u2019m not sure what your mother is doing, but I\u2019m fairly sure she has some issues she needs to sort out.\n\nI have younger friends. And yes, some are teens in the 16 up range. I do a lot of local theatre and the age ranges in any production vary massively so you get to know all ages of people. However, there are boundaries, they\u2019re not my friends in the same way as my peers are. The idea of going home and talking about their personal lives in that way is just gross, in most cases I probably wouldn\u2019t even know that information because that\u2019s not stuff we talk about as it would be inappropriate. And actively seeking out teens? No, just no. \n\nYour mother needs to remember her age, and that\u2019s not something I say very often. If she doesn\u2019t, she\u2019s heading for trouble.", "NTA. Your mom is a predator. There's no reason a grown women should think anything about teenagers other than that they're annoying fucks.
