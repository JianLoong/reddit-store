Fast food places often see people request cups for water, and then fill them with soda instead. So some try to prevent this by giving \"courtesy\" size cups, while others charge a fee for the bigger cups. Offering to let you fill your water bottle was a nice compromise. Some places would make you purchase bottled water.", "If your wife is always wrong, she can't get mad when you take other people's sides in disagreements.  In this instance, she's wrong.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Water is free. Cups are not. You shouldn\u2019t be expected to take her side if she\u2019s wrong. Sounds like she just doesn\u2019t like being wrong and has misplaced her anger onto you.", "Why does she even need a cup if she has a refillable water bottle with her?", "NTA.  The word \u201cridiculous\u201d was poorly chosen, and merits an apology, but your overall point is a good one.\n\nMargins are slender at high-volume places like that, and if she gets a free 12-Oz, so does the next person, and it makes a dent.", "NTA - they charge people for the cups...the crappy soda is free.", "NTA but you could have been nicer. Fast food restaurants do this because of inventory control. They track drinks sold by cups used. If they give away cups for water it messes this up. It also makes it easier for people to steal pop if it's self serve.", "NTA\n\nThere is no side for you to take! It\u2019s common for restaurants and movie theaters to have water cups and anyone who has ever been a patron at either knows this.", "They gave her a cup of water.\n\nThey offered for you both to fill your water bottles.\n\nYour wife sounds entitled and rude.", "NTA overall however, I think you should have said it differently. \u201cWell honey, they\u2019re just doing their job\u201d or something to that degree. \u201cYou\u2019re ridiculous\u201d sounds accusatory.", "nta - the different cups is so they can see at a glance who is stealing soda", "NTA, because having worked in fast food places we don\u2019t give you the regular cups for water because people invariably use them for soda. there are legit designated water cups", "ESH, your wife for expecting to receive a large cup and balking at the store's rules, allowing them to charge for said cup, and you for calling her ridiculous and not calmly explaining how many fast-food joints operate.", "NTA, but agreeing that it's an annoying policy probably would have saved you some unnecessary grief. Sometimes our partners just need quick validation for their annoyance. It's not really about who's right or wrong or the technicalities of the situation, but about acknowledging our partners feelings and moving on - essentially water cups or rude servers or annoying policies aren't the hills to die on... unless your wife throws entitled fits all the time - then I totally support calling her on it.", "NAH.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t cost you anything to validate your wife here, but it sounds like she was a little over the top too. It\u2019s pretty easy to say: \u2018yeah, you\u2019re right, it seems silly - but that\u2019s what manager used to tell me too - it was nice they offered to fill our water bottles though\u2019.", "NTA, but also - not the hill to die on.", "YTA \n\n\"I told her that she was the one being ridiculous and that they have the right to give her whatever cup they have chosen to give people for water.\"\n\n\"I have worked in lots of fast food places.

Your wife feels like you never support her. Do you ever try to sympathize with her? \"It's an annoying policy, but when I worked at x I would have gotten in trouble with the manager if I gave away bigger cups, so it's probably the same here.\"", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Usually, the water and soda is in the same place.

Anyway, this guy asks for a cup, i give him the small cup, like ops gf he started to complain why i couldnt give him the bigger cups, i told them that those were for drinks you pay, not to be handed out for free to drink water, he kept insisting that it didnt made sense and that i wasnt being very welcome, and i was like, im sorry, i cant give those cups to you.
