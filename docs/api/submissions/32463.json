She should stop that.

I was like you living in the Stone Age with an alarm clock. But there is a solution that should not cost anything. Use your phone set the alarm on vibrate and put it under the pillow. It will wake you up but not anyone else. Been doing this for years now and wife loves it too. So I can sneak out of bed and go to the gym. If the whole phone under pillow is not an option they have clocks with a vibrate pad that goes under the pillow cheap on Amazon. About 25$. Also. Stop using the snooze. It actually make you more tiered. Learn to get out as soon as the alarm goes off.

It should be you vs the problem, not each other.\n\nIf you try the vibrating alarm and she still wakes up (which is what happened with me) then she might consider sleeping in another room.   I went that route after accepting that my sleep issues couldn\u2019t be solved with those adjustments to the alarm only, and the only way I can guarantee sleep is by sleeping alone with white noise, no movement, and it being cold as a morgue. \n\nGood luck!", "I'm going to abstain from any side of NTA/YTA.

So what's your proposed solution? If you have a job that pays well, you can afford a base level garmin, fitbit, etc that's significantly cheaper than an apple watch", "ESH.

She's also being unreasonable by not meeting you halfway, like getting earplugs or something.", "I\u2019m going against the grain with YTA.

It took a lot to get him to be an adult and stop that crap.\nIf you're waking up consistently when it first goes off, not every single time but consistently, you aren't an AH for simply needing to get up for work.", "If she\u2019s not gonna support you waking up an hour early to make sure your fellow dorks are ready for battle she ain\u2019t the one", "I'm inclined toward ESH.\n\nI agree with you that he is waking up to go to work, and if there were no other solution then she would just have to deal with it.\n\nBut why CAN'T he go get the apple watch to make her life better without making his any worse?", "Lol the WoW comment out of nowhere", "Why should she? \n\nThey need to find a solution that works best for them. He doesn\u2019t mention what she\u2019s doing to stay in bed, to be this upset I\u2019d imagine she\u2019s caring for their kids or something.", "This is our solution. I\u2019m a terrible sleeper and often can\u2019t go back to sleep once I wake up. My partner gets up between 4:30-5:00\u2026so I do too. I don\u2019t care that we go to bed at 8:30. I have time to be productive in the morning before work. Plus, it\u2019s nice to go to bed together.  We have a solid routine, which also helps my sleep.", "Some people only need 5 hours where some need a full 9. That's biological and a sleep schedule won't fix it.", "Dont even need a watch. Lots of phone apps do it too for a yearly subscription. My $30 sleep app is worth gold IMO.", "Not everyone can wake up to those.", "Ear plugs don't erase all sounds and are so uncomfortable and affect my sleep - spouse of a snorer.", "That would never wake me up.", "Garmin Instinct watches can go 28 days on a single charge", "I bet Leroy Jenkins got up BEFORE the first alarm", "Damn, now THATS old school.", "I wake up before my alarm most days, regardless of what time I go to sleep, and it makes me so angry because that\u2019s time I could have stayed sleeping!", "Same here. Our schedules vary quite a bit and everyday is different. I like to have something to listen to when I go to sleep so my mind isn't racing which is probably annoying to others. We both have snooze alarms. Some days I need to be up first, some days it's her. We are respectful of each other so just do our best to keep the house as quiet as possible for the other. It isn't that hard and is just part of being married. \n\nI apparently need to make my own post for yelling \"quiet\" at my dog who apparently needed to be at work at 330am last night and was very vocal about it.", "Did you verify this in any way? I'm pretty sure they aren't any more dangerous than any other appliance.", "If you're married, who cares who buys it.  Get a vibrating under the pillow alarm. Don't have to wear.", "Have a tried a sleep app? I\u2019ve been using Sleep Time on my iPhone for years. I\u2019ve tried other ones, but this one works for me. It\u2019s $30 a year and just requires you to keep your phone plugged in and face down on your bed. You can set it to a silent vibration and it will wake you up on your lightest sleep cycle.\n\nIt\u2019s not as pricy as an Apple Watch or a Fitbit and you dont have to worry about charging an additional device.", "I got a $60 watch from Amazon. Does almost everything an Apple watch does, and the battery lasts for a week. Deffo has a vibrate alarm.", "yeah, ok\u2026 i get insomnia occasionally and am in college (stem major) and the mornings after i don\u2019t get enough sleep are hell. i can turn off the alarm dozens of times and still find it physically painful to like, open my eyes. i really do love how many people on reddit have never confronted whatever bias is \u201cif i haven\u2019t struggled with x, everyone who does is lazy\u201d", "Sounds like you two need to talk about maybe sleeping separately so you won't disturb eachother.", "To be frank given how much work it is to babysit a 40 man raid (meaning a 60-80 member guild) I kinda get it.\n\nMy old GL/RL was weeping tears of joy when the reduction to 25-man was announced with BC.", "Well as a person who does hiring, if it was for a management role and considering I played WoW during peak classic era and beyond. I would honestly consider bringing it up to talk about, at the very least as an ice breaker or at most depending on how they talk about it it could actually be considerable insight to their management style.", "It probably implied good people skills and ability to co-ordinate with many people at once, possibly even lead them.\n\nI imagine it's an admirable quality if the employer isn't a stick-in-the-mud.", "Lol, is this secretly the ADHD subreddit? I feel incredibly seen, now.", "This was my question too! I used to be the one whose alarm woke my husband when I had to go to work so I got a vibrating watch (very cheap and light - think fitbit style) and haven't had an issue since.\n\nI don't understand all the comments saying the wife should put up with it and alarms are normal. Everyone has different sleep cycles and sleep needs. It's not unreasonable for her to ask him to accommodate those.\n\nAnd the focus on who buys it suggests this relationship already has issues.", "This varies by person.", "If I go to bed at 8 and even get woken up for a minute by 10/11 I have a really hard time falling back asleep. It\u2019s actually easier for me in the AM", "I sleep like the dead dude. Flat on my back, arms at my sides, impossible to wake up with anything quieter than shouting. I've slept through a fire alarm before.", "My husband has to get up 3 hours earlier than I do. I suffer from migraines so it is impossible to get back to sleep once woken up. My DH sleeps in the guest bedroom where he can use the second bathroom and not wake me up on the days we both work. It is wonderful that he cares enough about me to do this. I tried wearing earplugs to stay asleep but they only helped me with his snoring not the alarms. It is always good to work with each other to find solutions to the issues. I think asking for the partner to find another type of alarm is part of the process. Sleep deprivation is bad.", "Lol for sure it would, at least in a perfect world \ud83d\ude05", "His name is flat Stanley", "Good!  More people should sleep apart as desired or necessary.\n\nI\u2019m sorry about your migraines.  They\u2019re awful.", "Found the \u201cbuy something that vibrates, solve marital problems\u201d section of the comments", "I would get more pissed as well if someone made that remark to me. That is how you talk to a child to help them process their emotions not an adult. (Child social worker here). I know you're trying to be respectful by phrasing it that way but it kinda comes off as condescending. What helps me in these types of situations... and it may come off as odd or to some people even stupid but... I study the planets. Once I understand their star sign reading the planets helps me to talk to people better.\n\nSo we have trigger \"seasons\" where communication is just horrible \ud83d\ude05. Planets can affect so many things, especially Mercury the plant of communication. Like on Dec 12th until Jan 2nd we will have a retrograde where communication will be affected, like horribly. But by knowing this in advance we can know that this time period we need to watch what we say and how we say it because others may take it wrong or we may just say it wrong. This can bolster our actions rather than create reactions.\n\nYou both will over come this. You're trying to fix your communication. You're trying to work on issues. I hope she can see the work you're doing and come around to work with you. <3"]}
