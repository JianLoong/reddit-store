She should stop that.

I was like you living in the Stone Age with an alarm clock. But there is a solution that should not cost anything. Use your phone set the alarm on vibrate and put it under the pillow. It will wake you up but not anyone else. Been doing this for years now and wife loves it too. So I can sneak out of bed and go to the gym. If the whole phone under pillow is not an option they have clocks with a vibrate pad that goes under the pillow cheap on Amazon. About 25$. Also. Stop using the snooze. It actually make you more tiered. Learn to get out as soon as the alarm goes off.

It should be you vs the problem, not each other.\n\nIf you try the vibrating alarm and she still wakes up (which is what happened with me) then she might consider sleeping in another room.   I went that route after accepting that my sleep issues couldn\u2019t be solved with those adjustments to the alarm only, and the only way I can guarantee sleep is by sleeping alone with white noise, no movement, and it being cold as a morgue. \n\nGood luck!", "I'm going to abstain from any side of NTA/YTA.

So what's your proposed solution? If you have a job that pays well, you can afford a base level garmin, fitbit, etc that's significantly cheaper than an apple watch", "ESH.

She's also being unreasonable by not meeting you halfway, like getting earplugs or something.", "I\u2019m going against the grain with YTA.

Thank you for your thoughts :)", "Lolol thank you :)", "> It sucks at first, but getting an extra hour in the morning to do whatever you want has been one of my favorite discoveries as an adult.\n\nI'm with you there. I've had people become aghast when I told them what time I get up. But having an hour that I can just sip coffee and fart around before I have to get ready puts me in a better mood all day.", "FitBits do this", "those don't work for me, I am just not aware of them going off, tbh. \n\nif she is a light sleeper it could be as little as the act of getting up.", "Not out of character after for her to complain like that lol.", "You realize that doesn't wake most people up right?", "This is a huge overreaction to an everyday annoyance that many couples experience. Also, you do realize she also works, right?", "I feel like that\u2019s why it\u2019s a YTA. It\u2019s an easily fixable problem that he\u2019s refusing to fix.", "You're not in the wrong at all imo, but I do empathize with your wife. Maybe set two alarms, and the first can just be vibration? If possible. Idk, I'd say try to accommodate her if you can, but an apple watch might be a bit much, maybe a cheaper version though.", "I'd venture to say millions of people sleep with a watch on. You forget you're wearing it after a short while", "So long as you aren't waking your spouse an hour early, best of luck!", "plz my ffxiv raid group are all americans and our raid times are 4-6am for me so my alarms go off at an awful time LMAO", "At least he had chicken.", "Did he just go in there?!", "how it's making you feel.", "I neither know nor care.", "Those don\u2019t work for everyone. I can sleep through my watch and even my phone have a vibrating alarm. It\u2019s simply not enough to pull me out of my sleep cycle. \n\nHe has already made a significant compromise on not hitting snooze. Why should he be the only one to compromise?", "OP already compromised & isn\u2019t snoozing the alarm. His wife can compromise now & wear earplugs.", "Then I'd suggest you get a dog and a cat. *They* will hear the alarm and start pestering you to get up. This is how it works in our house.", "I don't even work anymore (retired) and I wake up before 5 every damn day no matter what time I go to bed. ugh...", "I\u2019d always been a big sleeper until my girlfriend and I got a puppy and we had to start trading off and on who would wake up at 4-5 am to take her out. \n\nI was 100% miserable the first few weeks, but now that the puppy is grown I kind of miss having a reason to be up before everyone else. Like you said, make a big breakfast and some coffee, read a book, do some laundry, and it\u2019s still only 6:30 am haha", "i love my fitbit cause it vibrates on my wrist, only cost me about $60, wakes me up every time and even though it sometimes wakes up my partner, it isn\u2019t as disruptive as a sound alarm", "Obviously I wasn\u2019t being literal \nSo what\u2019s the compromise they should get separate bedrooms and delay the inevitable?\nThe fact that she works is irrelevant, if she had to get up earlier would she be ok with him complaining  about her alarm. \nIt\u2019s a symbol of a bigger sense of entitlement that\u2019s waiting down the road.", "That's what I'm leaning towards. A ton of comments are saying she should go to sleep / wake up earlier or sleep somewhere else as if that's the easier solution. \n\nOP made no mention of how their sleep schedule compares and we have no idea what their living situation is like. So for all they know, sleeping somewhere else may entail someone sleeping on the couch or getting a place with an additional bedroom. As if that's easier and cheaper than buying a simple watch", "Where is her compromise?  What has she done but complain but he actually did change something just to be complained about something else.", "Maybe the OP should encourage the wife to play WoW, then they would get up at the same time. She could raid and get through all the drama, OP could work and keep up her subscription, I think it\u2019s a win/win", "Okay but he doesn\u2019t know if it will work or not because he hasn\u2019t tried it. Marriage isn\u2019t always about compromise, it\u2019s about collaboration. Why not collaborate with his wife to find a solution which works for both of them?", "Haha my cat alarm is NOT reliable for a certain time.  I mean she will wake me up, but it could be anywhere from 1 minute to 4 hours before my alarm.", "I think Fitbit is a great idea. Thank you :)", "Maybe it's because I care about my SO, but if I wake her up early everyday, I wouldn't blame her or say she needs to figure it out. OP isn't saying why he can't by a watch, he just says he doesn't want to. Wife is dealing with the same unresolved issue: being woken up in the first place", "The family that raids together stays together.", "And why can\u2019t the wife collaborate? She\u2019s doing a lot of complaining and not a lot of problem solving. He\u2019s already made changes to compromise and tried to help.", "Wife hasn't tried sleeping on the couch, either.  That's just as silly as being mad at your spouse for getting up for \\*checks notes\\* work.", "If you always take your pill at 4 pm and give you cat a treat at the same time, your cat will remind you when to take your pill at 4 PM!", "He didn't she complained 1st about hearing the alarm over and over next it was hearing the alarm at all so when he gets one that vibrates and she complains because she's still gunna get woke up sometimes when he gets up.  What has she done to work with him?", "agree", "Agreed. She sounds insufferable. The guy is trying and yet she hasn\u2019t tried anything whatsoever. It\u2019s funny how compromise is always used but only when it refers to the guy having to make changes to accommodate his spouse or everyone else around him.", "What on earth could she do? She\u2019s suggesting solutions, she\u2019s trying to problem solve. There is still the same problem that she\u2019s getting woken up, which him not snoozing the alarm hadn\u2019t solved.", "Usually, but not always.   Also they don't uderstand time changes", "Hate to break it to you, but relationships aren't a one to one trade off. It isn't \"I did X so you do Y.\" If there's something you're doing that bothers your partner and has an extremely simple solution, you do it because it helps them. They'll appreciate it. \n\nYou're 100% guessing she would be woken up still and ignoring the chance she stays asleep most days. Based off OP's follow up comments, guess what? He's looking into a watch.", "she could try, oh idk,,, waking up also. starting her day at the same time.", "True.  Hopefully we can get rid of DST soon."]}
