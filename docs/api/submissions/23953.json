This is the first grandchild on both sides of our family, so all of us are quite excited. My sister-in-law has started planning for the baby shower, and was hoping that she could coordinate with my mom (the only woman in my immediate family of 5). \n\nMy mom has indicated to us that she does not need to be part of the planning as she has her own ceremony planned toward the end of the pregnancy. As she explained the details of the ceremony, it sounded very traditional and adhering to strict customs, involving several members of extended family that neither me nor my wife know very well.\n\nMy wife has suffered from an anxiety disorder for most of her life, in part, we believe, from a toxic parental dynamic as a child in her home. I won't share too much, but to convey how serious it was, her stepfather refused to acknowledge her existence, even when they're in the same room, for several years because she dated someone outside of their racial background. \n\nAnyway, my wife's anxiety is being managed with medication but can be triggered in several different ways. We tried to talk to my mom and inform her that the ceremony would be distressing for my wife, and asked if we could adapt it into the shower my sister-in-law is planning in a way that would make my wife more comfortable. \n\nMy mother is firmly against this, insisting that she would rather cancel the ceremony and be \"heartbroken.\" The conversation became heated, with my mom using tactics that I would liken to emotional blackmail, and me saying that she was holding the importance of tradition over the wellbeing of her daughter-in-law. My wife added in that she really wanted the families to come together in planning the shower, which is why we suggested integrating the ritual into that event. My mom took this as making it an us versus them type of situation, which is not what we intended. \n\nI think that we could be the assholes in denying my mom of her vision of the ceremony. My mom immigrated a long time ago and has been starved of a lot of her cultural celebrations. She was really hoping to do this ceremony by the book, and I can't hold that against her. We are trying really hard to have it done as close to her vision as possible, but she defaults to cancelling it altogether rather than adapting it.\n\nMy wife's anxiety is currently through the roof as a result of this confrontational conversation. She thinks she should just go through with the ritual, despite knowing that it will be difficult. I'm worried about her. I'm worried about our baby. \n\nWe agreed to a phone call tomorrow morning, giving both sides a day to cool off before talking it through again.

(as in wife and unborn child)\n\nObviously your mom refuses to change anything of this ceremony, and instead of trying to explain how she's definitely probably not the bad guy on reddit, decide how you'll shut her down, because there is little to no chance that she'll cool off and change her mind.\n\nSo do you have what it takes to say no to her outlandish demands, or will you sacrifice your wife's mental well-being to appease your mother?", "Thank you for clarifying. My wife and I have both been on the same page about trying to compromise, as my wife understands how important this event would be to my mom, despite her discomfort. Does she need to be this gracious given the situation? I can't say.", ">you sound like you'd be willing to throw your wife under the bus to please your mother.\n\nHow on earth do you come to this conclusion after reading the post? I said my mom was emotionally blackmailing us. I told her to her face that she cared more about her tradition than my wife. Despite all of this, in all of her grace, my wife has still wanted to compromise because she knows how much this means to my mom. I am not pressuring her into compromising, and I would (and have) gone to bat when a line is crossed. \n\nI am prepared to walk away from the ceremony if we can't find common ground. The question is if I would be the asshole in doing so.", "If I may so bold to answer that\u2026 does she need to be this gracious?\n\nNo. No she does not at all. Speaking as a wife and mother, pregnancy is the absolute hardest on our bodies. Our bodies are literally accommodating our growing baby/babies, our hormones are accommodating the baby. Even our center of gravity is off. We stress about the birth, the health of our baby, our own health, what kind of mother we will be, whether we will be able to nurse (if that\u2019s how we\u2019ve chosen to feed our baby). I can go on and on. Then we will give birth. Whether it\u2019s vaginal or c section it is TRAUMA on our physical and emotional selves. Then, we are handed a newborn baby that may or may not have feeding issues, will be waking us at all hours to feed and be diapered. And we will feed our baby all while passing blood clots the size of lemons through our bruised and stitched genitals. It will hurt to sit. Our nipples will hurt. Our uteruses will cramp to reduce back to normal size. Our hormones will be falling rapidly. Your wife might wake in a puddle of sweat three days after giving birth. This cannot begin to describe the change in your wife and all the things she will need to accommodate. And during this post partem period. This precious time when you will meet your new child and want to be supporting your wife physically and emotionally, you do NOT want to ADD any unnecessary stress on her. You just don\u2019t. It isn\u2019t up to your wife to be the gracious one here. It is on your mom. If your mom won\u2019t compromise, that is on HER. Do not put that guilt on your wife. Please. Because if I had to guess, the only reason your wife is offering a compromise despite her discomfort is because she is worried about hurting YOU and your feelings in the matter.", "The problem is your wife wants to make you happy. She thinks that refusing this ceremony will drive a wedge between your mom and you. So she's trying to compromise.  But your mom will push and push and push until she gets EVERYTHING she wants and nothing your wife wants. \n\nYou need to see this. You need to shut this down, walk away, and assure your wife that this is not destroying your relationship with your mom.", "INFO: is it a seemantham/godh barai/shrimant (Indian baby shower)? Bc if so, it's long and boring and I'd skip it entirely (that said, you generally do get pretty sizeable cash gifts)", "Why would you participate in a religious ceremony when you don\u2019t practice the religion?", "You gave your mom two options: \n\n1) Do the ceremony in a way that your wife is comfortable with\n\n2) No ceremony\n\nYour mom has chosen \u201cno ceremony\u201d. That is her **choice** to make of her own free will, you guys are not making her not do the ceremony. *She* decided not to. **It is NOT your fault if your mother CHOOSES to get upset by her own decision to not do any ceremony.**\n\nThat\u2019s the end of that, then. NTA. \n\n> I think that we could be the assholes in denying my mom of her vision of the ceremony\n\n*Her* vision for a ceremony for *your wife\u2019s* pregnancy, that requires *your wife* to be the main participant? Frankly your mom\u2019s wants just don\u2019t matter compared your wife\u2019s in this situation. It\u2019s your wife\u2019s pregnancy. Your mom already got to do her pregnancy her way, she needs to step back and let your wife do what she\u2019s comfortable with. \n\nHonestly you might benefit from reading the books \u201c[Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents: How to Heal from Distant, Rejecting, Or Self-Involved Parents](https://www.amazon.com/Adult-Children-Emotionally-Immature-Parents/dp/1626251703)\u201d and \u201c[Boundaries: When to Say Yes, How to Say No to Take Control of Your Life](https://www.amazon.com/Boundaries-When-Take-Control-Your/dp/0310247454)\u201d. You guys are married and about to be parents- you **need** to learn how to set firm boundaries with your mom and not fall for her guilt tripping if you want to be able to have a decent relationship between her and your growing family.", "Exactly! You are dragging this out by \u201cnegotiating\u201d when your wife is clearly uncomfortable with it. Her anxiety must be through the roof at this point, waiting for the outcome! This is not healthy for mom or baby. Please just tell your mother no!", "Fully agree, he is just asking how to handle a tricky situation and not hurt feelings more than necessary", "Gracious? Your wife has been more than gracious. She has gone beyond gracious. \n\nTell your wife there is no wrong answer to *you*, and that you will support her decision what ever it is. Ask your wife if this ceremony was suggested by anyone but your mom, would she have been willing to go along with it or would she had declined to participate. \n\nI bet she will say she doesn't want to do it. \n\nThis is the battle to fight. Because if you do not enforce the boundaries with mom now, she will take it as license to continue to violate your wife's peace. Right now mom is pushing to get her way and is not respecting the no.", "You're saying she's trying to compromise because she wants to make me happy, and I've already said this is not the reason. \n\nYou are also assuming my mother is pushy about a lot of things, and this is also not true. My mom has stayed out of our marriage by and large, with this being one of maybe two exceptions.\n\nI understand that you want to help, but making assumptions like these are not helpful.", "You're not seeing it, but we are.", "NTA. Your mother can have any ceremony she wants to - doesn't mean your wife is obligated to attend. Your wife's mental health is being affected here. This is a perfect example of \"Don't set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm.\"\n\nI AM curious about the nature of the ceremony. I've heard of many traditions around a new baby, but not one that involves the mother before the baby is even born.", "This is not your mom's baby. Your mom does not get a vote.

Your wife will resent you for it if you don't put a foot down.  Grow a spine, tell your mother it's added to the shower or not at all.", "NTA\nYou say you are worried about your wife and baby so tell your mother no.

Do not leave your wife alone with her.", "NTA\n\nHonestly, you've been more than charitable to your mother this entire time, because **she's not the one starting a family.** I get it, she immigrated, and shockingly when you immigrate you wind up in a culture that isn't your own and that sucks I guess, but she's just the grandmother. She isn't entitled to a \"ceremony\" and you even talking about it in the prospects of doing it is entirely you being charitable, and not an obligation."]}
