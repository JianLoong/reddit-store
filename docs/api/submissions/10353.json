I (25f) and my husband (25m) have been married for 4.5 years together for 6 and have always dreamed about having kids. Trying to be as responsible about bringing kids into the equation as we could, we wanted to wait until we were financially, emotionally and logistically ready to have kids and we finally decided that this was the year that everything lined up perfectly & it was go time and we couldn\u2019t be more excited! I briefly mentioned it to my family who were nothing but excited and supportive as they love my husband and in their opinions this has been a long time coming. This is where my sister (28f) comes into play. She recently got engaged to her fianc\u00e9 (29m) at the end of December, with plans of getting married December of this year. Yesterday we wedding dress shopping & had an amazing time and ended up finding her dream dress. On our way home I asked if they had thought about a timeline on when they would want kids & she said \u201cabout a year\u201d and then decided to follow it up with her saying she knew I was trying to get pregnant and that it was \u201chorrifically selfish\u201d and a terrible sister for wanting to start trying before her wedding, and that it hurt her & her fianc\u00e9s feelings that my husband and I didn\u2019t consult them or consider their feelings. She said \u201cyou\u2019ve already waited 6 years (will be 7 by her wedding) what\u2019s another 10 months? When asked why it was such a big issue to her she stated it was because she wanted us to use the open bar at the wedding even though they\u2019re not big drinkers. I understand wanting the wedding day to be all about you and not wanting to have your pregnant baby sister taking attention away from you, but I also feel like completely changing our life plans and plans for a family that we\u2019ve been waiting years for, for one day for them seems kind of wild as well.

Live your life at YOUR speed.", "The title makes it sound like you were attempting to reproduce at the wedding. Maybe she\u2019s already preggers and wants to give birth first.   The bar thing sounds like a pathetic excuse. Nta.  Your life choices are none of her business. Don\u2019t ever let her manipulate you like that in anything.", "NTA.  If she mentions it again, suggest that she put her wedding on hold for another year or two until after you\u2019ve had a baby. See how that goes over.", "Lordy\u2026. NTA but your sister can get bent. How dare she even try to say anything at all about your plans. It is completely irrelevant to their wedding planning. It may mean a different bridesmaids dress but, damn. How selfish can she be?", "NTA\n\nHow does your being pregnant in any way make a difference to having an open bar at her wedding?

It never occurred to me to have an opinion.", "Yeah, NTA - It's her wedding, why would you put your life effectively on hold for one day out of her life.

And Good Luck and Congratulations on deciding to start a family!!!", "NTA.  I actually had to read the action because I didn\u2019t under  set hand the whole paragraph+ you wrote.  But the it is 2:30 in the morning.  But honest to God, why do brides think they control the universe?  I wish you luck getting pregnant and it would really be great if you went into labor on the day/week/month she owns.", "As long as you are not like having sex in a public space at her wedding and causing a scene by being caught, NTA. I'm very confused as to what her problem is. She says it's selfish of you to try and get pregnant before her wedding because she wants to have an open bar? How do those things have anything to do with each other? She does know that if YOU get pregnant that it doesn't mean that no one can drink right? Like she does understand that a pregnant you being around alcohol and people drinking is not going to harm your pregnant self? Please tell me I'm just not understanding her reasoning", "NTA. Enjoy dealing with Bridezilla cause she's gonna get worse.", "NTA. I don't know if she's worried that your pregnancy will steal her spotlight, or if she's concerned you can't fit in a bridesmaid's dress.

Did I read that correctly?", "NTA\n\nAnd that is the stupidest shit I've ever heard of and my issue with big to do weddings. People seem to forget its supposed to be about joining together in matrimony, not a chance for you to be the princess for the day. Geesh. Move ahead with your planning, she can piss off.

Hope she grows up soon.", "Your sister is unreasonable and she and her fiancee need to calm themselves down.

Don't change your plans because of the wedding. Honestly, people (especially brides) place waaaay too much importance on their special day for the rest of us!", "What. \n\nNTA \n\nYour sister is being ridiculous.

Keep doing your thing. Your sister is way out of line. I would firmly tell her that it\u2019s not up for\ndiscussion or negotiation if she brings it up again. Getting pregnant can take a long time even without fertility issues. Don\u2019t let this impact your timeline. Also\u2014 does she maybe have an issue with alcohol abuse? Her inability to imagine you having a great time sober is a red flag. If someone is uncomfortable with people NOT drinking it usually is more about their own issues.", "NTA - from your description, it sounds like she didn't want you to be pregnant at all versus so close to delivering that you might miss her wedding.

She doesn\u2019t get to dictate your life. And pressuring you to wait to try to get pregnant so you can drink at her wedding is ridiculous.
