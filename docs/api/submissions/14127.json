(37m) her 8 years of my life (20-28) we were friends with her 3 years before that and all was well. But it got worse when Ian told me he cheated on a girl he met at a bar because he was drunk and crazy. I had my life planned with this man. Then we tried to sort it out, but rumours spread that the girl was pregnant and was planning to have a baby. After that, we got desperate and went to couples therapy and counselling But by then it was too late and the marriage had just ended.\u00a0 \n\nYears later, my friend \"Mai\" met a group of friends and said they were planning to go on a group trip to Monaco. Now Ian is from Monaco and I am from Trinidad. His family lived there, so we lived together. I was worried about this choice and talked to Mai, but she said don't worry, Monaco is small but big enough not to worry about seeing him. I decided not to worry. \n\nUpon arriving in Monaco, we decided to go to our hotel and prepare to leave. Mai and Ian were friends before Ian and I started dating, and Mai and I were her neighbours before she moved to Germany. When we went to the hotel, we went to our room to change, and when we got off, Mai broke out of the group and went to the restaurant in the building. I found this strange because she chose to stay in a place without a house and she didn't ask anyone for directions. \n\nWhen she returned, she said she had a \"change of plans\" and had to wait for someone to arrive. We all started questioning them, asking who was waiting for them and why.\n\nShe dodged her question by saying it was just a surprise. 5 minutes later Ian and his driver and his son (5m) walked in through the front door of the hotel. Surprisingly, no one was shocked, everyone greeted him and welcomed him by saying that they hadn't seen each other in a long time. I just stood there, surprised and incredulous. After that, we all formed a circle, decided, and talked about something. \n\nWhen they finished Ian slowly approached me with his son and tried to introduce me to his son. Now I quickly closed it and was very cold for Ian. It failed One time, I took one look at my friend and went back to my room to pack. Shortly after, Mai came into my room and started apologizing for everything she had done to ease the tension between Ian and me so that Ian and his son could come to us anytime. Then she saw me packing and asked what I was doing there. I said I was done and I was packing to go home (NYC). She tried to convince me not to do it and called all our friends to do it too but I was pretty stubborn and it didn't work. So now I'm writing this Meanwhile, I'm waiting for the driver to go to the airport. Everyone is blowing up my phone, urging me to change my mind and stop being so stubborn.

This was a very shitty thing for Mai to do. She should have obeyed your wishes and not lied to you about what she was going to do. If she and some other friends absolutely had to see him on this trip they should have given you a heads up and made it for one afternoon under circumstances you wouldn\u2019t have to have contact with him. And unless your ex was seriously misled by Mai, which seems possible, he\u2019s really foolish for believing you would welcome him.\n\nThat said, I personally would have found another way to handle it. In your place I would recognize how blessed I was by being able to not see a hated ex because he lives a continent away, like many less fortunate people who have to navigate living in the same small town as them and run into them everywhere. And I would have made an effort to preserve my vacation and my friendship by telling your ex in front of Everyone that you don\u2019t know what Mai told him but you don\u2019t want to see him or his son, it still hurts, and your one express stipulation to Mai for coming was that you didn\u2019t have to see him. I would have called out Mai then and there, shamed her, and told all of them that you were going home unless they agree to keep him the hell away from you and, while you never said they have to stop being friends with him, if this vacation was intended to spend a lot of time with him, you were invited under false pretenses and they can either choose one day to spend with him without you or you are making other travel plans that don\u2019t involve them. If they do the right thing, great. If not, go to Milan or Marseilles or Barcelona and leave their awful asses behind.\n\nBut of course you were blindsided, didn\u2019t have time to process or think and going home is reasonable. I\u2019m just offering another alternative.", "NTA, what the f#ck do these people think they were doing?! \n\nYou go home, girl, and enjoy yourself. Block them and find some new friends.", "NAH. The boy is 5? So you should have got over that long ago. If you didn't, you can't fault other people for thinking so.\n\nYou didn't have to be all smiles, but you could have held your own, and made the best of the night. \n\nHe certainly moved on. Why didn't you? That's why therapy exists. \n\nYou're being dramatic with the whole \"I'm going home\" and packing. \n\nI can't say you're the TA because you were trapped. Friends not the TA because they didn't know you'd freak out after all this time.
