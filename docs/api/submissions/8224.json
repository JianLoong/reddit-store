As others have pointed out, you want a surprise - you plan it around the person you want to surprise and not just rely on their ability/willingness to abandon all plans at your first request, no questions asked.  \n\n\nIt sounds like a nice plan etc., and assuming you're referring to 'now' and you asked her about the date essentially 2 months in advance - it doesn't hurt to ask. *BUT, I'd say, you thought of the date - ask her about the date before making an elaborate plan*. So the 'YTA' part is asking her after making all the plans and immediately ruining the surprise when she said she couldn't do it. Besides, if you know she'd need to get away from work on that day (and you'd have to ask her to clear the day in advance, which essentially gives away that you're planning something special), was it really that necessary to stick to that date? **IMO a proper surprise would not require her to save the date several months in advance (and leaving her to speculate as to what you're planning, which would probably land her on the right conclusion anyway).**  \n\n\n**A question for you, OP**: if your GF came to you and randomly asked you to skip work (\"clear the day\") on a certain day in the future, would you be eager to do that, just like that, without questions?

It is a little odd that your SO couldn\u2019t plan a day off that far in advance, but since we do not know what she does, I am going to assume based on her protests that it is something where taking a day off means a loss of income and where she may have recurring client appointments scheduled all year long, such as being a masseuse or chiropractor or beautician. Regardless, you are supposed to plan the proposal around her availability, especially if you wanted to have an element of surprise.

The goal is to minimize revenue loss and client dissatisfaction, and for that reason, therapists in their field generally plan time off in advance. Which is why someone in this area would be hesitant to just jump the gun for time off without much notice.

If all this symbolism was so important to you, why not plan the date weeks ahead so she had time to adjust?  \n\nIt sounds like you wanted the ego boost of the great proposal and don\u2019t really care how it affected her life as long as you got credit for being romantic.  YTA", "Honestly it's just one day, I don't think she's the one buddy.. I see people are saying that you should work around her but no you shouldn't have too. If it were me I'd definitely take the day off just to spend it with my man! In the end I get a nice surprise that I didn't know about!

They've judged my entire character and relationship on ONE negative event.", ">Why would you be surprised that somebody can't just take a day off work on your whim?\n\nIs it really a whim if he's asking her nearly 2 months in advance?\n\nI agree he didn't need to react as he did, but surely 2 months is more than enough time to clear a day off and rearrange things. I also do agree he can propose another day, but it's not like he asked her last minute.", "Completely agree. I lost sight of what's important. I sincerely wanted to give my SO the romantic purposal she always wanted. The date doesn't matter at all. I see that clearly now.", "Okay. I gave her three months advanced notice. She has canceled/moved clients with less advanced notice than that. The economic impact isn't lost on me. We've planned and worked on budgeting.

It felt fair to ask her to clear the date given she had moved/canceled clients around with less notice.", "I asked three months in advance. She has moved/canceled clients with less notice.

She cannot possibly take a day off, two months in advance, because of client commitments? As someone who works with clients signing contracts on a daily basis, I call BS on this one. It's very, very rare to have meetings and commitments set in stone two months in advance. The GF is well within her right to say no, but she should be honest. Saying 'I don't want to take a day off' is a 100% valid statement. Saying 'I can't take the day off because of clients' is pretty damned close to a lie, this far in advance.", "It's incredible how some people feel qualified to make such bold statements about people with so little knowledge.

Us jumping up and down over how cute your plans were? Wrong sub for that.\n2nd, of course your character is getting judged on that single event.

And sorry not sorry but guilting the other party for not going your way is ALWAYS an AH move as well as manipulative.", "INFO: How many times have you expected your GF to \"clear her calendar\" for you?

Her boyfriend ought to know the basics of her business and not expect her to be able to cancel clients at a moment\u2019s notice.", "Nice!", "Why is that so unbelievable? My last job was a patient-based job (doctor's office), not a client-based one, but two months notice definitely wouldn't have been enough time to get a specific day there either. We were fully booked every day and working with a staff of 5 that, on our busiest days, needed every person on staff in the office to keep things going.

Maybe she's a popular hairstylist or tattoo artist and books six plus months out. Maybe she's a therapist with no openings to reschedule anyone.
