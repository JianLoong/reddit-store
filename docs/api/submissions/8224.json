As others have pointed out, you want a surprise - you plan it around the person you want to surprise and not just rely on their ability/willingness to abandon all plans at your first request, no questions asked.  \n\n\nIt sounds like a nice plan etc., and assuming you're referring to 'now' and you asked her about the date essentially 2 months in advance - it doesn't hurt to ask. *BUT, I'd say, you thought of the date - ask her about the date before making an elaborate plan*. So the 'YTA' part is asking her after making all the plans and immediately ruining the surprise when she said she couldn't do it. Besides, if you know she'd need to get away from work on that day (and you'd have to ask her to clear the day in advance, which essentially gives away that you're planning something special), was it really that necessary to stick to that date? **IMO a proper surprise would not require her to save the date several months in advance (and leaving her to speculate as to what you're planning, which would probably land her on the right conclusion anyway).**  \n\n\n**A question for you, OP**: if your GF came to you and randomly asked you to skip work (\"clear the day\") on a certain day in the future, would you be eager to do that, just like that, without questions?

It is a little odd that your SO couldn\u2019t plan a day off that far in advance, but since we do not know what she does, I am going to assume based on her protests that it is something where taking a day off means a loss of income and where she may have recurring client appointments scheduled all year long, such as being a masseuse or chiropractor or beautician.

The goal is to minimize revenue loss and client dissatisfaction, and for that reason, therapists in their field generally plan time off in advance. Which is why someone in this area would be hesitant to just jump the gun for time off without much notice.

So I can understand why he doesn't want it to be a \"made you dinner, marry me\" scenario. He wants it to be a day of both of them doing something more special than \"just\" a dinner together, a day that's remembered in its entirety and can't be summed up in a sentence.\n\nHe is the AH for not taking a no after the second time she said she wouldn't do it, and making *her* feel bad about not being able to take a no by pretty much telling her why he wanted her to take the day off. Which, given the situation, is highly ironic.", "Because that wasn't his plan to do it after making dinner??? He said he had a nice day planned at the flower conservatory, why are you trying to tell him he should do it another way?", "It reminds me of a story my SO told me. When he was a kid, he and his siblings were acting up while in the car with their mom. She punished them by telling them that she has a big surprise planned for them, but because they were misbehaving, she said that the surprise was cancelled. To this day, he doesn\u2019t know if she was made the whole thing up just to fuck with them, but it always bothered him. \n\nThis guy was trying to punish his girlfriend by spoiling the surprise because she didn\u2019t go along with his plan. He\u2019s def the asshole.", "Right? And she said it would cost her a lot of money, so it sounds as if she's not on salary but works on commission (or hourly). When my DH was on commission/hourly, I never called him during the work day (except emergencies) or tried to get him to take time off when sales were tight. It directly affected his, and therefore our, income. I don't understand partners who get huffy when their SO can't chitchat with them during their work day!", "If she said no to taking the day off because of money reasons, why wouldn\u2019t he be more understanding and pick another date? It\u2019s a proposal not a contract. It\u2019s meant to be a heartwarming moment, not an argument", "It might depend on her line of work. If she's in accounting, late March would be full swing tax time. Every tax accountant I've ever known has been completely swamped during tax time and taking even one day off during that time would do incredible damage to her career - most big firms (idk about smaller ones) specifically give you incentives you can use during the rest of the year (like racking up additional vacation time or bonus pay with your tax season overtime) to make up for it because the expectation is that you and your job Become As One for the duration of tax time and it sucks but everyone has to do it.", "She has a client-facing job, so she may have had appointments already scheduled for that day that she would have to reschedule.", "Because she's not a mind reader and was probably thinking that she needed the money.", "exactly, can\u2019t expect too much from this guy lmao", "When I did shift work, if I decided against working a day all I could see was a pile of cash on fire (my missed earnings) \ud83d\ude05 so it\u2019d take a lot for me to take the day off.

Don't beat yourself up. Keep a good head and you'll find your true love.", "He was more excited about the appearance of the proposal than the person he is proposing to. He's treating her like a prop in his little fantasy.\n\nHe is not ready to get married.", "yeah, i\u2019m curious to know why she apparently got so upset when he asked this since it was such a big notice?", "I've learned from some very insightful posts here. People reading my post seemed to have inserted a very negative perception of how the event went down. This event took place back in December of 2022. I figured at least three months of advaced notice to save the date was appropriate. She has canceled on clients/moved dates around before without it being a problem. I didn't expect her reaction. Our fight wasn't nasty, we didnt yell or say nasty things to each other.\n\nI never spoiled details, but when she said \"What could be so important that you'd ask me to take a Monday off?\" I told her I wanted to start that date as the beginning of a new chapter for us. She instantly knew what I was talking about. We have a very wonderful relationship. She was stressed about money with the baby on the way. I've told her that we have enough to provide a loving family for our children. Plenty of families have raised their kids on* less. \n\nI also recognize that the Flower Conservatory isn't open on Monday. The plan was to purpose at it, not inside. I wanted to have that place be the spot where I purposed and have thewedding ceremony later. If they gate off the entire area then I didn't know that detail. \ud83d\ude2a", "Yeah it's 2 month notice - but what if that's an extremely busy time of year for her and so even with a lot of warning it's crazy to take time off without a very good reason? Like for example if she was an accountant.", "There's a Schitt's Creek episode exactly like that -- Patrick pushes David to go on a steep hike, David whines, Patrick injures himself -- but the proposal happens anyway.", "Oooh wow! If you don\u2019t mind me asking, what castle? I love visiting castles and it would be great to have another to add to the bucket list.", "Right? And if my SO was asking me THREE  ONTHS IN ADVANCE to take a specific day off work for an unspecified reason I\u2019d have a good idea why and I\u2019d schedule it.", "Because in adultland, there are other days you can spend a whole days with your person? March 20th is a Monday for fuck's sake. It's not like she booked herself for a weekend, and if she works with clients, she's likely going to fuck with some of her financial relationships by moving all those pre-booked appointments around, especially if she tends to be packed like my hairstylist is - she had to open herself up for two whole weekend days to compensate for the appointments she had when she was sick for one. If Monday is that important to this dude, then he needs to do it after work. If his future wife is important to him, than he needs to plan his surprises around her job, or at least understand how tf her job actually works.", "Who knows if OP would have offered to pick up a weekend of work himself to compensate. Its 60 days notice and one day of work. If op is the AH for trying to plan a nice day with the woman he wants to marry thats bizzare\n\n* Also \"IF\" she said no because of money issues.\". Stick to facts in the post not made up nonsense", "I was completely thinking she was an accountant as well. That or a lawyer with trial dates in March she can't easily change.", "I said this elsewhere, but her unwillingness to not take a random day off because her SO \"playfully\" asks her to for no apparent reason doesn't necessarily mean she never takes a day off.  It means she won't just do whatever her SO wants her to.", "Oh so like, if you wanted to take off a day in March, scheduling that in January seems perfectly fine, which is what op asked their so to do. I really struggle to imagine a job where it is impossible to take off for one day with months notice.", "You do know you could have just done it literally the day before the Vernal Equinox and been like, \"It's almost spring and I'd like it to be the beginning of a new chapter for us,\" instead of getting hung up on the exact day?", "Lol I\u2019d be pissed if my partner told me to take a day off work to go stand *outside* a flower conservatory (not even inside it to enjoy the space afterwards) and propose. I\u2019d rather be asked in pajamas in my living room without an actual ring. I hope for your girlfriends sake that she doesn\u2019t feel the same way.

Also \u201cwho knows if OP would have offered to pick up a weekend of work himself to compensate,\u201d you should follow your own advice and stick to the facts in the post and not make up your own scenarios to excuse OP\u2019s blunder.\n\nI would not take off work without a good reason. OP needed to at least make up a reason if he wanted his fianc\u00e9 to take off a day at work. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice day to go to the conservatory\u201d is not a good enough reason. The Sunday before would probably have been just as nice a day to go and she wouldn\u2019t have to reschedule clients or miss out on work. From the fianc\u00e9\u2019s perspective, she had no good reason to take off work and she\u2019s not in the wrong to not take that monetary loss when OP gave no indication of why she should take that hit.", "I\u2019m not making anything up. She directly says to him \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of money I\u2019d be missing out on.\u201d Sounds like she has an issue with not receiving this money, and as it\u2019s her life she\u2019s entitled to feel that. He is an AH for not backing down and picking another day. She didn\u2019t know it was for a proposal, remember. She was just thinking he was asking her to take a day off. Plus she\u2019s \u201cpossibly\u201d pregnant and may be very hormonal (could be regardless really). He then manipulated her by revealing it was meant to be for a proposing instead of just picking another date. \n\nIt\u2019s bizzare that he couldn\u2019t see the strain he\u2019s putting on his girlfriend over something as simplistic as a proposal date.

To her it sounds like \u201cI know you have to pay bills and you only make money by seeing a bunch of clients but please cancel a bunch of clients and their money to chill with me for the day just because I feel like it\u201d. Reguardless of how \u201cimportant\u201d her job might be to you, she clearly values it.", "Lmao to thinking \"fuck\" makes you sound tough, stay in sunday school friend", "Hopefully she will be able to go on a 24 hour honeymoon so she won't miss any clients! Also if he bought a ring to propose, wants to get married all of these things are expensive and they live in San Francisco one of the MOST expensive places to live. I'd be willing to bet one day off of work is not going to put her on the street. I know plenty of people that have extremly important and time consuming jobs, none of them would freak out over taking one day off of work.
