You\u2019re the one proposing. You have to plan AROUND her. Not get mad at her when she tells you she\u2019ll be preoccupied. Yes maybe it was the perfect date. Guess what? Any date will be perfect if you really love her because it\u2019s the day you decide you want to be together forever. \nYou\u2019re immature for not just picking another day, revealing it was meant to be a proposal is such a guilt trip.", "YTA. You weaponized the proposal against her because you were pissed that she didn't immediately agree to take a day off work and lose money so you could make the proposal all about what *you* wanted. \n\nYou're not mature enough to get married.", "You know what you were doing. The fight was escalating and you were losing because you had no real reason to ask her to take the day off. You were pissed off and wanted to hurt her in the moment. You ruined what could of been a very special moment and made her feel terrible about it. You were suppose to plan AROUND HER. \n\nYTA", "> Pick another date and stop being so butt hurt about a plan not working out?\n\nYTA. You just answered what you could\u2019ve done better.", "Yta - she didn't even have to take off the day - you were going to propose that evening. You don't take her job seriously \"just forget about your clients\" and you're still upset she wouldn't take a random day off on your say so when you \"playfully\" asked.", "YTA. \n\nI don\u2019t know what field she works in but can you imagine if she was a mental health counselor or therapist? And had to tell all of her clients who need help, \u201csorry, off today\u201d for no good reason? Most jobs can fill empty spots like that with someone else to take the job for the day but some can\u2019t.", "You really couldn't have just said something polite that wouldn't bring about guilt? Something like, \"I'm planning a little surprise for you, and the date is relevant. I know it's on a work day, but I'm hoping we can make it work?\"\n\nLike damn. Yeah, YTA for ruining your proposal and making HER feel bad about it. L.", "YTA. Nice idea but asking someone to take off work for no explanation or coordination with the job in secret was a mistake.", "Yeah YTA. You made it all about what you want or need. Why did she have to take an entire day off? Work is obviously important with her clients. Why not pick a day off she can take? Why then make her feel bad about something she didn't know you wanted to do? You made it sound like just blow work off. If there are plenty of days to pick from you should have just done that instead of picking a fight and turning it on her.", "YTA you should be planning around her work roster do it on a day where she's actually not working.", "YTA. Why should she choose this arbitrarily chosen day over her career?", "YTA for parachuting in this specific date because of Reasons, rather than finding a date that suited her. You sabotaged yourself here, I'm afraid.", "YTA. A huge one. You asked if a specific date would be ok, and the answer was no. A non-AH would have said, \"OK, what date would work?\" instead of being an AH.", "YTA. I think you know why, but for some reason, you're still too self-centered about it. \n\nYou're generally dismissive of her, controlling of her reaction and seem self-aggrandizing.", "Bro, you already know.... YTA", "YTA save the perfect spring date for the MARRIAGE not the engagement date that no one even remembers.", "YTA. Your intentions were good but to be honest surprises stop being fun after a certain age. Like depending on her job, client relationship is very important so yeah one day could make or break a relationship.", "YTA\n\nPlan your proposal on her day off, don't ask her to take a day off work for no apparent reason.\n\nYou  telling her about your planned proposal was also a bit guilt tripping, manipulative and seems like you wanted to make her feel bad for not taking a day off work.", "YTA - Sounds like you care more about the proposal than the person you were proposing to.", "YTA\n\nYou should have dropped it. Why would you think she'd just be ok not working for a day & losing that money without giving her a reason?", "YTA\n\nShe had absolutely no way of knowing why you wanted her to take the day off. And honestly? A proposal is not enough of a reason to take a whole day off work (IMO). You should have planned around her schedule if you really wanted it to be a surprise on that specific day. And honestly how dare you leverage \"I was going to propose!!!\" as a way to get out of a fight, which you caused and from her perspective was you just being completely unreasonable about her job. That you're \"still salty\" she didn't just immediately obey you and take the day off is the shit icing on this asshole cake.", "YTA. When you work with clients and you \u201cforget about them\u201d for one day when already have them booked, you won\u2019t have that problem again because they won\u2019t be clients any more.", "YTA. If I was her, I might be reconsidering the relationship. You seriously just said I care more about doing this on a specific date than I care about your career or feelings. No, she can't just cancel on clients. No you didn't have to tell her you were planning on proposing and make her feel bad. And no, she does not have to \"just give us a day off together\". I'm sure you have days off together. Do it on a day you are both off! How hard is that?", "YTA - you know there's a fun surprise happening, but she just heard you ask to cancel all her income that day and you got mad at her for asking for an explanation.", "Of course you're TA. People can't just take time off work on a whim - especially since she had no idea this was an important day.\n\nI feel sorry for her. \n\na) you should feel bad and b) get over the saltiness. You're sulking because life didn't go exactly the way you want. You're sounding either very young or very self-centred.", "Another AH who thinks women should pick up romance over career, and punishes them when they don't.", "My fianc\u00e9 proposed to me when we were on acid. He had made the ring (I used to unbend paper clips at my previous job for anxiety so he took one of the metal wires and bent it to a ring) the night prior as I was passed out next to a bowl of my own puke \n\nThat was literally perfect. YTA. Anything you do will be perfect if you love her enough", "YTA you can\u2019t expect her to give up a day of work because you\u2019ve made plans. You should have dropped it and picked another date,", "YTA. If you're planning a surprise, the first thing you do is find out when the surprisee is free and make that the day. Not pick a day and force the surprisee to be free that day.", "YTA. She has a job and, like the majority of people I imagine, can\u2019t just take days off to suit her SO. Instead of dropping it, you argued and then told her what you had planned. It didn\u2019t matter if it was the very first day of spring or her first day off in spring, you could have kept quiet and proposed another day.", "YTA", "YTA. Why would she take a day off if she is busy and to her it just seems like a random day without anything super special happening. From her point of view I would have said we can just go there on the weekend sometime instead of taking a day off.", "YTA You ruined it, not her. You should have made an easier plan to pull off and not expected her to take a day off. Hope you didn't screw yup your relationship over this.", "YTA. You asked if she could take a day off of work, she said she couldn\u2019t. You had the opportunity to then plan around her work schedule.", "YTA.\n\nIf this is really about your \"absolute stunning day\" that you had planned, why didn't you first ask her on what day she would be available to take off? That would've made your surprise and actual surprise.", "YTA\n\nSo you spoilt the surprise and made her feel bad about herself when she had no idea of the plans you were making? A proposal is supposed to be a surprise, you could\u2019ve made some form of excuse asking her to take it off or maybe you should have asked further in advance to ensure she could get that day off.", "Gently, YTA.\n\nIt stinks when things don\u2019t work out the way we planned. During my proposal, a lady at a table near us was getting properly wasted and loudly wailing most of dinner. It took a moment for me to figure out how I was going to salvage the evening.\n\nWas the night what I expected? Not at all. But a proposal is about the woman (or man) that you love. Things have a way of still being magical when the moment comes around, even if it\u2019s a little late.\n\nPick a different day. It will still be lovely, even if it\u2019s perfectly imperfect.", "YTA \n\nShe was working. She had no idea what you were planning and now she feels like shit for spoiling it, when in reality: You spoilt it.\n\nETA: no matter how you \u201cfix\u201d this. She will ALWAYS remember that she \u201cspoilt\u201d your first attempt.", "YTA. It sounds like she can\u2019t easily just cancel on clients - this is her livelihood. Why didn\u2019t you communicate with her to find a day that works for both of you? And then secretly plan the proposal around that? Nice sentiment that it\u2019s the first day of spring or whatever but there are other priorities, clearly.", "YTA", "YTA. pick a day she already has off.", "Yta", "YTA. \n\nhow about you show some respect for her time and her work (and her clients)? your expectation for her to just drop everything because you want to, without her even knowing the reason, is very childish and self centered. grow up.", "It sounds like you didn't give her a reason? \nCancel a day just because? \nWhy not \"can you take the 20th, I've planned a romantic getaway for us\"? \nYTA", "ESH\n\nPeople seem to skip the tiny detail here that he's talking about the ***20th of March***. That's almost two months in the future.\n\nThe OP is an AH for dealing with this situation rather poorly. I mean the first thing you should have done is make sure she could attend and blurting out you were going to propose, comes across as vindictive.\n\nHowever, she is an AH for having a reaction that doesn't even remotely justify the cause. If you're going to bite off your own SO's head off just because he asked about taking a holiday off 2 months ahead, you have issues. The conclusion that can be drawn from this is that apparently she can never take days off and that the OP's wish was doomed regardless of what he did.\n\nI get the impression that the girlfriend is under a lot of stress and decided to use OP as her verbal punching bag.", "NAH, but you did have a brief, understandable lapse.  You should know your intended well enough to know if she is working hard and would struggle to take off a day from work.\n\nBut it's a mistake anyone could make and you corrected it.  It shouldn't continue to cast a pall over the proceedings.\n\nI think it's lovely you planned a proposal and I hope you both have a wonderful marriage.", "*\"That's okay my little pumpkin dumplin'...I will surprise you w/ another proposal.

I definitely get your side of it but I also get her side of it, especially because she didn\u2019t initially know about the proposal and the actual reason why you asked her to take the day off. She\u2019s right to be upset about missing a day of work (money) and canceling on clients. Plan your proposal around a day that she has off.", "I totally get that first day of spring and the thought you put into it all so sweet and so romantic. I don\u2019t think you should of told her about the proposal. Your SO getting that upset because you asked her to take the day off was kinda silly and turning into a fight was just unnecessary. But never mind, pick another day now and propose. All the best to you both!", "Thank you to everyone who posted! There has been some very insightful and/or helpful comments.

You couldn\u2019t plan a proposal when it wasn\u2019t inconvenient for her? Because it is inconvenient for someone to be asked to take a day off of work for no reason.

Everyday is perfect day for proposal. Why can't you propose when she is done with her work?

Not anything.

Thanks for the posst, reminded me it's been 17 years for 'us' and my SO had to learn 'how' to surprise me too.  NO unexplained demands, NO 'shocks', but tons of little unexpected gifts with \"you can have me return it if you don't like it.\"  I recommend this approach, its really fun for both of us :).  I used to HATE surprises, but given with this kind of thoughftulness I've come to love them.  Good luck.", "How so? Because she didn\u2019t want to take off work and cancel on clients for no reason? I\u2019d be annoyed if my partner did this too. It\u2019s very selfish to not plan the proposal around her schedule"]}
