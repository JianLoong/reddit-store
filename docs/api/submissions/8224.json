As others have pointed out, you want a surprise - you plan it around the person you want to surprise and not just rely on their ability/willingness to abandon all plans at your first request, no questions asked.  \n\n\nIt sounds like a nice plan etc., and assuming you're referring to 'now' and you asked her about the date essentially 2 months in advance - it doesn't hurt to ask. *BUT, I'd say, you thought of the date - ask her about the date before making an elaborate plan*. So the 'YTA' part is asking her after making all the plans and immediately ruining the surprise when she said she couldn't do it. Besides, if you know she'd need to get away from work on that day (and you'd have to ask her to clear the day in advance, which essentially gives away that you're planning something special), was it really that necessary to stick to that date? **IMO a proper surprise would not require her to save the date several months in advance (and leaving her to speculate as to what you're planning, which would probably land her on the right conclusion anyway).**  \n\n\n**A question for you, OP**: if your GF came to you and randomly asked you to skip work (\"clear the day\") on a certain day in the future, would you be eager to do that, just like that, without questions?

It is a little odd that your SO couldn\u2019t plan a day off that far in advance, but since we do not know what she does, I am going to assume based on her protests that it is something where taking a day off means a loss of income and where she may have recurring client appointments scheduled all year long, such as being a masseuse or chiropractor or beautician. Regardless, you are supposed to plan the proposal around her availability, especially if you wanted to have an element of surprise.

Forcing your way into a proposal that only fits what you want and not her schedule is such a great trait for a partner. /s", "YTA\n\n\"Am I the asshole? Should I have just dropped it before it got into a fight? Pick another date and stop being so butt hurt about a plan not working out?\"\n\nYes, yes and yes.", "Surprise proposal? Really? It\u2019s 2023. Enough with this antiquated bullshit.", "YTA, can I just take a guess and say that you were planning on making a big social media thing about this so you looked like such a perfect person. I bet you won\u2019t post this on any other platform other than here because people will think of you as a jerk.", "INFO - is this going to be how you treat her career and work after marriage? Or is this just the way you always treat it - that it takes a back seat to whatever tf YOU want to do?", "YTA for making your proposal about you and then telling your SO you were going to propose thus ruining any future proposal.  You made your SO feel guilty which is even worse.", "I would NTA, I get it, she doesn't want to take the day off at first but everyone expects the proposer to do all the work, well sometimes it takes cooperation to get the time right, to make sure they're free for that day. Especially since he was trying to get a good day for it. NTA but it could have been avoided. This stuff is honestly difficult to go through", "Nta none of you is the asshole this is just a misunderstanding. It happens in a relationship.", "ESH - you should've planned out farther in advance for her to take the day off if you needed it to be that day of the week. She needs to realize that one day isn't going to ruin her career and if it is, she needs to find a new one lol.", "This should be higher. I wish I had an award for you. It says it on their website too. Open Tues - Sun", "but he PLANNED an absolutely stunning day!", "I also don't understand the point in spoiling the surprise if he was going to pick a new date anyways. He was butt hurt and petty. Not great signs in a partner.", "Or stick to the day and just do something after her work !", "It isn\u2019t even all about money, she had client commitments", "[removed]", "Best comment. YTA OP for deliberately hurting her when she didn\u2019t immediately bend to what you wanted. You should think about why you had that reaction before getting married. Also, no matter how you propose now, the memory of this will still be in the background.", "Also, OP is still nursing the grudge even though gf clearly felt bad.", "Yeah but that would have been sensible, it's a bit much to ask /s", "Exactly. If she already has clients booked in that day, she may lose important business if she cancels.\n\nIt sounds like it was multiple clients too. Cancelling one appointment is one thing, rearranging what will realistically be several days, once she squeezes those clients in elsewhere, for what you initially portrayed as a random fun day off... Not going to happen.\n\nAlso OP, ever consider that the stability of her business might be more important to your lives together than the particular date on which you propose? You're sounding dismissive and disrespectful of her livelihood.", "I felt the same. This is not going away so easily. Even when he does propose, he\u2019s already ruined the whole experience.", "Tbf one day off isn\u2019t going to ruin her career, on the other hand I\u2019m sure she has days off in the during the week or weekend he could\u2019ve chosen", "Another commenter pointed out the conservatory isn\u2019t even open on 3/20, so OP has this elaborate \u201cplan\u201d that wouldn\u2019t have worked even if she took the day off. Surprise!", "He didn't even actually put any effort in to plan anything. The conservatory is closed March 20.", "Yeah this is what I most agree with. How much notice in advance does she actually need to be able to take a day off? Two months notice isn\u2019t unreasonable at all. \n\nI would actually work this out with her because it can become a big problem, one of my ex\u2019s would never even ask for time off work (because he didn\u2019t think he\u2019d get it) and we were never able to do anything nice together. It was a part of why he\u2019s now an ex.", "I feel like her job is not going to allow her to have a healthy work-life balance. That in itself could be detrimental to this long term relationship.", "He is TA for guilt tripping her by revealing the proposal plans.", "this dude is asking her to take a day off from her already scheduled clients but can't be bothered to even make sure the venue is open that day", "I hope he enjoys playing second-fiddle to her job. If it\u2019s that difficult for her to take a day off with two-months notice, she will never be able to take extended time to be with him.", "Did you see the comment from CarterPFly saying the conservatory isn\u2019t even open on March 20th? \n\nHours at the bottom of the page. https://conservatoryofflowers.org\n\nIt\u2019s a cute idea to propose on the first day of spring and her reaction seems a bit extreme when you gave 2 months notice, but you shouldn\u2019t have escalated it further and spoiled the proposal. YTA I guess, for being rigid and partly for not even checking the date availability with the venue before asking her to take the day off.", "The conservatory isn\u2019t even open March 20th. They aren\u2019t open on Mondays period. OP made a huge stink about this but didn\u2019t even check if it worked for literally anyone in this scenario besides themself, because this proposal is not for OP\u2019s girlfriend, but themself.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates [Rule 1: Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/). Further incidents may result in a ban.\n\n[\"Why do I have to be civil in a sub about assholes?\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_civility)\n\n**[Message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.**", "Unless she's just that obsessive that she has never taken a single day's vacation (which happens, but if that's the case I recommend OP not marry her anyway), I'm guessing that she already has something scheduled for that day with a client. Two months out is plenty of time to plan one day off if all that's happening is routine work.", "oh my.. so much for meticulous planning and effort!"]}
