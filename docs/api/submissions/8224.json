As others have pointed out, you want a surprise - you plan it around the person you want to surprise and not just rely on their ability/willingness to abandon all plans at your first request, no questions asked.  \n\n\nIt sounds like a nice plan etc., and assuming you're referring to 'now' and you asked her about the date essentially 2 months in advance - it doesn't hurt to ask. *BUT, I'd say, you thought of the date - ask her about the date before making an elaborate plan*. So the 'YTA' part is asking her after making all the plans and immediately ruining the surprise when she said she couldn't do it. Besides, if you know she'd need to get away from work on that day (and you'd have to ask her to clear the day in advance, which essentially gives away that you're planning something special), was it really that necessary to stick to that date? **IMO a proper surprise would not require her to save the date several months in advance (and leaving her to speculate as to what you're planning, which would probably land her on the right conclusion anyway).**  \n\n\n**A question for you, OP**: if your GF came to you and randomly asked you to skip work (\"clear the day\") on a certain day in the future, would you be eager to do that, just like that, without questions?

It is a little odd that your SO couldn\u2019t plan a day off that far in advance, but since we do not know what she does, I am going to assume based on her protests that it is something where taking a day off means a loss of income and where she may have recurring client appointments scheduled all year long, such as being a masseuse or chiropractor or beautician. Regardless, you are supposed to plan the proposal around her availability, especially if you wanted to have an element of surprise.

They aren\u2019t scheduling appointments that week and then cancelling. \n\nA day off is an obvious necessity during times of emergency or sickness, and that can\u2019t (and shouldn\u2019t) be avoided. The goal is to minimize revenue loss and client dissatisfaction, and for that reason, therapists in their field generally plan time off in advance. Which is why someone in this area would be hesitant to just jump the gun for time off without much notice. It results in creating more work for them (cancelling, rescheduling, hoping those who reschedule don\u2019t request an already filled time slot, missing out on pay which some especially rely on if it\u2019s a private practice) when it really isn\u2019t needed.", "If he cared that much he should have looked on the website to see it is closed on Mondays and March 20th is a Monday.\nHe hadnt put that much thought into it he just wanted the reaction.", "And it made her obviously upset!
