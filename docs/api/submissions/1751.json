Our situations are all similar but also very different. I left home at 16 due to my mother's and sister's mental health issues making life unbearable and the house a borderline biohazard. Paula left home due to neglect, and Cathy left Foster care due to it being too unstable for her. \n\nCathy is about 7 months pregnant with her first baby. She has something called hyperemesis gravidarum and SPD, and I don't know too much about babies or pregnancy, but I know she's really struggling, physically and mentally. I know HG is pretty much just chronic constant morning sickness. Shes pretty sensitive to smells and the sight of certain foods.\n\nI work in a small restaurant as a dishwasher, and I live in Europe so there's no tipping culture here, so whenever a tip is sent into the kitchen it gets decided among all 5 of the kitchen staff. It rarely happens but when it does its a good day. That happened this evening, we had a group of American tourists in who sent in a \u20ac50 tip and it was split amongst us. I was really excited about this because all my money goes on bills and groceries, so I was finally able to treat myself. \n\nI got a meal from the local thai restaurant and I was very excited for it. I got home and left it in the kitchen when I went to lock my cat into my room (upstairs) (he's a cunt and will try to steal my beef). In the fucking two minutes it took me to get back to the kitchen, Cathy threw it in the *outside* bin because she said she could smell it from her (downstairs) bedroom and it was making her want to throw up. \n\nI got really mad, because its the first time I've been able to get myself something like that in about 6 months, and I even though I didn't raise my voice, I did call her a bitch, and told her I've restricted what I eat for so long to avoid making her sick. I told her this is the one thing I was looking forward to all day and now she's gone and ruined it for me. She cried.\n\nI left the house, but Cathy called and reminded me I had promised to help her build the babies crib this evening, because it needs to get done before baby comes. I did promise, and I hate breaking promises but I don't wanna go back home tonight. Paula texted and said Cathy has been crying and stressing all evening which might be bad for the baby, and she thinks that's making me an asshole, fir putting unnecessary stress on Cathy. AITA?\n\nEdit: moving out/finding a different place to live isn't an option. I'm paying \u2153 of the market rate in my area for one room, and I'm able to keep my cat. I also have a pretty great landlady, and she's sent someone in to fix broken appliances within 24hrs of finding out something is broken.

However, when you are pregnant you do have some crazy emotions going on. Since you want to continue living there and if you want to forgive Cathy , I would call Paula back and say you need some space tonight and that you will help with the crib later. Sounds like the three of you are making the best of difficult circumstances and none of you came from normal home lives. Among the most functional homes there is conflict sometimes and forgiveness, compromises and mutual respect goes a long way.

However you mentioned in a comment that she threw it out without even telling you or giving you the option to eat it outside.

NTA.", "OP, You are definitely NTA. That means you did nothing wrong and Cathy was very wrong to throw away your food AND then be upset/trying to hold you to fixing the crib.\n\nBUT I'm going way softer than most of the replies here. I agree that you do not owe Cathy anything, and she should replace your meal if it's at all financially possible for her. Here's where I soften up. All three of you are fending for yourselves at a very young age. You have a good living arrangement, that has been put onto more stressful footing because of this pregnancy. The more you (with no underlying guilt) can still be kind and supportive to one another, the better for all three of you.\n\nYou had every right to be upset and need to get out that evening. You have nothing to apologize for. She does. However, it would be very helpful if you can go back to the apartment and talk calmly with both your roommates.\n\nYou can note that you realize how hard this pregnancy is on Cathy and that you and Paula have been and are trying your best to support her. But that you are also a person with needs and who has your own struggles. She took something away from you in just two minutes that was very hard for you to get and which you had no chance to enjoy. While you and Paula generally try to avoid things that upset her, she can't just throw away your stuff. The three of you need to agree on a plan if that happens again. (Maybe she simply lets you know and whoever can more easily leave the apartment does so.) She wanted your help with the crib. You want to help, but you are not an emotionless robot. She really hurt you that night and can't expect you to turn around and work for her. She has to recognize you have your own stresses and need space, and that you and Paula are not her spouse. You help because you three care for each other, but if you need to take care of yourself sometime; she needs to respect that. Let Paula know, you share her care for Cathy. But that evening, Paula could have chosen to help build the crib if she felt so concerned or she could have gently reminded Cathy that you both are helping her but have your own needs, too.\n\nThe three of you are also going to have to have a separate series of honest discussions of what will happen when the baby comes. You've had a good roommate relationship prior to the pregnancy, but it may or may not be something you can sustain with a baby. What adjustments are you and Paula willing to make (they don't have to be exactly the same)? What things are you willing to help Cathy out with? What are your limitations or boundaries you need Cathy to respect? What does Cathy need to do for herself and the baby? Can she do those things? What other helping resources does Cathy have? You may find that you cannot agree on how things can work and would have a hard time happily living together. If that's the case, how do you three handle the decision of who leaves the lease? How can you make it as kind a transition as possible? This will not be an easy chain of conversations to have, but you need to face what's ahead. Good wishes to all of you.", "NTA. Crib can be built later. She's 7 months so crib didn't need to built that night. Sounds like trying to shift the guilt.to you.

If I were you I'd be as blunt as you can and tell her that you don't want anything else to do with her preganancy or her baby. Because you know that if you don't distance yourself now, you'll be called upon to just watch the baby while she has a shower/goes to the shop/ has a nap/ visits her mum/friend/boyfriend/ etc etc etc. If you allow her to overstep into your life, she will guilt you into all kinds of babysitting and feeding duties.", "Nta.
