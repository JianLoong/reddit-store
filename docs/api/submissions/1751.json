Our situations are all similar but also very different. I left home at 16 due to my mother's and sister's mental health issues making life unbearable and the house a borderline biohazard. Paula left home due to neglect, and Cathy left Foster care due to it being too unstable for her. \n\nCathy is about 7 months pregnant with her first baby. She has something called hyperemesis gravidarum and SPD, and I don't know too much about babies or pregnancy, but I know she's really struggling, physically and mentally. I know HG is pretty much just chronic constant morning sickness. Shes pretty sensitive to smells and the sight of certain foods.\n\nI work in a small restaurant as a dishwasher, and I live in Europe so there's no tipping culture here, so whenever a tip is sent into the kitchen it gets decided among all 5 of the kitchen staff. It rarely happens but when it does its a good day. That happened this evening, we had a group of American tourists in who sent in a \u20ac50 tip and it was split amongst us. I was really excited about this because all my money goes on bills and groceries, so I was finally able to treat myself. \n\nI got a meal from the local thai restaurant and I was very excited for it. I got home and left it in the kitchen when I went to lock my cat into my room (upstairs) (he's a cunt and will try to steal my beef). In the fucking two minutes it took me to get back to the kitchen, Cathy threw it in the *outside* bin because she said she could smell it from her (downstairs) bedroom and it was making her want to throw up. \n\nI got really mad, because its the first time I've been able to get myself something like that in about 6 months, and I even though I didn't raise my voice, I did call her a bitch, and told her I've restricted what I eat for so long to avoid making her sick. I told her this is the one thing I was looking forward to all day and now she's gone and ruined it for me. She cried.\n\nI left the house, but Cathy called and reminded me I had promised to help her build the babies crib this evening, because it needs to get done before baby comes. I did promise, and I hate breaking promises but I don't wanna go back home tonight. Paula texted and said Cathy has been crying and stressing all evening which might be bad for the baby, and she thinks that's making me an asshole, fir putting unnecessary stress on Cathy.
