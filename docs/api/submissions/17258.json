He just hasn't said anything about it.  It's like I said above where she's damaged her relationship with him.\n\nThere were times I picked him up (in the past) where he was crying because she yelled at him for different things - being sad, for example because apparently he \"doesn't know what it means to be sad because he's just a kid and she has real depression\" or because he wants to do something at my house but not with her and she hates that, etc...\n\nThat's kind of why I asked, though.  I'd rather him be in a safe, happy place here and I love spending time with him but, ugh, it's also Mother's Day and it bothers the fuck out of me that she's not doing anything about it.  And I guess I worry if it's bothering him at all on some level even though we're hanging out and chatting while he plays video games.", "Same.  It's a large part of why I continued to work through the courts.  I hated seeing his mistreatment.", "I don't think she'll take it out on him, based on what I know of their interactions.  I think worst (?) case is she makes up some excuses or something.  Pretty sure he sees through all of that these days and has for a while now.", "Right?  I go in the year before to mark down on my online calendar for any holidays I have him or she has him so I know when I get him.  This wouldn't be the first time she's missed holidays with him.  It's just - how do you forget it's Mother's Day?", "Thank you for your perspective!  We're having a great day so far. I just wanted some outside thoughts in case I was being a jerk about the whole thing despite everything that has happened before.", "The slowly burning scent of the bridge between her and my son makes enough of a smell at this point.", "Thank you. That's my thought but the little voice at the back of my head had me second guessing whether I was being an asshole or not. I wouldn't care if it's that other holidays.", "Exactly.", "Also, unless she never leaves the house, how could she not know it\u2019s Mother\u2019s Day. Every retail outlet beats you over the head with advertising for weeks in advance.", "Based on everything I know about him and things he's said or done, no, I think he prefers being here right now.", "Yeah.  Even if he doesn't outwardly show it.  We mostly spent the day hanging out in chunks.  It's been a good day.", "You're very kind, thank you very much.  I just wish she'd done the same thing and put everything aside to focus her attention on our kid.  The fact that she can't is one of the biggest reasons I divorced her.  I just hate the damage it caused our son.", "I'll be the one with an unpopular opinion. She doesn't care. I wouldn't place an idea into his head that he must be with her this on this day or celebrate her or anything about it. He doesn't need the guilt and as a little kid he doesn't know he shouldn't feel guilty. Save him from years and decades of honoring someone. So much stress involved.", "Do you have full custody of him? If not, are you planning to?\n\nlast question, does your son want to keep contact with his mother? Or does he utterly just hate her", "I\u2019d ask your son these questions outright.", "Well she would have to care about being a mother first. But based on some of your other comments, I don\u2019t think she cares about that.", "Sad.", "And she also has a second, younger child with someone else and is always around her sister who also has a child.  Really not sure how you miss that except that part of her whole deal is how selfish and doesn't spend a lot of time and attention and energy on others.", "Then nta. As long as you aren't setting your kid up for disappointment you're good. But I can imagine it sucks feeling like your mom forgot about you, especially if she did. If that's going to hurt him then I'd say just bite the bullet and remind her. No you shouldn't have to do it, but that's not really the point.", "That's fair.  I just spent time with him and didn't pressure him with anything.  He's 15 now and he's been dealing with her behaviors for a while now so I think he can handle himself if she throws a fit later at him.  \n\nShe (and her sister) used to try to directly trash talk me in directly to him back when he was 7 and I'd just carefully talk him through it, mostly just getting him to make his own opinions based on the actions of the people (myself but he probably connected that towards his mother on his own) rather than what people say.  \n\nSo, actions speak louder than words and she's unfortunately been bad at both.  Since then I've just tried to shelter him from all of the conflict when he's around me and just focus on my time with him.  Which is easy since he's a fantastic kid.", "Not full custody since she isn't *that* terrible.  But, I do have him like, uhh... 80% of the time?  All due to her behaviors.\n\nAnd I wouldn't say he hates her, but he's made it pretty clear that he doesn't especially enjoy spending time with her.", "Yeah.  That's one of the biggest parts of why I divorced her in the first place :(", "No! Because if you're THaT despondent you need heavy meds and heavy therapy, my friend. We'll just get you a nice comfy room", "Pretty sure he's over it at this point, based on interactions with him.  He purposefully schedules activities around when I have him.\n\nAn even more recent example was talking about a 4 day school break coming up later this month.  He thought it was on his mom's weekend but when I pointed out that it was mine he said, in a happy voice, \"Oh, cool!\"\n\nSo.  Yeah.", "Lol, NTA. No, you're not responsible for reminding her of her own parenting plan.", "Your son is probably in his room hoping she forgets. I understand you feel bad about this but this is about your son. Your ex only matters in the context of your son. Go give him a hug if he's cool with that. Remind him dad loves him.", "I mean... yelling at him for being sad seems pretty damn abusive to me.", "Honestly sounds like your doing both jobs of mom and dad... and shes just kinda \"there\" .... so happy mothers day!", "INFO \n\nHow badly does your son want to see her", "You can't change her and it's better to support him in accepting his mother is like this. Do not push him on that just be a safe space as he processes.\n\nNagging her into being in his life will only hurt him by giving him a false sense of how important he is to her.\n\nYES it'll bother him! It *hurts* to have a mother like this. It *hurts* to have a mother who doesn't care that he's crying. It *hurts* to have a mother who is three hours late and probably just forget him.\n\nIt hurts less to have a safe space to process this and not try and force a false relationship."]}
