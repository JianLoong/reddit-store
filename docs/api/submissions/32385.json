I recently had my daughter. When I was close to my due date my older sister asked me if I had any ideas for what I wanted to name my daughter. I told her that my Husband and I were still bouncing around names but a name we really liked and was at the top of our list was \u201cElla\u201d not using real name for privacy.  My sister then says \u201cif I had another daughter I would name her Ella\u201d. I admit I didn\u2019t think much of that statement mainly because I wasn\u2019t being 1. Thoughtful and 2. My sister has a baby girl but is currently not in a relationship and is a single Mom. Side note I\u2019ve asked my sister if she wanted more kids at one point and she said she didn\u2019t know. I just want to make it very clear my sister is not pregnant and is not expecting a baby.  Fast forward I give birth to my daughter and my Husband and I take a look at our list and look at our daughter and \u201c Ella\u201d was the name we kept coming back to.  I also want to say we had been talking about this name for months before I even told me sister. I visited my family after birth my sister never asks to hold the baby and won\u2019t talk to me. I was confused as to what I did after weeks of her giving me the cold shoulder I asked my Mom if my sister was angry. I didn\u2019t want to ask my sister because in the past that has made her more upset with me. Nevertheless, I asked my Mom and she tells me that she\u2019s not allowed to tell me what my sister is angry about. This really made me feel anxious and I start playing out every interaction I had with my sister. Embarrassingly it took me a long time to realize that she may have been mad about the name. I kept second guessing because I brought up the name \u201c Ella\u201d first.  A couple weeks go by and in a conversation with my Mom I ask her about if my sister was upset about my daughters name.  I know I crossed the line here in asking my Mom about this but my Mom let me know that my sister had told her that \u201c Ella\u201d was the name that she would name her second daughter if she had one. My sister did not tell my Mom that I was the one to first bring up the name.  Now I feel like crap that I should have been more thoughtful and contacted my sister before naming our daughter. Part of me I\u2019m frustrated though because it hurt to have the cold shoulder after just giving birth. Also, I just felt like it wasn\u2019t that great to tell my Mom half of the story because it made it seem like I heard the name she liked and stole it. Part of me feels like my sister would do something like hearing the name I liked thought it was cute and decided in that moment that she wanted that name. I don\u2019t know maybe I did steal the name AITA? Also, I won\u2019t ever be sharing names again I\u2019ve learned my lesson.", "created_utc": 1701760567, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18b6ibr/aita_named_my_child_a_name_my_sister_liked_now/", "score": 29, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
