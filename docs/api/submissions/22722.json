He argued a lot and told me it was normal to give it out when customers needed help. I asked him to use my business card or direct them to our agency website where I have 2 office phones, work cell, and email readily available.

We work at different agencies and he had my money prior to me being employed at my current agency.

They're EEO and they called the customer just to informally figure out who gave them the number. The customer  named him specifically, EEO friend let me know. I texted the guy and was like yeah it was you lol... laughing it off and sticking to \"just give them my business card, please do not give out my private number.\" He raged texted for 3 hours.
