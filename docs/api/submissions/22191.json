That is embarrassing", "YTA\n\nYour stepsiblings are still your siblings. You're like saying you wouldn't treat an adopted child as your own family just because you're not biologically related. Also your step siblings are quite young, ofc they will feel hurt and unwelcomed when an a wholeass adult will discriminate them.", "YTA, because your behavior of giving extra attention will eventually lead to the step kids finding retaliation against your sister and damaging their relationship. It\u2019s ok to not want to buy the others gifts, but think about the effects being the favorite will have on your younger sister.", "YTA. Everyone saying NTA clearly don\u2019t have sympathy or empathy towards kids. \u201cYeah, you love your step sister but she doesn\u2019t see yous as actual siblings or loves you as much as her REAL sibling, that\u2019s why she doesn\u2019t give you gifts\u201d\n\nHow fucking disgusting do you have to be to even think that is right? In any capacity?", "I have a srep-family who have been in my life for 32 years. I do not consider them my family nor do they consider me family. This is my mother's husband's family, not mine. I think people try way too hard to force step-parents and their families onto their children. It's okay to have a cordial relationship with someone who your parent made the choice to force into your life, but you are not required to consider them family. This is where true resentment and dislike for a step- family occurs, forced relationships. \nNTA", "INFO: Did the step siblings ever give you gifts? Or since they're younger, did they at least wish you well on your special occasions like birthdays?", "It's a complicated situation. On one hand, you're not accountable for your step-siblings, but on the other hand, it deeply upsets them when you clearly show favoritism towards your sister solely because she's your biological relative. Just imagine being a 9-year-old and witnessing someone you consider part of your family receiving more love and attention than you due to blood ties. This dynamic can disrupt the sibling relationship and significantly damage their self-esteem at such a young age. I wouldn't go as far as to label you an AH, but perhaps you could make an effort to at least spend some money on a gift for your younger step-sister. After all, she's your little sister and these gestures can have a profound impact on her well-being.", "YTA overall\n\nI don't think it's right to show clear favouritism. These kids are young still, they might feel insecure because of the way you treat one over others.\n\nWould it be possible  to get a little something each for your stepsiblings too? It doesnt have to be grand, just something to make them feel included. As a stepchild myself it really really makes the difference. I feel a lot less alienated this way, and i'm grateful.\n\nHowever, your sister is clearly very important to you. It's great you have a bond with her!! You're free to treat her as much as you like (obviously)!! Your bond with her is super nice :)\n\nNTA for treating your sister, but YTA for completely excluding your stepsiblings. It hurts. And, hurting two people weighs more than spoiling one.\n\n(Also, if you've known them for 6 whole years, that's even worse. They feel unwanted by you. It's not nice.)\n\nediting:\n\na lot of the comments say you shouldnt feel inclined to give anything to the stepchildren. While I agree that you don't have to and they arent really related to you, it would just be a nice thing to do considering you're making a large effort to spoil your actual sister. It doesnt take much.\n\nIf you can't give anything to the stepsiblings (i get that you might not have unlimited funds which is absolutely ok) you could easily give it to your sister in private. Or, if you're feeling kind, allow them to share.\n\nYou dont have to see them as siblings either \\[which i think is a really key point\\] . You can just see them as the children of your mothers husband (or whatever is happening). But, you don't have to exclude them", "NTA. You don\u2019t need to get gifts for your mom\u2019s chosen family members. That\u2019s her job. You are 22yo and have expenses. Kudos for prioritizing your sister.", "NTA. You decide whom you want to bring a gift. It is your money and you spend it as you see fit.\n\nYou didn't choose for your stepsiblings to be a part of your life. Your mother can't expect you to love/like them equally to your bio sister. Stepsibling relationships should never be forced by the parents. That can't result in a healthy relationship. You lived with your stepsiblings for three years when you were 15. That is normally not an age where children would develop sibling like love for \"strange\" kids. I think it is totally normal that you treat your bio sister different, as long as you're not mean etc to your stepsiblings.", "YTA, not because you owe these kids anything, but because you're fostering a nasty environment in a house you no longer even live in by being an ass about this.  Stop it.", "NTA\nYou only have known them since you were 16 and you moved out when you were 19. 3 years vs 8 is a big difference.\n\nMaybe bring them some small gifts to keep the peace but you have no obligation.

You're the older sister, not the parent which a lot of these Y-T-As think is the same as adopting your step siblings apparently.", "INFO: how long have they been your step siblings? This matters for the judgement, as the longer you have known them, the more asshole-ish this makes you.", "I think he is feeding and creating resentments between the brothers. They are children and because they are children they will clearly understand that you don't like them, but your sister. What will happen is that in the future you will be remembered by them as the person who came to the house, bringing gifts for the other and not for all of them. Don't expect to have any kind of relationship in the future with your step brothers if you keep this up.", "NTA. You don't have to buy anything for anyone you don't want to. But maybe make sure to give her gifts in private.", "How long have they been your siblings? \n\nHow long ago did you leave for college?\n\nIf they are reletivly new as siblings and you did not have a lot of interaction with them before you left home, it is understandable why you favor your sister, as you know her more and have an established relationship with her.", "INFO: How long have they been your step siblings?

She probably doesn't conceptualise why she's less special to you and I can empathize with her/your mum's point. Your mum's also probably not trying to stop you from having a good relationship with your sister but doesn't want resentment between your sister and step siblings because you've in a certain way made your sister the golden child.", "NTA.

Your little sister is the one who has to live with them for at least another 7 years and you\u2019re contributing to them resenting her. You can buy whatever for whomever, but you need to change the way you handle it to not make your sister\u2019s situation harder. The gifts/public favoritism might make her happy short-term, but they\u2019re harmful long-term.", "YTA- you\u2019re not obligated to gift your step siblings anything but you are an asshole for doing this. They\u2019re children. Instead of caring for all three like I would (since they are all children), you\u2019re purposefully causing a rift. No matter the relationship you have with your step father, I think the step kids deserve kindness from their older sibling aka you. But just my opinion. Why blatantly show favouritism when you can just be kind to everyone? There must be some kind of resentment OP is harbouring for her to be acting this way.", "YTA. 6 years? So that little girl has known you for 2/3 of her entire life? The gifts don't have to be expensive. I used to get my niece and nephew Christmas gifts but then get their step siblings like a stocking stuffer level gift. Usually something cheap but gimmicky like silly string or a ridiculously large lollipop. \n\nThey're kids. Of course they're going to be hurt.", "YTA  \nNo one says you have to care about step-siblings but you are creating problems between your sister and the other 2 kids that she lives with on a daily basis and will for the next 7+ years.", "This is really tough. I get you have a closer bond with your sister and that\u2019s totally understandable and normal. I think the 15 year old probably gets it and if they don\u2019t they need to get a grip but it\u2019s kinda harsh on the 9 year old. I have two children from a previous relationship (10 and 8) plus an almost 2 year old with my current partner. My partner doesn\u2019t treat the older kids the same as his daughter, because they aren\u2019t his kids. He spends less money on them and takes his daughter out without them. But he loves them and buys them treats, has boys night with them and whatever else. So in reality they don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re treated differently. His family treat all three children exactly the same. I get it\u2019s different because you aren\u2019t in a parental role but the 9 year old will feel rejected for reasons completely out of their control. And no kid needs to grow up feeling that way. Would it really be so hard to grab them a box of candy so they have something too? Take the younger ones out for ice-cream once in a while or whatever. Absolutely spoil your sister but don\u2019t exclude your other siblings.

The youngest child in the household watches an older child get a gift from someone THEY have known as a sibling all of their life - that's just unnecessarily mean and cold. Just because you were sixteen when you met that child, doesn't mean that child wasn't a toddler and doesn't see and know you as their family.

I was very little but I still vividly remember feeling a little sad and confused watching all the gifts.  He noticed it and handed me a tiny gift and I was soooo excited.  It was such a small gesture in the moment but it made a big difference and taught me a valuable lesson about never letting people feel left out if you can help it.  \n\nAs an adult, I always bring a tiny gift for any child that is not the main gift recipient.  Children Don\u2019t understand gifting rules and obligations fully and they can feel hurt if not included.  \n\nSometimes that means a small gift for an older niece or nephew to celebrate being a big sibling.

But as a child it is hard. It doesn\u2019t mean you have to get gifts for your step siblings, but you can be discrete in how you give the gifts.

The 9 year old probably doesn't remember life without you and F11 as step-siblings, so not getting her a gift is especially hurtful and confusing for her. \n\nI would start off by apologizing to M15 and F9. Say that you weren't thinking clearly, and that you do care for them. Skip the gifts next time and bring them out for ice cream, or get them each something small. Have the conversation with your sister too about why you want to do this. And realistically, you can save those bigger gifts for her birthday. \n\nIn the end, Legos are great but relationships that we build with family, even stepfamily, are the things that will persist.

One is an unfortunately normal fact of life. The other is you going out of your way to be a dick.\n\nWhy not split the difference? Bring some garlic rolls to share with everyone. Then once folks are full and distracted, slip your favorite something special. A small token turns you from villain to hero. \n\nAnd that\u2019s the thing.

The boy probably understood generally why the bio sister was treated better, bit also likely struggled with it as he was still young.  But the real kicker is the girl, she was 3 now 9, she isn't going to remember life before  OP, and she spent her younger years feeling excluded while likely being too young to really grasp why. I can absolutely see why the mom doesn't like the situation, as the clear favoritism is likely something the kids struggle with.\n\nImma say NTA, but also if it were me I'd absolutely get a little something for the other kids. It doesn't have to be a $100 lego set, it can be something smaller and cheaper, but that shows thought.\n\nEdit: I'll also say I agree with some others here.  Your bio sister is getting the attention and sisterly love, the step siblings who see you as a sister do not and this will 100% cause friction between them and your bio sister.  Bullying and resentment is possible, and while your intentions may be good, the actions could inadvertently cause strife for your younger sister in the future, for something she had no control over.

The parents may also try to compensate by treating the step-siblings, like some people are saying they should, but have you ever met a child?

And that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t feel anything for them or dislike them, but I will never, ever love them like the bond I have with my biological sister, who I grew up with and spent 24/7 with as opposed to random kids I was put with when we were preteens and teenagers for 3 evenings a week. Honestly in terms of family I\u2019d say they are like outer circle where I care about them and see them a couple of times a year, but don\u2019t really love deeply like close family.\n\nSorry but relationships just do not work like that. Just like you can\u2019t put 2 strangers in a room and go, \u2018You\u2019ll eventually love each other!\u2019 you can\u2019t force family feelings or sibling love either. Sometimes it happens, sometimes it doesn\u2019t. That\u2019s life.", "It seems to me it is much more the \"Everytime I come home\" than anything.

They're allowed to do whatever, but it's a dick move.", "OP isn't obligated to spend money on anyone? Why get his sister a gift? Why go home to visit at all?

Personally they should try and foster a better relationship, but then again we don't know the rest of the circumstances.", "And while OP may not have a connection with the step siblings, it's likely that her younger sister does (or could). I grew up in complex blended family where one side treated all the kids equally (at least when they were all present) and other sides made very clear distinctions over which kids were owed what from who. Ultimately, it messed up the relationships that most of the kids' generation formed with each other since we spent so much time being reminded that we weren't *really* family.", "yeah, but they are not the sister's kid, right, expecting 22-year-olds to not give things to sibling and deepen their relationship because other people might get jealous is stupid. It would have YTA if the girl's mother or step kids dad have done something. Elder sis doesn't owe anything. If she is need od support where they both need to give the money saved for children, how many of you will say the parents should do it because elder sis need it???", "How do you handle this situation \"well ?\" \n\n\nby matching the gifts ?  hard to do when you don't know what she's bringing,  and might not even do much since the kids will know who the gifts are from. \n\n\nwhat would you do ?", "When it comes to adults, of course. However when it comes to children, especially  younger ones, I'm really not sure this is an okay approach. No one says she should love the 9 year old with all her heart etc, but going to the other extreme, with the blatant favoritism of her bio sister, is... let's say an approach that could be improved.", "Exactly,  so OP isn't obligated to love all of them. So, if she favors her own sibling over her step siblings, she isn't wrong", "As someone else pointed out part of the problem may be that the younger sibs views OP as a sibling and already had interactions with OP as such. When OP does not. The oldest was 9 when he met and bonded with OP while OP was at home. Little kids can grow attached stupendously fast. Especially if they want/were eager for that type of dynamic. I remember being a highschool sophomore, visiting a school mates house for the first time. She had a little sister around that age. The little sister had a terse relationship with my classmate. Largely because classmate was very much a bully. By the time I left one day later, the little sister was asking if I could be her sibling instead. This kid was desperate for a older sib that spent time with her and talked to her in a positive way. Standing up to her sister and playing with her for one day was all it took for this kid to go \"New older brother \ud83e\udd7a.\"\n\nThe 15 year old may be old enough to understand that time may not have been enough for OP now that they are 15. They may be a little bummed out if they clinged to OP when he was 9.  However you start getting used to the idea that feelings can be one-sided before fifteen. Nine year old on the other hand probably isn't used to one-sided/parasocial relationships in real life. Both kids may feel a sense of personal rejection here that is valid. \n\nIt also arguably may not be entirely fair to OPs little sister. (the one OP views as her sibling.) The nine year old could start harbouring resentment to OPs sister. Possibly think she needs to compete with OPs sister for attention. These two need to get along for several years to go still. OP maybe shouldn't buy any more gifts temporarily untill the parents explain and get this sorted out with the youngest at least. Untill the nine year old has had that misconception fixed it can make life harder for the young sib via making manufactured strife.", "I am the oldest in a family with 2 siblings and 2 stepsiblings. I was 16 when my father met and married my stepmother. I never had a strong connection with the stepsibblings when i was young, but if you bring a gift for 1 child, you should still bring something small for the other children. I get OP does not consider them to be close, but the younger kids have known OP as a sister since they were 9 and 3. The only thing that makes her the AH here is not considering how the actual children would feel in this scenario and not having the sense to give the gift privately if she doesn't/is unable to get a gift for the other siblings.", "This is what's probably happens when OP comes home:\n\nStep sister: Can I play Legos?\n\nOPs little sister: OP got it for me, so i don't have to share. \n\n\nThe mom has a responsibility for the home to be tranquil, and these gifts are probably creating jealousy and animosity. I could imagine it affecting the little girl. \n\nIt also doesn't create a good environment to have one child love her sister, but her step siblings disliking her. \n\nI think sisters day is good, but not with physical things the other siblings can see.", "OP is 22 and they have been in her life for 6 years\u2026\u201dbarely any connection\u201d is doing some\npretty heavy lifting there.", "How does it affect the 15 year old? \n\nSeeing his little sister sad because his step sister is buying cool things for his step sister.\n\nHell is going to break loose when that boy gets a job and starts buying his little sister things every day, but not his step sister. \n\nIt's a slippery slope.", "OP is already spending on Lego sets for her sis. They could just (a) give in secret or (b) get a dumb thing or two for their stepsibs. It's not a big deal to include them, it supports the relationships and family dynamic, and, frankly, it's the courteous thing to do. It's fine to acknowledge they're not your full siblings and thus there's not as much love, but they're all still part of a collective family unit. Blended families are awesome but everyone has to try to participate, just like a \"normal\" family. OP is not participating.", "Sure, it\u2019s not their responsibility.

Even if not intentionally, it\u2019s not cool to go out of your way to do something to repeatedly upset people, especially kids. It creates a shitty dynamic in the home(that OP doesn\u2019t live in anymore) and they need to respect the rules that if they aren\u2019t going to get for all, they\u2019ll have to stop getting for their favourite sibling because blatant favouritism is upsetting, especially when you\u2019re not blood related and that feels like the reason(and is the reason according to OP)", "The relationship between them and her little sister they live with.

Would I gift my bio bro, who is close with them, something in front of their face and not get them anything? No. Especially not at that age. Because I'm not an ah. Regardless of my relationship with them, it would have harmed his relationship with them and encourage resenment to build and reinforce an us and them divide in the family. \n\nBlending families is hard enough. If you just want to gift your bio sibling something do it quietly away from the steps. Maybe at dad's house, assuming he's still in the picture, or when steps are with their bio mum (assuming she's still around).", "OP had absolutely no part of them becoming family, his mom got remarried not him. Mom feels bad for her new kids then maybe she should give him the cash to buy the gifts as well, he still would be under no obligations to comply. Legos ain't cheap.", "Ok but then the parents should make sure to take care of them in that way. Op didn\u2019t choose to have step siblings and is a college student who likely has a limited income. It\u2019s not their responsibility to make sure other people\u2019s kids feel good", "Because she\u2019s not their family lol.", "Because they feel zero connection due to not really being siblings?", "Even though my bonus son has been in my family since he was 4?", "I didn't mention anything about love. No one did, as far as I can see. \n\n\nEveryone will have different relationships with their siblings, some people get on better with steps than bios, but this is about respect.  And also in a way about being an adult, as OP is the only grown child. \n\nMaybe it's a maturity thing but none of the kids asked to be lumped together, your steps are in the exact same damn boat as you- except OP as an adult can leave and live her own life.  There's just no need to make the steps feel like shit, they are kids and as far as the post tells they did nothing wrong.", "Or the step-siblings can just deal with not getting gifts from their not-sibling", "No, I only have seen the steps for an hour, bio I see often.", "When did i say \"Anyone\" ???\n\nI said \"Someone she doesn't consider family\" why are you trying to make stuffs up??\n\nAgain OP isn't Obligated to Finance those Children, if the parents have a Problem with that they can Give money to OP to get Gifts for the step Children.", "Because OP is an adult and the 9 year old is a child. Adults sometimes need to not do what they want all the time for the benefit/protection of young children who don\u2019t know better. It\u2019s a well known fact of life.", "I fully agree, I think a better way to do it would be to organise special days that she spends alone with her sister and then also has days where she brings gifts for all her siblings. Even if her mom threw her a bit of money to cover the gifts for the step siblings just to keep the peace.", "But the problem is that OPs gift giving is not neutral toward the siblings, but it is an actively negative action because it creates an environment of inequity. This whole \u201celder sister doesn\u2019t owe anything\u201d argument presumes that the gifts don\u2019t have a negative affect in the others - but it does. And we don\u2019t know how those kids see OP. The youngest has been in OPs life since they were 3 so they very likely see OP as a sister. I\u2019m sorry but you\u2019re just not seeing the bigger picture.", "I'd talk to kids about how everyone doesn't get the exact same thing from everyone.  In this case she has a different relationship with your step sister than you and so chooses to give a gift to her and not you.", "But she IS her BIO sister opposed to her mothers husbands children.", "If the gifts stop though, for no other reason than \u2018your sister is jealous of this\u2019 then it\u2019s just as likely to harbour resentment the other way round between the stepsisters though. It just needs to be pointed out to the step sibs that look they have X gift from granny and Y gift from their mum that oldest sis didn\u2019t get. They may have extra aunts and uncles\u2026 Even their friends will get them different gifts for their birthday parties. And that as parents they will treat them the same but they ultimately do come from different families on their other sides and that does mean there will sometimes be a difference in how they\u2019re treated and the gifts they\u2019re given. And sometimes that\u2019s not going to feel fair and it\u2019s ok to feel disappointed but it\u2019s not ok to behave badly or take that out on anyone. It doesn\u2019t sound like the sis is buying gifts that are ridiculously overblown or expensive (although there\u2019s a big range with Lego) or to an inappropriate level. Like if she had gone out and bought her an IPhone 14 pro and a Gucci handbag this would be a different conversation.\n\nEdit: and part of that conversation by the parents should be to reinforce that OP is NOT their full sibling. Rather than trying to force OP to pretend their relationship is something it\u2019s not which the kids will pick up on, surely it\u2019s better to acknowledge that this is a step sibling relationship but that doesn\u2019t mean that OP can\u2019t be an awesome big stepsister. And that might look different from being an awesome sister but they could talk about what the step sibs would like from their stepsister relationship - not in comparison to what full sis has but what would seem like a nice thing to them. Eg OP taking them out for a parent free McDonald\u2019s trip or something, which the parents could possibly pay for to help facilitate the relationship between the 4 of them, or OP replying to the stepsibs texts when she can to give them older sibling advice. Or OP could try and foster a bit more of a 1-1 relationship with each of them like going to pick one of them up from an activity if she\u2019s home for an extended break and they chat on the car ride home. Just little things to show that OP doesn\u2019t hate them or not have any interest in them at all and can be a cool sisterfriend in a way that\u2019s different to the relationship between the two blood sisters but still a nice bonus relationship in their lives. She could also start bringing a small inexpensive gift for each, which I think would be a nice touch, especially if she could think about something that wasn\u2019t expensive but was still something that appealed to each kids interests. So the sister gets the bigger better gift but the steps get something to show that it\u2019s not that she doesn\u2019t care about them at all.", "There's nothing in the post that implies that they have seen her as a sister for 6 years, just that that was the time when they met. I have step siblings too and know well that the transition took years after they moved in (which they didn't move in for some time either). The kids arent young anymore, one of them is well into their teen years, they don't need a gift from OP, whos busy with their own responsibilities, they need their parents to teach  them that the world isnt fair. if a 15 year old gets upset now that an 11 year old gets toys from a relative, imagine how entitled they'll grow up to be in a few years", "Well she\u2019s been moved out for 3 of those years.

Some perspective as people fail to realize how awful living by the decisions of others can be.", "OP has no responsibility to participate, period.", "what, so OP should just be forced to participate in a family they never signed up for? It's not her responsibility, as a busy working adult, to give gifts to other ppls kids. the fact that the parents are blaming OP instead of using this as a teaching opportunity about entitlement and that the world isnt fair speaks volumes, especially when a 15 year old is still getting upset over it at their age.", "But that's not OP's responsibility, that's on the parents.  If the parents are letting little sister be bullied because of this, then they are terrible parents likely letting other issues occur.", "What makes you think OP did it right in their face? OP could've given it to her sister in her room and maybe the kids asked the sister later where she got the legos.", "That would be one work around. There are lots of ways to handle this without it being an all or nothing situation.", "You can give gifts in private and not have other kids feel left out or less loved. They are too young to be l logical about it.  It doesn't matter who owns the kids. It's about how the actions make the kids feel regardless of who owns what.

It's a dick move.", "He lived there for 3 years with them", "As someone else pointed out, it's simple politeness. Even if it's not family, if you bring a gift for one kid (not counting birthdays, graduation, ect), you bring something for everyone. Or, at very least, you give the single gift privately. OP isn't nessicaraly a full on AH, but definitely lacking in manners.", "Yes, imo even then. Again, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s damaging or offensive to teach your child that he may have more distant family from your spouse or partner\u2019s side of the family than from his own biological family. That\u2019s just how life is sometimes and it\u2019s ok to know that from a young age.\n\nIt\u2019s worth considering that when he grows older HE might not consider THEM his actual or \u2018bonus grandparents\u2019 and always see them as more distant step-family with more of a barrier there. And again, that\u2019s ok too.\n\nSometimes you just don\u2019t feel that way about extended family. My stepsiblings and stepgrandparents are not comparable to my biological family and that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like them but I didn\u2019t choose them, my dad did, and they just aren\u2019t close family to me and never will be.\n\nPeople love to be like \u2018they\u2019re just the same as my REALLL FAMILY\u2019 about extended families, as if it\u2019s all a Kodak moment because you shove people YOU chose together. I actually think it\u2019s very selfish for anyone to choose their own family but then push your choice onto others and expect them to have feelings of love and devotion.\n\nSometimes it just doesn\u2019t happen. And if you can choose your own family so can other people, and that includes the choice to NOT see them as their own.", "Is there a reason why you give the bio kid their present in front of the step kids?", "I never said you did say \"Anyone\". OP isn't obligated to finance those children but she is obligated to not create a hostile environment in the house and that is obviously what is happening if OPs mom is upset about it.", "That would be ideal. I like it!", "which will still drive a wedge in the relationship between 9-11 year olds.", "It's still the polite thing to do. If you get one child a proper gift, at least do the decent thing and bring them a share box of cakes or sweets from the local bakery or equivalent that they can enjoy as well. It might not have the same monetary value, but even showing that you're thinking of someone in the vaguest sense means a lot to people and is very little effort for anyone not self-absorbed.", "Yes there is?? The mom literally approached OP and said it\u2019s upsetting the other children. Not to mention if you\u2019ve been a kids sibling since they were 3 and they are 9 now, then you can be pretty sure that kid views you as a sibling. It would be an outlier for the youngest to not view them as a sibling, the normal would be viewing them as a sibling", "OP says \u201cevery time i come home from college.\u201dSounds like shes away at college and comes home on breaks/summers.

Expecting this girl to buy gifts for kids she clearly feels no family connection to is a shitty thing to do. And her mum is the AH for trying to force a connection with a family SHE chose. Her daughter didn't choose it.", "I guess you missed the part about me living in a blended house full of kids I wasn't related to.", "The parents need to teach their kids that life ain't fair. Also, giving the gift in private won't matter if the kids find out anyway. You think a 9 and 15 yo can't see that a new toy or whatever is there? That they didn't see it before op got there and wouldn't put the pieces together? Op doesn't owe thier step siblings anything.", "Serious question: do you think gifts should be given to all children on someone\u2019s birthday?", "If I want to give my sister a gift I should be able to do so without being pressured to spend money I don't have.", "You don\u2019t live in the real world lol. People treat others differently based on personal connections all the time. There are far worse things for kids than learning that at a young age.\n\nGiving gifts in private would not make much difference when the kids live together.", "She's extended family not direct family", "Then the parents should plan for that, not the kid. OP is not responsible for moms step kids period. It might not be fair but it\u2019s true", "step siblings living in the same roof are direct family to me."]}
