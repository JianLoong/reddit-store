That is embarrassing", "YTA\n\nYour stepsiblings are still your siblings. You're like saying you wouldn't treat an adopted child as your own family just because you're not biologically related. Also your step siblings are quite young, ofc they will feel hurt and unwelcomed when an a wholeass adult will discriminate them.", "YTA, because your behavior of giving extra attention will eventually lead to the step kids finding retaliation against your sister and damaging their relationship. It\u2019s ok to not want to buy the others gifts, but think about the effects being the favorite will have on your younger sister.", "YTA. Everyone saying NTA clearly don\u2019t have sympathy or empathy towards kids. \u201cYeah, you love your step sister but she doesn\u2019t see yous as actual siblings or loves you as much as her REAL sibling, that\u2019s why she doesn\u2019t give you gifts\u201d\n\nHow fucking disgusting do you have to be to even think that is right? In any capacity?", "I have a srep-family who have been in my life for 32 years. I do not consider them my family nor do they consider me family. This is my mother's husband's family, not mine. I think people try way too hard to force step-parents and their families onto their children. It's okay to have a cordial relationship with someone who your parent made the choice to force into your life, but you are not required to consider them family. This is where true resentment and dislike for a step- family occurs, forced relationships. \nNTA", "INFO: Did the step siblings ever give you gifts? Or since they're younger, did they at least wish you well on your special occasions like birthdays?", "It's a complicated situation. On one hand, you're not accountable for your step-siblings, but on the other hand, it deeply upsets them when you clearly show favoritism towards your sister solely because she's your biological relative. Just imagine being a 9-year-old and witnessing someone you consider part of your family receiving more love and attention than you due to blood ties. This dynamic can disrupt the sibling relationship and significantly damage their self-esteem at such a young age. I wouldn't go as far as to label you an AH, but perhaps you could make an effort to at least spend some money on a gift for your younger step-sister. After all, she's your little sister and these gestures can have a profound impact on her well-being.", "YTA overall\n\nI don't think it's right to show clear favouritism. These kids are young still, they might feel insecure because of the way you treat one over others.\n\nWould it be possible  to get a little something each for your stepsiblings too? It doesnt have to be grand, just something to make them feel included. As a stepchild myself it really really makes the difference. I feel a lot less alienated this way, and i'm grateful.\n\nHowever, your sister is clearly very important to you. It's great you have a bond with her!! You're free to treat her as much as you like (obviously)!! Your bond with her is super nice :)\n\nNTA for treating your sister, but YTA for completely excluding your stepsiblings. It hurts. And, hurting two people weighs more than spoiling one.\n\n(Also, if you've known them for 6 whole years, that's even worse. They feel unwanted by you. It's not nice.)\n\nediting:\n\na lot of the comments say you shouldnt feel inclined to give anything to the stepchildren. While I agree that you don't have to and they arent really related to you, it would just be a nice thing to do considering you're making a large effort to spoil your actual sister. It doesnt take much.\n\nIf you can't give anything to the stepsiblings (i get that you might not have unlimited funds which is absolutely ok) you could easily give it to your sister in private. Or, if you're feeling kind, allow them to share.\n\nYou dont have to see them as siblings either \\[which i think is a really key point\\] . You can just see them as the children of your mothers husband (or whatever is happening). But, you don't have to exclude them", "NTA. You don\u2019t need to get gifts for your mom\u2019s chosen family members. That\u2019s her job. You are 22yo and have expenses. Kudos for prioritizing your sister.", "NTA. You decide whom you want to bring a gift. It is your money and you spend it as you see fit.\n\nYou didn't choose for your stepsiblings to be a part of your life. Your mother can't expect you to love/like them equally to your bio sister. Stepsibling relationships should never be forced by the parents. That can't result in a healthy relationship. You lived with your stepsiblings for three years when you were 15. That is normally not an age where children would develop sibling like love for \"strange\" kids. I think it is totally normal that you treat your bio sister different, as long as you're not mean etc to your stepsiblings.", "YTA, not because you owe these kids anything, but because you're fostering a nasty environment in a house you no longer even live in by being an ass about this.  Stop it.", "NTA\nYou only have known them since you were 16 and you moved out when you were 19. 3 years vs 8 is a big difference.\n\nMaybe bring them some small gifts to keep the peace but you have no obligation. You're allowed to show favoritism, as long as you're not just spoiling her with ridiculous things which Legos are not. You're the older sister, not the parent which a lot of these Y-T-As think is the same as adopting your step siblings apparently.", "INFO: how long have they been your step siblings? This matters for the judgement, as the longer you have known them, the more asshole-ish this makes you.", "I think he is feeding and creating resentments between the brothers. They are children and because they are children they will clearly understand that you don't like them, but your sister. What will happen is that in the future you will be remembered by them as the person who came to the house, bringing gifts for the other and not for all of them. Don't expect to have any kind of relationship in the future with your step brothers if you keep this up.", "NTA. You don't have to buy anything for anyone you don't want to. But maybe make sure to give her gifts in private.", "How long have they been your siblings? \n\nHow long ago did you leave for college?\n\nIf they are reletivly new as siblings and you did not have a lot of interaction with them before you left home, it is understandable why you favor your sister, as you know her more and have an established relationship with her.", "INFO: How long have they been your step siblings? If for example you grew up with your step-brother from the age of 12 (random example) then yeah, YTA, but if you were already an adult and your Mother pursued a new relationship, it's not like you've ever seen them as family regardless of what your Mother wants.", "**Info: How does your step family/dad treat you and your biological sister?**\n\nYou\u2019ve known your step-sibling since she was 3. \n\nSo It does seem a little uncaring to purposely gift your biological sister presents in front of a 9 year old (who probably also sees you as their big sister\u2026?) \n\nFrom what you\u2019ve written it sounds like you\u2019re trying to make a point?", "YTmegaA", "mmm I'm not gonna pass judgement because yeah technically you have no responsibility to the other kids but your youngest step sibling was 3 when you came into their life and have lived the majority of their life with you being a decent part of it. She probably doesn't conceptualise why she's less special to you and I can empathize with her/your mum's point. Your mum's also probably not trying to stop you from having a good relationship with your sister but doesn't want resentment between your sister and step siblings because you've in a certain way made your sister the golden child.", "NTA. You aren't a parent. You are allowed to show favoritism.", "You don't ask for gifts, you receive gifts. NTA", "Low key YTA, but not for caring more about your little sister,  more for not thinking about how uncomfortable this might leave her feeling when you are not there.\n\nShe has no choice but to live in this blended family for now, and whilst the parents will be trying to treat everyone equally and to build a single unit you keep popping back and hammering a wedge back into the gaps.", "NTA.  You don't have a relationship with them like you do with your sister.  Your mom needs to explain to them why they are not getting a present instead of trying to strong arm you into buying them a gift.", "NTA\n\nNot your blood, not your problem.", "NTA there is an argument about the highroad and this and that, but you aren't doing anything you shouldn't.  I don't understand the whole step siblings become your siblings, I would too clearly favor my biological sibling.  You are doing the same thing most people would do I would think, you have no obligation to the stepkids.", "NTA not your siblings. It's their parents job to explain it to them.", "NTA.

They're just being entitled because they want free gifts, not because they care about being your sibling lol. Your mom just doesn't want to deal with your whining.

If you are giving gifts to the point that the other kids know that they are being left out then you are being cruel. Step siblings are siblings.

She doesn't have a relationship with her mother's step children.
