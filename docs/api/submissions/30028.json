They all think I\u2019m the reason they can\u2019t get back together even though she\u2019s the one who cheated and I didn\u2019t meet him until he was in the middle of their divorce negotiations. His kids are rude to me and when I was pregnant with our first child, they told me I should hurry and get an abortion before it\u2019s too late.\n\nAnyway, during the divorce negotiations, my husband voluntarily gave up the paid off house so that his kids wouldn\u2019t have to move schools. He agreed to pay child support beyond what the courts would have imposed and his alimony amount is more than her salary. In return, she agreed to not sale the house or move until the youngest is 18. \n\nSomething happened and she sold the house and moved into an apartment. This past weekend, he came and asked if I would object to him buying her another house because she\u2019s missing out on her time with the kids. They refuse to stay in her cramped apartment. I said no and that she needs to live with the consequences from her bad decisions. He begged but I stood my ground. I reminded him that we have a child together and another on the way. Any money he spends on his ex is taking away from their future. He argued that his kids need a home and I countered that they each have their own rooms in our house. Even though I can\u2019t stand them, I can be an adult and tolerate them if it means he doesn\u2019t buy his ex a house. He said it\u2019ll be in our names but I countered that interest rates are high and the housing market in our area is crashing so we\u2019ll lose money if we buy a house now which in turn will affect our children\u2019s future.\n\nHis ex reached out to his parents and now they\u2019re on my case about making their grand kids homeless. It feels like everyone is making me out to be the wicked stepmother and I\u2019m the crazy one. I can\u2019t be the only one to think it\u2019s crazy for a husband to buy his ex a house.\n\nUpdate\n\nGood morning. I saw several common questions so I\u2019ll answer them here.\n\n1. No one is sure why she had to sell the house. My husband and her argued for weeks after it was already done. I\u2019ve heard several reasons but I didn\u2019t include them because I don\u2019t know which is the accurate one. All we know for sure is that she doesn\u2019t have much left after the sale.\n\n2. The house was fully paid off with no liens. He transferred full ownership to her so she was solely responsible for the taxes and maintenance.\n\n3. His kids have been living with us for a month and we\u2019ve settled into a silent routine. I don\u2019t try to mother them and they ignore me. We provide them with the same food we eat and whatever else they need. My husband parents them.\n\n4. The low end price of a house in our area and within their schools is about $300,000 right now. I can deal with the situation until they\u2019re all 18 and out of the house if it means we\u2019re not spending at least $300,000.\n\n5. My husband and I make about the same. We have our joint account and separate accounts. If he does buy her another house, it will only be with his money so it won\u2019t affect my financially. However, what if he loses his job soon afterwards, have an accident where he can no longer work, or any of the other reasons I don\u2019t want to happen but have to plan for our children.\n\n6. They had an agreement and she broke it but there\u2019s nothing my husband can really do about it at this point. He can\u2019t sue for full custody because the kids are already living full time with us. He\u2019s not paying child support since they are and she\u2019s not arguing about that. He can\u2019t sue her for the house or money she doesn\u2019t have.", "created_utc": 1698752273, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17kiyp0/aita_for_not_letting_my_husband_buy_a_house_for/", "score": 89, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also, your step kids are not homeless, they have 2 houses, they just dont like either one of them. \n\nYou need to focus on yourself and your kids. Your husband needs some common sense.

Why do you leave a house that is paid for to rent an apartment. Nope - something fishy here", " Info? \u2018Something happened\u2019 is doing a lot of heavy lifting here.

He gave her a fully paid off house, paid over the odds for child support and alimony, and now wants to buy her *another* house?\n\nShe either has something over him, or he still loves her. Either way, your marriage isn't safe. As you say, his children have a home with you and they're *choosing* not to stay with her. They aren't in danger, so why is he prepared to risk your financial future to help a woman who cheated on him?\n\nYou need to sit down and have a very serious conversation with him about this. He needs to make a choice between his wives. He can't have both. He either starts behaving as though his ex is actually his ex, or you should start looking for a divorce lawyer.", "NTA.  She broke her agreement,  it's her problem.", "Also how did she sell a house that was in his name- surely he didn\u2019t take his name off of the title?

If his parents feel strongly about it, let them buy her another house.", "NTA. I\u2019m assuming she had to sell the house means she mortgaged the house and lost it to foreclosure (or had to short sale it to stop a foreclosure), lost it because she failed to pay property taxes, or was sued and lost the house in a judgement.", "NTA. That is definitely the hill I would die on. He was paying alimony, child support and left her the house. Does she have a gambling issue perhaps? If she doesn't have the money after selling the house, that's not your problem or your husband' s problems. That's a HER problem. She needs to get her life straight, not you. After your second baby I would rethink if you want to have more kids with this guy, seems like he needs to grow a backbone and say no to his ex.", "NTA.\n\nHe divorced and settled with his ex-wife.  She had a paid-off house, child support, alimony, and a job.  If she had to sell the house and had very little left over, then she had a gambling problem or got scammed or something--that is not your problem or your husband's problem.\n\nThe people saying \"it's his money\" are wrong. You two are partners, and whatever financial decisions you make separately also affect each other.  In effect it sounds like he wants to buy a house and let her use it rent-free. That is a bad investment.", "NTA he already bought her a house. She sold it and moved to an apartment that\u2019s on her. Separate your finances now get your money away from him being able to use it on his ex. I think you might be in for a divorce yourself. He sounds more worried about his ex than you.", "YTA for marrying a guy with kids who you hate", "NTA but neither is he for caring about his kids enough to consider it. It\u2019s not his responsibility to save her from her poor luck or decisions. There might be some middle ground in which they go back to court and renegotiate the finances so that if he bought or rented her a place, his alimony and child support would be reduced to a point that he\u2019s paying the same amount per month.", "NTA for the situation, but \u201cI can deal with the situation until they\u2019re all 18\u201d is an AH move for sure. Anyone who marries someone who already has kids, needs to know that those are their partners kids and will likely always have a relationship with them. They don\u2019t disappear at 18.
