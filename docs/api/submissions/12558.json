He was and she began using drugs (pot to start, then pills, and later heroin). She managed to graduate high school but had no plans after. During this time her drug use got worse.

She\u2019s his baby and he\u2019s always been a softy with her.\n\nCurrent situation: she reached back out to us, we paid for rehab, and she is about to finish 60 inpatient rehab. She\u2019s wants to move in with us (not sure why she doesn\u2019t want to go to her mom\u2019s). I don\u2019t want this.

Let the experts at rehab tell your husband what your daughter\u2019s best next steps are. If they can\u2019t speak about his daughter specifically, ask them to speak generally.\n\n\nAs for your rules - those will be easier for her to swallow after transitional housing. \n\nI do think that locking her out of the main house at night is a bit much.", "NTA and I agree strongly about transitional housing. I would actully be a bit wary of her being able to come and go from the basement with no accountability, though.\n\nIt sounds like she probably burned a lot of those couch surfing bridges while she was using, that's why she's reaching out. You aren't wrong to be skeptical.", "NTA. You have very generous rules. I would add must get a job, submit to random drug tests, and must pay rent.", "NTA. You\u2019re essentially giving her an apartment, rent free, on the basis she gets treatment. And then treating her like a tenant with her own space. I think this is reasonable, given there is an opportunity to revisit requirements after a certain time. Best of luck to her, it\u2019s a road with ups and downs but hopefully all trends upward for her.", "NTA - but it sounds like your husband doesn\u2019t buy into the rules.  Rules without consequences are just suggestions that can be ignored.  What happens when she stops following the rules??  Without agreed upon consequences, it\u2019s going to turn into a war in Your house.\n\nIs there a drug counselor that you and your husband can talk to?  Is there a plan for a meeting of you, your husband, and his daughter with counselors at the rehab facility before she is ready to be checked out??\n\nIt sounds like your step daughter is unlikely to follow the rules which means that she really doesn\u2019t get the depth of her problem, which means that she is likely to relapse soon after moving back in, and then what??.\n\nThe 60 day rehab only addresses the physical withdrawal of the drugs.  It\u2019s not long enough to establish all the mental tools and lifestyle changes that she needs to make to be successful in staying clean once she is out.\n\nYou see the train approaching a bridge out.  Your husband and his daughter seem to think everything is going to be fine and over once she is out.  This is the real problem\u2026. And if your Husband isn\u2019t willing to monitor and discipline, the train is going off the tracks and into the valley the hard way\u2026", "NTA. For some people, rehab is a wake up call. For others, they choose to live the cycle their whole life.\n\nYour husband's job is to push her onto the right path, and he will continue to do this for the rest of his life unless he finally has enough of the cycle. Your job is to be supportive of the choice he makes as long as he is respecting your boundaries... Otherwise you have a different problem to deal with... He doesn't choose a partner over his child.\n\nYour idea of giving her the basement apartment is the best solution for the first round of rehab recovery, for now. This is what your husband wants and you can monitor a little bit of what she is doing. In order to protect yourselves, you guys should have her sign a lease and request payment. No matter how small the rent is.... Unfortunately, you may have to evict her so the paperwork is important. Plus this is part of life... Even if she didn't live with you she'd sign a lease somewhere else... Your husband can use the rent to put in a secret savings account for her, which may be the way to get him to agree to this.\n\nKeep your home lock and the apartment's locks separate. Do not co-mingle keys and set this as a hard first boundary for your husband. She's only to visit in the same way she would if she wasn't in rehabilitation (you're there and she's invited). You don't give keys to people you can't trust.. this is completely normal. I highly recommend getting a safe to put your valuables in. Especially important banking information, SSN, credit cards, etc.\n\nYou and your husband are going to have to compromise a lot... I highly suggest counseling because this is going to be a rollercoaster. You have no idea if she will turn her life around anytime soon. Wether it's couples or just individual counseling... Highly recommend. You've been married since she was 15 and around 17/18 her HS drama started... Hopefully the recovery goes smoothly. Keep her out of trouble. Good luck! \n\nEncourage her to get a time intensive hobby. Something that keeps her out of a bad crowd. A dog who needs walking, video games, so many choices. A problem will arise if she gets bored and has too much time to get into trouble.", "I think most of those rules are reasonable except for the having a curfew one and the sharing location.  Those aren't reasonable at all and are way over the line into controlling.\n\nYou're mostly NTA,  but she's still entitled to freedom in the way other adults are - you cannot give an adult a curfew.", "Get a lock box for your belongings just incase anyways. I wouldn't trust that girl as far as I could throw her. Or electronic safe of sorts and your hubby can't have access either", "NTA, mostly. She IS a criminal. I\u2019d add that her boyfriend or ex-boyfriend is never allowed on the property, nor any other active drug users of any kind. \n\nWhere I think you are tending towards AH is that you pretty clearly are feeling a lot of unhappiness resolved anger and disdain for her that you haven\u2019t processed. She did a stupid thing and has caused harm to herself and to you, but she was and is very young. Don\u2019t give up on her yet, though I agree she is likely to go backwards this time if she isn\u2019t taking responsibility for her behavior. I think you would do well to pursue therapy to process these feelings even if she doesn\u2019t move back in. It\u2019s likely to be a longer road.", "NTA. Curfew might be a bit much. Reigning her in too much might make her run and your husband deserves some sort of a shot to help his daughter. The basement sounds basically like an apartment, so the no going upstairs isn't excessive if you think of it that way. Spring for a mini fridge and a microwave, and she'll be more then set.", "NTA. You should push for transitional housing or your husband helping her with an apartment. Coming back home should be the last resort.", "NTA, it's your home and you're allowed to put rules in place to make yourself comfortable.

NTA", "NTA. I don\u2019t blame you for wanting to hold her accountable and taking precautions. However some of the rules are a little harsh. I think you should have her counselor review these rules to make sure they\u2019re mutually beneficial.

My parents have locks on most of the bedrooms plus the garage freezer and fridge to keep my sister out of all those places. She'll wander around at night and things will disappear otherwise.\n\nI do think your SD should go to transitional housing though, and I'm sure the rehab staff would also say that.

And ya know what, I needed that. The admission of thefts and other transgressions didn't happen right away, I was still trying to process this huge upheaval in my life. Within a month or so they did get my truthful admissions and apologizes. If she wants to move back, she has to follow the rules of your home. If she doesn't want that, then she can go into a supported living situation. And I just to also say, that after 15 years I'm still not recovered. It's a life long process, you maintain your recovery.

If your husband is arguing with you about it though maybe think of compromises. The only reason i mentioned this is because you said that he is soft hearted and that is his baby. If he wants her to have access to the house he needs to install indoor security cameras? Get a lock for your bedroom door so she can't ever be in there. \n\nThe point is he has to make you feel secure somehow and if he can't think of ways himself to protect you then she needs to live somewhere else. \n\nEverything I think you said is reasonable and try to stick to it as much as possible.

My suggestion would be for you and your husband to go to Al-Anon.  Your rules for your step daughter will only work to drive you crazy. She can go to an Oxford house, and if she's pissed at you she can tell her sponsor\n\nEdited to add: I can guarantee you her treatment center is telling her NOT to go live with you.  They are telling her to go to Oxford house or a long term.  If your step daughter says otherwise, she's lying.  Have her sign an ROI so the treatment center staff can tell you what their recommendation is for her after care.  It's NEVER \"go home and live with your parents\".

My brother in law was like this.  It was always \u201cI was clean for x days so you should trust me again\u201d.  And trust is earned.  The good days have to start to outnumber the bad.  And whenever they rushed to get him back homer guess what.  He stole and relapsed.  And relapses have to be expected because they happen. \n\nThis is guilt tripping.  They have to sit down and listen to all the wrongs they did and make amends, not demands.", "NTA. And as others have said, transitional housing may not be a bad idea at the start. But if not, those rules would be very similar to what she would have in transitional housing.\n\nWhat your SD doesn't realize, and a lot of people will not realize if they haven't been through it themselves on one side or the other, is that it's \"easy\" to stay clean in rehab. When you have no access to drugs, none of the friends you used drugs with, and none of the situations that started or continued drug use.\n\nBut as soon as your home, all of the stresses of life come back. All of your friends come back around. And you know that your drug of choice is just 1 phonecall away. And that's when the real difficulty starts, and why so many people relapse after the 1st, 2nd, 3rd etc trip to rehab.\n\nThe way back home should be open available at some point.

If you were renting the basement apartment to a tenant, you wouldn't give them any access to the main house.  She can come and go as she pleases through the door to the yard.\n\nYour rules are nowhere near as restrictive as the ones she would encounter in a transitional living situation.  The fact that she is already complaining about them suggests she may need more time in rehab because she still doesn't understand that she has to earn back the trust she destroyed.\n\nPoint out to your husband that you are not locking her in the basement.  I'm sure she is more than capable of opening the door and walking out into the yard whenever she wants to.\n\nMy brother is a recovering alcoholic.  Rules are key and they have to be respected.

You don't know obviously it's just the beginning but she may stay clean and get her life in order but you've already written her off and banished her to the basement.

She needs to be monitored for at least 6to12 months and it's still no guarantee. My daughter will stay clean for a year but then go back. It's heat breaking to see how hard she works when sober only to lose it all when falls back. She is in a psychiatric hospital as we speak. I have no clue as to how to help her.

You don\u2019t want to isolate her into the basement because it could very well push her back into before.

Her fight against these conditions is either her feeling like she doesn't need to apologize for them and feeling entitled to forgiveness because she went to rehab (bad) or it's because she wants to just let it all go and forget it happened because she hates who she was and what she did while using drugs (understandable, but not how it works).\n\nYour husband is going to have a hard time with this because he went through what you did, but that is his baby girl.

The difference being whether she is an active addict or an addict in recovery. Sustained recovery is a lifelong process; the work will never end.

I have been your step daughter. Ive made a lot of mistakes. Drugs, selfish/destructive behavior. There was a time when all of my close family (RIGHTFULLY) didn\u2019t trust me at all. That hurt (obviously), but the older I get the more I understand why that was the case. As kids we sort of view our parents as caregivers and the curators of *our* lives, not as humans with wants and needs and complexity just like us. Doubly so if we\u2019re struggling. \n\nI would not have been able to pull my life together if my grandma hadn\u2019t stepped in and taken a chance on me. My parents, my siblings, my aunt, my uncle ALL said it was a bad idea, that she was enabling me. They were right to be cautious. She was strict with me, but most importantly\u2026 she was kind. \n\nHurt people hurt people. At that time of my life I was in a lot of pain. The people that I was around, the ones I partied with, everyone I knew\u2026 they were all miserable. Nobody opts out of life like that without having something to run from. When you don\u2019t feel worthy of goodness, you stop trying to be good. You internalize the hurt and the shame and the pain. Part of the reason it\u2019s tough to break out of that cycle is actually the cycle itself, the longer you\u2019re in it, the more evidence you have that you\u2019re not a good person so why change? \n\nMy grandmother took me in, she set hard rules, but the single element that changed for me was she didn\u2019t doubt for a moment that I could rise to the challenge. After everything I\u2019d done, she didn\u2019t doubt me. I wouldn\u2019t say she *trusted* me per se\u2026 that came later (and was very much earned), but my recovery and later successfully was not a pipe dream to her but an *inevitability*. \n\nTone is important. If you go into this wanting to punish her for all the things she\u2019s done in the pass she is going to fail because you are setting the expectation that she will. I don\u2019t see anything in your list that strikes me as MASSIVELY unfair (the locked door thing seems like a little much, but I can\u2019t deny the logic is sound). \n\nI would suggest talking to her about why you think these rules are necessary for everyone involved. She needs a soft place to land right now, and structure is the best thing for people who have been living the way she\u2019s been living. Rules and expectations provide that. They protect you from hurt feelings and feeling alienated in your own home, remind her that you\u2019re a person with just as many fears and neurosis as she does. History shows that the fears you have are not irrational. Finally, let her know that you value your relationship with her father. You both love him, and this structure will allow your relationship with him to continue strong. \n\nShe needs family right now. Get to know her, her mistakes, her messiness. Help her get to know who she\u2019d like to be. Trust is earned, absolutely, but love is unconditional. I can understand if you don\u2019t feel that for her right now, but I assume you feel it for your spouse and the best way to support him is to support her.

Pointless to demand it. If she does, it won't  be genuine. It won't satisfy you and it will make her resent you even more. Its counter productive.

The location sharing would just make her feel even more monitored and watched whilst she tries to find a new equilibrium. You want it so you can ask her why she is here and what she was doing there. You're going to be constantly checking where she is, and if you don't think she has good enough reason, there are going to be problems.\n\nYou're not locking her in the basement. You're not treating her like a criminal. You're providing her somewhere safe to live whilst she continues her recovery, and as a family, you rebuild trust, which takes work from all of you.

Only tell him this if you believe he won't turn around and tell her \"youve only got to do it for 3 months, and then you can move in.\" Also tell him - it's violating when someone goes through your things and takes them.

It\u2019s just down the road, totally available, all you have to do is call up a \u201cfriend\u201d. You already know who to contact, where to go, and what is a believable excuse as to what you were doing when your parents ask.  \n\nI\u2019ve never dealt with transitional housing. But another comment had, what I think, might be a good idea. Contact a couple of the ones your looking at. Find out their guidelines and rules. If they have rules similar to yours, then you know you\u2019re not over reacting.  Obviously you will have additional ones due to living in the home with her. But at least you can have something to show your husband - so he can realize these are normal recommendations from professionals for people fresh of recovery - not just you holding a grudge about your ring.  60 days clean is a good start, she\u2019s past the point of withdrawal symptoms. But now she has to unlearn the habit part of it, and figure out how to deal with daily life without a crutch.  It\u2019s easier to stay clean when you\u2019re in the bubble of rehab.", "You\u2019re forgetting that this is a recovering attic. If she was in a transitional home there would definitely be a curfew. You can\u2019t heal from addiction if you don\u2019t have strict boundaries that you follow", "Thank you. I just wanted to express that she had to want to stay clean. As bad as we want it for them, it's not up to us. It's their journey.", "I think that it\u2019s amusing she\u2019s like \u201cyou\u2019re treating me like a criminal\u201d when it\u2019s literally something you can get arrested for which makes her a criminal especially because she was using whatever she could steal to get heroin", "Or hovering over you while you sleep", "You need more up votes", "I know he is conscious of that does not want to enable her. I\u2019m not sure he\u2019ll be able to stick to though or even realize in the moment if he is enabling her", "No, she has a history of stealing things. You shouldn't have to be conscious of whether you left potential valuables when you went to bed. Do they have any gaming consoles or games that they want to keep in the living room? Do they have a high end set of pans in the kitchen? Is there any artwork on the walls? Do they have any tools in the garage? Do they have German style board games in the living room? All of these could easily go missing in the night and have lots of buyers on Facebook marketplace.", "We already have and have had for a while a ring camera covering our backyard. I\u2019m not even sure if she\u2019s aware of it. I\u2019ve agreed to backdown on the tracking but think we should go back to having a shared family google calendar like we did when they were in high school", "Yes that would be the plan; however, we wouldn\u2019t let her know that until we return the money after her being sober for a few years", "This!", "ur cracked if thats ur mindset esp since 99% of parents would just ditch their deadbeat druggie daughter at this stage rather than offering them free therapy + housing. OP is very accommodating towards a girl that isnt even hers + stolen her prized possessions", "But she\u2019s still in recovery. She needs to not be out late at night while she\u2019s recovering from this addiction.", "It\u2019s much less scary to think of it as a group of people who have battled the same demons and are at the same stages in healing. There is community with people looking out for each other and shared learnings. Going back to her old life with out strong tools and learnings can lead to relapse pretty quickly.", "Perhaps a safety deposit box that way there is no way she would have access to the jewelry. Keep the stuff you wear regularly in a safe or something. Try not to keep cash in the house either unless it's in the safe. Preferably a safe that's bolted into the ground. \n\nI hope she is willing to quit drugs. But it never hurts to just keep valuables out of reach. I'd also drug test her on a semi-regular basis.", "It's about more than jewelry.  Money, electronics, prescription medications, any type of collection, sports equipment, vehicles, and anything else that's not nailed down can be very attractive to someone who would happily sell other people's stuff in order to get high.  My well-intentioned family members were robbed blind by their son who \"recovered\" more times than I can count.", "Can\u2019t recommend all-anon enough for you all.", "He needs to know in no uncertain terms; interfering w her sobriety, no matter how lovingly done, is actively killing her. She\u2019s not just his daughter, she\u2019s also a person in recovery. This is a treacherous time for her. It\u2019s not about anything but helping her stay sober.", "Instead of a basement lock install cameras in the house.", "Please encourage your husband to go to Al Anon. His enabling will hurt her recovery.", "Using it towards the deposit, first month's rent and moving expenses including furniture, initial grocery shopping, etc should be part of the deal.  I can understand not wanting to give her a big chunk of cash until she's been sober for an extended period of time, but refusing to use it to help her get on her feet would be punitive.", "I don't disagree that transitional housing is the better, choice, I just don't think OP and her husband can or should be her keeper or monitor. OP and her husband need rules to protect themselves. They are not his sister's keeper or crutch or therapists or sponsors and shouldn't put themselves in that position.", "Those are all very excellent points. I hope this comment ends up higher.", "Yep. My adopted kids' mom graduated from her 60 day rehab. We were all so proud of her, because it was the longest she'd been clean in at least 3 years. She opted to move in with my kids' dad (who claimed he was clean, but hadn't been drug tested in a while) rather than go to transitional housing, because she claimed there was too much drama amongst the girls in rehab, and she thought living with girls like them long term was bad for her mental health. Well, apparently that was the wrong choice. She failed her next drug test and stopped showing up for visitation or court, so our adoption was finalized 6 months later. Then she passed away from a dirty needle another 3 months later. Such a waste.\n\nIt sucks, but 60 days rehab IS NOT long enough to change your life.", "This is just my anecdotal bullshit, but my good friend and former roommate who is an alcoholic ended up in one of the city\u2019s worst apartments, and it was a huge turning point in his progression toward getting better. Running out of money to pay significant rent and people willing to take him in, he basically tough-loved himself. But a huge thing with him vs a lot of other alcoholics and drug users is he wanted most of all to stay alive. He unfortunately for us has benefited from moving far away to a city without his past troubles and triggers. He also had great success weaning himself from alcohol with cannabis, although it sounds like that\u2019s part of your step-daughter\u2019s issues.\n\nEdit: I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is: sure, apparently professionals say and you know as a professional that your house is not the best, but what I see is *it\u2019s literally where she was when she started abusing drugs*. A huge tell for me is her calling Florida \u201cboring.\u201d She doesn\u2019t need to be bored but she needs to find a new form of entertainment. She can find that in Florida or just about anywhere.", "Its long enough to get clean and make a decent start. But thats all. The real work occurs after.", "Best wishes for your kiddos. It\u2019s heartbreaking to lose a parent like that, no matter what the situation. \n\nPeople make LOADS of excuses for not wanting to live in a transitional house. \n\nOf course they do!\n\nLots of rules. Roommates. Curfews. Sterile living that doesn\u2019t really feel like \u201chome\u201d. Sometimes a chore chart. Lack of agency over what\u2019s served for dinner or what you can do with your time. \n\nA bigger one is tons of personality conflicts because *everyone there* is learning to re-wire their functioning and in a weird mental/emotional place, where you might not be the kindest, or easiest to share a room with. \n\nIt\u2019s not a good sign that SD describes herself as \u201crecovered\u201d after 60 days or less of inpatient treatment. She should have learned better in however long she\u2019s currently been in there, or she\u2019s really not ready to graduate. \n\nSD is young. We don\u2019t know what she learned from the program. Maybe she really can overcome and stay sober cold. Maybe she thinks she can beat the system and still use casually. So many maybes. \n\nBut Ive never met someone (heroin, meth, alcohol etc) who succeeds in a long term sobriety attempt while still holding on to the idea that the short stint in a clinical setting with medical detox is \u201call I need, I\u2019m recovered now\u201d with no long term treatment plans. \n\nESPECIALLY if they leave treatment and go back to a community where they used to use. There\u2019s a reason why judges, social workers (or the show Intervention) will send you as far away as possible from where you came from to do sobriety work. \n\nExceptions to every rule, of course. \n\nBut stats are not on SDs side here. \n\nYou never know, but if I were OP, I would have the same rules. Or. Realistically; I wouldn\u2019t allow her to move in at all, and would insist on a halfway system instead.", "Says the person calling addicts in recovery \"a bunch of addicts\".\n\nYou're both jerks.", "OK, but the step daughter did steal and lie, so her family has the right to assume the worst of her and be suspicious. She doesn\u2019t just get to say she\u2019s changed and expect everyone else to treat her as if she has. She has to actually put in the time and effort to prove she\u2019s changed and that will influence how she\u2019s treated.", "Your edit has major \"not like the other addicts\" energy.", "Wow. And how long have you been out of rehab?", "Barely even clean though, right? My youngest was born addicted and was at least 6 weeks old before she stopped shaking from withdrawal. And she was a year before she caught up on milestones.", "You\u2019re mad at this person for calling addicts \u201caddicts,\u201d the thing you just called them. If there\u2019s a bunch of them, it\u2019s a bunch of addicts."]}
