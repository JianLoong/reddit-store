My parents were married until my dad died when I was 7. Two years later mom met Mark and his daughter Olivia (now 19f as well). Olivia and I did not have a good start to our relationship. I was grieving my dad, she was feeling abandoned by her mom who walked out of her life and was angry that her dad wanted to date someone else. I found out like a year in that Olivia had chased off his dad's last girlfriend by bullying her preschoolers and the girlfriend until they left. It sort of annoyed me that Mark wanted to risk another woman and kid going through that. Olivia set her sights on me right away and she started to tease me about my looks. For the most part at that age I was the kid who would cry about it and my mom had to drag stuff out of me. By age 12 I started retaliating. My first retaliation was giving our half brother her favorite stuffed animal after she fed the photo I had of my dad and me on my nightstand to her dog. His signature was on the back so even though mom replaced the photo, it was never the same. The back and forth was our relationship for about 3 years.\n\nMy mom put me into therapy, she sat me down and talked to me numerous times, as well as punishing me for my retaliations. Eventually I did stop retaliating. I told mom I would ignore Olivia entirely. That I would pretend she does not exist to her face and she would need to accept that I would never see her as family and never, ever try to make things better between us. At first mom wanted me to agree to leave a tiny crack in the window for her, for the far future if Olivia changed. I told mom that was a firm no from me. My mom accepted that. Mark was as unhappy as mom was but he always left stuff with me to mom, just like mom left stuff with Olivia to Mark, because of the experiences we had with our bio parents (Olivia's mom leaving and my dad dying).\n\nOlivia and I were both in college but in April Olivia had to drop out after being diagnosed with cancer. I stayed local while she had moved states. I'm staying with my grandparents. Olivia moved back in with mom and Mark and they are struggling to juggle helping Olivia and everything else because they have younger kids. Mom asked me if I could help and so I help with my younger siblings. But they now want help with Olivia and apparently mom and Mark feel I should. It sounds like maybe they're expecting bad news eventually. They have those vibes about them. Mom mentioned Olivia had asked about me sometimes and whether I'd be visiting her or anything. I told mom I could not bring myself to do a thing for Olivia. She told me she could be dying. I said I know. But it does not change my stance on this.\n\nShe and Mark are really unhappy with me. Mark said Olivia wants to make things right and that despite our bad history, we're sisters, and wouldn't I want the chance to improve things between us? The truth is I would not.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1691662781, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15n8fz1/aita_for_not_helping_my_stepsister_out_while_she/", "score": 152, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your Mom and Stepdad just want your help so their lives are easier.  And Mark was fibbing when he said that Olivia \"wants to make things right\"; if Olivia wanted to apologize, she would have reached out on her own to do so.\n\nMom and Mark are capable of figuring out how to handle their responsibilities without you being an integral part of the plan.

School should be the priority though, and your own life.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIF your mom an Mak can not stop guilting you, go no contact with THEM.

I\u2019m so sorry with what you went through. I went through something completely different but the same. My bio sister and I had a tense relationship growing up. We didn\u2019t hang out or do things together. We were cordial growing up. Went to the same college\u2026we were cordial. She got married and had a kid then adopted. I got pregnant and was ignored by my family until I got married. (At which point they threw me a wedding shower\u2026at least she got a cake?) She then \u201caccidentally\u201d got pregnant and announced it within a few days of me giving birth. I think the day I came home from the shower she announced her pregnancy. She\u2019s stayed distant as an adult even though I tried. Then a few years ago she went bat poop crazy at my kiddos\u2019 birthday party. She spent most of the 3 yo and 10 yo\u2019s birthday party talking about things that would literally get me banned from Reddit. Someone would change the subject and she would bring it right back around 10 sentences later. She was the star of the party. After about 30 min of her discussing her client (she\u2019s a licensed counselor\u2026ALWAYS vet counselors and therapists well) I lost my cool. Yes I have great sympathy for what the dad did to your client\u2026but NOT APPROPRIATE!!! She got her feelings hurt bc talk about it helps HER process through things. By the end of the argument I left the room with her crying (I didn\u2019t validate her feelings in regards to her client in the middle of my children\u2019s birthday lol) and she looked at my husband who said (he told me later) \u201cyou know everyone has left but you and you\u2019re the only one screaming you\u2019re leaving.\u201d At which point she collected her children (I had the kids go outside before I addressed her.) and left. Later that night I texted her cutting contact. She contacted me more over that week (when I established boundaries for the first time in my life) than she had in ten years. My parents haven\u2019t forgiven me. \u201cFamily sticks together\u201d \u201cyou never turn your back on family\u201d \u201cyou always forgive family no matter what\u201d you know the toxic phrases that aren\u2019t used in healthy homes because they are never needed. I would be sad for my nibblings if she passed\u2026but in all honesty I\u2019m neutral on if she were to pass. I cut contact bc she wasn\u2019t mentally healthy and crossed boundaries (more stuff happened but you get the gist. Since cutting contact she has broke. The no contact with my kids repetitively when they are with my parents. Now my parents have boundaries and they don\u2019t understand why lol. They aren\u2019t happy with their boundaries either.) that I put in place. Maybe if she had followed my no contact from the beginning things would have turned out better. We would have had the opportunity to have cooled off, talked through things and mended some form of a relationship. But she didn\u2019t. She did what she wanted. I don\u2019t have to feel bad about her not respecting my boundaries. I don\u2019t have to feel bad that I needed to create boundaries for my physical and mental well being and that of my children. I am not responsible for my sister and her actions. I am not responsible for the consequences my sister faces. Nor are you.", "NTA. Olivia is facing her mortality. She is looking at the life she has lived and has found it wanting. \n\nMaybe she's truly remorseful and wants a relationship, maybe she's guilty and looking to clear her conscience, maybe your mom and Mark are making it up to try and \"fix\" your relationship before it's too late. Doesn't matter though, if you don't want to deal with the person who they allowed to torment you for years you don't have to.\n\nA little advice: if she dies and you never speak to her your mom and Mark may never forgive you, just the way you can't forgive Olivia. I'm not saying what you're doing is wrong, and I'm not saying it's fair, but their feelings are just as valid as yours. They're possibly losing a daughter, even if that daughter isn't a good person. Maybe there's some kind of compromise, albeit with strict boundaries and rules, that you could agree to for the sake of your relationship with your mother.", "Shouldn't the people with cancer receive the cancer treatment? Your title makes no sense.\n\nI've now read your post and while the title still makes little sense, this is a shitty background, and definitely NTA. You're not sisters, and even if you were, her behaviour has earned her no regard from you.\n\n\"She could be dieing!\"\n\"Ding dong!\"\nIs how I imagined your inner voice, so I commend your restraint.", "NTA. I know the cancer diagnosis is hard, but nothing about your relationship (or lack of one) has changed between you and Olivia. Continue to help with your younger siblings and free up time for your mom and stepdad to care for her.", "NTA.  It's not surprising your parents are clueless, expecting you to care for your tormenter.  Your mother and stepfather allowed Olivia to torment you and make your life hell.  You have no obligation to care for your stepsister or explain to your mother and stepfather your reasoning for not doing so.", "NTA. Your stance is fully justified. You have made it clear to your mom earlier and you are helping with the younger siblings.\n\nThe only thing I would say is that if your mom and dad are really struggling with things, then think of it as helping them and not Olivia. You have to decide if your issue with Olivia is more important than helping your parents. At the end, you know the exact details and how hard it really is or not.", "NTA but you might regret it in the futur.... \nAlso you had both trauma and it wasnt easy on her part either (not excusing it) part of adulthood is beiing able to take \u00e0 step back and look at the situation from your parents perspective poor some water in your wine.. the choice is ultimatly yours and yours only but may be just see how it goes and take the appropriate course of action.
