Your friend needs to acknowledge that you do face discrimination in spaces like that (even if they are quiet friendly) and they should be accommodating", "NTA you are not being homophobic.\n\nYour friend doesn't understand insectionality.", "NTA. Let your friend practice by sharing the poetry with you privately. You are not required to go anywhere that makes you uncomfortable to show your support.\n\nYou're friend's only an AH for being pissy about it.", "NTA\n\nWhile it may be a safe space for H, there is a strong possibility it will not be for you. H can read you their poetry at home.", "NTA.\n\nYou have not internalised homophobia you have experienced discrimination from a certain group and are wary of that now. As a fellow queer I can say I also often found queer spaces to contain a surprising amount of judgement and close mindedness. There is an expectation that you will have very specific politics, faith and dress and it can be hard feeling like you fit in or feel welcome, even when you're part of the exact group that's meant to be welcome .\n\nThat said that's not true for all queer spaces at all or by any means and maybe this place is different. There has recently been a politicisation of \"queerness\" to also somehow mean neoliberal and atheist and you are not wrong to have picked up on that in some queer spaces.\n\nYou don't have to go if you don't want to but I would say try to keep an open mind for other nights, if you like going to parties anyway, not all queer events will be like that.\n\nYou can also be someone who is proud of their faith and goes and if anyone comments on it you can call them out and stay proud and don't let it affect you. Those spaces are for you and you should feel safe there, it's a shame if you don't.\n\nYour friend is TA for not listening to your concern and just giving you the cold shoulder instead of talking it out.

From their POV, they've asked you to come to something very important to them, where they plan on opening up and being vulnerable with something they probably have not shared with anyone. They wanted you there because they trust you and want to share this with you, and being turned down \"because of well everything\" was probably very discouraging for them. \n\nI think you need to have a conversation with them where you reiterate what the \"well everything\" means, in case they might not be seeing this from your POV, but ultimately I think you need to expect them to be somewhat disappointed.

This is why intersectionality matters. Xenophobia happens even within one minority group because members of said minority group are part of other minority groups, and they get mistreated because of that. Racism is prevalent within LGBTQ+ circles. So is sexism. Members of one letter can be prejudiced against members of another letter. It never ends. Even with your religion, which isn't a minority, it's not okay for other people to be rude about it because that's something important to *you*, and there's nothing wrong with it as long as you're not using it as a excuse to hate others for no reason (which I assume you aren't).\n\nYou haven't internalized some weird homophobia.

It really depends on what \"cold shoulder,\" things they've been doing, since they might be processing emotions right now because of feelings of disappointment/rejection and need space or if they're being outright passive aggressive, then that would push it to NTA for me.\n\nYour friend might be also feeling hurt because of the perception that you may have implied they would *want* to go to queer spaces that were hostile to queer religious and/or POC intersectionality - they might be feeling that \"If OP didn't want to go there, they must think that place is \\_\\_\\_, which must mean they think that of me too?\" That's not how it actually works but someone who isn't used to prejudice based on race and/or religion (or having a lot of anxiety in general) might go through that thought process, even if that wasn't intended.", "Only in extremely online spaces and \"communities\" would you be considered the asshole. There is no reasonable person, argument, or set of circumstances by which refusing the invitation would make you an asshole. In fact, I'd go as far as to say H is an asshole for inviting you knowing the harassment you faced.", "NAH you're under no obligation to go BUT you're wrong about queer spaces. it is prejudice on your part, you're assuming they're against religion when I know quite a few religious queer people and no queer people who are anti religion. you shouldn't apply your negative experiences to all queer places, it's the definition of prejudice \n\nyour friend doesn't want to go to an event with you, they want you to show more support for their identity. they shouldn't be tying this to whether you go to an event or not though", "Is your religion one that is generally homophobic/anti-LGBT?

I mean if this particular space is like that then N T A.  But if you're just assuming that all queer spaces are going to be like that because you've had a couple bad experiences, that seems kinda prejudiced.  \n\nOn the other hand, I'm a middle aged white straight cis atheist, so what do I know?", "NTA but stop calling em queers lol", "Yes the fetishization in the gay community sucks and there is definitely a degree of vapidity and inconsideration that I find fascinating.

I identify as being queer and it\u2019s called a queer open mic night", "Okay but would you get up in my face and scream at me? Pull off my necklaces and religious jewellery? Shove me around?\n\nI have had serious trauma in my life too. The kind you can\u2019t mention in an AITA post. If I am triggered that doesn\u2019t give me license to harass or attack another person. That is my sincere belief", "Ah, yeah, we also call that BIPOC (Black/Indigenous/Person of Color).", "I thought it was Black African Methodist Episcopal. Or something religious that has AME in it.", "OP, all I can say is I am so sorry you are having to defend yourself. You friend is allowed to be a bit bummed you aren't coming, because it seems to be an important day for them. However, to expect you to put yourself in harm's way so they can feel confident is not acceptable. These spaces have gone out of their way to marginalize you and harm you. They should also be respectful that this likely makes the experience even more painful. The messaging of LGBTQ+ is that they are inclusive--to be from a minority religion that is already stigmatized by mainstream society and THEN be excluded again by the LGBTQ+ community is so painful. And then to likely be excluded in some capacity in one's religious community... I cannot imagine telling my friend to put themselves in a position to feel all of that.", "And that's absolutely not OPs fault at all.  It's like hating aperson because of what their nation's government did.  Irrational and harmful.", "She isn't assuming anything. People are openly hateful, spitting at her, and making her feeling unwelcome, even when she is openly wearing bi colors or pins. There is no excuse for that kind of behavior.", "So I only gave a vote YTA because enough people have given plenty of explanations for either side, but if you want to know, the issue stems from her generalizing the LGBT community. Unlike religious communities, there are no books or scriptures that say to kill abuse harass or whatever towards other people. There's no reason to believe that this place would be anything but welcoming. Especially during this time where it seems the Israel Hamas war has turned alot of people sympathetic towards the Muslim community. (I disagree with it but whatever)", "Yup", "Same!", "Nope", "Ty ty", "I\u2019m talking about repetitive behaviour over decades mate\n\nI\u2019m talking about being verbally and physically harassed over and over again\n\nI\u2019m talking about being objectified because I have \u201cweird\u201d hair and dark skin and grey eyes and apparently that means it\u2019s fine to sexualise me and objectify me\n\nAlso your entire thing is in bad faith \u201cother people thought about this and decided NTA so I\u2019m going to go YTA\u201d", "I.E  Muslim right? All Abrahamic religions are built on hate.", "It\u2019s probably one of them, I don\u2019t know too many religions that are progressive. \n\nBut even a follower can have views that don\u2019t align with the religion. I know die hard Catholics that support gay rights. Judging someone purely off their religion is the same as judging someone purely off their orientation.", "As a Pagan, I've very little reason to stand up for any of the Abrahamic faiths but I will just say that every single faith on this planet has been bastardized from its true intent because of its people.\n\nNo path of Christianity is the same but quite a few of them do preach love and acceptance. If your first thought when you hear someone is Christian without getting to know them and your first thought is to treat them as though they're a dog who could snap at any moment then you're really no better than the people who tip-toed around you like you were a walking plague bomb.  \n\n\nIf bigotry is never okay, then that also counts when trauma is involved. Trauma can be an explanation but it will never be an excuse. Doing so allows wiggle room."]}
