However, before I make a judgement, I need to know what a BAME background is.\n\nI-N-F-O\n\nEdited to change my vote to NTA", "NTA, this is something a lot of my friends in the lgbt+ Muslim community face personally (esp hijabis who cover.) Your friend needs to acknowledge that you do face discrimination in spaces like that (even if they are quiet friendly) and they should be accommodating", "NTA you are not being homophobic.\n\nYour friend doesn't understand insectionality.", "NTA. Let your friend practice by sharing the poetry with you privately. You are not required to go anywhere that makes you uncomfortable to show your support.\n\nYou're friend's only an AH for being pissy about it.", "NTA\n\nWhile it may be a safe space for H, there is a strong possibility it will not be for you. H can read you their poetry at home.", "NTA.\n\nYou have not internalised homophobia you have experienced discrimination from a certain group and are wary of that now. As a fellow queer I can say I also often found queer spaces to contain a surprising amount of judgement and close mindedness. There is an expectation that you will have very specific politics, faith and dress and it can be hard feeling like you fit in or feel welcome, even when you're part of the exact group that's meant to be welcome .\n\nThat said that's not true for all queer spaces at all or by any means and maybe this place is different. There has recently been a politicisation of \"queerness\" to also somehow mean neoliberal and atheist and you are not wrong to have picked up on that in some queer spaces.\n\nYou don't have to go if you don't want to but I would say try to keep an open mind for other nights, if you like going to parties anyway, not all queer events will be like that.\n\nYou can also be someone who is proud of their faith and goes and if anyone comments on it you can call them out and stay proud and don't let it affect you. Those spaces are for you and you should feel safe there, it's a shame if you don't.\n\nYour friend is TA for not listening to your concern and just giving you the cold shoulder instead of talking it out. Try and talk to them!", "NTA, why would you go out of your way to make yourself feel like shit?  You don\u2019t owe that to anyone.", "NAH And I'll tell you why your friend is not an AH. From their POV, they've asked you to come to something very important to them, where they plan on opening up and being vulnerable with something they probably have not shared with anyone. They wanted you there because they trust you and want to share this with you, and being turned down \"because of well everything\" was probably very discouraging for them. \n\nI think you need to have a conversation with them where you reiterate what the \"well everything\" means, in case they might not be seeing this from your POV, but ultimately I think you need to expect them to be somewhat disappointed. At the end of the day, no matter how good your reasons are, it's still a rejection, and even if they understand your reasons, it's still gonna hurt.", "NTA. You don\u2019t have to go if you don\u2019t want to.", "NTA, unfortunately that scene isn't the most tolerant of those who don't share their explicit views.. funnily enough lol.", "NTA. This is why intersectionality matters. Xenophobia happens even within one minority group because members of said minority group are part of other minority groups, and they get mistreated because of that. Racism is prevalent within LGBTQ+ circles. So is sexism. Members of one letter can be prejudiced against members of another letter. It never ends. Even with your religion, which isn't a minority, it's not okay for other people to be rude about it because that's something important to *you*, and there's nothing wrong with it as long as you're not using it as a excuse to hate others for no reason (which I assume you aren't).\n\nYou haven't internalized some weird homophobia. You're afraid of being a victim of xenophobia, which is a valid concern.", "You do not have to make yourself uncountable to comfort someone else. Do not put yourself in a situation you don't want to be in just to accommodate someone else.\n\nNta.\n\nI'll say what others have said here... tell H. Send them this.", "There is many layers to this but I want to say somewhere between... NTA and NAH, I suppose? It really depends on what \"cold shoulder,\" things they've been doing, since they might be processing emotions right now because of feelings of disappointment/rejection and need space or if they're being outright passive aggressive, then that would push it to NTA for me.\n\nYour friend might be also feeling hurt because of the perception that you may have implied they would *want* to go to queer spaces that were hostile to queer religious and/or POC intersectionality - they might be feeling that \"If OP didn't want to go there, they must think that place is \\_\\_\\_, which must mean they think that of me too?\" That's not how it actually works but someone who isn't used to prejudice based on race and/or religion (or having a lot of anxiety in general) might go through that thought process, even if that wasn't intended.", "Only in extremely online spaces and \"communities\" would you be considered the asshole. There is no reasonable person, argument, or set of circumstances by which refusing the invitation would make you an asshole. In fact, I'd go as far as to say H is an asshole for inviting you knowing the harassment you faced.", "NAH you're under no obligation to go BUT you're wrong about queer spaces. it is prejudice on your part, you're assuming they're against religion when I know quite a few religious queer people and no queer people who are anti religion. you shouldn't apply your negative experiences to all queer places, it's the definition of prejudice \n\nyour friend doesn't want to go to an event with you, they want you to show more support for their identity. they shouldn't be tying this to whether you go to an event or not though", "Is your religion one that is generally homophobic/anti-LGBT? Maybe your friend is more upset about that then this particular event.", "NTA\n\nOne does not need to give a reason for not wanting to go.\n\nYou said no, that means no.\n\nYour friend seems controling and selfish.\nI would say friend is AH", "Too many abbreviations to completely understand.", "IDK.  I mean if this particular space is like that then N T A.  But if you're just assuming that all queer spaces are going to be like that because you've had a couple bad experiences, that seems kinda prejudiced.  \n\nOn the other hand, I'm a middle aged white straight cis atheist, so what do I know?", "NTA but stop calling em queers lol", "Yes the fetishization in the gay community sucks and there is definitely a degree of vapidity and inconsideration that I find fascinating. So NTA for not going; queer people are allowed to queer out in many different ways.\n\nBut YTA for prioritizing religion over it seems most things. Automatic asshole, for having a backwards, uninformed worldview and being apparently proud of it.", "NTA.\n\nPlease point out to your friend that deliberately taking you to a place where you'll be harassed and humiliated for something you can't control is not a safe place.", "Im bi too and can't stand LGBTQ+ events, every conversation and \"joke\" always boils down to sex, religion and kink stuff and the general stereotypes, it's both boring and obnoxious. The poetry is always awful too.\n\nIt's always why I've stopped going to pride events, the kink communities who go there to do weird shit put me off and are the reason the media has such an easy time villainising every day queer folk\n\nNTA", "Yta", "Send H this post", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
