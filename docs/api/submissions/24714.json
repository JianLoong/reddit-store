Majorly NTA.\n\nFirst, your uncle is a chunkhead for adopting two new dogs right before leaving them with someone else for TWO WEEKS.\n\nSecond, unless you were contracted to also be a housekeeper/cleaner, how the hell were you supposed to know that he left an expensive pair of shoes under the couch???

I would highly advise you to set clear boundaries and never help him out again. At least as long as he isn't paying you.", "NTA. Uncles a dumba**. And probably has issues if he thinks this is a thing.", "NTA and your uncle just lost a conscientious, FREE dog sitter.", "NTA - He change the dynamic two days before he left on vacation with the addition of strange dogs into his home.  His circus, his monkeys.  He is to blame not you.", "NTA.  There's no way you could have prevented it and asking one person to watch three dogs, two recently from the shelter with behavior issues, is just asking for something to get destroyed.", "NTA, you watched the dogs for FREE for 2 weeks and you ended up having to watch a total of 5 pets. You can\u2019t control that one of the dogs ended up chewing his expensive shoes. If anything your uncle should\u2019ve made sure that everything that could be chewed up or damaged was locked away or something.", "NTA. It's his house, he put the shoes there, and his dogs destroyed them. He knew next to nothing about the dogs and did not warn you about the chewing or ask you to keep an eye on it. You literally did nothing wrong. He's SOL on this one.\n\nAlso, you dog sat for free. Tell him the going rate for pet sitters is about $50 a day, so next time he asks you to watch his dogs for two weeks, you're charging him $700.", "NTA, he should have waited to adopt til after his vacation. He didn't know the dogs well enough to just leave them for a week? Or however long he was gone. Plus you did it for free?! Yeah, no, you shouldn't have to pay for shit.", "Nta does he expect you to clean up his shoes and magically know where he\u2019s left his stuff lying around.", "NTA you did your best in taking care of them. It's not like you were to know 'an expensive' pair of shoes was under the couch. If they were so expensive why weren't they somewhere safe! \n\nAnimals are curious and would venture/rummage into anything. Your uncle is at fault here and you don't owe him anything.

Your uncle took full advantage of your generosity.", "NTA and who the hell adopts TWO dogs 2 days before leaving for a vacation that lasts 14 days?! That should be illegal. Also, shoes under a couch?

You can't be watching them 24/7, had no idea the shoes were there, aren't being paid to TRAIN these dogs, and are absolutely not responsible for damage done by HIS DOGS to something HE LEFT HIDDEN AROUND THE HOUSE.

Also he left shoes there. His mistake", "NTA", "NTA - The cost for pet sitting is high, he should be grateful he saved money with you.", "NTA.  It was your uncles new dogs who chewed his own shoes that he left in a place that they could get.  He was irresponsible.  Did he expect you to read the puppies mind and foresee which object it would chew, and remove them from the environment?  I mean seriously, he's being ridiculous", "Absolutely NTA.  He didn\u2019t pay you?  Jeez.  Of course you don\u2019t owe anything.  I wouldn\u2019t ask you to pay for the wrecked item even if you had been paid.\n\nTwo weeks of pet sitting for that many animals is probably near 2k in the open market, he needs to get some perspective on your gift.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I also usually charged $0.25-0.50/mile round trip per day because some of my clients lived further out and it was a hike. \n\nI didn't offer full day care, though. It was pretty much a 7pm-7am gig, because I worked 10 hour shifts at the vet hospital.  So for an overnight cost, and often things not being that much harder with more dogs (especially with a yard), it was a decent rate.", "You have saved more than destroyed. Never again, dear uncle!
