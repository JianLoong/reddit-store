It was extremely irresponsible of your uncle to adopt two dogs and then leave right away for vacation. Don't pay him for the shoes.", "NTA\n\nIf he wants to bill you for the the shoes, you can bill him for your time.   \nI bet your services would cost him a lot more than the shoes.", "NTA. He gets the service he pays for. Beyond that, for him to adopt 2 dogs right before going out of town is a huge dick move to both you and the dogs.", "NTA. Majorly NTA.\n\nFirst, your uncle is a chunkhead for adopting two new dogs right before leaving them with someone else for TWO WEEKS.\n\nSecond, unless you were contracted to also be a housekeeper/cleaner, how the hell were you supposed to know that he left an expensive pair of shoes under the couch??? His carelessness is not your problem.\n\nBoth are 100% his fault, 0% yours", "NTA.  The title I thought you were going to say you smashed a plate or something, but no this is entirely not on you.  Who adopts dogs 2 day before going away for 2 weeks...?!", "NTA. \n\nHIS dog chewed up HIS shoes that HE didn't put away. This is a HIM problem.", "NTA\n\nYour uncle adopted two brand new dogs, and was then surprised when they chewed his leather shoes that were left under the couch. Has your uncle actually met dogs before?", "NTA. His own fault for adopting a dog two days before going away and not securing his possessions, what were you supposed to do, follow the dogs every minute of the day?", "NTA.\n\nYour uncle sounds like an entitled person.", "NTA \n\nHe set you up for failure. I would highly advise you to set clear boundaries and never help him out again. At least as long as he isn't paying you.", "NTA. Uncles a dumba**. And probably has issues if he thinks this is a thing.", "NTA and your uncle just lost a conscientious, FREE dog sitter.", "NTA - He change the dynamic two days before he left on vacation with the addition of strange dogs into his home.  His circus, his monkeys.  He is to blame not you.", "NTA.  There's no way you could have prevented it and asking one person to watch three dogs, two recently from the shelter with behavior issues, is just asking for something to get destroyed.", "NTA, you watched the dogs for FREE for 2 weeks and you ended up having to watch a total of 5 pets. You can\u2019t control that one of the dogs ended up chewing his expensive shoes. If anything your uncle should\u2019ve made sure that everything that could be chewed up or damaged was locked away or something.", "NTA. It's his house, he put the shoes there, and his dogs destroyed them. He knew next to nothing about the dogs and did not warn you about the chewing or ask you to keep an eye on it. You literally did nothing wrong. He's SOL on this one.\n\nAlso, you dog sat for free. Tell him the going rate for pet sitters is about $50 a day, so next time he asks you to watch his dogs for two weeks, you're charging him $700.", "NTA, he should have waited to adopt til after his vacation. He didn't know the dogs well enough to just leave them for a week? Or however long he was gone. Plus you did it for free?! Yeah, no, you shouldn't have to pay for shit.", "Nta does he expect you to clean up his shoes and magically know where he\u2019s left his stuff lying around.", "NTA you did your best in taking care of them. It's not like you were to know 'an expensive' pair of shoes was under the couch. If they were so expensive why weren't they somewhere safe! \n\nAnimals are curious and would venture/rummage into anything. Your uncle is at fault here and you don't owe him anything. Expect a NO the next time he asks you for a free favour that ends up costing you money.", "NTA\n\nrule #1 of pet ownership, your pet is not to blame if you leave something they can access and destroy. If it\u2019s important to you, put it away.\n\nintroducing 2 more dogs with unknown habits is begging for trouble if you don\u2019t abide rule #1 above\n\ntell him to try taking the offending dog who destroyed his expensive shoes to small claims court as he\u2019ll get the same result from you", "NTA. \n\nNext time, don't pet sit for free. Your uncle took full advantage of your generosity.", "NTA and who the hell adopts TWO dogs 2 days before leaving for a vacation that lasts 14 days?! That should be illegal. Also, shoes under a couch? If they\u2019re so expensive, they shouldn\u2019t be laying around the house with 3 dogs and 2 cats.", "NTA , kinda think your uncle is for being so careless with new dogs.", "NTA\nAnd you could tell him you will refund the entire fee he paid you \ud83d\ude42", "NTA. IT was HIS negligence that caused his loss.", "NTA. He's being ridiculous and I wouldn't even discuss it with him further. You did this as a FAVOR. And he's the one who left expensive shoes under the couch in a house with two BRAND NEW shelter dogs in addition to existing dogs. You can't be watching them 24/7, had no idea the shoes were there, aren't being paid to TRAIN these dogs, and are absolutely not responsible for damage done by HIS DOGS to something HE LEFT HIDDEN AROUND THE HOUSE. Sounds like he took advantage of you to begin with, and is now trying to get money FROM you? Absolutely not.", "Nta you are right, he can\u2019t add 2 new dogs and not expect hick ups. Also he left shoes there. His mistake", "NTA", "NTA - The cost for pet sitting is high, he should be grateful he saved money with you.", "NTA.  It was your uncles new dogs who chewed his own shoes that he left in a place that they could get.  He was irresponsible.  Did he expect you to read the puppies mind and foresee which object it would chew, and remove them from the environment?  I mean seriously, he's being ridiculous", "Absolutely NTA.  He didn\u2019t pay you?  Jeez.  Of course you don\u2019t owe anything.  I wouldn\u2019t ask you to pay for the wrecked item even if you had been paid.\n\nTwo weeks of pet sitting for that many animals is probably near 2k in the open market, he needs to get some perspective on your gift.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
