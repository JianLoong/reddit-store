Should have taken the dogs back to the shelter though, disgustingly irresponsible to adopt two new dogs then immediately go away for two weeks. No one remotely sane would hold you responsible for anything. If he was adopting new dogs who he doesn't know, doesn't know how they behave then it's both his job to train them, his job to get them used to the house and his job to clean up his own house and protect whatever he wants protecting. \n\nExpecting someone house/pet sitting to tidy up your house and protect your things is ridiculous.", "Ask him to deduct the cost of the shoes from your 2 week pet sitting payment of $700", "NTA, your uncle is a doofus."]}
