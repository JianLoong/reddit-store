High school can be a cruel, cruel place, and it might be causing them some reputation issues. Meanwhile, you're getting off of work and probably just want to go home.

They need to learn, obviously, but I do get it. I remember how I was at that age, and I did stuff that was just as entitled back then. It's easy to forget the stupid things that we did back then because we eventually learned better (hopefully), but we had to get taught that lesson first. Still, you're not an AH in this case.
