My MIL is a very sweet woman who also happens to have a very serious genetic disability, and has had an extremely difficult life as a result. Annie has been denied a lot of opportunities for independence because of this. My GMIL, MIL's mother, has sort of pushed her into the role of an emotional support dog for her mom. She wasn't able to have friends over because they would be too stressful for her mother. She couldn't go to see friends either though, or be in any clubs or after-school activities, because her mother would throw a tantrum if she was away from her for too long.

She's an amazing, wonderful woman who deserves to be able to have her own life, and I was recently able to convince her to marry me and run away together. We're going across the country after Christmas, and I've never felt brighter or lighter. Annie is the best person I know.

She saw Annie's discord messages, and she confronted us both yesterday. She says that without Annie's help, she won't be able to manage MIL, and she'll end up in a care facility. She also said that without Annie around, MIL will have nothing to live for, and brought up how Annie was conceived. Annie was crying, and apologizing, and I basically told GMIL that Annie didn't do anything wrong, and we were going no matter what. GMIL said I'm a \"villainous interloper\" who can't understand their family's values. She's right that MIL will break down without Annie. When she visited me for a week last year, she had to go back after four days because MIL had a complete breakdown and ended up in the hospital.\n\nTL;DR: My fiancee and I want to move across the country and start our own lives, but her disabled mother can't cope with her leaving.

No child should ever be put in Annie's position. It is possible that MIL will end up in an institution if she doesn't have her daughter around 24/7. In that case, that is where she belongs. It is sad that she is this unwell but that does not entitle her to suck the life out of Annie. It sounds like emotional abuse all through her childhood and youth and it has to stop! Annie probably needs a good stint of therapy before she is ready to move to the litle house in the woods ...", "NTA. Reading between the lines here, GMIL didn\u2019t protect her own daughter and is projecting her failure on your fianc\u00e9e. \n\nMIL will almost certainly have to go to a care facility. Is Annie ok with that?", "Reading between the lines here it sounds like MIL has the mental capacity of a small child and Annie was the result of a sexual assault. GMIL clearly handled everything wrong, and Annie and GMIL should have both had therapy so they would know how to deal with all of this. Running away isn't going to make everything better. Annie needs more help than that. The best place for MIL is a care facility that will help her through the transition, and Annie needs therapy to deal with years of trauma. Her life has revolved around this and you can't run away from that, the feelings don't just go away because of space. She will likely have misplaced guilt of it, which is normal even when she shouldn't feel guilty. This can't be fixed just by moving.", "Why doesn\u2019t anyone ask what ANNIE wants?", "NTA. GMIL ruined Annie's life by forcing her to be a caregiver for MIL. This is called parentification. GMIL should have hired a caregiver a very long time ago to care for MIL. You and Annie need to move on with your lives and get out of this toxic environment. You and Annie need to have a meeting with MIL and GMIL and make it clear that you need to move on with your lives. MIL might have depression and other problems, but she should have sought professional help a long time ago. Stop allowing GMIL to make you feel guilty, please.", "Ya know what I don\u2019t see here? Anyone talking about what Annie actually wants. Does she actually want to marry you and run away or did you just \u201cconvince\u201d or manipulate her into doing that?", "NTA. Annie deserves to live life. What you don't get to do though is make decisions for Annie. Annie needs to stand up for herself and the both of you need to make collaborative decisions. With all due respect, it sounds like you are leading the entire way. Has Annie voiced anything proudly in agreeance with you? If not, that is a red flag. Annie also needs therapy to help her with her feelings, and opinions, and should utilize her voice. For example, why is all of this on Discord messages and Annie hasn't spoken to her mom and grandmother about a move happening in the New Year, which is a few weeks away? She is an adult. That should have been number one. When and if you both leave, also realize that the guilt will rise and her support system other than you will be gone. That can potentially alter your relationship drastically. She isn't moving down the street or an hour away but across the country. I'm glad you are both in love, engaged, and have plans, but this is a lot for both of you and I hope you both know what you are getting into. I just haven't heard of the work Annie is doing to mentally, spiritually, and emotionally to get ready for this big jump.", "ESH because it doesn't sound like Annie is making these decisions about what she wants her life to be, more that you're giving her an escape route from a bad situation and she's along for the ride. And while GMIL sounds like an abusive and awful person, it doesn't sound like Annie is ready to confront her, especially at the level of confrontation that you're escalating to.\n\nWhile \"let's run away together\" is romantic in theory, it's not practical nor is it kind. It sounds like MIL isn't abusive but actually essentially at the mercy of GMIL herself. The responsible, helpful, and loving thing would be to contact local resources (in my community, it's called Senior and Disabled Services) and explain the situation, including the abusive behavior of GMIL, and ask how MIL can receive care and protection. If you actually helped Annie create a care plan for her mother, she could move forward in her life with a clear conscience and you'd both be justified in flipping GMIL the bird on your way out of town. As it is, you're making Annie choose between you and a lifetime obligation that she can't just mentally and emotionally drop on a dime because she met you. \n\nPlease show patience with Annie and care for her mother. No, this should not have been Annie's duty, but there is a better path forward.", "This is your finacee's chance to get away from the abuse she has lived with all of her life.\n\nThe circumstances of her conception are not her fault and she does not owe anyone anything due to that. She is used and manipulated and used to that. She will need therapy to get over it. Or at least come to terms with it.\n\nCan you leave any earlier? Get her documents and important things together and away from her family.   \n\nAlso - when she visited you for a week she had to go back after four days.... no she did not. She felt she had to. She needs to learn the difference.\n\nNTA", "NTA; what an awful, unfair burden to put on someone. What a nightmare of a childhood. I honestly think what they have done is evil.", "NTA you are saving her", "Nta", "As a true mother I would want my children to be happy! And live their lives to the fullest. My name is Annie and I\u2019m telling Annie she has the right to live life and build a happy life. I hope she feels free to do this", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthis is easy: Either your fiancee can priorize your relationship over her mom, or you will need to break up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd you likely will need to go no contact with your abusive MIL and GMIL. They don'T care for her, they just use her for their comfort.", "OK, so frasing, you sound abusive as well.

GMIL has used Annie and guilted her over the years on caring for MIL, giving up her life in the process. Has GMIL made the same sacrifice as Annie? I feel bad for Annie not having a mother to care and guide for her, and it sounds like GMIL, instead of being - at the very least - a partner and mentor to Annie, has used her own granddaughter since she cannot care for her own daughter (MIL). Go find your happy Annie! Sounds like you've never lived your life.", "You and Annie are both NTA and her GMIL is off the wall.\n\nThere are MANY resources available for Annie's mother, but it doesn't sound as if the mother or the grandmother have even begun to explore them. For example, is her mother on Medicaid/Medicare? Have they looked into having a visiting nurse and homemaker come in to help? I'll take it as a given that the mother has NOT had psychotherapy, but that could be extremely helpful as well. \n\nI hope that you can help Annie to stay strong and recognize that she has a right to her own life. This may require Annie herself to get counseling - would you be willing to make that joint counseling, OP, go with her and participate in the sessions? This is a tremendous challenge for Annie, and the more that you understand about where she's coming from the better; having you participate might also help her to shift her identity from caretaking-daughter-of-Mommy-and-nothing-else to independent woman who's choosing to become a wife. All the best to both of you!", "NTA.  Get Annie into therapy now to help her understand (before you go) that it isn\u2019t her responsibility to be her moms emotional support animal.  (Virtual if needed).  Having that outside validation from a professional will help her process her emotions better when the time comes", "What does GMIL mean?", "Need more info. Does Annie understand she is being manipulated? She needs therapy big time to unwind that guilt she was burdened with her whole life. It\u2019s not something you can power through for her/the both of you. If she can independently work through it with a therapist, your relationship will be stronger for it. \n\nAnnie needs to understand that MIL needs to be in a care home if Annie is to have any sort of life- her own kids/family, friends, romantic relationships.", "You aren\u2019t required to set yourself on fire just because it will keep someone else warm. GMIL could have adopted Annie out but didn\u2019t as she viewed her as a cheap built in caregiver. Annie needs to own her own life.", "I don't believe MIL has the mental capacity to be abusive. GMIL, on the other hand, I loathe, but I do feel horrible for MIL.  She's had a horrible life.", "That is the reason why I have told my daughter's to find a a good care home and put me in if needed. I don't want to be a burden for them, they keep telling me they have one already picked out for me lol. I am 70 now and still quite fit but you never know what's around the corner for anyone.", "We both feel horrible about that, but the alternative is for Annie to give up her entire life just to take care of MIL. I want better for her, and I've been able to convince her that she deserves better too. I think if MIL were able to truly understand the situation, it's what she would want for Annie too.", "MIL has very limited mental capacities and I don't know that she would be able to understand therapy.", "This! I\u2019m not saying OP is bad guy but this is more complicated than I think either of them realize. Annie needs therapy to deal with the years of emotional abuse she\u2019s suffered. Leaving will not magically make everything better..", "Right?!? OP\u2019s not the hero he\u2019s trying to portray here. I\u2019m sensing selfishness and a controlling attitude on his part.", "Grandmother in law", "Telling Annie that she can't have friends or extra curriculars because her mother will flip if she isn't around is in and of itself abusive! I am astonished that you don't see it.", "How the hell did MIL have a kid if she\u2019s so profoundly disabled?", "If you can afford it and are in the US, long term care insurance is one of the best gifts you can give yourself and your family", "Do not underestimate what Annie will be going through once she leaves.  She will experience emotions and guilt greater than what you can probably handle.  I would try to find professional help for her as immediately.", "It is not Annie\u2019s responsibility. It will be hard for her and she should be in therapy etc but the healthiest thing for her is to put herself and her future first.", "Not to be rude, but was the MIL taken advantage of and your girlfriend was the result.  Unless she has gotten a lot worse as she ages it sounds like she wouldn\u2019t have been able to give consent.", "Aaah thank you!", "GMIL made those rules, not MIL. I agree that was abusive.", "You need to read more carefully. OP covered all this.", "\u201c\u2026 brought up how Annie was conceived\u2026\u201d\n\nMy guess is that the story is somewhere in there.", "Women with severe disabilities are often the victims of sexual assault.", "Think for a minute", "I think OP is pretty clearly implying that that's the case.", "Yes, that is clearly what is being said here.
