No child should ever be put in Annie's position. It is possible that MIL will end up in an institution if she doesn't have her daughter around 24/7. In that case, that is where she belongs. It is sad that she is this unwell but that does not entitle her to suck the life out of Annie. It sounds like emotional abuse all through her childhood and youth and it has to stop! Annie probably needs a good stint of therapy before she is ready to move to the litle house in the woods ...", "NTA. Reading between the lines here, GMIL didn\u2019t protect her own daughter and is projecting her failure on your fianc\u00e9e. \n\nMIL will almost certainly have to go to a care facility. Is Annie ok with that?", "Reading between the lines here it sounds like MIL has the mental capacity of a small child and Annie was the result of a sexual assault. GMIL clearly handled everything wrong, and Annie and GMIL should have both had therapy so they would know how to deal with all of this. Running away isn't going to make everything better. Annie needs more help than that. The best place for MIL is a care facility that will help her through the transition, and Annie needs therapy to deal with years of trauma. Her life has revolved around this and you can't run away from that, the feelings don't just go away because of space. She will likely have misplaced guilt of it, which is normal even when she shouldn't feel guilty. This can't be fixed just by moving.", "Why doesn\u2019t anyone ask what ANNIE wants?", "NTA. GMIL ruined Annie's life by forcing her to be a caregiver for MIL. This is called parentification. GMIL should have hired a caregiver a very long time ago to care for MIL. You and Annie need to move on with your lives and get out of this toxic environment. You and Annie need to have a meeting with MIL and GMIL and make it clear that you need to move on with your lives. MIL might have depression and other problems, but she should have sought professional help a long time ago. Stop allowing GMIL to make you feel guilty, please.", "Ya know what I don\u2019t see here? Anyone talking about what Annie actually wants. Does she actually want to marry you and run away or did you just \u201cconvince\u201d or manipulate her into doing that?", "NTA. Annie deserves to live life. What you don't get to do though is make decisions for Annie. Annie needs to stand up for herself and the both of you need to make collaborative decisions. With all due respect, it sounds like you are leading the entire way. Has Annie voiced anything proudly in agreeance with you? If not, that is a red flag. Annie also needs therapy to help her with her feelings, and opinions, and should utilize her voice. For example, why is all of this on Discord messages and Annie hasn't spoken to her mom and grandmother about a move happening in the New Year, which is a few weeks away? She is an adult. That should have been number one. When and if you both leave, also realize that the guilt will rise and her support system other than you will be gone. That can potentially alter your relationship drastically. She isn't moving down the street or an hour away but across the country. I'm glad you are both in love, engaged, and have plans, but this is a lot for both of you and I hope you both know what you are getting into. I just haven't heard of the work Annie is doing to mentally, spiritually, and emotionally to get ready for this big jump.", "ESH because it doesn't sound like Annie is making these decisions about what she wants her life to be, more that you're giving her an escape route from a bad situation and she's along for the ride. And while GMIL sounds like an abusive and awful person, it doesn't sound like Annie is ready to confront her, especially at the level of confrontation that you're escalating to.\n\nWhile \"let's run away together\" is romantic in theory, it's not practical nor is it kind. It sounds like MIL isn't abusive but actually essentially at the mercy of GMIL herself. The responsible, helpful, and loving thing would be to contact local resources (in my community, it's called Senior and Disabled Services) and explain the situation, including the abusive behavior of GMIL, and ask how MIL can receive care and protection. If you actually helped Annie create a care plan for her mother, she could move forward in her life with a clear conscience and you'd both be justified in flipping GMIL the bird on your way out of town. As it is, you're making Annie choose between you and a lifetime obligation that she can't just mentally and emotionally drop on a dime because she met you. \n\nPlease show patience with Annie and care for her mother. No, this should not have been Annie's duty, but there is a better path forward.", "This is your finacee's chance to get away from the abuse she has lived with all of her life.\n\nThe circumstances of her conception are not her fault and she does not owe anyone anything due to that. She is used and manipulated and used to that. She will need therapy to get over it. Or at least come to terms with it.\n\nCan you leave any earlier? Get her documents and important things together and away from her family.   \n\nAlso - when she visited you for a week she had to go back after four days.... no she did not. She felt she had to.

GMIL has used Annie and guilted her over the years on caring for MIL, giving up her life in the process. Has GMIL made the same sacrifice as Annie? I feel bad for Annie not having a mother to care and guide for her, and it sounds like GMIL, instead of being - at the very least - a partner and mentor to Annie, has used her own granddaughter since she cannot care for her own daughter (MIL). Go find your happy Annie! Sounds like you've never lived your life.", "You and Annie are both NTA and her GMIL is off the wall.\n\nThere are MANY resources available for Annie's mother, but it doesn't sound as if the mother or the grandmother have even begun to explore them. For example, is her mother on Medicaid/Medicare? Have they looked into having a visiting nurse and homemaker come in to help? I'll take it as a given that the mother has NOT had psychotherapy, but that could be extremely helpful as well. \n\nI hope that you can help Annie to stay strong and recognize that she has a right to her own life. This may require Annie herself to get counseling - would you be willing to make that joint counseling, OP, go with her and participate in the sessions? This is a tremendous challenge for Annie, and the more that you understand about where she's coming from the better; having you participate might also help her to shift her identity from caretaking-daughter-of-Mommy-and-nothing-else to independent woman who's choosing to become a wife. All the best to both of you!", "NTA.  Get Annie into therapy now to help her understand (before you go) that it isn\u2019t her responsibility to be her moms emotional support animal.

Does Annie understand she is being manipulated? She needs therapy big time to unwind that guilt she was burdened with her whole life. It\u2019s not something you can power through for her/the both of you.

I am 70 now and still quite fit but you never know what's around the corner for anyone.", "We both feel horrible about that, but the alternative is for Annie to give up her entire life just to take care of MIL.

If MIL goes to a care facility surely Annie would want to visit and to make sure she is treated well.  As you say, MIL had a hard life.", "NTA. Annie needs to stand up to her grandmother's manipulation tactics and decide what type of life she wants. This is abusive to socially impede Annie all of her life this way.  Mom needs to go to a facility, Annie needs to have a conversation, \"I love you mom but I have been restricted my entire life to cater to your needs; it is time I live my own life now and for you not to want that is extremely selfish.\"  It is grandma's turn now to put her life on hold or go visit her daughter at the facility.", "NTA at all.

Clearly NTA. \nB. Could you move MIL to a care facility closer to where you're moving so Annie can visit easily? It will be an adjustment, but it would be the kindest option", "I don't know, this is a tough situation. GMIL is absolutely a villain in this story - she's been cruel and selfish and manipulative towards Annie since Annie was born, and she gets no sympathy from me.\n\nBut as for the other actors...\n\nOn the one hand, yes, Annie deserves to live her life. But does SHE want to leave her poor mom alone, uncared for and possibly in the hospital? I understand the joy you both have found in each other, but is there some medium ground here where you move out but closer by, so Annie can visit her mom in the care facility? (Also, it does sound like MIL should be in a care facility - if she can't be a week on her own, that's really rough)\n\nI guess what I'm saying is: does the best version of both of your lives really have to involve leaving Annie's disabled mom so VERY alone and in the lurch? If it does, god be with you, but part of me isn't so sure. You say \"I was recently able to convince her to marry me and run away together\" -- did you do all the convincing here, OP? Are we sure this is really Annie's dream, too? I deeply love and care for my mother, and if she needed full-time care like this, I'd be devastated if someone told me to run away across country and leave her to suffer alone. I'd feel like I was choosing between my mom and my lover, tbh, which sucks.", "YTA at least a little.  As I read your post, I get vibes that Annie is moving from one manipulator to another.  \n\u201cRun away??!\u201d  That makes you sound like a child. \nLike it or not familial ties are a thing.  That doesn\u2019t mean that people live FOR each other but with (and that can take many many forms- including long distance). \nI don\u2019t get great feelings about the grandmother.  She sounds terrified that she will lose her daughter, honestly\u2026 to the point that she is willing to sacrifice her granddaughter\u2026yikes.\nI would really like to know what Annie thinks and feels would be best. It sounds like more independence would be healthy, but maybe a cross country move and complete severing if ties might be traumatic and riddled with emotional pitfalls she might not be prepared to handle. \nWhat\u2019s wrong g with getting married and moving out closer to home?  Gradually changing the family dynamic, giving plenty of time to make proper adjustments etc and then moving west when better plans are in place?  Or at least making sure that home healthcare for MIL is set up before you go? \nI think you\u2019re a bull in a China shop and heedless of the damage you\u2019re about to unleash not only to the older women, but to Annie too.  \nYeah, YTA.", "No one deserves to control another person\u2019s life, for the entirety of their own life. And no one deserves to have to sacrifice their life for someone else\u2019s wellbeing. I hope Annie sticks to your plan. Regardless I\u2019d suggest counseling for Annie because she\u2019s been brainwashed by her GM and her own mother guilt trips and manipulates her to keep her glued to her side. That\u2019s not at all normal. She deserves independence and freedom for the first time in her life. But if mother or GM can F it up they certainly will try everything they can to ruin it for her.

Having a plan in place so Annie won\u2019t have to worry about her mom sounds like the best way to make a break with a clear conscience. \n\nAnnie is also going to need time to adjust, possibly rediscover who she is after literal years of being allowed virtually nothing of her own, and that\u2019s likely going to require professional assistance.

GMIL is a whole new level of evil emotional abuse.", "Regardless of whether you move across country or stay in the same town I think it is probably prudent to transition her mother into a care facility. You are right - Annie doesn't have to sacrifice the rest of her life to care for her mother.\n\nAnd, frankly, her grandmother is being emotionally manipulative. That needs to be shut down right away. This might be an unpopular opinion but there is an obligation we have to our parents which is compounded/made more difficult in that Annie's mother seems to be profoundly disabled. It isn't that Annie needs to sacrifice her life, nor does she need to remain the primary care-giver (and the thought of the necessity of someone filling that role in the future might also be preying on her grandmothers mind). But perhaps Annie needs to help with that transition into a care facility - that her presence in the initial stages might make it easier for her mother. And, while it may be difficult for her too, it might allow her to process and find some closure (not sure if that is the right word) knowing that she's done what she could. \n\nObviously I don't know know all the ins and out of the situation. I don't know what Annie wants. I don't know who has legal guardianship over her mother and who can make those care decisions. I know it can be incredibly complicated both emotionally and procedurally/legally - and that is all before starting to negotiate the care system. \n\nSo I am not saying Annie has to do those things - or that she will be AH if she doesn't. I think this is one of these situations that is going to be hard no matter what route is taken. At the end of the day only Annie and yourself are going to know what the \"right\" decision is for yourselves.", "I think probably the best thing is that you and Annie actively research and look for a good care facility rather than just leaving. It will probably help Annie with the guilt and help her move forward.

What about a social worker for adults with disabilities? Depending on what her needs are, your MIL could have care workers come to her home or they could help find a nice small group home or assisted living home for her. There are lots of options between home and hospital/nursing home, and some may give her more independence than she has now.\n\nI also think it's important for Annie to move out and have her own life. She'll need a lot of support. However, because of how much her family relies on her, it wasn't kind to MIL to plan on leaving suddenly. \n\nNTA, but do try to get services set up for your MIL.", "A person doesn't need to understand therapy to benefit from it. My young one didn't understand when they started various therapies, yet it helped improve their lives. When I was an older teen, I didn't really understand, yet throughout the process I benefited. My half-sister with downs syndrome doesn't understand, yet the therapies, even the group/play therapy alone, improved her life and well being tremendously.\n\nSadly it sounds like Gmil didn't invest in your girlfriend as a grandchild, but rather raised her to be the life long caregiver of her own child for once she passes or is incapable of being that herself.
