I really appreciate it.\n\nHi! I really need other people\u2019s perspective on this as I\u2019m struggling to see how my words could\u2019ve justified such a strong reaction from my MIL of several years. Also take note that English is not my first language.\n\nSo to start with; I like my MIL though we are very different. She\u2019s a sweet woman and a social butterfly but sensitive and have a tendency of being the victim. I\u2019m introverted but direct and set a lot of bounderies because of my lack of during childhood and also just anxiety. She isn\u2019t always respecting of them which has lead me to become even more stern and direct. I\u2019ll give an example; Leading up to my labor I let everyone on my side of the family know that the hospital doesn\u2019t allow family and friends and that I don\u2019t want visitors coming to our home before I invite them. I asked my partner to inform his side and he did. However my MIL bought a ticket to come see us after, completely disregarding my wish. My partner told her again that I\u2019m not ready for visitors (was battling PPD and recovering from an emergency c-sec). She went anyways, probably thinking we\u2019d change our minds. So of course we ended up having her over because my partner felt bad for her. It really hurt me because I felt I was less important, which has happened before. \n\nOkay, fast forward to this incident. She was coming back from holiday and on her way home wanted to visit us. We thought she was only staying the day but when I asked her she said she was going to be here for several days and would be staying with us. I was taken a back because we live in a small apartment with no spare bedrooms after we just transitioned our baby to her own room. I told her this and basically said she couldn\u2019t stay here. She suggested she slept in our bedroom with my partner (!), since I\u2019m sleeping with our baby atm. He then suggested he would sleep in the living room (but that would mean zero places for me to catch a break, I didn\u2019t say no but made it clear I didn\u2019t like the idea). Anyways, she said she would look for a hotel and I didn\u2019t think any more of it. A couple of hours later she got up and said she has to go. She had booked a ticket home. I practically begged her to stay but she left anyways, told me she was upset and refused to stay and talk it out. I messaged her after and apologized if I had hurt her and again asked her to come back. She replied she didn\u2019t want to talk. That\u2019s a week ago and she still isn\u2019t talking to me, only my partner. Told him he should\u2019ve stood up for her. He\u2019s also been super disappointed in me and upset because he thinks I\u2019m rude, barely talked for days. I\u2019m over here wondering wtf is going on! \n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1693418011, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/165lop1/aita_my_mil_is_angry_with_me_and_doesnt_want_to/", "score": 91, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are not TA but you need to stop apologizing to the people who are stepping all over you for their convenience.\n\nTake this period of silence from your MIL as a blessing.

Neither he or his mom respects you. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong and you have nothing to feel bad for.", "NTA, so I actually see this as a good outcome, it's a lesson for her. Hopefully, she can internalize what happened here and understand that while some may put up with her bad behavior, your family will not. The idea of her kicking you out of your bed is insane. \n\nWhen she is ready to talk to you or your partner, you guys should reiterate that you would love to have her come visit and see her granddaughter. However, all trips will be approved by you and your husband with the logistics worked out beforehand. I would try to sell it as a positive thing, where the family is communicating more and becoming more close in a bond of mutual respect. \n\nGood luck girl", "NTA. You keep holding your boundaries and stop apologizing for them. They're there for a reason -- because you need them, and your needs matter. Your husband needs to support you and have your back. He always should have, but he's a father now and you're a family of three; his mother, her moods and her opinions should not run the show in any way shape or form. You should tell him that YOU are disappointed in him, because he's the one failing here. You two should be a team, not working against each other.", "NTA\nI don't know where you're from, but for me, it's basic courtesy to not invite yourself over to a person's house and especially to: \n\nstay for several days  \nkick the homeowner out of their own bed  \n\n\nFamily or not.   \n\n\nMIL is entitled, nip that in the bud.

Why are you apologizing?  You are really setting yourself up for more of this crap.   \n Screw that.  You should be happy she caught a flight to go home.  Please get a backbone.

She is playing the guilt card to get you to back off your boundaries so MIL can do what she wants when she wants. MIL is the one who did wrong, but she has you apologizing and begging her to stay. \n\nLet her not talk to you - it\u2019s a power play. As long as you are begging her to talk to you, she has the power. If you stop, then she loses this power. Remember: you hold access to her grandchild, so you hold the greatest power of all.", "Pfft, NTA. This is just a simple guilt trip and it seems to be working. Asking for something isn't an AH move. I don't think she's an AH for asking if she could stop by to visit you all. But visitors don't get to dictate how long they stay at someone's house. They get to say \"I was thinking ::insert x days/time::\" and then either receive an ok or not and proceed from there. \n\nI'm not sure I understand your setup though. The sharing a bed with a parent whose visiting when another bed isn't available is actually not really a ! thing in my culture, but I don't see why it was necessary. This may be that I'm just confused in general about the set up though. You said you're sleeping with the baby right now. Does that mean there's an adult sized bed in the baby's room? Was that not an option for the MIL? And the sleeping was only going to be at night, yes? Was your partner supposed to be on the couch all day as well? Do you all live in a culture where visitors always get the \"best\" room (which is often the Master Bedroom) when they're visiting?\n\nI would recommend that next time, you accept their on-the-surface arguments as though they were real. If she says \"I've booked a ticket home\", you say \"oh, okay. Yeah, you're right, that probably is for the best as we're so tight on space right now. Well it was so nice to see you for this short time, but have a safe trip home! We'll see you at ::insert next time you'll probably see them::\"", "Info do you have any more examples of you being 'stern and direct with anxiety'", "ESH\n\nHer accommodations should have been clarified in advance, especially if it was untenable to host her. That is partially your fault for only having the conversation upon her arrival.\n\nI think MIL's passive aggressive behavior is immature -- that said, it's clear that she doesn't really feel welcomed by you and wanting to have boundaries is still not an excuse for alienating her all together.", "YTA. Surely a couple of days disruption isn\u2019t asking much of you or more than you can handle?  She\u2019s your husband\u2019s mother.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I want to and probably have to before we see them again!", "OP, you are not alienating anyone.  If anything, you are WAY too accommodating.  Your boundaries matter and your MIL trampled all over them. Your partner let her. There is absolutely no reason to try accommodating someone with so little regard for your feelings or well being.  I would go low contact with MIL until she's ready to respect you and your boundaries.  \n\nYour bigger problem, though, IMO is your husband. He should be protecting you and he's not. That's a huge problem.  This lack of support is not sustainable long-term.  There are numerous examples on Reddit alone of wives getting fed up with their husbands prioritizing their MIL over them, and finally leaving. That may or may not be your future, but just know this kind of dynamic puts enough stress on a marriage to lead to divorce.  If your husband is unable/unwilling to see the problem here, maybe you two would benefit from couples counselling.  \n\nIn any case, your MIL is an AH. Your partner is an AH. You are NTA."]}
