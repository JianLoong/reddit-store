I was visiting my sister last January when my niece saw it, she googled the brand and showed me how much it really was. I won't lie, I didn't wear it after that because I was afraid of ruining it.\n\nLast week, I wore it while visiting my sister. While I was putting it back on to leave, I felt something go *splat* on my back, then my niece started cackling and the smell of paint hit me. I was so pissed off while she was not apologitic at all. Her mom screamed at her and said she was grounded. Then she said she will pay for the dry cleaning.\n\nWhile I was in my car, still in shock BTW, I got an alert that my niece posted a reel, it was of her *doing a prank* on me, and she said \"I'm going to hit my aunt's $20k coat with a paint filled balloon to see how she reacts\". I saved it on my phone, sent it to her mom and told her that a week's grounding is not enough. She did not reply, but I saw that my niece took it down (it got less than 5 views by then).\n\nThe next day I found out my coat can not be saved, so I called my sister and told her that her daughter has to pay it back. Well, we got into an argument and she said that they will not be paying it, and if I wanted a new one, I should get my husband to buy it for me.

This is a really good way for your niece to learn that actions have consequences and hopefully will serve her well in the future, when she's older. And your sister seems to need that lesson too, sounds like. \"Just have your husband buy you a new one\" is NOT an appropriate reaction to your kid destroying a $20K item.", "NTA.  She ruined a $20k coat.  She wasn\u2019t even apologetic.", "Honestly NTA. Actions have consequences and you are right a weeks grounding isn\u2019t enough. She should sell her car and cough up the money. The niece is old enough to know better. Tell your sister either she comes up with the money or you take it to the cops. I wonder if a police report will force the insurance company to come up with the money. This wasn\u2019t an accident it was intentional and she won\u2019t do it again. This reminds of the idiots gluing themselves to paintings to fight climate change.", "Nope, NTA.  She knew precisely what she was doing, and deserves to now learn exquisite consequences of her horrid actions.\n\nI do have to ask, what makes a coat worth $20k?  Doesn\u2019t matter for judgement but I\u2019m morbidly curious\u2026", "NTA\n\nNiece is about to get some heavy consequences. I have no patience for teenagers who ruin other people's very expensive items for online cred. If she stole the coat - that's a felony. Selling her car to repay what she owes sounds about right.", "NTA.  Sue them.  \n\nI don't care if the coat was $10 or $10000.  I wish we'd bring back the stocks for pranksters.", "NTA - this is criminal damage - she knew the value of the coat, and she used paint which normally can't be removed.  Sometimes, people have to face the consequences of their actions - it's not about the coat, it's about personal responsibility, and 16 is way old enough to know better.  She did this out of jealousy, and I'm guessing your sister had something to do with that.\n\nThis girl owes you for the coat she ruined, and she should pay for it.", "NTA\nMore than the cost of the coat it was a gift from your MIL. Your niece knew the coat would be ruined and she did it for fun and disregarded your feelings all together. \nThose who would have to pay back the money will call you the AH and will probably go NC over this. But the solution from her to fix something so expensive is just let your husband buy a new one only punishes your husband and your niece gets away w this. \n\nNot only can you sue them you can press charges for criminal mischief or damage (whatever it\u2019s called in your state). That price will probably be a felony charge. Her being 16 she won\u2019t go to jail and it won\u2019t be on her record after turning 18. But if found guilty I\u2019m sure a judge will order restitution and they\u2019ll be bound by the court to repay you for damage. \nThis way you won\u2019t have to file in a small claims court and go through that process. \n\nIf you have her arrested it\u2019ll all be taken care of and she\u2019ll learn her lesson. \nShe can\u2019t just go around destroying other people\u2019s property & all she gets is a week being grounded.", "You are NTA\n\nYour niece and sister definitely are though.  Your sister more than your niece.  Her FIRST response should have been apologetic (sounds like it was) and her second response should have been that your niece (and parents) will replace the coat at full value! \n\nDo not back down or cave to family pressures. You are the injured party.  It was intentional and your niece was fully aware of the value of the coat.  \n\nWhat will she damage next to get attention. A car? A house? A person? This behavior is not acceptable.", "NTA\n\nPlay stupid games, win stupid prizes. In this case - a $20k debt.", "**NTA**. The title had me leaning towards you BTA but then I changed my mind when reading the rest. Your niece is entitled AF. She looked up how expensive the coat was, showed you how expensive it was, then decided to publicly ruin it for online clout. Absolute trash behavior. If I was her mother, I'd ask you to take her to court because she obviously needs some serious wrist slapping. \n\nRespectfully, fuck your niece.", "NTA!  What your niece did was malicious.  She was MORE than old enough to know better.  She needs to learn that her \"prank\" was both nasty and costly.  I would file a claim against them, for sure.  Throw paint on anything, and it's ruined.  They need to pay up.", "NTA and niece needs to learn that destroying people\u2019s things for internet clout is unacceptable. A week of grounding is not enough.", "When i was 16 i would have been scared to even breath near a 20k coat! Nta at all", "You're NTA. She knew the price of the coat and she ruined it deliberately for social media likes. Neither she nor her mother are accepting that she is responsible for what she did. That deserves the fullest wrath of consequences you can unleash.", "NTA, I'd do the same. It was a gift and your niece needs to learn the consequences of her actions.", "NTA niece is learning about reaping what you sow the hard way. She knew what she was doing, she should be held accountable for it", "Oh god, how awful. I\u2019m so sorry! NTA. Is there a way to get it appraised (based on what it looked like before)? If u go through with an attorney, they may want to see that. I like the idea of using your homeowners insurance. Is there a way they can turn around and sue your sister or her daughter? I\u2019m not sure how all of that works. Ugh.", "NTA. Niece is more than old enough to know better. You gave them a chance to simply just pay the cost of the coat they didn't so now your sister(because you can't sue minors) is gonna have to pay for your coat AND a lawyer. At 20K you can also press charges but I don't recommend it.\n\nYeah a 20K is kind of out there, but also? we're all allowed nice things.", "NTA. Apart from what you stated as your reasoning for court, this was something that does merit a hefty discipline. Selling the niece's car would be a perfect lesson. It's also not just the monetary value its also the sentimental value, the fact that your MIL technically said \"have it cuz you like it, and I appreciate you so much to give you something this expensive without a second thought\". You even felt bad about wearing it at all anywhere due to potentially ruining it, and this definetly was not what you were thinking could happen.", "The cost of the item is not relevant to the judgement: NTA. Your niece KNEW what she was doing AND CHOSE TO DO IT. The consequences need to fall on her and/or her parents/guardians. If they are not going to make it right of their own volition, take them to court. To prove a point, I would go through with it, get the court to award you the money, and if they pay, get the $20k in cash and donate it to a charity. Put that on social media and tag your niece so she can see how it\u2019s done by a grown up.", "I would file a police report for\nProperty damage. Sue their homeowners insurance and the parents. She did it was on purpose", "Definitely NTA. Since she is under 18 (I\u2019m assuming you are in the US), you will be suing your sister since she is responsible for your niece. \n\nShe is more than old enough to understand actions have consequences.", "NTA. That she did it for clout is appalling; that your sister thinks grounding her for one week is somehow appropriate or sufficient is more appalling. She should have to sell her car and pay you back. That seems fitting with her crime and is a good lesson for her to learn before she reaches legal adulthood and does something more stupid that will have adult consequences that she won\u2019t be able to avoid.", "NTA \n\nI wouldn\u2019t even be hesitating. Your sister is teaching her kid that she can do whatever she wants and get away with it. $20k down the drain and she\u2019s in trouble for a week? That\u2019s it? That\u2019s her punishment? Oh hell no. TO COURT.", "NTA! My mother would have made me sell my car for sure if it was done on purpose to pay for a new one! Not that it would even cover a 20k coat haha but she\u2019d make sure I paid up what I could and worked until it was paid back in full.", "NTA. It's a stupidly expensive coat from people with more money than sense but it was still a gift and she still destroyed it purposefully for an incredibly stupid reason. I wouldn't expect or want her to repay all of it, but I'd certainly expect her to get a part time job and send you virtually all the pay from it till at least she left her parent's place for college or whatever bare minimum. A week being grounded is nothing.", "OH MY GOODNESS!!\n\nLet's sum up the only relevant data:\n* She deprived you of $20,000 worth of goods\n* It was not accidental\n* There is irrefutable evidence\n* There is a recorded confession of intent\n* If reported to police, the incident would likely be deemed a crime\n* The person and the person's guardians refuse to discuss a reasonable repayment plan\n\nNTA. Personally, I'd be considering reporting a crime. \n\nI'm sure I'd regret it, but man I'd want to.", "Nta", "NTA. I would be so livid if my child did that.", "NTA. I would sue & block your sister and any family giving you grief, this will save you down the line when they want to \"borrow\" money from you.", "You need to sue and give us an update", "NTA...  A week being grounded, whatever that entails, for destroying $20K in property... no wonder your niece is a little monster.  She needs to learn about consequences.  Your sister raised her to be a brat and she needs to start holding your niece accountable for her poor behavior.  $20K is a lot of money, even for upper middle class, but she didn't even try to make it right with you.", "NTA\n\nShe knew **exactly** what she was doing as evidenced by her **video title.**\n\nShe fucked around and now it's time to find out.\n\nStop threatening and file suit.", "NTA\n\nWhile yes, there should be restitution I do have a question.\n\nWho has a 20k dollar coat that isn't insured?", "Nta! Niece is a jerk", "What a brat! NTA. Stand your ground and don't back down.", "NTA /she\u2019s 16 she knows better", "NTA. Take them to court. That\u2019s $20k in damaged property. You have the evidence, and they don\u2019t even seem apologetic for it. Time for real world consequences! She\u2019s old enough to know better.", "NTA! \nHas she gotten away with acting like this all her life?! Who thinks \u201c let me ruin my aunts 20k coat just for fun!\u201d Like WTF! Just makes me think she\u2019s never faced any consequences for her actions. Definitely take her to court, has she even apologized?!", "NTA all the way. Actually sue. And please keep us updated. This is a perfect life lesson chance to teach her that actions have consequences, even when done to family. If your sister and her husband don't like it, too fucking bad. Should've taught your daughter that vandalism is wrong, and destroying anything is bad, especially on purpose. And even more so when that thing is worth 20 thousand dollars.", "NTA\n\nShe knew the cost and knew it was a gift. She wouldn't have been giggling if someone did that to her car. Sue for full amount and mental damage because you can't trust her anymore or your sister with the fact of actually being on your side", "NTA - you kinda have to sue at this point.  \nYour sister isnt raising her kid right, and if she goes unpunished she will do it again and again.", "NTA sue them and update us on the drama.", "NTA. Yep, your sister should sell the niece's car so as to pay you back. If she doesn't, she's just reinforcing bad behaviour. Take 'em to court if you have to, no one has the right to ruin your belongings. I'd have a bit more sympathy towards the niece if the niece didn't know how much the coat was worth, but that's not the case. What a crappy thing for her to do.", "Take her to court...AFTER FILING A POLICE  REPORT..that much in damage is a felony.", "NTA. You should definitely have a heart to heart with your sister and let her know you\u2019d like to get her homeowners insurance involved. A court case should be the absolute last resort", "NTA. If she smashed your new $20k car with a baseball bat for a video would that be ok??\u2026 \n\nHowever I do think this will likely ruin your relationship with your sister unfortunately. But if she doesn\u2019t learn a lesson from this she will always be like this.", "NTA. Your niece is probably a minor so you would have to sue her parents, and you are only entitled to the fair market value of the coat, not the replacement cost. It may be hard to convince a Judge it's worth 20k just because some store has it on sale for 20k. Also, it's probably over the small claims limit, so you would need a lawyer. Also, even if you win, there is no guarantee you would collect or it would be easy to collect. Finally, you will almost certain destroy your relationship with them for the rest of your life if you sue them.", "NTA. Actions have consequences. Go to court baby. It\u2019s time she learned this lesson because her mom obviously isn\u2019t teaching it to her.", "[deleted]", "Your niece really needs to learn a lesson, but please consider whether you are truly willing to completely ruin your relation with your sister - and possibly, with other members of your family - over that? Because that will be the consequence of *your* action.\n\nPerhaps a better althernative is to consider the coat a goner, and to sit down with your sister and discuss an appropriate punishment for your niece that you can both agree on.", "I can\u2019t even tell you how fake this sounds, but if it\u2019s real, then NTA.\n\nRemind your sister that this kind of thing may be covered by her homeowner\u2019s insurance policy.  That is likely the only way you\u2019ll collect anything.  Regardless, get this before the court as soon as possible.", "NTA Sue her. Stupid people; stupid prizes, etc.", "[removed]", "I kbow this isnt a popular opinion but ESH. I mean It sucks that it can't be saved even your sister tried to right the wrong, but taking said niece to court over a coat seems so petty. Like, do you honestly believe your niece, a 16 year old child, can foot a 20k bill? Are you willing to put your sister in debt because of childish action of a child? Imo it doesn't seem worth it", "ESH, your niece is an ass for what she did.  Her parents are asses for not trying to make this right and actually discipline her properly for this.  However, you're also an ass for wiping out their savings to pay for a gift that had limited utility or sentimental value to you simply because she made the mistake of messing with rich people stuff.  \n\n\nWhat you're doing now will only force a schism in your family.  You will almost certainly fail to actually recover the full value of the coat or teach your niece anything because her parents are bearing the stress.  So if possible maybe try to reach out to your in-laws and see if you can compromise by having them require your niece get a job and pay you back 3k within this the 12 months.  \n\n\nThis will suck for her.  She'll be forced to work for a paycheck that she never sees for weeks on end after her normal school responsibilities.  It will displace time with sports and friends.  It will be a real punishment.  \n\n\nNow maybe her parents won't be okay with something like this.  Maybe you do want their money and that matters more to you than anything else.
