It was a nasty fight.\n\nRaymond is from a different country (initially), and a different culture. We met when both living in Southern California, but he eventually followed me and moved here (Midwest America) to be with me. After 3 years of being here, he decided it wasn\u2019t for him and he wants to move to the country where he was born. We are deeply in love and best friends, and we don\u2019t want to physically be separated. Nor do I want him to stay where he is unhappy. In that moment, we thought our only solution was divorce.

I hope OP realises this!", "In fairness to OP's sister, that comment thread is the same one she admits they got into a fight that escalated to both of them breaking things and near divorce only a few weeks ago.", "Have you considered the possibility she has tried but is having trouble putting the way she's feeling into words? \"Bad vibes\" can go both ways. Sometimes it is a way of avoiding an actual explanation. But it can also mean \"I feel worried but can't articulate why\".", "There's a few options here. \n\nPainting your sister in the most positive light, she knows there's no way to convince you because she's already tried. \n\nIn the most negative light, her initial Bad Vibes were founded on racism and imagined problems rather than reality so she didn't actually have a foot to stand on and now that she very much does she doesn't want to go back and explain her earlier behavior. \n\nMost likely it's somewhere more in the middle and your sister isn't particularly nice (her tactics towards you and Raymond were, to be clear, not only cruel but the exact opposite way to handle anything if you were being abused) BUT her complaints about Raymond are also not unfounded.\n\nI do think it's a little worrisome to go from a fight escalating to violence to moving to a different country with him in the span of a few weeks. If you do decide to go through with this move I would be very, very sure that you can get around by yourself, preferably being fairly fluent in the language spoken if it's not yours. Your own bank account. Ideally a job secured before you move.\n\nBreaking stuff (from both of you) is a very bad sign and needs to be resolved on a different level than \"well we fixed the argument by me saying I'd do what he wanted\". That does nothing to fix the underlying reasons it escalated as far as it did."]}
