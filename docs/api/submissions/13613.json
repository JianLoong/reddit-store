Cannot fathom how she wanted you as MOH but won't invite your husband.", "NAH. Let's be honest, you've made some moves that worsened this situation, and the biggest one is this: You've told your family about disagreements you've had with your husband. Your family loves you, and so they will naturally be upset on your behalf. However, once you and your husband make up a few days later, your family won't be a part of that process. They'll still be upset at your husband. It sounds like your little sister is feeling this emotion more than the rest of your family.\n\n\nAnd it sounds like there might be reasons for this.\n\n\nThe information\u00a0you revealed about Raymond in the comments should have been in the original post. He's ten years older than you. He's trying to get you to move away from your family with him to his home country of Mexico (not exactly the safest place). The two of you get into arguments so intense that you break each other's possessions. It's not surprising that your family doesn't like him. Helping you in the gym does not make up for this in their eyes.\n\nIf you move to Mexico, you may not have the protections afforded to you in the US. This move has a big chance of not making your marriage better. He may be happier there, but if you aren't happier there, then your marriage will still suffer. If his anger worsens in the future, will the authorities protect you from him? If you decide to divorce, will the courts be as favorable to you as the courts in the US?\n\n\nRaymond is your husband, and you love him. You want your family to accept him. Your family loves you, wants you close, and wants you safe. There are no assholes in this situation. However, because you have confided in your family about your disagreements with Raymond, they are unlikely to view him favorably. The 10-year age gap was probably already a red flag for them. Now it's worse.\n\nYour best move here is to build bridges by being your sister's maid of honor. Tell her you love her and want to be there for her. Ask her, as a favor to you, to understand that you and Raymond are still processing your relationship, but that you love him and would appreciate it if she could accept Raymond for as long as you do. (If he's ACTUALLY abusing you, she will be unable to accept this request, and rightfully so.)", "NTA. Don't let anyone pressure you to take her abuse anymore.

Yes, part of his \u201cemotional outburst\u201d was a reaction to being fed up with my family and me \u201cdoor-matting\u201d myself. He and I want to maintain a relationship with my parents. Raymond has formed a wonderful bond with them over the years, believe it or not. No one can control my 32-year-old sister\u2019s behavior. She lives with my parents, so she is always there. \n\nAnd yes, he would have never smashed the laptop had I not smashed his toy.", "You\u2019re right. And to clarify\u2014 the kicker is my parents have never even had Covid.", "Okay, you offer good advice, but you got some things wrong.\n\nYes, it was my fault for involving my parents in our fight. My fault, big time. My parents have since understood that both Raymond and I played equal parts in it, and that he is family and sometimes shit happens. First time something like that happened.\n\nMy parents have a good relationship with Raymond. It\u2019s been very difficult with my sister, but thankfully we\u2019ve managed to involve my parents in our life in a positive way.\n\nTen year age gap is nothing.\n\nWhat you mention about Mexico is valid.\n\nI want to be a part of my sister\u2019s wedding. But not like this. This has been going on for far too long with too many unresolved issues for me to just accept her behavior. It\u2019s impossible to mend a situation with someone who refuses to meet you halfway. She does not discuss what\u2019s truly on her mind with me.
