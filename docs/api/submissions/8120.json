Katie is diagnosed with ADHD and Impulse Control Disorder. I understand that makes things difficult for her, but on average her behaviour is just due to permissive parenting and lack of consequences.\r\nRecently I took Katie, my daughter (9), our brother\u2019s daughters (7,5) for a movie. Katie was an absolute nightmare, she kept running off in a busy mall, when I had other kids to mind, she didn\u2019t want to wait in line and kept whinging about it, but the last straw was when she  threw her drink at another girl who had on the same tracksuit set as her.\r\n I was so angry, I called my eldest (17) who was in the mall already, and had her watch the movie with the others, then carried Katie off  screaming and kicking, and took her home.\r\n On the way home she cried that she can\u2019t help it, her brain makes her do things like that. I took her home and sent her straight to bed and didn\u2019t allow her the popcorn we had already bought. \r\nMy sister picked her up the next day, and sister was back within an hour, screaming about how I maltreated and  just about abused her daughter with what I did, how Katie couldn\u2019t help it, and all the excuses. \r\nThe following days, Katie\u2019s father and his family also bombarded me with messages  calling all sorts of names. \r\nOur family is on my side as we all believe my sister is too permissive and lets Katie run their home. \r\nBut my brother in law told me I should feel proud, now I broke a little girl\u2019s confidence, she feels like she can\u2019t function in public and refuses to leave the house.  My daughter had her birthday a few days back and Katie didn\u2019t come. She and my daughter are best friends and my daughter begged her, but she told my daughter that \u2018My brain will probably go crazy again and make me do bad stuff and upset your mom, so I will stay home\u2019. \r\nSeeing that message honestly stung, because I never meant for my niece to think she cannot function in public, and now I\u2019m wondering if I was maybe too harsh on her.", "created_utc": 1674528570, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10jv7w6/aita_for_taking_my_niece_home_after_she_threw_her/", "score": 48, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your sis and BIL are doing Katie and everyone else a huge disservice and they may be AHs or they may not know what the hell they're doing, but they are the most to blame. \n\nKatie isn't just making up this line out of nowhere. It's what she's been told. That her brain is crazy and she can't help it. Someone is telling her that her impulses are not her fault and therefore her behaviour isn't either. \n\nBut she obviously feels bad too knowing that she has upset you and is avoiding doing it again, which makes me empathetic to her because she's 9 and has no idea how to deal with this ish herself. \n\nYou did perfectly right in removing her and applying consequences, which were not cruel or excessive. \n\nHer parents are failing her in not applying consequences nor seemingly giving her treatment or the conceptual tools to understand that while it is harder for her than others, she still needs to work on controlling her impulses. \n\nEither they have ignored the advice of the diagnosing professional in favour of running with 'anything she does is not her fault' - in which case they are of course AHs and failing their daughter horribly - or the professional has given them terrible advice, in which case they have been failed by the pro. \n\nBut I'm inclined to think it's on them.\n\nEither way, NTA.", "NTA what could you do? She committed assault on another member of the public.", "NTA. Her parents aren't doing any parenting whatsoever. While it is true that those disorders may impact her ability to control herself, it is not impossible. Her parents are letting that child walk all over them. By not helping her, they are hurting her because this type of behavior will have the potential for increasingly serious consequences as she gets older.", "If she can't refrain from throwing a drink on another child, she really can't function in public.", "NTA. Katie may be a high-needs child, but she is not allowed to assault people. A diagnosis is a reason, not an excuse. \n\nYou couldn't ensure the safety of the other movie patrons while Katie was at the movies. You behaved responsibly when you removed her from the situation where she was harming others.", "NTA .. and I'm sorry to say she is not functioning in public if she is throwing drinks at people because they have on the same outfit.", "NTA.\n\nI feel for Katie's inability to control her impulses, but you can't allow her to run off unattended and assault others. You were right to take her home. she was a risk to herself and the people she was assaulting.\n\nSending her straight to bed and denying her a snack may or may not have been the right corrective action, but it is far from abusive.", "NTA \n\nHer parents have instilled that she has no control over her brain, instead of coming up with strategies with her in regards to impulse control.  My 6 year old niece has issues with impulse control and she was able to use a certain word to alert when she feels a certain way where she cant control herself (they came up with their own word for the impulse), and hearing that word would alert her teacher or parents or family members to know that she needs to be taken out of the situation.  \n\n\nParents who coddle, make excuses, and don't properly treat their kids mental health issues, are negligent parents.  She is going to live the rest of her life thinking that anything she does that is bad, cruel  or illegal is because she has no control over it, when the real reason is that her parents don't want to put in the work and deal with her reactions, so it's better to make her feel like a victim and get away with that.  ADHD and Impulse disorders can be treated, and people can have good lives, but if their parents refuse to have them treated, they are setting her up for failure. \n\n\nThey want to make you feel bad so you apologize.  They want you to be sorry so your sister and BIL feel better about themselves.\n\nI'd send a kind text that says:  You are teaching your daughter that she has no control over her own behavior, instead of getting her the help she needs to be able to control her behavior.  She wasn't in an accident that resulted in brain damage, she has diagnosises that are treatable if the parents and the child work at it.  What happens if she Assaults someone or seriously injures another child?  Are you going to tell the courts that she can't help it?  Are you going to tell the kids parents not to sue you for medical bills because it isn't her fault she can't control herself?  At this rate since she is a child, right now this is your fault, and it will continue to be until she gets the treatment and parental support she needs", "NTA.  She threw a drink on another kiddo.  That\u2019s punishable behavior and she needs to learn that\u2019s not okay.  I\u2019m sure she\u2019s embarrassed, but it hopefully taught her a lesson.", "NTA\n\nKatie's problems mean she is going to struggle learning how to control her impulses. She may never be as good at it as a neurotypical person. But that doesn't mean she can't learn any control. Her parents are doing her a disservice by not discipling her at all. \n\nFrankly, I don't think there's much you can do. Unless Katie's parents start getting her help, she won't change. And it sounds like they've told Katie she literally can never control her behavior, so she believes it too. \n\nIf it were me, I would want to sit down with Katie and have a talk about how even though she can't control her disorder now, she might be able to one day with proper intervention. And that you punished her because you want to help her one day get more control. Maybe show her an educational YouTube video that's simple enough for kids to understand about how to manage these disorders. But, of course, this is going against what the parents have decided is best (which is not trying), so it could backfire on you there....", "NTA- You did the right thing, her parents need to stop making excuses and step the fuck up. She assaulted someone, if she can't behave in public then she can't go in public. She needs to be in therapy and on medication and until then she should be limited to being to public spaces because if the police were to get involved then what? You did the right thing, your sister and BIL are AH and need to get their shit together. She believes what her parents tell her and will grow up using that as an excuse for what will very well end up as even worse behavior and the law won't give a damn. Actions, especially ones involving assault have consequences and Katie needs to learn that now, diagnosis or not. Taking the popcorn I see could be kinda cruel but it could also be you did a bad thing so you see no rewards, as it could be seen as a form of reward since she still got a treat.", "I mean. She threw a drink at a stranger, she's NOT functioning appropriately in public.

You could have handled some things a bit differently though.", "You need to do some more research on ADHD. All the behaviors you have described as classic ADHD traits. Excluding throwing the drink none of the behaviors are bad. She just struggles to be content without some sort of stimulus. She will learn coping strategies as she gets older, but it's a lot to expect a kid her age to manage. Some tricks you can try are providing stimulus so she doesn't get bored and run off e.g. a game or music.\n\nHaving ADHD can be hard especially if you are too young to fully understand what is going on.\n\nFrom her behavior it sounds like she is unmedicated so her parents are AH for not getting her medication.", "NTA\n\nEven if you have impulse control there should still be natural consequences for behavior.\n\nTaking her home is natural.\nNo popcorn was not necessary.", "NTA \n\nIt sounds like you\u2019ve done the right thing.

I have Impulse Control Disorder, with a specific compulsion to push people down the stairs.

You are dismissing a struggling child as just 'permissive parenting'. Yes, taking her out of the situation was good, but was the extra punishment necessary?", "Probably going to get downvoteed, but ESH, although you less than your niece, sister or brother-in-law. So I was with you for the removing her from the mall, she needed to be taken out of there,  she was acting up in a way that was just not acceptable. However, this was also a bit of a teachable moment. You should have explained to her that her actions have consequences, and the consequences are missing the movie with everybody else, but then let her down later to see everyone and have some of the popcorn provided that she behaved the rest of the night.\n\nUnfortunately, what she got out of this is that she's bad, and that the only acceptable solution is to be isolated from everyone else. I understand you are frustrated, I can't even blame you, but This was a real missed opportunity. She needs opportunities to show good behavior in controlled environments, and have that positive behavior reinforced.\n\nFor the record, none of this excuses her parents letting her run wild. They need to have her in some sort of behavioral therapy, and setting boundaries that they're going to make her adhere to. They don't do it because it's easier for them to let her run wild.", "YTA. Not for taking her out of there, but for punishing her like that by sending her to bed First off, ICD is real and does have extreme behavioral traits, so it goes beyond her being a brat or spoiled. Therapy and medication are very important to treatment. Punishment is not effective in regulating the disorder, same as with any disorder.\n\n But the harsh truth is that She can\u2019t control herself in public, and her parents are ignoring her. Pyromania is sometimes associated with his disorder. if she were going around setting things on fires, you sure as hell couldn\u2019t ignore it. You were not wrong for pulling her out of there. I only hope that she gets better with treatment and time, but you would do well to apologize for sending her to bed. It\u2019s not easy dealing with disorders, but its harder to have them. She\u2019s a child, it\u2019s going to take time to learn how to manage her behaviors effectively. This will be a difficult process for everyone. Remember compassion.", "NTA your niece is a nightmare because her parents let her get away with it. This is called a spoilt brat, it doesn't need a medical diagnosis.", "Info: so on the one hand you said this girl has been diagnosed with ADHD and Impulse Control Disorder, but on the other hand you said her behavior is \"just due to permissive parenting.\" How do you know that? Do you know what efforts her parents are making to manage her conditions?", "YTA.\n\nBut not really.\n\nI fully believe there are parents out there that do not parent and then go along with teacher recommended checks for behavioral difficulties that will put the kid on meds. This happens. Is your niece one of these? Let\u2019s pretend she is. Let\u2019s pretend the experts have found a diagnosis that is at least partially incorrect.\n\nThe kid saying, \u201cmy brain makes me\u201d supports the idea that adults have jumped from helping her understand possible problems to feeding into them.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter. The adults that around her fully believe the diagnosis. 99 percent of her week is filled with people that fully believe the situation. Your help is unwelcome. If your sister believes she should be able to throw drinks on kids without repercussion, you are not going to change that behavioral flaw in the one night you have her. \n\nYou\u2019re not going to fix this kid.

I suggest an alternate way to spend time with family.\n\nI think (you\u2019d have to ask them) that people that deal with special needs kid would probably tell you that enabling them to behavior they are prone to is not optimal.\n\nSo it\u2019d be excellent if this kid was yours and you accomplished some parenting with her.

You won\u2019t ever be anything but TA to your sis and parents even though I believe it\u2019s likely you are correct. \n\nAny kind of parenting you accomplish with other people\u2019s kids has to fall in the wider limits of what they might do.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It sounds like therapy for the entire family is necessary based upon just this one outburst and actions she's exhibiting, but you really need to make sure that yours is protected and Katie isn't inflicting any harm onto yours.", "You don't want that around your child. Eventually, your child will make a new best friend. NTA", "YTA. She is a 9 year old girl coping with some major mental conditions.  \n\nLooking through this thread and seeing some of your replies, you do not strike me as someone who is particularly understanding of those with special needs. The language you use and the way you talk betray an unpleasantly ableist sensibility. \n\nYou say her parents aren't making an effort, but then go on to explain that what you mean is you perceive no reprimands or consequences, neither of which are effective treatments for her condition. Seems to me that what you mean is that her parents do not punish her for her conditions the way you would. \n\nMaybe her parents aren't providing her with the help she needs, I can't say. What she needs is behavioural therapy and possibly medication if her doctor advises it. If her parents aren't providing that, then maybe they are neglecting her treatment. \n\nNot punishing her to your satisfaction though doesn't really paint them as being uninvolved or permissive. The fact that they both tore a strip off of you after they found out what you did suggests to me that they are clearly engaged with her, and that she feels safe enough with them to talk to them.\n\nAt the end of the day though, you gave a 9 year old girl an unreasonable punishment for something you knew perfectly well she couldn't control. As a result, she's now has anxiety and shattered self esteem, bestowed upon her by a family member who was supposed to love and protect her. You did that. To a 9 year old girl.

But I would not have sent her to bed early. I probably would allow the popcorn if she seemed remorseful and participated in the conversation of why it\u2019s inappropriate and discussed better ways to handle it with me. You Suck For That.
