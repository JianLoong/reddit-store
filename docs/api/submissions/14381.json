He lived a very long and happy life (he was 98 years old!) so rather than having a mournful funeral, my parents wanted the event to be more of a celebration of grandpa's life.\n\nI (24M) was at my parents\u2019 house for the weekend, in order to attend our grandfather\u2019s funeral. I and my parents were all ready and waiting for my 14-year old sister, Christina (we usually just call her \u201cChris\u201d) to hurry up. Chris used to be a sweet person, but nowadays she fancies herself a cool rebel. In reality, she\u2019s a bit of a brat.\n\nChris came downstairs, and her hair was unacceptably messy. Actually, her hair is always long and messy. However, our mother and grandmother insist that her untidy hair makes her look \u201ccute\u201d and so Chris just keeps it this way.\n\nI know it sounds weird, but I felt like the least my little sister could do was to straighten her hair out and look more formal and respectful. I wasn\u2019t in the mood to deal with her usual bullshit that day, so I bluntly told her to tidy up her hair or don\u2019t come to the funeral. My sister responded by swearing at me, and I got into a short, but vicious verbal fight with her. In the end, Chris was crying and she was furious at me, as were both of my parents. We all arrived at the funeral somewhat late, and Christina was the only one in our family who was crying during the funeral.\n\nETA: Some people here suggest that Chris's hair is naturally curly. But that's not the case. It's naturally plain and straight. But the way my sister does things, her hair is just kind of all over the place, like a rock musician kinda look. IMO, NOT an appropriate aesthetic for a funeral.", "created_utc": 1681055418, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12gn215/aita_for_telling_my_younger_sister_to_either_tidy/", "score": 343, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
