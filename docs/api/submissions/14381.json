He lived a very long and happy life (he was 98 years old!) so rather than having a mournful funeral, my parents wanted the event to be more of a celebration of grandpa's life.\n\nI (24M) was at my parents\u2019 house for the weekend, in order to attend our grandfather\u2019s funeral. I and my parents were all ready and waiting for my 14-year old sister, Christina (we usually just call her \u201cChris\u201d) to hurry up. Chris used to be a sweet person, but nowadays she fancies herself a cool rebel. In reality, she\u2019s a bit of a brat.\n\nChris came downstairs, and her hair was unacceptably messy. Actually, her hair is always long and messy. However, our mother and grandmother insist that her untidy hair makes her look \u201ccute\u201d and so Chris just keeps it this way.\n\nI know it sounds weird, but I felt like the least my little sister could do was to straighten her hair out and look more formal and respectful. I wasn\u2019t in the mood to deal with her usual bullshit that day, so I bluntly told her to tidy up her hair or don\u2019t come to the funeral. My sister responded by swearing at me, and I got into a short, but vicious verbal fight with her. In the end, Chris was crying and she was furious at me, as were both of my parents. We all arrived at the funeral somewhat late, and Christina was the only one in our family who was crying during the funeral.\n\nETA: Some people here suggest that Chris's hair is naturally curly. But that's not the case. It's naturally plain and straight. But the way my sister does things, her hair is just kind of all over the place, like a rock musician kinda look. IMO, NOT an appropriate aesthetic for a funeral.", "created_utc": 1681055418, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12gn215/aita_for_telling_my_younger_sister_to_either_tidy/", "score": 50, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Threatening to not allow someone to grieve the dead because of *your* standards that no one else gives a fuck about is.", "YTA. Who even are you to determine if she gets to go or not? You\u2019re her brother not her dad. You sound insufferable and should shut up and mind your own damn business", "YTA Who do you think you are? One of your parents was about to attend their own parent\u2019s funeral and this is how you support them? You don\u2019t get to decide whether someone of equal status in relation to your grandfather gets to go to his funeral or not. You behaved like an abusive bully and were absolutely out of order. If anyone should have had to stay away from the funeral, after your behaviour, it should have been you. But no-one sunk as low as to tell you that you could not attend, despite how horrible you were and the upset you caused your sister and your parents. You are supposed to be a **grown man**, your sister is still a **child**. Whatever your problem is, it\u2019s not your sister\u2019s hair. Your behaviour is not that of a well adjusted adult. It might be an idea to get some help for your anger issues before you abuse the wrong person and get yourself in trouble.", "Info: what did grandpa think of her hair? Did he have a problem with it being messy all the time?", "Yeah, you're an insufferable asshole. It's not your place to police your sister's appearance.

You focus on yourself and mind your own business.", "NTA- be presentable when appearing in public", "ESH\n\nYeah she should tidy herself up out of respect, but it\u2019s not AT ALL your place to insist on it.", "I\u2019m going to go ahead and say NTA. Maybe you could have went about it a bit more gently but I agree with you that people should at least try to look formal and respectful for a funeral", "Some people here suggest that Chris's hair is naturally curly. But that's not the case. It's naturally plain and straight. But the way my sister does things, her hair is just kind of all over the place, like a rock musician kinda look. IMO, NOT an appropriate aesthetic for a funeral.", "Well it\u2019s not a funeral, is it? It\u2019s a celebration.", "YTA you are not her mother and it is none of your business. You need to figure out what kind of relationship you want to have with people and then ask yourself this very important question am I a decent human being or am I not? To be honest how dare you?", "YTA. It's not your place to decide what's appropriate for your sister's hair to look like any day of the week, let alone a funeral. As long as she didn't have a battery operated light feature sticking out of a florescent fuchsia mohawk saying gramps's in a box, a messy ponytail or whatever it was wasn't going to take away from the solemnity of the occasion.", "so, let me get this straight, your grandmother (possibly your dead grandfather's wife?) finds her hair cute and fine for a teenage girl, but you, a young adult presumably with his own life, can't allow to be herself at a 'celebration of life'?

No. Then stay the Hell out of it.", "yta and a shit brother.", "YTA mind your own business and stop speaking so insulting and negatively about your kid sister. \n\nDo you even like her because this post is so full of venom towards the child?", "YTA.

I seriously doubt this AH behavior is limited to this particular situation.", "Why are OP's feelings and point of view more important than anyone else? Where does he get off imposing what he thinks is right on other people.\n\nSo much of what he wrote shows he is an AH.\n\nThe funeral was supposed to be a celebration of his life, parents and grandmother like this cute look. Probably the grandfather liked it too. I sense a lot of jealousy from OP.\n\nChris hadn't even spoken to OP but apparently he views her as dealing out bullshit already. OP needed to chill the fuck out. He was taking out his grieving for his grandfather on his sister.\n\nAnd to top it off, imagine crying at a funeral ... I mean who does that. It brings shame to the family to cry at a funeral /s", "This argument also made the whole family late to their grandfather\u2019s funeral. I would argue that causing the family to be late to the funeral because of this is actually more disrespectful to his memory than a hair style.", "Honestly he\u2019s the mega asshole. You\u2019re (OP) 24 mate not 64. Take a vacation from the power trip.", "W comment", "Yeah that statement about her being a brat rubbed me the wrong way. As someone who had their teenage angst phase a few years back, I\u2019d say Chris probably has it hard enough without being judged for her messy hair while still grieving a lost relative. \n\nKids and teens can be awful sometimes, yeah, but at least in this post it doesn\u2019t seem like Chris has done anything wrong. Sure, maybe her hairstyle is a bit informal, but it\u2019s not OP\u2019s place to tell her not to come to the funeral.", "Yeah, Chris deserves an apology. \n\n> \u201c\u2026rather than having a mournful funeral\u2026 we would have a celebration of grandpa\u2019s life.\u201d\n\nSo it wasn\u2019t even that formal & you decided to scrutinize your mourning sister.\n \n> \u201cI wasn\u2019t in the mood to deal with her usual bullshit that day\u201d\n\nAka you took some of your grief out on her.\n\nYTA", "If she was going to show up in a clown costume it might be a different story, but I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s so scandalous about her having messy hair.

OP has no business telling her how to dress or do her hair.", "He also mentioned the grandmother thought it was cute.  If she is the widow and had no issues, that holds even greater weight for it not being a problem.", "I agree.  You don\u2019t parent other people\u2019s children!  Your mom and dad know which battles to pick with their own daughter and they choose not to pick this one. \n\nI hated some of the hair styles my teenaged sons would wear sometimes.  But it was their hair and they were good kids, so I kept my mouth shut.  Even if they were \u201cbad\u201d kids, hair is not a battle worth fighting.  I saved my arguments for more important things like safety issues or keeping clean or something.\n\nAnd, your teenaged years are the times you\u2019re allowed to have bad hairstyles.

Her hair is fine.", "It wasn't messy enough for either of her parents, one of which is the child of the deceased, to complain about... So where does he have the absolute nerve to cause a scene trying to keep her from saying her farewells like that?

YTA.", "you can have that opinion all day but YTA for not keeping it to yourself and starting a spat right before the funeral over something so trivial.

You are the asshole.", "Looking dishevelled is fairly normal for a funeral. It's a *funeral*. No makeup and sobbing your eyes out is considered respectful.

Her parents were fine with it and Chris is fine with it and that is what matters.", "So did you stand out front of the funeral so you could approve or deny entry to everyone else based on how they appeared? \n\nDid your grandpa specifically tell you to please make sure everyone combed their hair to your liking for his funeral?", "Two people as far as I can see...

There is no such thing as an appropriate or inappropriate hairstyle for literally anything.\n\nIf you\u2019re clean, you\u2019re good to go. \n\nI\u2019m SO curious to see how you style your hair tho.
