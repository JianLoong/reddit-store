So she was sitting in the hall for a good hour before she knocked on my door and asked to use my bathroom\n\nI have never spoken to him or her before in my life so I would consider them strangers in that sense. I did let her use the bathroom but my circumstance was very different\n\nFor one, it was MY apartment. You being in your parents' home doesn't have the same connotation, it's not exactly *your* property at risk. Plus, for you, the husband was there. I have heard enough news in my Canadian home alone about women who (for some fucked up reason) work with men to traffic other women is real. Would he want to come in, too? Lastly, my apartment is small enough I can see the bathroom and front door from where I am in the living room, it wouldn't have been that easy for her to go through my stuff (I don't keep medication in my bathroom anyway)\n\nAll in all, if what you said in the comments is true and there's a McDonald's right there, I also wouldn't let someone in to use mine", "NTA they were probably going to rob you", "NTA, that\u2019s like the first scene in a horror movie where everyone is screaming \u201cWTF, would she let them in\u201d", "Oh good lord.

There's any number of medical reasons someone can be caught short, ranging simply from poor bladder control to digestive disorders, and not forgetting pregnancy.

I am not an evil person, and if I really had to go, to the point I would knock on the door of a stranger and ask, it means I REALLY have to go. But no, I would not let a stranger in my house.

Thankfully she wasn\u2019t physically harmed.", "NTA. Sounds like it could've been a scam. This is why I don't answer the door. I ask who it is, and if I don't know I say \"Sorry\" or \"No thanks\" and walk away.", "NTA, I would not trust anyone as in a stranger to go into my home to use my bathroom.

Do you really have to come here to ask if YTA for this?", "NTA. This was some kind of scam. Nobody does that.", "NTA. That's a great way to get murdered or robbed or both. Do not let strangers inside your home. \n\nThey can go to any convenience store, fast food joint, grocery store, etc and use their bathroom, not some random person's house!", "NTA this is wild! Who would expect to be let in to a strangers home? And who would want to go in a strangers home?", "NTA! Never allow strangers into your house! That's really shady and creepy. Even if it was totally innocent, that's just bizarre to ask of a stranger. They could have looked up the closest place with a public restroom, or she could pop a squat somewhere. It may have been nothing, or you may have avoided a robbery or worse. Good for you, keep following your instincts.", "NTA\n\nYou will never be TA choosing to put your safety inside your own home over the request of a stranger.", "I would have said no unless they were old and infirm, or pregnant. I would not have felt comfortable at all but in those circumstances instances I\u2019d have it allowed it. Otherwise not a chance.", "Yes - YTA. Anyone who would force someone to soil themselves to avoid being put out for a couple of minutes is an AH without question.\n\nI am astounded that I am the first person to say that.

I thought you Americans all had guns, so you don\u2019t need to be afraid.", "NTA. \nIt could be a scam, it could be worse. Sure, it also could be harmless, but i would NOT bet my life on it. \nEspecially if there is a McDonald's 2 mins away (as op stated in one of the comments).\n\nIts playing Russian Roulette, anyone with common sense and a will to live would pass.", "No, you did nothing wrong.  If we lived in different times, it would be natural to let a stranger in, but unfortunately, there have been too many instances of home invasions occurring, and often it is the people that can't imagine such behavior that are victims.  Your intuition was spot-on, even if they were harmless, as you really just don't know these days.", "NTA. Don\u2019t let strangers in your house. I would find a gas station or bush before knocking on a stranger\u2019s door to ask to use a bathroom.

NTA!", "Gas stations, grocery stores, restaurants all exist in most places and have restrooms available to the public. NAH", "NTA.  It was almost certainly a scam.", "Yes there are plenty of places. We live smack dab in the middle of a European city. There's a McDonalds and a Burger King three streets over...", "I wouldn't have either, but my parents had only left like 3 minutes before. So I assumed one of them must've forgotten their phone or wallet or something of the like. If either had been home, I'd have allowed them to get the door.", "Yeah but if they felt like stealing your stuff or killing you or snatching you, even if they\u2019d get caught with the IDs you sent, your stuff would still be gone, or you\u2019d be gone, or you\u2019d still be dead. There isn\u2019t really a safe way to do this except like having a security team in your house while it\u2019s happening haha", "I'd say \"there's a Burger King 3 streets over\" (according to OP) and shut the door. Who doesn't have Google maps on their phone (or similar) and can't map a nearby restroom that's open to the public?!", "Your reply actually made me laugh out loud. Thanks for making my evening!", "OP says in comments McDonalds is a 2 min walk away and Burger King is three streets over. That makes them assholes for bothering a random private person's home.", "Right?! And I guess I can just \\*about\\* see the husband coming with her in case the door-opener is a weirdo, but speaking for her too? Nah, something hinky about that", "I would disagree. Walking up to a random person's home, bothering them in their day, and wanting to invade the privacy of their home when there are other options (gas station, market, fast food place, behind a tree) makes you an asshole. \n\nMost likely, they had other nefarious intentions which obviously make them an asshole", "Or they could have been vampires and needed the invitation in so they could suck his blood.  lol, ok I read too much.", "I mean, outside is also an option, if it's really an emergency. I would go for that over a strangers house.", "Even if nothing happened this time, they could be casing the place, taking notes on occupants and figuring out points of entry. I\u2019m not trying to freak anyone out but these are real possibilities that we all need to be aware of.", "I\u2019m a very pregnant lady that has to pee approximately every 2 minutes. I still wouldn\u2019t knock on a strangers door and expect to use their restroom. Such a weird expectation.", "I am not an American I'm an EU citizen.", "How dumb are you for real?", "Yes I think it is worth it to allow someone to soil themselves! Considering that another alternative is getting assaulted! Or robbed! Like, drive to a gas station.", "Just because we have guns doesn't mean we carry them all the time. And not all Americans have guns. The dangers of letting a stranger in your home are not worth it. OP is NTA.", "We are talking about adults here. The wife's need to pee is not OP'S responsibility. Even IF all Americans had guns, which we don't, it doesn't mean we walk around in our homes packing heat ready for action. Also, it doesn't mean we actually WANT to have to threaten or shoot someone. Most decent people hope to never have to cross that line. Home invasion is a real thing, not just something you see in movies. This time of year is particularly bad for robberies. OP is only responsible for keeping themselves safe in their home. No one has the right to force themselves into OP's space. Unless OP lives in a Starbucks, pretty sure they don't have any obligation to allow the use of their bathroom.", "And also not to mention that I live in the middle of a fairly important city where there's a McDonalds 2 minutes walk from my house...", "OP is in the middle of an EU city. Not everyone is in America. And not every American has guns, jfc. \n\nLast, no one is \"forcing\" anyone to soil themselves. They made the choice to go to a random person's home - OP says there are tons of convenience stores, groceries, etc around where they could have gone.", "Most US households don\u2019t actually have a gun, it\u2019s under 50%. But even so, it\u2019s typically frowned upon to answer the door with a gun, ya know?", "Dumbest person is this comment section", "Did your folks leave through the front door? They may have watched them leave and decided to see if anyone was still home and if they locked the door. The bathroom story was a cover for when you answered the door. Sounds to me like they were trying to case the house or outright rob it if the door was open.", "Eh, I've had an experience driving home from somewhere where I know I just wouldn't make it back to my house.  I'm talking only a couple of miles with no commercial properties in the area.  Fortunately, my parents house was on the way and we were just driving past it, so I stopped there (BARELY made it).  I can absolutely see how it can happen.\n\nIf it was nothing nefarious, then it was just a request.  Nothing about that makes them an AH.", "Exactly, it seemed completely out of left field for them to ring my doorbell and ask to use my toilet. Nobody does this.", "This right here. I'm thoroughly creeped out for OP and sooooo glad they didn't let those weirdos in!", "But that's not the case here. You went to your parents' house and there were no other places to go. In this case, there WERE commercial places 3 streets over and this is not their parents' home.\n\nI find it incredibly rude to go to someone's house uninvited and bother them, especially if you don't know that person.", "Yeah sure, but these were Christmas shoppers.", "Meaning?"]}
