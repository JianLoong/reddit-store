Not 5 minutes go by and another couple tap my boyfriend on the shoulder and said \u201cwe were sitting here\u201d This place is pretty large and my friends made no mention of this because they assumed the other couple had left because they were gone for a while with all their things. So we move to chairs that we pulled from another table and the dude puts his hand out to shake my hand and i just kinda looked at him, i was truthfully a bit annoyed still so i don\u2019t want to shake your hand stranger. My boyfriend goes to shake his hand and the dude pulled it away in like an ego shattered kinda way. AITA here for not wanting to shake this strangers hand. I know i explained it awfully but still i feel a bit bad for just staring at him but like why invoke lunchroom rules.", "created_utc": 1678605831, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11p8e0f/aita_for_no_shaking_a_strangers_hand_after/", "score": 48, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
