That's certainly a choice.", "YTA\n\nThe F14 is his kid, not the M17.  You can't force that relationship.  Not matter hard you and your M17 want  it, it doesn't exist.  You are driving away your  F14 and ruining that relationship chasing a dream that won't ever happen.\n\nKnock it off.", "YTA. I can understand how this is hurtful, but ultimately he is not responsible for or obligated to your son. And your daughter shouldn't be punished because she got a gift your son wanted.\n\nDo you receive child support for the other two children?", "YTA. Your son is not his son. All the other details you have given are irrelevant. He is not obligated to do anything for your son. You can\u2019t punish your daughter because she has a father who wants to provide for her. It\u2019s a shame that your son doesn\u2019t have a father but it is what it is. You need to apologise to your daughter and your ex. You\u2019ve also got to stop being so imposing and demanding.", "Your ex has been in your child's life between the ages of 2 (when you started dating) and 10 (when you get divorced). He is not the biological father nor did he adopt your son as his own, so while it's a shitty for your child, he does not have any legal obligations toward your son.\n\nYou cannot make him be a dad to your son and you're going to need to figure out a way to explain that to your son and to yourself. \n\nYou are currently married, right? How long has that person been in your child's life and are they a good father to your son? If so, I would focus on building that relationship up instead of focusing so much on what your ex is doing or not doing.\n\nBut, this, though:  \n\n\n>I took it away and told her she is not allowed to use it in my home\n\n100% the asshole here for punishing your 14YO child for something that she had no control over. She does not control what her dad buys her for your birthday. And she should not lose her gift because \"it's what her brother wanted\". WTF. Absolutely unfair to her.", "INFO:  Your comments indicate that your daughter holds deep anger/resentment towards your son, and that part of this is that your daughter's father is choosing to respect her feelings towards your son and keep distance between them rather than continue his fatherly role in your son's life.  So my question is:  *why* does your daughter hate/resent her brother so much?\n\nThere are cases where it is fully appropriate for him to be acting like this, and cases where he would be supporting cruel behavior.  But given the fact that he has primary custody over your daughter, he was formerly very close to your son and has now done a 180, I do wonder if your daughter has valid reasons for not wanting to be in your house or around her brother, and that your ex may be right to respect those.\n\nEdit:  And THERE it is.  YTA, OP.  Your daughter doesn't want your son around because he bullies her, and you are contributing to the situation by saying that it's \"just a fact\" that your oldest son is *better* than your daughter and therefore deserves to get more attention/better treatment.  Your ex is providing a safe space for your daughter because YOU refuse to deal with the issues your daughter has brought up.  It is YOUR ACTIONS that have cost your son the man he considered to be his father because your daughter needs at least one supportive parent while your son already has one.", "YTA. \n\nThis person is not your sons father - he might be the only father figure your son has known but that doesn\u2019t make him his actual father. It\u2019s also not a role you can force on him and you are 100% the AH for trying to do so. \n\nYou need to have a difficult conversation with your son and stop punishing your daughter just because you both have been stuffing your heads in the sand when it comes to your ex\u2019s actual relationship and responsibility to your son.", "YTA. Having read the post and the comments you've made I find you to be an unreliable narrator. You are being incredibly unfair to your daughter and favoring your oldest son to an absurd degree. If I were to venture a guess this is probably why your ex doesn't want to be part of your eldest son's life and why he has been cut off from the \"fancy\" stuff you seem so intent on him being owed. My guess is that you and your son aren't treating you daughter very well and I am happy that she has her father in her corner and protecting her best interest as you seem to have little to no regard to how she feels about all of this. Some might say that that is the \"cruel and heartless\" behavior. You might want to consider the fact that if you keep treating your daughter this way, she will eventually go no contact with you.", "YTA. Your poor daughter. You ruined her birthday by being unhinged. Your poor ex husband is not required to be a father to a child he is not the father of.

And by the way, like or not, your son is not your ex-husbands responsibility.", "Yta, you have been divorced for years, that means the kids was 10 when that happened.

Stop punishing your daughter for a relationship that doesn't exist and can't be forced between HER FATHER and YOUR son. Get your son into counseling to help him process the loss, if necessary, but stop making this your daughter's problem.

Step parenting is complicated in many ways so can divorce.  Combining the 2 and there is no easy answer based on so little information.", "YTA You can't force him to be  father to your son.  Do you want to have a relationship with your daughter? The type of relationship you have with your daughter is the only thing you have control over. In the comments  you stated he had primary custody.  Do you want to end up with no visitation at all? How do you think a judge would view what you did? Taking away a birthday gift from your daughter because her father bought her the same computer your oldest son wanted. Imagine telling a judge that your ex is your son father even though he isn't biological related to him nor did he adopt your son. I can't make a determination on whether or not your ex is also an AH because I don't know his side of the story.  I don't know if he agree to take on a fatherly role for your son or if he always saw him as just your son who he was nice to while you were together. What I can say is based on your post you seem to be willing to punish your daughter and damage your relationship with her because your ex won't be a father to your son from another relationship.", "I was going to go with E-S-H, but after reading your comments, YTA.

Him for cutting off a child like it was nothing and you for taking your daughter's gift away.\n\nWhat you should be doing is getting your eldest therapy because of what your ex did. Your ex obviously doesn't consider your son his child. You shouldn't try to change that because your children will be the only ones hurt.\n\nEdit: Your responses indicate that your son doesn't treat his sister well and that you are dismissing it as \"siblings squabbling\". Why don't you consider your daughter \"bragging\" about her new mac book \"siblings squabbling\" as well? Whether you admit it or not, you are favoring your son. Its no surprise she didn't want her brother there. Thankfully her dad is in her corner and making sure she is happy on her birthday.\n\nChanging to YTA since its clear your son is your golden child.", "YTA. If the issue really is you somehow feel your ex should care for a child that is not biologically his, that is not your call to make.

You currently have a new husband, he should be the one to be a father figure for your son. You should look into therapy, your behavior and mentality described here is concerning.", "YTA.

Why are you punishing her by taking away her gift? Did she rub it in your sons face or something or did you just feel bad for your son?\nYour ex husband is clearly an asshole. To act as a father figure in your son\u2019s life from when he was 2-10 years old then to cut him off once you got divorced is gross. And did he not let your son to your daughters birthday party? Did she not want him there or was it a decision made by your ex husband? Regardless of him being your ex husband\u2019s son or not, he is still your daughters brother and should be at her birthday party\n\nEDIT: After reading OP\u2019s comments, she clearly favours her son over her daughter and this post does not contain the full story to make a proper judgement.", "YTA", "YTA that\u2019s not his kid.

Your ex was part of someone\u2019s life for the better part of a decade, someone who had no autonomy in that situation and therefore couldn\u2019t have had the opportunity to find their own father figure.

I had an ex whose mother was like this because he looked like her dead husband. Totally unhealthy all around.", "Exactly. I know people who would have been happy to continue a relationship with their stepkids post-divorce, but their ex made it difficult. OP definitely seems like one of those.", "Oh! That explains a lot!", "Did he adopt him ?\n\nIf not then he was just a stepfather.", "Apparently, he doesn't love him or you.  He might have pretended to because you seem like the type that would push your son on him by force.\n\nYTA.", "OP, have you ever had a kind but firm conversation with your son to let him know that he is not obligated to a relationship with your ex, or have you just continued to try to force this relationship despite how detrimental it clearly is for all involved.", "I\u2019m so confused about why this is suddenly an issue after 7 years.\n\nINFO: has your ex been involved *at all* with your son in the last 7 years?", "Because your youngest son isn\u2019t a whining bully who steals her birthday gift! \n\nYTA infinity!!!", "(*ren.). Oh, wait... No, you don't.", "Clearly you do not. \n\nIdk why you favor your son over your daughter but lady, understand that this is not a situation in which you are entitled to voice an opinion. Whether your ex wants to had a relationship with your son is up to him, not you or your son. Punishing your daughter will not change your ex\u2019s mind. To the contrary, it will make your ex hate you and your son even more. The reality is your son is not your ex\u2019s son. Period. No matter what you and you son wants it to be otherwise. They\u2019re not biologically related and your ex has made himself clear that he does not or no longer loves your son. If the courts got wind of this, you have a good chance of losing custody of your daughter before she turns 18.\n\nBut I suspect there is something much more nefarious in play. It sounds like your ex has $, but you and your son do not yet feel entitled to his money despite the fact you divorced. The new stepdad likely does not have $.", "Except for the bully apparently\u2026YTA", "Not for long. She\u2019ll bail as soon as she can. YTA", "Ew.", "Wow sounds like you hate her. I hope your ex gets full custody so she doesn\u2019t continue to get emotionally abused by you.", "look even if she did do it on purpose, she's 14. What's your excuse for acting like a child?", "Get some help. I don\u2019t know your child but she will go no contact when she hits 18", ">The reason the ex doesn't want contact with the son is because the son is bullying the daughter.\n\nFrom what I've read from the OP on this post I'm pretty sure she's bullying the daughter too.", "My siblings didn't abuse me either.

Unfortunately, Rule 1 requires me to be civil.", "See I was ready to say your actions weren't great but your heart was in the right place but after reading comments it's clear your son is your golden child and your daughter the scapegoat. You enable his bullying and don't support her not wanting to spend time with her brother. If it had been your ex's decision, son likely would have been there. But it wasn't, it was the decision of the girl who doesn't want her bully at her birthday party.\n\nYou don't have to worry about your daughter. She'll be spending as little time around you as possible from now on so you can continue to spoil your golden child.", "But why would you even get involved with this?  You said that your son\u2019s actions are just sibling squabbling \u2026 so your daughter rubbing the gift in his face (if she really is doing that) is just the same thing, sibling squabbling. \n\nSo according to your own rules, you should have just stayed out of it. Why did you get involved at all?", "Yeah, yta. This alone would be enough", "Your daughter\u2019s party her rules! \n\nAlong with the following neither of you will be invited to:\n\nHer graduations\n\nHer wedding \n\nAnything to do with any children she has\n\n But you\u2019re not worried because you have your Golden Sonny Boy. I hope he can pick a decent nursing home for you because I suspect your poor daughter is going no contact with you as soon as possible. \n\nThat\u2019s what I did with my narcissist mom. She and her Golden Child are living happily ever after since my siblings and I haven\u2019t spoken to her in years", "OP, your daughter is at an age where her opinion matters in custody hearings. \n\nYou need to focus on your relationship with your daughter instead of trying to force one between your son and your ex. \n\nWhat you are doing is going to ensure that she doesn't have a relationship with you or your son.", "You give serious vibes of being a Boy Mom.", "She'll be moving out a soon as she can and I doubt anyone in here would be shocked.\n\nYou're gonna find yourself all alone some day.

I can see why, too.", "So, you're willing to completely lose your daughter because you can't get it through your head that it's not her fault your ex chose not to stay in your son's life after your divorce. YTA for punishing her in the name of your son. That's building resentment btw & you're not being a good mom to *her* by acting how you are. You should love ALL of your children more than you hate your ex. Right now you're not doing that & it's only going to cause you to lose at least one child if you don't stop behaving this way. \n\nIt's sad that your ex doesn't want to be your son's dad, but he didn't adopt him & has no legal relationship or obligation to him anymore. Get your son therapy & also talk with him about not blaming his sister for what her dad does because right now the message you're sending is that she's to blame when that's not true. Grow up & start being a better parent to all of your kids before it's too late if you haven't lost your daughter after this fit.", "I don't think the brother is bullying her nothing implies that. The implication is that the mothers actually doing the bullying.", "You ever considered that your behaviour has caused a rift between your son and daughter?\n\nIn this story, you literally punished your daughter because of an issue that you have with your ex.
