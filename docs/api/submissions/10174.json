It is infuriating at times, but I get paid well so I've learned to live with it.\n\n2 - My girlfriend loves flowers more than anything. I get it, most girls love flowers, but they are her favorite thing in the world. She literally makes me stop the car when we're driving just so she can take pictures of pretty flowers.\n\nEarly in our relationship, I had to miss something important without notice. To make up for it, I sent her 3 dozen roses. She loved it and (probably as a joke) told me I had set the bar and I had better always send her 3 dozen roses if I was going to let her down.\n\nWe've been together 3 years since then, and I have always sent 3 dozen roses whenever we would be apart. It's a tradition and we both love it.\n\nOnto the dilemma - GF got bad news about a family member's health and headed back to her hometown a couple weeks ago; I couldn\u2019t join. Her two sisters came back as well with their husbands.\n\nValentine's day came around and, although it wasn't my fault we weren't together, I ordered a gift of 3 dozen roses + candy and a stuffed animal. Day of, I got an alert from Fedex of a delayed shipment and panicked - it broke my heart to think she wouldn't get any flowers that day, so I called around to local florists and found one who could deliver them for a fee. I sent another gift pack of 3-dozen roses.\n\nTurns out Fedex managed to deliver the original package. GF ended up with 6 dozen roses, 2 cards, 2 boxes of chocolates and a teddy bear. She joked that I had now raised the bar and she expected no less than 6 dozen roses any time we were apart. All jokes aside, I could tell she really appreciated the trouble I went through.\n\nThe next day, I heard from her sisters' husbands. They were FURIOUS with me, saying I made the both look awful. Turns out one bought his wife a leftover bouquet of half-dead tulips, and the other didn't get his wife anything at all. I guess they both were going to use the commotion as an excuse? My GF ended up sharing her roses with both of her sisters so they all could feel special, but it was clear they were all from me.\n\nMy instinct was to take a victory lap, but GF's mom/dad called and explained that they thought I should apologize. While they appreciate me always making romantic gestures, I can afford to do so while their other daughters' husbands can't. They see where things are going and assume we'll all be family soon, and it would be a good idea for me to make peace with the other two.\n\nThat's true in the sense that I really didn't mean to do anything to their detriment, but I also never expected them to be such shitty partners that they thought it would be okay to not even bring their wives flowers on Valentine's Day. But maybe I'm wrong for holding them to the standard I've set for my own relationship.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1676620252, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/114dxdx/aita_for_sending_my_girlfriend_too_many/", "score": 933, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sorry your wife's sisters have shitty husbands, not your fault.\n\nBut yeah, now that this is official Reddit lore, we all expect you to send no less than 6 dozen roses any time you two are apart \ud83d\ude0f", "There's 8 adults in the situation. \n\n- One of them sent flowers, \n- One of them received flowers, \n- Four of them are jealous and stole flowers not meant for them, \n- Two of them are enabling the jealousy\n\nPlain and simple. NTA.", "NTA - you did not make them look bad, THEY made them look bad. Its not about the amount of flowers or how much it all cost, but the meaning behind it.", "NTA. \n\nMy husband got me nothing because he was sick with a cold and forgot. If  my sister's partner had 72 flowers delivered to her in front of us, I would think her BF is a sweetie, but that's it. My husband would see that, make a silly self-deprecating joke, and we'd all laugh and carry on.\n\nYour GF's sisters' partners are rude. If they're really this mad about it they should have done better.", "NTA \nNot one bit.  You can't get mad at someone for spoiling their SO.  I would get if you went over the top and actually sent like a full circus to the door, but 6 dozen flowers and chocolates and the whole 9 is incredibly sweet.  \nThat's your person, you're supposed to make them feel special and loved.  She is lucky to have you and you're lucky to have her.  Send her 10 dozen next time and a life-sized, stuffed bear.  \nKudos to you for making her happy", "NTA, and you guys have a sweet tradition. You didn't make your future sisters-in-law's husbands look bad, they did that all by themselves. I suppose you could talk with them about not upstaging them too badly for future shared events, but I wouldn't apologize, and I certainly wouldn't \"check-in\" with them when your planning something with/for your GF. Just imagine the hoops you'd have to go through planning your wedding around not hurting their feelings...", "NTA. Everyone does their own thing.", "What? Nta at all! And let's face it, it is not about money. You are right, they just didn't want to bother. You keep your girlfriend happy and don't pay them any attention. \n\nIt is a good opportunity to apologize with an insult,  you know say something like \"so sorry I didn't realise you are such bad husbands, next time I will keep that in mind\". But more polite", "NTA\nI would bring them all together and tell them to Fack off. It's a gift for your gf and you didn't even think about them at all.", "As someone who frequents this sub, this is one of the more ridiculous ones. Wtf? Why should anyone think you should apologise?! What I am hearing is that they don\u2019t want you to ever be so extravagant as it may make others look bad. Ridiculous! You sound like an amazing partner, and a great relationship with your girlfriend. Ignore this nonsense. NTA", "I'd like to start off by saying this is why people are so many are anti-valentines, not because of YOU but because of the hoopla of the day. We should be spoiling our loved ones every day with gestures of love, not just material things. \n\nNTA, It isn't your fault one dude did bare minimum and the other didn't do shit. Maybe if they showed love more often than once a year, the wives wouldn't be jealous of another sisters gifts? Your tradition is sweet, if your bills are paid, foods in the fridge, who gives a fuck how you spoil each other? \n\nThe husbands need to learn you don't need money to do thoughtful and meaningful gestures for their spouses. \n\nI don't think you should apologize, but I also don't think you should flex constantly either in front of them, then it goes from you having a tradition with your wife to you just showing off your money and your gesture being meaningless. That WILL ruin any future chance to bond with any of them. This was a special circumstance, if in the future you only do it when they are around, then you'd be the asshole.", "Nah, screw it. You don't have to scale back on your (frankly very sweet) tradition with your girlfriend to pander to the insecurities of two grown adult men.\n\nIf they were 'furious' for you at this, they will find similar things to hold against you in the future. Are you willing to always diminish your relationship with your SO for their benefit?\n\nPersonally, we don't do Valentines day. But if we did, I wouldn't feel upstaged or the need to upstage someone elses' declarations.\n\nEdit: Thinking about it a bit more. The husbands didn't look bad because you have enough money to buy six dozen roses. *The husbands look bad because they did sweet FA*. There are plenty of things you can do for Valentines that don't involve expensive meals or large bunches of flowers, and they made no effort. That's why they look bad, not because you have money and they don't, but because you care enough to make some sort of meaningful gesture and they didn't.\n\nSeriously, what sort of messed up situation is it where someone can be considered an asshole for buying his girlfriend too many flowers?", "NTA.\n\nThose boys need to learn a lesson in humility. Her parents need to zip it. It is 100% not your problem that her siblings' hubby's put little or no effort in .", "NTA. The three dozen roses tradition is cute and loving. Props to you for particularly wanting to do something nice when you have to miss an event or special day.\n\nThe only thing that surprises me here is that it\u2019s news to your SIL\u2019s that you send 3 dozen roses regularly.\n\nAlso, if the BIL\u2019s made any kind of actual effort, they wouldn\u2019t have looked so crappy, even if it wasn\u2019t as extravagant as 6 dozen red roses.", "SOLID NTA. \n\nAlso your username is epic by the way. No, it\u2019s not your fault he\u2019s a lousy husband", "... romantic gestures don't have to cost a lot of money. \n\n\nThe left over boquet of half dead tulpins probably did cost as much as a fresh one. \n\n\n\nYour gfs parents defend lazy behaviour. That is it. Yes 72 roses are a ton. But the wives would probably already be happy with one nice rose and maybe their favorit normal prized chocolate. \n\n\nNTA", "NTA for showing up other husbands, BUT, did you consider that such a big gesture sent to her family home might come off as sort of tactless when her family is in the middle of a health crisis? Someone in their family might be dying or seriously sick and here you are celebrating with this huge over-the-top gesture.\n\nObviously, things weren't bad enough at home to be consumed with jealousy over a silly gift, but maybe the husbands had a legit reason for not being able to get something organized. If they had a health scare, maybe emotions are just high right now, things are tense, and apologizing is the right thing on this event to just keep the peace.", "NAH. You did a thoughtful, lovely thing for your wife.\n\nYour wife did a lovely, thoughtful thing by sharing her flowers.\n\nHer sisters felt good about the flowers and told their husbands.\nThe husbands feel insecure and behaved poorly, but most people behave poorly when they feel insecure.\n\nThe parents are trying to keep the peace.\n\nYou're all fine. The other husbands should be more thoughtful if they care that much about their wives' feelings, but honestly this all seems so small. I think these dudes must have it pretty good in general that they could get so bent out of shape over somebody else's husband buying flowers.", "NTA, they are grieving probably a lot and understandable and everything but you are never the asshole for giving your GF gifts on Valentine's card.\n\nIt's obviously a them problem and they sound jealous as hell lol, keep doing you and ignore those people", "NTA. \n\nWtf? Personally, I can't afford to get 3 bouquets of flowers for my partner, but I wouldn't be furious with my soon-to-be \"brother-in-law\" or brothers for getting better gifts for their partners. \nSo petty that they\u2019d make a fuss out of this. Looks like their wallets aren\u2019t the only thing smaller than yours. Lol", "NTA dude you sound like a wonderful partner, and the sisters husbands sound quite unthoughtful, though I don't know the situation at the parents house it could be quite chaotic and they forgot. \n\nEither way you're cool, maybe just say sorry to keep the peace but keep doing what you're doing pal, sounds like your girlfriend loves it and that's all that matters!", "NTA. you, sir, are a king. happy valentine\u2019s day to you both, sending good vibes to your gal\u2019s family.", "Eh. You did nothing wrong,  but you also sound quite judgy about the guys who might be your future BILs. You don't know if they're great partners in other ways-- maybe one does the lion's share of cleaning in his house,  for example,  or one is a super caring and present dad. By your own account, you buy so many flowers because you aren't always physically present for your gf, and you can only afford it because you have a high-paying job that means you often aren't there for your gf in person,  so maybe they manage to make up for their lack of flowers in other ways. \n\nThis still doesn't make you the AH for buying your girlfriend a lot of flowers, and they should not have been furious with you... but they aren't the ones here asking whether they are assholes. Since you hope to have a good relationship with these guys in the future,  I think the advice to patch things up with them somehow is a good one.  Maybe this means telling them the story of why you always get her so many flowers or how there ended up being SO many this time.  Maybe it just means poking a bit of fun at yourself and giving a joking apology for being \"that guy.\" It doesn't mean judging them for being crappy spouses or choosing your ego over a good relationship with the people who might be your family in the future.\n\nI don't really feel like I can make a judgment here about whether you are the AH or not,  honestly-- that depends on how you handle this.  REALLY honoring your girlfriend means prioritizing having a good relationship with her family, not gloating about your own \"standards,\" \"taking a victory lap,\" or calling her BILs shitty partners.", "NTA.\n\nJust because the other two husbands are shitty at being thoughtful, doesn\u2019t mean you have to lower yourself and grovel at their feet.\n\nThe parents need to mind their own business, and the husbands need to grow up.", "This must be a joke, right? Are there really adults who care this much about Valentine's day?\n\n1. The husbands' lack of preparation has nothing to do with you. There's nothing you need to apologize for.\n\n2. Most people I know would rather have their partner by their side in a family emergency than receive flowers.\nSo, your gf's sisters should be happy.\n\n3. Romantic gestures that only occur on VD are empty gestures. True romance is not just limited to one day. If those husbands don't limit romance to one day per year they shouldn't look bad.\n\n4. What did the sisters get / do for their husbands? If they didn't get or do anything they shouldn't expect anything in return. Are they even upset? You've only mentioned the husbands and your gf's parents.\n\n5. Your gf's parents should stay out of this. It has nothing to do with them and they're just contributing to unnecessary drama.\n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2019s about thinking and planning ahead, and showing care through the actions not the items.\n\nNTA\n\nThat said as a former florist plz always local florists and not like 1800Flowers lol the local florist makes more when you order direct as you did for the second bouquet (and maybe the first too! Just a PSA lol)", "NTA. Yes, you can afford more and sent an extravagant gift. Those other guys didn\u2019t even try. At BJs and Costco (if you are in the US) they had beautiful arrangements for $18 - $40. I am sure their wives would have been happy with that and a card. I think your future in-laws are ignoring the complete lack of effort.", "NTA.  Their issues aren't your problem.", "It's not about the money or extravagance. It's about the fact that you tried. You put in effort and thought. They didn't.\n\nThey could have done well with even a handwritten love note.\n\nNTA and I think it's adorable what you did", "Wow.  NTA. And this whole situation is ridiculous. Your romantic gestures aren\u2019t anyone else\u2019s business. If future SIL\u2019s husbands have become this comfortable with minimum/no effort that\u2019s neither your problem nor your concern. \n\nStay romantic. It fades away so easily.", "NTA \n\nFirst of all, the parents need to mind their business. Secondly, it isn't your fault the sisters married lazy AH.", "NTA- the other girls husbands are though wtf", "NTA but I don\u2019t think they are shitty husbands just based off what you said. Different couples are going to celebrate holidays different and just because you spend more money doesn\u2019t mean you love someone more. With that being said I wouldn\u2019t be upset if my brother in laws did more for my sisters than my husband did, and would never ask for an apology for it. Husband and I don\u2019t do gifts, we\u2019ve established that ahead of time, all I want for Valentine\u2019s Day is sex, as long as I get that I\u2019m happy.", "NTA.  It's not your responsibility to make them look better.  It would be different if you had sent their wives flowers directly, but your gf shared her gifts with her sisters.  If someone has a problem with your generosity, then, kick rocks.", "NTA, it's not your fault that the two husbands made no effort for their wives and you have no reason to make peace. I could understand making piece if they did try but just couldn't afford to do what you did and the wives were upset. But that didn't happen.", "NTA! Please don\u2019t apologize OP! Those losers need to do better!", "NTA. You are a wonderful dude.", "NTA. It doesn\u2019t cost that much money to make your wife feel special on Valentine\u2019s Day. They didn\u2019t need to buy 6 dozen roses. The point being, your future BILs dropped the ball and just didn\u2019t make any effort to show their love/appreciation. Not your fault.", "NTA. You choose to treat your wife like a man is suppose to. If they cannot afford roses, they are more than capable of finding other ways to make their wives feel loved and appreciated as well, they just choose not to. Don't ever let another man make you feel bad about treating your wife right. You aren't making them look bad, they are doing that themselves. It's not about the money spent, it's about the effort put in.", "NTA!!! Their choice to be crappy partners isn\u2019t your problem. You put in the effort, they didn\u2019t. It amazes me her parents want you to apologize when their daughters are the ones who have husbands who can\u2019t even try to do something nice for them for Valentine\u2019s Day.", "NTA. Also brb sending this post to my fianc\u00e9.", "Please.  Some of the most romantic gestures I have ever received were not things that cost money. \n\nYou owe no one an apology.  But the mom/dad are epic assholes.  Tell your girlfriend and let her handle it.", "WTF is wrong with her family??? Instead of being mad at you, they should step up their game. You owe no one an apology! NTA", "So let me get this straight; your GF's parents want you to apologize for exposing your GFs BIL's for being crappy husband's? NTA. Maybe this will force them to get their act together", "NTA\nWhat precisely do her parents think you need to apologise for?", ">While they appreciate me always making romantic gestures, I can afford to do so while their other daughters' husbands can't.\n\nThere are many times that valentines day with my husband has been us splitting a $1 box of chocolates, making cards for each other, and having a simple dinner at home after the kids are in bed. If they wanted to make an effort, they could have. You don't have to spend a lot of money to show someone you care.", "You\u2019re a great husband. I can\u2019t wait for mine \u2764\ufe0f", "You're not making them look bad, you're making yourself look good. If they look bad by comparison that's on them.", "NTA. Those other guys suck and want you to apologize. This makes zero sense. Keep doing what you\u2019re doing.", "NTA, no way you should apologize for making sure your gf feels special. \n\nThe husbands can\u2019t blame you for their own shortcomings. You didn\u2019t make them look bad they did that to themselves.", "NTA. \n\nBut if you can find it in you to be the bigger person, do so.\n\nExplain the mixup with fedex, explain the \"in joke\" of 3 dozen roses, you'll be golden.", "NTA\nUtterly absurd of your beloved\u2019s family to ask you to apologize and passively aggressively suggest that you come down to their level.", "NTA. You should apologize to the sisters for their partners and send them a dozen roses", "YOU should apologize for their husbands being AH's?  It was for your GF, everyone else needs to mind their own business or maybe step up their game.  It's between the two of you, that's it!", "NTA", "NTA\nThey made themselves look bad. It's not your fault they didn't put in any effort.", "I love how much you take care of your girlfriend. Ignore everyone else. You\u2019re amazing! Nth", "NTA. If the other husbands don't wish to look like clowns, they can put forth a tiny amount of effort.", " Not your issue.", ">Turns out one bought his wife a leftover bouquet of half-dead tulips, and the other didn't get his wife anything at all.\n\nI stand firm in my belief that people give their in-laws too much input into their lives in a lot of situations and this is definitely one of those. Their husbands didn't try for whatever reason. That's not something you can apologize to them over. \n\n>They see where things are going and assume we'll all be family soon, and it would be a good idea for me to make peace with the other two.\n\nThe next time you send her anything, it's going to be the same anger. Definitely **don't** start sending your gf six dozen flowers from now on because the three dozen thing was cute but this would not be. That has nothing to do with your maybe BILs. This was circumstances that played out one time. NTA.", "NTA. They are the only ones who made themselves look bad. Whereas you're showing your partner you know her, you care for her, and you think about her even when you're busy and can't be together. A1 sir, keep it up.", "I believe this is also a fake piece but what the H No OP NTA for sending flowers and you can\u2019t coordinate you show of affection with two other couple even if they are family", "Absolutely NTA. Keep being a king to your queen!", "NTA for the flowers and doing your best to keep your traditions. But you last statements about them being shitty husbands because they didn\u2019t spend a lot on flowers and you holding them up to your standards doesn\u2019t put you in a good light. I wouldn\u2019t want to have close relations to an in law who says things like this, and likely behaves accordingly. So based on that alone I guess this is more complicated in reality.", "NTA,  and I agree. When there is an imbalance like this, why would you try to make the make the \"positive\" act less positive in order to even it out? That makes no sense.", "NTA! Hardcore NTA. You are a thoughtful BF. REALLY thoughtful! The sil's hubbies learned an important lesson. And the sil's VDay was made a bit better with your gf's kindness. It's not the candy or bear or flowers. You thought ahead, and made it happen-x2! Well done OP.", "Let\u2019s be honest here, it\u2019s not about the roses. It\u2019s about them not caring and doing anything. You can always make someone smile with a low budget, money isn\u2019t an excuse. They just blame their incompetence on financial difference. Spoiler: it\u2019s not.\n\nNTA", "While I agree OP is NTA. You know, maybe I am wrong, but calling someone a shitty husband over valentines day infractions especially during a family crisis seems unnecessary harsh and misguided.  It\u2019s just a commercial holiday and lots of couples celebrate it differently. \n\nThe last few statements about husbands being shitty and holding them to \u201chis\u201d standards makes me feel there is more to this.", "Plus OP got his girl roses, not because roses are just what you buy on Valentine's day, but because he *knows* she adores flowers. If she loved writing, for instance, I'm sure she would have been showered with stationary. I think that says a lot.", "Agreed. We don't celebrate valentines day; I think it's  a corporate scam. But my husband know I love February 15th, half price chocolate day. Thus year I was feeling unwell, so he went and bought my half price chocolate. It's the thought.", "Personally, I wouldn't even want one bouquet of roses, let alone six. Especially when i might not have anywhere to put them. But if my husband sent me a small bouquet of gerberas, I'd be over the moon. It isn't about extravagance, but knowing your partner and showing that you are thinking of them. OP knows his partner. The sister are upset because their husband's didn't even think about them. That isn't something OP can fix by ignoring his girlfriend.", "My husband bought me a surprise bouquet of a dozen roses on the 13th because we're celebrating on the 20th (restaurant wife life...lol) and he wanted me to have something special on Valentine's Day anyway.  I love roses(I just love having flowers around the house, totally in sympathy with OP's GF here), I loved the surprise, and I LOVE that he wants me to be happy even when he's off making sure Valentine's Day is special for the eleven billion couples at his restaurant that night.", "This is exactly it. They don\u2019t have money, but surely they have brains?? They could\u2019ve thought of *something*.\n\nMy partner and I were broke last year, so we didn\u2019t buy much - I made him some cookies and he made a bunch of origami hearts and hid them around the house like a little scavenger hunt (and there was a chocolate bar at the end hehe). It was honestly one of the best Valentine\u2019s Days ever and it\u2019s because of the thought and love he put into the day - not the money", "That's what I  thought about the parents joining in too.  It's not  just about money.  Valentine's Day is always the same date every year so plenty of notice and they don't need to get anything Vday themed.  One probably picked up the last bunch of flowers at the gas station and the other did nothing at all.  They should be calling those guys and telling them to make an effort for their daughters, but they're hassling the guy who did.  \"I apologise for thinking your daughter is worth the effort.  I apologise for treating her like a Queen.  I apologise for your other daughters' husbands' lack of interest in taking the minimum steps to show their appreciation and commitment for one day each year, m'kay?  We're good.\"", "Good summary but might have to add one more line and make an edit that 2 of them were GIVEN flowers instead of saying they stole them. I think the sister happily shared with her sisters. The sisters probably were jealous so the four jealous part most likely holds true still.", "\"Sorry I made an effort, but I really think my girlfriend is worth it\".  How does that sound?", ">And let's face it, it is not about money\n\nI wonder what would happen if OP marries the GF and plans to buy a house together. Is the family going to ask him not to buy too expensive a house \"because it'll make the other husbands look bad\"? Or if they have kids. Are they going to ask them not to send their kids to an expensive school or buy expensive toys and clothes?\n\nTheir husbands insecurity is not your concern OP. You just do what makes you and your GF happy, let her sisters go deal with their own relationships.", "Exactly! This isn\u2019t about who can afford what. Get creative! OP gave THE most stereotypical gifts possible, which isn\u2019t a knock\u2014they\u2019re stereotypes for a reason, and OP\u2019s girlfriend happens to appreciate those things. But there are a thousand meaningful ways to show someone you care that don\u2019t cost much or anything at all. Just a sign that someone had put some thought into doing something special for me on Valentine\u2019s Day would be enough, no matter how extravagant someone else\u2019s gift was. These guys didn\u2019t even try.", " OP sending them broses also sounds like a wholesome tradition", "No joke, if I were OP I would legit be planning to send all three sisters 6 dozen roses each next valentine's day purely out of spite. Plus you've got to think there's some sort of bulk discount at that point \ud83e\udd23", "Whether or not it backfires will purely depend on his partner.

What did her sisters get their husbands?

Now I get him flowers for his birthday and holidays and special occasions, and he's always so delighted by it. \n\nLike I said, I don't personally like flowers. So I have no reason to give a shit that he never gets me flowers - because he knows this about me. He made me a pizza for VDay this year.
