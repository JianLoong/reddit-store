It is infuriating at times, but I get paid well so I've learned to live with it.\n\n2 - My girlfriend loves flowers more than anything. I get it, most girls love flowers, but they are her favorite thing in the world. She literally makes me stop the car when we're driving just so she can take pictures of pretty flowers.\n\nEarly in our relationship, I had to miss something important without notice. To make up for it, I sent her 3 dozen roses. She loved it and (probably as a joke) told me I had set the bar and I had better always send her 3 dozen roses if I was going to let her down.\n\nWe've been together 3 years since then, and I have always sent 3 dozen roses whenever we would be apart. It's a tradition and we both love it.\n\nOnto the dilemma - GF got bad news about a family member's health and headed back to her hometown a couple weeks ago; I couldn\u2019t join. Her two sisters came back as well with their husbands.\n\nValentine's day came around and, although it wasn't my fault we weren't together, I ordered a gift of 3 dozen roses + candy and a stuffed animal. Day of, I got an alert from Fedex of a delayed shipment and panicked - it broke my heart to think she wouldn't get any flowers that day, so I called around to local florists and found one who could deliver them for a fee. I sent another gift pack of 3-dozen roses.\n\nTurns out Fedex managed to deliver the original package. GF ended up with 6 dozen roses, 2 cards, 2 boxes of chocolates and a teddy bear. She joked that I had now raised the bar and she expected no less than 6 dozen roses any time we were apart. All jokes aside, I could tell she really appreciated the trouble I went through.\n\nThe next day, I heard from her sisters' husbands. They were FURIOUS with me, saying I made the both look awful. Turns out one bought his wife a leftover bouquet of half-dead tulips, and the other didn't get his wife anything at all. I guess they both were going to use the commotion as an excuse? My GF ended up sharing her roses with both of her sisters so they all could feel special, but it was clear they were all from me.\n\nMy instinct was to take a victory lap, but GF's mom/dad called and explained that they thought I should apologize. While they appreciate me always making romantic gestures, I can afford to do so while their other daughters' husbands can't. They see where things are going and assume we'll all be family soon, and it would be a good idea for me to make peace with the other two.\n\nThat's true in the sense that I really didn't mean to do anything to their detriment, but I also never expected them to be such shitty partners that they thought it would be okay to not even bring their wives flowers on Valentine's Day. But maybe I'm wrong for holding them to the standard I've set for my own relationship.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1676620252, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/114dxdx/aita_for_sending_my_girlfriend_too_many/", "score": 210, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sorry your wife's sisters have shitty husbands, not your fault.\n\nBut yeah, now that this is official Reddit lore, we all expect you to send no less than 6 dozen roses any time you two are apart \ud83d\ude0f", "There's 8 adults in the situation. \n\n- One of them sent flowers, \n- One of them received flowers, \n- Four of them are jealous and stole flowers not meant for them, \n- Two of them are enabling the jealousy\n\nPlain and simple. NTA.", "NTA - you did not make them look bad, THEY made them look bad. Its not about the amount of flowers or how much it all cost, but the meaning behind it.", "NTA. \n\nMy husband got me nothing because he was sick with a cold and forgot. If  my sister's partner had 72 flowers delivered to her in front of us, I would think her BF is a sweetie, but that's it. My husband would see that, make a silly self-deprecating joke, and we'd all laugh and carry on.\n\nYour GF's sisters' partners are rude. If they're really this mad about it they should have done better.", "NTA \nNot one bit.  You can't get mad at someone for spoiling their SO.  I would get if you went over the top and actually sent like a full circus to the door, but 6 dozen flowers and chocolates and the whole 9 is incredibly sweet.  \nThat's your person, you're supposed to make them feel special and loved.  She is lucky to have you and you're lucky to have her.  Send her 10 dozen next time and a life-sized, stuffed bear.  \nKudos to you for making her happy", "NTA, and you guys have a sweet tradition. You didn't make your future sisters-in-law's husbands look bad, they did that all by themselves. I suppose you could talk with them about not upstaging them too badly for future shared events, but I wouldn't apologize, and I certainly wouldn't \"check-in\" with them when your planning something with/for your GF. Just imagine the hoops you'd have to go through planning your wedding around not hurting their feelings...", "NTA. Everyone does their own thing.", "What? Nta at all! And let's face it, it is not about money. You are right, they just didn't want to bother. You keep your girlfriend happy and don't pay them any attention. \n\nIt is a good opportunity to apologize with an insult,  you know say something like \"so sorry I didn't realise you are such bad husbands, next time I will keep that in mind\". But more polite", "NTA\nI would bring them all together and tell them to Fack off. It's a gift for your gf and you didn't even think about them at all.", "As someone who frequents this sub, this is one of the more ridiculous ones. Wtf? Why should anyone think you should apologise?! What I am hearing is that they don\u2019t want you to ever be so extravagant as it may make others look bad. Ridiculous! You sound like an amazing partner, and a great relationship with your girlfriend. Ignore this nonsense. NTA", "I'd like to start off by saying this is why people are so many are anti-valentines, not because of YOU but because of the hoopla of the day. We should be spoiling our loved ones every day with gestures of love, not just material things. \n\nNTA, It isn't your fault one dude did bare minimum and the other didn't do shit. Maybe if they showed love more often than once a year, the wives wouldn't be jealous of another sisters gifts? Your tradition is sweet, if your bills are paid, foods in the fridge, who gives a fuck how you spoil each other? \n\nThe husbands need to learn you don't need money to do thoughtful and meaningful gestures for their spouses. \n\nI don't think you should apologize, but I also don't think you should flex constantly either in front of them, then it goes from you having a tradition with your wife to you just showing off your money and your gesture being meaningless. That WILL ruin any future chance to bond with any of them. This was a special circumstance, if in the future you only do it when they are around, then you'd be the asshole.", "Nah, screw it. You don't have to scale back on your (frankly very sweet) tradition with your girlfriend to pander to the insecurities of two grown adult men.\n\nIf they were 'furious' for you at this, they will find similar things to hold against you in the future. Are you willing to always diminish your relationship with your SO for their benefit?\n\nPersonally, we don't do Valentines day. But if we did, I wouldn't feel upstaged or the need to upstage someone elses' declarations.\n\nEdit: Thinking about it a bit more. The husbands didn't look bad because you have enough money to buy six dozen roses. *The husbands look bad because they did sweet FA*. There are plenty of things you can do for Valentines that don't involve expensive meals or large bunches of flowers, and they made no effort. That's why they look bad, not because you have money and they don't, but because you care enough to make some sort of meaningful gesture and they didn't.\n\nSeriously, what sort of messed up situation is it where someone can be considered an asshole for buying his girlfriend too many flowers?", "NTA.\n\nThose boys need to learn a lesson in humility. Her parents need to zip it. It is 100% not your problem that her siblings' hubby's put little or no effort in .", "NTA. The three dozen roses tradition is cute and loving. Props to you for particularly wanting to do something nice when you have to miss an event or special day.\n\nThe only thing that surprises me here is that it\u2019s news to your SIL\u2019s that you send 3 dozen roses regularly.\n\nAlso, if the BIL\u2019s made any kind of actual effort, they wouldn\u2019t have looked so crappy, even if it wasn\u2019t as extravagant as 6 dozen red roses.", "SOLID NTA. \n\nAlso your username is epic by the way. No, it\u2019s not your fault he\u2019s a lousy husband", "... romantic gestures don't have to cost a lot of money. \n\n\nThe left over boquet of half dead tulpins probably did cost as much as a fresh one. \n\n\n\nYour gfs parents defend lazy behaviour. That is it. Yes 72 roses are a ton. But the wives would probably already be happy with one nice rose and maybe their favorit normal prized chocolate. \n\n\nNTA", "NTA for showing up other husbands, BUT, did you consider that such a big gesture sent to her family home might come off as sort of tactless when her family is in the middle of a health crisis? Someone in their family might be dying or seriously sick and here you are celebrating with this huge over-the-top gesture.\n\nObviously, things weren't bad enough at home to be consumed with jealousy over a silly gift, but maybe the husbands had a legit reason for not being able to get something organized. If they had a health scare, maybe emotions are just high right now, things are tense, and apologizing is the right thing on this event to just keep the peace.", "NAH. You did a thoughtful, lovely thing for your wife.\n\nYour wife did a lovely, thoughtful thing by sharing her flowers.\n\nHer sisters felt good about the flowers and told their husbands.\nThe husbands feel insecure and behaved poorly, but most people behave poorly when they feel insecure.\n\nThe parents are trying to keep the peace.\n\nYou're all fine. The other husbands should be more thoughtful if they care that much about their wives' feelings, but honestly this all seems so small. I think these dudes must have it pretty good in general that they could get so bent out of shape over somebody else's husband buying flowers.", "NTA, they are grieving probably a lot and understandable and everything but you are never the asshole for giving your GF gifts on Valentine's card.\n\nIt's obviously a them problem and they sound jealous as hell lol, keep doing you and ignore those people", "NTA. \n\nWtf? Personally, I can't afford to get 3 bouquets of flowers for my partner, but I wouldn't be furious with my soon-to-be \"brother-in-law\" or brothers for getting better gifts for their partners. \nSo petty that they\u2019d make a fuss out of this. Looks like their wallets aren\u2019t the only thing smaller than yours. Lol", "NTA dude you sound like a wonderful partner, and the sisters husbands sound quite unthoughtful, though I don't know the situation at the parents house it could be quite chaotic and they forgot. \n\nEither way you're cool, maybe just say sorry to keep the peace but keep doing what you're doing pal, sounds like your girlfriend loves it and that's all that matters!", "NTA. you, sir, are a king. happy valentine\u2019s day to you both, sending good vibes to your gal\u2019s family.", "Eh. You did nothing wrong,  but you also sound quite judgy about the guys who might be your future BILs. You don't know if they're great partners in other ways-- maybe one does the lion's share of cleaning in his house,  for example,  or one is a super caring and present dad. By your own account, you buy so many flowers because you aren't always physically present for your gf, and you can only afford it because you have a high-paying job that means you often aren't there for your gf in person,  so maybe they manage to make up for their lack of flowers in other ways. \n\nThis still doesn't make you the AH for buying your girlfriend a lot of flowers, and they should not have been furious with you... but they aren't the ones here asking whether they are assholes. Since you hope to have a good relationship with these guys in the future,  I think the advice to patch things up with them somehow is a good one.  Maybe this means telling them the story of why you always get her so many flowers or how there ended up being SO many this time.  Maybe it just means poking a bit of fun at yourself and giving a joking apology for being \"that guy.\" It doesn't mean judging them for being crappy spouses or choosing your ego over a good relationship with the people who might be your family in the future.\n\nI don't really feel like I can make a judgment here about whether you are the AH or not,  honestly-- that depends on how you handle this.  REALLY honoring your girlfriend means prioritizing having a good relationship with her family, not gloating about your own \"standards,\" \"taking a victory lap,\" or calling her BILs shitty partners.", "NTA.\n\nJust because the other two husbands are shitty at being thoughtful, doesn\u2019t mean you have to lower yourself and grovel at their feet.\n\nThe parents need to mind their own business, and the husbands need to grow up.", "This must be a joke, right? Are there really adults who care this much about Valentine's day?\n\n1. The husbands' lack of preparation has nothing to do with you. There's nothing you need to apologize for.\n\n2. Most people I know would rather have their partner by their side in a family emergency than receive flowers.\nSo, your gf's sisters should be happy.\n\n3. Romantic gestures that only occur on VD are empty gestures. True romance is not just limited to one day. If those husbands don't limit romance to one day per year they shouldn't look bad.\n\n4. What did the sisters get / do for their husbands? If they didn't get or do anything they shouldn't expect anything in return. Are they even upset? You've only mentioned the husbands and your gf's parents.\n\n5. Your gf's parents should stay out of this. It has nothing to do with them and they're just contributing to unnecessary drama.\n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don\u2019t expect anything from him.  He does things for me the sets the bar high. Like today there is frost on the windows of my car, he has already scraped it for me. But when he gets up earlier than me I find my lunch made for me (he doesn\u2019t even take lunch work). He will bring my coffee to me when I am getting ready for work. That means more to me than roses", "NTA OP.  Your sisters in law seem to be jealous.", "NTA HE made himself look bad, you just made yourself look good.", "NTA They didn't look bad because you got soo much, they looked bad because they did nothing.\n\nZero.   \n\nThey are bad husband's and that's not your fault or problem.    \n\nIf everyone else wants to enable that again not your problem.", "NTA. Has everyone lost their marbles ?", "And then the situation happens again and he sends 12 dozen by accident.\n\nEventually his GF will be crushed under the weight of the hundreds of thousands of roses delivered to her because of FedEx's ineptitude.", "OP could send the two husbands a dozen roses each as an apology, it would be the thoughtful thing to do", "NTA\n\nWhile I appreciate flowers, I always preferred to get just one specifically chosen one (I'm partial to Gerbera daisies) than a full bouquet.\nI couldn't care less if my sister got 3 dozen roses unless she expected me to find vases for them! I would be happy for her and JUST as thrilled with my lone daisy.\n\nI don't think it's about money... It's about trying/effort. Or it should be anyway.\nThey could've done something special, and the fact that they are physically there should count more than a gift if done right.\n\nThe fact that they are blaming you instead of upping their game? THEIR PROBLEM. \nDo give them a heads up next time though if you are spending some holiday together.", "\"Four of them are jealous and stole flowers not meant for them\"\n\nWe don't know that the sisters stole the flowers. It sounds like the GF willingly shared her *six dozen\" bouquets with her sisters who's jerk husband's either half-assed or didn't bother at all. There is no indication the SIL's were assholes here.", "Yep\n\nIt's funny seeing everyone say the husbands are shitty when their wives didn't get them anything either. Last I checked doing nice things for your partner on valentines isn't gendered.", "Exactly! I got a \u00a35 bouquet of tulips from my husband but they are in pride of place in our bedroom and I love them! Tulips are my absolute fave and I love that he knows that. \nI bought him a new set of darts from eBay - cost about \u00a34- he was over the moon as he lost his old set during our move. \n\nIt\u2019s like you say - not the cost but the meaning and thought behind it. \nI\u2019m still smiling at tulips \ud83d\udc90 right now!", "That's the issue here. My brother can afford to buy my sister in law much more expensive gifts than my husband can buy me. I'm not bothered by it though, because my husband still buys me thoughtful gifts within our price range - he's put the thought and effort in, which is what's important. With OP it's not even about the monetary cost of 3 (or 6) dozen roses - it's a sweet in joke with meaning attached to it.", "Yup! My husband always gets me chocolate covered strawberries, any amount is appreciated because I love them.\n\nI always get him his favorite small cake, Boston cream, that he doesn\u2019t have to share because his birthday is on the 13th", "Heck, my mom was satisfied (if a bit annoyed and exasperated at dad's total lack of romance) when dad got her new tires for Valentines day when I was a kid.", "What did the wives do for them though? \n\nI don't see why doing something nice on valentines day is limited to men.", "Sounds like those husbands made 0 effort.", "OP next year:   \n   \nJust give me all the roses you have. Wait, wait. I'm worried what you just heard was, \u201cGive me a lot of roses.\u201d What I said was, \u201cGive me all the roses you have.\u201d Do you understand?", "ou sound like an amazing partner, and a great relationship with your girlfriend. Ignore this nonsense.", "\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f Perfect .", ">Saying \"Don't be too good to your partner or else you're weak\" is just ridiculous.\n\nI didn't say that.  If you try too hard, it is VIEWED as weakness by women...and that bores them.  I wouldn't call any man weak for trying to please his partner.   But I'm not a woman, so I don't think like a woman.", "It is absolutely not this way. Perhaps it is with some very specific bad people, but not a general rule.  If you are consistently meeting women who think this way, adjust the demographic you are seeking.", "Reality can be hard to comprehend sometimes.  Don't feel bad.  You'll catch up to it eventually.", "This is such a r/seducingwomen comment"]}
