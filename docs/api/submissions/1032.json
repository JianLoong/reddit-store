Needless to say, the class is incredibly tough. Luckily though, I have been studying since day 1 so I am doing alright in the class. I am taking the class with a group of friends, so to help them out, I shared the personal notes that I take in class with them via a google doc, and I encouraged them to invite anyone they know. \n\nRecently, one of my friends invited a friend of theirs, let's call her Jess(20F), who i've never really interacted with, but I have a massive crush on. I think she and I would make a great couple, but she's not really into sensitive smart guys, because on her Instagram, I see all her stories show her out with really jock-like men.\n\nOur third exam is in a couple of days, and as I was going through the google doc, I realized that she was using my doc the most. You can see who looks at or edits the doc on google docs, and most of my other friends would pop up sometimes, but I would see her icon pop up alot. I also know for a fact that she isn't doing well in the class, so I got a really good idea. I would put subtle mistakes in the doc so that she wouldn't do well in the exam, and then I can offer to tutor her. That way, I can interact with her and talk to her, so that she'll realize that I have a great personality, and we can hopefully go out together.\n\nI told my friend about this plan, and they called me an \"incel AH\". Personally, I think they're overreacting, because Jess isn't going to do well either way, even if I don't put mistakes, so my plan will actually benefit her grades, while also allowing me to interact with her and talk to her. I think it's a win win for everyone, but I was wondering if my friend may have been on to something, so AITA?", "created_utc": 1667493111, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yl7cqe/aita_for_putting_mistakes_in_my_shared_google_doc/", "score": 2300, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Women don\u2019t owe you a damn thing, and instead of demanding one woman be with you because \u201cyou know you would make a great couple\u201d go find someone to talk to who actually has similar interests. I LOVE Star Wars, and always felt I had to hide that to be cool enough for girls to find me attractive. My partner of 6 years gushes over how nerdy I get about Star Wars, and I can\u2019t believe how lucky I am to be with such a smart, funny, attractive, caring woman. \n\nThere is someone out there for you, and probably several someone\u2019s along the way to hep you learn what you are actually attracted to, but you\u2019re not gonna find them trying to manipulate someone into being with you.

Tell her that you had learned of her from a mutual friend and then noticed that she was an active user of your google docs for this crazy difficult chem class you are both taking.

It just might work!", "YTA for saying that she doesn't like sensitive smart guys because the guys she dates are athletic looking. Do you really think that athletic looking guys can't be sensitive and smart? You really think that there are any women who think to themselves \" Oh yeah I definitely want a guy who's not sensitive and smart, those things are not my style.\" Like of course every woman wants to date someone who is sensitive and smart. They just ALSO want to date someone who is hot. And there are people out there who are sensitive, smart, and hot. Like this is the equivalent of saying that women are attracted to assholes. They're not attracted to assholes, they are attracted to guys who have qualities that they're looking for and they may be over willing to look one or two traits of the guy is offering up more of her ideal package than not. No woman is seeking an asshole because women aren't stupid. Anyone who makes the claim about women being attracted to assholes, or women not liking guys who are smart and sensitive, is basically calling that woman stupid. Being smart is an objectively good trait. Obviously she wants to date someone smart. So if she's rejecting you, it's not because you're smart. It's because she's not into you for other reasons. \n\nAlso, your entire plan is psychotic and I think that it's probably fake, but I still wrote my diatribe in hopes that there's some other person  out there who needs to hear it.

That isn't a reputation you want to get, as it can very quickly make you a pariah among both your classmates and the faculty.", "There are enough people explaining why YTA because of how messed up your plan is just on face value, but here's what I want to know: what happens if your 'genius' (read: creepy and manipulative) plan fails? \n\nWhat if you do all this, and tutor her for a few sessions, ask her out, and she rejects you? Are you going to quit tutoring her? Because now you've tanked her grade and are leaving her floundering all because she doesn't like you back. And don't say that it doesn't matter because her grades aren't good anyway. If her grades really were that bad, you wouldn't have to resort to literal sabotage.\n\nAnd even if you do offer to continue tutoring her, you've now put her in the incredibly awkward and uncomfortable situation of needing to maintain contact with someone you've rejected. Not to mention, given the frankly extreme lengths you're prepared to go to just to set up an opportunity to interact with her, I highly doubt you'd be able to put your feelings aside to continue tutoring her without expecting something in return. Which means, again, you've now tanked her grades just because she doesn't like you back.\n\nYou've said in some of the comments that you really do love her, that this isn't just you trying to sleep with her because you think she's hot. If that's true, an important part of truly loving someone is genuinely caring for their well-being. Being willing to purposefully lower someone's grades because they rejected you (which is almost certainly what will happen if she doesn't like you back) is not looking out for their well-being. It's the opposite of that. \n\nSo if you actually do care about Jess in any way, and aren't just being creepy and selfish, this plan is a truly awful way of expressing that. Maybe spend some time thinking about what love actually is before you try coming up with any more schemes to get yourself a girlfriend.

Needless to say, the class is incredibly tough. Luckily though, I have been studying since day 1 so I am doing alright in the class. I am taking the class with a group of friends, so to help them out, I shared the personal notes that I take in class with them via a google doc, and I encouraged them to invite anyone they know. \n\nRecently, one of my friends invited a friend of theirs, let's call her Jess(20F), who i've never really interacted with, but I have a massive crush on. I think she and I would make a great couple, but she's not really into sensitive smart guys, because on her Instagram, I see all her stories show her out with really jock-like men.\n\nOur third exam is in a couple of days, and as I was going through the google doc, I realized that she was using my doc the most. You can see who looks at or edits the doc on google docs, and most of my other friends would pop up sometimes, but I would see her icon pop up alot. I also know for a fact that she isn't doing well in the class, so I got a really good idea. I would put subtle mistakes in the doc so that she wouldn't do well in the exam, and then I can offer to tutor her. That way, I can interact with her and talk to her, so that she'll realize that I have a great personality, and we can hopefully go out together.\n\nI told my friend about this plan, and they called me an \"incel AH\". Personally, I think they're overreacting, because Jess isn't going to do well either way, even if I don't put mistakes, so my plan will actually benefit her grades, while also allowing me to interact with her and talk to her. I think it's a win win for everyone, but I was wondering if my friend may have been on to something, so AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You'd be effectively shooting yourself in the foot. Don't do it.\n\nI'm sorry but the mindset you have kiiind of does sound like an incel's. Just.. A bit. Because I don't have the full context here I'm not going to assume but I am gonna have to say your friend is right, it sounds really bad and if Jessica finds out that you're gonna do this/have done this, she's going to find that super creepy and avoid you like the plague.

I'd had a crush on him off and on over the years, but also took zero shit from him. I knew he was smart. Clint was also smart, just a stoner who I'm pretty sure had undiagnosed ADHD (turns out I did, too, lol).
