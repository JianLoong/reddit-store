I've had several miscarriages myself and while I mourn the loss, it doesn't control my life. For the simple fact that life goes on, even when something you love dies. Living in the past or dwelling on what could've been just makes you lose out on what's there. Which is what your adoptive mother has done. She's grieved for so long that she doesn't see what's right in front of her: a daughter and a grandson that need her way more than her deceased child ever could. And if she's not careful, she'll lose that too. For which I would not blame you in the least.", "NTA. Everyone is entitled to grieve for a loved one, but your mom is obsessed with grieving for the baby she miscarried *over 40 years ago*. I was in my teens when I found out that my mother miscarried my parent\u2019s first baby and third baby (overheard my dad say something so I asked my mom about it). I can\u2019t imagine what it would\u2019ve been like to grow up being dragged to their grave sites. If your mother is still full of sorrow, she needs grief counseling, but you are right to limit your son\u2019s exposure to her obsession.", "My parents told me recently that mom had a few miscarriages before they had my youngest brother.\n\nI'm 34.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, your mother needs therapy and you need to set solid boundaries.

My wife (and I) had an MC last year and she is pregnant again now. It\u2019s been really hard, this whole process has been wonderful but also awful. While I understand (generally) the trauma that comes with a MC, what she\u2019s done to you is inexcusable imo. You were her rainbow baby, as mine is now, she should have treated you like the miracle you are, and that she chose (considering you were adopted). Instead you\u2019ve endured a life time of trauma dumping and now she\u2019s trying to normalize it with your kid too? I\u2019m sorry, but no. Fetch will never be a thing and neither will this. Good on you for setting the boundary. TBH this is pretty fucked imo. Parents should never subject their children or grandchildren to their trauma. All people need therapy, but she needs it extra.", "NTA - OMG. That's disturbing", "I mean you're the parent at the end of the day and she needs to respect that but people like you create adults who are fucking terrified of death.\n\nIt sounds like you're just super bitter about your childhood and need some therapy", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Losing a baby at whatever stage is just so devastating. \n\nBut yeah she's not handling it appropriately. It sucks she made you feel like a back up/replacement. And she should have at least told you her plan rather than just taking your kid. She needs therapy in a major way and it's not your job to cater to her issues.", "NTA. This is just weird. I get that people grieve in their own way, but to carry that on and introduce others to I guess force them to share in your grief is strange to me.", "NTA for limiting exposure of your son to your mother's obsession.  Destroying one childhood over a miscarriage was one too many. Sorry you went through that, OP", "NTA. I lost my first in my second trimester, and after discussing it with my therapist, agreed I would not tell my daughter about it until she is old enough to process it. It\u2019s a burden no child should bear if they don\u2019t have to, and I\u2019m sorry your mother placed that on your shoulders. Good for you for protecting your son.", "NTA - your son is not her therapist. It\u2019s EXTREMELY inappropriate for her to take a five year old to a grave and unload like that.", "NTA. Gracious, I hope you have a therapist to talk to about all that because what your mom did is no way to raise a child.  And absolutely tell her not to talk to your son about it. It would be one thing if she were just generally discussing a relative that passed. But she\u2019s not doing that and you can\u2019t trust her.", "NTA.   This is inappropriate at that age.", "NTA your mom needs serious mental help to be dwelling on this over 30 years. I'd be cutting her contact with her grandson if she keeps this up", "NTA.  You mother cannot spend her life passing her loss, trauma and grief onto each successive generation.  This must stop with you.", "NTA.  Do let your mom be around your son alone.  this may be a good time to go low contact with her until your son is an adult and better equipped to deal with broken personalities.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m adopted as well and what your mom did is horrible. Now it seems she\u2019s trying to involve your child and it seems like it\u2019s for attention since you\u2019re not in her home anymore and everyone else has stopped with the \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2019s\u201d long ago.\n\nYour son does need to learn about death but in an appropriate way. Not from grandma talking about her dead babies to him forcefully (since as a 5 year old he can\u2019t choose not to go where grandma wants him to all that well).", "NTA. Your mom has some issues she needs help to resolve. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s normal or healthy behavior on her part. I\u2019d be very hesitant to leave a child alone with her though, she doesn\u2019t seem to have any respect for you as a human being, much less as her child. I\u2019m sorry you had to deal with that all your life.", "NTA Your mum spent years trauma dumping on you and now she is trying to do it to your son. Your 5 yr old is not her therapist.", "NTA!! First and foremost, 5 is a bit early to start talking about dead people he's never met. Second, and as important, YOU are the parent, SHE is GrandMa; babysit and spoil the child, but she does NOT get to decide when kid is ready for different benchmarks in growing up. Bottom line is, YOUR child, YOUR rules. If she doesn't agree, she doesn't get to be alone with him.", "NTA. Your mother has unresolved trauma. As a fellow adoptee, I'm really sorry you had to grow up with this dysfunction, which sounds like it resulted in your own trauma. You can break the cycle *right now* by limiting your child's contact with your mother and always supervising. Sending you the best.", "How so? I'd argue this has the opposite effect for a kid that age", "He has had family members die. Like actual ones that lived actual lives. This is a miscarriage that happened 30 years ago, and honestly it shouldn\u2019t be something he has to hear about.", "Normalize death at a young age. The more you avoid it the more the adult child won't know how to handle it later on.", "Now you're just invalidating you mom's grief.", "You don't need to have miscarriages explained to you at 5 years old in order to successfully cope with the topic of death as an adult.", "It's a 5 year old and a miscarriage, not a kid with a dead fish. This isn't avoiding death, it's refusing to engage a kid who is too young in a very specific, complicated situation involving death, one that would be more confusing and frightening than educational", "Oh my god. I had death normalized for me at a young age. I was 3 when my grandfather died, 6 when my cousin died, and at 10 I was told both my grandmothers had Alzheimer\u2019s and would die soon. And you know what that didn\u2019t do? Help me handle death as I\u2019ve gotten older. If anything, it\u2019s made me much more aware of death and fearful of what happens to those we leave behind. So, please, cool it with these blanket statements", "We\u2019re talking about a 5yo here! Her son will learn about death in due time. I had no concept of death until like 8/9 (when my first grandfather passed), and I\u2019m certainly not terrified of death now. You\u2019re speaking in such absolutes, it\u2019s insane. No need to be telling 5yo about dead fetuses imo. OP, you\u2019re NTA!", "I cannot tell you how much I don\u2019t care. I had to console that woman about it for 18 years.", "YTA - so glad your son already knows about it :)"]}
