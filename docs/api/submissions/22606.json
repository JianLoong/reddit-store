First, five is WAY too young for that. Second, taking them to the grave is a little too much, especially as a little kid. If your kid is interested in going when they are a mature teen or adult and can understand and consent to that experience, fine, but it needs to be your informed child\u2019s choice, not something pushed on them when they are too young to understand existential dread and death properly. \n\nTo be honest, your mom sounds like someone trying desperately to keep her stillbirth/miscarriage\u2019s memory alive by forcing sadness and turmoil on you and your loved ones. She is feeding her own regrets your grief and pity; she needs to learn to let go. If she can\u2019t let go, she needs to learn to grieve healthily without inflicting pain on others.  \n\nPlease set boundaries for the sake of your child and yourself.

My pain is for me to hold and take care of, but when it comes to my daughter I will protect her. If she does want to know about my twins, I'll tell her and how I felt and how I was so happy that she came to be. But I won't make her feel like a third child, she is my first living and unfortunately as terrible as it sounds, she is here to feel and they are not. I have nothing to provide to them besides the love I'll always have for them, but to her I will have to provide the sense and the true feeling that I love her as my first. My mother had a daughter before me who died of SIDS at 3mo. She never explicitly told me as a child until I asked about her baby photo on the wall, and she and my grandma explained to me who it was and what happened. In a child friendly way.

You don't attend funerals for the dead because they are conscious of nothing and peacefully sleeping. You go to funerals for the ones mourning and sometimes the grief never ends. And some don't have the option of adoption because it's expensive and a grueling process for families.  To me you sound bitchy and lack empathy but you need to get on top of this instead of resenting your Mother for something YOU obviously never made her aware of. That's not fair and doesn't seem loving.  That's just me though and I hardly think your Mother thought of you as a consolation prize, she more likely just wanted to be a Mother and was trying to show you, you could have had a sister.

She is overstepping and your 5 year old is not going to understand how an unborn baby is his aunt.\n\nBut my ruling is a soft ESH simply because of how you\u2019ve addressed it here. Your mom should have gotten therapy for her loss and should not have adopted if she couldn\u2019t treat you as your own person and not just the consolation prize. She was absolutely an AH for making a child leave her favorite toy at a grave where it would just get dirty and thrown away by the groundskeeper. If she wanted you to have a connection to your sister, she should made visiting optional and talked about how special you are and asked if you\u2019d like to get flowers or a trinket to put on the grave, but not something you cherished! She is definitely the bigger AH in this situation.\n\nBut also, you\u2019re a bit of an AH for referring to her baby and your sister as \u201cthe fetus\u201d. I get that you have a lot of resentment because of your mom\u2019s behavior, but by twenty weeks, the baby is just shy of viable. That loss is very painful. She will never not grieve the loss, but she should have learned to deal with it in a healthier way. Still though, to her \u201cthe fetus\u201d is her other daughter, her baby who died too soon. Calling her just \u201cthe fetus\u201d is dismissive.\n\nI say this as someone who has lost two- a miscarriage and a stillbirth. I will never not mourn their loss, but I learned to live with it and still have a happy, full life. My kids know about both their siblings. Everyone I know who had later miscarriages or stillbirths do the same with their kids. However we do not make our living kids feel like consolation prizes or after thoughts. We do not make our living kids leave gifts for our deceased kids. I have four living kids- two older than my lost babies and two younger. The grave is in another state. When we are there, we do stop to visit and bring flowers. I was there last week for the first time in a couple years, visiting my in-laws. The stone was a little dirty so I planned to go back later in the week to clean it. My two younger kids decided to come help and they had fun scrubbing the letters with toothbrushes (my youngest is 6). This was optional for them- they could have stayed with their grandparents, but they wanted to help. They sometimes ask questions about the babies and I answer them as best I can. They know I love all 6 of my kids- two of them just aren\u2019t here. The last two might not have ever been conceived if the other two lived- who knows what could have happened with different circumstances? But they are not consolation prizes or replacements. They are their own people with their own stories and I love them just as much as if they had been the first ones or if I\u2019d had no losses. \n\nSo while I understand the frustration you\u2019re feeling and fully agree with you enforcing this boundary for your son, I also have a small amount of empathy for your mom.

I found funeral homes to be wonderful places to explore, I  found the smells of the flowers and incense a little overwhelming, and I remember being somewhat shocked by how much *less* wrinkled my 92 year old great grandmother looked in her casket than she looked when I knew her.

It's like the grief didn't get smaller, but that everything else in their life got fuller over the years with everything else they experienced. \n\nMy view is that in this case it isn't so much about the mum \"being over\" the miscarriage/stillbirth, that she should've forgotten it'd happened, gone back to who she was before and see it as no more than just a small bump in the road. Also, in general I think it's often a good thing for kids to be aware of lost siblings and know of many parents who handle this in appropriate ways. \n\nBut in this situation the mother seems to have almost weaponised it and held the baby she lost above the needs of the child she was raising. \n\nThe way it was written makes me wonder if this perhaps wasn't the only aspect of OPs upbringing that was, say, less than ideal. \n\nI once knew someone who's mum would quite frequently and explicitly discuss their miscarriage them from when they were young in a rather trauma dumping, parentefying way. I'm not sure if, had it been just that, it would've seemed just a little off and overshare-y rather than full on nope, but considering this was only one of the many aspects of an abusive upbringing it was very much full on nope.", "I would say there is \"getting over it\", and there is \"moving on\".  \n  The former implies to stop letting the problem in your life. This is more appropriate for something like dropping your Nintendo switch or your dog eating your favourite shoes, not the grief associated with a miscarriage.   \n  \n\"Moving on\" means learning to deal with the grief from a major loss or change in your life and learning to try and function in that new normal. This includes things like divorce or a death of a close friend or relative, even if you were only just starting to know them, like in this situation.  \n  \nI couldn't imagine what it would be like to bury one of my children and I hope it is something I and my wife never ever have to do.", "I am so sorry that happened to you and your husband i am happy to know that yall are thriving.

I wish people would take time to really think things through and understand that the child is a person and not just an object they are obtaining. \n\nAfter suffering a loss people need time to truly grieve without rushing into adopting a \u201creplacement\u201d child. \nWhen a romantic relationship ends most people give themselves time to get over it before they actively seek out a new relationship, the same attitude should be applied for adopting- especially as a parent child relationship is for life. \n\nI can\u2019t have children and considered fostering or adopting at one point, it took me time to realise that I was doing it for the wrong reasons. My desperation for a child was because I felt pressured by other people into having children. I was constantly asked why me and my partner had none and felt excluded when my friends and family were all having kids around me. \nI felt faulty and less of a woman every time I got the sympathetic nod and pat on the arm and told \u201coh don\u2019t worry you\u2019ve plenty of time, I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll happen for you.\u201d\nThe expectations from people weighed heavily on me until I took time out to question what I really wanted and my reasons for considering adoption. \n\nI\u2019m so glad I didn\u2019t rush into things because I now know it would have been the wrong decision. \nI\u2019d had no experience with kids until my friends started having them and then my niece was born and suddenly there were babies everywhere! \nIt took spending time with them to realise how difficult having babies and bringing up children actually is. \nI watched friends lives change and seeing them always exhausted and desperate for someone to take their kids off their hands for a few hours just so they could have a short break. \nWhilst they argued over bedtime I travelled and partied and had a spotless house and lots of sleep.\n\nI\u2019m currently happily child free and sat on a beach in an adults only 5 star resort drinking Prosecco. I just spoke to my best friend who told me that she was hiding in the toilet for 5 minutes peace. \n\nI\u2019m not saying adoption is a bad idea for everyone, I\u2019m sure the majority of people give the child a happy home and they are well loved. \nIt\u2019s just sad that some people jump into it without truly knowing what a commitment it is. So many people are desperate for a baby but don\u2019t think past the baby stage and forget they are raising another human for life. \n\nI think everyone having children (biologically or adopted) needs to really consider their reasons behind the desire to start a family.

For example I showed my oldest the house she was brought home to as a baby, she asked if that was where I was also pregnant with the twins, I said yes and moved on.\n\nI think as a culture we should normalize talking about pregnancy loss, but that is very different than the trauma OPs mom inflicted on her.", "NTA and what this person said. Mom needs an ultimatum: Get therapy or we cut contact.", "My grandma mourned her dead child until she died. He died around 6 months old. She convinced my mum to name my younger brother after him. The older she got, the more stories she'd make up about him, she cut a photo of a man out of a magazine and said that's how she imagined him to look like, and put it in a frame, she made up a person in her mind like he was still alive and grown up. I can only imagine the pain, but she clearly couldn't deal with it and it added to all the mental health issues she experimented her whole life.", "I so agree with you, children are very matter of fact and accepting about death- it doesn\u2019t need to be shrouded in secrecy like something shameful happened.", "\n>the bit about the stuffed rabbit lowkey fucked me up\n\n\nes that was so cruel. It reminds me of some actions by my mother who is a diagnosed narcissist (not a word in the air, she was disgnosed by one of the most prominent psychiatrists in town). She told me subreptitiously, she must have felt kind of proud to be so special a case. She had previously said that she needed the most specialized and competent therapist because her case was so unusual and extraordinary. Anyway, she didn't go see the guy for very long. Not gratifying enough I guess. \n\nAnyway when I was about 2 1/2 she threw everything I had, every few toys and stuffed animals in the garbage because my sister argued with me about one little beige plush dog. Then I never had any toys for my entire childhood. \n\nWhen I was in 11 my father, who was very absent, brought me to a store to buy me a stuffed toy. I was completely frozen and couldn't choose. I received my first and doll for Christmas I think I was 12. I remember going once to the room my 2 sisters shared and where I was not supposed to go, so excluded I was from the family, and there was a row of dolls and stuffed toys on 3 sides of their bunk beds. They had what looked like huge drawers full of games. \n\nI recently had gotten some Lego in a fruitcake tin and a game of 1000 Bornes when I was over 10. Some people, probably my grandparents must have realized at some point that I had nothing. All of this because I was my mom's scapegoat. \n\nSo yes, being forced to give up one's beloved toy to the tomb of a dead child must be very scarring and cause huge lasting pain. That's far from normal and very abusive.", "Seriously. Her wanting to grieve and visit the grave regularly is one thing, but forcing the replacement kid to give up a favorite toy for a grave is INSANE. \n\nOP\u2019s mom needs therapy and OP probably does as well, but may have a shot at saving her own kid from a big therapy bill by keeping grandma from using him as a trauma dumping ground.\n\nAnd of course OP is NTA.", "The stuffed rabbit part made me so sad!", "Five is fine, I would say 3 or 4 is fine as well if it\u2019s an appropriate conversation about a dead loved one or animal and not \u201cI had you only because my daughter died and you need to give her grave your favorite stuffed animal.\u201d I know people with dead children who incorporate their dead child in their living children\u2019s lives, even if they never met. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an inappropriate way to grieve as long as the child feels comfortable voicing their feelings about it and isn\u2019t made to feel second place.", "I'm a rainbow. I honestly can't remember when my mom first told me she miscarried before me, but that was because she treated it very matter-of-factly.\n\nObviously everyone and their experience is different, but I think that because she never treated it as taboo or traumatic it was never a big deal to me.", "Just remember that there is a VAST difference between letting your kids know...and trauma-dumping on them. \n\nIMHO, you shouldn't hide the facts from them, but you should also be very aware of things you might be doing because of that history and try to keep it within reasonable limits. Being over-protective, for example. \n\nAnd, it likely goes without saying, but I'm going to say it anyway...never, ever, *EVER* make any sort of comparison between your living child and the miscarried one(s). You can't know if the comparison would even be true - and it's the most hurtful thing you could do to compare someone to a perfect ghost in someone's head that they can never 'beat' because the ghost will *always* be 'perfect' and a real, live human being cannot be.", "I totally agree, that is definitely the vibe I was getting from the post too. The Mom is clearly unhealthily obsessed and it has become incredibly damaging to those around her. It sounds like she never got the help she needed and instead adopted thinking it would fix all her problems and resents the fact that it fixed nothing. She\u2019s been broadcasting that resentment ever since. I would not trust her not to continue that behaviour towards the grandson. Learning about death or visiting a gravesite is not the issue, it\u2019s everything else she\u2019s been doing since OP was a child.", "Shit like that makes me want to throw hands.", "My grandma lost a baby shortly after birth and my aunt is a rainbow baby. She thinks of her sister as her guardian angel of a sort, as well. \n\nAs the grandchild, I don't suppose I knew about the story until I was in my late teens or early 20s (perhaps not until after grandma passed, even). I think because they didn't want me asking grandma questions. It was a complicated, tragic story.", "I\u2019m also adopted, I know without a doubt that I was so very loved and wanted! When I read stories like the OP\u2019s and others it breaks my heart", "My body remembers.  It is odd to read this post on this week, because it marks 18 years since my girls died.  And I am sad, I often don\u2019t realize why I am sad until I realize the dates.  My husband knows, but no one else does.  I realize what it is, put on a happy face for a day or two and then I really am fine.\n\nBut it is interesting to me that my body remembers before my conscious brain does.\n\nFor those out there who experienced a recent loss, someone who loved me found a grief counselor who had experience working with parents who experienced this type of loss.  It is not hyperbole to say that both the counselor and my friend may have saved my life.\n\nAnd if you are hurting right now from a recent loss, it gets better, I promise, but you need to do some work.  Therapy, honesty and to engage with the living.", "I\u2019ve miscarried and read an article shortly after that referred to miscarriage as the death of hope. That made and makes so much sense to me.", "That's ridiculous. Neither of those matter.", "That's a cold take. Grandma needs help, but to say the baby never existed is ridiculous. Women who lose their fetus lose their BABY. They lose the hope of life that was growing inside. \n\nDon't be so callous.", "\u201cWhat is innapropriate\u201d also includes the woman bringing her grandchild to the grave at such a young age without his mothers consent. \n\nThis woman has selfish reasons to go and therefore does not need to bring this child. Based on history, I believe she likely doesn\u2019t understand that. But she needs to go alone or invite someone old enough to understand & consent. I hope she respects her daughter\u2019s wishes and boundaries on this.", "Because children aren't actually people to them. They're a milestone and something to be acquired because \"it's just what you do\".  And they get to martyr themselves the rest of their lives because they saved a child.", "I grew out of it.  But for a while, I'd panic every night that mom was going to die and she'd have to comfort me and tell me she'd be fine.  I'd go sleep in her bed a lot too.  I don't know what triggered it, I was young.", "Ok that\u2019s EXACTLY what happened to me. But that paranoia pointed to a larger pattern of behavior that I only became recently aware of. In case the same fear has presented itself for you in other ways, I wanted to ask if you\u2019re doing ok, in case I can help <3", "There was a tragic accident at the traffic light at one end of my block in 2016. Two girls who were around 8 years old crossed against the light and were hit by a car. One girl survived, one was killed instantly.\n\nThe mother of the girl who was killed still hangs memorial wreaths with purple ribbons in the utility pole at the site of the accident. It's a sad situation, because it's almost directly in front of the home were the other girl lived. That girl had a long and difficult recovery, and will probably walk with a cane for the rest of her life. \n\nShe was also deeply traumatized by seeing her best friend die before her eyes. She was unable to come and go by the front door, and her family had to put that translucent windo contact paper for bathrooms on the front windows. The girls were the same age as my youngest stepdaughter, so even my wife was deeply affected.\n\nThey moved about a year later. There was no bad blood over it; they knew that that intersection would probably be triggering even without the memorial to her dead friend. And as much as they hated seeing their daughter suffer, the two families had been friendly, and they knew how much that woman suffered.", "The rabbit part was a bit heart breaking.", "A neo-natal intensive care nurse once told me that there is a terrible problem when people who lose a child, including to a miscarriage, idealize the lost child as the \"perfect child,\" who never would have given them any of the trouble that their living children do.", "That is batshit crazy. Yes, stillbirth and miscarriages are awful. A friend of mine had to terminate a much-wanted pregnancy because of genetic abnormalities incompatible with life. It was traumatic and haunts her to this day. But. Huge But. She had a son before that and had another baby after. And while she will post stuff about the baby that didn't make it (usually on the anniversary of the termination or the baby's previous due date, or, since we're in the US, she occasionally mentions it online along with championing abortion rights), and her sons know there was a baby in-between them that didn't make it - she's had lots of therapy, and has, seemingly, accepted what happened and moved on with her life. Yes, she probably still grieves to an extent. Obviously she gets sad about it still - who wouldn't - but she doesn't go around photoshopping it into family pictures. That's.... A whole other level of crazy bananapants.", "Damn if this isn\u2019t the mother of all statements! TRAUMA DOES NOT GIVE YOU PERMISSION TO TRAUMATIZE OTHERS!!!!!!! Thank you for saying it!", "That\u2019s how I view it. It\u2019s the potential you mourn. The life and the child you imagined you were going to have. The grief is very real.", "I should have said the way the GRANDMOTHER has fixated on the death. That confuses my point. \n\nPermission needs to be gained from mom to grandma to take the kid ANYWHERE, cemetery included."]}
