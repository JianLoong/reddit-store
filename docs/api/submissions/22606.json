That is some deeply unresolved pain on her part and she's being extremely irresponsible in bringing your young child into her trauma as well.\n\nIt would be one thing to talk about as a whole family sometime, but the fact that she took it on herself to just bring your kid to a graveyard to talk about a miscarriage/stillbirth is unbelievable.", "NTA.

While it seems you don\u2019t care about hurting your mom (no judgement, I couldn\u2019t imagine growing up with that), know that if you speak about this baby using the term fetus in front of those you care about who have a suffered a miscarriage or stillbirth you may or may not be aware has happened, it could very much hurt them.", "Info:  If your son died right now today, in 30 years would you expect no one to mention him ever? \n\nThere is no time limit on grief.

Your particular phrasing suggests you don\u2019t accept this, that you\u2019re inclined to dismiss your mother\u2019s grief. Your mother is entitled to her grief, without a doubt. Whether it is appropriate for your mother to talk about her loss all depends on HOW she talks about it. My four year old knows he has a sister that stopped growing in Mommy\u2019s tummy.

You have a child, you should be a little more understanding/sensitive about this. The way you talk about her pain is cruel.

Therapy might help her realize how (unintentionally) hurtful her actions were toward you over the course of your life, and then she might find more effective ways to channel her grief without hurting you in the process, and maybe therapy could help you forgive her so that at least you\u2019re more at peace about her behaviour whether she changes or not.
