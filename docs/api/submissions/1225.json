It's an old story, and I'm still friends with the guy, we're cool.\n\nYou see, I hate peanuts. Lucky for me, I'm not from the USA, so I don't have to deal with stuff like peanut butter, snickers and Reese's candies on a daily basis like they do. Only within the \"fitness world\". So I'm friends with this guy who's very into sports and fitness (good for him) and a few years ago I was at his house and he offered these oat+peanut cookies. You see, every other time I've told people that I didn't like **X\\*** or any food with 'X', they'd always go with \"Oh but just taste it, it's so good, you'll hardly feel the X in it\" and never take a no until I do eat it (and it always tastes awful).\n\nSo this time, seeing as I had just met him and he wouldn't know about it, at first I said \"no thanks I don't eat peanuts\", and when he went with the old \"you can't hardly taste them\" and all the benefits of it, I said \"yeah but I can't eat it anyway, I'm allergic\". He got really scared, and put the cookies away quickly. After that he asked if there was any danger in me breathing around the peanuts or touching it, and I said I had no problem with it, I'd just feel sick by eating it.\n\nYears passed and we're cool, and since it worked I said the same to other people as well. Except one day we're talking and the food allergy subject came back, when he asked if I ever had to use an epipen before. So I decided to tell him (as we were friends by then) that I'm not really allergic, I was just tired of people insisting on me eating food I didn't like and all. He didn't really get mad, but he told me that it was an AH move to fake a disease like that, that he thought it was serious and always made sure to check if anything he offered me had any peanuts beforehand...as he should, I think?\n\nI really don't think I'm TA because people don't really respect your tastes in food and will keep insisting until you give in.

It's amazing how obnoxiously pushy people can be when they want you to \"just taste something,\" even when you make it clear that you don't like it and know your own mind. The only drawback to what you did was that it will make it harder for other people who actually have allergies to be around these people. They will start sneaking the allergenic food to them to test it. There have to be hundreds of posts like that just on this subreddit. If you don't mind being a little bit crude, I recommend that you simply tell them to fuck off, take their peanuts and put them where the sun don't shine, etc. Be emphatic and push right back at them. Even physically knock the food out of their hand and stomp on it after it hits the floor. I'm sorry you know people like this. The best karma I can think of for them is that their own children one day have severe allergies and they have to be constantly vigilant.", "NTA.\n\nHe\u2019s the one who was planning to not take no for an answer. He should reflect on that before coming for your defence mechanisms.", "YTA. You put people in a position where they are overly vigilant to protect your safety when the reality is you just don't like it. Politely decline the offer. If they insist that you just try a piece, just repeat no thank you. It's not that deep.", "I was full on ready to call you T A, but you didn't make a restaurant full on clean the kitchen like another redditor did and have the parents handed a huge bill for the trouble.\n\nYou need to be firm and say no thank you.  Don't give them any reason. Just no. It's a full sentence. \n\nI hate when people force things on you.  I offer politely but if someone doesn't want my cookie I accept it and move on.  Food relationships are weird for many people. \n\nOfficial Verdict is NTA.", "YTA\nSorry that you\u2019re a picky eater in a world of people with strong opinions about what the best food it. People get dopamine from hailing their own opinions as divine truth. However, dont lie about shit as inane as this. Just draw a line and say, \u201cI dont like that food, Ive tried that flavor before and I dont like it\u201d\n\nAllergies like this are a real issue, just dont lie about things of consequence like life threatening allergies. You put literal fear into someones heart that they could have put you in danger by having peanuts near them, and then now you live rent free in their mind as they plan what they eat when they are around you for your safety.\nYTA 99%", "YTA. You faked an allergy that is lethal to others forcing him to change his entire behavior around you for no real benefit to you other than you wont be annoyed anymore.\n\nYes they're AH's for keeping offering you stuff you don't want but you're on an entire other level.", "YTA. I can understand why you\u2019d choose an easy - but insensitive - answer like that after going through many(?) similar situations before, but your friend had to be on guard at all times since then for any food that he might offer you, for an allergy that didn\u2019t even exist in you.", "Yes YTA. You are a grown ass adult. If you don't like something then don't eat it.", "Absolutely NTA.  I do the same with sea food-  hate everything about it.  I can taste it in fried food that\u2019s had fish cooked in it.  It\u2019s disgusting to me but people ALWAYS want to convince me how wonderful it is.  NO, it\u2019s not for me-all the more for ya\u2019ll.. people look at me like I\u2019ve got a 3rd eyeball when I say I don\u2019t eat fish but when I tell them I\u2019m allergic\u2026. they don\u2019t hesitate to keep it away from me .  Everybody wins.  NTA.", "yes... \n\nHaving an allergy is serious....", "YTA", "Esh\n\nYou are both AH.  Him for forcing food that you don't want on you and you for pretending to have a life threatening allergy to something you just don't like.", "YTA for helping to dilute how seriously allergies are taken.", "Soft esh.  An allergy is pretty serious.\n\nAlthough I totally get what you are talking about.  I am not a huge meat eater but people get offended when I say I don't like say pork chops.  The usual response is you haven't tried the way I make them.  If I reluctantly try them the question is \"its good right?\" No no its not it is pork chops.  They then get offended i don't like their cooking... no I didn't say that I warned you I wasn't a fan of pork chops.  The hurt in their face is real.\n\nHowever, which I did alot as a teen and young adult, if I played the vegetarian card they would say oh thats fine and leave it at that.", "Yes, about that:\n\nI didn't mention in the post as it wasn't relevant, but I'm a vegetarian by choice (ethics). The amount of people I had to cut off of my life because they've tried to prank me into eating meat (like hidding bacon bits in the bean pot)...I feel like if I had told them I had, say, gout or something, they would've think twice.", "Well said. I felt that too but just couldn't find the words.", "I don't think his *entire behavior* revolves around him offering food to people who don't like it, but ok.", "Yeah, I think it's a win-win situation.\n\nI don't get to be rude to people and they don't keep offering (forcing) me their food.\n\nSome people take it as a challenge, even. My mother for example: \"Oh, they don't like X food? That's because they didn't taste MY version of X! I'm going to make it just for them\"."]}
