No way, start having your own holiday!", "NTA but apparently your family are.", "NTA.

That's insane and not relaxing.", "NTA", "NTA Yup have a few staycations until everyone forgets that you can go away for holidays. Once your family get out of the routine of holidaying with you, you might find that the expectation goes away.\n\nBut also I can\u2019t believe you are 24 and still sleeping in the same room as your family when you go away.

It\u2019s ok to tell your mom to stop treat you like a child too.  My son said to me one time when I was going on and on about some safety issue:  mom, you know I\u2019m a grown man, right???  Only had to say it a couple of times.", "Reddit makes me feel so much better about my family.  Once we hit 18, my sibs and I were no longer required to take part in family vacations.

The pestering to wear a dress when you've been clear about not wanting to over and over again stood out to me.

F20 has bowed out of 3 summer holidays so far so she can do her own thing, and m22 has done one long weekend on his own with friends. This is normal. I would never compel them to come on holiday with us, even though I love it when they are there. \n\nAlso, in 2016 my husband and I did a holiday without either of the kids, and it was great, like being back in our 20s again!

She is.  And most moms of 24 YOs kind of expect their kid to go on their own adventures with their friends and not stick with family.  The fact that she's using her emotions to continue to guilt and manipulate you - means you made the right decision to do your own thing.  Vacations are supposed to be where you recharge your own batteries and enjoy your life.  Don't waste vacation days doing something you hate.", "NTA I have the same exact problem. I was guilted into agreeing to a weekend trip coming up next month. I feel your pain", "You\u2019re a grown up.  Vacation where and when you want and with who you want.  NTA.

Sorry mum, I don\u2019t have any leave available to take the family vacation.   Hope you all enjoy yourselves!   Then say nothing.", "NTA you are allowed to make decisions for yourself but a compromise could be just having your own hotel room for privacy and to get away. 24 just seems like a weird age to still be sharing a hotel room with your parents you would think they would want their own freedom and alone time as well. You should do whatever causes you the least amount of anxiety maybe just go and treat yourself to a vacation by yourself just to get away and rest.", "Nta. Just decline and if they want to take it poorly it's on them. You didn't hurt her feelings by doing what's best for you.

On the way home, an older relative decided she would take me home, and I got bitched at for things that happened  when I was a teenager, mostly things that I didn't even do.  I finally had enough and just said that I apologized 25 years ago, and I was done apologizing.
