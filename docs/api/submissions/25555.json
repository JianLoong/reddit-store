Why would you want to subject yourself to trips that you know make you miserable? Tell your mom that it's your decision and you didn't enjoy the past few trips you've been on, and to leave your girlfriend out of it. Their poor behavior is why you've chosen to not attend and instead spend your money and time on something you'd actually enjoy. You don't owe them anything.", "NTA\n\nTime off is limited, and too precious to spend miserable.\n\nIf she isn't getting your \"delicate\" explanation, get blunt. It sounds like a terrible time, and she needs to comprehend that.", "NTA.  You are grown and if you don\u2019t want to go don\u2019t go.  It sounds like Hell.  I work hard for my money and my PTO time is for me to the things I want to do.  \n\nRemember you are not responsible for another adults feelings.  If she cared about your feelings half as much as you care about her feelings this wouldn\u2019t be an issue.", "NTA. Vacations should be fun and enjoyable and relaxing (depending on what you want them to be like). If they aren\u2019t good for you, you aren\u2019t obligated to take them with people who make you have a bad time.", "You are 24 years old. You are certainly old enough to decide when, where, and with whom you'd like to vacation with.  Tell your family you've made other plans and catch up with them at the holidays if you want. NTA", "NTA\n\nEnjoy your holiday away from the family.", "Unless it's a suite, too, it sounds like it's above what most hotels typically allow? I don't know for certain as I don't think I've ever shared one hotel room with more than two other people.", "Ditto - I can count on one hand the number of times I've worn a dress in the last 20 years.", "I\u2019d be more concerned about sharing a room with my family as a 24 year old", "NTA. My husband and I said no more family vacays after several crappy experiences. \n\nYour resources and time are limited, and it's a ridiculous expectation for \"family vacations\" to be expected well into adulthood...especially when you're being asked to foot your part of the bill.\n\nInstead of telling your mom, \"I rather vacation with my GF\" tell her that you have limited time and money for vacations, and have spent the majority of your vacation time with your family up to this point and that you're ready to do something different. Stay strong. Don't let your GF get pulled into this - my husband and I also have a rule that he deals with his family and I deal with mine.", "NTA\nVacations are supposed to be fun. You should be able to relax and do what you want. Forcing yourself to go where you can't even get a good night's sleep is weird to me. I'd have said no to the family vacation and not care who's angry. You're an adult. There's nothing that says you have to go with your family all the time.", "NTA at 24? No way, start having your own holiday!", "NTA but apparently your family are.", "NTA.  You don't need to go on holiday with your family as an adult, and I find it confusing they you'd all be sharing a room.  Why would all of the adults be sharing a room?  That's insane and not relaxing.", "NTA", "NTA Yup have a few staycations until everyone forgets that you can go away for holidays. Once your family get out of the routine of holidaying with you, you might find that the expectation goes away.\n\nBut also I can\u2019t believe you are 24 and still sleeping in the same room as your family when you go away. No wonder you don\u2019t get along with them on holidays! You need your space!", "NTA.  Some people love family vacations, some don\u2019t.  You\u2019re an adult now, I think it\u2019s sweet you are being gentle with your mom, telling her you aren\u2019t going on family vacation anymore.  But you do you.  If you want to stop, stop.  It\u2019s ok to tell your mom to stop treat you like a child too.  My son said to me one time when I was going on and on about some safety issue:  mom, you know I\u2019m a grown man, right???  Only had to say it a couple of times.", "Reddit makes me feel so much better about my family.  Once we hit 18, my sibs and I were no longer required to take part in family vacations.  If they went to somewhere cool, like Disneyland, or went to see our relatives in the Midwest, we might join in, but the last thing my parents wanted was people who didn't want to be there.  They got enough of that when we were kids.", "NTA  You are 24 YEARS old! Stop vacationing with your parents.  It sounds like you don\u2019t enjoy it anyway. If my daughter wanted to go with us when she is an adult, I\u2019ll pay for her. (Currently she is 16 y.o. so she does vacation with us.) At 24 it is time to cut the cord, for both the parents and the now adult kid.", "NTA. \n\nIs it possible your mother is homophobic? The pestering to wear a dress when you've been clear about not wanting to over and over again stood out to me. And now you mom and girlfriend had a falling out... is it because of the vacation or because she is a *girl*friend?", "NTA \n\nAs a parent (f56) I completely accept that my children (m22, f20) are growing out of going on holiday with us. F20 has bowed out of 3 summer holidays so far so she can do her own thing, and m22 has done one long weekend on his own with friends. This is normal. I would never compel them to come on holiday with us, even though I love it when they are there. \n\nAlso, in 2016 my husband and I did a holiday without either of the kids, and it was great, like being back in our 20s again! People grow and change, and the best thing for everyone is to adapt to that, and to take advantage of the opportunities the changes present (like going on holiday as a couple, and not having to please everyone/wait for the teenagers to wake up and only go out in the afternoons!)"]}
