She doesnt have any friends or wants a roommates for her other apartment to share the rent with because she \"can't live with other people\".She have no motivation to find a job,she have worked with us(we work in the same company her brother and me, that's where we have met) for like 2 weeks and I had to \"train her\"(like a person that shows you what to do,how things works,etc.)for that job but she was a manace and I told her I cant deal with her attitude so she quit. She was really bad at it also,my job inquiries speed which she didn't had. Then she starder at a grocery store for like 3 days before they fire her because of the same reasons. She was lazy, wasn't doing her job and stuff. Since that grocery store job (which her brother applied her for because she doesn't even bother to ask or look) she wasn't aible to find anything. 2 weeks have been gone since then. She says she looks online and applying for jobs here and then but im not sure if she is. We don't charge her any money for supplies,bills,rent or whatsoever. But I can't help but feel frustrated by her living with us,having zero motivation to help us or at least give us some space. She sleeps on a couch which is exactly next to our bed and doesnt go out.She's just a kid and I'm probably overreacting but I want to kick her out. Couple of days ago she told me that it would be better to live with us for a longer period of time because she wouldn't be able to pay her bills and rent even if she finds a job.I have talked with my bf couple of times about that situation and he keeps telling me that she's just a kid and I'm expecting too much from her. But there's something about her personality that just bugs me. She doesnt clean,cook,wash the dishes,do the laundry or whatsoever. Even if she have some money she doesnt buy a thing,not even food but always have dinner, lunch with us.Also she keeps taking my clothes and products and even when I ask her to return them she jokingly says \"no,they're mine now\" and keep wearing or using my stuff.I keep telling my bf that she's just 8 years younger that me and it's not fair to give us this princess attitude because when I was her age and just moved into the big city I had to live with a horrible roommates,worked whatever I find(she's picky and delusional about her work options)and genuinely would feel bad if I live in someone's place without helping with the choirs around or money even if it's family. He doesn't get it or seems to be overprotective over her.

Get rid of her. And your bf needs to take this more seriously. This should be something that could end your relationship, since it's showing you where his priorities lie.", "What do you do??? Lol.. get a new boyfriend.  Coz if he can't see what's wrong in this whole set up now then he will never see it anyway. Besides it's 1 sis to put up with now soon enough it will be some other family or friend or whoever and you'll be expected to manage.", "NTA, you\u2019re right that she\u2019s only 19, but you\u2019re not her mom. The least someone can do is help around the house in this situation, and not steal from the people who already live there. I\u2019m questioning your bf\u2019s priorities, but you know the situation better than any random redditor.", "NTA, 19 is perfectly old enough to be getting a job and a place to live. Unless you're still in education that's what 19 year olds do. \n\nYou're not expecting too much of her. She isn't actually a kid anymore, she's nearly out of her teens. She is a young adult and needs to start behaving like one. I wouldn't kick her out straight away but I'd tell her that you're going to start charging rent and if she can't pay she'll have to leave. That'd push her to get a job.", "She\u2019s literally dead weight. Get er outta there by giving her a time and a date", "NTA - The problem is that you haven't given her a FIXED time that she has to be out by.  You said 1-2 month's.  You BF needs to tell his little sister, \"You need to move out by this date\" and then stick with it.  No if's, ands, or buts.  Then tell your BF, you DECIDE who you want to stay, because either she moves out or I do.", "Nta. You're saying she's \"only 19\" but flip that. \"she's 19\"! She's an adult! She needs to get her butt in gear. \n\nShe needs to pull her own weight. Or leave. \n\nTell her she has a month to get a maintain a job, and if she does she can stay one more month to get her money in order to get her own place. If she doesn't have a job in one month she must move out. She likely would be best to move back where she came from. \n\nShe's an adult, she needs to carry herself. \n\nShe also needs to be told to not touch any of your stuff, and if she does she is immediately out.\n\nYour bf is seeing this cloudy as it's his \"little sister\" so he either needs to get on aboard with the above, or you can tell him you'll be finding your own place.", "NTA throw her out.\n\n\nShe's taking advantage of both of you", "Both she and your boyfriend need to move out.", "Nta. She may be a kid, but she's not your kid. It's completely fair you don't want to support her.", "NTA \nTalk to your husband and set your boundaries. Is either her or you. Also set a time frame(like 3 weeks for example) and in the meantime she needs chores at least.

Not saying it is a long term solution, but 'tis the season for seasonal employment to get some cash and experience to start building on.  Hopefully it's just a symptom of being young and inexperienced, but she sounds massively privileged and entitled (though likely not aware of the extent).", "NTA. Sister sounds like a spoiled mooch. She shouldn\u2019t have moved out there if she didn\u2019t have a place or a job, but I\u2019m sure she knew she\u2019d be able to walk all over you and her brother. I\u2019m assuming if you and your boyfriend wanted to have to take care of someone, you\u2019d have a kid or something. I\u2019d speak with boyfriend and if he can\u2019t see that his sister\u2019s a leech, he can go with her.", "Talk with your BF..if she is a kid then she isn't capable of living on her own and needs to go home. If she isn't then she has 3months to find a place and  needs clean\n.if not she goes home\n\nIf not, reevaluate your relationship cause this isn't worth it", "NTA. __Even if__ she was paying rent or bills she is still a nightmare to live with. Just based on her poor attitude she needs to leave ASAP.\n\nIf your boyfriend cares so much then he can pay for __her own__ apartment so that you don't have to needlessly put with her.", "NTA. Your Bf seems to be enabling his sister's behaviour as well. If she's old enough to work she's old enough to pay bills. If she's constantly using your personal items have your bf replace them since she's his responsibility. She's not your child. Even a 10 yr old would know to clean up after themselves. If your bf isn't budging after all your convos with him, then I suggest you find somewhere else you'd be comfortable. I never understood why folks let their \"guests\" make them uncomfortable in their own home. Your boyfriend clearly doesn't see the issues his sister is creating. Red Flag.", "NTA, her brother has to stop being de big brother who protects the little sister. And see the real issue. You guys have to set bondaries and give her a date for her to get out if she doesnt get a Job and Starts helping out. basically, or she does her part and help with chores or she goes Back home.", "NTA. Time for her to go back to her small town. Obviously she isn\u2019t ready to be an adult so she needs to go back home. It\u2019s not your responsibility to support her. I get your bf feels the need but she is just freeloading now.", "NTA. She leaves or you do.", "I she is just a kid, she should be home with her parents.  You are not her parent and did not agree to raise her.  Out she goes. NTA", "She can't live with anyone, yet she is living with you and her brother??", "NTA if she\u2019s not working at all there is no reason she needs to be staying with you, send her back to her parents. Tell your boyfriend if she\u2019s not gone by next week then he can leave with her. It is incredibly rude to except to stay with someone and do nothing! She doesn\u2019t clean up after herself and expects you and your boyfriend to pay for her food! She is not a child, she is an adult!\n\nBut honestly do you want to stay with someone who has no respect whatsoever for you? He had no right to even tell her she could stay with him without talking to you about it first. That is your home! He doesn\u2019t care about you or how you feel at all, he\u2019s always going to put everyone else first because he wants to act like he\u2019s some hero when he is not the one suffering", "NTA. She's not your responsibility. She needs a push...", "If he won\u2019t give her the boot then OP should leave it sounds untenable to me", "Here's the thing. No one ever asked me about that. It's a rented apartment but I was the one who rented it years before we started dating. Then he just told me one day that his little sister is already moving into the same city as us and she will be living with us for month or two. That's what he told me but not sure if that's the same time period he told his sis because she feels comfy af. He's actually a really nice,decent guy,im not sugar coating him, he's so nice and wants to help everyone that will literally give his last money away to a stranger if he has to. So in his defence I can guarantee you that he's just really trying to be there for his little sister but i don't think he's doing her a favour.", "I tried to but things always end up like im the mean and selfish one...even when it comes to choirs...One time after a night shift me and him had she had the audacity to tell us (not ask if,can or whatsoever) to make her a sandwich. I completely lost it and yelled. Her brother got upset and told us to stop fighting and he ended up making her a sandwich. I was so disappointed. Like bruh...", "Well, since you lived there first, Tell him \"I know you are being kind, it is one of the things that I love about you, but this is the date she needs to be out by, if that can't happen, then you both need to be out by that date.\"  \"Your kindness to her, IS NOT showing kindness to me.\"", "If it\u2019s your apartment then either she leaves by herself or he leaves with her.", "So he\u2019s a people pleaser and doormat, now at your expense. Dont do any of her chores. Lock your shit down and yah kick her ass out. She can go back to mommy and daddy. I would check your lease if shes even allowed to stay that long", "Ugh...sounds like they BOTH need some tough love.  BF is not helping her acquire life skills most 19 year olds should already have.", "This isn't a sister problem only it's also a bf problem. I hope you're able to see it. If he isn't able set boundaries and teach her how she is to live in your house then indeed he is encouraging her behavior. She isn't entitled to anything in this house and he needs to realize that. She is getting away with the behavior because he allows it/supports it."]}
