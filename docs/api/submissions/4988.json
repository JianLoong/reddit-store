No brainer.", "I think you hold your mom accountable by what you are currently doing AND not going to her wedding. A lot of these comments are over the top, but they are not wrong in that you shouldn't go to the wedding in support of your wife. I'd definitely have a talk with your mom about how difficult this is for you and how much you love/appreciate her.", "So\u2026your mother expects your wife to get over you soon to be stepdaddy\u2019s ah comments? Reverse the rules\u2014would *you*, OP, tell your mom to get over it if your wife, out loud, said she needed to crop your mom\u2019s smooshed mug out of the picture?", "Your still an ass for even considering treating your life partner like this.", "But the fact of the matter is,he wouldn't have apologized if she didn't hear him say that", "Only because he got caught and he add that he didn't realize she was there. I think the fact is OPs mom didn't defend OPs wife if she had I think this would have been different.", "The context of the fact that he said it so casually and that your mom didn't stick up for your wife herself shows that it's probably not the first time comments of that nature have been made. Your wife deserves a husband that will support her and your mom doesn't really seem like she deserves your attendance as a basic courtesy. Will she even care if you don't go?", "Okay yeah, so that\u2019s called a non-apology. He didn\u2019t really apologize for anything. He refused to accept any of the blame for being mean, rude, snd nasty. I wouldn\u2019t accept it either.\n\nYou can just throw \u201cim sorry\u201d at people and demand they accept it.", "What did your mom say to this comment?", "So you\u2019ll go support a trash human instead?\n\nMake as many excuses as you want for your mom, but supporting one is supporting the other. Look, it\u2019s your marriage. Do what you want. But play stupid games, win stupid prizes. Whatever fallout happens will all be on you. \n\nDon\u2019t play dumb when the consequences come back to bite you in the ass.", "> Worthy of her? Is she some prize?\n\nOh only prizes are worthy things to you? Leave your faux wokeness at the door.\n\n> I think he\u2019s an asshole\n\nSo why are you a) celebrating an assholes wedding, b) not advocating for a better husband other than an asshole.\n\n> even if I hate him\n\nYou're an insane man, I was going to say interesting but I'm not the slightest bit interested in why you'd want to go to the wedding of an asshole you hate.", "He jumped right to that though. This is his default way of speaking about her. You can be in denial all you want and come up with any excuse you want, but he (they) talk about her (and most likely other people, even possibly you) ALL. THE. TIME.\n\nThat's who he is.\n\nWho your mom is, is someone really really happy about being with him\n\nAgain, I would still go to the wedding, but I would start questioning who my mom is vs who I have made her out to be. And then reassess our relationship going forward.\n\nOr just keep on keeping on, I am sure it'll work out great for you.", "Does your mom know he doesn't like you?", "Yep. This is reason enough to blame her as much as her partner.", "Yes I would. I\u2019m not saying this is the healthy approach but tbh my mom wouldn\u2019t care and if she did I\u2019d probably make fun of her for it but that\u2019s just a different dynamic", "Because why would she want a weird picture with half of a christmas display? Also say she did crop it. She couldn\u2019t crop just my wife. She\u2019d have to get rid of me too which would just mean she wanted a picture with her fianc\u00e9", "This is going to be wildly unpopular but they are entitled to their opinion on his wife\u2019s looks. They didn\u2019t say it to her face or insulted her directly, she just happened to overhear them. I get that they\u2019re upset and the guy apologized so whatever. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that huge of a deal for OP to miss his mom\u2019s wedding. Lots of people don\u2019t like who their parent marries for a lot worse reasons and still go to the wedding. NTA.", "I didn\u2019t see it but my wife said she just rolled her eyes", "Even if that was true she couldn\u2019t possibly crop my wife out and not me due to the positions, so what\u2019s wrong with wanting a picture alone with her fianc\u00e9?", "How about tell \"her man\" that he needs to stop saying shit like that about her DIL (and, ideally, about every other person on the face of the earth, but let's start small)?", "Your mom is happy with a man that \u201cconstantly says dumb shit\u201d. If your mom can be with someone who is clearly an AH, it makes one wonder about your mom\u2019s integrity. If my husband said \u201cdumb shit\u201d constantly, I think I would lose respect for him and it would change the way I see him. Being able to put up with that points to your mom actually being ok with the shit he says. Maybe listen to your wife more, before you\u2019re out of her life too.", "Did your mom defend your wife when he made the comment? What has she said to your wife beside to get over it.", "You are showing your wife that you don\u2019t value her.  Don\u2019t be fooled.  Your mother is dismissive of your wife\u2019s feelings.  It probably wasn\u2019t the first time your mother\u2019s fianc\u00e9 said that about your wife\u2014just the first time you and wife heard it.  Your mother and her fianc\u00e9 have probably been having a good laugh about it at your wife\u2019s expense for a long time.  She\u2019s probably relieved that your wife isn\u2019t attending the wedding\u2014she\u2019s got the one person she wants to be there.  She was never concerned about your not coming\u2014she knows her child.", "Umm and? You don\u2019t know that she didn\u2019t want just a picture of her and her fianc\u00e9. You assume she wanted a picture with him, mamma\u2019s boy, and the woman that mamma\u2019s boy doesn\u2019t love enough to support. You sound like someone who  always believed every lie his mom told him. So if your wife\u2019s parents or siblings called you ugly you\u2019d be cool with it and get over it quickly? It wouldn\u2019t bother you at all to know your in-laws think you are too sensitive about being an ugly bull faced person?", "OP, I may be a lone voice here but I think as far as your mum goes, you've done a good job at maintaining a relationship despite her boorish fianc\u00e9.\n\nI understand you wanting to go to her wedding - it's your mum afterall and despite not liking her fianc\u00e9 you say she is happy, so ok.  Besides, she is part of your life.\n\nNow, your wife is right: she is your priority and likewise you should be hers.\n\nMaybe you can have a heart to heart with your wife when things are a bit calmer and discuss it like adults.   It's important that she knows you understand where she's coming from and vice versa.\n\nI think you should try to get your wife's blessing to go to the wedding.  If you don't go, you may have lingering resentment towards your wife and if you go without her blessing she may feel abandoned.\n\nNot an easy situation but try to talk it through without anger on either side and see if you can come to a resolution you can both live with.\n\nNAH except your mum's fianc\u00e9.", "\u2026and attending the wedding supports this union between your mother, who you hold high on a pedestal, and a male creature who has no problem jamming a wedge between her and her family.", "So, she\u2019s a cold person who is marrying an asshole, and you want to support her because you want her to be happy? \n\nYTA", "there\u2019s a difference between an opinion and an insult. insulting someone is not \u201cjust my opinion\u201d it\u2019s a way to hurt someone\u2019s feelings/be mean towards them due to personal reasons. you are entitled to an opinion, you\u2019re not entitled to bully someone because of said opinion. they can find her unattractive without insulting her literal face.", "And do YOU know she hasn\u2019t?", "I didn\u2019t see it but my wife said she just rolled her eyes. To be fair he rants about stupid shit all the time and my mom doesn\u2019t give much of a reaction. She did apologize once and made a comment about she gets it, the world is so mean to women about their looks, but beyond that she seems unable to understand why my wife cares so much", "If she wanted a picture with her fianc\u00e9 why wouldn\u2019t she just ask for one? No one would have been offended. This specific picture would have looked weird if she cropped half the picture and half the display out", "She didn\u2019t that day.

They may not have known she was within earshot, but they knew she was there", "Do you understand why your wife cares this much?", "The fact that his comment didn\u2019t even bother your mother proves that they both say stuff like this about her regularly and that your mother agrees.
