This incident doesn\u2019t end there \n\nYour SFIL also subject to the consequences of his actions.   An apology is not an erase button.  The cruelty of the comment and casual way it was said ( with no reprimand from your mother at the time !!)  destroyed the relationship with your wife.  She has every right not want nothing to do with such bullying and mean behaviour.  \n\nIt\u2019s a rebuild situation not a reset and it can happen when OP\u2019s wife is ready.   If she never is\u2026 so be it.", "Very well said.", "I know. I don\u2019t get all the YTA posts. People act like people don\u2019t talk shit all the time about anything. The wife needs to grow up and get over it. They never intended for his wife to hear and be insulted. Part of a crime is intent and there was no intent here to cause harm to the wife.", "I agree. NTA. It\u2019s a shitty thing to say about someone for sure but it\u2019s not the end of the world. He seems to comply with everything his wife has asked for him up until this request. It\u2019s his mother\u2019s wedding day and he has the right to be there for his mother.  I would feel the same way as his wife about not wanting to be around this AH at all but I wouldn\u2019t stop my husband for being there for his mom.", "I chuckled a bit.  Then felt shitty for chuckling.", "> She has implied this is ridiculous and my wife needs to get over it. \n\nThat actually says a lot about your mother.

Him being allowed to be around your children? \n\nI hate people who comment on other peoples looks. No comment on someone\u2019s looks are necessary even if the person is not around. He is a disgusting human and you are supporting your mother marry a disgusting human by showing up.", "I was wavering if you are the AH in this scenario, but your comment here cements that YTA. \n\nYou\u2019re painting your wife as the problem and your stepdaddy as \u201cwanting to play nice\u201d and your mommy as the victim. \n\nYour stepfather said something incredibly cruel about your wife. Your wife doesn\u2019t have to accept his \u201capology.\u201d I\u2019m guessing he only \u201capologized\u201d because he was caught and told to do so. That\u2019s never an apology. That\u2019s \u201cget my ass out of hot water language.\u201d  \n\nYour mother stood by and allowed him to be cruel to your wife without challenge. If I were your wife, that would be the biggest issue for me. \n\nAnd you seem\u2026\u2026ambivalent about it all?

There's a lot missing here but your wife does not have to forgive especially if she feels it isn't sincere and ESPECIALLY if his rebuttal was \"i DiDN't KnOW SHe wAs ThErE\". It reads (your post) that your mom agrees and talk often to her partner belittling your wife although this is an assumption.\n\nWhen your mom visits is she cold to your wife?

The thing is, you ARE that type of trash human for not having your wife's back.
