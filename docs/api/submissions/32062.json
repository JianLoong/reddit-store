They may be \"her pictures\"\u2014 as in, she took them and has them saved\u2014 but they are still pictures which prominently feature you, and you have a right to dictate where your likeness is used online.\n\nThe thing is, it isn't \"only a photo\", it's a lack of respect for your boundaries. You made a simple request of her regarding something you're self-conscious about and she ignored it, ignored your response to her actions, ignored your feelings about it, and ignored your second request. Even if she doesn't understand why you dislike the pictures, it wasn't a difficult thing to not post them.\n\nIf it truly bothers you and you want to risk further confrontation with your girlfriend, you could report the images to hopefully have them removed.

You just did the exact same thing to him that she did, minus posting a photo.  You dismissed and minimized his concerns.", "That doesn't matter. Although I hardly think it's an unusual request. The issue here is that OP's girlfriend completely ignored his boundaries and *multiple* explicit requests from him to keep from posting a few specific photos, then dismissed his feelings about her doing so. That's it.\n\nAlso, being self-conscious isn't \"vanity\". Literally, it is the opposite.\n\nVanity is caring more about internet clout than your partner's boundaries.", "OP's face, OP's decision who gets to see it. He explicitly asked her NOT to post it to her accounts in the first place. It was her choice to ignore that, so it is her responsibility to own up to that decision and remove it. A post on a digital account is not worth blatantly disrespecting your partner's explicit boundaries.", "Found the gf", "That was not my intent. I'm more like OP, I tend to be very self-conscious about photos because I never think I look good in them.\n\nHe said not to post it, she did anyway. She's the AH. But it wouldn't hurt him to lighten up a little bit.\n\nAlso, there's nothing gaslighty about that. That is a very particular form of manipulation that gets used way too loosely here."]}
