You don't owe him anything at this point.", "NTA - he signed away his rights, so this is pretty cut and dry.", "NTA.  Your sperm donor literally signed away his rights, and now has the balls to \"want to get to know your son\" after conveniently learning of your financial situation?  That's a big \"fuck no\" in my book.", "NTA.\n\nLegally he is nothing regarding the kid.\n\nTrue, he can have a change of heart. But he can also be a gold digger. \n\nIf you're considering letting him meet the kid, tell him you'll only approve it when he pays all the child support he missed before. Calculate what you spend on kid all those years and half if. Don't forget interest due the lateness.", "NTA, he signed away his parental rights, he no longer gets to be in his life.", "NTA He's clearly after your money. He already said he wanted nothing to do with you, and now he comes back? As for your son, he will forget eventually, tell him when he's older and then he can decide if he wants to have a relationship with his dad.", "NTA. He can't give up his rights and then come back 8 years later thinking everything is ok. I have no advice how to explain the no dad thing to your son.", "NTA. The second he signed those papers, he severed any legal connection to that child he could hope to have. Any potential emotional connection he could have established with your permission, he also rejected. \n\nAs for your son, I'd let him know the situation once he's grown. If he wants to make a connection at that point, it's up to him. But that's the son's right in this situation, not the dad's. Anything you tell him now, as a child, will have to be put delicately, but firmly.\n\nI'm honestly appalled knowing the sort of insensitive questions he was asking about your financial situation, knowing he left you with a child young with no child support (did he know you were without familial support back then?). I'm not sure he knows anything about you having money. He's probably just surprised you're not destitute. I suppose it doesn't matter regardless.", "You are absolutely NTA and you have the money to fight this regardless of it\u2019s origins. You have been only person there for your child, he didn\u2019t care and denied any interest.  Use all the money legal or illegal to keep him away, he is only after cash", "NTA.  He\u2019s rejected you three times: while you were pregnant, when the baby was born, and after you pleaded with him.  \n\nRaising a child is not a decision you can change your mind on. \n\nYou either choose to be in or out; and he repeatedly and legally chose to be out.\n\nWe can speculate on his motivations for suddenly, taking an interest in the child\u2019s life, but at the end of the day it doesn\u2019t matter.  His history speaks volumes. If he truly wants to be in the child\u2019s life, he will take all the time he needs, and do everything he hast to do to show you.

I get he was young at the time but that doesn\u2019t make his behavior acceptable. \n\nWhat you really need to decide is what\u2019s best for your kid though. That\u2019s obviously what matters most here. A conversation between you & the father should happen. Your son is going to get curious.

You\u2019ve got some decisions to make.", "NTA\n\nNot only did he sign away his parental rights, he utterly spurned both you and your child.  And now he suddenly wants to be back in the picture?  Sus.\n\nYour son might be wondering about his father, but it's also your job to protect him.  This guy and his family did *not* make the impression that they are good people.  Something tells me he thinks he can waltz in and out of your son's life when it's convenient for him.  If he were to actually be a father to your child, I'm sure you'd expect him to take some responsibility and help you out with some of the hard stuff that comes with special needs, not just to be around for all the fun stuff.  That is inconvenient.  Were I in your position, I would just avoid the risk to your child's wellbeing entirely by keeping this dude away from him.", "Nope, signed his rights away.

Life is going to be difficult enough as it is.", "No, the baby\u2019s father is. He voluntarily forfeited his parental rights and eight years later, he had the gall asking to see his son? He better go sit his ass down! Once you surrender your parental rights, it\u2019s a done deal.", "NTA. I would never trust his around your son because he has zero interest in this boy. He signed his rights away and now only wants to be around because of your money.", "nta. he made the decision to reject your son. he made the decision to sign his rights away. then he made the decision to threaten you with a restraining order. he fucked up and that\u2019s on him. he has no one to blame but himself. it\u2019s sad that your son is asking about his dad but the best thing you can do is explain it in a kid friendly way with a therapist. you are doing what\u2019s best for your son, he needs people who won\u2019t leave him. not some asshole who didn\u2019t want him.", "NTA.

You sound like a great mom though", ">and is very surprised that I could afford the life I have while basically being unemployed.\n\nSounds like he's the one gold digging now lol.\n\nLook, he signed away his rights, threatened you with a restraining order and ghosted both of you for 8 years.\n\nCould be the cynic in me speaking but since you never sued him for money and they never heard back from you, he probably started wondering how and why, did some digging around and found out a thing or two that made him reach out suddenly. \n\nNTA, but since your son is asking about his dad, maybe consult a lawyer on how you can let him see his dad without opening the door for possible future headaches. Ultimately, your call and either way you're still NTA.", "NTA. He had his chance and chose to be an AH as did his family. You owe them nothing.", "Yes, based on circumstances, I think you made the right decision.  NTA\nAs for your son, I\u2019d answer questions your son asks and attempt to be honest without showing an emotional response.  If son asks how you felt, you can say you feel sad or angry, but with a neutral face.  Then play it by ear based on what your son asks for.  And take into account your sons reasoning development.  He might ask to contact his Dad, but he will have facts with which to make his decision.  This could be soon, it could be years from now.  \n\nBut, I caution from them being alone together.  Dad may try to get monetary information from your son.", "NTA he doesn\u2019t have a son. In terms of how to approach this conversation with your child please seek the support of a psychologist or therapist to guide you in age appropriate language.

After all he put you through he\u2019s most likely not there to try & be a dad to a son he wouldn\u2019t acknowledge!", "NTA. Your son had a father, who refused to acknowledge him, but never had a daddy. That's an important distinction. You can explain to him that through no fault of his (your son) that sometimes people don't get to be with those who are supposed to be their parent. However, and this is important, he gets something extra special - one day he will find someone who fills that spot and that person will love him just as much as his father should have. It may not be soon, but it will happen.\n\nBTW you obviously dodged a bullet. There is no way his father didn't know you had money when he strolled up to your door. Check your friends and family and find out who's been telling your business around town.", "NTA\nI understand that your son wants to meet him. However, as his parent, you have to determine who is safe.\nHe had 8 years to do better.\nHis initial responses make him seem untrustworthy and unreliable.\nYou can\u2019t trust him so why would you give him access to your child?", "Nta. He may want to see your son, your son might want to see his dad, but said sperm donor isn't a father and if he's asking about money, probably would not be a good influence on him. Between asking him for money, asking to \"get the family back together\", whatever won't be a good thing. You don't know his other morals on things either, and if his family did that, might be raised with some other not nice ones.\n\nYou could tell son his father was someone you met at a party, but didn't know him (atm). When he's older he could handle more truth to not steer him into a quest of the \"great unknown\", but he's not old enough yet.", "NTA\n\nHe willingly signed away his rights, that his not his chold and you owe him nothing. People can't decide when they want to be parents when the child is already born, and the impact it will have on your child if he decides to back out a third time??? Speaking from personal experience, having both parents isn't always ideal.\n\nNope, keep protecting your family, which do not always include fathers. When you deem it appropriate, tell your son that his sperm donor wasn't ready for fatherhood and valid anything he feels after the explanation.", "NTA, but you gotta talk to your kid about his dad, and give him some sort of explanation/reason, and consider what he might have to say. the dad doesn't deserve shit, but you don't want to hurt your relationship with your child by denying him something he feels he needs.", "NTA. You had good reasons for turning the baby daddy away after he changed his mind. It wouldn't be a bad idea to reach out on behalf of your son, though.", "NTA. You don\u2019t owe him anything. I suspect that he has some information about your source of income and wants to hear it from your mouth. Someone around you is talking. Having said that, his intention to communicate with his son appears to be financially motivated more than emotional.", "He signed away his rights, legally not the kid's parent anymore..so.... Hello, police? There's a strange man who keeps trying to 'get to know' my little boy...", "NTA. Do what you have yo do to protect your child, mama. When he's grown, if he's still interested, share the sperm donor's name and let your grown son take it from there.", "GIRL, you go! NTA and tell him that your finances are none of his f-ing business.", "Here's the truth - he's not contacting you for your son, he's contacting you for the money/image. Even if he did meet your son, he would not be a father, ergo you are not depriving your son of a father. That \"man\" chose not to have anything to do with your son, threatened you even, so he does not get to suddenly reverse this out of his own convenience.

Hoping for you on this one, OP.", "Sperm donors purposefully donate life. \"Sperm donor\" shouldn't be used as a slur. Just call the asshat a deadbeat asshat.", "No, it's not tough. And kids need CONSISTENT parental figures which mom is. The sperm donor is a flake and not a dad.", "He did not say he wants to meet him, he asked why he does have one, so I had a conversation with him with his therapist to explain in an age appropriate way the situation. Now from time to time he would have a question like: was he tall, did he have green eyes like me\u2026", "the \u201cdad\u201d has NO legal rights to the kid. he made the decision to sign his rights away. sucks for him.", "And what happens when \u201cdad\u201d meets him and then disappears again? Bc that will only harm the kid.. dad gave up his rights. You can\u2019t guarantee he just won\u2019t walk away again.", "Technically, OPs son doesn\u2019t have a \u201cdad\u201d. He signed away rights years ago. He only has a mum.\n\nWhat OP needs to do is explain that in an age appropriate way (he\u2019s only 8 after all). Then, when he\u2019s older, he can decide for himself if he wants to find this sperm donor.", "what happens if \u201cdad\u201d walks away again? He gave up his right to being a parent. He can\u2019t just walk back in and say I\u2019ve changed my mind. He took the LEGAL way out and said not my problem.", "he legally signed his rights away. it\u2019s his own fault. that man is nothing but a sperm donor.", "100% agree. He sounds like the gold digger. In terms of your son asking about him, I wouldn\u2019t withhold details about him but at the same time, I would be very clear that he did not want to support him in any way.  When kids are presented with truth, they tend to make incredibly astute and accurate decisions with that truth.  Telling him what he wants to know now, factually, is likely to make him decide to not bother contacting him later in life when he becomes an adult.  Good luck OP, nice job parenting and not looking back \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d", "And may I just say that I love your grandma. What a stellar human.", "Don't forget parenting time. The more time he spends, the less he pays. But since he parented 0%, he doesn't get that credit. Support is the right of the child, not the other parent so he can't get off completely, especially if he's a doctor", "Because that kid is half his child and he should have to pay towards him if he wants to be in his life??", "This only applies when both parents have 50/50 placement. She might have had to pay him something or it could have been a wash. When one parent has the child 100% of the time that parent gets a percentage of the other parent's income UNLESS they sign away rights like they did here.", "I worded that incorrectly, I'm not saying he will forget, I'm saying he will stop asking after a while. I think it's better to let the boy decide whatever to have a relationship with his father when he's a little older. Also from what i understood, he realized op has money and approached her because of that. Not 100% sure tho", "You can\u2019t however fright his always finding a way to contact your child as it grows via social media", "If the kid needs a dad right now and the dad wants to be a dad, then forgive and forget the past and start over.", "Do you honestly think if you told your son right now his dad wants to meet him but you said no that your son would be happy about it? Try asking your son if he wants to meet his dad.", "I have no sympathy got the dad but I do feel the kid who wonders who his dad is", "But does the boy have personal rights to know/meet his dad, it that what he wants?", "And what happens when OP son is 18 and hear the story that 10 years ago his dad tried to be his life and his mom pushed him away.  Don't you think he may hold some resentment towards his mother?", "Than dad would be the bad guy.  \n\nThe way it should have been handled is OP saying im.not comfortable with you meeting my son right now.  But when he's ready he can reach out.  \n\nThat way it leave it up to the son when he's old enough", "Problem here is you're only thinking about the dad feelings.  I'm thinking about the child. \n\nShould he meet the child tomorrow, no. Should OP day I let him decide when he 13/16 or 19 yes", "He was a med student eight years ago; who even knows what he is doing now and if he actually made it to doctor or not. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nThat parenting time is a factor I\u2019m fully aware, but again with one parent being a full blown millionaire, I highly doubt that even 0% parenting time puts him hugely on the hook, unless he is loaded himself.\n\nI\u2019m all for both parents need to support the child; no argument here - but let\u2019s say he has a regular minimum wage job (again OP does not even know what he actually does now), there is no way that I would find it ok to make him pay child support to an actual millionaire. Not cool at all; the child very clearly has what he needs.", "That\u2019s not how child support works. And neither does paying or not paying child support have any impact on a parent having custody or visitation with the child. Poverty can not prevent parents from having parenting time (not saying that this dude is poor, but in general).", "My understatning is that dad reached out and then found out about her way of life, but still in the dark regarding OP being rich.", "Big IF you've got there. Looks like it has more to do with YOUR issues, then the OP's needs.", "Not without back child support. I'd be asking for a check and then watching him flee the opposite direction as expected", "No. \n\nSometimes it is the job of a parent to keep their child from damaging people and it seems pretty clear that this guy is one of those. Why are people advocating for a guy who literally *signed away his rights* to be able to get to know that same child he rejected? Do you want him to end up with double the damage?", "i feel for the kid too but it doesn\u2019t seem like the dad is a good person to be in his life. also im sure once the kid is old enough OP will tell her kid the the truth. he deserves to know but i don\u2019t think now is the best time. the dad didn\u2019t want him. he went as far as signing his rights away AND threatening a restraining order. also seems like he was mainly interested in OP\u2019s money since he kept asking about it. the dude didn\u2019t want the kid. therefore he doesn\u2019t deserve a relationship with the kid.", "sure but i don\u2019t think that is best for him. he deserves someone who wants him and will actually be there for him. doesn\u2019t seem like the \u201cdad\u201d will. it honestly seems like he\u2019s more interested in OP\u2019s money.", "OP says she has had the help of a therapist explain the dad situation.. but why is it ok for him to come and go as he pleases? You seriously don\u2019t see anything wrong with him saying no thanks to stepping up and being a dad and just waltzing back in like he has the right to do that? He signed his rights away.", "Are you OP\u2019s baby daddy?", "You're not thinking about the child at all. If you were then you'd be like 'shit, yeah, he rejected this kid for eight years, why would OP ever, ever let him near her child again'. \n\nThis isn't a Hallmark movie, he doesn't get to waltz in when he feels like it. At best I'd say OP could check in with him again when he's 13-16 depending on his emotional maturity, because eventually he's going to realize that his dad threw him away and he should have a lot more emotional maturity before he's asked to decide if he wants to risk that again.\n\nEdit: Woops, I somehow completely missed the mention of meeting when their older, completely on me for not reading thoroughly.", "if you read my other comments you\u2019d see i\u2019m not only thinking of the dad\u2019s feelings. but even then, the child deserves someone better than some asshole who didn\u2019t want him and went as far as signing his rights away. yes the child should meet his dad when he\u2019s older but that\u2019s if he still wants to. i think the mom should wait and tell the kid the trusts when he\u2019s old enough but for now keep the dad away. she\u2019s already explained in the comments she told him (son) in a kid friendly way with his therapist. she also said the kid doesn\u2019t want to know him but asks questions about him.", "I never said that was how child support works, I\u2019m just saying that he wasn\u2019t there for the kid for eight years, and op handled everything by herself, and he signed away rights. He doesn\u2019t get to just swan back into the picture and demand things. And I\u2019m also not speaking about a lack of funds, he comes from a family of doctors! The dude is minted. He could have absolutely paid something towards the life he created and chose instead not to. He\u2019s made his bed.", "I guess we have a difference of opinion- and that\u2019s ok", "I agree now isn't the best time and that'd what OP should have said.  Because what if now he just disappears again and OP never can find him.  Personally I would have sucked it up and politely said I have him reach out when he's older.  Not push him away", "At best he gets a dad in his life. At worst he meets his dad once and learns first hand he's a jerk.", "I never did it's ok.  Thing is you're thinking it's OP way or the \"father\" way.  Instead f thinking what's best for the child.  \n\nPushing the father away saying \"you have no son\" isn't going to be in OP favor because at some point as a child or an adult he would want to meet his father.   \n\nSo what if OP loses all contact and can't find him years from now or if he passes away.  If her so find out this story who do you think he'll blame?", "Damn I was really hoping people will stop with this unoriginal comment in 2023.", "Weird how you disagree with me and than say how OP should check when he's 13/16 which is exactly what I said lol", "First, I'm not going to call a man an AH for signing his rights away, I mean women put children up for adoption all the time I wouldn't consider them assholes if they want to meet their bio children later in life. \n\nAnd yes we agree the child should get to choose when he's older.  Which is why I believe OP saying you have no son was a selfish response.  Because I would want to keep communication open so that when my child is old enough I know where and how to contact them", "honestly it\u2019s understandable why she pushed him away though. he didn\u2019t want anything to do with the kid, signed his rights away and he threatened her with a restraining order. i think it\u2019s best for her and for her son to push him away for now.", "which wouldn\u2019t be fair to the kid. op even said the kid doesn\u2019t want to meet his dad that he just has questions about his dad.", "Sorry, didn\u2019t get your memo", "My bad, I'm honestly not sure how I completely missed that as I see it's in your other comment too, lol. I think I was riding some irritation from some other posters who want him to meet the child immediately. Sorry about that!", "usually i agree to not call a man an ah for signing his rights away but in this case? i will. he didn\u2019t want anything to do with the kid for the past 8 years and suddenly he wants to? no, to me that makes him an ah.", "I can't argue with you're opinion and you maybe right but I just disagree with pushing away. .\n\n\nSeems it would be better to just keep an arm distance instead of saying it will never happen", "It's cool just saying be more creative or you know actually argue your point", "I mean again let's use an adoption case.  Woman has a child, give it up for adoption 8 years later interested in meeting them.  I wouldn't consider her an AH because sounds like a young adult who wasn't ready for a child and now being older they want to meet the person who share their DNA.  \n\nThis is a different topic but we look down on men who sign their rights away bit praise women who give their child up for adoption \"because it's a hard choice\".  Truthfully it's the same, just a person not ready to take care of a child.", "There\u2019s no point in arguing my position in this thread with someone who obviously doesn\u2019t want to listen and is just playing devils advocate. I\u2019ll take your advice tho, thanks!", "but that case is different from this. he didn\u2019t sign his rights away because he was young and didn\u2019t want a kid, it seems like he signed them away because he and his family assumed op was a gold digger.", "That was the reason he questioned paternity.  To me the fact he was 23 and OP was just a random sex partner is why he didn't want to be a father"]}
