You don't owe him anything at this point.", "NTA - he signed away his rights, so this is pretty cut and dry.", "NTA.  Your sperm donor literally signed away his rights, and now has the balls to \"want to get to know your son\" after conveniently learning of your financial situation?  That's a big \"fuck no\" in my book.", "NTA.\n\nLegally he is nothing regarding the kid.\n\nTrue, he can have a change of heart. But he can also be a gold digger. \n\nIf you're considering letting him meet the kid, tell him you'll only approve it when he pays all the child support he missed before. Calculate what you spend on kid all those years and half if. Don't forget interest due the lateness.", "NTA, he signed away his parental rights, he no longer gets to be in his life.", "NTA He's clearly after your money. He already said he wanted nothing to do with you, and now he comes back? As for your son, he will forget eventually, tell him when he's older and then he can decide if he wants to have a relationship with his dad.", "NTA. He can't give up his rights and then come back 8 years later thinking everything is ok. I have no advice how to explain the no dad thing to your son.", "NTA. The second he signed those papers, he severed any legal connection to that child he could hope to have. Any potential emotional connection he could have established with your permission, he also rejected. \n\nAs for your son, I'd let him know the situation once he's grown. If he wants to make a connection at that point, it's up to him. But that's the son's right in this situation, not the dad's. Anything you tell him now, as a child, will have to be put delicately, but firmly.\n\nI'm honestly appalled knowing the sort of insensitive questions he was asking about your financial situation, knowing he left you with a child young with no child support (did he know you were without familial support back then?). I'm not sure he knows anything about you having money. He's probably just surprised you're not destitute. I suppose it doesn't matter regardless.", "You are absolutely NTA and you have the money to fight this regardless of it\u2019s origins. You have been only person there for your child, he didn\u2019t care and denied any interest.  Use all the money legal or illegal to keep him away, he is only after cash", "NTA.  He\u2019s rejected you three times: while you were pregnant, when the baby was born, and after you pleaded with him.  \n\nRaising a child is not a decision you can change your mind on. \n\nYou either choose to be in or out; and he repeatedly and legally chose to be out.\n\nWe can speculate on his motivations for suddenly, taking an interest in the child\u2019s life, but at the end of the day it doesn\u2019t matter.  His history speaks volumes. If he truly wants to be in the child\u2019s life, he will take all the time he needs, and do everything he hast to do to show you.

I get he was young at the time but that doesn\u2019t make his behavior acceptable. \n\nWhat you really need to decide is what\u2019s best for your kid though. That\u2019s obviously what matters most here. A conversation between you & the father should happen. Your son is going to get curious. You can either mend something & have father apart of kids life (proving that he wants that) or you can wait til the kid ends up reaching out to father. You\u2019ve got some decisions to make.", "NTA\n\nNot only did he sign away his parental rights, he utterly spurned both you and your child.  And now he suddenly wants to be back in the picture?  Sus.\n\nYour son might be wondering about his father, but it's also your job to protect him.  This guy and his family did *not* make the impression that they are good people.  Something tells me he thinks he can waltz in and out of your son's life when it's convenient for him.  If he were to actually be a father to your child, I'm sure you'd expect him to take some responsibility and help you out with some of the hard stuff that comes with special needs, not just to be around for all the fun stuff.  That is inconvenient.  Were I in your position, I would just avoid the risk to your child's wellbeing entirely by keeping this dude away from him.", "Nope, signed his rights away.

He's old enough to know that actions have consequences and he's on,y got himself to blame for this.", "NTA You did the right thing by turning him away. If he was genuinely wanting to get to know his kid, then I would say you should let him, but considering the fact that he kept asking about your money, that instantly tells me that he\u2019s just looking for handouts and isn\u2019t actually interested in getting to know his kid and honestly your son does not need that kind of toxicity. Life is going to be difficult enough as it is.", "No, the baby\u2019s father is. He voluntarily forfeited his parental rights and eight years later, he had the gall asking to see his son? He better go sit his ass down! Once you surrender your parental rights, it\u2019s a done deal.", "NTA. I would never trust his around your son because he has zero interest in this boy. He signed his rights away and now only wants to be around because of your money.", "nta. he made the decision to reject your son. he made the decision to sign his rights away. then he made the decision to threaten you with a restraining order. he fucked up and that\u2019s on him. he has no one to blame but himself. it\u2019s sad that your son is asking about his dad but the best thing you can do is explain it in a kid friendly way with a therapist. you are doing what\u2019s best for your son, he needs people who won\u2019t leave him. not some asshole who didn\u2019t want him.", "NTA.

You sound like a great mom though", ">and is very surprised that I could afford the life I have while basically being unemployed.\n\nSounds like he's the one gold digging now lol.\n\nLook, he signed away his rights, threatened you with a restraining order and ghosted both of you for 8 years.\n\nCould be the cynic in me speaking but since you never sued him for money and they never heard back from you, he probably started wondering how and why, did some digging around and found out a thing or two that made him reach out suddenly. \n\nNTA, but since your son is asking about his dad, maybe consult a lawyer on how you can let him see his dad without opening the door for possible future headaches. Ultimately, your call and either way you're still NTA.", "NTA. He had his chance and chose to be an AH as did his family. You owe them nothing.", "Yes, based on circumstances, I think you made the right decision.  NTA\nAs for your son, I\u2019d answer questions your son asks and attempt to be honest without showing an emotional response.  If son asks how you felt, you can say you feel sad or angry, but with a neutral face.  Then play it by ear based on what your son asks for.  And take into account your sons reasoning development.  He might ask to contact his Dad, but he will have facts with which to make his decision.  This could be soon, it could be years from now.  \n\nBut, I caution from them being alone together.  Dad may try to get monetary information from your son.", "NTA he doesn\u2019t have a son. In terms of how to approach this conversation with your child please seek the support of a psychologist or therapist to guide you in age appropriate language. When he\u2019s 18 he can seek out the sp**m donor but keep him out rn.", "NTA - he didn\u2019t want any responsibility for your son and signed away his rights. As far as your money streams, they have nothing to do with him. He & His family treated you so poorly! Why should he need to be involved with them??", "Absolutely positively NTA and don\u2019t let him try to weasel his way back in your life!! After all he put you through he\u2019s most likely not there to try & be a dad to a son he wouldn\u2019t acknowledge!", "NTA. Your son had a father, who refused to acknowledge him, but never had a daddy. That's an important distinction. You can explain to him that through no fault of his (your son) that sometimes people don't get to be with those who are supposed to be their parent. However, and this is important, he gets something extra special - one day he will find someone who fills that spot and that person will love him just as much as his father should have. It may not be soon, but it will happen.\n\nBTW you obviously dodged a bullet. There is no way his father didn't know you had money when he strolled up to your door. Check your friends and family and find out who's been telling your business around town.", "NTA\nI understand that your son wants to meet him. However, as his parent, you have to determine who is safe.\nHe had 8 years to do better.\nHis initial responses make him seem untrustworthy and unreliable.\nYou can\u2019t trust him so why would you give him access to your child?", "Nta. He may want to see your son, your son might want to see his dad, but said sperm donor isn't a father and if he's asking about money, probably would not be a good influence on him. Between asking him for money, asking to \"get the family back together\", whatever won't be a good thing. You don't know his other morals on things either, and if his family did that, might be raised with some other not nice ones.\n\nYou could tell son his father was someone you met at a party, but didn't know him (atm). When he's older he could handle more truth to not steer him into a quest of the \"great unknown\", but he's not old enough yet.", "NTA\n\nHe willingly signed away his rights, that his not his chold and you owe him nothing. People can't decide when they want to be parents when the child is already born, and the impact it will have on your child if he decides to back out a third time??? Speaking from personal experience, having both parents isn't always ideal.\n\nNope, keep protecting your family, which do not always include fathers. When you deem it appropriate, tell your son that his sperm donor wasn't ready for fatherhood and valid anything he feels after the explanation.", "NTA, but you gotta talk to your kid about his dad, and give him some sort of explanation/reason, and consider what he might have to say. the dad doesn't deserve shit, but you don't want to hurt your relationship with your child by denying him something he feels he needs.", "NTA. You had good reasons for turning the baby daddy away after he changed his mind. It wouldn't be a bad idea to reach out on behalf of your son, though.", "NTA. You don\u2019t owe him anything. I suspect that he has some information about your source of income and wants to hear it from your mouth. Someone around you is talking. Having said that, his intention to communicate with his son appears to be financially motivated more than emotional.", "He signed away his rights, legally not the kid's parent anymore..so.... Hello, police? There's a strange man who keeps trying to 'get to know' my little boy...", "NTA. Do what you have yo do to protect your child, mama. When he's grown, if he's still interested, share the sperm donor's name and let your grown son take it from there.", "GIRL, you go! NTA and tell him that your finances are none of his f-ing business.", "Here's the truth - he's not contacting you for your son, he's contacting you for the money/image. Even if he did meet your son, he would not be a father, ergo you are not depriving your son of a father. That \"man\" chose not to have anything to do with your son, threatened you even, so he does not get to suddenly reverse this out of his own convenience.

Sperm donor was surprised and not ready to be a dad (and still isn't, maybe one day he will be mature but he's not now), you were, period. You were alone in life, and then you had him.

But make sure you\u2019re honest with your son.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m in a weird eerily similar situation, and there\u2019s no right answer. \n\nI would urge you to take your time here and do what\u2019s in the best interest of your child. I say take your time because it takes preparation. And a lot of mental and emotional stamina to help facilitate without your emotions and money getting in the way. And by emotions I mean him trying to find a vulnerability or connection when you\u2019re trying to talk about your child, consistent, honest, pleasant and clear expectations. Not to assume you\u2019d have any feelings lost on him at this point. \n\nJust a lot of stereotypes also maybe, either you are a demanding or toxic one pushing father out or lonely and needy struggling single mom stereotypes will be annoying cause no one sees themselves do it. Their comments and focus are often on giving you a break you\u2019re so strong OR it\u2019s amazing you manage at all you should be proud. They don\u2019t even ask details, it\u2019s assumed. And to take the support, but how many actually follow that up in proportion? Hehe Anything they sense - and it\u2019s fertile grounds to ask for your finances and they personally confirm you are indeed independent, or how you manage? Why\u2019s that ok everything is so comfortable they\u2019d never say to others - or is it just me? Does it make it better they casually hint at these things about my life specifically and my son? Idk but be mindful and protect your peace. When you are ready, you know you can be there for kiddo.\n\nI can\u2019t speak to why your ex is asking and how to deal, not sure he knows. I would guess most people are pondering the practical aspect - I imagine you get it, if your child needs extra care and you\u2019re managing these things - propel feel entitled to know how you live, afford it. Or theres the other stereotype, assumption you work too much and sold yourself for money when time with your child is more important - if only they knew my schedule to begin with (not even that close). \n\nPrepare for the emotional and mental weight x number of family involved. Cause they don\u2019t see it all the time, but you have to be on point for your child at all times. And their feelings on top of that. With no one who gets the nuances that make your situation hard to share even - cause that\u2019s not your struggle they imagining.\n\nBottom line, just be prepared in life to use the law in your favor, you have a child now it\u2019s there to protect you. If he\u2019s signed off parental rights, no need to sign any over at all. Don\u2019t, you can arrange voluntarily with lawyers to protect primary custody and assets. Sole custody was my first legal thing I did. The patriarchy got me with the last name though haha (it was too late to tell them I didn\u2019t know) - not US based. Anyway, it is an interesting ride what you start having to think of, but you will persevere for your kiddo\u2019s sake, they\u2019re watching and learning from us.\n\nI am sorry you are handling so much with what sounds like no close familial/emotional support. Not paid services (not the same, those are appointments). And I can\u2019t imagine with CP.\n\nWishing you the best - being in that kind of situation I can say once you process the exes presence - and how you\u2019d handle that too - it is a blessing for your child to fill that void. And his joy will be everything. At least that\u2019s what keeps me going. Imho you ARE amazing and capable, you do need to find support for your situation in people who you can lean on without judgement or expectation. You can create your own village - for me it\u2019s those friends I\u2019d consider guardianship material. They\u2019re my stand-in coparents.\n\nLook into online single parent groups in your area, and forums if you\u2019ve not already.

Also, many--not all but enough--kids can have ongoing issues when a parent is absent, especially when they are unknown. \n\nI would recommend you place your child with a counselor experienced in these type of issues with kids. This provides a neutral, professional, **expert** to evaluate what is best for your son short and long term and to help come up with healthy, safe strategies to move in those directions.

If her son want to meet him I say let it happen on her terms but make sure he can\u2019t claim any sort of parental responsibility just in case he thinks getting custody would get him access to her money and decides to try to wiggle back in as \u201cdad\u201d", "As someone who is actually using a sperm donor and not using it in the derogatory way that you are, I think kids deserve to know where they come from and have the right to meet their biological parents.", "wow she\u2019s the ah?? the one who took care of him all his life? And not the one who gave away every right to be called the father of the child?? the one who comes crawling just for the money and probably doesn\u2019t even care about the child? wow. It\u2019s sad that he wants to meet his donor but never ever would I expose my child to a person like this.", "The money isn't immaterial if she suspects that it's the reason he showed up again", " actually she\u2019s not. her kid isn\u2019t asking to meet his dad, he\u2019s just asking about him. her and his therapist already talked to him in a kid friendly way.", "I notice that the \"child's needs\" didn't matter to the father for the first 8 years of his life. So which is it? Does the child's needs come first, or is it reasonable to not care about the needs of a \"gold digger's\" kid? \n\nFathers are completely optional. So are mothers. All a kid needs is at least one loving adult who genuinely cares for them. The father in this post does not meet that requirement and thus it's better to keep him away from the kid (at least until he's older and wise enough not to be manipulated by him).", "That\u2019s not what a sperm donor is. I used a donor and I promise I did not fuck him. Also a lot of actual donor conceived people believe that they have the right the right to meet their bio parents, for the record.", "If he were a sperm donor then he would be someone lovingly chosen by OP to be the biological (but not social) father of her child. He is a man he slept with who is now a deadbeat dad. Those are different. Also many donor conceived people believe that they have a right to meet their bio parents.", "she has talked to her son in a kid friendly way with a therapist! the kid hasn\u2019t asked to meet his dad, he\u2019s only asked questions! she probably won\u2019t need a lawyer because the dude has no legal rights regarding her son since he signed his rights away!", "I was the child in a similar situation,in that I was disabled and always longed to meet my father. I\u2019m very glad I wasn\u2019t given that opportunity until I was of age because he\u2019s a manipulative man and as a child I know I wouldn\u2019t have been able to view him properly. Now, fully learning about him by connecting with my sibling that grew up under him, I\u2019ve lost any yearning for him.\n\nI do wish my mom had answered general questions however, such as what he looked like. She didn\u2019t have any photos and was upset by any questions about him but those were much more rooted in wanting to learn about myself then anything. Growing up not knowing anything about 50% of your genetics, especially when you have medical issues, peaks your interest from a young age.", "Best of luck, send him packing with his own words, get list or *you* will get a restraining order.  Also NTA", "Too right. It is hard to be in the middle with kids because they, of course, want to know and have a connection with both of their parents. \n\nIt can be a double edged sword because on the one hand you feel irrationally guilty when your kid brings up their other parent. On the other hand you logically know you have to protect your kid from the person they want to know. \n\nHang in there OP! I'd be extra careful now that this guy knows where you live, etc.", "You can always tell him that his dad is a strange person and you\u2019ll let him decide if he wants to meet him when he\u2019s a grownup.", "I raised my son as a single parent, no child support.  He met his father once, when he was four because I wanted him to know that his father was a real person, not imaginary.  And so that he had a \"face\".  It was at my insistence and at a neutral place. Kiddo was perfectly content with that as we had a pretty full and fulfilling life, if very far from luxurious.  \n\nI answered any questions he asked (which were few and far between) .  The only sort of disparaging comment I ever made was when he asked why we weren't together.  I told him that his father was a very nice man, but he wasn't as strong-minded as I am and I could take better care of him.  Which was true, btw, as his father would always take path of least resistance and most benefit.  When he got older I told him that if he wanted to meet up with his father I would help him do that in whatever capacity.  \n\nJust knowing he could was enough for him I guess because he has never taken me up on that.  Instead I get love on Mother's Day *and* Father's Day.", "You sound like a very good mom.  \ud83d\udc9a", "You should still contact a lawyer to both double check that you're in the clear and find out what else you can do to get him to back off and protect you and your son. And if possible hire a private investigator to look into your ex. Him showing up out of nowhere and being more interested in your money than your son is both  suspicious and concerning. Also concerning is how he found out about your son's health and that you have money. In situations like this it's better to go on the the full defense and overboard.", "Your child will have as their bio father someone who donated their own biological material to help people. It sounds like OP's son unfortunately has a selfish greedy deadbeat for a bio father. OP shouldn't punish him at the expense of her son, but she probably needs to limit contact to protect her child.", "Also people don\u2019t have sex with sperm donors lol", "OP added the part about him asking about money after I made this comment.\n\nETA: context is important", "Reread the title of this thread...", "Prisons are filled with young men raised by single mothers. I work with at risk youth professionally. There is no greater risk factor. To do this intentionally to a child as revenge over a personal beef (legitimate or not) is reprehensible.", "I didn\u2019t see anywhere in post that she has talked to the child with a therapist. That\u2019s why I suggested it.\n\nIf she decided to allow visitation after so many visits he can take her to court to establish his parental rights again. That\u2019s why I suggested a lawyer since she was on the fence a little. \n\nLook I acknowledged that she has all the power.\n\nI just don\u2019t want her to be like my friend. Her father left her mother then asked for rights when she was 10, her mother denied. She met her father at 18 and ditched her mother until like 22 because she was upset she never allowed her father to be in her life when he came back. Kids process things differently then is adults. I told my friend she was wrong, but she was upset she never had a father and could have had the chance if her mother wasn\u2019t so bitter. Now they her father abandoned her again and we are almost 30 she feels sorry towards her mother. They have done family counseling and have a stronger bond. \n\nThat is why I said it\u2019s up to her, but kids always want to know where they come from. \n\nRead the posts on Reddit where kids are finding out their sperm donors are over adopted and etc. or paternity fraud.They end up  searching for their parents and ditch the ones that raised them because they want to know where they come from. \n\nIt\u2019s not about being legally right, but what\u2019s best for her son: that\u2019s why I suggested therapy.", "OP also needs to prevent her child being used as a tool by this guy as well, especially since she thinks he's after her money.", "This.

He should understand that actions have (financial) consequences and not get a free pass now that he wants to come back, even if it's a symbolic exercise more than anything.", "The title of this thread states the she won't let THIER child see HIS FATHER.

You don\u2019t know what\u2019s best for son. A lot of kids have built relationships with their sperm donors on less. It happens all the time, they can forgive what their parents can\u2019t.

It\u2019s all in her and whatever decision she makes will color how her son views her. I don\u2019t wish her any bad, but I just see it.\nI have seen it with friends and I wonder how you ditch the person whom raised you for the one whom abandoned you, but it\u2019s a bond you never got.
