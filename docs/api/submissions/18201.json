I didn't take it and at first I thought they just misplaced it somewhere. However, they insisted that they both agreed on not moving it out of the fridge drawer for that exact reason. All of us denied taking it and the conversation got more heated when my father started yelling that someone must have taken it since it only went missing when we came to visit. \n\nAll of us continued to deny taking it, with my wife being really quiet, and my father said that if it doesn't turn up soon, he'd have to have everyone's belongings checked. That was when my wife admitted that she took it. Apparently it was some popular brand that my in-laws mentioned and she wanted to give it to them, and she thought that no one would notice since it was in an inconspicuous place in the fridge. \n\nMy MIL later called and said my parents overreacted over \"such an inconsequential thing\" and screamed at me that I was an asshole for not defending my wife. The thing is, imo it wasn't a small thing, my wife literally stole hundreds of dollars from my parents and tried to lie her way out of it. \n\nWhile I agree that my parents shouldn't have started yelling and accusing us, I feel like my wife was in the wrong for taking the ginseng in the first place.

She had no intention of owning up or returning the item until it was unavoidable. She has shown you who she is; someone with no integrity or loyalty. Your parents have done absolutely nothing wrong.

And if her mother thinks what she did was okay, she's lying too", ">my wife admitted that she took it. Apparently it was some popular brand that my in-laws mentioned and she wanted to give it to them\n\nNot just that, but MIL was the intended recipient of the stolen goods. It's not a surprise she would scream at OP for getting in the way of her thieving daughter stealing for her benefit. \n\nThis didn't happen in a vacuum.", "OPs wife is possibly the most unintelligent person I\u2019ve come across lately.\n\n\u201cShe thought no one would notice\u201d. Sure, maybe a bit of random cash, maybe a piece of jewelry, etc\n\nBut the VERY BOTTLE of liquor they are telling you is in there but not to touch bc it\u2019ll be given away within like a day??!!\n\nIf the bottle had a bow on it as well, I\u2019m literally giving up on mankind. \n\n\nOp, where does this marriage go from here?  You\u2019ve got a very enormous bone of contention for your family wrapped up in your wife here. \n\nI\u2019d be so ashamed and embarrassed of my spouse THIS would be a deal breaker. YOU may get over her having spontaneous klepto hands. But your parents never will and it\u2019ll be awkward tension for eternity", "NTA.  This\\^\\^\\^  \n\n\nThere's just no other way to slice it.", "I wouldn\u2019t even need to think about it. Instant divorce. If she\u2019s willing to lie over a box of ginseng for such selfish reasons, she clearly doesn\u2019t love or respect me or my family and I\u2019d never be able to trust her about anything again.", "This will \\*not\\* be the first time she has stolen and lied about it, this is just the first time OP has caught her.", "Did your wife apologize to you and your parents? Your wife is showing you who she is.  You should believe her.  Did she say anything to you? NTA.  If you stay with someone with so little regard for you,  you might think about therapy.  I'm so sorry.  That must have been humiliating for you.", "She wanted to give it to her parents from what OP says", "I was about to say that's probably not her first time...", "The way the parents sat everyone down and threatened to go through their stuff makes me think they've suspected a thief for a while. I bet this isn't the first time.", ">but you are an AH for thinking that your parents had no right to be upset.\n\nOp never said he thought parents had no right to be upset, just that they shouldn't have started out with yelling and accusations. \n\nWhile accusing the people that were there does seem reasonable, it sounds like their entire thought process was \"I don't see it in drawer in fridge, must have been stolen\" \n\nIv seen plenty of times where that happens but turns out it was just misplaced. The doctor that it was stolen in this scenario is the saving grace for the parents but had it just been moved and they forgot alot of people would be calling the husband and then the AH.\n\nFor example an old roomate of mine \"lost\" a nice jacket that a family member had given him, one day he went to wear it couldn't find it and then started accusing all of us that lived their and a couple of our friends of stealing the jacket, called the police and everything. Well it created alot of tension in the house and a few weeks later his parents were visiting and the topic of the jacket came up and he started ranting about people stealing his stuff and his mom goes \"honey you left it at our house a while back because you didn't want anything to happen to it while you weren't wearing it\" so in the end he blew up on everyone and was freaking out all because he forgot where he put it", "Ginseng is no joke. They have multiple ginseng museums and cultural centers in Korea. It's near impossible to get high quality ginseng in America, so people don't understand what a big deal it is because it's not normally a possibility.", "It gets way fancier lol", "Plus the time it took to track down and shipping and the joy they knew it was going to bring to someone else and the pain of being the victim of a crime and the not being able to trust your family and then having to go through bringing it up with your kids. \n\nShe stole more than an $300 item. NTA. She needs to repent.", "That wouldn't be petty at all. At this point I think it'd be irresponsive to not inform anyone else that may have her as a guest", "Those shit are expensive. Especially the good quality one.", "It's a wedding gift.", "Just to give you context ginseng is not liquor but a rare chinese herb. In Asian culture it's literally a considered a treasure and one of the most valuable things you can have at home.\n\nIt's normally packaged in an extravagantly looking box since it is often used as gifts", "Agreed. I\u2019ve been trying to think of a different way to frame it as this sub has a tendency to overreact (burn her!!!). But there is no other way to frame this. \n\nOP, your wife stole a few hundred dollars from your parents. Lied to you about it. And then he parents doubled down on it and have attempted to gaslight you. You\u2019ve assessed everything perfectly.\n\nNTA. And perhaps reflect on the seriousness of what has occurred. You really need to get to the bottom of why she did it beyond \u2018I didn\u2019t think anyone would notice [the theft of $300] because it was in an inconspicuous place.\u2019\n\nIf she does not understand the seriousness of what she has done, what reassurance do you have that there won\u2019t be similar offences in future? And, if she does understand, can you reconcile the reasons why and work with her to iron out those flaws?", "Knowing AITA, this is probably not the first time he's caught his wife stealing or lying, this is just the time she's been this incredulous about it and he's seen something he was ignoring before.", "Dude, my first thought too.", "but why? she knows this is a wedding anniversary gift, why would she think nobody would notice it went missing? would they be like \"Oh no, it's missing. oh well, we will show up with no gift\"", "I choked when I read another comment that thought ginseng was alcohol lol", "No it an anniversary gift learn to read and dont answer questions clearly directed at the op.", "Thank you! I learned something new today. I seriously thought this was like a top top shelf alcohol.  It sounded familiar but I\u2019m not a drinker at all bc it\u2019s just gross to me, but that\u2019s what my American uncultured mind went to!", "Why would you try to paint the husband as a bad guy", "I think she somehow missed it was wedding anniversary gift and thought (because it was stored in a forgettable place) that she could just straight up steal it. So fkn weird lol.", "I think she thought that no one would notice until she left, and by then she\u2019d have plausible deniability.", "Yeah honestly I\u2019m super confused by this part of the story.", "boy has a thieving wife AND a MIL problem.", "Wife is both a thief and an absolute idiot"]}
