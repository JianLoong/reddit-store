She had no intention of owning up or returning the item until it was unavoidable. She has shown you who she is; someone with no integrity or loyalty. Your parents have done absolutely nothing wrong.

The only thing that varies is the final outcome of whether the item was actually stolen or not.\n\nMy whole argument was \"op wasn't happy about them jumping straight to it being stolen and not considering that they may have moved it somewhere.
