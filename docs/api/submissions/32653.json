Nothing any of those 3 asked for cost over $75 per item. (The average cost for them was $500 each) My oldest stepdaughter,  Ruby however, asked for the least  amount of gifts, but the cost added up to be way way more than the other 3 kids and everything for the baby ($300) combined. Macbook pro, Ipad pro, iphone 15 pro max, airpods pro, and tickets to 2 concerts (each ticket was over $500), 1 which requires airfare and a hotel stay, the other one we're paying for her to stay 2 nights but it's in driving distance. \n\nJosh is wanting us to get Ruby more gifts to open on Christmas day as she'll only have 4 actual gifts to open, where the other kids will have significantly more. He says we should get her some makeup, cute dresses, jewelry and accessories so Ruby is not feeling left out while the other kids are opening all of their gifts and she's sitting there with nothing left to open.\n\nI'm against this as between just her 2 concerts and all costs associated with them is over $2500 and her other gifts are rather significant, too. \n\nJosh says I'm being unfair to Ruby, that it's the holidays so getting her some more gifts won't hurt, and we can afford it, but to me its unfair to the other kids when money wise, Ruby is getting so much more than all of them combined.\n\nI told Josh, I refuse to do anymore Christmas shopping but as Ruby's dad I won't stop him from it. He says he's so busy with work he doesn't have time and if I don't do it Ruby won't have much to open Christmas day and might have hurt feelings or feel left out. I told him she's 19, she got everything she asked for and I'm not doing anymore shopping for her. Josh says he can't believe I'd treat Ruby like she's not important, I told him again, I'm done shopping, anything more, he's got to figure out.

It is a shame he will have to work longer hours to pay for such needless extravagance and miss so much time with the family.

The crux as I understand it is that OP isn\u2019t willing to do the shopping or spend her own money, and has put the responsibility on the child\u2019s father to put forth the effort (and cash) either way though no way OP is an asshole for setting limits on spending and on her time and energy.

They even do gift wrapping for him.  He could get those things for her in 10-15 minutes and that would be the end of it, not such a big crunch on his time.  I mean, you're right on all points, but on the other hand, it's normal for older kids in college to get more expensive gifts since their pastimes cost more, they need better computers for college and work, etc.  I'm kinda with the commenters saying when you're 19 is when you should start being happy about little kids getting more things, but then I also think younger kids need WAY fewer presents to open on Christmas and birthdays.  It sounds as though this is a step-parent/bio-parent conflict that requires more diplomacy than principle, but that's up to you.", "Nope.
