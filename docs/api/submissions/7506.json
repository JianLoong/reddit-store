Any of those people yelling could have given up their seats, too.", "NTA - as someone who lives with an invisible autoimmune/chronic pain, I totally get this.

Also, you made sure to let her know why you wouldn't.  It wasn't just because you were being selfish.   \n You had a valid reason not to want to.  There was literally a bus full of other people.  You do not carry the sole responsibility of having to get up for a pregnant lady.", "Nta. You had legit medical issues. Her pregnancy doesn\u2019t trump medical issues.", "NTA. You're not obligated to give up your seat on public transportation. Seats are first come first serve. Being Pregnant does not make one entitled nor does it entitle someone to act like that.
