{"id": 11876, "submission_id": "11mvt5o", "title": "AITA for telling the truth when asked if my husband took paternity leave?", "selftext": "I (31F) have a friend, April (also 31), who is currently expecting her first child with her husband, Charles. April has mentioned that she and Charles are disagreeing over whether he should take paternity leave. His company offers 2 weeks leave, and the option to use paid leave days to supplement that, so he could take up to a month (we are in the UK). He is adamant that he doesn't want to do this, because it is uncommon in the company - typically a man will only take one week -  so taking more would make him look bad and hurt promotion prospects. April has brought this up with me before as a dispute they've been having and how she is trying to persuade him to take the time off.\n\nAbout a week ago I was visiting April at home, and Charles was there. We were all having coffee and April was talking about how her mother in law would be coming to stay right after the birth (her mother lives abroad). Charles chimed in how good it would be for her to have the extra support, but April said it would be better if he'd also take some time off to be there as well. I could see Charles was used to this argument, and they kind of sniped back and forth for a bit before Charles asked me if my husband had taken time off after our daughter was born. I said he didn't, which is true, and Charles asked if I was upset that he hadn't, which again I answered with a truthful no. I did clarify that I had my mother, an NCS, and full time house staff as well, and my husband is self-employed, so the situations weren't comparable, but Charles obviously wasn't listening past my initial answer. He said April will have his mother there too and if I ca handle it she can too. April tried to continue the argument but Charles then left to work from his home office. \n\nOnce he was gone April snapped that I was absolutely no help and I should have just lied instead of making everything worse, and how she sick of being persecuted for not being \"super mum\" already. I apologised and said I didn't think Charles would compare the two like for like, especially since he's aware we had our daughter via surrogate. April said I should have absolutely seen where this washing since Charles has made comments comparing our pre-birth situations in the past. I apologised again but eventually it was just so awkward that I left. April is now not returning my calls which frankly I think is a bit childish. \n\nOur mutual friends are split. Some are siding with April saying I should have lied, others are saying April is overreacting to the truth and that if I'd lied and the truth ever came out both April and I would look like we'd colluded to manipulate him. Personally, I think April and Charles's arrangements are up to them, and I shouldn't be expected to prop up one side of their argument with a lie. That said, I'm starting to feel like maybe I'm missing something, so I thought I would get some objective perspective.

Yet another man that doesn\u2019t want to look after their own child.", "NTA-sounds like Charles has already made up his mind what he was going to do anyway.

You rightly pointed out that your life and circumstances are not the same as hers and aren't terribly relevant. She shouldn't be dragging her friends into an argument of this sort with her husband.\n\nCharles is an asshole. Take time off and be with your family. That's some pretty toxic masculinity bull right there.  I would absolutely take paternity leave if my wife could have kids. Not only to help her but so I can also adjust to the new life, and bond with the child as early as possible.  Charles is being the bigger ass here.", "NTA - you aren\u2019t in the same position as her.  Her husband should use all his leave, that is what it is there for.  Having loyalty to a company that has none for you is dumb.", "My husband tells every soon to be parent at his company to take the full 12 weeks they're allowed for two reasons. First, because the more it is utilized, the better it will be for everyone. It needs to be normal for new parents to take parental leave. Second, because if they choose the shorter parental leave period and end up needing more time, they don't have the option of extending it without using PTO. If they take the 12 weeks, they can come back early if they want to with no problems. So everyone should take the 12 week option to make it better for all the other parents in the company. \nWe were very grateful that he took the longer leave because our youngest son, the only one we had since he's been at this company, wouldn't sleep without being held, especially for those first three months.

Thankfully after that, he was able to work from home so we still had more flexibility.", "NTA - Her not returning your calls is not childish, it's a blessing.", "NTA.  Honesty is never wrong.  Charles is the AH for refusing to see the differences in your situations AND for refusing to take all the time allotted to him.

Your friend is probably stress and going through hormones with the baby coming but that doesn't excuse some of her behavior. Friend's husband sucks for just being stupid. You really should have seen this coming from a mile away given the background and then sniping back and forth.\n\nAlso, I don't think this is not a dichotomy and there's a third option! You could have said your situation is very different so it is not fair to use you as the example, and leave it at that. No lying, but also not giving ammo to friend's idiot husband to use.", "You're NTA. Everyone criticizing you is ridiculous.\n\nYou answered honestly. Maybe you were a little dense, but that's not being an AH. Your friend's problem is with her crappy husband, and she's taking it out on you.

She doesn't want to speak to you right now, and she doesn't have to. You said  you think that the situation is between them, but you had no problem adding fuel to the fire. You could have easily said I'm not getting involved, or our situations are different and cannot be compared.", "NTA. Honesty is the best policy.", "NTA. It might\u2019ve been nice to tell a lie, but you aren\u2019t obliged to assume Charles will take what you say in bad faith.\n\nThat said, I\u2019d recommend being understanding to April and cutting her a lot of slack. Pregnancy + a husband who is very clearly going to be less parenting help than you expected is a hell of a combination to deal with.", "Nta\n\nBUT. \n\n\nI'm sad for you to read how used you are in having a deadbeat husband at home that doesn't parent at all. \nSo conditioned into thinking your situation is normal that you don't even question it.", "NTA all the people here said everything I could have said, and I want to add, maybe(thats up to you and if you have the time for that) ask your friend if you can help her in the first few weeks/months. They are the hardest and maybe she just feels overwhelmed. Bring sth to eat, maybe have an eye on the little one while she is napping, come in where the husband is missing, maybe it makes is easier to her. But thats up to you", "YTA. Before you even answered you should have reminded them your situation was different and will be nothing like theirs so the comparison wouldn't have been relevant.", "NTA. What kind of friend expects you to lie about something like this? You told the truth and explained your situations were different. They shouldn't be getting you involved in this anyway.", "NAH really, but I do think you\u2019re being a little odd not to give your pregnant and stressed friend grace with her reaction, and coming to Reddit to get other people\u2019s responses to clear your conscience. She\u2019s not in the right to hold a grudge, you apologized. And it\u2019s ducked to drag people into your marital issues. But I\u2019m guessing her cold shoulder has more to do with her misgauging the type of support you\u2019d offer, basically not wanting to deal with additional stress during her pregnancy- rather than being pissed at this one thing. \n\nI also think husband should take the two weeks. But I also wouldn\u2019t condemn him if the culture of the org would look down on him tangibly for doing so. Toxic masculinity hurts men too.", "NTA. but listen, motherhood is difficult enough, and having it with non supportive misogynistic men like your husband and hers is making it more difficult. \n\nThere's going to be a lot of support needed from female friends as your kids get older, and if you don't have their back in times of need, they certainly won't have yours.", "YTA for sure. You supposedly think their arguments are between them, but when her husband asked you to stick your nose in it you did without hesitation. Not to mention that you claimed you didn't expect him to compare your experiences, despite the fact that he's done it before? \n\nYou had no issue sticking your nose in their business, just not to come to the defense of your friend.  You didn't have to lie for her, but you could've still backed her up instead of throwing her under the bus.", "NTA. It is always to speak the truth. What if Charles found out you were lying later? It is really between them.", "NTA. Sorry, there is no reason a man needs to stay home for a month. Each time I had a baby, my husband had to leave for deployment the next day. I didn\u2019t have a MIL to house staff. If I could do three kids alone, she can surely do a baby with her MIL and husband home for a week.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We needed the full 12 weeks because I had a rough recovery and our youngest wouldn't sleep without being held. So we had to take shifts.", "It\u2019s sexist to think any women would know that. Ironic since I saw your funny comment calling OP\u2019s husband misogynist with 0 context. Idk why you keep shitting on OP\u2019s husband or OP\u2019s choice in how they have a child and raise a child with their husband. Just say you hate all men.", "She should have started with that and refuse to play their little game of yes or no. The problem is with answering \"no\" first and then trying to explain.", "I hope they stretched beforehand because YIKES.", "Standard protocol for this sub", "Then he CHOSE to not spend the first few weeks with his kids. That's a CHOICE when he shouldn't have. \nThat's a deadbeat in my book.", "Sorry? Just to clarify, you answered no to \"did you husband take parental leave leave?\" When \n\n\n1. You didn't give birth\n\n\n2. You were home either?\n\n\n3. You also had your mother?\n\n\nAnd you are asking if you're TA for allowing a guy passing on helping his wife who (presumably) \n\n\n1. Will be giving birth, with all the physical trauma involved. \n\n\n2. Will presumably not be going to a post natal retreat\n\n\n3. Will not have her mother\n\n\n4. Will instead have her mother in law. \n\n\nYeah... you are YTA!\n\n\nYou are allowing a deadbeat to use the fact you had an incredibly easy path to a child to brow beat his pregnant wife.", "Your husband absolutely is a deadbeat. that's not in question. You're just conditioned to think it's normal to go through childbirth and then go straight home alone.", "Rich people problems", "lol, i have a live in nanny too for the last eight years. I sympathize for you tho. kids are super difficult if you want to really bond with them, get to know them as humans, and have lasting relationships. You're so focused on how he pays money to not have to interact with them, or how he provides, instead of being a dad. Do you call it 'looking after/babysitting' when you spend time with your kid?", "You knew what he was going to use that information for, though. You should have just said: \"I am not getting involved.\" It's that simple.", "And I'm not taking anything away from being a new parent. That's hard even with support. \n\nBut it's a totally different situation when you are a new parent recovering from the trauma of birth while adjusting to a newborn at the same time.", "In this case, it's absolutely mutually exclusive because it's clearly distressing his wife to such a degree. So even if we trust him that his job will not be happy with him taking one extra week off (which is asinine but whatever), then he's decided to piss off his wife instead of his job. So he's 100% putting his job ahead of his family in this instance.", "I feel like Charles passing April off to his own mother is part of the reason why April is so distraught and distressed.\n\nI know we don't know the relationship between April and her MIL, but she is much more comfortable with her husband taking care of the baby. You hear horror stories of MILs overstepping boundaries when it comes to their newborn grandchildren, and it's possible this MIL could do the same (just my own speculation).", "I had all my kids before the fed gov gave 12 weeks, would have loved that.  I was the primary caregiver for one of them while my wife recovered from complications, but had to go back after 3 weeks.  Loved that whole 3 weeks and wish I had more.", "why, do all men refuse to co-parent? That seems really unfair to men who are involved in their kids lives to lump them in with dudes like these guys.", "Seriously.  My dad couldn\u2019t take paternity leave because he was an intern when I was born, in the early 80s.  If he took paternity leave, he\u2019d have had to give up the internship, which was at a fairly prestigious company doing 100% exactly what he wanted to do.  I don\u2019t know any people who had more involved fathers than me unless they had issues with their mother.  My parents split most child rearing pretty damn evenly, other than my dad being much more involved in my sister and I playing sports (my mom was never into any sports, dad sis and I all loved playing soccer).", "Not only did he not choose it, she went off to a retreat. lol", "Wait, \u201callowing a guy\u201d? This guy is his own adult. OP is not responsible for what he says or does. \n\nOP was honest and even advocated for her friend, explaining how the situations are different. That is all anyone can ask of her. It is not her fault that Charles is twisting things in an argument with his wife.", "I didn't go through childbirth, but okay. Good thing you didn't marry him then. Have a nice day.", "You people need to check your own personal baggage at the door before coming on this sub, you don\u2019t know her husband, you can\u2019t judge him.", "\u201cEvery night he looked after her while I went out with my mother or friends?\u201d\n\nDid you miss that?", "You could have simply said that it wasn't your business to intervene, or that your situations weren't the same. You knowingly have him firing power to mistreat your friend when you knew it wasn't really relevant to their argument.\n\nOops, sorry, I meant to reply to OP", "What is NCS? Is it like a night nanny?", "There you go again with your sexist comments. Guys like OP\u2019s husband who, OP doesn\u2019t seem to mind, wasn\u2019t able to take paternity leave? You do know that depending on what they do, just because someone is self-employed doesn\u2019t mean they can just take leave, right? Didn\u2019t you just ask why all men refuse to co-parent so how are there now guys involved in parenting?", "My dad was a fruit farmer when me and my brother were born. I'm sure he could've just told the trees to fuck of and stop needing care for a couple weeks, especially when I was born in spring", "Except it is like you saying the birth of your child wasn't that difficult and didn't need to take parental leave.... because you didn't carry the damn baby for 9 month or go through labour or have a csection, to another man trying to justify not taking paternity leave. I'm guessing the woman who birthed (your real or imaginary child) would disagree on the difficulty of it and the real need for support.", "Okay, but you brought a brand new human into a home where one of the parents wouldn't take a few days off to spend with them. The same person who wouldn't bat an eyelid at taking a few days off for vacation.", "Do you think she went out every single night with her friends. When she had to take her newborn to a retreat, and the other parent wouldn't take a couple of days off. \n\nOr do you think she says 'every night', as in 'any time i went out', he gracefully 'looked after' ha.", "That\u2019s a lot of onus to put on OP so say they\u2019re an asshole for answering a question because they could\u2019ve known the asker had bad motives.", "It's a Newborn Care Specialist, she was trained specifically to look after newborn babies. She was also a really valuable resource in teaching us a lot about newborn care.", "I think it's referring to the subsidies program that exists in some EU nations. \n\nhttps://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/pre_school_education_and_childcare/national_childcare_scheme.html#:~:text=Further%20information-,What%20is%20the%20National%20Childcare%20Scheme%3F,which%20is%20not%20means%20tested.", "There's no \"except\". OP isn't responsible for what Charles does. Stop trying to pin this man's behavior on this woman.\n\nWhat you're describing would be a jerk thing to do *if OP had done any of it*, but she didn't. She said her husband didn't take parental leave and then did the exact opposite of what you're describing, saying how different the situations are and it doesn't apply. She just didn't lie or hide her reality.", "Whether you agree with the decision or not, that doesn't erase the fact that it was a mutual decision. He doesn't bear the whole responsibility for making it. There were a lot of reasons for it, and I have never once resented him for it, or felt we should have done things differently. \n\nBut look, you feel how you feel, everyone's got their own opinions, but I think making that kind of judgement about someone you don't know, when you don't know the circumstances, is dogmatic and unkind.", "It was supposed to say \u201cevery night he\u2019s home\u201d but I missed that in re typing it. \n\nThat means any time he *wasn\u2019t* working, he\u2019d immediately jump on taking the baby so that he could let her get time to herself and him get time with the baby.\n\nHe\u2019s *self-employeed*. Meaning he is either an independent contractor or he owns his own business. Even if he has great insurance, either of those things could mean him taking multiple weeks away could significantly impact their future financial security. In an idillic world, that wouldn\u2019t matter. But we do, in fact, live in a world where money & financial security matter.\n\nThey, as a married couple, made the decision that it was better for them to go this route than have him home. I bet there were sacrifices on all ends for that to have been the route. But for you, someone entirely uninvolved in the situation, to immediately say that her husband is misogynistic for not staying home is just absolutely uncalled for. Why are you assuming she wasn\u2019t an equal part of this decision? Why do you believe her choices don\u2019t matter? Not every choice every woman makes is a feminist one - I\u2019ll give you that. But just because her *and* her husband made the decision that it was best for them doesn\u2019t mean that she\u2019s a helpless woman in a relationship with a misogynistic man who does nothing expect provide financially. She even says that they *go on trips with him* not that he pays for her to fly and travel with the baby by herself.\n\nOP - I applaud you and your husband for finding a way to make it work for you both where you didn\u2019t feel alone or unsupported through the process, even if he didn\u2019t get to stay home with you. It\u2019s unfair that we live in a world where that isn\u2019t always an option, but I\u2019m glad you were able to make it work.", "Parenting though, when there are two parents - is about both those people putting in equal effort. You going to a retreat with a new baby, and him.... staying home? isn't equal effort. Unless you solely consider 'monetary input = love'.", "Honestly, i can't, i really can't. This is a lot. financial security matters of course. The OP left out a lot of information in her original post, and i did say she is NTA. \n\nYet, emotional support from your female friends is crucial when raising kids, there's no amount of money that can fulfill that role.", "I'm not really sure what you want to achieve here. You want to debate views on parenting, relationships, life in general? You want to persuade me of your viewpoint? You've judged the situation in the post, do you just want to chat now?", "I'm answering your comments in post, and not in the echo chamber way you want, so it's irritating you. You're never going to understand my viewpoint, much the same way that you don't care to understand how you aren't that good of a friend to April.", "I'm not irritated, just bemused, I guess. Fair enough on your viewpoints. Best of luck to you."]}
