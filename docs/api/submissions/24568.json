My boss gave us an assignment where we had to pick an artist to base our project on and do a portrait shoot in that style. \n\nMy sister (36f) is a freelance photographer and has done modeling before. She was the first person I thought of because I thought she would enjoy spending time with her little sister doing something she felt passionate about.\n\nYesterday she planned to come over at 2pm. I texted her at 10am make sure we were still on. I didn't worry because I gave her over two weeks notice and we've been chatting about our plans several times since. I got no response. I texted her again an hour later, nothing. It got to be 15 minutes before she would leave her apartment to get here, I called and got sent to voicemail.\n\nShe called me at 2:15 saying that she fell asleep and would get here by 3:00. I told her that it happens and that it's OK if she's an hour late. I was already frustrated and wanted to get this over with so I can have something to turn in. I rented lighting equipment from school and have it this weekend only. I had to ask my bosses boss to rent the equipment for more than a day, which is the longest you can usually keep the gear as it is very expensive.\n\nShe shows up 5. She gets into the studio (that I spent two days cleaning for her) and I offer her a seat. She said \"No thanks, I'm fine standing\". She started looking at her phone scrolling on instagram. I am annoyed that she is not paying attention to me after being 3 hours late, especially when there was no communication on her side that she wasnt in the headspace model today. \n\nI've worked for two days cleaning my apartment making it look good for her. I was up until 2am creating a backdrop and taking test shots. Apparently I didnt clean well enough, because she found mold on my window and said that it gives her anxiety to be in a space that is not clean to her standards. \n\nShe said it was hard for her with the fan blowing mold particles all over the room, and made her feel like she needed to shower. I said the fan was blowing the hot air out, and I've been sweating and cleaning for her I could finally afford to buy a fan the day before. \n\nShe goes on about how I've changed these last few years, and that she doesnt like that I am gaining weight and letting myself go. She said I don't seem to care about anything. She also said that I am not being considerate of her OCD. This made me upset because I have always advocated for her mental health. I am more than happy to accommodate her. That's what I've been doing for two days straight. I've been cleaning to avoid her scrutiny. \n\nWhen she commented on my weight I told her to leave. She told me that I was being rude and that I wouldn't accommodate her. She texted me twice and called me 10 minutes after leaving because she forgot her coffee, and that she needs her coffee. I didn't respond or pick up, and I drank her coffee. \n\nAll because of mold. So tell me reddit.

As someone who has a toxic older sister, she is TOXIC. \n\nIt can be a hard thing to acknowledge, but it's true. Those were awful things for her to say to you and I'm so sorry that she did. I'm glad you stood up for yourself and asked her to leave. \n\nI tend to keep my own toxic sister at a distance. I don't share things with her that are deeply important to me because I know she will criticize them. She also makes comments about my body.\n\nYou're not alone. It really, really, sucks and I'm sorry, but you're NTA. Most likely, you rarely are. \n\nSet boundaries with your sister and stop inviting her to be involved with things that matter to you. It's hard, but it's for the best. If you don't want to go NC, the best way to handle it is to keep her at a safe distance without cutting her off entirely. But be mindful and aware of the situation.

That's AH territory for sure. You worked really hard to make things comfortable for her and she treated you like she doesn't even care about you, your time, or your feelings.\n\nJust a thought: Is there a way that maybe you could set a timer on the camera and be your own model? Screw her for implying that you're not beautiful or worthy. I think a photoshoot would be the best way (for me at least, and maybe you're like me) to stick it to her and remind myself of my worth.

Just because they\u2019re extremely compulsive about X, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the case for Y.\n\nMy mom has OCD and is obsessed with neatness, but can never be on time. In fact, her OCD will actively PREVENT her from being on time. When she\u2019s stressed, as when she\u2019s running late, she needs to do rituals like locking/unlocking/relocking the front door a half-dozen times. OCD is an anxiety disorder, so when she\u2019s under pressure it gets worse. And my mom\u2019s is pretty mild.\n\nThe sister focusing on the mold is very typical of OCD. The problem is that you can\u2019t truly accommodate. Whatever is done, her OCD will find the one less than perfect thing and latch on.

Certainly thats not where her frustration was coming from.", "They do pay me be during the summer. Those funds are institutional and do not come from financial aid.\n\nYeah I guess I could be cleaner. I have been working on several projects at once because of my own personal hobbies. I wanted to clean some of my art stuff out of the way so we could have space. It looked pretty spotless in there. It smelled good. There was no garbage. I cleaned the window and missed a spot, and that was on me. But I am not dirty.
