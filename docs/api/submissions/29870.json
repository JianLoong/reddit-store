My mother (61f) and I have had a challenging relationship for as long as I can remember. I have cut her out of my life for years at a time due to her behavior and poor choices. After not speaking for over 5 years, I finally chose to let her back into my life 2 years ago. I continue to keep her at a distance but we are on good terms. My dad (67m) and I haven\u2019t always been close, but he was by far the better parent in the situation. He is not in great health and I have been trying to spend more time making memories with him.\n\nThe other day I went on a hunting trip with my dad, which I haven\u2019t done since I was a kid. It was nostalgic for me because it was one of the few good things I remember about my childhood. After the hunting trip I posted a few pictures on Facebook (yes, I know it\u2019s archaic but I have never gotten into Instagram) and joked about our failure to shoot anything. My mother immediately comments on the post stating that she was the one who usually went hunting with my dad and that he would only take one of us kids if she couldn\u2019t go. She also said that when she didn\u2019t go she would be back at home making big pots of homemade soups for us.\n\nHere is the problem. She was a severely depressed, bipolar, alcoholic that spent all day, every day in bed. I can count on one hand the number of times I recall her cooking in the kitchen, and she most certainly NEVER went hunting with my dad. \n\nSo here is my question. WIBTA if I respond to her comment and call her out, saying that I remember it very differently? Part of me thinks I should just ignore it and move on, possibly delete her comment, but I also don\u2019t want to let her get away with lying and trying to portray to everyone that she was a good mom when she wasn\u2019t.", "created_utc": 1698509548, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ih25d/wibta_if_i_call_out_my_mother_for_a_blatant_lie/", "score": 163, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You know you, your dad and your mom. Don't bite at her lies, it will drag you back in and is it really worth it? People that know her, know her. Be you. But you are okay to mention down the line you had some great Campbell's soup that reminds you of the way your mom used to open a can:)", "Agree, the assessment should be \"what good things can come from calling her out?\" and likely it's zero. There will almost certainly be negatives though, so just roll on. \n\nPersonally I don't inject time and effort into unnecessary conflict or negative experiences in my life anymore,  but I do know people that can create drama from nothing just because they somehow need it. It feels better to just not be one of those people, but sometimes it infuriates them when you don't take their bait.", "And OP says their mother was an alcoholic. Maybe there is a need for a mental health evaluation.", "this seems like it would be a good approach, although given her history it would likely lead to them going no-contact once again.", "If OPs Mom wasn't doing this for narcissistic or attention seeking or guilty conscience reasons, it could also be a sign of a manic episode. People with severe cases of bipolar disorder often have delusions. In particular, delusions of grandeur are most common (asserting they are the best basketball player in the world when they've trained for 2 weeks, being convinced that in just a few days they'll go from administrative assistant to CEO). This assertion that she was the best mom in the world slaving in the kitchen to make warm homemade soups made from love while her husband and child spent all day outside? Unlikely to be a good sign. \n\nOP is NTA, but I'd call her psychiatrist instead of writing that she's wrong on Facebook.", "NC isn\u2019t a bad thing when folks need to learn how to not disrespect you.

NC isn\u2019t the exception, but the rule!", "Definitely agree with that.", "NTA my mother is exactly the same; depressed, bi-polar, alcoholic, who also slept much of my childhood away. She was either passed out drunk or from opioids. Haven't spoken to her in 20 odd years and just know she'd do the same sort of shit your mother is if I let her back in my life. \nI think from my experience if you want to keep some sort of a relationship with your mother you should either delete her as a contact from Facebook or alter your privacy settings so she only sees posts you want her to. Otherwise you'll constantly be dealing with her bullshit", "YWBTA... Why do that other than to hurt your mom in a public forum? Ask her about it. Maybe she went hunting with him before you can remember?\n\nIn any case, you would be TA to call her out without talking with her about it first. Memories are weird, as in they're not always accurate, but getting clarity from her when these trips \"happened\" and how is a way more reasonable way to behave than calling her out and embarrassing her on Facebook.", "NTA - but it's definitely not worth the mental energy required to address this lie - just delete it, or if you don't want your mother to know there is a setting on Facebook that likes you hide a comment from everyone but the person who commented.", "Personally, I'd just delete the post. If she notices and asks you can decide how far you want to go with it. But at least that lie won't be out there.", "Ignore the post.\nYou say that you're on good terms with your mom currently even though you keep her at a distance. If you post calling out the lie, you're going to blow up that relationship.", "OP, I can see why you feel about your mother the way you do, but I still advise against posting rebuttals to her stories about the old days online. \n\nNot because you'd be in the wrong, but because this just isn't an issue that will be of great interest to people outside your immediate family. Those within the family already know, but people outside the family will... not be impressed that you are attacking your aging mother. And that holds true even when they believe your version of the events in question, which I am sorry to say is not guaranteed.", "hm. i think\u2014and speaking from experience with divorced parents myself and a strained relationship with both\u2014YWBTA if you called her out. the hunting trip and the post were both about making memories with the time your dad has left. don\u2019t sour those memories by letting her get to you\u201a which was probably her intention (assuming that her alcoholism hasn\u2019t completely addled her memories as well and she truly believes that\u2014again\u201a speaking from experience)\n\njust delete the comment and move on. don\u2019t even bring it up to her.\n\nedit: YBTWA not because she doesn\u2019t deserve to be called out\u201a but because it would sour the mood of the post", "Delete the post and repost without her comment. Any times she comments just do it again.", "I wouldn't call her out publicly.  Your other FB friends don't want to see that, and airing your family's dirty laundry will just make you look bad.  If you have issues with the kind of mom she was, I think confronting her face to face would be best.  She deserves a chance to apologize for what she did wrong.  If she was an alcoholic, she may not remember everything, or her mind could be playing tricks on her.  If you call her out privately and she gaslights you, then you'll know that she hasn't changed and can decide if you want to go low contact, no contact or just move on.", "Nta", "I don't suppose there is any space to call her and be like, \"this thing you posted makes me feel bad. I don't want to call you out publicly, but pretending like you were a good mom when, let's be honest, you had your struggles, feels like you are coming into my space and invalidating my experience to my friends... Are you doing this because you feel insecure? Maybe I can get that, but by posting this you are also affecting me, do you get that? And can you maybe take it down?\" \n\nMaybe not... but if I were you I would try and find any way, maybe even a text, to confront her about it privately first. Nothing like this will ever be resolved in a public forum, ever.", "As you probably already know, alcoholism damages the brain, steals and rewrites memories - or totally eliminates them. She could actually believe the narrative she wrote and before then it\u2019s probably the narrative she regretted she not being present to be there for her family, and it might be the cue for a private conversation if and when an opportunity arises. But FB isn\u2019t the place to call her out and shame her.  Remember your original goal is savoring old and making new memories with your dad, and share them with family and friends. When she\u2019s gone you won\u2019t ever have to question or regret calling her out, and in some trickster universe way, you also made a memory with/for her too.", "NTA but it's not worth it.", "I'd say yes you would be, but you're not an asshole for wanting to. But given her age and her past substance abuse It sounds like your mother's mental health might be declining further. I really dont know what you should do but definitely don't try to humiliate or call her out like that. She might not even realize she is not telling the truth.", "Ignore it. Delete it if it really bothers you to have it there, but personally I wouldn\u2019t put any more energy into this.", "It always sucks to see people air their dirty laundry on Facebook.  Delete her comment or ignore it, no one cares if she did or didn't go hunting 30 or 40 years ago.", "I would also limit her posting ability, or even block her from seeing your timeline altogether.", "Why do people feel the need to continue the public bickering? It just feeds it.", "She should be evaluated for Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. I'm trying to get my dad to have my mom evaluated now. It's basically alcohol induced dementia. It fucking blows.", "Often it\u2019s to reset the erroneous narrative started by another. Now, if it\u2019s an ongoing back and forth that\u2019s not good. But I personally believe in people having a voice and not suppressing themselves just for the sake of maintaining a sick and corrosive silence. I hate when the onus of \u201ckeeping the peace\u201d is placed on the abused backs of those who are being assaulted.", "The OP could always say \"Recollections may vary\". A nice way to disagree with her statement.", "That\u2019s a nice, classy way to phrase it when you respect a person and they haven\u2019t emotionally abused you then want you to cosign their delusion. Otherwise, I vote for my original response. Haha!", "<<Recollections may vary\". A nice way to disagree with her statement.>>\n\nThis and tho OP said this stuff didn't happen, it's not like Mother verbally attacked OP and said they didn't go hunting as a child, etc  Or that OP was a liar or anything like that.\n\nI just think should delete comment if they want or just ignore it all together."]}
