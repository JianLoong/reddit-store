My mother (61f) and I have had a challenging relationship for as long as I can remember. I have cut her out of my life for years at a time due to her behavior and poor choices. After not speaking for over 5 years, I finally chose to let her back into my life 2 years ago. I continue to keep her at a distance but we are on good terms. My dad (67m) and I haven\u2019t always been close, but he was by far the better parent in the situation. He is not in great health and I have been trying to spend more time making memories with him.\n\nThe other day I went on a hunting trip with my dad, which I haven\u2019t done since I was a kid. It was nostalgic for me because it was one of the few good things I remember about my childhood. After the hunting trip I posted a few pictures on Facebook (yes, I know it\u2019s archaic but I have never gotten into Instagram) and joked about our failure to shoot anything. My mother immediately comments on the post stating that she was the one who usually went hunting with my dad and that he would only take one of us kids if she couldn\u2019t go. She also said that when she didn\u2019t go she would be back at home making big pots of homemade soups for us.\n\nHere is the problem. She was a severely depressed, bipolar, alcoholic that spent all day, every day in bed. I can count on one hand the number of times I recall her cooking in the kitchen, and she most certainly NEVER went hunting with my dad. \n\nSo here is my question. WIBTA if I respond to her comment and call her out, saying that I remember it very differently? Part of me thinks I should just ignore it and move on, possibly delete her comment, but I also don\u2019t want to let her get away with lying and trying to portray to everyone that she was a good mom when she wasn\u2019t.", "created_utc": 1698509548, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ih25d/wibta_if_i_call_out_my_mother_for_a_blatant_lie/", "score": 76, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You can delete her comment, no problem.  It\u2019s just that, at her age, and with her history, she\u2019s not about to change, and you know what you can (and can\u2019t) expect from her.

She started talking about all the times they went to the beach. \n\nMy aunt hates the ocean. She never took her kids to the beach because she said it was dirty and too hot and she would just be miserable the whole time. She would take them hiking, she would take them to pumpkin patches, she would take them anywhere else but the beach.\n\nShe kept talking about the beach multiple times and eventually they convinced her to go see a doctor. She had early onset dementia. She really believed that they had gone to the beach.

Your mama obviously has lots and lots of problems but you can\u2019t own them, friend.  That\u2019s a losing gig as she is never likely gonna change.  It\u2019s sucks but it is what it is.

This isn\u2019t about revenge, but a way to defend yourself and declutter the emotional mess that she is creating with her lies.\n\n\u201cMom, you are lying. You\u2019ve maybe gone hunting with dad once. You haven\u2019t cooked in our kitchen but a handful of times. I understand that you want people to think you are a great wife and mother but you weren\u2019t. If you want to lie elsewhere that\u2019s your business, but don\u2019t lie under my post.

You know you, your dad and your mom. Don't bite at her lies, it will drag you back in and is it really worth it? People that know her, know her. Be you.

There will almost certainly be negatives though, so just roll on. \n\nPersonally I don't inject time and effort into unnecessary conflict or negative experiences in my life anymore,  but I do know people that can create drama from nothing just because they somehow need it. It feels better to just not be one of those people, but sometimes it infuriates them when you don't take their bait.", "And OP says their mother was an alcoholic. Maybe there is a need for a mental health evaluation.", "this seems like it would be a good approach, although given her history it would likely lead to them going no-contact once again.", "If OPs Mom wasn't doing this for narcissistic or attention seeking or guilty conscience reasons, it could also be a sign of a manic episode. People with severe cases of bipolar disorder often have delusions. In particular, delusions of grandeur are most common (asserting they are the best basketball player in the world when they've trained for 2 weeks, being convinced that in just a few days they'll go from administrative assistant to CEO). This assertion that she was the best mom in the world slaving in the kitchen to make warm homemade soups made from love while her husband and child spent all day outside? Unlikely to be a good sign. \n\nOP is NTA, but I'd call her psychiatrist instead of writing that she's wrong on Facebook.", "NC isn\u2019t a bad thing when folks need to learn how to not disrespect you.
