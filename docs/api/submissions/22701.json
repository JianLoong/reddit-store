The gift of silence from your friend when she blocked you. Leave her to find other \u201cVikings\u201d and this frees you up to find less misguided friends. Win-win!", "NTA, lol. My advice to you is to believe people when they show you who they are. This type of behavior is racist and toxic. Don't associate with people who are that comfortable appropriating culture. Delete these people from your life, you cannot change them.", "NTA she sounds off. I don\u2019t think you need crazy in your life", "NTA but you can\u2019t be \u201cAmerican\u201d unless you\u2019re talking about her nationality.", "NTA. There are certainly cultures not my own that I think are beautiful. They are still not mine. \n\nAs a white American, many of us identify with cultures that our ancestors came from (often whatever culture is associated with current or recent family names if the family has been in the U.S. for enough generations. Which is weird -- often nothing of the culture survives into our day to day lives -- though it makes more sense if your family still practices older ways. So that's one bit where her expectations might have a little bit of societal support.\n\nBut basically if she wants to be Norwegian she should look into moving to Norway and immersing herself in the culture.

I am a white norwegian girl, and this is important information and it will all make sense soon.\n\nAshley called me a few days ago and said she had looked into my culture and she came to the conclusion, she loves it, which made me really happy cause i love when my friends learn about my culture and how i was brought up, just as much as i like learning about theirs. However, she told me she loved it so much, she felt a connection to it. Strange right? She told me, she felt so connected to it, she now identifies as norwegian, and she hopes i support her. I told her, i don\u2019t support her, she can\u2019t just change culture like it\u2019s a gender, and i told her if she really thinks i would support her, she is delusional. She called me an asshole, saying \u201cus vikings should support each other\u201d than blocked me.\n\nIt\u2019s such a stupid thing, i don\u2019t think i am the asshole, but i want outside opinions, just in case.
