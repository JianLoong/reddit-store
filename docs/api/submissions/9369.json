She\u2019s about 2 months old now. Prior to my maternity leave he asked if I  wanted to go to the Maldives on my leave bc there were very good deals. I said no and made it clear I wouldn't want to leave our newborn daughter. \n\nFast forward to now, he spent our reward points without telling me to bid on a vacation to the Maldives. We won. It\u2019s our dream trip. I said no. He's pissed. Reasons I said no: our daughter would be 3-4 months only. It\u2019s a lot to ask of someone else to watch her and god forbid something happens, it\u2019s a 24 hour flight home to get to her. I also just pushed a baby out and am not so fond of my body right now. I offered we could go in the future but the fact that we would only need to pay for airfare is his argument. \n\nHe \"did this for us\" and \"had no idea we would win\". I explained that I made it CLEAR i would not leave our newborn prior to even having her. He argued that he\u2019s turning 30, things are different, etc. etc. and then asked if he could go by himself which set me off because I no longer felt it was for us. At one point he told me that I \u201cnever let him do anything\u201d. I told him he could go but I wouldn\u2019t be here when he got back which may have been a bit harsh. \n\nWhile we had a conversation about all of this and he admitted he was being a bit selfish, he maintains that he is pissed at me for not going and he does not think it\u2019s abnormal for him to want to go by himself. If a sliver of him does think it\u2019s abnormal, he doesn\u2019t care. He thinks the whole thing is doable and even offered to take her with us which I denied because I don\u2019t want to take a newborn on a plane and out of the country. \n\nAITA for putting a stop to this \u201conce in a lifetime\u201d trip? I would be shocked if he did not find this post so here\u2019s to hoping this doesn\u2019t turn into another argument.\n\nEDIT: additional info that he\u2019d probably want me to add: I had a really difficult birth and he was a fantastic partner the first few weeks and mentioned that I\u2019d deserve a trip like this after that difficulty.\n\nFurther edit: he claimed he didn\u2019t know the trip would have to be used before April.", "created_utc": 1675778309, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10w2hew/aita_for_not_going_to_the_maldives_on_maternity/", "score": 69, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He asked you if you would want to go over this specific time. You very clearly said no, with very valid reasons. Your husband then decided to waste the reward points that you've accumulated together to bid on something that you had already told him you did NOT want to do.\n\nNow that he won the auction, he's acting like the victim here. This is beyond the pale. I don't care if he thought he would win the auction or not. Even bidding on it was a huge betrayal. He literally spent your combined vacation currency (points) on a trip he knew you didn't want. \n\nHim going by himself is not a \"compromise\" in any way, shape or form. This is beyond disrespectful of him.", "NTA. Baby > Maldives. I'm disturbed that your husband would even consider going by himself when his brand new daughter is now in his life.  You were definitely not a \"bit harsh\" when you told him that if he went, you and the baby wouldn't be there when he got back--much harsher language would have been appropriate.  Your husband sounds far to immature and selfish to be a father--I hope he shapes up quickly.", "NTA... But I'm gonna recommend some relationship therapy. People usually do stuff like this when they are feeling burnt out or stressed. \n\nThe fact that he's willing to leave you with a newborn or to leave the child suggests he's got something else going on. Perhaps regret, or maybe you all didn't do much during your pregnancy and he just wants a break... Etc.\n\nI do think you are right in not wanting to do the trip. But something else is going on here.", "NTA. No actually means no. You were perfectly clear and up front about it. He's being extraordinarily selfish.", "Tell your husband if he leaves you to go to the beach on the other side of the planet-he can just *stay* there. But you and the three month old aren\u2019t going and there is no way in hell you are leaving her alone, anywhere, at that age. WTF is wrong with him.\n\nYeaaa, you \u201cnever let him do anything\u201d. Tell him you will *let* him talk to a divorce lawyer.\n\nHe *is* \u201cturning thirty\u201d. Things damn well *should* \u201cbe different\u201d. \n\nOP, if you get this straightened out, be on the lookout for his midlife crisis. It might be a doozy. I am so sorry. NTA", "NTA-Did he even want kids? He doesn't seem ready to be a father, even though he is one. He clearly is only thinking about himself.", "NTA and your husband is having a juvenile response to the adjustment of having a family. He wasn't prepared for his life to change the way it did and he's in fight or flight mode. I went through this with my husband and our firstborn as well. Get him to have a conversation about that and then send him away for a weekend with his friends, but make sure you do the same for yourself.", "NTA - you told your husband no. And him thinking leaving you and your newborn (HIS KID TOO) alone for his fun is just absurd.\n\nYour threat that you wouldn't be home, is understandable. Would do the same.", "NTA. You told him you didn\u2019t want to go before he bid and you can do whatever you feel you need to do while on maternity leave. Hopefully he comes around and is able to get the points back or postpone the trip. Sorry you\u2019ve had to deal with this", "NTA.\n\nAnd the edit doesn't make him any less of an AH.  It merely means that he knew all along he wasn't going to accept no for an answer.", "NTA. Leaving aside that your husband didn\u2019t listen when you said no the first time, he should right now be concerning himself with how to be a good parent, not a tropical vacation spot. The Maldives are nice. This is not the moment for the Maldives.", "NTA. It's not just that he's upset about not going on a major vacation during your maternity leave or that he's clueless about what your body has gone through or what he's asking by wanting you to leave a newborn, or his own seeming lack of desire to bond with his child. While selfish, those could maybe be chalked up to spinning a bit at major life changes combined with a healthy dose of ignorance.\n\nIt's that you two had discussed this; you had explained you wouldn't be up to it; and, he went behind your back and bought the trip anyway and is now trying to present it as a fait accompli and use that to pressure you into going. That's more than nerves getting the best of a new dad: That is someone who does not respect your no, does not respect you, and is waving all the red flags.\n\nYou need to be honest with yourself about whether this is a one-off that he ultimately feels bad about and never repeats, or whether he's showing you who he really is. My mom had me with and was married to the latter, and I can promise you that it does not get better over time. Quite the opposite.\n\nEdit: typos", "NTA - but your husband definitely is. I would ask yourself how confident you are raising a child with a man who doesn't seem to prioritize the kid or his wife in anyway. If he's thinking about your parental leave as a chance for a vacation, he is missing the point of parental leave.", "NTA at all.  It concerns me that he\u2019s so uncomprehending about the purpose of maternity/parental leave, about the realities of a 3-4 month old\u2019s needs, and about your experience of your motherhood and your body.  And it\u2019s very concerning that it would become a fight.  Are you and your baby well-supported by others? \nWas he prepared to parent in other ways? Are there other reasons he believes 30 to be lifechanging?", "NTA\n\nHe's making some very immature decisions right now.", "NTA\n\nThere is a big AH in this situation, but it isn't you.", "NTA but your husband is a big time AH. \nYes, you 1000% deserve this vacation, especially since giving birth was difficult for you. But YOU should be able to choose when and where you want to travel. \nAnother point I want to add: what kind of father is ready to \u201cabandon\u201d his (almost) newborn baby just to catch some sun on a tropical island?!\nAnd I don\u2019t believe for a second he didn\u2019t know that the vacation had to be taken by April.", "You guys are still in the bonding stage of having a baby. You need to stay with your newborn until they are at least 6 months in my opinion. Even then i wouldn't want to leave my newborn. \n\nThe only logical thing would be to take your baby with you. It's incredibly insensitive for your husband not to realise you can't be separated from your child when they are so young. \n\nNTA", "NTA sounds like someone is panicking about the realities of starting a family.", "NTA  - this trip was NEVER about you but always about your husband. You were clear with him and he went behind your back and spent the points to \"win\" the trip (I consider this buying, not winning). You are not the selfish one here. He's a terrible example of a dad for this.", "NTA...  No is a complete sentence.    Irrespective of the fact that you said no,  you could've climbed Mt. Everest and this trip is your reward,  if you say no, it means no. \n\nHis not respecting your response, leads me to think he will continue to try manipulating you on more than just a vacation next time. \n\nI agree with you 100%.", "NTA. I absolutely hate it when husbands get angry at their wives when what they are actually angry about is having to be an adult and make responsible decisions. You\u2019re not his mother, he shouldn\u2019t be stomping off in anger because you won\u2019t participate in his irresponsible choice.", "He spent your rewards on a gamble? What if you didn\u2019t \u2018win\u2019? Was he not going to tell you he used your rewards? I\u2019m so confused by this. \n\nNTA. You told him no and he did it anyway. The ask forgiveness later was his downfall. Don\u2019t go on the trip", " NTA. Not in the slightest! You both should be there with your newborn daughter and I\u2019m blown away he doesn\u2019t feel the same.", "Your husband is selfish. You're NTA but he definitely is.\n\n\nMaybe you can cancel his winning bud and get the points refunded?", "NTA\n\nFrom the very moment you said no and he did it anyway, this man showed he doesn't give a flip what YOU want, it's going to be all about him. He wanted the vacation for himself not you, because he knew you didn't want to go.", "NTA. Congratulations on having two children.", "Take the baby, and have the best of both worlds. The baby will love the sun, sea, and sand. Ok it won\u2019t be as relaxing as just the 2 of you but this is your life now and treat it as your first family vacay.", "NTA but maybe you should just go anyway? Take the baby and go. He will see how miserable it is to travel with a baby. He would likely instantly regret his very rash decision. \n\nLeaving a baby that is only a 2 months old home for an extended time with a sitter is not the best thing to do unless you absolutely have to. And this is not an absolutely have to. \n\nHe clearly feels like he needs a break. The resentment for not going and not letting him go will be extensive. You\u2019ll have to deal with the repercussions of this as a couple for a long while.", "I'm not to sure you are being a ass.\n\nI think the pair of you have just hit the baby crunch, life is going to be different from now on, you obviously have a huge new responsibility, and finding time for your self will be hard.\n\nYour husband is obviously struggling with that, and is acting out a little because he is struggling with new dad syndrome.\n\nHowever.\n\nIt is important not to stop doing and experiencing things,  I appreciate right now the nesting instinct is strong, and you don't want to even think of doing anything else. But to some extent it is healthy to actually fight against that a little, since some people simply stop being them themselves and become simply \"mom\" or \"pops\".

I have multiple friends with kids and I know it can take awhile to recover from giving birth. It\u2019s not remotely unreasonable that you don\u2019t want to go. You were very clear with your husband that this was not the time.\n\nYou are also NTA for not wanting him to go alone. There is no way I would feel okay about my husband going on a trip like that without me. I would be hurt if he even wanted to. I would never want to go on a big dream vacation like that without him!

I've been there, and that's something that can take time to recover from, physically and mentally.\n\nHe needs to get his head straight and realise that life is about more than just him now.\n\nEdit: NTA, of course.", "NTA.

At this point I don't even think that he assumed you would come anymore, which basically means he just did this knowing he would get a vacation on his own, while his wife is ALONE with their infant!!!\n\nAlso, it's not safe to leave such a young child alone with somebody else for a vacation. They need their mother's bond. This might screw them up in some way. Good for you for not giving the child away to go on the trip.\n\nYou were WELL within your right to tell him that he can go on the vacation, but he would come home to an empty home, so to speak.

I\u2019m not sure if he knew what it would mean to have kids though..", "He absolutely is scared.

I was with my fiance for 8 months before I got pregnant. \n\nIt was definitely hard but as they get older, you can do more things with them. My kid is 17 months now and we take our kid everywhere because it's fun! \n\nAfter the first year, it'll get better, I promise.
