{"id": 22979, "submission_id": "157rscl", "title": "AITA for bringing my baby to my friend\u2019s wedding after she asked me not to?", "selftext": "One of my very close friends invited me to her wedding which was going to be far from where we live (6.5 hour train journey, then further 2 hour drive on from there). \n\nInvites went out a year in advance and I was pregnant at the time. They asked that children not attend (with a couple of exceptions for family) but stated that babies were allowed to attend. \n\nI knew that we\u2019d be tight for money by the time the wedding rolled around as I would be on maternity leave so I immediately booked the travel, car hire and hotels to make sure we could afford to go. Wedding was in the middle of nowhere so I also wanted to make sure I could stay close to the venue as I\u2019d be travelling with baby. \n\nTwo weeks before the wedding & I meet the bride for coffee (we\u2019ve been busy & not seen each other a few months). \n\nMy son was an early walker, walking at 8 mos. He\u2019s almost a year old when we meet & she comments on how \u201cadvanced\u201d he is for his age. She doesn\u2019t say anything else but later messages to say she didn\u2019t realise my son would be walking already & please could I not bring him to the wedding. \n\nI\u2019m shocked. I booked and paid for the whole trip a year prior and the wedding is now 2 weeks away. \nHe\u2019s still breastfeeding and I\u2019ve never spent a night away from him at this point. As the wedding was so we\u2019d booked two nights near the wedding plus an additional night in the city on the way back. \n\nIf I\u2019d known he wasn\u2019t invited from the start I could have made other arrangements but I have no options now. Plus the accommodation in the area of the venue was now fully booked (the venue is in a fairly remote location) and it\u2019s all non-refundable. \n\nI tell her I\u2019m sorry but I can\u2019t not bring him now with such late notice. She suggests we get a babysitter but it\u2019s super expensive and I\u2019ve never left him with anyone before. I can tell she\u2019s annoyed but she doesn\u2019t say anything else. (NB she and her husband are very wealthy so I\u2019m not sure she understands how tight we are for cash while I\u2019m not working). \n\nWe attend with him and there are about four other babies his age there but none are walking. There are also about three other young children ages approx 4-7. \n\nHe is as good as gold and doesn\u2019t make a peep although I do take him out during the speeches just to be safe.  He\u2019s a great sleeper so I put him to sleep in his pram after dinner and am looking forward to spending a couple hours there before heading back. \n\nHowever, the bride\u2019s mother approaches me immediately after dinner and basically strongly suggests we leave now. I\u2019m really upset by this (we\u2019ve only been there for 3 hours and it\u2019s took 8 hours travel to get there). But I feel unwelcome at this point so we leave. \n\nIt\u2019s kind of ruined our friendship as I feel that she behaved badly. I accept that it\u2019s her wedding and she should be able to specify her wants on her day but I feel like two weeks notice when I had planned carefully so far ahead in order to be able to attend was unfair, especially since other babies were there. \n\nAm I the a-hole?\n\nEDIT: I had to reduce my original word count so I took this out but apparently it\u2019s v relevant:\n\nThe bride also had a baby (around 5/6mos). When we got there the \u201cwedding\u201d we found out it wasn\u2019t a wedding anymore but was now a christening.  We weren\u2019t told this beforehand. \n\nShe didn\u2019t wear a wedding dress and they didn\u2019t even do token vows or walk the aisle (as originally planned. We did know they had gotten legally married in a small service before this). They were calling it a celebration for friends and family. There was a mix of \u201cwedding\u201d speeches after the dinner and a lot of talk about the real wedding that was supposedly wonderful and also had speeches but that most of us hadn\u2019t been invited to.\n\nUPDATE: \nThank you Reddit I appreciate you all so much - even those who don\u2019t agree with me (but actually did read the whole post). I\u2019ve been really feeling horrible about all of this for a long time but I feel much better now and feel like I have some closure on the way the friendship has gone. She\u2019s not a bad person btw - I don\u2019t want her to get totally slammed. I feel she just behaved badly in this instance. It happens, but it also made me realise we don\u2019t see our friendship in the same way as I would have behaved differently and I guess that\u2019s ok, but it\u2019s sad for me. \n\nAnd to clarify for people who have asked/made snide comments: yes I was still breastfeeding at 1 year that\u2019s actually very normal and healthy and breastfeeding is recommended by the WHO until at least 2 years (but I didn\u2019t do it that long and no judgements on anyone who didn\u2019t do that either). Yes he was partially weaned but I suffered really badly from mastitis if I tried to pump or was away from him for long periods of time so it wasn\u2019t as simple as \u201cjust leaving him behind\u201d. \nHe was honestly a super chill baby. He slept well, he was a really happy boy, we were very lucky. I\u2019m not just making it up - he was a a dream baby. Perhaps if he\u2019d been a pain I would feel differently.", "created_utc": 1690149882, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/157rscl/aita_for_bringing_my_baby_to_my_friends_wedding/", "score": 2738, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

(Assuming this was the bride's doing, and not her mother's own idea.)\n\nBut I've read your account of the final pre-wedding conversation between you and the bride, and it doesn't sound like the best, clearest communication in the world:\n\n*I tell her I\u2019m sorry but I can\u2019t not bring him now with such late notice.

Did the bride come away from it with a crystal-clear understanding that **your son would be at the wedding**? Or did she believe that you were grumbling about the babysitter idea, but would try to engage one to make her happy?\n\nYou say you don't think she understands how tight you are for cash. Could it be that the reason she doesn't understand is that you never actually told her?\n\nDid you ever say anything like this? \"Our budget has already hit its limit. We can't afford a babysitter, it's as simple as that. I would be prepared to leave him with a babysitter in a room adjacent to the wedding venue, and pop in and out every so often to make sure he's OK. But I have no funds to pay for that. Are you prepared to pay for it? No? Then I cannot attend your wedding unless I bring my son too. If you refuse him, I'll have to cancel. So, Bride, what's it to be? **Is my son welcome to come with me, or is he not?** Please tell me now, so we're all on the same page.\"\n\nIf you said something like that, and got \"OK, then, he can come\" in reply, you would be NTA.\n\nBut if you just assumed she was OK with it (which I suspect is the case, because you said \"*I can tell she's annoyed but she doesn't say anything else*\"), then you get an AH point as well. Only one, and it's still outweighed by the many AH points I awarded her, but still. You **knew** she didn't like what you were planning to do, at the very least, and it doesn't sound like she agreed to it. Not saying anything isn't agreement.\n\nI suspect your embarrassment and hurt at being asked to leave could have been avoided by clearer communication upfront. By both of you.", "NTA.

You should have been aware that your child would be close to a year old, and that there was a good chance he/she would be crawling and/or walking.  At which stage they are more toddlers than babies and are much more demanding and disruptive than a newborn.  You've had a whole year to organise a babysitter.

My baby was with my partner and his (baby's) uncles (who he has always been close with, there's a sweet photo of my BIL and son napping together while the guys got ready for the wedding). I was able to work knowing my baby was happy and in good hands with people who love him. \n\nAll that to say, just because OP's baby can walk does not mean he isn't a little baby who needs his mom. I know what it takes to prepare to be away from a baby and it is A LOT. I don't think people who don't have kids are able to understand it, not because they aren't smart but because you just don't understand the mental toll and all the effort involved in prepping everyone.

And then rescinded the invite!", "She was specifically told her child was invited, then after everything was booked and planned and only two weeks before the \u201cwedding\u201d told that they were no longer invited", "You did not read my post.", "Right? How can the bride expect you to be there, pay to be there but you\u2019re not allowed to be with your baby who is still BREASTFEEDING and she expects you to leave your son with a stranger for her? All sounds very competitive and entitled. Honestly I\u2019d ask the bride to reimburse me and say buh-bye. OP NTA.", "1 year old is still a baby, so I fail to see the distinction", "That's on the \"bride\" for not being more specific with her rules. \"Baby\" is too vague a definition when you're going to be a stickler for details like she was. \n\n\"No kids between six months and 8 years\" would've been more clear, IMO.", "yeah, no, fuck that. you don't get to tell someone they can do something then change your mind with barely two weeks notice. unless she offered to cover the cost of last minute child care, the bride can get lost.", "This story is bonkers but I want to know more hahahaha", "And you still brought him. You don't see how that would be rude?\n\nListen, if it were me I would just have a place people can put their kids during the wedding because I can see how you can't always just get rid of your kid.\n\nThey really didn't handle it well but that doesn't deminish the fact not just you but several people felt they could just disregard stipulations and bring them kids anyway. I totally get why she would feel a type of way.", "But also... most 8 months olds cannot walk! They can maybe stand but walking is more 1 year territory.", "No all the kids and babies that were there were invited. It was literally only mine she didn\u2019t want there because he was walking earlier than she thought he would. Not diminishing your point if you still feel that way but just to be clear about what actually happened.", "The lucky ones are those that have a loooong period where the baby can sit but is not yet mobile.", "My son started walking at 10 months \ud83e\udd37 he was the first of our mothers group because he was so damn stubborn lol. \n\nHe's been great at the 3 weddings we've been to though - from age 2.5-3.5 now.\n\nBut how confusing for OP when they were invited to a wedding that turned into a christening and then was told to leave ??\n\nOP this isn't a friend you want around anymore, don't lose sleep over her!", "I was almost 2 before I started walking (I preferred to scoot around on my butt everywhere) while my brother was an early walker like OP's kid.\n\nYou're right about not knowing when a kid will hit a certain milestone.", "Exactly.   And it seems like the brides mother might be the biggest AH in that family.", "I was an advanced baby and gifted child, but now I'm an adult useless sack of dog shit. So it doesn't mean much lol", "\ud83e\udd23 my brothers would feed our vcrs sandwiches , my mom became an expert at fishing them out", "I did the same \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Ah yes that\u2019s what I came here to say as well. I spoke, walked and swam very early. But then I didn\u2019t learn how to ride a bike until 7, mostly because of refusal. I didn\u2019t want to and the more people tried to force me the more I refused. And I have AuDHD so I was late with plenty of things and now I\u2019m fully disabled and unable to function on my own."]}
