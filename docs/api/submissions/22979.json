{"id": 22979, "submission_id": "157rscl", "title": "AITA for bringing my baby to my friend\u2019s wedding after she asked me not to?", "selftext": "One of my very close friends invited me to her wedding which was going to be far from where we live (6.5 hour train journey, then further 2 hour drive on from there). \n\nInvites went out a year in advance and I was pregnant at the time. They asked that children not attend (with a couple of exceptions for family) but stated that babies were allowed to attend. \n\nI knew that we\u2019d be tight for money by the time the wedding rolled around as I would be on maternity leave so I immediately booked the travel, car hire and hotels to make sure we could afford to go. Wedding was in the middle of nowhere so I also wanted to make sure I could stay close to the venue as I\u2019d be travelling with baby. \n\nTwo weeks before the wedding & I meet the bride for coffee (we\u2019ve been busy & not seen each other a few months). \n\nMy son was an early walker, walking at 8 mos. He\u2019s almost a year old when we meet & she comments on how \u201cadvanced\u201d he is for his age. She doesn\u2019t say anything else but later messages to say she didn\u2019t realise my son would be walking already & please could I not bring him to the wedding. \n\nI\u2019m shocked. I booked and paid for the whole trip a year prior and the wedding is now 2 weeks away. \nHe\u2019s still breastfeeding and I\u2019ve never spent a night away from him at this point. As the wedding was so we\u2019d booked two nights near the wedding plus an additional night in the city on the way back. \n\nIf I\u2019d known he wasn\u2019t invited from the start I could have made other arrangements but I have no options now. Plus the accommodation in the area of the venue was now fully booked (the venue is in a fairly remote location) and it\u2019s all non-refundable. \n\nI tell her I\u2019m sorry but I can\u2019t not bring him now with such late notice. She suggests we get a babysitter but it\u2019s super expensive and I\u2019ve never left him with anyone before. I can tell she\u2019s annoyed but she doesn\u2019t say anything else. (NB she and her husband are very wealthy so I\u2019m not sure she understands how tight we are for cash while I\u2019m not working). \n\nWe attend with him and there are about four other babies his age there but none are walking. There are also about three other young children ages approx 4-7. \n\nHe is as good as gold and doesn\u2019t make a peep although I do take him out during the speeches just to be safe.  He\u2019s a great sleeper so I put him to sleep in his pram after dinner and am looking forward to spending a couple hours there before heading back. \n\nHowever, the bride\u2019s mother approaches me immediately after dinner and basically strongly suggests we leave now. I\u2019m really upset by this (we\u2019ve only been there for 3 hours and it\u2019s took 8 hours travel to get there). But I feel unwelcome at this point so we leave. \n\nIt\u2019s kind of ruined our friendship as I feel that she behaved badly. I accept that it\u2019s her wedding and she should be able to specify her wants on her day but I feel like two weeks notice when I had planned carefully so far ahead in order to be able to attend was unfair, especially since other babies were there. \n\nAm I the a-hole?", "created_utc": 1690149882, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/157rscl/aita_for_bringing_my_baby_to_my_friends_wedding/", "score": 38, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Like you said, if you\u2019d known about this from the start you would have made the appropriate arrangements. If she meant non-mobile babies only she should have said that. But she didn\u2019t. \n\nIt was really rotten of her to send her mom to kick you out over it. I understand this was a stress point for the bride, but kicking someone out over a sleeping baby is just pettiness.", "NTA.

Most of them are there for the free food and open bar. Ten years later, the bride won't care. The groom probably never cared. The people the bride is trying to impress won't remember.

I typically agree with the bride when they say no children however, she made a last-minute change just two weeks before the wedding, well after you had already made all of your travel plans, and that was a really shitty thing to do. I absolutely understand not wanting small children running around during the reception, parents tend to ignore their kids, but if he was as good as you say he was then she\u2019s the AH here.

Also, what a weird rule. I completely understand childfree weddings but no kids allowed except babies and small children? And this specific baby isn\u2019t allowed to be there when there are others of the same age in attendance?", "NTA.

(Assuming this was the bride's doing, and not her mother's own idea.)\n\nBut I've read your account of the final pre-wedding conversation between you and the bride, and it doesn't sound like the best, clearest communication in the world:\n\n*I tell her I\u2019m sorry but I can\u2019t not bring him now with such late notice. She suggests we get a babysitter but it\u2019s super expensive and I\u2019ve never left him with anyone before. I can tell she\u2019s annoyed but she doesn\u2019t say anything else. (NB she and her husband are very wealthy so I\u2019m not sure she understands how tight we are for cash while I\u2019m not working).*\n\nHow exactly did this conversation end? Did the bride come away from it with a crystal-clear understanding that **your son would be at the wedding**? Or did she believe that you were grumbling about the babysitter idea, but would try to engage one to make her happy?\n\nYou say you don't think she understands how tight you are for cash. Could it be that the reason she doesn't understand is that you never actually told her?\n\nDid you ever say anything like this? \"Our budget has already hit its limit. We can't afford a babysitter, it's as simple as that. I would be prepared to leave him with a babysitter in a room adjacent to the wedding venue, and pop in and out every so often to make sure he's OK. But I have no funds to pay for that. Are you prepared to pay for it? No? Then I cannot attend your wedding unless I bring my son too. If you refuse him, I'll have to cancel. So, Bride, what's it to be? **Is my son welcome to come with me, or is he not?** Please tell me now, so we're all on the same page.\"\n\nIf you said something like that, and got \"OK, then, he can come\" in reply, you would be NTA.\n\nBut if you just assumed she was OK with it (which I suspect is the case, because you said \"*I can tell she's annoyed but she doesn't say anything else*\"), then you get an AH point as well. Only one, and it's still outweighed by the many AH points I awarded her, but still. You **knew** she didn't like what you were planning to do, at the very least, and it doesn't sound like she agreed to it. Not saying anything isn't agreement.\n\nI suspect your embarrassment and hurt at being asked to leave could have been avoided by clearer communication upfront. By both of you.", "NTA.

I would be strongly tempted to send her a bill for your trouble. What a piece of work this \"friend\" is.", "ESH. She can have the rule about not having kids at her wedding, and she can ask you to not bring her son, and both of those are okay. But to do so at such short notice when she knew that you had planned everything around bringing him is an AH move.\n\nBut that still makes you the AH for ignoring her very specific request. She told you not to bring him, you did. If nothing was refundable, you could've used the trip as a holiday and done your own thing with your family so it wouldn't go to waste.\n\nYou were both inconsiderate of the other.", "YTA. You knew upfront that this wedding was not completely child friendly and you made nonrefundable arrangements. Then you didn\u2019t communicate very clearly with the bride all along to make sure things were going well.  You really could have gotten a babysitter, it would have been cheaper than losing the money you spent on travel arrangements.  In the end what happened was that the bride meant it when she said your child was not welcome.", "I guess they\u2019re mad about paying for another child or person at the wedding when they\u2019re not really on the list. Idk I\u2019m just speculating, you\u2019re helpless here. You kinda are an AH but also not at the same time. It\u2019s weird.", "NTA people who say no children allowed are the AH.

You didn't want her to be mad nor think of you as being petty .... so you went against the \"no\"?  You didn't think that would cause an issue at least as bad as being mad or think you being petty?"]}
