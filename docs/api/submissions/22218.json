She missed no time off school and it didn\u2019t effect her contact with her dad. We have a child arrangements order and legally I\u2019m allowed to take my daughter anywhere without permission or notice as long as it doesn\u2019t effect contact. (I checked with a solicitor) \n\nWhen I booked the holiday I sent a WhatsApp message to my daughters dad to tell him I was taking her on holiday. I gave the dates, the location and travel details. There is a big but, I know he has me blocked on WhatsApp so I knew he\u2019d never see the message. \n\nI knew if he knew he\u2019d kick off and try and ruin our holiday. I know I\u2019m not legally obligated to tell him about our holiday, but I thought it would help the situation if I could say, well I did send him the details. \n\nAnyway we get to France and we\u2019re having a great time. My daughter decided to call her dad for a chat. I told her she can tell him whatever she likes (it\u2019s up to her if she tells him we\u2019re on holiday) but I did warn her that he probably doesn\u2019t know and might be unhappy. \n\nPart way through the call she mentions we\u2019re in France and he goes ballistic. Screaming, shouting etc.. he demanded to speak to me. I got on the phone, but couldn\u2019t get a word in for all the screaming so I ended the call. \n\nHe starts blowing up mine & my daughters phone demanding we return to the UK immediately. He was threatening to have me arrested for abduction etc\u2026\n\nI calmly sent him a message stating we are on holiday, we\u2019ll be home before he is due to see daughter and that daughter is happy, healthy and enjoying a holiday. I told him that he\u2019s welcome to call and text her but please not stop screaming & shouting as it\u2019s distressing her. \n\nHe text back calling me an AH and saying he\u2019ll see me in court. \n\nAITA?\n\nETA - Whenever my ex doesn\u2019t like something he keeps our daughter and refuses to return her. I\u2019m then forced to apply to the court (That costs \u00a3300 fyi) then just before court or once we\u2019ve missed whatever he intended to ruin he brings her back. The court the say there is no issue and life resumes.  It\u2019s a terrible system, but it\u2019s what we have so I deal with it.\n\nHe has pretty minimal contact as it is (2 weekends a month) I have a non molestation order against him, but we can communicate about our daughter and obviously I have to see him at handovers. He has me blocked on every platform, but he unblocks me whenever he wants, then blocks again. (My daughter has her own phone that she called him from) \n\nI understand nothing about this situation is ideal, my daughter has begged me for 2 years to go to Disneyland and I so badly wanted to make this dream possible for her. I\u2019m pretty sick of living a life where so much is controlled by my ex, this is the first time I\u2019ve really gone against him and decided to just do what I wanted.", "created_utc": 1689344840, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14zhwfb/aita_for_taking_my_daughter_out_of_the_country/", "score": 18, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s clear you\u2019re the main carer of your child and he sees her two weekends a month. He\u2019s the one who blocked you from messaging him. It didn\u2019t impact his time with her. You know him better than we ever will and so you\u2019ll be best placed to know how he\u2019ll react and what he would do if he didn\u2019t get his way. He\u2019s an angry child who will stamp his feet and cause problems. You\u2019ve already said there have been times when he\u2019s refused to bring her back as agreed.

You\u2019ve acted within the law, sought advice before you\u2019ve gone and messaged him directly to say you were going.

Him for his anger, his abuse and skirting the legality around the custody agreement by keeping her longer to get his way unless the courts are called. He sounds terrible and abusive, especially if you have a non-molestation order on him (like, what?)\n\nBut you ALSO suck. I don't know whether you are so traumatized by his abuse that it's affected your ability to parent, but from all of this, it seems like you...really don't care about your daughter much at all and are more concerned with how this affects you. You seem so numb to the abuse your daughter is sustaining from your ex (the yelling, the kidnapping, and who knows what he's doing when he has her). You allow HER to experience his rage and have to tell him about the trip. You think him having so much custody time even after kidnapping and his anger issues is totally fine. You are more concerned with having to confront him than having your daughter confront him. You're also fine with the possibility of him taking her out of country and not knowing where.\n\nIt's all just....very, very sad and scary. If this is all true and you were affected by his abuse, you need help because as much as you downplay your daughter's feelings in all of this, it only makes logical sense that she's affected by both of your actions way worse than you know. His anger and your lack of protection and acceptance of all of this is affecting her long-term.\n\nI just feel so bad for this little girl, who legally has eight more years of this bullshit to deal with.", "YTA, you\u2019re playing games and using your kid as a pawn. You sent him a message to say you did knowing that he would not get it. You\u2019d be just as pissed if he took her out of the country without your knowledge. Poor kid.", "NTA In the US you could still be in the same state with the short distance you traveled. Going from country to country isn't a big deal in Europe and your ex completely overreacted. You should look forward to your opportunity to demonstrate to the court that he verbally abused you and your daughter over actions that were well within your custody agreement.", "YTA you deliberately told him in a way you knew he wouldn't see which is shady.\n\nYou then put your own daughter in the firing line. Telling a 10 year old \"well you can tell him if you want but it might make him unhappy\" is a really shitty thing to do. It doesn't stop her from having to deal with the fallout but it makes her feel like it's her fault he's angry rather than yours. You're basically giving her the choice of lying to her dad or making him angry\n\nYou claim that it was the only way you'd get the holiday but you're also claim you have the legal right to take her so what exactly are you claiming he would do to stop you?\n\nYour paragraph shows you being manipulative towards your ex and towards your own child so forgive me if I don't exactly trust that you're not also trying to manipulate us as well", "As long as your solicitor said it was okay, you're good imo. Enjoy your trip! NTA", "YTA. \n\nThis is one of those situations where you may \"legally\" be entitled to do what you did, but its a shitty co-parenting thing to do.  The fact that you purposely sent a message in a way where you knew you wouldn't be seen as a way to have plausible deniability is really what puts this over the top for me. \n\nYour daughter and her dad seem to have a decent relationship that you want to interfere in.

YTA.\n\nYou're using your daughter as a pawn to keep pissing off your ex, it seems. You knew she'd mention France. You knew he'd be pissed.

Op stated that dad would sabotage if he knew beforehand and not return their daughter.", "Just to appease all those outraged here:\n\nINFO: could you describe more about your co-parenting relationship with the father? You have said he would have refused to return her to ruin the holiday and that he became verbally abusive when he found out, which seems like a pattern of behaviour as you warned your daughter about it. Is this behaviour indicative of why the relationship broke down and how he generally engages in co-parenting?", "You are legally allowed to take her? He sounds abusive and unhinged. NTA", "NTAH From what I understand leaving the country is much more normalized in Europe, which makes sense why you had legal rights to take her without his permission. If you knew he would react unfairly and you don't have to tell him, you shouldn't give him the power to start the fight. Your daughter seemed fine with it and I think she is old enough to decide if she wants to go on Holiday.", "This would be illegal in other countries.  Not sure what the UK has to say about it.

You sound like such a shitty person. I hope your daughter grows up knowing not to be like either of you. You should have told him ahead of time, in a form that you knew he would receive, not one that you knew he would not receive. You should have had the conversation with him and then when he blew up about it, you could have simply told him that if this was how we was going to be about it then you were going to block his number for the week so that he is not ruining things and then just unblock his number when the vacation is done. But you chose to be just as shitty about things as he did.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit to add. \n\nYou came on here asking if you are the AH or not and the verdict seems to be tha you are the AH so why come on here to ask that just to keep arguing that you are right and he is wrong?", "NTA you have primary custody so can do as you see fit, if he takes it to court make sure to bring screenshots and a witness testimony of the abuse he\u2019s given, so he can lose even more access", "NTA To me, the ah is always going to be the person who blocks the person they co-parent with. Hope you enjoy your vacation", "NTA. Try to record his outbursts of verbal abuse so you have more evidence of his poor anger management and controlling tendencies.

Ideally I would have called, emailed or text once we got to France, but that\u2019s impossible.", "Given the context, I would argue OP is in the clear morally. All of her actions that would otherwise be questionable can be directly traced to mitigating damage from the ex's clearly reprehensible behavior.", "Right? OP sounds like a teenager trying to justify sneaking out to party all night.", "I have no doubt about the source of his anger, and I'm certain you felt what you were doing was right.  But turn it around.  Do you want him to do this same thing to you?  Because you've set a precedent for him just bouncing off with her to wherever and not telling you.  And you've set a precedent for her that it's okay when a parent does that.", "And then you would have had legal recourse for a kidnapping charge. The bottom line is you lied because you can't handle your own shit and put your kid in the middle of it, then you pretend dad's the bad guy for yelling and \"distressing\" her when you're the one who put her in this situation to begin with.", "Kept her when/how? You didn't have to tell him while she was with him. Call/text him the morning you are leaving and give him a heads up.", "So I should have told her to lie?", "The point isn't that you can get there quickly, it's that you won't know where to look. If he has her in your area, then you can go to the local police to for help. If she's in another part of the world, you're good and fucked. That's why he's so angry.", ">Unfortunately I have no way to communicate with him other than in person. Ideally I would have called, emailed or text once we got to France, but that\u2019s impossible.\n\nUm, really?  Because your daughter was on a call with him.  This isn't adding up.", "It doesn't sound fine if he's being emotionally abusive toward your daughter (forcing her to stay with him until court is threatened). If this is all true, what he's doing IS affecting your daughter in a negative way and that is not ok. She witnesses his anger and his abuse and that is not fine. But I do understand the poor system and it sucks that there may not be a lot you can do. But it is something to note that your daughter is 10 and his anger is affecting your entire family. If you're too afraid to let him know of a simple trip because of his anger, that will only escalate as she gets older and becomes more independent.\n\nSince your daughter DID have a way to communicate with him, you should have taken the phone from her to tell him yourself. You did have ways to communicate if he was blowing up her phone and yours, so I don't buy that last part.", "It clearly wasn\u2019t impossible as she was able to call him.", "> My daughter decided to call her dad for a chat.\n\nYour daughter was able to call him. You could have had her call and say, \"Mom needs to talk to you.\" The way you handled this makes YTA. Really, excepting your daughter, ESH.", "I\u2019ve said it before, I have no issue with him taking our daughter on holiday. Obviously I\u2019d like to know where she is, but I don\u2019t know where she is when she\u2019s with him, so it\u2019s not any different.", "No I wouldn\u2019t. It doesn\u2019t work like that. I added an update, maybe that\u2019ll explain it better.", "Nope, you should have acted like an adult and communicated with her father.", "He takes her out of our area without telling me and I don\u2019t demand to know where they are.", "She has her own phone.", "...that's not cool either, OP.  Not cool at all.  I'm not a parent, I have \\*ZERO\\* maternal instinct, and I would be FRANTIC if I didn't know where a kid I was responsible for was or even if they were in the country.  Jesus.  What the FUCK, lady??", "Then we simply would never be able to go on holiday.", "And you could have used that.", "Oh trust me at first it was hell. I drove myself crazy not sleeping, not eating when I didn\u2019t know where she was\u2026 I called police, I went to the courts, I called everyone he knew\u2026 but social services & the courts don\u2019t like that. To them it\u2019s perfectly reasonable for you to not know where your child is if they\u2019re with the other parent. It took me years to accept. But I guess it\u2019s just normal to me now. I\u2019m still highly stressed when I don\u2019t know where she is, but there is literally nothing I can do about it.", "Stop being dramatic. Your child is suffering for your lack of communication with your ex. You could have and should have called him when you arrived. You instead made your child take the brunt of your choices.
