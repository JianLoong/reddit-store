She missed no time off school and it didn\u2019t effect her contact with her dad. We have a child arrangements order and legally I\u2019m allowed to take my daughter anywhere without permission or notice as long as it doesn\u2019t effect contact. (I checked with a solicitor) \n\nWhen I booked the holiday I sent a WhatsApp message to my daughters dad to tell him I was taking her on holiday. I gave the dates, the location and travel details. There is a big but, I know he has me blocked on WhatsApp so I knew he\u2019d never see the message. \n\nI knew if he knew he\u2019d kick off and try and ruin our holiday. I know I\u2019m not legally obligated to tell him about our holiday, but I thought it would help the situation if I could say, well I did send him the details. \n\nAnyway we get to France and we\u2019re having a great time. My daughter decided to call her dad for a chat. I told her she can tell him whatever she likes (it\u2019s up to her if she tells him we\u2019re on holiday) but I did warn her that he probably doesn\u2019t know and might be unhappy. \n\nPart way through the call she mentions we\u2019re in France and he goes ballistic. Screaming, shouting etc.. he demanded to speak to me. I got on the phone, but couldn\u2019t get a word in for all the screaming so I ended the call. \n\nHe starts blowing up mine & my daughters phone demanding we return to the UK immediately. He was threatening to have me arrested for abduction etc\u2026\n\nI calmly sent him a message stating we are on holiday, we\u2019ll be home before he is due to see daughter and that daughter is happy, healthy and enjoying a holiday. I told him that he\u2019s welcome to call and text her but please not stop screaming & shouting as it\u2019s distressing her. \n\nHe text back calling me an AH and saying he\u2019ll see me in court. \n\nAITA?\n\nETA - Whenever my ex doesn\u2019t like something he keeps our daughter and refuses to return her. I\u2019m then forced to apply to the court (That costs \u00a3300 fyi) then just before court or once we\u2019ve missed whatever he intended to ruin he brings her back. The court the say there is no issue and life resumes.  It\u2019s a terrible system, but it\u2019s what we have so I deal with it.\n\nHe has pretty minimal contact as it is (2 weekends a month) I have a non molestation order against him, but we can communicate about our daughter and obviously I have to see him at handovers. He has me blocked on every platform, but he unblocks me whenever he wants, then blocks again. (My daughter has her own phone that she called him from) \n\nI understand nothing about this situation is ideal, my daughter has begged me for 2 years to go to Disneyland and I so badly wanted to make this dream possible for her. I\u2019m pretty sick of living a life where so much is controlled by my ex, this is the first time I\u2019ve really gone against him and decided to just do what I wanted.", "created_utc": 1689344840, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14zhwfb/aita_for_taking_my_daughter_out_of_the_country/", "score": 364, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You know him better than we ever will and so you\u2019ll be best placed to know how he\u2019ll react and what he would do if he didn\u2019t get his way. He\u2019s an angry child who will stamp his feet and cause problems. You\u2019ve already said there have been times when he\u2019s refused to bring her back as agreed. In a previous post you\u2019ve also said he\u2019s befriended a man who raped you, after knowing he\u2019d raped you! \n\nSorry to say but he\u2019s brought this on himself by not parenting properly at all and trying to control everything. \n\nI\u2019m in the UK myself and I know popping to France is neither here nor there. You\u2019ve acted within the law, sought advice before you\u2019ve gone and messaged him directly to say you were going. He would\u2019ve absolutely ruined it and it\u2019s his own fault for blocking the mother of his child from messaging him. \n\nGiven all this context you\u2019re NTA but you did chuck your daughter under the bus a bit. Having said that, he shouldn\u2019t be shouting at anyone here. His behaviour sucks and if he\u2019d not acted this way, he\u2019d have been very aware that you\u2019d gone. Also, why the hell wouldn\u2019t you want your child to have a nice holiday?", "ALSO DEPENDS WHAT PART OF WARZONE FRANE", "~~E S H~~ - So, after reading the post and replies, assuming this is all correct, I think both of you suck because of how it's affecting your daughter. Him for his anger, his abuse and skirting the legality around the custody agreement by keeping her longer to get his way unless the courts are called. He sounds terrible and abusive, especially if you have a non-molestation order on him (like, what?)\n\nBut you ALSO suck. I don't know whether you are so traumatized by his abuse that it's affected your ability to parent, but from all of this, it seems like you...really don't care about your daughter much at all and are more concerned with how this affects you. You seem so numb to the abuse your daughter is sustaining from your ex (the yelling, the kidnapping, and who knows what he's doing when he has her). You allow HER to experience his rage and have to tell him about the trip. You think him having so much custody time even after kidnapping and his anger issues is totally fine. You are more concerned with having to confront him than having your daughter confront him. You're also fine with the possibility of him taking her out of country and not knowing where.\n\nIt's all just....very, very sad and scary. If this is all true and you were affected by his abuse, you need help because as much as you downplay your daughter's feelings in all of this, it only makes logical sense that she's affected by both of your actions way worse than you know. His anger and your lack of protection and acceptance of all of this is affecting her long-term.\n\nI just feel so bad for this little girl, who legally has eight more years of this bullshit to deal with.\n\n*ETA: Because of a lot more clarifications in the replies and comments, especially the admission of a mistake for her daughter's role in this, I am switching it to NTA because it's a very clear abusive situation that OP is currently stuck in. Which is what I suspected, but definitely didn't know HOW bad until further comments.", "YTA, you\u2019re playing games and using your kid as a pawn. You sent him a message to say you did knowing that he would not get it. You\u2019d be just as pissed if he took her out of the country without your knowledge. Poor kid.", "NTA In the US you could still be in the same state with the short distance you traveled. Going from country to country isn't a big deal in Europe and your ex completely overreacted. You should look forward to your opportunity to demonstrate to the court that he verbally abused you and your daughter over actions that were well within your custody agreement.", "YTA you deliberately told him in a way you knew he wouldn't see which is shady.\n\nYou then put your own daughter in the firing line. Telling a 10 year old \"well you can tell him if you want but it might make him unhappy\" is a really shitty thing to do. It doesn't stop her from having to deal with the fallout but it makes her feel like it's her fault he's angry rather than yours. You're basically giving her the choice of lying to her dad or making him angry\n\nYou claim that it was the only way you'd get the holiday but you're also claim you have the legal right to take her so what exactly are you claiming he would do to stop you?\n\nYour paragraph shows you being manipulative towards your ex and towards your own child so forgive me if I don't exactly trust that you're not also trying to manipulate us as well", "As long as your solicitor said it was okay, you're good imo. Enjoy your trip! NTA", "YTA. \n\nThis is one of those situations where you may \"legally\" be entitled to do what you did, but its a shitty co-parenting thing to do.  The fact that you purposely sent a message in a way where you knew you wouldn't be seen as a way to have plausible deniability is really what puts this over the top for me. \n\nYour daughter and her dad seem to have a decent relationship that you want to interfere in. That is shitty", "YTA shocking coparenting on your part. And worse you made your daughter tell him??! Couldn\u2019t have the adult conversation yourself. Jeez.", "Your behaviour is... YTA.\n\nYou're using your daughter as a pawn to keep pissing off your ex, it seems. You knew she'd mention France. You knew he'd be pissed. You knew this would blow up and chose not to deal with it as an adult, but by sending a plausible deniability whatsapp message so you'd have an excuse.\n\nWhat the everlasting f?

Op stated that dad would sabotage if he knew beforehand and not return their daughter.", "Edit: NTA. He has a pattern of not returning your daughter in retaliation if things don\u2019t go his way and you have the equivalent of a restraining order against him for his behaviour towards you. You are primary parent and he has her only 2 weekends a month. In an ideal world, you would have told him and he would have co-operated, but when you\u2019re dealing with people who have a history of abuse and particularly in abusing the system in their favour, ideal goes out the window and you do what you need to do to live your life without continuing to be victimised. \n\nJust to appease all those outraged here:\n\nI N F O: could you describe more about your co-parenting relationship with the father? You have said he would have refused to return her to ruin the holiday and that he became verbally abusive when he found out, which seems like a pattern of behaviour as you warned your daughter about it. Is this behaviour indicative of why the relationship broke down and how he generally engages in co-parenting?", "You are legally allowed to take her? He sounds abusive and unhinged. NTA", "NTAH From what I understand leaving the country is much more normalized in Europe, which makes sense why you had legal rights to take her without his permission. If you knew he would react unfairly and you don't have to tell him, you shouldn't give him the power to start the fight. Your daughter seemed fine with it and I think she is old enough to decide if she wants to go on Holiday.", "This would be illegal in other countries.  Not sure what the UK has to say about it.   Even if you aren't \"abducting\" her, it's in the best interest of your child for her other legal guardian knows where she is in case of emergencies.\n\nSo yeah, YTA.", "ESH.

OP and the bio dad both sound like babies who are not mustering the maturity warranted\u2014based on what is presented.", "Legally you did nothing wrong and yeah, your ex-husband is an ass but that doesn't automatically mean that you are not. You sound like such a shitty person. I hope your daughter grows up knowing not to be like either of you. You should have told him ahead of time, in a form that you knew he would receive, not one that you knew he would not receive. You should have had the conversation with him and then when he blew up about it, you could have simply told him that if this was how we was going to be about it then you were going to block his number for the week so that he is not ruining things and then just unblock his number when the vacation is done. But you chose to be just as shitty about things as he did.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit to add. \n\nYou came on here asking if you are the AH or not and the verdict seems to be tha you are the AH so why come on here to ask that just to keep arguing that you are right and he is wrong?", "NTA you have primary custody so can do as you see fit, if he takes it to court make sure to bring screenshots and a witness testimony of the abuse he\u2019s given, so he can lose even more access", "NTA To me, the ah is always going to be the person who blocks the person they co-parent with. Hope you enjoy your vacation", "NTA. Try to record his outbursts of verbal abuse so you have more evidence of his poor anger management and controlling tendencies.

If he's comfortable to scream at his daughter on the phone, what is he doing when OP isn't there?\n\nAnd OP not wanting to tell her ex about the trip and goes through extreme measures to not do it directly/not deal with his rage but allows their daughter to do it is extremely concerning.", "> and I have a non molestation order against him.\n\nUh, yeah, ok, THIS one needs to be explained now because....what?

That really sucks.", "Well he could grow up and un block her number\u2026", "If something happened, it\u2019s not the fathers job to \u201cstart looking.\u201d That\u2019s stupid, the dad is not a police officer or an investigator. \n\nAlso, if something did happen, it\u2019s pretty obvious OP doesn\u2019t need or want the ex \u201ccoming to their aid.\u201d If something happens, that sucks, but he\u2019ll be visiting his kid in the hospital or whatever like all the other non-custodial parents that aren\u2019t around when something bad happens. \n\nHe lost the right to be ever-present in their lives, according to the court. This is part of the consequences of divorce and split custody.", "The father doesn\u2019t sound like someone who\u2019d come looking. Or care. But if he did, he could just unblock her number like a fucking adult human being", "Uhhh, surely she has friends and family who know what's going on. His past behavior has indicated that it's not his place to be the one leading the charge should something happen to them.", "*English Channel. Not the North Sea", "Yeah it's quicker for me to get to France where I live in the UK than it is to get to Wales. You could if you wanted, have a day trip to France if you're in the south of the UK \n\nI miss the duty free from the good old 90s", "You put your daughter in the line of fire instead of handling it between adults. He blew up and yelled at her, then at you with her present, *while you were on your holiday.* \n\nThat sounds super relaxing and fun. /s\n\nIt sucks, but you don\u2019t put your kid in a position to be in the middle. And your excuse of sending him the info on a blocked app is childish and frankly so passive aggressive. \n\nYou can\u2019t control how your ex acts. You can only control how you act and how you protect your daughter. You didn\u2019t do that here.", "How did that go for you? If you allow the daughter to talk to the father on holiday it was bound to come out. So much unnecessary drama.", "I don\u2019t think she\u2019s wrong for wanting to have this experience with her child but everything seems so irresponsible about this post. She could have told him in person after picking the daughter up right before they left. I\u2019m sure there are plenty of scenarios of \u201ccould haves\u201d that would have been better than the daughter taking the brunt of his rage. Which he clearly is the asshole here, too. I should have put ESH - ha. I think neither of the parents are particularly thinking about how this impacts the child. OP knew dad would blow up, yet allowed the daughter to make that call instead of getting in front of the situation. Dad holds the child hostage until right before court, it\u2019s all terrible honestly. \n\nMy opinion remains the same, you can\u2019t just take a child abroad without both parents knowing unless he doesn\u2019t have rights as a parent. Again, it\u2019s so irresponsible.", "Yeah so she added that information AFTER her original post and after i gave my answer.   I gave my answer based on the information she gave in the OP.", "Wonderful, great that you have family who are able to help and are willing to do so! That is such a relief.\n\nSo, if he refuses to keep a channel open, every single consequence of this is his fault. I'm sure his daughter will not appreciate this attitude once she gets older and understands more of what is going on.\n\nIn the long run it's his loss and your gain.\n\nJust hang in there and keep the faith - from one single mother to another.\n\nI send you lots of positive energy!!", "She said repeatedly that she didn't need to tell him. So she could've just not told him. Or, you know, use the phone his daughter used to tell him. \n\nThe issue is that OP put her daughter in position to be screamed at by an abusive ass when there was absolutely no reason that needed to happen.", "Yes, if the dad is gonna ruin everything, every time, daughter needs to learn sooner rather than later, that dad is on an info diet.", "I mean, yes? Many times, it is safer to lie to abusers.", "If one parent leaves the country, the other partner has to agree to take the child there. Too much frigging shit happened otherwise.", "I\u2019ve done this, it wasn\u2019t accepted as evidence. But also recording someone without their consent can\u2019t be used as evidence either, even it it show\u2019s obvious abuse. Crazy system!", "While it is shit that she messaged him on a platform She knows he blocks her on, it sounds like there honestly wasn't a much more viable option. Plus she isn't legally obligated to do so. Ex sounds like he's gone off the deep end. Definitely abusive. NTA", "Literacy", "It is a breech, but he always brings her back before court so the court are never interested. He never puts it in a text or anything, he just doesn\u2019t show up. And if I go to his house he isn\u2019t there or just doesn\u2019t answer the door. Police have been called before, but they don\u2019t get involved because it\u2019s a domestic thing.", "What amuses me is OP could take the daughter to Scotland and something could happen to them, he still wouldnt know where to find them.", "she didn't though, she said very clearly that she can tell her daughters father whatever, and she let her ex know that they were on vaction learn to read", "Way to blame one of the victims. OP is not responsible for the behavior of her asshole ex.", "Yes, straight from his to the ferry. \n\nI\u2019m blocked on every platform so I can\u2019t text him. I could from my daughters phone, but that seemed unfair too.", "Then you're getting into parental alienation territory.", ">I told her she can tell him whatever she likes (it\u2019s up to her if she tells him we\u2019re on holiday) but I did warn her that he probably doesn\u2019t know and might be unhappy.\n\nThat's not what happened. OP Just let her daughter decide for herself.", "You can use visual recordings without consent, you only need consent for audio. I don't know why. So you could have your phone in your pocket or on a shelf nearby and record an exchange if anything happens in person. Or refuse calls and only agree to video calls which you can record ongoing.", "This is something your solicitor should be able to advise you on - there has to be some way to submit evidence. You have my empathy; what a horrible situation", "That\u2019s disappointing. I live in a one party state so recording someone if you are involved in the conversation is ok. \n\nI would ask the lawyer / solicitor what options you have to prove his abusive behavior. Maybe you will need a witness around for any communication between you guys that can testify to a judge how he is acting. \n\nI have heard people talk about a certain texting app which all communication is accessible to the court, and is used for coparenting in these situations. Maybe there\u2019s something like that which can be used? \n\n(ETA:) Also consider anytime you talk to just state upfront that you will be recording the conversation and then do so. At worst he will have to be on his best behavior when you talk.", "I would say it's implied he blocks her on a lot of things and that she uses Whatsapp frequently otherwise she'd say blocked her number", "Where did the OP day her husband was illiterate?", "It\u2019s exactly this. Although it gets violated a lot, but the courts don\u2019t really care.", "Are you not able to argue that pattern? Not familiar with UK family law but judges in the US with experience are pretty savvy to those kinds of tricks. Maybe at least argue that he should have to pay the fee of 300 because of the repeated failures to return until you file in court.", "This doesn't make sense. You said he only sees her two weekends a month. Did you leave for this trip directly from getting her from him? Could you not have shared the travel information once you arrived in France?\n\nDon't get me wrong, it sounds like your ex totally sucks, but it really feels like you wanted to stir the pot. You keep blaming the courts, but YOU aren't actually doing anything to protect your daughter.", "If he does that, instead of wasting 300, get proof that it is your time and call the cops for abduction.", "EXACTLY", "You've literally never spoken to him other than in person? No arranging meetings at all? Absolutely 0 way to call in case of emergency?\n\n\nI feel like this, and the refusal to return her, all needs to be reported through legal channels. \n\n\n\nWas this a surprise trip for your daughter? She was with him all weekend and never mentioned that she was going on a trip?", "Yes, knowing that if her daughter told her, her daughter would be screamed at. She should not have put her daughter in that position.", "I\u2019ve tried, the court weren\u2019t particularly interested. He has done it about 5 times since I last made an application to vary, so maybe now I\u2019ll stand more of a chance. The legal system is very expensive in the UK, it\u2019s very slow too.", "We left straight from his place. The only way I could have told him once we arrived is with my daughters phone.", "It was a surprise yes. \n\nNo I have absolutely no way to contact him with a phone, unless I use my daughters phone, but I think that\u2019s not really right. \n\nI have reported him not returning her every single time he\u2019s done it, but because he returns her before we get to court nothing happens. It\u2019s a terrible system.", "If they went missing. He'd contact police. They'd track the passport. Border control in France would have an idea where they were staying. Police could check the financial record and mobile phone data. Unless they intentionally go on the run, people are very easy to find.", "How do you communicate about regular pick-up/drop-offs?", "You legit could have called him after you picked her up and informed him. Or you could have scheduled your holiday to leave 1 day after you picked her up. You\u2019re the one in charge of scheduling your own holiday, so acting like there just wasn\u2019t any time because you left directly from his house is ridiculous. You\u2019re the one who set it up that way.", "I think ESH. The way you describe your husband he sounds controlling and manipulative, and you have every right to take your daughter on vacation. However, you should not have put your daughter in the position of being the one to tell him first. It sounds like both of you often put her in the middle of your fighting, and she doesn't deserve that.", "Maybe you aren't an AH. But I still have serious questions about the messaging him on Whatsapp, knowing he won't see it. That is worse. It seems like you want a paper trail to fake it.", "We don\u2019t. They\u2019re at pre-scheduled times that never change.", "Called him from my daughters phone? \n\nI guess I could of, but I don\u2019t think that would have changed much. There are reasons why we had to leave on that day: work, other summer plans, money etc\u2026", "But when dad keeps her for longer and doesn't return her on mom's scheduled times, just to be a dick, how should she react? Life isn't reddit and people hardly ever do the right thing. If he knew that they were going he would've ruined the trip. Sometimes you gotta ask for forgiveness and not permission.", "He\u2019s an abusive manipulator. She is not being dramatic you insensitive toad", "Blah blah blah lol. She\u2019s absolutely the AH regardless."]}
