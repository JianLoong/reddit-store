She missed no time off school and it didn\u2019t effect her contact with her dad. We have a child arrangements order and legally I\u2019m allowed to take my daughter anywhere without permission or notice as long as it doesn\u2019t effect contact. (I checked with a solicitor) \n\nWhen I booked the holiday I sent a WhatsApp message to my daughters dad to tell him I was taking her on holiday. I gave the dates, the location and travel details. There is a big but, I know he has me blocked on WhatsApp so I knew he\u2019d never see the message. \n\nI knew if he knew he\u2019d kick off and try and ruin our holiday. I know I\u2019m not legally obligated to tell him about our holiday, but I thought it would help the situation if I could say, well I did send him the details. \n\nAnyway we get to France and we\u2019re having a great time. My daughter decided to call her dad for a chat. I told her she can tell him whatever she likes (it\u2019s up to her if she tells him we\u2019re on holiday) but I did warn her that he probably doesn\u2019t know and might be unhappy. \n\nPart way through the call she mentions we\u2019re in France and he goes ballistic. Screaming, shouting etc.. he demanded to speak to me. I got on the phone, but couldn\u2019t get a word in for all the screaming so I ended the call. \n\nHe starts blowing up mine & my daughters phone demanding we return to the UK immediately. He was threatening to have me arrested for abduction etc\u2026\n\nI calmly sent him a message stating we are on holiday, we\u2019ll be home before he is due to see daughter and that daughter is happy, healthy and enjoying a holiday. I told him that he\u2019s welcome to call and text her but please not stop screaming & shouting as it\u2019s distressing her. \n\nHe text back calling me an AH and saying he\u2019ll see me in court. \n\nAITA?\n\nETA - Whenever my ex doesn\u2019t like something he keeps our daughter and refuses to return her. I\u2019m then forced to apply to the court (That costs \u00a3300 fyi) then just before court or once we\u2019ve missed whatever he intended to ruin he brings her back. The court the say there is no issue and life resumes.  It\u2019s a terrible system, but it\u2019s what we have so I deal with it.\n\nHe has pretty minimal contact as it is (2 weekends a month) I have a non molestation order against him, but we can communicate about our daughter and obviously I have to see him at handovers. He has me blocked on every platform, but he unblocks me whenever he wants, then blocks again. (My daughter has her own phone that she called him from) \n\nI understand nothing about this situation is ideal, my daughter has begged me for 2 years to go to Disneyland and I so badly wanted to make this dream possible for her. I\u2019m pretty sick of living a life where so much is controlled by my ex, this is the first time I\u2019ve really gone against him and decided to just do what I wanted.", "created_utc": 1689344840, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14zhwfb/aita_for_taking_my_daughter_out_of_the_country/", "score": 3045, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s clear you\u2019re the main carer of your child and he sees her two weekends a month. He\u2019s the one who blocked you from messaging him. It didn\u2019t impact his time with her. You know him better than we ever will and so you\u2019ll be best placed to know how he\u2019ll react and what he would do if he didn\u2019t get his way. He\u2019s an angry child who will stamp his feet and cause problems. You\u2019ve already said there have been times when he\u2019s refused to bring her back as agreed. In a previous post you\u2019ve also said he\u2019s befriended a man who raped you, after knowing he\u2019d raped you! \n\nSorry to say but he\u2019s brought this on himself by not parenting properly at all and trying to control everything. \n\nI\u2019m in the UK myself and I know popping to France is neither here nor there. You\u2019ve acted within the law, sought advice before you\u2019ve gone and messaged him directly to say you were going. He would\u2019ve absolutely ruined it and it\u2019s his own fault for blocking the mother of his child from messaging him. \n\nGiven all this context you\u2019re NTA but you did chuck your daughter under the bus a bit. Having said that, he shouldn\u2019t be shouting at anyone here. His behaviour sucks and if he\u2019d not acted this way, he\u2019d have been very aware that you\u2019d gone. Also, why the hell wouldn\u2019t you want your child to have a nice holiday?", "ALSO DEPENDS WHAT PART OF WARZONE FRANE", "*ETA: Because of a lot more clarifications in the replies and comments, especially the admission of a mistake for her daughter's role in this, I am switching it to NTA because it's a very clear abusive situation that OP is currently stuck in. Which is what I suspected, but definitely didn't know HOW bad until further comments. I will keep my original comments up, regardless, but do not feel that way anymore with more information given in the last couple of hours.\n\n~~E S H~~ - So, after reading the post and replies, assuming this is all correct, I think both of you suck because of how it's affecting your daughter. Him for his anger, his abuse and skirting the legality around the custody agreement by keeping her longer to get his way unless the courts are called. He sounds terrible and abusive, especially if you have a non-molestation order on him (like, what?)\n\nBut you ALSO suck. I don't know whether you are so traumatized by his abuse that it's affected your ability to parent, but from all of this, it seems like you...really don't care about your daughter much at all and are more concerned with how this affects you. You seem so numb to the abuse your daughter is sustaining from your ex (the yelling, the kidnapping, and who knows what he's doing when he has her). You allow HER to experience his rage and have to tell him about the trip. You think him having so much custody time even after kidnapping and his anger issues is totally fine. You are more concerned with having to confront him than having your daughter confront him. You're also fine with the possibility of him taking her out of country and not knowing where.\n\nIt's all just....very, very sad and scary. If this is all true and you were affected by his abuse, you need help because as much as you downplay your daughter's feelings in all of this, it only makes logical sense that she's affected by both of your actions way worse than you know. His anger and your lack of protection and acceptance of all of this is affecting her long-term.\n\nI just feel so bad for this little girl, who legally has eight more years of this bullshit to deal with.", "YTA, you\u2019re playing games and using your kid as a pawn. You sent him a message to say you did knowing that he would not get it. You\u2019d be just as pissed if he took her out of the country without your knowledge. Poor kid.", "NTA In the US you could still be in the same state with the short distance you traveled. Going from country to country isn't a big deal in Europe and your ex completely overreacted. You should look forward to your opportunity to demonstrate to the court that he verbally abused you and your daughter over actions that were well within your custody agreement.", "YTA you deliberately told him in a way you knew he wouldn't see which is shady.\n\nYou then put your own daughter in the firing line. Telling a 10 year old \"well you can tell him if you want but it might make him unhappy\" is a really shitty thing to do. It doesn't stop her from having to deal with the fallout but it makes her feel like it's her fault he's angry rather than yours. You're basically giving her the choice of lying to her dad or making him angry\n\nYou claim that it was the only way you'd get the holiday but you're also claim you have the legal right to take her so what exactly are you claiming he would do to stop you?\n\nYour paragraph shows you being manipulative towards your ex and towards your own child so forgive me if I don't exactly trust that you're not also trying to manipulate us as well", "As long as your solicitor said it was okay, you're good imo. Enjoy your trip! NTA", "YTA. \n\nThis is one of those situations where you may \"legally\" be entitled to do what you did, but its a shitty co-parenting thing to do.  The fact that you purposely sent a message in a way where you knew you wouldn't be seen as a way to have plausible deniability is really what puts this over the top for me. \n\nYour daughter and her dad seem to have a decent relationship that you want to interfere in. That is shitty", "YTA shocking coparenting on your part. And worse you made your daughter tell him??! Couldn\u2019t have the adult conversation yourself. Jeez.", "Your behaviour is... YTA.\n\nYou're using your daughter as a pawn to keep pissing off your ex, it seems. You knew she'd mention France. You knew he'd be pissed. You knew this would blow up and chose not to deal with it as an adult, but by sending a plausible deniability whatsapp message so you'd have an excuse.\n\nWhat the everlasting f? (ETA: Go to France, by all means - but own your shit before you go.)", "Y\u2019all are missing the part where there are abusive undertones. Op stated that dad would sabotage if he knew beforehand and not return their daughter.\n\nEdit: my vote is NTA btw:)", "Edit: NTA. He has a pattern of not returning your daughter in retaliation if things don\u2019t go his way and you have the equivalent of a restraining order against him for his behaviour towards you. You are primary parent and he has her only 2 weekends a month. In an ideal world, you would have told him and he would have co-operated, but when you\u2019re dealing with people who have a history of abuse and particularly in abusing the system in their favour, ideal goes out the window and you do what you need to do to live your life without continuing to be victimised. \n\nJust to appease all those outraged here:\n\nI N F O: could you describe more about your co-parenting relationship with the father? You have said he would have refused to return her to ruin the holiday and that he became verbally abusive when he found out, which seems like a pattern of behaviour as you warned your daughter about it. Is this behaviour indicative of why the relationship broke down and how he generally engages in co-parenting?", "You are legally allowed to take her? He sounds abusive and unhinged. NTA", "NTAH From what I understand leaving the country is much more normalized in Europe, which makes sense why you had legal rights to take her without his permission. If you knew he would react unfairly and you don't have to tell him, you shouldn't give him the power to start the fight. Your daughter seemed fine with it and I think she is old enough to decide if she wants to go on Holiday.", "This would be illegal in other countries.  Not sure what the UK has to say about it.   Even if you aren't \"abducting\" her, it's in the best interest of your child for her other legal guardian knows where she is in case of emergencies.\n\nSo yeah, YTA.", "ESH.

You sound like such a shitty person. I hope your daughter grows up knowing not to be like either of you. You should have told him ahead of time, in a form that you knew he would receive, not one that you knew he would not receive. You should have had the conversation with him and then when he blew up about it, you could have simply told him that if this was how we was going to be about it then you were going to block his number for the week so that he is not ruining things and then just unblock his number when the vacation is done. But you chose to be just as shitty about things as he did.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit to add. \n\nYou came on here asking if you are the AH or not and the verdict seems to be tha you are the AH so why come on here to ask that just to keep arguing that you are right and he is wrong?", "NTA you have primary custody so can do as you see fit, if he takes it to court make sure to bring screenshots and a witness testimony of the abuse he\u2019s given, so he can lose even more access", "NTA To me, the ah is always going to be the person who blocks the person they co-parent with. Hope you enjoy your vacation", "NTA. Try to record his outbursts of verbal abuse so you have more evidence of his poor anger management and controlling tendencies.

And why even bother sending something you know he isnt going to get unless its just to make it look like you tried to the courts? Your daughter deserves to have you both in her life & have you working together for her best interests.", "You should add a vote as it looks like this is the top message.\n\nAnd I agree it seems like he's so controlling it's abusive.", "Yep, I was ready to y t a because my dad tried to sneak my sister and I out of the country when we were kids (no idea what his plans were after that, if he actually planned to kidnap us or what) but my Mom rushed to court and managed to get control of our passports. But it does seem like he\u2019s the abusive one and OP is just trying to give her daughter a good life", "I think maybe OP should have told the dad after they got there, to avoid what happened to the daughter. But then again, he probably would have still called up his daughter and screamed at her.", "Something she added after the fact, which makes it suspect.", "Thank you.", "No they don\u2019t. I have an order stating I can take daughter out of UK for up to 28 days without permission or notice.", "> Before you down vote me - please read what I have put and check the link\n\nOK. I read it all, then I downvoted you.\n\nFrom your link:\n\n> You can take a child abroad for 28 days without getting permission if a child arrangement order says the child must live with you, unless a court order says you can\u2019t.\n\nThere was a massive, flashing red light right there saying there's possibly a very good reason the professional advising her knew better than you, but you chose to try to scare her, anyway.\n\nStop it.", "We legally can\u2019t sit down and talk. I have a non molestation order. He refuses mediation so all we\u2019re left with is the courts.", "She should have been the one to tell him (not pretend tell him via an app he blocked her on) that they were in France. That's a lot to lay on a kid. Otherwise NTA.", "As the resident parent, in the UK you do not need the non resident parent permission for therapy. The non resident parent also can't pull the child out of therapy.", "Oy, I'm really sorry to hear that. Would anything change if your daughter didn't want to go to him?", "Him denying her counseling is a special level of abusive.", "I\u2019m so sorry to hear that. It\u2019s disgusting that with this clear pattern of dysfunction that the courts won\u2019t even consider taking a look at the patterns that are right in front of their eyes. \n\nAbusers (I call him that because his behavior towards you is abusive and irresponsible, *and* he\u2019s abusing his power as a parent by violating your shared custody agreement whenever he wants and involving your daughter in his temper tantrums) will always try to manipulate you into feeling like shit for subverting their abuse. I wish I had some helpful advice to offer you but I\u2019m out of my range on this one. You\u2019re doing the right thing and I wish you and your daughter the best of luck.", "NTA, sounds like dad is a 2 year old stomping his feet because he didn't get what he wanted.", "Oh ive not heard of that before (non molestation order). That would be absolutely devastating & difficult. Esp for your daughter", "Yeah, I\u2019ve had a few friends and relatives dealing with this. Hell, even if someone is being abusive to the kids they don\u2019t always lose custody. What a broken ass system we have.", "This. UK to france is the equivalent of Seattle to San Francisco or San Francisco to Salt Lake City. We're not even talking LA to Miami here - just east coast or west coast travel alone... \n\nOP, definitely NTA.", "If you live anywhere near the north or south border you do lol. I was always 20 mins from Canada growing up", "I live in The Netherlands. If I get in my car *really* early, I can drive from the top of my country all the way to the bottom in one day with rest stops where needed. The UK, Belgium and France are practically around the corner. \n\nGetting to travel across Europe isn\u2019t as big a deal as some Americans seem to make out of it, since compared to the US. Europe really isn\u2019t that big.", "Ofc they never get out of US, huh.  I went to Paris once and I found out there was super subway to London. I was like cool.  I went to London for two days with low budget. Best ever.\n\nOh next time I try to ride to Amsterdam via Paris.  Lol", "Agreed - I visited various cities in Syria in 2010 and it was wonderful. So awful what its people have had to endure since then.", "My daughter\u2019s therapist refused to continue seeing her unless the court said okay after my ex told her she couldn\u2019t keep providing therapy to our daughter. My solicitor said it\u2019ll be very difficult to keep her in therapy with him doing that so best to get a specific issue order.", "Once she\u2019s 12 years old yes, before that no.", "Yeah her abusive father who kidnaps her and keeps her out of therapy I\u2019m sure it\u2019s her ruining there relationship lol", "It\u2019s the UK equivalent of a restraining order.", "It's waaaay closer. I'm from Atlanta. London to Paris is like 2.5 hours. Atlanta to Orlando is 6 hours. Also you have to drive those 6 hours, but in Europe you can take a train.", "I went to Poland and Berlin with mine, both for history class.", "She did deliberately use a method to contact him that she knew wouldn\u2019t work, though.", "We have a terrible rail system, and very few understand how travel works in EU member states. Plus our distances are pretty vast between states, particularly as you move farther west.", "I did a semester abroad in the UK in college.  We went to Paris for a weekend.  I got to meet an internet friend from Ye Olde Small Messageboards who lived in the Netherlands.  He came to Paris and we hung out for a day!\n\nMy retirement plan used to be to move to Scotland for two years and use it as my base to travel the rest of the Europe.", "Might be better that he finds out while she can hand the phone to her mum (and has time to cool off) than that he finds out over pancakes next week.", "So let the daughter get screamed at in person? I guess I'm struggling to see how op had any other better options.\n\nI think we are trying to say the same thing, it sucks because dad wants to be a dick. \n\nAlso, I'm projecting hugely here, my stepdad who was abusive (verbally, physically and sexually) told me, verbatim \"don't tell your mom, she'll be mad\". And I get very afraid when that line of reasoning comes up. \n\nI know slippery slope is not logical, but ugh, it gets my blood pressure up. Getting kids to cover for parental behaviour just bothers me.", "But she has informed him of the recording, which is what you need in the UK.  She can hold a broken handset for all he knows, all he has to think is that the phone was the recording device she was alluding to not the clip on camera hidden on her person.  Then when he breaks the (already useless phone) she can continue recording.", "London to Paris, by car, is 6-7 hours", "I only recently realised calling Americans yanks was offensive. We always used that term in Ireland. I genuinely had no idea", "As an Australian we call all of you Yanks. We\u2019re aware of the civil war thing. The south lost.", "You realize some regions of the US have smaller states though right? Driving through New England and seeing five states and driving through the PNW and seeing five states are not the same.", "You are legally allowed to take her? He sounds abusive and unhinged. NTA", "Oh, man.  Usually it is used as a joke, or a gentle tease.", "The Slavers' Revolt", "What, was OP supposed to be like \u201cdon\u2019t talk to your father, don\u2019t tell him we\u2019re here\u201d and then maybe when they get back daughter lets it slip about the trip and dad yells anyway?", "Nice burn.", "She should've been the one to tell him. She needs to protect her daughter, not put her daughter in the firing line and hiding behind \"it was her choice\"."]}
