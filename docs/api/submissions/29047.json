There is a reason \"I wouldn't kick him out of bed for eating crackers\" means you'd make  an exception for someone.  Sleeping in crumbs sucks!", "NTA and so many red flags!!

You share a child with a child.", "NTA.\n\nJust because he did it for you once without you asking, doesn't mean you can read his mind.\n\nYes, he was hoping that you would notice he didn't come to breakfast and decide to bring it to him.  You were busy with your child. \n\nSorry you have two children to deal with.", "NTA\n\nHe isn't paying to stay in an expensive hotel where they have room service.  \n\nIf he wants breakfast in bed and its a special occasion like his birthday then he can ask if you are willing to make it for him as a treat.  If its not and he hasn't asked then why on earth would he think he can act like such an entitled prick?", "NTA and red flags", "NTA. \n\nHow on earth should OP have known without him communicating? Nobody can read minds..\n\nBesides that  I think breakfast in bed is something that somebody offers to do, not demands to get. With exceptions like sickness which makes somebody bedridden.", "Growing up, breakfast in bed only happened on birthdays & Mother's Day. Even if you were sick, you had to drag you sorry bum to the kitchen (or dining room) to eat. You might get a cup of soup if you were super sick (but the den was still preferred), but nothing that could leave crumbs was allowed in the bedrooms as a rule.\n\nAs you have a young child, that's even more reason to set down and enforce such rules.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nDoes stuff like this happen a lot?\n\nVery bizarre and concerning.", "NTA.\n\nYou're not a mind reader or a servant. At the very least, he could have gotten breakfast himself and taken it back to bed with him if he wanted to stain the sheets that badly.", "Nta he can get off his grown ass and get his food.", "NTA. You're dealing with 2 toddlers.", "He did ask me to bring him the breakfast in bed and I said no. I\u2019ve brought him breakfast wherever he is in the house before in the past and this one time I said no, he had a freaking cow over it and left for about 2 hours", "NTA, but with a clause included. Your husband has probably been waiting a long time for you to return the nice gesture he did for you, and that was your chance to do so. He's obviously frustrated that he does it for you and when you were given the chance to do the same you didn't care enough to do so. You're NTA now because you didn't realise it was important to him that he be shown a spontaneous act of kindness as well, but if you don't make it up to him then you will be.", "Yta.
