Sounds like she had brought him coffee in bed already that morning. Then their child woke up and needed an adult to take care of them. She then cooked for everyone and fed the child and herself all while the child's father pouted in bed. I'm sorry, but he can get up and eat at the table. Sounds like she has 2 children.

Her fiance can get up off his ass and go to the kitchen and eat breakfast with his child and soon to be wife.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Cheating is an easy example to explain this, because whether we like it or not, it happens - and it's very common for the cheating partner to act out like that. \n\nIt could be them building up resentment for a million different reasons. But I doubt someone would lose their shit over not getting breakfast in bed.", "This is an amazing movie! He does have 4 boys though... I was so stoked to watch the 2nd one, but it was no where near as good.
