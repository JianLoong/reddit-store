We\u2019re planning on traveling & staying with my parents a week before the wedding so we can finish up the last few details & not be super stressed about it. Given that we\u2019ll be there for awhile, we\u2019ve decided to bring our dog with us rather than boarding him. He\u2019s a good dog, but he\u2019s very timid around strangers (especially men)/in new areas. A few months ago, I reached out to my ex, Kait, (weird, I know. We dated when we were teens, there\u2019s no bad blood, my fianc\u00e9e is fine with it) to see if she could watch my dog & my parents two dogs the night of our wedding since she was one of the only people I could think of that I trust & wasn\u2019t invited to the wedding. She agreed.\r  \nYesterday My mom & I were discussing various wedding related things when she slipped in that my step sister, her husband, & their two kids (7M & 5F) are planning on coming. I was shocked because while I did invite them, I didn\u2019t expect them to come. They live about 14 hours away & they don\u2019t have a lot of money, so I didn\u2019t think they would be able to afford to come. I\u2019m fine with them coming, but I reminded my mom that our wedding is child free. Although I didn\u2019t expect them to come, I made the child free rule specifically because of my niece & nephew, just in case this situation were to arise. I love them, but they are not parented. They have horrible behavioral issues. She said \u201cI know. I figured Kait could just watch the kids since she\u2019s coming to the house anyway.\u201d We got into an argument about it because I said I didn\u2019t think Kait would agree to watching 2 hellions & 3 dogs. My mom said there\u2019s no other option for them as they don\u2019t know anyone in the area & would need to rely on someone we know to watch the kids at the house. I told her I wasn\u2019t asking Kait as she\u2019s already doing me a huge favor & my sister would either need to find her own childcare or leave them home with her MIL or SIL that live literally right next to them.\r  \nOn top of this, my fianc\u00e9e & I are now planning to stay with my MOH rather than my parents the week of the wedding because their house is a 3BR 2BA, with one of the bathrooms being IN the master bedroom. Seeing as how my sister & her family would also be staying with my parents due to money, I would rather not be in a small house with 8 people. We\u2019re also planning for our dog to stay at a family friends house. Although this person is invited to the wedding, my dog is fine to stay by himself for 8 hours & she has a fenced in backyard so he would not have to be walked. This now excludes Kait from the equation, leaving my sister with no childcare. I was told I\u2019m selfish for not being considerate of their financial situation. I really don\u2019t feel bad.

For all you know step-sis thinks the kids are coming to the wedding and will just bring if there\u2019s no childcare. Or, For all you know she and the hubby would love to have a child free vacay and would happily leave the kids with the in laws but we\u2019re bringing the kids because they thought the kids were wanted at a family wedding (a lot of people erroneously interpret a kid free wedding as \u201ckid free unless you are family\u201d)", "I think everyone involved in this situation absolutely understands my stance on the wedding being child free and I truly don't believe there was any intention on bringing them. I think my mom just assumed that whoever watched the dogs would also watch the kids. My parents have a family friend who watches their dogs when they go out of town or whatever. Their dogs are seniors and don't require much other than food and the occasional pets. He's a nice guy but he has some health issues, and he's a guy. As I said in my post, my dog is super timid around men, especially men he doesn't know well. I think the only man he's fine with is my step-dad. My dog is also only 2 and still requires play time, walks, and attention. Therefore I didn't feel confident in the family friend watching specifically my dog. That's why I asked Kait to watch the dogs. Keep in mind, I got the approval from my mom to ask Kait. So now I'm wondering that, say we were boarding our dog and not traveling with him. Was my mom going to assume that this family friend that doesn't get around well was going to watch these kids?? There's no way he was gonna be okay with it. I just find the whole thing bizarre because my mom typically doesn't think like this. But you're correct. It's up to them to figure it out now", "Kids with known behavioural issues at that, when the family isn't the most well off. That's looking like a road trip, and not a fun one.", "It's late Spring, so it's a little further off than what you're thinking. They haven't RSVPd yet. But given the way the conversation went with my mom yesterday, I believe they are like 90% sure they're coming. Especially if they're (not really) trying to figure out what to do with their kids.", "They were well aware the wedding is child free. It's posted on our FAQ's on our website. It was put on the info card on the invite. And they acknowledged they knew it was childfree. The wedding itself is not the issue here. They never had any intention of bringing the kids to the wedding. It's that they are planning on traveling, bringing their kids, and just expecting someone that they don't know to watch them, for free.", "Kind of wished I would have now. I was just trying to be nice lol.", "im learning sometimes its just easier to be the bad guy from the start.", "Disagree. According to OP, child free was indicated all over the invite. This is on the sister and mom for assuming childcare would be a available and free.", "No I haven\u2019t asked Kait, and I won\u2019t. I\u2019m paying her for watching the dogs, of course. There are a million ways THEY could find childcare for themselves. This is my stepdads daughter. He is originally from the state my step sister currently lives in. Thus, ALL of their family (that I have no connection to) lives there as well. Her mom, her in laws, her husbands siblings, all of her close friends, etc. There\u2019s absolutely no reason they can\u2019t leave them with any of the 30+ people that live near her. Instead, she wants to bring them along to an area where she knows nobody, and dump them with someone that they don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not a parent, but I wouldn\u2019t leave my kid with someone I didn\u2019t know. \n\nAnother reason I won\u2019t be asking Kait is because I wouldn\u2019t ask anyone to watch these kids. They aren\u2019t made to mind, they have no manners, they have serious behavioral issues because they aren\u2019t parented. At all. I wouldn\u2019t put that on ANYONE. I understand that people might not come due to the wedding being child free. I am 100% okay with that.

Our dog sitter where we live charges $55 a day so I was gonna give Kait $150 for the 3 dogs. I felt that was fair. I have no idea what babysitting rates are but I would assume way more than $150 and I\u2019m not paying for it.", "Have someone on standby in case they show up to the wedding with their kids.", "NTA. They DO have another option. They don\u2019t have to attend. Attending weddings is not a right and they certainly don\u2019t have the right to make issues for others to do so. I\u2019d give Kait a warning that your mom might be trying to rope her into babysitting so she can avoid her.", "I doesn't even need to be said but I'm saying it anyway, watching kids and watching pets do not require the same amount of work. I would happily take a stranger's pet for a few hours but would only accept children in my care if a very good trusted friend was out of options. I certainly would not want to watch kids I've never met before.", "Let\u2019s hope that your stepsister on the day of the wedding doesn\u2019t pull a \u201c sorry we brought the kids because we couldn\u2019t find a babysitter \u201c move and shows up with the kids. Make sure you cover all the possible scenarios", "NTA. I had a child free/destination wedding. If your stepsister has all her family in her home state she has plenty of child care options. It sounds to me that she probably asked but most likely as you said, her immediate family doesn\u2019t want nor be responsible for babysitting because of all behavioral issues.  You need to be firmed and tell het that no children will be allowed at the wedding, no excuses. Your day, your rules", "Yep, assign a bouncer", "If I was the dog sitter, and showed up to watch three dogs and was presented with three dogs and two unruly children, I would turn around and walk right out the door. I like kids. I've babysat quite a bit in the past. But watching dogs vs watching kids is a whole different level of work and responsibility.", "This upcoming year. Spring of 2024. There\u2019s still over 6 months until the wedding. I\u2019ve never quite understood people that don\u2019t go to a wedding that\u2019s child free just because it\u2019s child free because unless they weren\u2019t given an adequate amount of time or the child has a condition or something where they can\u2019t be away, there\u2019s no reason people can\u2019t look for childcare.", "\"Oh, we understand...Family Restaurant X is just down the road, we appreciate that you thought of us on our big day, hope you have a good trip home!\"", "She invited the PARENTS, not the kids as wedding is child free.", "Yep nailed it. I would do the Same, dogs and Kids are Not really compatibel (If their Not your own)", "\"I'm not touching you. I'm not touching you.\" all while her finger is barely an inch away.", "I recall the sort of backseat squabbles in my youth with my sister that were in this vein.  Driving my dad to use the \"if you don't stop this, I swear I will stop this car and make you walk home.\"\n\nCliches exist because they do in real life, folks", "I\u2019m gonna be honest, we don\u2019t have a relationship. This is my stepdads daughter. My mom and stepdad got married about 10 years ago and in those 10 years, we\u2019ve seen each other in person a maximum of 5 times due to her living so far away. I invited them because they are still family. I don\u2019t feel I\u2019m in the wrong for assuming they wouldn\u2019t come considering we don\u2019t even talk. I am happy for them to come, but I have no obligation to help them with their kids.", "My brother is 1 year older than me and at 12/13 yo did this to me the whole drive from western Pa to Eastern VA. 10 hours of \"I'm not touching you, just ignore me, I'm not touching you, just ignore.  My awesome dad finally hit a bump on purpose, causing my brother to touch me. Then did nothing when i finally punched him."]}
