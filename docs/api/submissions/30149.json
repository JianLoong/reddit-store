We\u2019re planning on traveling & staying with my parents a week before the wedding so we can finish up the last few details & not be super stressed about it. Given that we\u2019ll be there for awhile, we\u2019ve decided to bring our dog with us rather than boarding him. He\u2019s a good dog, but he\u2019s very timid around strangers (especially men)/in new areas. A few months ago, I reached out to my ex, Kait, (weird, I know. We dated when we were teens, there\u2019s no bad blood, my fianc\u00e9e is fine with it) to see if she could watch my dog & my parents two dogs the night of our wedding since she was one of the only people I could think of that I trust & wasn\u2019t invited to the wedding. She agreed.\r  \nYesterday My mom & I were discussing various wedding related things when she slipped in that my step sister, her husband, & their two kids (7M & 5F) are planning on coming. I was shocked because while I did invite them, I didn\u2019t expect them to come. They live about 14 hours away & they don\u2019t have a lot of money, so I didn\u2019t think they would be able to afford to come. I\u2019m fine with them coming, but I reminded my mom that our wedding is child free. Although I didn\u2019t expect them to come, I made the child free rule specifically because of my niece & nephew, just in case this situation were to arise. I love them, but they are not parented. They have horrible behavioral issues. She said \u201cI know. I figured Kait could just watch the kids since she\u2019s coming to the house anyway.\u201d We got into an argument about it because I said I didn\u2019t think Kait would agree to watching 2 hellions & 3 dogs. My mom said there\u2019s no other option for them as they don\u2019t know anyone in the area & would need to rely on someone we know to watch the kids at the house. I told her I wasn\u2019t asking Kait as she\u2019s already doing me a huge favor & my sister would either need to find her own childcare or leave them home with her MIL or SIL that live literally right next to them.\r  \nOn top of this, my fianc\u00e9e & I are now planning to stay with my MOH rather than my parents the week of the wedding because their house is a 3BR 2BA, with one of the bathrooms being IN the master bedroom. Seeing as how my sister & her family would also be staying with my parents due to money, I would rather not be in a small house with 8 people. We\u2019re also planning for our dog to stay at a family friends house. Although this person is invited to the wedding, my dog is fine to stay by himself for 8 hours & she has a fenced in backyard so he would not have to be walked. This now excludes Kait from the equation, leaving my sister with no childcare. I was told I\u2019m selfish for not being considerate of their financial situation. I really don\u2019t feel bad. It\u2019s not my responsibility to find childcare for kids that aren\u2019t mine.

She is the one that seems to be pushing for this. NTA btw.", "NTA", "NTA \u2026 ish. \n\nI wonder if your mom has communicated any of this to step-sis, you certainly haven\u2019t. You should. For all you know step-sis thinks the kids are coming to the wedding and will just bring if there\u2019s no childcare. Or, For all you know she and the hubby would love to have a child free vacay and would happily leave the kids with the in laws but we\u2019re bringing the kids because they thought the kids were wanted at a family wedding (a lot of people erroneously interpret a kid free wedding as \u201ckid free unless you are family\u201d)", "I think everyone involved in this situation absolutely understands my stance on the wedding being child free and I truly don't believe there was any intention on bringing them. I think my mom just assumed that whoever watched the dogs would also watch the kids. My parents have a family friend who watches their dogs when they go out of town or whatever. Their dogs are seniors and don't require much other than food and the occasional pets. He's a nice guy but he has some health issues, and he's a guy. As I said in my post, my dog is super timid around men, especially men he doesn't know well. I think the only man he's fine with is my step-dad. My dog is also only 2 and still requires play time, walks, and attention. Therefore I didn't feel confident in the family friend watching specifically my dog. That's why I asked Kait to watch the dogs. Keep in mind, I got the approval from my mom to ask Kait. So now I'm wondering that, say we were boarding our dog and not traveling with him. Was my mom going to assume that this family friend that doesn't get around well was going to watch these kids?? There's no way he was gonna be okay with it. I just find the whole thing bizarre because my mom typically doesn't think like this. But you're correct. It's up to them to figure it out now", "Kids with known behavioural issues at that, when the family isn't the most well off. That's looking like a road trip, and not a fun one.", "It's late Spring, so it's a little further off than what you're thinking. They haven't RSVPd yet. But given the way the conversation went with my mom yesterday, I believe they are like 90% sure they're coming. Especially if they're (not really) trying to figure out what to do with their kids.", "They were well aware the wedding is child free. It's posted on our FAQ's on our website. It was put on the info card on the invite. And they acknowledged they knew it was childfree. The wedding itself is not the issue here. They never had any intention of bringing the kids to the wedding. It's that they are planning on traveling, bringing their kids, and just expecting someone that they don't know to watch them, for free.", "Kind of wished I would have now. I was just trying to be nice lol.", "im learning sometimes its just easier to be the bad guy from the start.", "Disagree. According to OP, child free was indicated all over the invite. This is on the sister and mom for assuming childcare would be a available and free.", "No I haven\u2019t asked Kait, and I won\u2019t. I\u2019m paying her for watching the dogs, of course. There are a million ways THEY could find childcare for themselves. This is my stepdads daughter. He is originally from the state my step sister currently lives in. Thus, ALL of their family (that I have no connection to) lives there as well. Her mom, her in laws, her husbands siblings, all of her close friends, etc. There\u2019s absolutely no reason they can\u2019t leave them with any of the 30+ people that live near her. Instead, she wants to bring them along to an area where she knows nobody, and dump them with someone that they don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not a parent, but I wouldn\u2019t leave my kid with someone I didn\u2019t know. \n\nAnother reason I won\u2019t be asking Kait is because I wouldn\u2019t ask anyone to watch these kids. They aren\u2019t made to mind, they have no manners, they have serious behavioral issues because they aren\u2019t parented. At all. I wouldn\u2019t put that on ANYONE. I understand that people might not come due to the wedding being child free. I am 100% okay with that. But in no way should my fianc\u00e9e and I be even slightly responsible for helping with childcare. ESPECIALLY not for kids that don\u2019t know how to behave.", "Sorry, I was trying to keep it within the character count. MOH= Maid of honor!", "I personally would call and speak to my sister about this one on one. Mom might not be relaying information properly and it is YOUR wedding so she needs to hear YOUR boundaries from YOU. That way nothing can be pulled as far as there was a miscommunication or mom can't guilt trip you, as that is what it seems like mom is doing, to have you do what you don't want.", "Inviting someone and not expecting them to come is a sucky move. Aside from that it sounds like you're singing my song."]}
