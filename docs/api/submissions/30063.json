Best wishes to you all.", "NTA and step dad rocks! Rita learned consequence.", "NTA.  You did the right thing.  Right now she's a thief.  By getting in so much trouble she'll hopefully rethink her behavior.

She deserves it. She needs therapy too. Is she a klepto? NTA", "I'm still saying NTA.  When my mother died, she died alone in her bed in a tiny room in a shitty house - because the only child willing to take care of her HADN'T been the golden child she had given many thousands of dollars to (she literally stole my father's retirement money to buy the daughter she loved a house.)\n\nTo this day I feel deeply smug that she went out that way, because she was a vile hateful person who ruined my father's life.\n\nI see this as being the same, just smaller.  Rita ain't dead, and she's perfectly able to come back from this by being remorseful, NOT STEALING, and suffering some consequences for her actions.\n\nThink about this in a different way - what if she got busted stealing from a store in a couple years when she's 18, and went to jail?  How would theft look for college applications or job applications?", "Would you rather she get some consequences from her dad now that \"ruin\" her *social* life for a while or consequences a few years from now from someone else that involves phrases like \"5 to 10 with a possibility for parole\"? Something that might really ruin her life.\n\nAm I saying that she was guaranteed to move into actual criminal theft if she hadn't been caught? No. There's a chance that she would have matured and stopped, or kept it at the level of swiping vapes, makeup and clothes from family/roommates.\n\nBut at the same time, there is a chance that she would have progressed to stealing from businesses or strangers. Heck, even if she just kept it at stealing from family & roommates, she might still go too far.\n\nThat you are feeling the way you are, as one of her victims, is understandable. At the same time, it is good that you are bothered by the fact that you do feel this way. Such self-reflection can be an opportunity for growth as a person.\n\nOne thing that you can do that might help there... become an advocate for getting her professional help. As in therapy. Unless your step-sister is secretly a cat, there is likely some reason why she's been stealing. And it's not likely to be that she's a secret Jane's Addiction fan either. Something is likely going on in her life that you and her dad/your mom aren't aware of. Something that needs to be addressed.\n\nAdvocating to get her the help needed to deal with whatever that something is will be the next best thing you can do for her after having told her dad in the first placr.", "To paraphrase a popular saying, you are not happy at her conviction for theft.  But you're reading the verdict with some satisfaction", "She is the one who ruined her own life for the next year.

You're allowed to feel a little justice.", "From what you have said and described in comments/post I would say you are a wonderful person. Because you love her you should know that this lesson may very well save her future. Because you love her she has a chance to earn your forgiveness and get a second chance. It is normal to feel vindicated especially when something hurt you.

You're NTA, and if she gives you any shit for \"Telling\" or suchlike, remind her that she's the one who stole so much stuff from you and your mom. If she hadn't done that, she wouldn't be in this situation, and she wouldn't be so embarrassed.", "Still NTA. It generally does feel good seeing people get appropriate consequences for their actions. \n\nCurious though, did you confirm if she\u2019d been taking your debit card and putting it back before you could notice?", "At least she can make things up to OP and her mom with time, the courts aren't as forgiving.", "I think you know that you've had enough reddit for the day when you suddenly find yourself picturing a cat wearing a Jane's Addiction t-shirt sneaking around stealing things. Definitely not an image I ever thought would pop in my head until I read your comment, so thanks I guess?", "Team Step-Dad here!\n\nBecause too many parents would go into denial or feel they had to defend their kid, even when they were wrong.

Let dad's consequence be the consequence.\n\nHopefully she learns the lesson.", "NTA. I hope your step dad and mom also talk to Rita, and consider counseling.  Rita has been stealing a lot for a long time, there is something else going on.  Punishment is apppropriate, but conversation is absolutely necessary to get to the root of the problem.  And there should be a time limit to grounding-see the other post tonight. Telling a 16 in October that she will still be grounded come prom in 6 months is excessive.", "NTA.

Your stepdad is a great dude", "NTA. Rita had been getting away with it for so long that she got way too obvious.\n\nHad she also used your card?", "No, but according to the other post on here about a mom that held her daughter accountable your dad is\u2026 seriously holding your kids accountable but that other post everyone is so pissy about making a 17 year old work to pay for $4,800 in damages from one party so she missed prom. Evidently she was soooo psychologically scared from having to ~~take responsibility~~ miss prom that she hasn\u2019t been able to stop complaining about it for 10 years.", "NTA. Kudos to your step dad for being fair and teaching her actions have consequences", "NTA, you taught her she couldn't get away with theft. Better she learns this lesson from family rather then someone who would go straight to the police.", "NTA glad your step dad believed you.", "It\u2019s a pretty obvious conclusion, but since you\u2019re here, NTA", "NTA - she needs to learn a lesson, and now is the right time. This might suck for her,  but it's a hard lesson she needed to learn before she joins the adult world.", "NTA. Better Rita face the consequences of theft now in a way that won't mess up her future than when she's an adult in college and gets arrested for stealing from her roomates", "Better she figure it out now, with family, than with employees and coworkers.

If she pays attention now she can avoid a whole lot of pain and trouble in her future.", "Well done to your step-dad!!!", "There's another post right now where OP is being unilaterally voted TA for forcing her daughter to pay off a debt and grounding her from everything including prom, so I understand why she feels like TA.", "OP you got a wonderful ally and parent in a stepdad like him and do tell him what a wonderful man he is so NTA. You did nothing wrong here and please remember you are not the bad guy here for exposing stepsister's bad behaviour. It is better to nip the matter in the bud now while she is 16 rather wait when she is older. Plus she needs to learn stealing is not okay", "NTA \nI hope she learns her lesson now and turn her life around for good.", "It's clear that you care about her, so I'll give you some advice that's probably not going to be too popular. \n\nYour stepsister is at a pretty pivotal age when it comes to turning into a good person or a shitty one. She was definitely not on a great track before this, but part of why you might feel guilty about it is that this might not actually change the track she's on. Has anyone talked to her about why she did this? Can your family afford some therapy sessions for her? It's easy to be like \"well, she's a vain teenager that's why\" but there's usually something deeper. A need for attention. Deep insecurity about how she looks. Jealousy. Harassment at school. Etc. Like for example, was Halloween a big deal bc she finally thought she was getting included in something special? Or on the flipside, is she used to being super popular and feeling threatened by something? \n\nAlso there's another post rn on AITA about a girl who missed prom because of her mom grounding her. I would recommend reading it. No halloween makes sense, but no prom? Why is something next may already decided? Do you think 6 months of isolation will make her learn a lesson, or do you think it'll make her depressed and vulnerable? My money's on the latter, tbh. If her issue is self-loathing or bullying or something, I think the way your family is handling this might make it worse.\n\nGive her a chance to make this up. Give her encouragement to get better and be better. What's an actually doable amount of money to earn in ~3 months? Can that be a benchmark for getting back some privileges? What's a feasible amount that she could earn by prom? Stuff like that. Make her pay the whole thing back, but find a balanced timeline for her to achieve it. Feeling like your family will hate you forever no matter what you do is exactly the kind of mindset that makes a teen make worse and worse decisions, because they think they have nothing to lose. Don't make her think that way.", "Well I would say it makes you a mild AH if you celebrate, grinning from ear to ear or jumping up and down clapping when they are punished. It\u2019s normal to feel that way on the inside though as long as you hide your glee externally.", "Rita did it you, her dad fixes it in an effective way without Rita physically harmed. If Rita didn\u2019t get caught, she\u2019d do it to someone outside the family; they would not react as nicely as her dad. \n\nThis is necessary.", "NTA, but Richard\u2019s punishment is far too harsh and will backfire.", "You might want to check your card's transaction history", "This, I didn't know how to verbalise it, you've said it very well. She is a kid but needed this lesson hope she does realise and not resent you for this.", "She might not be klepto per se but go through a klepto stage to keep up with their friends.  Sometimes it cements but often they grow out of it.", "\u2665\ufe0f", "This should be waaaaay higher up.", "That was my thought too. Especially since her card declined.", "The good thing about being a kleptomaniac is that you can always take something for it. \n\n\nI will show myself out now\u2026", "Right?!"]}
