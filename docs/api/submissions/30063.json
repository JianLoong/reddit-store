Kudos to your stepdad for having your back.", "Positively NTA.  \nYou're so lucky that you have a decent step-father and that he did the right thing!!

This is the first major pushback she's had against her stealing habit at home at least, and it's pushbacks like this that inform limits.", "That's something he has to work out with my mom. I think it started because my stepdad put a limit on her spending. She had a credit card for emergencies, used it pretty well until she started this year... He got her a bus pass, gave her a VISA with a certain amount on it, and told her that was her new limit. When it's done, it's done.", "Yeah, I'm hoping they get the stepsister into therapy or something. This is *a lot* of stealing, not a one-off bad decision. It kind of suggests that something bigger is going on.", "It seems he has learned that to be a step dad you have to step up. I am lucky enought o have had an awesome bonus dad (miss you pops). NTA and it gives me the warm fuzzies that you and your mum a have a good guy in your life. He is doing the hard part of parenting. By addressing this now and teaching her the lesson now he is likely saving her future. I hope she finds her way and you and your mom can find yor way to forgiveness if she earns it. Best wishes to you all.", "NTA and step dad rocks! Rita learned consequence.", "NTA.  You did the right thing.  Right now she's a thief.  By getting in so much trouble she'll hopefully rethink her behavior.  If she goes around stealing from non family members, she can get into legal trouble or people might take the law into their own hands.  Actions have consequences.  These are the consequences.", "NTA for sure, and make sure Step-Dad gets an awesome gift around the holidays and something better than a mug, slippers or tie for fathers day.", "Yeah he sounds great. She deserves it. She needs therapy too. Is she a klepto? NTA", "I'm still saying NTA.  When my mother died, she died alone in her bed in a tiny room in a shitty house - because the only child willing to take care of her HADN'T been the golden child she had given many thousands of dollars to (she literally stole my father's retirement money to buy the daughter she loved a house.)\n\nTo this day I feel deeply smug that she went out that way, because she was a vile hateful person who ruined my father's life.\n\nI see this as being the same, just smaller.  Rita ain't dead, and she's perfectly able to come back from this by being remorseful, NOT STEALING, and suffering some consequences for her actions.\n\nThink about this in a different way - what if she got busted stealing from a store in a couple years when she's 18, and went to jail?  How would theft look for college applications or job applications?", "Would you rather she get some consequences from her dad now that \"ruin\" her *social* life for a while or consequences a few years from now from someone else that involves phrases like \"5 to 10 with a possibility for parole\"? Something that might really ruin her life.\n\nAm I saying that she was guaranteed to move into actual criminal theft if she hadn't been caught? No. There's a chance that she would have matured and stopped, or kept it at the level of swiping vapes, makeup and clothes from family/roommates.\n\nBut at the same time, there is a chance that she would have progressed to stealing from businesses or strangers. Heck, even if she just kept it at stealing from family & roommates, she might still go too far.\n\nThat you are feeling the way you are, as one of her victims, is understandable. At the same time, it is good that you are bothered by the fact that you do feel this way. Such self-reflection can be an opportunity for growth as a person.\n\nOne thing that you can do that might help there... become an advocate for getting her professional help. As in therapy. Unless your step-sister is secretly a cat, there is likely some reason why she's been stealing. And it's not likely to be that she's a secret Jane's Addiction fan either. Something is likely going on in her life that you and her dad/your mom aren't aware of. Something that needs to be addressed.\n\nAdvocating to get her the help needed to deal with whatever that something is will be the next best thing you can do for her after having told her dad in the first placr.", "To paraphrase a popular saying, you are not happy at her conviction for theft.  But you're reading the verdict with some satisfaction", "She is the one who ruined her own life for the next year. And she's old enough to learn that actions have consequences.\n\nI guess she thought she'd never be caught??? She sounds like a serious klepto.", "Schadenfreude is a natural feeling", "Eh sometimes we're all a bit vindictive.  She screwed you over and did something really hurtful.   You're allowed to feel a little justice.", "From what you have said and described in comments/post I would say you are a wonderful person. Because you love her you should know that this lesson may very well save her future. Because you love her she has a chance to earn your forgiveness and get a second chance. It is normal to feel vindicated especially when something hurt you. This next year may be hard for her but it may be the thing that helps her become a better person and make the choices that prevent worse consequences in the future. You are most def NTA and your caring soul warms mine and gives me faith.", "She did something wrong, and now she's being punished for it. You're NTA, and if she gives you any shit for \"Telling\" or suchlike, remind her that she's the one who stole so much stuff from you and your mom. If she hadn't done that, she wouldn't be in this situation, and she wouldn't be so embarrassed.", "Still NTA. It generally does feel good seeing people get appropriate consequences for their actions. \n\nCurious though, did you confirm if she\u2019d been taking your debit card and putting it back before you could notice?", "At least she can make things up to OP and her mom with time, the courts aren't as forgiving.", "I think you know that you've had enough reddit for the day when you suddenly find yourself picturing a cat wearing a Jane's Addiction t-shirt sneaking around stealing things. Definitely not an image I ever thought would pop in my head until I read your comment, so thanks I guess?"]}
