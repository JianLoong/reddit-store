I tried to invite myself along periodically in the early years but there was always a reason it wouldn't work out (they had friends coming, they already rented the house and it wasn't big enough, etc).  After several unsuccessful attempts I stopped asking, but I once attempted to set up a lunch since I was passing through the same area.  They said the children would be busy at the beach, so no.\n\nOver the years, they began inviting other siblings, until 6 years ago my sister Cara (F36), my sister Darlene (42) were both going and my sister Ella (F35) had also been invited but couldn't get off work.\n\nI tried to hide my hurt feelings after that when they would all discuss beach plans in front of me and what a good time they had had when they returned.  \n\nThe following year they were talking about their beach plans again and I decided to focus on doing something fun myself rather than feeling left out.  I made plans to go on a trip elsewhere with a friend.\n\nWhen the trip came around, I went on the trip with my friend and was having a great time...and then found out that my parents had also joined my four siblings, and that my fifth sibling, Ella (F35) had again been invited but couldn't go.\n\nI have pretty extreme anxiety, PTSD and Depression, and I had been talking with my therapist about how best to process all this and at this point I texted Darlene and said that I loved them, but that I was hurt and needed to take some time away from the family, for the sake of my mental health.  I disconnected with all of my family members on social media.  Her only response was \"I don't know what to say\".  \n\n\nI didn't cut my family off, I just set up some massive boundaries so I could learn how to better cope at being left out without feeling so hurt by it all.  I didn't think I could change them, but I could change how I dealt with them.  Yay weekly therapy!  And I was doing much better by the following year...had even started softening some of those boundaries.    \n\n\nWhen family trip time came along, my dad invited me along, but when I inquired about the rental, I found it was strictly pet free.  I travel with my ESA because of my anxiety.  I told him I couldn't without my dog.  \n\nThis year when vacation was mentioned, I asked Darlene if  they had gotten the same rental.  She said \"yes, and you should come!\" and I reiterated that the house wasn't dog friendly.  Her response was \"several of us are allergic to dogs and didn't want a rental where other people had had dogs\".  \n\n\nI said ok, but am rolling my eyes at that response, because the people who are allergic to dogs have ALL HAD PET DOGS.\n\nAnyways I was venting to a friend and she said I was being too hard on my family and they had invited me along, so what else did I want from them?  So now I'm asking myself AITA by holding grudges or letting my anxiety make too big a deal of this?", "created_utc": 1667234840, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yihbi0/aita_for_not_going_on_the_family_vacation_because/", "score": 48, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Once that happened, you parents panicked.\n\nNotice how it was your father who invited you?\n\nYeah...that was a tell tale sign.\n\nYour brother's are the ones who organize these trips.  Why weren't they the ones who invited you?\n\nBecause your father put his foot down and said the family had to stop excluding you.  \n\nHere is my guess. \n\nFor whatever reason, your siblings have decided that family functions are better without you there.  Maybe it's the age gap.  Maybe they don't like how your mom and dad dealt with your anxiety and catered to it.  Whatever the case may be, this is purposeful.\n\nWhich is why over the years, they have done these trips but always found ways to exclude you.\n\nThe \"dog allergy\" issue is not an issue at all either.  As you said, some of them have dogs.\n\nYour father flat out told them they had to start inviting you.  And since you have an ESA, they decided to find a no pets only rental and then defend it with \"allergy\" excuses because they knew you wouldn't come without your ESA\n\nIf I were you, I would tell your parents that you believe that your siblings don't want you around and that all these years, they were going out of their way to purposefully exclude you from family holidays.  And that even now, they are still excluding you by going out of their way to choose a rental that will not accommodate your ESA.\n\nThen I would tell your parents that moving forward, you are going no contact with your siblings and will only maintain a relationship with them.  That you are sorry for the problems this will create and that the will not have the great big happy family that they want, but that you are tired of the way you are being treated and you are not going to tolerate it anymore.\n\nTell them that you know your siblings don't want you around so you are going to give them what they want and that no matter what, you are not changing your mind on this.\n\nAs for your friend, they are not looking at the big picture.  Again, you being invited was mandatory because of your dad...but your siblings still found a way to exclude you.\n\nIgnore your friend.  \n\nThey don't have all the information", "NTA - Leaving your dog would negatively impact your experience. Why would you be the asshole?\n\nYour writing felt heavy and sad; I get it. Would you feel better telling your family you've felt left out over the years and ask are their ways you could be included?  Its like your are suffering doubly; by the experience and by not stating your experience.  Inquiring if they have interest in changing/including you in a vacation can be a painful and/or rewarding experience. When you speak your truth others will know and have the option to respond. Up to now you are the only one going through and pain of the experience. Best to you. Most look to siblings to support and enrich our lives but this is not always the case. - Best  to you.", "NTA idk whats wrong with your family tbh but go very LC or NC, keep your boundaries , they aren't nice people", "INFO: why was the rest of your family--especially your parents-- OK with you being excluded from these vacations?", "NTA it sounds like they aren't considering your feelings or needs at all. Take your puppy on a fun vacation just the two of you and celebrate not having to deal with your toxic family.", "NTA - full stop! \n\n\nYou are doing great taking care of yourself and your own mental health. From the sound of it you should stay on that path.", "NTA sounds perfectly reasonable to maintain your boundaries not to mention the fact that they directly lied to your face about being allergic to dogs when they have them themselves ... If i were you id go no contact your family is clearly full of liars so you aren't missing out on anything at all ... Cut the ties that bind you will be happier... They clearly have no problem excluding you with no love lost on their part as they clearly don't care so you have nothing actually binding you to them beyond the illusions you carry and some genetic material", "I feel like we\u2019re missing something here. If your anxiety is so bad that you can\u2019t go without an ESA, is it possible that your anxiety has put a damper on past get-togethers with the family?\n\nYou\u2019re definitely NTA, but I just wonder if there is a history of your anxiety negatively affecting gatherings (ie needing to change plans or activities for it)", "INFO: Why are you the only one that's never invited? They invite all the siblings and your shared parents but never you. Was there an incident that happened in the past you left out? Its one thing for brothers to just go but then they started including everyone but you. Seems like something has been left out?", "NTA. Your family sounds like trash.", "INFO\n\nIt is surprising that your younger siblings and parents were invited before you.I think you are leaving a big piece of information out of this story. How did you know who are the 'several of us' ? So yeah you are leaving out a big chunck of information and making the story to your favour and you being the victim.", "NTA  and I truly sympathize with you, that is so hard. My family had a reunion and everyone was invited but myself and my family. I found out after when my sister posted a picture and then I got gaslighted being told it was an \"oversight\" which was bullshit )30 people went to Disney and not one person mentioned it to me and it was an oversight???).. I'm so glad you're in therapy and I live by the same guidelines. I can't control other people's behavior but I can control my own. I would go back to planning a vacation with your friends and leave the family in the rear view, that's what I've done and you'll be happier for it. It's what I do and I've had some really fun vacations", "INFO  \nDespite your covering a number of issues, there isn't enough to name or shame anyone. There seem to be several issues that all come together but might better be addressed one by one.   \nIf your family are all currently dog free and you bring your dog to every other family event, that can be annoying no matter how well behaved or friendly the dog. Much of the world is tired of ESAs due to so many people abusing the concept.   \nIf you are simply the youngest and single and no prospects in sight and you complain about that, your family may be tired of that. If you are the mope in a family of easy going, enjoy the hell out of vacation types that would have some bearing.   \nIn any event going LC or NC isn't going to endear you to some of your family, but that seems the best option for you and your mental health.   \nFamily simply due to blood isn't necessary for all of us. Make a family of found friends and invest time in them.", "Info: there's something missing here. How did you attempt to invite yourself along at first. Were you not respecting their boundaries? Could that be why everyone got invites before you?", "You aren't being too hard on your family. They exclude you, (intentionally it seems?) And you've decided to opt out of the allowing them to have that small power over you. Good for you. This is only a problem if you feel hurt by not being with them?\n\nI come from a large family and the simple fact of it is that family can be wonderful and they can be an emotional burden too. I only want to deal with the wonderful parts at this point.\n\nIf they have to feel like an emotional burden - they don't need me for that part. I'm out. (We're adults for heaven's sake - not children.)\n\nNTA", "YTA.  \n\nYou made a large deal about not being invited and then turned down the invite when offered.  Couldn't you have found a rental nearby that allowed dogs?", "YTA. Family trumps dogs. Even if you feel like your dog is family to you, it\u2019s a dog. You can\u2019t compare their CHILDREN to your dog. Airlines don\u2019t recognize \u201cESA\u201d pets, nor do most vacation rental properties or hotels. They invited you, but you want to bring a pet\u2026 to the rental property they\u2019re paying for that probably doesn\u2019t accept pets. So that\u2019s why YTA.\n\nYou didn\u2019t attend the family vacations for years. Now you want to, but want to bring a pet. If you want to attend, travel there and get your OWN rental property that YOU pay for. You can\u2019t expect your family to pay for a rental property that will accept your pet. Many have pet fees for cleaning or pet deposits, and few people want to deal with pets on a vacation. An \u201cESA\u201d pet is NOT a trained service dog. Trained service dogs have legal rights and extensive training that makes them hardly noticeable and legally allowed in more places. \u201cESA\u201d pets do not have any of those rights nor training.\n\nYour siblings are inconsiderate for vacationing without you all those years ago, but they\u2019re adults and they\u2019re allowed to vacation with who they choose to. You could\u2019ve come up with a vacation idea to invite them to, but you didn\u2019t. Them inviting most of the siblings, not you, sucks\u2026 but it sounds like that naturally evolved over the years.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But is it possible that they can\u2019t relax around you or aren\u2019t comfortable hanging around you because of your anxiety?", "NTA", "You need to focus, love, and invest on yourself, nc with them. Build meaningful new relationships. Have a happy life. Lots of love for you \u2764\ufe0f", "My family has done the same to me my whole life. It feels really crappy to be left out. I went LC and they blame everything on me. Family sucks.", "Nta. But I suspect this treatment and your family is the cause for your anxiety and mental health issues. They're the reason you have the Esa dog.", "Not going to say N T A but not sure Y T A either. Often times people are not the best judge of themselves, or their dogs. So many people say their dogs are perfectly trained and they are most definitely NOT well behaved. And sometimes people who have anxiety can react very differently when kids are around and rambunctious. When my kids were younger my siblings and I had kids that all played together but one had an in-law that could not handle them and tried to impose quiet time and not what the parents wanted for their kids. And what the kids ate or drank. They meant well, but it was what they wanted rather than what we had planned for our get togethers.", "That was my first thought, as well. Now that they are finally extending an invitation (after being forced to) for OP to join them, they purposely choose a pet-free place, knowing OP will not come as a result. \n\nKind of an evil Malicious Compliance, imo. \n\nI bet they never rented a pet-free place in all the years before this, up until they were told by dad to invite OP.", "Your theory is my anxiety's theory as well, but I never know whether to trust that nut. Maybe I should just ask my parents on a trip with me....", "Excellent points", "I believe my family loves me and in a crisis, they do come through, but in every day things they just don't consider me.  I don't know why.  I've tried to be more included in smaller things.  Its hard to be more aggressive about my feelings... in the past its seemed like they feel its all on my head.", "I think with my siblings its because it simply doesn't OCCUR to them to invite me to most things.  Like, several live within a few blocks of each other, so they get together for coffee often.  I've mentioned on more than one occasion that I would like to be included in these invites as well and was told they don't think  to invite me because I live so far away (30 minutes).  I've wondered if maybe its because they all had kids, but Darlene doesnt, so...I'm not sure.\n\nI think my parents DID feel badly once they found out I was upset, which is part of the reason why they started renting the beach house and inviting everyone.", "I don't understand my family dynamics and feel like I'M missing something as well.  \n\nNo one else in my life treats me similarly, so I really just don't know....", "I'm only guessing because they don't say anything beyond the types of excuses I've shared, but I'm a little different from the rest of the family?  I've come up with theories over the years, like maybe its because they are more conservative than me? Or because of my anxiety? Or because I'm vegetarian? Maybe its just a matter of being the odd one out.  I never feel like I am actively excluded, just...forgotten about.", "Only left out information for the sake of brevity.  She named all 5 people who had dog allergies.\n\nI believe that trip where my parents joined them, my parents had a different rental.  I don't know if they decided to go at the same time, or if that was coincidence.  My parents had often gone to that area to visit their own friends.", "Sometimes people with no children have lesser value in a family? Don't know that this is OP's deal. But, I've seen it before lots of times. The grandchildren are supposed to mean more in a family than her dog. That's the only reason to draw the line at her dog being there if they've all been dog owners in the past.", "I don't bring the dog to most events.  He is superbly trained and behaved, but I only bring him with me when I'm on my own or traveling overnight.  The entire family is not dog free.  \n\nI'm not the youngest, or single (married, just childfree), and not a big complainer.  I'm generally a positive, upbeat person when not dealing with an anxiety issue.  \n\nI honestly don't know if its not just a matter of I don't fit with them (bunch of circles and I'm a triangle or whatever).  While it makes absolutely no sense to me, seems they simply forget about me.  Believing that, for the most part, they don't act out of intentional malice, I just sort of want to make sure that in protecting my mental well-being I'm not being a jerk.", "Its been a long time, so I can't remember exactly, but I know I would have been non-pushy about it.  But, I was in my early twenties and my anxiety was as yet undiagnosed at that time, nor had I been in therapy, so its possible I may not have been as self aware back then.    \nI've wondered if it might all be because I AM a little different than everyone else in the family.   They are all more conservative and mental health isn't a comfy topic for them.", "What the fuck are you on?  it's an emotional support animal. It's gonna go where she goes. The rental doesn't allow animals. Would you want to go on a family vacation and be separated because they wanted to be DICKS and not accommodate you? Like it's very clear her family doesn't like her. Like at all. You lack compassion and empathy just like her toxic relatives.", "I did look into rentals nearby and I \\*could\\* get one a few miles away, but its very expensive to rent a house at the beach by myself.", "Glad you know they're there in a crisis but it would feel great to be intentionally included, invited and thought of when your world is not on fire. I don't know if taking the initiative to plan and invite them is successful; either way, take care of yourself. Build and strengthen those who support you. Glad you posted to obtain a 'vote' and input.", "30 minutes???  Yeah like that\u2019s a deal breaker???  WTF", "Maybe having an open conversation with your family about why you haven\u2019t been invited could clear some things up. Either way, don\u2019t let them negatively affect your mental health. Take all the space you need if they are hurting you\u2019re feelings", "Okay on the childcare part I agree. No one should be discriminated against for having or not having kids. But how do you know who the \"several of us\"", "I've wondered if it might be the childfree thing.  I think I'm a great aunt, but the rest of my siblings have all always wanted to be parents.", "I provided childcare for all of the kids in my very large family long before I had any kids of my own. Sometimes, people in families relegate us to roles that they see us fulfilling and have nothing to do with who we are or how we see ourselves. And then they figure you also think the grandkids are more important than you are. Its kind of crazy. But, I've seen it before. My sister was shocked and told me I was thinking inappropriately when I confessed one day: I love kids in general. But, of course, my dog is more important to me than somebody else's kid. I don't have kids. So everybody with kids needs to get off their arse and manage.\ud83d\ude02"]}
