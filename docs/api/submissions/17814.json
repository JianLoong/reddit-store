The English word thug traces its roots to the Hindi \u0920\u0917 (\u1e6dhag), which means 'swindler' or 'deceiver'. Related words are the verb thugna ('to deceive'), from the Sanskrit \u0938\u094d\u0925\u0917 (sthaga 'cunning, sly, fraudulent') and \u0938\u094d\u0925\u0917\u0924\u093f (sthagati, 'he conceals').[2] This term, describing the murder and robbery of travellers, was popular in the northern parts of the Indian subcontinent, especially northern and eastern regions of historical India (present-day northern/eastern India and Bangladesh)\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thuggee", "Its from rap culture and in the USA can definitely be used as a slur for black person.\n\nEdit for clarity: \u201cIt\u201d being the usage people are talking about.
