So, to preface this, I'll admit that I have a bad habit of leaving glasses of water next to my feet on the floor next to the couch. My(F23) boyfriend (M28)has gotten irritated a couple of times after getting off the couch and knocking over a drink with his feet.\n\nI'll admit this is an annoying habit, but my boyfriend works construction and EVERY DAY he leaves metal work boots, toolboxes and random tools on our floors/ in the hallway so he can't get too mad. However, he is definitely the type to be very angry/ over dramatic about spills in the house, as his mother was very strict.\n\nANYWAY, yesterday whilst at work he called me and was SO angry. He claims he tripped on a glass of water next to the couch, tripped into the side table which then knocked half a cup of coffee onto his brand new MacBook. Of course I tried to comfort him but he wouldn't accept this.\n\nHe was shouting, swearing and telling me I had to pay for the repairs as it was my fault for leaving a glass there. When I explained he shouldn't have left his MacBook on a small side table with a cup next to it, he went crazy and said he was 'completely done' with me.\n\nWe've lived together for over a year and he hasn't shown me any affection since this happened two days ago. He won't tell me he loves me and picks at everything I say. He watches me do all of the cooking/ housework and just asks me for beers. He has been drinking more since this happened too.\n\nI've sat him down and explained how much he's hurting my feelings and that I'm worth more than a laptop which will be fixed in 3 days time- but he just doesn't care. It's seriously like he despises me.\n\nSo, AITA? I wasn't even home when this happened, but apparently I have to take all of the blame and the financial repercussions (\u00a3400 approx).\n\nTLDR; my boyfriend tripped over a glass I left on the floor, thus knocking a cup of coffee onto his laptop in the process.

After leaving liquid glasses on the floor and tripping over them multiple times? An adult would try really hard to change the behavior. Same with him and his tools. If you guys aren't willing to make the effort to change those little things? How are you supposed to have a healthy relationship. \n\nIf he did actually trip over one of your glasses, and the domino effect caused his laptop to be damaged, yes its your fault. One, you weren't home which means you not only set glasses down, you leave them there for extended periods. Two you then told him he shouldn't be keeping his coffee on a side table with his laptop, which is ACTUALLY exactly where glasses with liquid are meant to be. Do you guys not have a friggin coffee table in front of your couch? That's where most people would put a drink. \n\nThis entire story sounds like two young people who are mentally unprepared for an actual relationship. From your problems, to how you communicate and respond to these things. \n\nI've been with my SO for 4 years, we haven't fought or yelled at eachother once. I had a habit of leaving empty coke containers and such. She brought it up, I fixed it. That's an adult relationship.", "Omg. My 5 year old son does the same. Cups of water and drink everywhere.

If my SO wouldn\u2019t do something as small as set the glass on the end table instead of the floor, even after I expressed multiple times that it bothered me, then I would be hurt and angry. \n\nThis reminds me of often cited story of the man that doesn\u2019t understand why his wife left him just because he wouldn\u2019t put the dishes in the dishwasher. \n\nEdit:  found it. \n\nhttps://www.huffpost.com/entry/she-divorced-me-i-left-dishes-by-the-sink_b_9055288/amp", "He\u2019s probably also upset with your reaction and lack of apology.

If you want to salvage the relationship, and if it is possible at this point, you will need to give a real apology with no \u201cbut you did this also\u201d kind of statement.

And here you are, mad at his reaction instead of acknowledging that what you were doing was wrong and led to this situation.", "ESH- not leaving glasses around on the floor when you\u2019re not even home or using them is totally reasonable, but yeah he\u2019s looking for a reason to end it so just part ways, seems like you two aren\u2019t a good fit.", "Eh, ESH. There\u2019s no reason to be leaving cups on the floor. I can see if you\u2019re there, using the cup, and setting it on the floor is the closest place to place it. But you weren\u2019t even there. You just left a cup sitting on the floor. His leaving his gear on the floor is just a two wrongs don\u2019t make a right. But his reaction is wildly disproportionate. He wanted an out and your cup created that out.", "ESH. As someone who lives with the male version of the little girl from Signs, I can assure you I contemplate murder every time I do a sweep and come back with 8 or 10 glasses half full of water. This is _so_ annoying. However, he\u2019s a grown ass man and can pick up the glass and put it on the table or in the dish washer.

If your habit is really more important to you than your friend, you simply don't fit, if it's so important for him.", "ESH. His reaction may have been extreme, but pick up your glasses. It\u2019s not just an annoying habit, it\u2019s dangerous. Someone could break their ankle tripping over one, or break a glass and cut themselves. Maybe instead of telling him you\u2019re worth more than a laptop, tell him you realize\nhow dangerous it is to leave glasses on the floor, and will commit to never doing it again. Just get a coffee table.", "YTA, and everyone suc#s here.\n\nHe has a serious temper problem.  He needs to get it under control before he attempts a long term relationship.\n\nYou don't think his complaints about leaving full glasses of liquid, in a path of travel on the floor, have any merit.  You continue to leave water/drink glasses on the floor, and don't seem to have any plans to change.  It is your fault he tripped, and your fault his computer were damaged.  \n\nPerhaps the best thing for both of you would be to separate, grow up, and find someone else.  Lots of men would have learned to control their temper at age 23, but sometimes it takes a bit longer.  Lots of people would have made an effort to stop a behavior that is upsetting their SO, but you have not.  \n\nI would be ashamed to lose my temper with my spouse for something so small, but I would expect them to change the bad habit, or at least make an effort to change.", "Maybe unpopular opinion but, having had an ex boyfriend who did exactly what you do (leave full of half full glasses or bottles of beer on the floor near our couch or bed), this SUCKS.

He told you multiple times it was annoying, you kept doing it because you couldn't be bothered, so for that YTA.", "YTA. He has a legitimate grievance against you, and yes, this is your fault. Why are you leaving things that can be easily tripped over where nobody would expect them to be? You have a side table - use it.

I don\u2019t leave glasses of beverages on the floor though. Terrible habit. Do better. Seriously. As for him- he did spill his own drink on his laptop- so that is his own fault for leaving his laptop next to a drink, but he said he tripped over your glass on the floor. His anger doesn\u2019t need to be so bad over it especially if you are paying to fix the laptop. \n\nBut seriously, while his actions are harsh, it is your fault- pick the damn glasses up off the floor and stop leaving them everywhere!!", "Yta, leaving a drink on the floor is a party foul. You owe him a new pc.", "ESH.  He's repeatedly asked you to stop doing something that is frankly childish and lazy, but he's taking this to the nth degree and is wrong too.  Hopefully cooler heads will prevail.  And my .02 is that his increased drinking is to deal with the pain of potentially breaking up.  I agree with other posters, he's probably been mulling this a while and this is the event he's using to spring it on you.", "YTA. He has had to tell you repeatedly about the same issue and now it has caused dire consequences. You don\u2019t seem to learn your lesson and he is tired of dealing with it.

Like you both continue to do things you know will make the other mad little things that can snowball into an avalanche of bad attitude because you are so tired of not being heard. You are TA for continuing to leave mold hazards everywhere and he is the TA because he leaves toe breakers everywhere while you both continue to ask the other to stop. Then neither of you stop cause you are waiting for the other to do it first like children.", "YTA.  He has talked to you about this before.  You knew it was a thing he didn't like, and that it was important to him, and you chose not to put in any effort at all.  And it wound up causing financial distress, which it sounds like you didn't even have the decency to offer to cover??  If I caused damage like that with my carelessness, you better believe I am sheepishly paying for all of it and begging forgiveness...but it wouldn't even have gotten that far because when my partner says something is important to him I LISTEN and make an effort.\n\nThis sounds like it's been an ongoing problem and has finally pushed him over the edge.  Totally understandable.", "ESH.  As someone who lives with someone in construction as well, I get that it's fucking infuriating.  I'm constantly tripping over random stuff, like papers, extension cords, impact drivers, screw boxes.  It all has a place, and its place is not in the walkways.\n\nOn the other hand I always get shit on for leaving paperwork on the table, and I do find it annoying that when I get that pointed out because I'm always having to parkour my way through the house.\n\nHOWEVER. Two wrongs don't make a right.  His stuff is a problem, but it doesn't mean that you can leave glasses of water - which are arguably more hazardous than boots or (some) tools, because glasses of water can shatter and cut deeply - next to places people walk.  If he points out I left my paperwork out on the table, I put it away the same way I expect him to when he leaves his stuff out.  I don't say, \"well your shit is all over the place too!\" and keep on making his life difficult by taking out counter space, because all that does is allow him to make mine difficult by taking out walking space.", "ESH\n\n>I'll admit that I have a bad habit of leaving glasses of water next to my feet on the floor next to the couch...

I wasn't even home when this happened.\n\nIt's one thing to leave a glass on the floor next to you when you're home. Once you're ready to leave, make sure that anything that could cause a mess is picked up -- other people shouldn't be expected to be psychic and know where you're leaving glasses of liquid or to carefully creep around the home just in case they might knock over the 30 glasses you've left sitting around.\n\nIt's been three days -- he's upset about the expense of fixing the laptop and isn't required to repeatedly tell you he loves you and give you affection, but he should be a partner in keeping your home clean.

Your laziness that he has already discussed previously has now caused a chain of events that messed up something brand new and expensive.  And even then, you can't take responsibility, and you blame him - as if him having his macbook on the table is more absurd than you leaving a cup of water on the floor for the 100th time? \n\nWhat would have your self defending excuse been if he had slipped in that water and injured himself? Knock out some teeth, crack his head open, or break an arm trying to catch a fall? \n\nAnd now you can't figure out why he isn't being affectionate?

So, to preface this, I'll admit that I have a bad habit of leaving glasses of water next to my feet on the floor next to the couch. My(F23) boyfriend (M28)has gotten irritated a couple of times after getting off the couch and knocking over a drink with his feet.\n\nI'll admit this is an annoying habit, but my boyfriend works construction and EVERY DAY he leaves metal work boots, toolboxes and random tools on our floors/ in the hallway so he can't get too mad. However, he is definitely the type to be very angry/ over dramatic about spills in the house, as his mother was very strict.\n\nANYWAY, yesterday whilst at work he called me and was SO angry. He claims he tripped on a glass of water next to the couch, tripped into the side table which then knocked half a cup of coffee onto his brand new MacBook. Of course I tried to comfort him but he wouldn't accept this.\n\nHe was shouting, swearing and telling me I had to pay for the repairs as it was my fault for leaving a glass there. When I explained he shouldn't have left his MacBook on a small side table with a cup next to it, he went crazy and said he was 'completely done' with me.\n\nWe've lived together for over a year and he hasn't shown me any affection since this happened two days ago. He won't tell me he loves me and picks at everything I say. He watches me do all of the cooking/ housework and just asks me for beers. He has been drinking more since this happened too.\n\nI've sat him down and explained how much he's hurting my feelings and that I'm worth more than a laptop which will be fixed in 3 days time- but he just doesn't care. It's seriously like he despises me.\n\nSo, AITA? I wasn't even home when this happened, but apparently I have to take all of the blame and the financial repercussions (\u00a3400 approx).\n\nTLDR; my boyfriend tripped over a glass I left on the floor, thus knocking a cup of coffee onto his laptop in the process. He know says he is 'completely done' with me after two years. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Like, if this were the first time you\u2019d left a glass on the floor or if it were the first time it had caused an issue, it wouldn\u2019t be such a big deal. But it\u2019s not the first time, or the second or third. To turn it around on him that he shouldn\u2019t have left his laptop on a table with other things that belong on tables?

Thanks u/jrm1102!", "Stale water is the worst!", "True.", "That\u2019s my thought exactly.", "Well, seems like it doesn't sit well with her that he does it or where he puts them.\n\nDon't disagree that water on the floor is dumb AF.", "2 things can be true at the same time: leaving glasses of water on the floor is an idiot move.\n\nAlso, leaving machinery /tools on the floor is also an idiot move, regardless if he needs them for work. \n\nThey are as much of a tripping hazard, if not potentially more dangerous (I say as I had to go to the ER due to someone doing that very thing he does).", "Normal behavior??? Come on! What's the difference if the mess is by the door?", "Yes. And OP says she wasn\u2019t even at home like it\u2019s a defence! It makes it significantly worse IMO. It\u2019s one thing to leave a glass of water in a convenient-to-where-you\u2019re-sitting floor spot when you\u2019re actually sitting there, but it needs to be cleared away once you\u2019re not sitting there any more.\n\nIt\u2019s the last straw for OP\u2019s boyfriend. If OP is really bothered by the boots and toolboxes then they should agree on parting ways; issues like that shouldn\u2019t be used as a \u201cbut you\u2019re bad too so you have to accept what I do\u201d retort.\n\nHis behaviour now is terrible, so I agree with ESH.", ">Honestly, the attempt to equate these two habits just feels like AITA's classic preference for judging a man harsher than a woman, all things being equal.\n\nI don't think this is sexism so much as it is getting caught in the OP's self-indulgent narrative.", "In the hallways could be worse, if there's a spot to put them elsewhere and the hallways narrow. Especially if it's not like he's neatly doing it.", "Cup of water: can be cleaned up or left to air dry.\n\nTool box: broken toe.  \n\nYeah, it's the water that would bother most people. /s", "I don't know. In my house drinks go on the floor. We don't have a dining room table or coffee table right now. But then it's always something someone is drinking at the moment.", "Right. You accidentally kick some shoes you just move on with your day. \n\nYou kick a glass of water now you have to spend time cleaning it up. \n\nMy wife has a habit of not pushing in freezer drawers all the way in so the door doesn\u2019t get a tight seal. Next thing you know I\u2019m spending 1/2 hour defrosting the freezer and getting all the ice out of the drawers. Annoying. \n\nNow compare that with not closing a cabinet door shut all the way. You shut it and move on with your day.", "Or just pick it up when she gets up. Not go out while leaving it behind.", "Clearly they have a side table and she just doesn't use them.", ">why on earth don\u2019t you buy a coffee table or a side table for the couch?\n\nThey already have one, that's what the laptop was on.  Just makes it all worse.", "Honestly, without even caring who the AH is, I\u2019m second hand irritated and angry at her for leaving cups of water on the floor. Who does that???

But I suspect it won\u2019t\u2026", "Because it sounds like he keeps his tools out on the floor in the hallway, whereas we *know* that OP leaves glasses of water on the floor by the couch.", "I still think it's reasonable to expect everyone in a household to be considerate and not leave stuff lying around where it can get in someone's way, that's all I'm saying.", "Bruh is leaving them in the way that's the issue.", "Leaving a glass beside a sofa is pretty benign.  Making it out to be a reason to break up is absurd and not worse than boots or tools on the floor.  \n\nAs others have said, this was the straw that broke the camels back.   It is the excuse for a breakup, not the reason", "The cycle of tradesmen. Tools go in the toolbox, toolbox goes in the cabinet and then the cabinet goes in the workshop.

He knows where those shoes have been and it\u2019s gross. Even if you\u2019re not in a dirty trade, your shoes still get disgusting on the job.\n\nI just installed the IKEA Hemnes shoe cabinet in my house (801.561.20, if you\u2019re interested) and I always thought any shoe cabinet like that wouldn\u2019t fit my boots. I tried proving my boyfriend wrong while we were in IKEA, so I took one shoe off to test it. It fit. Tried the other one and was overjoyed when I realized they both fit in the same compartment!", "I literally do that everyday and have managed to never spill. It's what side tables are for? What do you use your side table for?

It's a table and you're not a toddler. Things can exist on it without being knocked over.", "Well I live in stupid reality unfortunately. The choice to drink your coffee at your computer in the morning instead of from the kitchen or a non existent break room is a common choice. Unlike leaving glasses on the floor at the foot of your couch in the living room. \n\nI'm not saying it wasn't smart, it's just not his fault. He was being careful, he didn't spill his coffee. There's a good chance it would have broken the screen or something regardless of drink. \n\n it's 80/20 but that hardly matters when it come to financially being responsible", "Yep, no denying she don't need to be leaving the water on the floor. But girl would have to absolutely punt it to get it near a socket?? And you've clearly never tripped over a toolbox or work boots? I'd rather have a wet floor than busted toes.", "Very true! While we can only judge based on the information we have now, some background information would be good and might change the game!", "You don\u2019t need to look down at the floor everywhere you go to not step on a glass that\u2019s next to the sofa. \n\nJust look before you put your feet down when you get up off said sofa, and don\u2019t walk into the path of the glass. Everyone looks out for obstacles in their path which includes the floor. \n\nIs it annoying that she doesn\u2019t pick up after herself? Yes. Is she at fault for boyfriend being clumsy and not watching where he was going? Hell no.\n\nAnd on top of that - even if she\u2019d spilled coffee on the MacBook her damn self, ignoring her for two days (which is a tool of emotional abuse) and not helping with household chores, threatening to end a long term relationship is unhealthy and disproportionate.", "You've gone off on one about shards of glass. The point is that although op should be more thoughtful and work on remembering to put glass on table etc, he left the coffee next to the macbook which was just as much of an accident waiting to happen as the glass on the floor. You can say had the glass not been there he wouldn't have tripped but if the coffee hadn't been there it wouldn't have spilled. How far do you want to take this back? There are a million other ways things that could have happened that to cause him to trip and spill the coffee.", "[deleted]", "\ud83d\udc7d", "What if the glass breaks and and you step on a shard? I don't know if the comment you are responding to would be 99% the way they claim, but I think the poll would overwhelmingly support their claim.", "Water: can be spilled and damage other things.

One at my charity shop for \u00a39. Don't give a fuck about things being near electricals, it's an expensive cost but no harm. Glass on the floor is serious health and safety hence why we don't do it in restaurants.", "Im partial to neither myself.", "We already have info that she was asked not to do this several times.", "Is the guy over the top? Yes. I think OP should dump him. But come on. Saying \u201cJust look before you walk near/get up from this area\u201d instead of not leaving various cups and glasses on the floor is not mature behavior. If you have a glass with you and you like to set it on the floor, then sure. But pick it up when you get up and leave the room. This is basic, ground floor level tidiness", "So, just so I have this straight, the boyfriend should be looking out not to step on any glasses, but the girlfriend shouldn't have to look out and pick up after herself?", "And I disagree - OP has some culpability here too, but the relationship clearly was already doomed.", "It's not easy to break a glass, especially only knocking it over.  Have a go yourself and see how much force you need to break it.", "Seriously, how much life are people experiencing?  How many glasses shatter from being knocked over?  Like from upright on the floor to on its side on the floor?  Sure, the greater the fall the more likely for it to break: from table to floor, for example.  \n\nGo pour yourself some water into a glass, set it on the ground and see if you can break it without picking it up.", "Me. \"Objects go on tables.\"\n\nYou. \"Laptops don't go next to fluids.\"\n\nNo one said they did.", "Yes like I literally agree she\u2019s being untidy and annoying. \n\nBut there\u2019s a whole world in between that and being responsible for him falling over. \n\nNot only that but she shouldn\u2019t have to say \u201coh look out for this\u201d like it\u2019s a basic assumption that in order to move through the world you know to watch where you\u2019re going so you don\u2019t trip on things??\n\nIn a perfect world there\u2019d be no trip hazards, but we don\u2019t live in that world, we live in this one. I can\u2019t fathom being so careless that you trip and then blame the object that was in your path instead of yourself for not *paying attention.* (Caveats apply obviously in the case of a child or person with mobility issues.)", "She should work on her habits and pick up after herself to be a more pleasant housemate. \n\nIs she responsible for boyfriend falling over? No. He is for not watching where he was going. It\u2019s not specific to glasses, if you trip over something it\u2019s your own fault, that\u2019s a fact of life. Edit: this is the absolute bare basics of chain of causation. \n\nHell, OP wasn\u2019t even in the house.

That sounds ridiculous and like you are stretching to defend messy behavior from her.", "She is responsible for her boyfriend falling. If she didn\u2019t leave the glass on the ground for someone to trip over like a normal person then he wouldn\u2019t have fell, his coffee wouldn\u2019t have spilt, and the laptop wouldn\u2019t have broke", "\u2026 I did. But this is uhh how reddit works? People comment and reply to things? Oh brother.", "I have literally said multiple times that she should tidy up after herself, but she\u2019s not responsible for him falling over because she was messy. That\u2019s such a stretch and we\u2019d all be liable for everything if we applied that logic to the whole world. Boyfriend needs to take accountability for himself for being careless and tripping. \n\nAnd I guess you don\u2019t have pets or anything because I\u2019d never just swing my feet down from the sofa without checking my dog wasn\u2019t sat there. \n\nI mean I\u2019m a total neat freak to the point where I\u2019m borderline unpleasant to live with, but if I leave for work in a rush there\u2019s probably going to be something out of place during the day while I\u2019m gone, annoying as I may find it. If I walk into your house right now is everything going to be exactly where it\u2019s supposed to be? Probably not.", "Nope, boyfriend is the party responsible for tripping. Basic chain of causation; glass on floor wouldn\u2019t have lead to tripping if boyfriend wasn\u2019t careless, and laptop wouldn\u2019t have broken if he didn\u2019t put coffee next to it. \n\nIf the glass was even responsible for the breakage in the first place. Personally I find it slightly bizarre that he tripped on the glass, fell into the coffee table and the damage was that coffee got into his MacBook? I think he just spilled coffee on the laptop and thinks he can bully girlfriend into paying for it, honestly.", "Yeah and the butterfly is the reason I got in a car wreck.", "Yes she is responsible if she left the tripping hazard. This is why people can sue stores for having wet floors and them tripping over them because there is no expectation for people to avoid things that are dangerous tripping hazards. The expectation is on the person who is creating the hazard to clean it up or make sure no one is hurt because of their hazard. \n\nIf I had a habit of leaving paint buckets hanging on a string above the stair case would it be my boyfriends fault for not checking to make sure there are no buckets before walking on the stairs?", "You\u2019re calling the boyfriend careless when OP is the one who carelessly leaves behind her glasses in an area where there is frequent foot traffic??
