She does not pay or apply her kids to the daycare, she just dumps them there however we take care of them anyway, because were not just gonna let two young kids just stand alone outside with nowhere to go.\n\nNow, heres where the main event of this story happened. i was at the daycare a bit before we opened, and me and a coworker were talking about this lady who would just dump their kids here everyday, and that my coworker had found her phone number through the company she worked at (Which, you couldve guessed, has their logo on the truck she drives.) So we figured that at some point we should call her sometime to \"Educate\" her.  a few minutes later we go to open, and who couldve guessed, its the ladies kids. The kids tried to step in, and i told them to wait outside a moment. After that i decide to call the woman to put and end to this. I call her, and i tell her i work at the daycare. i explain to her how she couldnt just dump her kids at the establishment for the reasons i explained earlier. She wasnt screaming, but her voice certainly got louder, and she said \"Cant you please just do a single mom a favor, please?\" i turned her down and told her she had to come pick up her kids. after a bit of arguing, eventually she agreed. she came with the truck, and picked up the kids, and the rest of the day was normal. however, now that im home after that, i feel bad. i feel like i just made a struggling mother have an even harder time.  \nAITA?", "created_utc": 1678706089, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11q6uia/aita_for_sending_a_single_mothers_kids_back_to/", "score": 280, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sorry but just dumping the kids there every morning without paying and expecting strangers (the daycare center) to look after the children is not okay.

Would you be personally liable for it. So many things could go wrong. \nYeah it sucks she is a single mum, but they are her responsibility not yours, and to force that on strangers is just wrong. Just because you have kids does not mean you are more important.", "YTA (you all, as a business) for not nipping this the first time someone dumped ACTUAL HUMAN CHILDREN at your place of business. What would have happened in an emergency? Where does it leave you with your adult-to-child ratio?

She signed no contract, and you had no medical history or phone number to call in an emergency.

What this mother was doing is abandonment even if she intended to pick them up.\n\nWhat if she got in an accident on the way home? You wouldn't have even been able to tell anyone who's kids they are. Do you want to be charged for kidnapping?\n\nI feel for single parents, my partner was one (he has my help now).

Even if you're not required to report, morally you have an obligation to.\n\nYTA for allowing this to go on for so long", "NTA overall but you were the AH to not have put a stop to that practice the first time it happened.   That's a MASSIVE liability on the daycare's end.   Plus, she is not entitled to mooch the same services everybody else has to pay for.  There are social service programs in place to assist parents with daycare costs.  Being a single mother ain't got shit to do with it.", "NTA. Having your kids in daycare is a business transaction. The customer (parents/guardians) enter into a fixed contract where you provide care according to a fixed agreement in exchange for money. The parents agree that you can make limited decisions on their behalf and will return for their children when you call. You haven't been \"helping\" a single mother, you've been enabling her and risking everything by doing so.\n\nYou had to get this woman's number from a *courier*. You've been taking care of children *without being able to contact their parent*. You've been putting yourself, the business, and the care of every other child there in danger. \n\nShe's been *abandoning* her children. That is the *legal definition* of what has been happening. *You have an obligation to inform the police or child services*. Even if it doesn't happen again, you must report this.", "NTA - The mother should consider your actions a generous warning. She is lucky you didn\u2019t call the police/child services. A parent can not simply dump their kids at a random child care providers doorstep- that is considered child abandonment.", "NTA.  She HAS to follow the rules.  She is so entitled to think that a business should just provide day care with no fwd notice or no PAYMENT.  You were scammed for so long bc you are a soft heart and she took advantage of that to see how far she could push her luck.  Watching someone else's kids carries liabilities where I would never just do that for free.\n\nYou warn her the next time this happens, she has 10 minutes to drop what she is doing or you call the police to report abandoned children.  The police just love to hear reports about abandoned children.  Nothing impresses CPS or a judge more than negligent parents", "ESH!!!!!! What a legal mess you have all created! I hope she doesn\u2019t sue. You\u2019ve left your day care vulnerable. You\u2019ve left your job vulnerable, and you\u2019ve now left those kids vulnerable. \n\nYou call authorities the VERY FIRST DAY.

Unfortunately, you try to be nice to people and cut them slack, and they think they can continue to get away with it, and then they get mad when they're finally held accountable.  this mom should have been held accountable, and this behavior should have been addressed the 1st time it happened.", "YTA. The mom is dropping two toddlers of with no support and no guarantee that anyone will look after them. Your job is to call social services, not let this shit go on until the kids get hurt. The fact that she is a single mom is irrelevant here and the fact that you have let the kids stay several times already is unacceptable. You do not have any info on the kid, what if one of them has an allergic reaction? What if there is some other emergency and you do not have any emergency contact information? You not putting a stop to this by calling social services is actively putting the kids in harms way.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You have a duty to your employer and your own legal protection by refusing to take care of children that are not registered to your facility. It's tough being a parent, though, so I see why you would might think you're an asshole but you're just doing your job. \n\nTo the people that say \"Call the cops\" and \"child abandonment\", just stop.

I'm glad I don't have to take kids to daycare anymore. Sheesh.", "ESH.

You have a week to make alternative arrangements or we will just not admit them\"? You (the daycare centre as a business) have let this go on too long but a less abrupt way of dealing with it may have been better for all concerned, especially the kids.", "Isn't it illegal to take in children who are not registered?

No. That's just not how life works.   \n\nWould you be happy if someone left their kids at your door every day and expected you to give your time to watch them.
