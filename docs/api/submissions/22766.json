My sister works at a kids daycare and my niece is there too so essentially all day she is watching her daughter and a bunch of other kids.

When she comes home my niece runs in yelling my name  and trying to run to my room and I enjoy this. I let her in my room when she knocks and she tells me about her day. I enjoy my sister getting a break as there is literally no time when she is not away from her kid. I don't want to make her sound like a bad mom. She's a great mom and loves kids and will have lots of kids over the house every weekend and actively plays with her daughter and her friends so it's not her trying to pass her off to me.

They do it for the support as well.  Yes you are TECHNICALLY an adult.  Yes you go to college and yes you finally got a job of some sort.  But you are still living at home potentially for free. You have 1-2 days free as you've said already.  Your sister has none.  She is a full time mom and runs a daycare.  Which means even when she is done dealing with all the screaming crying kids she has to still deal with her own.  She got used to having that hour free, that hour to re center herself and just breath air.  Is that in anyway your fault? No absolutely not.  But as previously mentioned you are living at home for either free or for discount. Which means it is socially polite to help those living with you. You should absolutely focus on yourself with your Career and school. You are in no way the AH for that.  But if you are using your 1-2 days of free socializing to do nothing, and feel guilty about it which is what made you post this in the first place? Then YTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
