If I am home I am often interacting with her and she spends a lot of time in m room or with me. My sister works at a kids daycare and my niece is there too so essentially all day she is watching her daughter and a bunch of other kids. She usually gets home around 5-6 and I am usually home so I would watch my niece while my sister showers, unwinds, and gets dinner ready or has a show on or something. Usually like an hour and I don't mind it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am an adult with a life so I am not always home. When she comes home my niece runs in yelling my name  and trying to run to my room and I enjoy this. I let her in my room when she knocks and she tells me about her day. I enjoy my sister getting a break as there is literally no time when she is not away from her kid. I don't want to make her sound like a bad mom. She's a great mom and loves kids and will have lots of kids over the house every weekend and actively plays with her daughter and her friends so it's not her trying to pass her off to me. It's literally just an hour after she gets off work. When I am not home I would get a text asking if I am home and then I'd say no and she'd say \"okay.\" She wouldn't be upset but I can tell she misses her break.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecently I got a job.

She told me how she got used to me being home and watching her for that hour and asked if there is anyway I would do it again.

You were being a kind sister, and sounds like she respected and enjoyed that you gave her a break.", "NTA. \nYour sister is the mother, not you. You did something really kind to help her with your niece, and it's clear you love both of them.\nBUT, you are a 19 yrs old that is trying to live her live and planning for your future.\nIf you want to spend your free time to do other things, you have every right to do so. You watching your niece, should be done on your own free will, and not because she is family and you must do it.\n\nFor now I would also say NTA for your sister, because she didnt guilt trip you or got your parents involved to make you cave (for now). But, but if she ever starts making passive/aggressive comments about your job or your niece, to make you change your mind, then you'll have a problem.\n\nOne question: where are your parents in all this? They can't help her with the niece in that 'free hour', like you usually did?", "I can see why your sister would have come to have rely on you a little bit, but it's still not your problem.

She also has a job and is presumably not paying rent and knows a bunch of babysitters and other parents so she should be arranging babysitters, or exchanging looking after a couple friends kids for one night so they take her kid one night and she can have time off.\n\nIt's entirely not on you to be her only source of time away from her kid. NTA. She has to figure out ways to be able to have some time to herself, get out with friends, go on dates, spend time with other adults or just go read for an evening in peace.", "There's literally no conflict here.", "NAH, it's normal for her to be a bit disappointed but as long as she accepts your answer neither of you are AH.

You certainly didn\u2019t do anything wrong. And it doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s being entitled, just asked if you\u2019d be willing to have a similar situation again. For now, the answer is no. At some point, you might be willing to revisit that. As long as she doesn\u2019t have any expectations, I think it\u2019ll all be good. But, for your niece, it might be good for you and your sister to have a chat with her because she\u2019s gotten used to you being home most days, it\u2019s part of her routine, and so\nI think you should talk with her so she doesn\u2019t feel abandoned.", "NTA you have to Look after yourself. \n\nI can relate to your sister but you are Not her Sitter or Partner", "Nta. Doesnt sound like she is either. You both sound so lovely & nice. Hope you find a new routine that works for you both", "Honestly, as long as your sister isn't hounding you or trying to make you feel bad, I'd say NAH. It was a nice thing you did for her, but your situation is different now. She's not wrong for wanting some time to herself, but you're not wrong for working and having a social life. Congrats on the job, and I hope your sister can find a good solution.", "NTA. Your sister needs to find someone else to look after your niece for an hour or two. You need to focus on your life."]}
