Now the new academic year started  I already found a tutor but her request was for the session to happen at her house which I agreed. I dropped maya off and when I came to take her back her tutor showed me her bathroom saying that during the session maya asked to go do the toilet and when she came back the tutor found the toilet in a messy condition. I asked maya and she did say that she did open the bottles and spill them also only maya and the tutor were home. I was obviously embarrassed at this and apologized. The whole situation was weird and I started to connect the dots of maya's behavior being similar like how she enters her sister's room and destroys all her stuff and she did that so much despite being punished every time. Her messing with the tutor's toilet made me believe there is something clearly wrong I n her behavior because if like doing stuff with her sister could pass, doing it with the tutor can't be passed as her \"just playing\". \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI talked with my husband telling him something is obviously not right with her and we should meet with a professional but he refused saying that her behavior is normal and just like other kids and we kept arguing about it and I told him that I just can't handle her anymore either we seek professional help or he brings her a nanny but he called me a selfish person for this request.", "created_utc": 1697373563, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/178eid8/aita_for_telling_my_husband_there_is_something/", "score": 6, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Maybe try talking to her mom. Maybe she will be more receptive and see some of the same issues at her house too. Maybe her mom even struggled like this as a child or even as an adult and will understand better then dad. These is no hard in getting an evaluation done.", "NTA. A toddler opening bottles and spilling things in someone else\u2019s house is not unexpected. A nine year old doing that is unexpected. Maya\u2019s behavior is not normal and not like other kids her age. She needs a professional evaluation.\n\nYour husband is being a bad parent here.", "NTA and you are definitely not the selfish one, you care about her and actively trying to help her.  Your husband is the selfish one, he doesn't want to know that's why he keeps brushing it off.  Try and approach you husband as you are really worry about Maya - not you had enough with dealing with her.  You may get better response. \n\nShe does sounds like she is showing adhd traits,  girls are better at masking so for those who are not paying as much attention, they wouldn't think/see any issues.", "Start with just a visit to her regular doctor.   \n\nJust my personal experience but she sounds a lot like my daughter when she was diagnosed with ADHD.  Her attention was on things SHE considered important and not necessarily on task.  And the impulse control, good Lord.  There was none lol.   \n\nObviously, your stepdaughter may have another issue but ask your husband to just start with scheduling her a regular doctor's appointment.  I had to get some letters from my daughter's teachers for the official diagnosis, and perhaps you could ask them for input on SD's behavior so you are armed & ready for talking with the doctor.   \n\nNTA, with assuming you've told the girl her behavior is inappropriate", "This sounds like hyperactivity disorder. I don't like you as a stepmom making the kids seem like a monster because they dumped soap or whatever in the toilet.  But you do have a point to get her checked out.

You show real concern for the little one and your hubby is just an ignorant idiot. I'd stop being a \"mom\" and make him deal with the girl until he can clearly see for himself. You have a right to look after your personal mental wellbeing and it's not selfish. She clearly needs to be evaluated. Looks like she's not well and looking for more attention and understanding.", "Nta\nPeople should get yearly mental checkups just like physical checkups and dental checkups", "NTA. Seems to me that you are correct and her behavior needs to be addressed. Knowing what her issue is will help you know how to help her.", "ESH. Bringing in a nanny doesn\u2019t help this little girl, it just gets her out of your hair. It\u2019s not about you, your husband, the tutor, or the older sister. It\u2019s about a little girl who needs help.", "As others have said - the armchair psychologist in me also tends to call ADHD, especially the concentration problems. ADHD people can focus, but they can't control what they focus on. Between hyper-focusing and zero-focusing, there are some really strong changes. And ADHD is often underdiagnosed in girls and women, because the hyperactivity part is usually quite different from boys.\n\nI'd say basically NTA but point deduction for using terms like \"not normal\". A nanny won't help here. If she is really neurodiverse, you definitely need professional help, without treatment this can have really bad consequences later on.", "NTA\n\nThis is a tough subject but I hope you're not using terms like \"not normal\". I would attack this with removing the stigma of seeing a professional. You might find out that it's something completely different (gut problems, vision problems, anxiety). But until someone has a few sessions.... nobody will know.\n\nHe needs to understand that for a lot of kids, getting \"control\" gives confidence.", "No one made the child out to be a monster. \n\nStepmother is concerned that there is an undiagnosed issue. \n\nStepmom is in top of things with this child,  unlike her Dad.", "No kidding,  but Dad is in denial. \n\nMom is not mentioned. \n\nAnd truly, this is not stepmom's responsibility, though stepmom seems to be trying.", "It seems OP wants to get help by asking a professional but her husband is refusing."]}
