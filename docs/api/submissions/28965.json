All those special ed teachers, all that therapy, and no one suggested she get diagnosed. Apparently autism and ADD or ADHD are very common together. Anyway, I realized I had ADD while helping her get diagnosed--it was during the pandemic, so a lot of the evaluations were online testing and Zoom calls, so I was there for all of it. I'm also dyslexic, with an uncommon type, but no one noticed that one either until I figured it out myself as a graduate student.
