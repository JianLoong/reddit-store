All those special ed teachers, all that therapy, and no one suggested she get diagnosed. Apparently autism and ADD or ADHD are very common together.

Sometimes it feels like a superpower.\n\nI'm terrible at doing paperwork. Back when I worked in emergency medicine one year for Christmas everyone got coffee mugs with their superhero name on them.

I could be in the middle of assessing one patient and a nurse could just interrupt me long enough to show me test results on another and they wouldn't need to fill me in on that patient's details, I could just give them instructions or come by that patient's bed next with no delays.\n\nBecause ADHD means having an interest-based nervous system and I find all of that stuff interesting.\n\nHowever, I was terrible at doing paperwork. *Terrible*. Possibly the greatest compliment I got in that time was a senior nurse telling me that I was actually worth it when the nurses sometimes had someone stand over me to keep me company while I did the parts they couldn't do for me and remind me to get back on task when I got distracted.\n\n(For a certain value of working, this generally does work.)\n\nI had to leave emergency medicine after an accident left me physically unable to keep up with it.

Had I been even slightly more impulsive and less (accidentally) accommodated, I most definitely might've had the impulse to destroy stuff out of frustration, not feeling listened to, feeling dismissed, etc, and acted on it due to the lack of impulse control. In fact, it wasn't all that uncommon for me to feel like destroying stuff as an undiagnosed child due to frustration of not being understood but for me, my impulse control held for the most part.\n\nADHD is not just inattention and hyperactivity. It's difficulty regulating focus, thoughts, impulses and very often emotions. ADHD often causes a lot of those to be very black and white especially when untreated. Either you hyperfocus or can't focus at all, your thoughts run all the time and you have no control, you either do things impulsively or are extremely indecisive, you are either happy or you're not, you either feel a lot, a lot, or really not much at all, you either shut down from emotions or they implode out of you.\n\nI'm not saying she definitely has ADHD, I don't know her, but I did need to say this because too often people understand the surface of ADHD but don't realize how deep it goes and what apparently unrelated issues may be caused by it.", "Same.

Children often don't have enough understanding to appreciate that just because someone is describing their behaviour as \"not normal\" doesn't mean that they automatically think of the whole child as being not normal. It can have deep and lasting damaging impact to believe that people (especially family) see you that way.
