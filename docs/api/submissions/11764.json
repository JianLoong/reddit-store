It was a big celebration with all of our family and friends in attendance, and we were thrilled to have everyone there to share our special day with us.\n\nAfter the wedding, my mother-in-law gifted us a set of knives that were made with high-quality materials and had a beautiful design. However, upon closer inspection, I noticed that the handles were made with animal bone, which goes against my vegan beliefs. I thanked her for the gift, but explained that I couldn't accept it because it would compromise my values.\n\nMy mother-in-law was really offended and upset. She accused me of being ungrateful and disrespectful, and said that I was trying to force my beliefs on her. My husband and I tried to explain our reasoning, but she wouldn't listen and stormed out of our house.\n\nNow my husband's family is angry with me and my husband is caught in the middle. I feel like I did the right thing by sticking to my beliefs, but my mother-in-law and his family think that I'm being difficult and rude. Am I the asshole for not accepting the knives?\n\nI'm struggling with this situation because I don't want to cause any drama or hurt anyone's feelings, but at the same time, I don't want to compromise my values. I feel like my mother-in-law should have taken my beliefs into consideration before giving us the knives, but she seems to think that it's not a big deal.\n\nI'm not sure how to handle this situation moving forward, but I don't want it to cause any long-term tension or resentment between myself and my husband's family. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: my MIL knows i am a vegan, and i am against animal products.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit #2: i have previously had a good relationship with my MIL. i didn't expect her to react the way i did when i refused the gift.

What is your relationship like with your MIL, aside from this incident? Is there any chance that she did this intentionally, knowing that it conflicts with your beliefs/lifestyle?\n\nI don\u2019t want to sow any discord for you, OP (though it sounds like you have it already) there\u2019s also a very good possibility that it completely slipped her mind/didn\u2019t even occur to her that the tableware could be contain animal byproducts. \n\nThat being said, I doubt that this would be an item/set that you could exchange quietly (without her noticing,) and you\u2019d have to live with her being upset that you don\u2019t use it if you were to keep it, and/or have to eat your vegan food with cutlery made with animal bones. \n\nIt\u2019s kind of a lose-lose for you, OP. The only option you have to make everyone happy seems to be to forfeit your beliefs, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an acceptable expectation for your in laws to have, even if they purchased the gift with good intentions.", "NTA. In most circumstances you could politely accept and quietly return the gift later, but a custom knife set like that is meant to be displayed. No hiding that you got rid of that, and if I were your in laws I\u2019d be grateful for the chance to get you something you\u2019d love instead.\n\nHow on earth is you not wanting YOUR knife set to be made from animal parts you forcing your beliefs on her?", "You\u2019re NTA, it was an inconsiderate gift. Good job for standing up for yourself. I wonder if this is the first time MIL has done something like this or if this is normal behavior.", ">She accused me of being ungrateful and disrespectful, and *said that I was trying to force my beliefs on her.*\n\nIt strikes me that it's the other way around. You're not forcing anything.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. I think you handled it well. As long as you & hubby are in agreement, the 2 of you will be okay & that's the most important thing. Considering what he understand of his mum's personality, wait for her to cool off (or maybe she would see that as disrespectful?); approach her and make a nice gesture - take her out or send her flowers - whatever! Be cordial, as warm as possible. Thank her for welcoming you into the family, or raising such a wonderful man, whatever is true. When you do have a conversation don't bring up the incident but if she does, maintain exactly the same line: \"I'm so sorry that you felt disrespected as I that was not my intention. I'm so grateful that we are able to move past it.\" And change the subject. Good luck OP.", "NTA. When you give a gift, you should not be forcing YOUR beliefs on the recipient. If they knew you were vegan and didn't buy products that contain animal parts, then your MIL disrespected YOU by giving you an inappropriate gift. She's minimizing your feelings because she knows she made an inconsiderate choice.  \n\n\nIt sounds like you tried to be polite about returning it, instead of accepting it and getting rid of them, and then have them ask you where those \"lovely knives are.\" \n\nThis is the point where you make it clear that this is a boundary, and it doesn't matter whether she thinks it is not a big deal. You're a vegan, these are your values, and you won't accept items into your home made from animals. Is she going to give her potential future grandbaby leather shoes? Give you a leather purse as a holiday or birthday gift?", "NTA\n She knew that you wouldn\u2019t want anything made from animals and she went and got you a gift that went against your beliefs. You didn\u2019t force anything on her, if anything she is forcing hers on you by disregarding your vegan life and saying dead animals aren\u2019t a big deal when for you they are. She is the one being disrespectful and out of line. Stand by your values and if they can\u2019t accept it, then maybe keeping your distance is better. They obviously don\u2019t respect you.", "NTA. You are not forcing your beliefs on your MIL by not wanting this gift. By insisting that you take the gift, she is forcing her beliefs on you. And, by taking offense, she is the one causing the drama.", "NTA: she knows your beliefs and it\u2019s not hard to understand not to give a vegan any animal products", "Nta but I would remind her that you're really touched with her thinking of you. Maybe she could use that beautiful set herself and you could consider it your first birthday gift to her since she's got remarkable tastes.", "NTA", "NTA. \n\nIf I got someone a gift and they truly weren\u2019t able to use it - as is the case for you - I\u2019d want to know so I could return it and get something they\u2019d like/be able to use.\n\nShe either didn\u2019t realize the knives were made of animal bone, in which case you guys could go together to return the gift and pick out something else. Or she did realize, and tried to make a point that she thinks your beliefs are silly.", "INFO: Does your MIL fully understand your vegan beliefs? I've got to admit, I don't fully understand vegan beliefs. If an animal is already dead, is it better to discard the bones rather than use all parts of the animal as Native Americans did?", "You're NTA. If she didn't realize the handles were made of bone, I would have said N-A-H,  but that would have required some maturity from her and accepting that she made a mistake by giving you something that goes against your beliefs. Her tantrum and involving other family members makes it seem like it was deliberate. \n\nNot trying to be sarcastic here, but does a vegan even need a set of high quality kitchen knives? Isn't most of your acceptable food somewhat easy to cut?", "INFO: Did your MIL know that you use no animal products?  Are you consistent about this, ie no leather / silk / beeswax?", "Info, did you give your husband a chance to decide if he wanted to give back the knives? They were also a gift to him.", "NTA, but only just\n\nIf MIL knew that you're vegan, it was a pass-ag gift designed to set you up or to give upu the middle finger.  She shouldn't have done it, but you could've been more on the DL with your reaction.  If she didn't know, I would maybe give her a pass...\n\nIt's an old wives' tale type custom to never give knives or scissors for a wedding or anniversary gift.  Sharp-edged instruments were once considered bad gifts since they could symbolize the severing the relationship being celebrated.", "YTA\n\nNot for sticking to your values. That's fine. But, when this is someone so close to you two, I think it would have been better to accept the gift and perhaps once you're home, reach out: \"Oh, my friend Annie already gifted us the knife set from our registry and we don't need two, would you like this one back?\"\n\nNow, I'm not saying to hide your beliefs moving forward whatsoever. You can, after all, only make so many excuses. I think people who are not vegans may not think to look for things such as bone/antler handles because it's not, you know, being eaten. So that could have been an oversight on her part and when things like that are pointed out, it can sometimes embarrass people into reacting badly. So at a further date, it'll be important that your MIL understand what veganism is to you and if you're all able to communicate well, it should curb future awkward gift exchanges.", "YTA.   Accept the gift.  Then exchange it, donate it, stick it in your basement, lose it, whatever.", "Soft YTA. Two questions. Is this how you wanted to begin your relationship with them as in-laws? Also, is this the hill you want to die on before the relationships develop? I respect your beliefs, but I think you handled this all wrong. If you feel that strongly about it, you should have specified that you didn't want gifts containing any animal parts and provided specific definitions for what that means. Most people are not going to know what is on that list. Since you didn't notify everyone in advance, you should have accepted them, said thank you, and then put them in a box in the back of your attic, so you never saw them again. I say apologize to smooth it over and be more specific at the next event that includes gifts. Good luck. :-)", "INFO: Is your husband also vegan?", "YTA. How hard would it be to stick them in a drawer?", "INFO: does MIL know you are vegan and how seriously take it/that it applies to all areas of your life? Does your husband live the same way you do?\n\nIf your husband and you both live like this and MIL knows, then she's TA for this. If she didn't know. But if your husband doesn't live like you do as far as veganism (and especially if your MIL didn't know about your beliefs), you're TA, at least a little bit. Because if your husband is using animal products and bringing them into your home anyway, why couldn't you have just accepted it and thanked her and let it be something for your husband to use? He could kindly explain your veganism to her later on so that this sort of thing doesn't happen again. \n\nEither way though, it sounds like your husband supported you on this, so maybe you should have let him be the one to gently take the issue up with her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Did she go out of her way to find these? \n\nNTA. You were polite in refusing the gift, and she is probably embarrassed that she didn\u2019t realize that as a vegan, you probably wouldn\u2019t appreciate a gift made with animal products.", "NTA And this shouldn\u2019t be your battle to fight.

Who\u2019s trying to force their beliefs on who??\nEdited: NTA!", "i am not going to force my beliefs on you, but my MIL 100% understands my beliefs.", "I'm not a vegan, and vegans would say I'm hypocritical for being against animal cruelty in other instances but not in eating them, but I don't care. I've got no problem with eating animals because it's natural. Using their body parts in unnecessary ways or to make things where they're not needed is not natural. I still can't believe anyone would wear fur or carry a purse made from ostrich or crocodile these days -- there are many people whose stomachs turn at the thought of such things despite having no problem eating meat.\n\nThe practice of using every part of the animal was logical for people who lived in harmony with nature, but the modern world clearly isn't trying to do that. Making knives with animal bone is not done to be less wasteful. It's just gratuitously cruel -- in no circumstances do knives made with modern manufacturing need to include body parts of dead animals.\n\nNeedless to say, such practices are even more stomach-turning for vegans. Vegans deserve to have their beliefs respected. OP could say she's a follower of the Flying Spaghetti Monster so only colanders made of a certain material are allowed in her house, and people would have to respect it. Maybe it didn't occur to MIL that veganism is about not using any animal products, not just not eating them, but upon being informed, someone who loves or care about or respects the recipient would say \"Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know\" and exchange the gift for something else, not demand the recipient compromise their beliefs.\n\nNTA", "\n>I don't fully understand vegan beliefs. If an animal is already dead, is it better to discard the bones rather than use all parts of the animal as Native Americans did?\n\nIt's not about the animal that's already dead.

Some people don't really understand what veganism is. Some are under the impression that it concerns people's diets, and don't stop to think that it includes using other animal products. MIL might have made sure to serve OP vegan food at a family meal, for example, but not considered that giving her items made with animal products were also taboo. It would have been a good idea to explain to all guests what types of items were not appropriate.", "When you allow someone to step over your boundaries, they will do it again.

In any case, she gave you an offensive gift, you were gracious in declining it, and she was rude in return.", "Does she typically respect your veganism, or has she been pushy about it?", "Lying is never a good idea. Besides if she's upset about you being unable to accept the gift, I highly doubt any reason for doing so or that you never using them would be acceptable to her.", "I would not listen to that person's comment. If she did it by mistake she would have apologized. The way she reacted makes me think she did it on purpose. And even if she didn't, and it was an oversight, she's doubling down in a bad way and is out of line. You were right to hold to your boundaries.\n\nAlso, your husband is not stuck in the middle. His mom isn't acting right and you both are a team dealing with it. You should not have to acquiesce and go against your beliefs to make his life easier while his mom is throwing a tantrum.", "NAH. I think, honesty is still the right path here. I bet these knives were quite expensive and MIL would figure out the truth if you'd get rid of them. I got a knife from my mother that both of us expect to last forever.\n\nYou had a good relationship with her and you will have one in the future. She might feel hurt right now and you might have to apologize (although I think there is no reason, but people like to hear it), but it is nothing that time can't heal. \n\nWrite her, tell her, that you have no problem with their lifestyle, but ask her to please also accept yours. Tell her, that you absolutely appreciate the gift, but it's just not yours. Tell her that you love her and that you are glad to have such a great MIL and that you just wanted to be honest because of your close relationship. (just a little bit nicer).", "I don't disagree, but her timing was wrong. Doing it after someone has given you a gift feels like a slap in the face to the other person. The time to do it was in the invitation or after the wedding festivities were over."]}
