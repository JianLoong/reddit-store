She told me that she began catching feelings for me and wanted to sleep with me, and I said yes.\n\nNext morning Jennifer confessed to lying to me. She was feeling terrible after a guy she was seeing for the past few weeks ditched her. So I was kinda a rebound. That hurt like hell.

Said that she's been spending even more time than she used to at the boxing gym and shooting range, which are her two favourite hobbies and stress-relief methods. Told me it's my fault for not talking to her and that he's spending a lot of money on her right now because she's stressed out.\n\nI told him that she's his problem.

Being dismissive is the right thing if someone wants to gaslight you into taking responsibility for something thats not your business at all.\nAlso you have to decide, if you want to talk to her anymore or not.

He doesn't have to spend his money on her. He can say no. Delete and block the lot of them. Your sister needs to learn to mind her own business too!", "NTA. You don\u2019t have to be sympathetic to a person who callously used you, particularly when they were a close friend.", "NAH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHer father is fine to be concerened and try. But YOU are fione to set a boundary and refuse to see her.", "NTA Daddy doesn't have to pay for her hobbies if he doesn't want to, so it really is his problem he can't say no to his manipulative baby girl. Tell your sister daddy seemed more concerned with the money spent than his kid or her behavior.", "YTA \n\nBut not for how you treated her. You just could've been nicer to her Dad. \nParents worry but have blinkers on, he wouldn't have even thought of you(without meaning he's the AH for not). He was just worried for his daughter. \nYou could've explained why what she did hurt you so much and why it wasn't a good idea that you try to support her now.", "I would also be leery of getting involved in a highly charged emotional situation where one party is both a skilled boxer and has access to firearms.  Just sayin'.", "I agree with this comment. It would have been one thing if the father reached out to you trying to get a better understanding on the situation or work with you to help her. The friend in question could also recognize how they fucked up and truly apologize to you for their mistake\u2026\n\nYou\u2019re NTA in this situation. If this friendship is still worth something to you, I would recommend conveying your hurt feelings to your friend if you haven\u2019t already and see what they do.", "Or have another bout of stress- &/or hurt-feelings-relieving sex? \n\nSomehow, I don't think the dad knows the real reason why OP is no longer talking to his daughter.

She might be looking for a new baby daddy if the real one ditched her.", "So your take is we're supposed to feel sorry for Jennifer for lying to and using her best friend and somehow that makes OP equally an AH? Really not understanding your logic...", "She chose to use her friend, who she knew had feelings for her, to make herself feel better. I would dump my bff in a heartbeat if they pulled a stunt like this.", "Boxing gym, so extra sessions with a trainer."]}
