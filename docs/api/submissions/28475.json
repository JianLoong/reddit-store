Though how does a gym cost more than a monthly charge?\n\nDad needs to deal with his kid. Block his and her numbers.", "NTA at all. She used you. Period!! Not cool. He doesn't have to spend his money on her. He can say no. Delete and block the lot of them. Your sister needs to learn to mind her own business too!", "NTA. You don\u2019t have to be sympathetic to a person who callously used you, particularly when they were a close friend.", "NAH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHer father is fine to be concerened and try. But YOU are fione to set a boundary and refuse to see her.", "NTA Daddy doesn't have to pay for her hobbies if he doesn't want to, so it really is his problem he can't say no to his manipulative baby girl. Tell your sister daddy seemed more concerned with the money spent than his kid or her behavior.", "YTA \n\nBut not for how you treated her. You just could've been nicer to her Dad. \nParents worry but have blinkers on, he wouldn't have even thought of you(without meaning he's the AH for not). He was just worried for his daughter. \nYou could've explained why what she did hurt you so much and why it wasn't a good idea that you try to support her now.", "I would also be leery of getting involved in a highly charged emotional situation where one party is both a skilled boxer and has access to firearms.  Just sayin'.", "I agree with this comment. It would have been one thing if the father reached out to you trying to get a better understanding on the situation or work with you to help her. The friend in question could also recognize how they fucked up and truly apologize to you for their mistake\u2026\n\nYou\u2019re NTA in this situation.

She might be looking for a new baby daddy if the real one ditched her.", "So your take is we're supposed to feel sorry for Jennifer for lying to and using her best friend and somehow that makes OP equally an AH?

Her dad isn't your problem because she's not your problem. \n\n>Told me it's my fault for not talking to her and that he's spending a lot of money on her right now because she's stressed out.\n\nYeah? Because of her own actions.", "NTA, its not your responsability to help someone who used you and now you want far feom yoir life. Perhaps the father isn't an ah neither, if he doesn't know why op left. But who surely is an ah is Jennifer", "NTA.  He is her FATHER, of freaking course she is HIS problem/responsibility. And how is her spending more time with her hobbies on op? Could it not be over the guy that she talked about after sleeping with op to start with? Sister needs to stfu and mind her business.", "this sounds like directly stolen from a romcom. NTA if that really happend.", "NTA. You cutting her off was a perfectly reasonable response to her behavior. Her dad was also N T A, since it is ***highly*** doubtful he knows the whole story, so he probably thought that whatever happened between the two of you wasn't as serious as it truly was and that you might be able to help him/her. Your sister however is definitely an asshole, assuming that she knows the history.", "Bruh if your regret having sex then she raped you. NTA bruh.", "NTA- Ohhhhhhhhhhh teenaged girls and the drama they create. I could smell too much Jean Paul Gaultier and cricket pads just reading that. The horror. I would not be that age again for all the money in the world AND the ability to fly. The absolute correct thing to do was to walk away and not go any deeper down the rabbit hole. It's not like you could explain the whole circumstances to her dad so your only option was a cold and certain 'it's not happening'.", "NTA - I'm failing to see how his daughter being a shit person by using your feelings for a rebound makes this your problem? What a joke. Tell him to tell his daughter to get a job so she can pay for that shit herself or ya know.... he could just NOT give her money.", "You are not responsible for someone else's issues.\n\nHer dad is the asshole.\n\nYou are NTA", "Was the father call8ng you because he was concerned with your feelings and you being hurt by her daughter? Doesn't look like it. So what you told him was the perfect answer.", "Nta. You were her toy. At least you saved the father the expense of one more toy.", "Nta at all.", "Nta the only thing her dad is concerned about is his wallet. He doesn't care that his daughter hurt you and used you.\n\nYour sister is ridiculous and needs to mind her business. If anything she should be sympathetic toward your feelings on how she lied to you and used and hurt you.", "You can be more sympathetic, but you are 100% right in that she is nothing to do with you anymore. Daughter is her own problem once she turned 18.", "NTA\nYou should correct your sister if it comes up again: you were being dismissive of a father\u2019s concern FOR HIS MONEY. He was complaining about having to spend more money on her because if she was hanging with you my guess is that you would pay for things? \n\nI apologize if I\u2019m making assumptions/I\u2019m projecting. My sib has this issue\u2026his \u201cbff\u201d uses him to pay for everything when they \u201chang out.\u201d He doesn\u2019t see it that way so ummm yeah\u2026it\u2019s an ongoing problem. \n\nIt honestly sounds like less of her is better for you. And dad should not be reprimanding you because he has to spend money!!!", "NTA\n\nShe IS his problem...", "NTA", "NTA but what a mess. Her dad definitely has a right to be concerned about her. It sucks she was dumped and it sucks she used you for intimacy to get over him but that's something many teenagers and young adults do.

I'm really sorry she used your feelings against you just for sex. That's disgusting and you deserve better. 100% not the ahole and good for you for cutting someone that toxic out of your life.", "Your sister needs to learn to mind her own business too!", "Tell your sister daddy seemed more concerned with the money spent than his kid or her behavior.", " I just want to remind you that good friends are rare and worth fighting for and that sometimes includes fights against your own bad feelings.", "Her father kinda address it wrong as well. Hurt his wallet as if op supposed to cover the expense.", "Exactly. This reads like a bad Hallmark movie.", "Because they see it in movies and monkey see, monkey do.", "To his defense, my husband talks to himself so much that I have stopped listening if I don't hear my name. Legit mubbling to himself when his doing shits around the house. \"Helps him focus\". Kinda annoying, but armless.\n\nNow... did I cringe when I read what OP wrote? Yes. Do I think it's real? Don't really care. Enjoy the teenage drama.", "A good friend wouldn't have treated OP the way Jennifer did.\n\nWhat is this comment yo?", "I mean, he already decided didnt he? He stopped talking to her. And I wouldnt really call someone who knowingly uses your feelings to get sex for a night a 'good friend'. That's a horrible way to treat someone and in no way should he 'fight against bad feelings' to forgive her. That's shit advice.", "Maybe poor Jennifer shouldn't have slept with her best friend as a rebound knowing OP had feelings for her?\n\nOr I know. She should not have explicitly told OP that he was just a rebound and ruin their friendship all on her own. Just a few more thoughts than what you put into your comment.", "OP didn't want to be friends with a lying manipulative AH who uses him because she felt bad some other guy dumped her. Actions have consequences, if she wants to be a shitty person towards OP and play with his feelings like they mean nothing just so she can feel less bad about her breakup then she has to face the consequences that people don't want to stay in contact with a toxic person.", "I suspect OP telling her dad that he was used for sex/validation by Jennifer would change...absolutely nothing. You're just as \"helpful\" as OP's sister; why are you more concerned with being polite than OP being used and discarded as if he wasn't a human being?", ">I just want to remind you that good friends are rare and worth fighting for and that sometimes includes fights against your own bad feelings.\n\nGood friends don't use people.", ">good friends are rare\n\nyou are right they are, and she isn't one. I wonder which part of the op's story made her look like a \"good friend\"?", "I get that but it reads a lot more as creepy standing over your feverish friend and professing your love", "Well that\u2019s your decision and that\u2019s ok. I don\u2019t know how I would feel because I haven\u2019t been in that situation. So I didn\u2019t make a judgement but gave OP my honest perspective. OP doesn\u2019t need to be reminded of his feelings though so I only added the part that might be overlooked. He can and should do whatever he wants. If he wants to try to forgive her, that\u2019s ok. And if he doesn\u2019t want to do anything with her and block her and her father, that\u2019s also ok.", "Absolutely, Jennifer behaved badly. I don\u2019t deny that.  But I also think OP didn\u2019t ask any questions a good friend would have thought about and asked have when she turned up at his house.", "Oh, it does sound like that, tho. You're totally right ahah", "Eh it doesn't really read like that though. Sounds like he was bringing in some groceries and muttered it to himself. If he didn't know she was conscious he obviously wasn't standing over her lol", ">one day she turned up at my place saying she wanted to hook up. She told me that she began catching feelings for me and wanted to sleep with me, and I said yes.\n\n>Next morning Jennifer confessed to lying to me.

Some people do that a lot even if others find it weird", "Call me crazy I feel like saying your in love with someone who doesn't know it is something you'd avoid if you were in their presence"]}
