Believe me I know that\u2019s easier said than done but if that\u2019s bad you gotta push. She should bring the smell up to a doctor and that changing it every hour isn\u2019t enough. She needs help.

Also, as others have shared sweet smell is a sign of extremely dangerous and life threatening ketoacidosis. When I was diagnosed with T1D, I had a sweet acetone smell on my breath for a week, and my blood sugar was 800. This sweet smell is not something that is just there without ketones or something else medically wrong. I recommend getting ketone urine strips or blood meter from the store, and if ketones are high and won\u2019t come down then call a doctor or go to the hospital. \n\nSpeaking as a T1D woman, Type 1 Diabetes is way harder to manage than most people know. Most people who are diagnosed do not get proper support for what is a huge lifestyle change. I remember 6 months after I was diagnosed at 14, I was having a really rough day with my diabetes and my mom made a comment that it had been 6 months so I should be over it. But it\u2019s not a one time event, it\u2019s the rest of your life. And since it\u2019s all day every day, it\u2019s a constant drain on your energy to keep up with it. I can\u2019t overstate enough how far beyond it goes than just checking your blood sugar and giving a few insulin shots each day. T1Ds are far more likely to experience depression than someone without, and experience diabetic burnout. \n\nThe burnout can spiral into longer depressions because out of control blood sugars lead to poor health and mood changes. T1Ds are also far more likely to have other autoimmune diseases and thyroid issues. Being on your period can also impact your blood sugars. \n\nIt is extremely complicated to manage, way more than most people realize.

Now with the rise in virtual care, it may be easier to shop around online within your state so she can find a provider who might be far by driving distance but easy to see online. I would also advise to not give up on the first, second, third doctors visit that is inconclusive. If you have a chronic illness you have to be pushy and be an advocate for yourself, and find doctors who will advocate for you. \n\nI would also recommend type 1 diabetic support groups as there are probably many others who have experienced this same thing she is going through.

She will *never* get better and she has to live with the weight of that and the hardship and manually taking care of something your body handles on its own every day. She desperately needs to talk to someone about her mental health on top of taking care of her diabetes.

That sounds like her diabetes are causing some sort of complication with that. Like... very, very bad. The solution isn't changing her pads more often. You need to, for lack of better wording, force her to see and follow through with a doctor. I know it can be exhausting for her, but this sounds bad enough to have potential to be life-threatening serious. (If it helps drive home to her, remind her that if she thinks being a diabetic is expensive, if she ends up hospitalized with diabetes related complications TOO is going to give her a heart attack. Minimize costs by addressing it now, before she goes septic. Not a doctor here, not diagnosing, sepsis is always a fear I have with things like that) I wish I had better advice to making her seek and get the right treatment here. I just hope you get how serious this might be and that it goes beyond just hormones. Good luck to you both.", "You need to have a serious talk with her about her health. You can\u2019t assume doctors are automatically good. I developed a permanent movement disorder from a medication one gave me, and this was right after I called and said I was having issues with it and was told to keep taking it. I have a permanent disability now. My sisters coworker was in freaking *kidney failure* and the doctors never called her or talked to her about her labs, or told her she needed to go to the ER. She didn\u2019t find out until *months* after her kidneys were shutting down. I don\u2019t even want to think about the permanent damage that did to her.  Doctors are not infallible, and some are downright horrible. She has some major health issues, and she will need your support to find decent doctors who will actually treat her. I have a feeling her health issues are messing with her cognitive processes, and also probably making her anemic and exhausted, and she will likely need extra support to get to the doctors. I know it\u2019s frustrating for you, but she may need you to make doctors appointments for her (still talk to her about it, but she may not be all there to do it herself) and keep on her to get her to go see different doctors.  \n\n\nI\u2019d strongly encourage you to go to the emergency room with her, or at least an urgent care center. Her smelling sweet is incredibly worrying. That\u2019s one of those signs of DKA we\u2019re taught to look for in patients. DKA is deadly, and she really needs to be seeing someone yesterday for that symptom alone.", "Your beliefs and your feelings on what a doctor will or won't do aren't what's important. If they don't listen and you know something is wrong (hundreds of comments are telling you something is wrong) then go to a different doctor. You've tried nothing and have already given up. If you can't deal then maybe you should leave.", "It took me way too long to find this info, lmao. From OPs post I assumed the GF was changing pads every couple of days or something. Less frequently than half an hour and OP deems that \u201cnot taking care of herself\u201d??\n\nLike, I\u2019ve had times where my flow became a torrent and I had to change pads every 20 minutes for a few hours. I\u2019ve also had times where it\u2019s been so slow that I\u2019ve not needed to change it more than once/twice a day (and mainly for general hygiene and discharge, not so much for period blood). \n\nIf OPs gf is bleeding through a pad every half hour then they have bigger problems than period smell. And if she\u2019s not? Then OP needs to chill.", "I thank the universe every single day I found my APRN. She\u2019s who diagnosed me with PCOS and brought it up before I did. \n\nAnd when I said I was worried about the pill because I get migraines with aura and that\u2019s already a stroke risk, she said no problem let\u2019s try spironolactone. \n\nAnd she focuses on the PCOS associated insulin resistance. Not my weight. \u201cHere are lifestyle recommendations to manage the insulin resistance\u201d NOT \u201cwell go lose weight and then I\u2019ll consider talking about your PCOS symptoms\u201d \n\nI love her. If she ever moves I\u2019ll cry.", "Just chiming in here to try to help clarify things on this subject that the general public might not know/misunderstand as I believe this is something that should definitely be more transparent!\n\nUnfortunately, like most things in medicine, treatments are often only offered for things a patient complains about (not always but a general rule of thumb). The kicker here is if you\u2019ve had irregular periods your entire life you might not realize that it\u2019s something you CAN/SHOULD complain about. There are many things in healthcare that, if it doesn\u2019t bother you, then it\u2019s okay to live with it the way it is. \n\nMore unfortunately, womens health has historically been swept under the rug and taboo to speak up about in detail; thus, another reason many women don\u2019t feel the need to bring up issues with their period until they have issues trying to conceive is because  society has trained us that its 'gross' and something we dont talk about. Women dont want to be accused of being \u201coverly dramatic\u201d or \"weak\" by complaining (about a totally valid health concern) because \u201cas women we can handle what men can\u2019t emotionally\u201d or whatever\u2026\n\nWhat I will say is, if you are not trying to conceive, the first line treatment for PCOS really is the pill (OCPs) +/- metformin (its not fully understood but it is believed that there is a connection between diabetes and pcos) and maintaining a healthy weight, all of which help balance your hormones. The pill can be a great medication for more than just preventing pregnancy and I wish we could communicate that to our patients more effectively so they feel heard rather than dismissed like you probably did! Once you are trying to conceive the syndrome is then addressed differently in order to promote ovulation.", "My PCOS was investigated when I lacked periods for 2 yrs. I wasnt trying to conceive. I was 20 at the time. I got told I needed my monthly period for calcium absorption. I took BC to regulate my period.", "For like 6 months my periods are 12-14 days long, and then the next cycle starts 14 days later. I get anemic, and fatigued and cold, and I don't fully recover between cycles. My doc is worried about fibroids or some other physical reason, so I get to have an internal ultrasound next week (fingers crossed it isn't cancer). \n\n\nBut my gyno thinks it might just be the minipill screwing with me. She took me off combo pill because of my migrains, and I'm not thrilled about its lower effectiveness. I also learned that if your cycle is irregular, the pill might not be as effective, same for women 40+, which I also am, so basically this fucking pill could be wrecking me while being totally worthless.\n\nSorry. End vent.\n\nMy point is that it isn't normal, and there could be a cause that can be corrected. Good luck.", "Laughs in 3 month period.", "I'm 42 and starting having completely whacked periods and other hormone issues. I keep wishing it would go faster as menopause lol", "I had periods like that and the birth control is finally working, but oh man there was a good five to six months where I just was bleeding all the time. And every time I called and asked I was told it was normal. Absolutely frustrating. Like I\u2019m getting this shot to stop the constant periods and now I have a nonstop period????\n\nAnyways, the doctors were right, at the six month mark they finally stopped and then came back randomly and for ten plus days. The nine month mark is when they finally stopped and now I get super light, no cramp periods. It\u2019s absolutely wonderful.", "Yep!!! See an actual gynaecologist someone who actually specialises in reproductive situations", "Yes, it does if the blood sugar is high enough and untreated for long enough. It was a powerful indicator for a diabetes diagnosis back in the day. Still, these days most people are caught earlier as they're more aware, and doctors start looking for earlier symptoms and testing more regularly. \n\nUnfortunately, this is a case of medical neglect where the doctors/OP's GF/OP haven't done their due diligence, so it's been allowed to get so severe that it's impacting her in ways that aren't often seen in modern times (outside of when folks first get diagnosed and haven't brought their symptoms under control yet). \n\nThe OP mentioned that the GF is a T1. In my country, the medical response is early interventions and strict monitoring, dieticians, regular nurse checks, as well as diabetes education and a national registry. They take it very seriously (I have diabetes following a pancreatic injury and have some experience). It's pretty rare to see such poorly managed diabetes outside of patients who ignore medical doctors and have risk-taking lifestyle choices that impact their health.", "oh man that sounds nice! my former gyno was nice too (need to go back -_-;;) but it\u2019s such a nice thing to find a provider who won\u2019t focus on weight especially when you are already overweight. I have PCOS too and the one thing too is like it can cause insulin resistance and weight gain but it also make it tricky to shed weight off too so it\u2019s a never ending cycle. I wish all providers would learn to shed their internal fatphobia when providing care!\n\nalso i never tried to and probably will never have a kid, i had to go to my gyno and be like \u201ci have all these symptoms of PCOS so can we check that?\u201d and luckily she did and i had a large cyst on an ovary we got surgically removed luckily.", "> you might not realize it's something you CAN/SHOULD complain about\n\nI fully second this. I had horrid periods from age 12 onward - passing out, cramps so bad I vomited, etc. My periods would only come 3-4 times a year and I absolutely thought it was normal because my NP acted like it was normal and I was just whining. Then, I got bronchitis at 16 and the pediatrician on duty that day asked me when my last period was so I could get a lung x-ray. When I said over six months ago, he asked me a bunch of follow up questions and said \"yeah, that's not normal. I'm writing you a referral to a specialist\". If that doctor had never asked me, I'd have suffered for God knows how many years.", "Laughs in 2 year period that ended in the ICU.", "I'll raise you a year and a half, culminating in an absolute massacre on my office chair the day we were packing up for first Covid lockdown.", "Titters in 9 month period that only ended because of the hysterectomy.", "Oh I know I haven't because me have brain.....if he had half of one he could google reasons behind what's going on and bring it to his partner showing EVIDENCE that something serious is going on. \n\nCan't force but you can discuss and give valid arguments to why she should be going but you have to care to go that far.", "GF is the asshole for not doing anything to manage her condition. \n\nYou're diagnosing the GF with depression which also is not a OP's problem to solve, just as her diabetes or whatever she has is not the OP's problem to solve. The GF is a fully grown adult who is not taking  care of herself.  \n\nTalk about infantalizing a woman and passing the buck onto someone else.", "I'm not convinced, which is why I said \"if.\" *If* her diabetes is so out of control that...etc. The sweet smell is raising alarm bells for type 1 diabetics in the comments because it could mean she has a LOT of excess sugar in her bloodstream, and that can lead to potentially fatal diabetic ketoacidosis. People are trying to caution OP about the possibility of a potentially deadly emergency here. \n\nCould something else cause the smell? Sure, maybe. But OP and GF deserve to know about the fatal possibilities here.\n\nI never said the bleeding wasn't a problem. I'm simply objecting to your statement that she doesn't need to see a diabetes specialist. It's dangerous advice, and if you don't understand why, then you may need to take a few minutes to read about type 1 diabetes. OP said GF doesn't take good care of herself, and a type 1 diabetic not taking care of their disease could end up dead, very quickly.  Type 1 diabetes is not type 2 diabetes. Treating type 1 diabetes is not as simple as taking a pill and laying off the soda (not that type 2 is always that easy either, but that is the perception). It requires training by a competent diabetes specialist, lots of practice, trial and error, perseverance, discipline, and luck. But the training has to come first, and she hasn't gotten proper training yet after *three years*. She should have gotten training within *days* of her diagnosis with frequent support available while she brought her blood sugar down, and she should be seeing a diabetes specialist competent in treating T1D every few months.\n\nThat's literally all I'm saying: don't say she shouldn't see a diabetes specialist. There's nothing to argue about there. She *needs* to, before she has an emergency. Type 1 diabetes kills.", "If you don't mind me asking, what ended up being the issue/the treatment for it?", "She/her*", "A double whammy of ovarian cysts (not PCOS, just cysts) and endometriosis. While there's no cure outside of hysterectomy, I've managed pretty well with birth control pills and supplements (iron, B12, and D)."]}
