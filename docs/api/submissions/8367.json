Believe me I know that\u2019s easier said than done but if that\u2019s bad you gotta push. She should bring the smell up to a doctor and that changing it every hour isn\u2019t enough. She needs help.

It is a systemic disorder and can cause many lasting problems. Her doctor may know what it is... but it sounds like they don't care.\n\nSuggest putting her on Gabapentin (temporarily). If it helps her at all, then chances are very high that she will need to be evaluated by a specialist who deals with this.\n\nShe should not have to suffer.", "She needs to go to a different doctor then. There are plenty of shitty doctors where PCOS is concerned but it is a serious chronic condition that matters more than just with fertility concerns. \nYou need to work on your empathy towards your partner. I have PCOS and actually just came off a period as heavy as you are describing and the mental load of managing such a heavy flow on top of other symptoms is overwhelming and exhausting. My partner is supportive and loving with me though, I cannot imagine having a partner who gets irritated and puts pressure on me to \u201cdeal with it\u201d in the way you have.", "See a different doctor. I went years before I found someone to actually listen to me. I had PCOS and a polyp in my uterus that was causing problems and needed to be removed.", "Did the scent start with the brand switch?", "I ADORE my period underwear. Alternatively June makes a menstrual cup in a petite size all the way up to extra large and you can safely leave them in for 12 hours. \n\nSide note: the sickly sweet smell can be a problem with diabetes. I\u2019d bring this up at then next doctors appointment. The sweet smelling sweat or other bodily fluids is bad news with diabetes. Please, please encourage her to follow up with a new doctor until she has answers. Just in case her life depends on it.", "Yes!! They absorb more than pads and typical tampons. I thought the smell was not as intense as with pads too.", "They do. Doctors recommend them for women after birth too and that\u2019s quite heavy so it should be all good. They\u2019re expensive but the smell is almost non existent with these.", "Or if you\u2019re brave a menstrual disc.  Life changing.", "Ah jeez, then yeah definitely kind of an AH move", "No wonder OP didn't mention that in the post.. yikes.", "Oh wow. That is very often. I had assumed she was waiting for several hours or something. In that case, I'm not sure this problem is easily fixable without medical intervention. It sounds like maybe her diabetes isn't very well controlled if there's a sweet smell. Something to talk to her doctor about.", "Fair enough! Anyway, I hope you are able to resolve this argument. I think your ask is a reasonable one, just like it's reasonable to ask your partner to brush their teeth or take a shower if they are smelly.", "Ah. Yes well that changes things. I'll update my ruling :)", "Yes, suggesting treatment would absolutely address the source of her body odor.", "Then she needs to take better care of herself. The pads aren't the problem. The problem is she's not taking her health issues seriously and this is causing her to smell which impacts others.", "if you take birth control pills you can skip the placebo week so you don\u2019t have a period", "The U k's health ministry has approved this and there are some doctors in the US who will do it. Try to Google no more periods.", "It's two women, one with abnormal menstruation. Did u read OP post?", "Have you checked her blood sugars as well? Over 100 is not normal!", "I would think that if the discharge is the source of the odor then the pad should be changed as often as needed, not according to a set time. If the flow is that heavy that it's not being absorbed then it doesn't matter how long she's been wearing it. When it's reached its limit it's time to change.\n\nThe other issue would be is she cleaning herself in between changes? There's more to hygiene than just changing the pad.\n\nThere are other issues to be sure. I had a friend who during the change had to wear a tampon and a pad and had to change both every hour. You do what you must when the hormones are in flux.", "If need be every half an hour/ every forty minutes", "The overly sweet smell may be related to the diabetes- if you\u2019re not processing sugars correctly they can come out in bodily fluids like sweat and pee, I\u2019d imagine something similar can happen with period blood. That may be a bad sign and she should definitely bring it up with her doctor.", "I think it just compounds. Diabetes can make bodily fluids smell sweet in a very sickening way. I had a female colleague who had diabetes and unfortunately I could always tell when she was on her period. Thankfully her periods were regular, but honestly if I had to take it for the stretches OP claims, I would probably have quit my job. In itself both problems can be tolerable, but I can't imagine living with that smell constantly.", "The wild menstrual cycles could be a shitty thyroid. Easy blood test to diagnose - usually. Can be treated with meds.", "PCOS can aggravate or increase the risk of diabetes.", "An endo could help with any possible thyroid issues (excess/frequent bleeding).", "If her diabetes is so out of control that her discharge is smelling sweet, then it's also out of control enough to potentially kill her. She absolutely needs a diabetes practitioner (nurse or endocrinologist) who can treat type 1 diabetes specifically.\n\nI agree that an appointment with a good gynecologist is also needed, but don't ever underestimate or blow off type 1 diabetes.", "I can not drag her to the doctors, I do not believe the doctor will do anything anyway- girlfriends belief is if the doctor is concerned she\u2019ll be concerned, doctor isn\u2019t concerned so she doesn\u2019t care", "terrible advice and id suggest not buying that again urself, anything scented near your vagina is a ph imbalance waiting to happen", "Be careful with those, you could end up with irritation, a UTI, and/or yeast infection", "Every hour, maybe every hour and a half I\u2019d say?\n\nI hadn\u2019t thought of that in all honestly, I do love candles. Will try", "If she smells from changing it every hour there\u2019s definitely something wrong. I still thing NAH but honestly you should suggest alternative menstrual products overall. Maybe diva cup, tampons? It\u2019s not normal", "She already wears the night time ones, I did encourage her - she got a hormonal blood test, came back with a hormonal imbalance and the doctor said \u201ccome back when you\u2019re trying for a baby\u201d and she didn\u2019t bother complaining or asking advice", "where in any of this did you see OP call her partner gross?", "Op's calling the smell gross, she's not calling her partner gross - there is a difference.", "Do you have a specific brand you\u2019d recommend ?", "You\u2019re ignorant. OP said the doctors won\u2019t address it. None of this is on the gf, it\u2019s on the medical professionals failing her. \n\nYou can\u2019t get rid of diabetes, which is the cause of the smell.", "Obviously, not. I need sleep.", "I've smelled this smell in untreated diabetics and in all likelihood she's going to have this smell regardless of how frequently she changes her pad. It's not happening because the pad is saturated or old, it's the smell of a medical issue. She's gonna smell like that until she gets proper treatment.", "Every fucking half hour? \nYou're ridiculous. And that's hella expensive", "That's extremely excessive, unless she has heavy flow, in which case that's a medical problem.  Also are you willing to fork over the $$ needed for all those pad changes you say are necessary???  (Assuming it's just the odor that bugs you)", "Ok but the real question is how often does she SHOWER?", "Yta. Yikes. You should be really embarrassed about this, tbh.", "Are you going to buy the pads for her then? Because if you want her to change that frequently and with how long her period is, that would be expensive. YTA. There is no point in her changing the pad that often. If the smell is so bothersome to you, then either stop seeing her and actually get help.", "so are you gonna pay for how many pads she gets through? jesus i was on the fence but this is fucked up yta", "O my when I read this and you said that she wasn\u2019t taking care of herself I actually assumed that she had depression that was caused by her diagnosis and poor hygiene as a result. Now it\u2019s clear that you have ridiculous expectations that are rooted in your comfort rather than her well-being, you\u2019re asking her to change her pads every half hour rather than consult a doctor over a real medical issue. YTA", "You better be paying for all them pads or tampons then. thats expensive", "well maybe you should be the one buying her pads then, do you realize how many boxes she\u2019d go through if she did that? That\u2019s expensive! Urge her to seek more medical help or try and help her do research and see if she\u2019s having any common symptoms of possible medical issues? That is concerning and she needs to find an actual good doctor that will help her.", "Makes sense.\n\nBut I\u2019m not even talking about the smell as much as OPs girlfriend is clearly struggling with how much she is bleeding.\n\nfrom the post I get the vibe that OP is more concerned with her scent then the actual issue.", "The sweet smell is from your *pancreas (I think? Don\u2019t quote me) not working correctly, hence being related to diabetes. Hold on lemme google it really quick. I haven\u2019t had to look any of this up since my family members got diagnosed with diabetes\n\nEdit: wrong p-organ, but I was close. Her pancreas is probably barely functional if her sweat and endometrial (period) blood smells sweet. She might have diabetic keto acidosis, which is where her blood turns to acid because her body can\u2019t process sugar for fuel. \n\nFind a doctor to listen to you guys, OP.", "I'll be real: If you're not overweight, and you're not concerned, your doctor will often not be concerned.\n\nI had a major issue that I just kind of went \"whatever\" about because I figured the doctors would say something if it was a big deal. I was normal weight, normal everything else, though, so... they never said anything. It wasn't until I came in mid-attack and utterly miserable that the doctors started to take next steps. \n\nAnd, honestly? I get you on not being able to drag someone to the doctors and say \"I AM NO LONGER OKAY WITH THIS, LET'S FIGURE THIS OUT.\" It utterly sucks, and I think it's normal to feel helpless.", "Oh you've missed the point. \n\nHave you realised yet her bleeding is NOT normal and needs a specialist or have half the comments had to spill it out.\n\nEven google search would tell you the amount of bleeding is bad", "It doesn't sound like she's having honest conversations with her doctor.  If she's T1D and has a \"sweet\" odor, that's something she needs to talk to her doc about.  If he doesn't think it's serious, she should probably see another doc about a second opinion.", "A woman changing her pad every hour on their period is actually a lot. You should be able tonwear a pad for at least a couple hours before needing to change it. Sounds like she may have really heavy periods or needs more absorbent pads. \nAlso these periods of \"I don't care\" sounds like she's having depressive episodes. I have them as well and I'll go a while without showers, brushing my hair, forgetting to brush my teeth. \nBut changing a pad every hour isn't even a long time to have one on.", "That feels very frequent already if it is every hour.  I'll say YTA until you try some other options to manage the environment such as candles.", "Jesus. that sounds exhausting for her. The doctors haven\u2019t done anything about it? I feel like she might not care because when you\u2019ve had your problems ignored and dismissed by doctors it can start getting stressful and humiliating to chase a diagnosis. Then you have to debate if it\u2019s making your health worse\u2026 \n\nBut she has that heavy of a flow, that she is changing her pads every hour/hour and a half, and that is happening for 9 days\u2026 That\u2019s approaching serious blood loss. Is she tired? I have had half of her problem and I could barely function. \n\nYtA, though I do feel for you. It\u2019s just\u2026 the sheer work of living with a heavy period is so damn tiring. Thinking about it makes me want a nap.", "Get a different doctor.", "Get a second opinion, maybe from an endocrinologist? And from a female doc if possible (if it wasn\u2019t already\u2026they just seem to be more compassionate in this area imho).", "She needs another clinician asap. It\u2019s clearly not her hygiene and you should be supporting her to seek a second opinion, not about changing her pads more frequently. She knows you\u2019re taking a swipe at her hygiene and in this case, she probably feels unsupported and a lot of shame. That\u2019s not going to inspire self care.", "I know you said no medical advice but BV can smell either sweet or like pennies so just getting a little swabby swab from the GYN to rule that out couldn\u2019t hurt. It\u2019s a SUPER strong smell when you have it and since she\u2019s bleeding so often she may not even be noticing other symptoms. But with such frequent periods and bad hygiene I wouldn\u2019t be surprised by an infection diagnosis at all", "Get her doctor to refer her to a gynaecologist. It sounds like something else more serious us going on. She\u2019s changing her pad often enough. Please find her a doctor who will help her!!", "im finding a lot of derision in your tone re things she 'didn't bother' doing re chasing up long trails regarding her health. have you considered maybe actually accompanying her to dr appointments so you can support her in asking questions/advice? when you are unwell especially these things can be overwhelming and it's hard to always think/plan ahead on the spot when you're in a lot of discomfort.", "My god, OP. Your gf is suffering. Please seek medical attention and go to a different doctor. If I was bleeding that much I\u2019d freak out. Let alone the impending anemia. You can\u2019t ignore this issue. It will never go away without proper help. Please be reasonable here. All of this sounds VERY serious!", "I got a pack off Amazon. Get her 2 packs. They are pricier but worth it and will save a ton of money since she's going through pricey pads so often.", "I bought some from Bambody off Amazon because Thinx is crazy expensive. Figured I\u2019ll give the more affordable kind a shot before shelling out that much, and they work great! I have really heavy flow that soaks through ultra tampons plus pads if I\u2019m not able to change for two hours, and now I\u2019m good with tampons plus period underwear.", "Thinx is what I\u2019ve been using but basically just read reviews.", "Did I hit a nerve? My initial opinion that OP is NTA stands. \n\nThis is absolutely all on the GF. It's her health problem. People with health issues are responsible for knowing their issues and finding professionals who can help them. The fact that 'she'll go through periods of \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d' and leaving OP to put up with the effects is leaving her issue to be someone else' problem. \n\nOP's GF is the asshole.", "I think it is a little less complex in this situation. Diabetes is high blood sugar. The  blood coming out is full of sugar so there is actual sugar, changes in pH, increased bacterial activity, and more smell from all of it.", "I think that you\u2019ve missed the point. OP cannot FORCE her gf to make an appointment and see a specialist if GF doesn\u2019t want to.", "Or anemia if shes bleeding that heavy", "How is she the AH for something she can\u2019t control? The only nerve you hit is your own. \n\nThose periods of \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d are OP minimizing her gf\u2019s depression. I\u2019d argue that this issue is much worse for the gf, who is actually dealing with it. Once again, diabetes can\u2019t be cured, which is the reason for the smell. It doesn\u2019t have anything to do with her hygiene.", "Oh definitely that too."]}
