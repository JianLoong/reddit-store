{"id": 930, "submission_id": "ykje1r", "title": "AITA for not forcing my parents to invite my fianc\u00e9e to their upcoming christmas party?", "selftext": "Christmas in my (28m) family is a big deal. My parents\u2019 holiday parties are pretty extravagant and beyond family, only a select few get invites. This includes close friends and neighbors. My siblings and I can make suggestions but it\u2019s our parents\u2019 party at the end of the day, which means their decisions are final. My parents also happen to be notoriously hard to impress.\n\nA few of my friends have made the invite list for the party before, but slowly as I\u2019ve gotten older and lost touch with people, that list has dwindled down to just my longtime best friend and former roommate, Jordan (32m). We grew up in the same neighborhood and he even worked at my dad\u2019s company for the majority of his 20s. While he\u2019s my friend first and foremost, he\u2019s clearly also a friend of the family. My parents love him and have since we met when I was 15 and he was 19.\u00a0\n\nI got engaged in September after dating my fianc\u00e9e (29f) for around a year and a half. She wasn\u2019t put on the guest list last year and she didn\u2019t see it as a problem since she was busy with her own family festivities. I hadn\u2019t really put much thought into what might happen this year besides a brief mention to my parents about adding her sometime last month.\u00a0\n\nAs always, my parents email my siblings and I the final guest list on November 1st in order for us to look over it and give our thoughts as they finalize final numbers in preparation to send out invitations and RSVPs. As I looked over it this morning, I noticed my fianc\u00e9e's name wasn\u2019t on there. An important note is that the party isn\u2019t the only Christmas celebration had. I also stay with my family on Christmas night in order to open presents the next morning, and all significant others are invited to that. I told this to my fianc\u00e9e and she was livid. She said it was beyond disrespectful that Jordan got an invite but she didn\u2019t, and that I needed to stand up to my parents. I told her it was their party, and they had the final say but that Christmas festivities would still happen - this just gave her time with her own family again.\n\nAITA?\n\nETA: After texting them for a reason she was left out, my mom told me that multiple people had expressed distaste for her in the past and that she was trying to minimize the amount of negativity/drama as much as she could. If I had to guess, I know who these people are - my sister and Jordan - who have both had slightly unpleasant interactions with my fianc\u00e9e in the past where she claimed they were both stuck up. I now feel even more caught in the middle.

YTA\n\nETA: your post says \"beyond family\" most people don't get invites.

She knew there was a possibility, fiancee or not, that she might not be invited. It's a long tradition in your family from the sounds of it, and while to some it might seem elitist, to me it's called personal preference,  especially if there might be drama.

I don't think there is any need to \"stand up to your parents.\" I've lived through abusive in laws. This is not the same.", "YTA. Your soon-to-be ex-fiance will be much better off not going.", "YTA - It sounds like your fianc\u00e9 is correct that your sister and Jordan are stuck up, most likely your parents as well as their version of avoiding drama is to exclude someone. \n\nThis person is to be your forever person and you won\u2019t go to bat for them?

How dare Mr. Darcy fail to propose marriage--i haven't read Pride and Prejudice in awhile so I forget what great sin Darcy committed.

This is NOT what Christmas is about from a religious, spiritual or even Hallmark standard. Absolutely shame on you and your family. Newsflash, marriage will mean that your wife is your family now, and yeah above your parents or siblings. She either comes with or you should not be going. Period! \n\nYou sir, need to grow up. You sound like a teenager.

You need to decide if you respect your relationship enough to speak to your parents and make it clear that she is your family as well. \n\nAlso have you discussed the plan for Xmas this year?

My parents\u2019 holiday parties are pretty extravagant and beyond family, only a select few get invites. This includes close friends and neighbors. My siblings and I can make suggestions but it\u2019s our parents\u2019 party at the end of the day, which means their decisions are final. My parents also happen to be notoriously hard to impress.\n\nA few of my friends have made the invite list for the party before, but slowly as I\u2019ve gotten older and lost touch with people, that list has dwindled down to just my longtime best friend and former roommate, Jordan (32m). We grew up in the same neighborhood and he even worked at my dad\u2019s company for the majority of his 20s. While he\u2019s my friend first and foremost, he\u2019s clearly also a friend of the family. My parents love him and have since we met when I was 15 and he was 19.\u00a0\n\nI got engaged in September after dating my fianc\u00e9e (29f) for around a year and a half. She wasn\u2019t put on the guest list last year and she didn\u2019t see it as a problem since she was busy with her own family festivities. I hadn\u2019t really put much thought into what might happen this year besides a brief mention to my parents about adding her sometime last month.\u00a0\n\nAs always, my parents email my siblings and I the final guest list on November 1st in order for us to look over it and give our thoughts as they finalize final numbers in preparation to send out invitations and RSVPs. As I looked over it this morning, I noticed my fianc\u00e9e's name wasn\u2019t on there. An important note is that the party isn\u2019t the only Christmas celebration had. I also stay with my family on Christmas night in order to open presents the next morning, and all significant others are invited to that. I told this to my fianc\u00e9e and she was livid. She said it was beyond disrespectful that Jordan got an invite but she didn\u2019t, and that I needed to stand up to my parents. I told her it was their party, and they had the final say but that Christmas festivities would still happen - this just gave her time with her own family again.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
