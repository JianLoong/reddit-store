{"id": 930, "submission_id": "ykje1r", "title": "AITA for not forcing my parents to invite my fianc\u00e9e to their upcoming christmas party?", "selftext": "Christmas in my (28m) family is a big deal. My parents\u2019 holiday parties are pretty extravagant and beyond family, only a select few get invites. This includes close friends and neighbors. My siblings and I can make suggestions but it\u2019s our parents\u2019 party at the end of the day, which means their decisions are final. My parents also happen to be notoriously hard to impress.\n\nA few of my friends have made the invite list for the party before, but slowly as I\u2019ve gotten older and lost touch with people, that list has dwindled down to just my longtime best friend and former roommate, Jordan (32m). We grew up in the same neighborhood and he even worked at my dad\u2019s company for the majority of his 20s. While he\u2019s my friend first and foremost, he\u2019s clearly also a friend of the family. My parents love him and have since we met when I was 15 and he was 19.\u00a0\n\nI got engaged in September after dating my fianc\u00e9e (29f) for around a year and a half. She wasn\u2019t put on the guest list last year and she didn\u2019t see it as a problem since she was busy with her own family festivities. I hadn\u2019t really put much thought into what might happen this year besides a brief mention to my parents about adding her sometime last month.\u00a0\n\nAs always, my parents email my siblings and I the final guest list on November 1st in order for us to look over it and give our thoughts as they finalize final numbers in preparation to send out invitations and RSVPs. As I looked over it this morning, I noticed my fianc\u00e9e's name wasn\u2019t on there. An important note is that the party isn\u2019t the only Christmas celebration had. I also stay with my family on Christmas night in order to open presents the next morning, and all significant others are invited to that. I told this to my fianc\u00e9e and she was livid. She said it was beyond disrespectful that Jordan got an invite but she didn\u2019t, and that I needed to stand up to my parents. I told her it was their party, and they had the final say but that Christmas festivities would still happen - this just gave her time with her own family again.\n\nAITA?\n\nETA: After texting them for a reason she was left out, my mom told me that multiple people had expressed distaste for her in the past and that she was trying to minimize the amount of negativity/drama as much as she could. If I had to guess, I know who these people are - my sister and Jordan - who have both had slightly unpleasant interactions with my fianc\u00e9e in the past where she claimed they were both stuck up. I now feel even more caught in the middle.

She's your fiance and that should get her on the list. Early on you say your parents are hard to impress. Are suggesting and by your behavior agreeing that your fiance isn't impressive enough for them? Honestly, for me, this would be a hill to die on, were I your fiance. YTA\n\nETA: your post says \"beyond family\" most people don't get invites.

She knew there was a possibility, fiancee or not, that she might not be invited. It's a long tradition in your family from the sounds of it, and while to some it might seem elitist, to me it's called personal preference,  especially if there might be drama. If she doesn't like the way it's being handled, she isore than welcome to break off the engagement and find someone new. I don't think there is any need to \"stand up to your parents.\" I've lived through abusive in laws. This is not the same.", "YTA. Your soon-to-be ex-fiance will be much better off not going.", "YTA - It sounds like your fianc\u00e9 is correct that your sister and Jordan are stuck up, most likely your parents as well as their version of avoiding drama is to exclude someone. \n\nThis person is to be your forever person and you won\u2019t go to bat for them?

My ex did this to me and I left him.  He was the love of my life but a momma\u2019s boy.  I didn\u2019t and wouldn\u2019t compete with her.

How dare Mr. Darcy fail to propose marriage--i haven't read Pride and Prejudice in awhile so I forget what great sin Darcy committed.

This is NOT what Christmas is about from a religious, spiritual or even Hallmark standard. Absolutely shame on you and your family. Newsflash, marriage will mean that your wife is your family now, and yeah above your parents or siblings. She either comes with or you should not be going. Period! \n\nYou sir, need to grow up. You sound like a teenager.

They are not just disrespecting your fianc\u00e9e, they\u2019re disrespecting your entire relationship. Think carefully about how your family really sees you. Are you truly comfortable with that?\n\nI\u2019m going to be blunt: unless you grow yourself a spine (and fast) your fianc\u00e9e isn\u2019t going to remain your fianc\u00e9e for much longer. \n\nYTA if you go to the party.", "YTA yikes hopefully now that she\u2019s caught a glimpse of her future with in laws like yours she runs for the hills because guaranteed they way the act now won\u2019t change, they already look down on her when they are the classless ones who refuse to mesh with other outside their \u201clifestyle\u201d.", "YTA.

If family gets an invite she should get an invite - she's not a close friend or neighbour, she is your life partner. \n\nIf your best friend and sister hate her so much they would request she doesnt get an invite, I think that requires some reflection- do you need to talk to them about alienating your partner; her for her inappropriate behaviour; or both? \n\nEither way, your parents decision not to invite you both is a clear message to her that she is not family and they do not view her as your life partner. You need to decide if you respect your relationship enough to speak to your parents and make it clear that she is your family as well. \n\nAlso have you discussed the plan for Xmas this year? Does your fiancee want to spend Xmas morning with ppl who don't consider her family, or like her? Might be time to start your own traditions", "Yeah i think you are but its your parents party so we'll go with that... maybe since shes not invited to your parents maybe you go to her families for the holidays.

What happens next year when she\u2019s your wife and not on the list?", "YTA  Your edit didn\u2019t help you at all. In fact it made it worse. You have asked this woman to marry you but aren\u2019t putting her first. If I was her I wouldn\u2019t get married to you. Your family is disrespectful and mean. I am willing to get that this is just one thing in a long list of crap from your family to your fianc\u00e9e.", "YTA\n\nYour fiance deserves wayyy better than this. \n\nAlso, when do you go to her family for the holidays?", "YTA.

If you choose not standing up for your WIFE to be and running to mommy's apron, you will not have a wedding.       \n\n\nThe fact that you don't see the MASSIVE issues with this tells me you're not mature enough for a relationship, let alone a marriage.  You need therapy.  And I'm not using that as a middle school insult.  You need actual therapy with someone who can  help you learn to find your spine or your relationship and any future relationship is doomed.   \n\n\nYour mother is a mannerless asshole.", "YTA - Are you sure you are ready to be married?

So your sister and roommate were likely unpleasant to her in the past, which I can completely believe with how stuck up and pretentious your parents act with this gala and the invites, and because of how they treated your now fianc\u00e9 your parents have decided to shun her.  Nice.  Honestly even an invite at this point would be disgusting and obviously forced, making your fianc\u00e9 feel even worse.  Oh and your failure to immediately reject your invite when they excluded her shows how little you value her also.

But it's your duty to stand with your partner that's what marriage and being committed is literally all about. Your parents are sending a clear message, she isn't welcome.

It's a tough choice.", "YTA.\n\nYou didn't even reach out to your parents to see if it was a mistake. You immediately told your fianc\u00e9e that she wasn't invited. \n\nIf she isn't invited you could make the decision not to go.

My parents\u2019 holiday parties are pretty extravagant and beyond family, only a select few get invites. This includes close friends and neighbors. My siblings and I can make suggestions but it\u2019s our parents\u2019 party at the end of the day, which means their decisions are final. My parents also happen to be notoriously hard to impress.\n\nA few of my friends have made the invite list for the party before, but slowly as I\u2019ve gotten older and lost touch with people, that list has dwindled down to just my longtime best friend and former roommate, Jordan (32m). We grew up in the same neighborhood and he even worked at my dad\u2019s company for the majority of his 20s. While he\u2019s my friend first and foremost, he\u2019s clearly also a friend of the family. My parents love him and have since we met when I was 15 and he was 19.\u00a0\n\nI got engaged in September after dating my fianc\u00e9e (29f) for around a year and a half. She wasn\u2019t put on the guest list last year and she didn\u2019t see it as a problem since she was busy with her own family festivities. I hadn\u2019t really put much thought into what might happen this year besides a brief mention to my parents about adding her sometime last month.\u00a0\n\nAs always, my parents email my siblings and I the final guest list on November 1st in order for us to look over it and give our thoughts as they finalize final numbers in preparation to send out invitations and RSVPs. As I looked over it this morning, I noticed my fianc\u00e9e's name wasn\u2019t on there. An important note is that the party isn\u2019t the only Christmas celebration had.
