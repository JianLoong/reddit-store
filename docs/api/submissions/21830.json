So, no. He can't expect he gets to dictate food for the whole family and simply saying make your own meals doesn't stop him from feeling like he controls everyone's food. \n\nA true statement would be, make your own meals and keep your mouth shut about what we are eating.

It doesn't sound at all like OP's partner is trying to tell her how to eat, but put some boundaries in place for what he wants to eat.  \n\nI suspect most diets fail because of a lack of community support. People are always trying to attack someone for being healthy because they take it as an attack on their own health level. Moreover, processed food is some of the worse food you can eat so its not like the accusation that white bread is bad for you is unfounded.", "Please point to where in the post it implies that he isn't okay with having to cook his own food.", "Not all white bread.
