He wants to be on a restrictive diet, he can buy and cook his own food. Sure take his diet into consideration for a few things every so often, but expecting you to change everything just for him is beyond selfish.", "NTA. If he has a problem with what you cook, he can cook for himself like the adult he's supposed to be.", "Most \"fit\" people meal prep or buy prepackaged meals with the proper calories and macros. Let him get on the program, his own program. You're not his friggin nutritionist. Nta", "NTA - If he's unhappy with your meals he can make his own meals with his own money this shouldn't be a big issue. From this story alone it sounds like he's just telling you these things to make himself feel better but I could be stretching on that part. This is your body not his, he doesn't own you. Showing concern for your partner's health is normal but this is just excessive. \n\nHowever I do recommend sitting him down whenever you can to thoroughly express your concerns and feelings on the matter if you haven't already, his true feelings will probably come out then.", "NAH But it sounds like he has an eating disorder / body dysmorphia. You should probably try to wean him off the internet content which feeds his dysmorphia and encourage him to talk to a mental health professional", "He's the asshole, in the way that he's conducting himself. \n\nIn my opinion, if he wants to stick to an extremely strict diet, so much so that he thinks that white bread will give him cancer, then that's his life choice. You can't be mad at him for his diet choices, BUT he has to understand that it's not your choice too. He can't be telling you what to do and what to cook. I'd tell him to go make his own high protein, low calorie meals. Just because he wants to make that lifestyle choice doesn't mean you have to.", "NTA", "NTA - I agree with what others have said in that, if he wants to be that obsessive about diet, he should perhaps be cooking his own meals.", "NTA\n\nI feel you OP, you did not sign-up for this when you got together and he is the one who's changed , so he should bear the responsibility. If he wants to be on a diet he should be on one by himself unless you want to be as well. \n\nBut I know your main problem here is, that is sucks. From your post it seems like you like a nice home-cooked family dinner which is now a pain it the arse since either you all follow some high-protein strict dietary restrictions (also since he works out actively he should have different nutrition requirements than you and an infant) or you would separate groceries/cooking while he shames you for eating a white bread... both options are frustrating for people who are not into this lifestyle", "NAH - I think your husband should enjoy your foods, especially as he has the privilege of having fresh home cooked meals for him everyday, however, if he is serious about fitness, I believe you could work some system where you both try to work together to meet in the middle. Unless your husband is trying to go pro, he doesn't need to be religiously avoiding white bread and eating a ridiculous amount of protein. He should be just fine with regular household meals, as long some planning goes in before hand (i.e. if he's having a lower protein dinner, he should eat a higher protein lunch)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
