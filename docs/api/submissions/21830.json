Do other husbands only take out the trash or something? We are married PARTNERS, implying we share duties to keep the home running as well", "I see this all the time especially in Americans. \"I don't clean or cook so do you think I will find a man?\" Well girl....I think you work and so does he, right?!", "Exactly!!!!", "No, she said if he wants every single meal to be \"clean\" including what she and their baby son eat, he can live alone. As in, he can control his own diet, not the entire household.", ">AITA for telling him to shut up and eat a home cooked meal\n\nHow is this not forcing him to eat it? Everyone is saying that he should cook for himself. Idk what OP deal is, maybe she doesn't allow him to cook? It's weird.", "It's not the same. Orthorexia is an actual disorder that leads people to hurt themselves by obsessing over the 'perfect' diet and ending up either underweight or lacking nutrients, not to speak of the suffering caused by the constant anxiety over food.\n\n\nCrunchy moms/dads are just jerks who think they are nutrition experts based on stuff they read on Facebook or MLM programs, and want to force their crazy onto everyone else.", "Yes, sugar is one of the worse things for your body and it should be eaten in moderation, especially as you get older.\n\nI'm just pointing out the absurdity of people accusing the husband having an eating disorder when he does outrageous things like workout 4 times a week and point out that white bread is bad for you. Notice how OP is super vague about specific details that would help us understand if her partner is acting irrationally?\n\nI'd also point out that if the genders were reversed and OP had posted about an 8 year relationship between a 39 and 32 year old, the comments would talk about how the older partner is being control and questioning the age gap between them.", "We just don't have enough information to know if thats true. OP is even vague about who is cooking and if her partner is requiring additional work for meal preps (which should be taken by the partner making more requests.)\n\nAs someone in my late 30s, I don't see anything irrational about the partner's food requests. Some people want to keep weight off and exercise frequently because that helps give you the best chance at aging gracefully.  \n\nPlenty of obese people \"don't feel any distress\" about their eating habits until they are 50+ and suffer  the consequences of a lifetime of being obese.", " \nAm I suppose to be insulted by the term doorknob? Or is that the most mean thing you can say and get past the moderators? \n\nMy whole point is there is not enough info to tell here. How come OP gives his previous BMI but not a measurement for him now that he has \u201cminimal fat?\u201d That\u2019s screams unreliable narrator to me.", "That's just strange to me.\n\nIn my relationships, it's mostly been 'what are we cooking tonight'. I can recall a few times we cook for one another over multiple years.", "It's weird to me that some people, generally men in my experience, seem to expect that all meals need to be cooked. When I was single, I never cooked and rarely ate out. An apple and a chunk of good cheese was a great meal, and then there are sandwiches, salads, carrots and hummus, sausage and crackers, etc. Sometimes I will do a small charcuterie with different meats, cheeses and crackers.\n\nI'm super lazy though, and it's a lot easier to grab something from the fridge than cook a meal from scratch lol!", "Cool EVERY NIGHT!! Some of these men need to go back home with mommy \ud83e\udd23", "My husband doesn\u2019t cook except maybe frozen pizza or something similar. Not a skill he is really good at, we both agree to that. So I do nearly all of the cooking per stereotypical gender norms. I like it and I\u2019m good at it. It\u2019s fine by me. \n\nHowever, he does laundry. All of it. All the time. I can count on one hand how many times I have done laundry since we moved in together 13 years ago. The amount of people who give him the side eye for that is unreal. We lost a trivia game once because no one believed us.", "Wife and I marriage has been off and on her being stay at home mom.  When she's stay at home, she is more than happy to make us food and occasionally tells me the kids have been a handful, make dinner for her.  Cool, can't complain.\n\nWhen we both work, it's meal planstuff we can make and if she or I want to try something different, we take over dinner duties that night.  Although she'll help with small stuff like seasoning and whatever since she has a little more experience than me with just using whatever is in our spice cabinet if we don't have the actual ingredients (I am a recipe follower, for her recipes are just guidelines lol).", "Not sure this contradicts what I said. Either way she\u2019s right and husband needs to take care of himself if he has a special diet the rest of the household doesn\u2019t follow.", "It sounds to me like what happened with my family. I was taught if someone is cooking you food, you eat it and thank them. If you want something specific, you can make it yourself, but don't put extra work on the person already making the effort to cook.", "She may be the one who actually knows how to cook. She doesn't have to not cook for herself and their son because her man has a problem. He can learn to cook all the recipes he wants. I think OP is doing more than enough by changing her diet, and cooking ways for him. She never once said she HAD TO COOK. She never once said she doesn't allow him to cook. Sounds like she would love it if he lifts a pot top every now and then", ">How is this not forcing him to eat it?\n\nIs she force feeding him?\n\n>Idk what OP deal is, maybe she doesn't allow him to cook?\n\nBased off what?\n\n>It's weird.\n\nIt's actually not all that uncommon.", "You know that not every dessert is full of sugar, right?", "It was 24 and 30. Brain development ends at 25 so yeah, it's not great but it's not like she was dating a teenager. And before you say \"Oh but if the genders were reversed\", this is exactly what they say if the woman is close to 25. I'm usually the person who makes a comment about an imbalance of experience and income so I can say that pretty definitively. \n\nI, personally, think OPs husband probably never got the chance to really enjoy being young and attractive and he's getting a bit of that now. OP is much older than him and probably feels insecure about her aging and his changes. \n\nI do think him cutting whole food groups out of his diet and calling white bread cancer causing is concerning though. Most modern advice for healthy eating talks less about cutting out and eliminating foods and more about adding nutritious foods and moderate exercise. Diets that eliminate major groups likes carbs or fats are closer to fad diets or the past or \"lose weight quick\"  crash diets.", "She says he no longer eats carbs and wants everything to be very high protein. That's a very restrictive diet.", "Thats really strange, like you both work together on every meal?", "Yeah, as bad as this probably sounds I ended up ordering takeout a lot just so I didn\u2019t have to listen to him complain about not having dinner.  Then I got kind of fat from eating takeout all the time (he didn\u2019t because he wouldn\u2019t eat all day and would only eat whatever dinner I got for him).  So then he broke up with me because I was too fat.", "Sure but OP specifically said \" a bag of sweets or a chocolate bar.\"\n\nI know I like to eat coconut sugar chocolate but I would say its fair to assume that is not the norm.", "Yeah, that's not the end of the world either... its not optimal but if its a few treats here and there then that's fine!", "I didn\u2019t even pass judgment on OP. I was pointing out the absurdity of the commenter accusing the husband of having a eating disorder when the example of how he tries to be healthy, avoiding carbs/white bread and working out 4 times a week are normal things healthy people do.\n\nOP\u2019s habits sound just as normal without more context but it\u2019s only the person trying to be healthier that Reddit accuses of having an eating disorder. I wonder why??", "Because he's the one insisting that his spouse conform to his dietary standards when she cooks ... and that every food product bought must comply to his standards. And yet, he is not offering to take on the excess labour.", "Even that\u2019s not clear from the post. OP\u2019s partner cannot demand OP make a special meal for him but I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s what\u2019s happening. The way OP says her partner works out after \u201cwe\u201d go to bed shows how she characterizes them. The partner isn\u2019t going to bed if he\u2019s working out first and that leads me to believe OP is trying to dictate what her partner can even prepare on his own. \n\nWhich again, this sub would call a huge concern bc of the age gap if the genders were reversed"]}
