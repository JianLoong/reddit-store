If he does, are you ok with eating his meals or are you also complaining the way he is? Have you all considered how to satisfy various cravings? I have a vegan friend whose husband and kids eat meat and they easily figure how how to make foundational foods everyone can eat (perhaps a veggie stir fry over rice) and then incorporate the things her husband likes (piece of roast chicken or sliced steak, etc) into his and it did not require separate residences or a divorce. She likes to cook, so she does, but they both simply separate their things when his are going to require incorporated animal products. He may compromise on the vegan pasta, but she\u2019ll pull her portion out and finish his in a creamy Alfredo sauce if he wants while hers gets finished in a nice pesto instead.

He\u2019s also at the gym 4 nights a week (he usually goes once we are asleep).\n\nI need more info.", "Yes, that would be you making something up.  You may be right, you may be wrong, but *you made it up,* she never said it.", "Depends on the person and if they have larger and smaller meals throughout the day. My breakfast is relatively low calorie ~350, but my total intake is over 3k a day.", "OP left out some critical information and people are reading into it based on their biases.\n\nCan't even tell if he's doing any of the cooking or not. \n\nIs she demanding he eat whatever she makes? Or is she just refusing to make his special diet? OP didn't explicitly say either way.", "The vast majority of overweight/obese people are not bodybuilders. Come on.\n\nThat being said being a bodybuilder isn't good for your heart either.", "YTA: what\u2019s wrong with eating healthy? \n\n\u201che has minimal body fat\u201d according to who? Does he now have an unhealthy amount of body fat or just less than you\u2019re used to? If he\u2019s serious about turning his life around and getting healthy let him do it. Going to the gym 4 days a week is a completely normal routine, not sure what you\u2019re getting at there. \n\nThe hard truth is that \u201cpolishing off a bag of sweets or a chocolate bar a couple times a week\u201d isn\u2019t a sustainable diet. It ABSOLUTELY is damaging to your health. And \u201cthinking that you eat well\u201d isn\u2019t the same as actually eating well\u201d Eating healthy is a HUGE part of transforming your body and transitioning to a healthier lifestyle. Maybe try and work with him and figure out recipes you can both agree on rather than flat out refusing to hear him out?", "When my partner wants us to eat healthier meals, they complain about takeout and suggest lighter recipes that they like. They don't tell me that white bread will give us cancer.", "Yeah I\u2019m seeing a lot of bullshit in this thread. \n\nWanting to live and eat healthily is not an eating disorder. \n\nYou know what is an eating disorder? Getting fat because your diet is poor and you eat too much.", "I agree, why does she know his specific bmi when he was chunky but says his bmi is now minimal? Are we talking going from 27% to 5% or less? Or are we talking something like 27% to 15%. If he wants to get to 8-10% that\u2019s nothing crazy for a gym rat. If he\u2019s already shredded and wants to get lower then it\u2019s probably dangerous for his health, you won\u2019t hold that bmi for a long time. The way he talks about bread and his macros make me think he\u2019s a got an unhealthy relationship with food. Idk hard to tell what this guys health and diet is like when she\u2019s very vague about their cooking situation. He could be controlling what the whole family eats or she could be exaggerating and trying to rip on him for being healthy. Need more info", "The question is:\n\nWhat does OP define as minimum body fat?\n\nFrom personal experience, there are a lot of people in the US who grossly overestimate what a healthy weight is.", "Exactly this. My husband decided he wanted to do keto- and I told him he was responsible for his own shopping and cooking (generally because I couldn't find duck butter at our regular grocery store for example). I indulged his diet when it was a holiday making him a keto dessert but I think I shouldn't have to learn or think about such specific requests. Particularly now that we have children, it's already a lot of planning. NTA", "I think there is a chance husband might have an eating disorder. There is a form of ED where someone takes being healthy to the same extreme as someone with anorexia. \n\nStrict healthy diets are one thing but thinking white bread is the same as eating uranium is a big ol' flag. \n\nSometimes when people lose weight after feeling particularly \"fat\" or bad about themselves in that state they get paranoid about becoming that person again. They think if they have 1 cookie or give into temptation bam! they are going to turn right back into that \"chonk\" that made them feel so bad about themselves. She should keep an on him in case those gym visits increase to something like twice a day every single day or absolutely losing it if he misses a day.\n\nShe also mentioned he had a youtube channel he might be trying to become an influencer though god I hope not.", "As a man who likes to cook, this always baffles me. Cooking is fun.", "The one who works less cooks the meals. Period."]}
