The sister is overreacting for no reason. Maybe she wanted to have something to brag about it later on or what not. I'm glad you had fun putting together the crib and don't worry about your sister. Just ignore her. If she wants to have a relationship with you and your baby, then she will come on her own time.

The absolutely best way to react is to ignore her.  Drama queens thrive on attention.", "NTA. They left it their for WEEKS after promising to do it. Your sister is overreacting big time.

If I were you, I\u2019d send a group text along these lines:\n\n\u201cI know that you all wanted to help me by putting the crib together. I was so happy to have help from my family. I don\u2019t know why you guys didn\u2019t come to put it together sooner, and I\u2019m not asking you to justify but you have to understand that there was a 100-pound package in my entryway for weeks. None of you bothered to use your weekends to drop by to do what you offered to do. I will not take the blame for finally deciding to do it myself after weeks of it being left in my house, taking up space. And [sister], it hurts me to see you behave this way towards me. I expected to at least receive a text from you after the birth of my child but you couldn\u2019t even be bothered to ask if me and my baby were okay.

Be firm.  Stop being her punching bag.", "Of course NTA. Sounds like your sister thinks something has been taken from her by not being the one to put together a damn crib. But if she had prioritized this strange gift you didn\u2019t ask for or want, she would have been able to do it. But she didn\u2019t and now she\u2019s taking that out on your child.

Your sister's reaction is not normal. It makes no sense that she's placed so much importance into a crib. You may be better off with her ignoring you and I'd let it continue.", "NTA. Even if there was an issue with you taking care of that crib (which there isn\u2019t), your sister\u2019s reaction is way out of proportion.
