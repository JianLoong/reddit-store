Your sister has some unknown resentment towards you, and this is way too minor to take as such a grave insult that she won\u2019t even meet the baby she was so insistent on building a crib for. She sounds like someone who won\u2019t be a very good auntie. Maybe none of them will be healthy role models, but congratulations on living your own life on your own terms. NTA", "NTA. Why is your sister making it all about her? They said they will do but you waited weeks.. makes sense to me you did it yourself after all.. \nINFO: does your sister have children??", "NTA You didn't ask them for their help and you wanted to do it. The sister is overreacting for no reason. Maybe she wanted to have something to brag about it later on or what not. I'm glad you had fun putting together the crib and don't worry about your sister. Just ignore her. If she wants to have a relationship with you and your baby, then she will come on her own time. Until then congratulations on your baby and enjoy your time with them", "**NTA** \\- Sounds like your sister was just looking for an opportunity to create some drama.  The absolutely best way to react is to ignore her.  Drama queens thrive on attention.", "NTA. They left it their for WEEKS after promising to do it. Your sister is overreacting big time. I\u2019m appalled at the fact that she\u2019s treating you this way and hasn\u2019t even sent you a congratulatory text or asked how you and your baby are doing. If I were you, I\u2019d send a group text along these lines:\n\n\u201cI know that you all wanted to help me by putting the crib together. I was so happy to have help from my family. I don\u2019t know why you guys didn\u2019t come to put it together sooner, and I\u2019m not asking you to justify but you have to understand that there was a 100-pound package in my entryway for weeks. None of you bothered to use your weekends to drop by to do what you offered to do. I will not take the blame for finally deciding to do it myself after weeks of it being left in my house, taking up space. And [sister], it hurts me to see you behave this way towards me. I expected to at least receive a text from you after the birth of my child but you couldn\u2019t even be bothered to ask if me and my baby were okay. I\u2019m disappointed by this treatment from my family.\u201d", "NTA\n\nShe was treating you poorly and you called her out on it.  She then double-downed and is refusing to see  or acknowledge the baby.  That's her loss.  Drop the rope.  Don't reach out to her.  Let her come to you and apologize.  No apology = no time with baby. Be firm.  Stop being her punching bag.", "Of course NTA. Sounds like your sister thinks something has been taken from her by not being the one to put together a damn crib. But if she had prioritized this strange gift you didn\u2019t ask for or want, she would have been able to do it. But she didn\u2019t and now she\u2019s taking that out on your child. Sounds like an aunt your child doesn\u2019t need in their life.", "NTA.  The package sat in your entryway for weeks.  That's more than enough time for your family to have gone over and assembled it.\n\nYour sister needs to get over herself.  Your dad's reaction -- nbd -- was on target.\n\nYou're an adult. If you're mature enough to give birth and to raise a child without a partner in the picture, you are more than mature enough to ignore your sister's (and the rest of the family's) efforts to  go \"above and beyond to punish\" you for any perceived slights.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m not sure what exactly is going with your sister but that reaction was so over to the top this cannot just be about the crib.", "NTA- If they were so concerned with you putting it together yourself, they should have made moves to get there before a huge package was in your way for weeks.", "NTA!  She's not speaking to you or meeting your baby over a crib no one had time to put together?  She sounds toxic, spoiled and entitled.  Hold your boundaries and be the strong woman and roll model you want your baby to see!  Don't back down!!!! Congratulations!!!!!", "NTA...\n\nIt made her mad... she didn't say why though?", "NTA. Your sister's reaction is not normal. It makes no sense that she's placed so much importance into a crib. You may be better off with her ignoring you and I'd let it continue.", "NTA. Even if there was an issue with you taking care of that crib (which there isn\u2019t), your sister\u2019s reaction is way out of proportion. I\u2019d be willing to bet there\u2019s more going on which triggers such an extreme and dramatic response (maybe jealousy idk?)", "NTA.\n\nI'm sorry your sister is ghosting you. But it seems clear that this is HER problem, not YOUR problem.", "NTA, sounds like they are treating you like a child, they didn't show up, you put it together, it hasn't fallen apart, you did good. Keep it up.", "my wife painted the whole friggin hose while pregnant. you are pregnant not disabled or anything else. your sis i hardcore overreacting but she probably means no harm. NTA either way", "So because you did a task for yourself, she has decided that she no longer wants a relationship with either you or the new baby that they were so excited about? Your family sounds exhausting NTA.", "NTA. She seems incredibly controlling and petty.", "NTA. Your sister is definitely TA in this situation. Did she or your parents ever give a reason as to why they didn't want you putting the crib together?", "NTA, you tried to be extra nice and let them, which you didn't even have to do, but you got tired of waiting with a big package in your entryway.", "Info \u2014 have your parents visited with you & your baby? What\u2019s their take on why your sister is behaving like this? Is she jealous?", "INFO while I cannot endorse the abuse you received I am not clear on whether you notified your family of the inconvenience to you and you want them to hurry up. If you did not, I think you bear partial responsibility for lack of communication and effectuating a bait and switch. In no way is it reasonable for them to believe the delay was an inconvenience to you without you telling them, they would have no way knowing.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
