My gf likes to hike and after a few \"no fairs\" I got when I can step off the trail and wet a tree, I got her those funnels to keep in her pack. She hasn't used one yet, but it's nice to know they are there so we don't have to rush back to a nearby toilet.", "Ha. My grandpa used to say that. Thanks for the core memory.", "haha, and here i was proud of being able to hold it through a 3 hour movie after drinking two of those huge arizona iced teas when i was in my early 20s\n\nnow im in my early 30s and have to pee in the middle of the night from just drinking water for my medicine..", "I held it for a 22 hour flight once because there was turbulence before I went about 3ish hours in and there was pee everywhere but in the toilet it seemed. I went to try multiple times and my body just couldn't it was so gross. I'm hoping I'm fine cause other that 1 time I practically never hold my pee.", "The current life expectancy, in the UK, is at an average of 81.77 years.\n\nIn the US, it is at an average of 79.11 years.\n\nSo yes, 29 is young.", "Yeah, I've done it plenty of times", "Omg, I'm definitely getting a custom shirt that says \"GO PISS GURL\".  lol", "\"The more you tighten your bladder muscles, Tarkin, the more urine will slip through you urethra.\"", "I will never understand this lol. It\u2019s just your butt skin that\u2019s touching the toilet, there\u2019s no access to inside your body. Like sure I will sometimes hover if the toilet is absolutely disgusting, but sitting on a dry toilet seat isn\u2019t gonna do anything to your butt skin???\n\nI guess it upsets me because when people hover they get pee everywhere and it leads to some public bathrooms becoming a war zone.", "Healthy urine is very clean in comparison to pretty much the entire rest of our bodies.", "As far as I can remember up until 6th grade every classroom had its own bathroom in the corner of the room. Nobody ever had to leave and walk the halls to use the restroom.", "More evidence for my girlfriend to confirm I\u2019m actually an old man \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Same! I'm 29 and asked my doc why I kept having to get up and pee when I never used to and she was like \"well are you drinking water before bed?\" And like, yeah I am and she told me to stop drinking so much before bed :') damn you, hard working kidneys!", "What flight is 22 hours??", "Look for pelvic floor therapists! Also: the PelvicDanceFloor on Instagram shares a TON of related information.", "Ummm ..... thank you?", "Blood of a healthy person isn't harmful either, but I ain't touching random blood I find lying around", "I'm in the UK and that's def not the norm here unfortunately! I was a secondary school teacher but one of the schools was originally built for Years 7-9 (not sure if grades are the same across countries but roughly ages 11 - 14), when the school expanded to years 10 and 11 it wasn't big enough so many classrooms were portacabins on the field so unfortunately it wasn't even just a trek down the corridor, it was across the site. The other was a Studio School and only had 3 female toilets and they were shared between visitors, staff and students.", "\ud83d\udc74\ud83c\udffb", "I should of worded it better honestly the flight itself is 19 hours but the time from which I left my house to when I got to the next airport was 22 hours. It was to Singapore", "Yeah I know I just think it's tacky to post videos like that constantly and then refuse to answer when people panic if she's dying", "Well they're not touching random urine either", "It\u2019s not the norm in the US either, I don\u2019t think. My school was just set up that way. This was only until 6th grade though, where in the US we typically stay in a single room with one teacher the whole day at that age. I don\u2019t know how it is in the UK.", "She was laughing at me for days when a couple weeks ago I asked her if she could get my slacks out of the closet", "That\u2019s a fairly new one. I took \u201cthe longest nonstop\u201d once (at the time) and that was JFK to Hong Kong. That was almost 17 hours. The Sinapore one is fairly new. Either way, it\u2019s a long fucking time to be in a metal flying coffin.", "Because nobody will want to shake your hand afterwards.", "Idk about that one chief \ud83e\udd14", "They don't say they're not touching random urine. :)", "and here  was happily hovering for many decades, not knowing that some people have difficulties. But I guess, peeing is one of those things where you never talk about it and you just assume things based on your perosnal experience.", "Sounds ideal for younger kids (although I'd probs have been too anxious to use it in case anybody in class could hear! \ud83d\ude02). Def an advantage having them away from class when students are older because sometimes if you can see they're finding everything a bit much suggesting a quick bathroom break can be enough to help them chill out and focus again.", "#actionslacks", "It was just before covid", "Ok sounds fine for a quick pee lol.", "Usually cafes have always had the cleanest bathrooms for me, but it could be a region thing?", "Even better!\n\nYou'll be clearer (more sanitary) and *stay that way*\n\nBecause you won't be touching anyone else's dirty hands!", "They'll smell like piss.\n\nBut they will almost certainly be more sanitary. (, less bacteria, \"cleaner\")\n\nAnd if you use soap, they'll definitely be more sanitary\n\nOur hands get pretty freaking grimey.", "They're talking about using a pee funnel, which, since they're going to be the one using it means that it's their pee they'll have to wash off of it/their hands.", "As far as after then, most teachers had a token system set up so only X people could be on a bathroom break at a time.", "You rule", "Same here in Brazil, fast food, airports, metro stations bathrooms are the cleanest that I ever seen.", "I know what they're talking about. I was joking.", "That sounds like a great idea. I've got friends who worked in schools who banned bathroom breaks because students were arranging to meet up with friends and set off the fire alarm or flood the bathrooms etc. Result being all kids suffered.  That system would definitely have helped!", "Thanks, truth is, I am just old too. \ud83d\udc75\ud83c\udffc", "Ah. I see that now lol I've had a rough morning \ud83d\ude05"]}
