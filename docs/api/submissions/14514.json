Is she one of those people who cannot use public restrooms when you guys go out? She's still young, so it's not all bad, but she's gotta be uncomfortable. She will wise up to it eventually I hope. But definitely don't press the matter until you start noticing some issues. I dunnonwhere she works, but if it's a conve incentive store or similar place, they probably don't have a real cleaning schedule. It's more likely just \"if a mess is made clean it\" and no one does.

Can you suggest a compromise like she treats herself to a restaurant lunch break 1-2x week so that at least some days she has a nice bathroom break or help her find a starbucks on her commute home that she can use so she isn't sitting in the car having to hold it? Show her some literature on how holding your pee on cause kidney infections so severe that by the time they get noticed you need a new kidney (and good luck getting one) that you end up dying within 1-10 years of diagnosis? There is a girl trending on tiktok right now who held her pee in for as long as possible for her entire childhood due to a simple miscommunication with her parents and now as a young 20's adult she is on her death bed due to organ issues from holding it.", "NTA. Holding it like that can cause all kinds of kidney and bladder problems.", "NTA, she's DEFINITELY going to get a UTI!", "NTA\n\nHolding a full bladder all day long is very, very bad for her. You are right to be concerned, and to encourage her to find a solution that doesn't involve injuring herself for life. Since she shot you down the last time, I think it would be reasonable to try to talk to her one more time. Pick a time when you are both fed, watered, empty-bladdered, well rested, and not busy doing something else. Have sources ready to show her why you're concerned. Acknowledge that it's her choice, her body, but you love her and you are trying to help. Then listen.\n\nIf she's willing to think about other options, brilliant. Try to find a way to make the work bathroom usable for her. Are there alternative places outside work she could go at lunch? Even if it means more expense, or eating a sandwich at her desk after, it might be worth it to avoid the discomfort and cost of kidney problems later. Are there options just before and just after work, so her waiting period doesn't include the commute both ways? Would practice with a device so she doesn't have to sit make it easier? Basically I hope you can make this a problem you try to solve together. Good luck.", "NAH yet. You would be if you continued to push the issue. Let her get a uti and she will figure it out on her own.", "Isn't there a municipal or state department that inspects workplaces for sanitary conditions?

I think she might be a lot receptive if you lean more into understanding than into antagonizing.

I\u2019ve had one before and it was one of the worst experiences of my life. The feeling of having to constantly go to the washroom and the pain is unbearable. If she doesn\u2019t stop this habit, she will develop serious bladder problems when she\u2019s older and they are no walk in the park.\n\nEDIT: about the washrooms at work: there is no evidence of anyone contacting a disease from sitting on a toilet.

She\u2019s still young but into her 30\u2019s and 40\u2019s she\u2019s going to regret this big time. Maybe find some information, pamphlet, and leave them around the house when she will be there and you won\u2019t. It\u2019s non confrontational and allows her to investigate at her leisure.

Choosing a better time will be good.", "NAH but she absolutely shouldn't be holding her pee. Learn to squat, bring sanitary pads, anything. This is all better than holding in pee for several hours.

Maybe gift them to her so you offer a solution instead of (in her POV) criticize her\n\nEdit: i wash them in the sink of course, and pee is pretty much a clean thing so it's not nasty to touch it with your hands.

It does contain a small amount of bacteria and will pick up more on the way out of you. Sorry I know I'm being pedantic but a lot of people think pee is sterile when it actually isn't.

It's absolutely fine as they're washing the tingamy and their hands I wasn't trying to at them at all. My point was more on the still widely held belief that urine is sterile when it isn't, as that can have its issues."]}
