She really _should_ go to bathroom more often.", "No, NTA, you showed concern for her health on a very justifiable basis!", "I was on a work trip in China, we were taken for a lovely meal on the boat, the only problem it wasn't the most modern boat so the toilet was literally a small room with a bucket, a large orange bucket.\n\nI bit the bullet, she didn't.\n\nWe jumped off the boat and into a car.  5 hours later we were still in the car with two people who didn't speak a word of English and no internet on our phones to work out how to ask 'can we stop for the toilet'  Needless to say she was in quite a lot of pain by the time we got to our hotel.  It was raining as well which did not help.\n\nHaving a grotty pee is better than not going it at all. \n\nNTA", "NTA - you are worried about her health. There\u2019s nothing you really can do but support her. Your not in the wrong though to be worried.", "I did that and got a UTI. Now im on a shit ton of antibiotics and it is NOT going away", "Nta, what your wife is doing could be really dangerous. Some advice i can give you is maybe to purchase for her (it might be a nice gesture to show her you really care about her health) those one time use toilet seat covers, they are made of acetate paper and you can easily store them in your desk and just throw away once used. they are like a 50 piece package for 5$ on amazon. If the issue is about cleanliness, that can make a huge difference. I travel a lot and they have saved my ass (literally) when i had to use bathrooms that hadn't been cleaned since they were built.\nThey aren't the most ecologically sustainable product but it's way better than a kidney infection.", "NTA. I\u2019m 27 and I have serious bladder issues because of doing this since I was a child.", "NTA. It\u2019s not healthy to do that. If this bathroom is really that disgusting then her employer needs to do something about it. And if the bathroom isn\u2019t actually disgusting and your wife just has a thing about using public bathrooms then it\u2019s something she needs to see a therapist about/work on", "NTA. This can cause kidney infections or failure.", "Nah, you\u2019re NTA. Holding your urine for extended periods of time can weaken the muscles of the bladder which can lead to incontinence or uti\u2019s (like you said), both not a fun time. If the bathrooms are as nasty as your wife says, then it\u2019s an HR issue. Good luck with this OP!", "NTA", "NTA I love getting paid to shit and I think everyone should do it. I've held in a morning dump before so I could do it on the clock.", "NTA, im a doctor and people holding their pee for that long can lead to acute kidney injury. As someones else said this can cause long term health issues.", "Please show her the post. My friend used to to this and she got UTI eventually. She started to bleed while peeing. And she started to pee every 15 minutes. \n\nShe needs to use the washroom atleast twice", "NTA. I can understand the initial attitude of your wife, but it\u2019s really concerning for her health. She can really damage her kidneys if she isn\u2019t careful.", "I think my record is a solid stream for around 3 minutes", "NTA, you're looking out for her wellbeing. The situation is ridiculous.", "NTA, holding your per can lead to really intense health complications. Your wife needs to smarten the fuck up", "NTA, I had a similar conversation with my SO a few years ago. UTIs are no joke. And perhaps she's not even hydrating herself properly. If you drink water during the day, you would need to pee at least once in 8hs.", "My wife loves here [shewee](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=the+shewee&adgrpid=55625371603&hvadid=589894273425&hvdev=m&hvlocphy=9011860&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=b&hvrand=4950762575473559693&hvtargid=kwd-296012663262&hydadcr=9882_13553022&tag=hydsma-20&ref=pd_sl_6orkuztjj3_b)\n\nKeeps one in her bag so she doesn\u2019t ever have to hold it", "General nah I can understand your concern but it might come across a bit patronising. If she doesn't like sitting on public toilets she could try something like a shewee it's a type of funnel that allows a woman to go to the toilet standing up. The last thing she wants is a UTI those can be painful and difficult to get rid off.", "NTA her behaviour isn't healthy. I did the same in school and caused myself a chronic bladder inflammation. Be persistent", "nta as someone who did this exact thing then ended up hospitliazed for a week due to kidney infection/ stones don't hold pee", "NTA. I too held my pee in school because the toilet was revolting. Maybe she got mad that you framed it kind of mean. Hope she finds a solution tho.", "Worked in a hospital before and held my pee all the time (not on purpose). 100% gave me problems with the muscles. NTA. It\u2019s not fun to deal with and she doesn\u2019t want to get to that point.", "NTA you\u2019re concerned and it\u2019s completely normal , but at the end of the day it\u2019s still her decision , sorry", "I used to hold my pee a lot til I started getting UTIs all the time. Now I go every time I even slightly feel the urge to go (probably also not good but I\u2019ll take frequent peeing and whatever else comes with that over a UTI any day)", "NTA its really unhealthy for her :c", "YTA.  You've expressed your concern, given your reasons why, and offered suggestions.  She's an adult, stop pushing it.", "I follow a woman on TikTok who, in her 20s, is dying from kidney failure due to holding in her pee for most of her youth. You are NTA and I hope she does some research before she does some permanent damage.", "My dude, you are married to a grown ass adult. Mind your business.", "NTA, however I feel you could have just told her as an alternative to drink less fluids while at work, that\u2019s what I did when I worked at a place with a pretty disgusting bathroom and it worked wonders for me.", "Noooo your wife should absolutely be going \"potty\" if not the second she feels an urge to then very soon after!! Not the asshole @ all", "NTA, but maybe the way you said it was less than ideal.", "IMO she's just being a TAD too picky about the work bathroom. Although truthfully it probably shouldn't be a big deal in the first place. Is she bumping into things on the way inside or something?", "Another perspective here -- Shut up and let her handle it.  You said your piece, now leave her alone.  Could be she's worn down by years and years of other people being all up in her business and micromanaging her every move.  Could be that you listening to her pee, commenting on her peeing, telling her that she needs to \"suck it up\" without knowing what it's like at work, telling her to go to her supervisor, telling her to quit, telling her to.... Do you see a pattern here?  How about LISTENING to her and at most asking her questions that would help her to work out how to deal with it.  I work with teenagers, many of them who have been abused and they have problems with self-care just because of invasive, judgmental \"telling\" of how they are SUPPOSED to be acting and feeling at every step of their lives.  Back off.  Let the woman speak and work it out for herself.", "NTA. I get kidney infections when I do this. I now also have stress incontinence. If I really need to pee now, I literally can't hold it in. Holding in your pee is no joke in the long run. I regret that everyday!", "Yikes, nta I'm concerned too", "this is a completely reasonable concern. NTA", "NTA. I did this during the day for a week as a kid (I was in a place I wasn't comfortable asking to go). I got a bladder infection. It's not good. Can't she at least leave at lunch and find a clean restroom elsewhere?", "No. NTA. I was born with one kidney, and as a small child until I was 16 years old I was scared to pee in public/school due to a traumatic event that happened while I was in the bathroom. It has caused me serious injury to my only kidney and I really regret it. I go as soon as I have to now.", "NTA/YTA is that such a thing. I work in location where bathrooms are dirty and I don't feel safe using them. Has your wife complained to management about the bathrooms", "NTA. Also a teacher and someone who gets urine/kidney infections frequently due to an autoimmune condition. This is not healthy in the long run.", "cue that tiktok girl who\u2019s literally dying in her 20s because of this\u2026. no way he\u2019s an asshole for looking out for her health!", "As a parent of 2 children with kidney problems (from birth) every hospital appointment they have I am reminded that you shouldn\u2019t hold your wee (one of my kids had a kidney removed at a year old). The only time my kids hold their wee is when they have an ultrasound scan done on their kidneys and bladder. I also know people who have got kidney issues because of holding their wee. \n\nKidney damage is no joke \n\nOp you are NTA at all for being worried about this.", "A lot of people who don't use the bathroom at work (for whatever reason) also often develop bladder and colon cancers", "It is dangerous. Anyone here remember the case of the on air radio contest \" Hold your wee for a Wii \" . Radio station told contestants to drink water and hold their pee in and whoever lasted longest would win a Wii. One of the people ended up dead.", "But the way OPs approaching it is making her shutdown instead of being receptive to what he\u2019s saying. That\u2019s a basic communication skill he needs to work on.", "Reminder that NTA implies wife is", "Ever heard of Tycho Brahe? Famous astronomer, has stars named after him. He went to a party but decided to wait until afterwards to pee at home.  \nHe died 11 days later due to bladder infection. Because his bladder burst.", "Correctamundo", ">but ultimately it is her body, her work\n\nAnd OP's responsibility when she gets a UTI and triggers an extreme mental/emotional change.

Also leads to eventually losing control of your bladder as you get older, so you wouldn't be able to control when you pee.", "Not just bladder issues, but kidney issues as well", "NTA", "I ended up saying NTA but I was close because of this reason. If it wasn\u2019t so dangerous for her to do it, I\u2019d 100% agree with you :)", "YTA doc. No, you cant leave the operating table while you\u2019re in surgery but that is literally life and death. In any other context this is not acceptable.", "yes definitely buy a urinary device. pstyle, shewee, there's several brands. practice at home first", "I think they also make one use ones", "Alternatively, she can get disposable toilet seat covers (individually wrapped!) on Amazon. Not expensive and easy to keep in your bag or pocket. Toss in some Lysol wipes (also individually packaged or travel size) if she wants to do a quick wipe down first. \n\nObviously, no one should have to deal with a gross bathroom at work (and maybe a complaint to the manager is also in order) but if the choice is between \u201cinvesting\u201d in sanitary products so you can take care of business or developing kidney problems later on\u2026\n\nA funnel is a good idea- but you have to deal with washing it etc. This is a more convenient solution- albeit less environmentally friendly.", "You can definitely hold it all day if you dehydrate yourself. Very unhealthy as you say. Stinker headaches from the dehydration too. Do not recommend.", "It's because I know how horrible it is having to wait I've never refused to let students leave my class. Worked for a couple of schools that had a strict 'NO TOILET VISIT' rule (unless student had medical pass) and if a student was seen out they'd be asked who their teacher was and we'd be in shit for letting them out. If a kid asked to go my reply was always the same, 'Of course, you're asking to go because you feel a little unwell'. They knew I was running a risk letting them out, never had a single student take the mick and ask when they didn't need to go or take more than a couple of mins or get the story wrong when they were challenged by SLT. I just saw going for a wee as a basic need and right! We had each others backs and it worked.", "Wasn't that like, water poisoning though?

Or am I thinking of some other dumb contest...", "Her name is Kendra her whole thing is telling people's she's dying soon and then later admitting it's not that soon", "I also had to go to PT for similar reason. It was super awkward but it was so worth it in the end.", "Wait what?!? That\u2019s incredible. What\u2019s the manual adjustment. I need this.

It's clean enough that if you scrubbed your hands in pure piss *without soap* your hands are almost certainly cleaner after than before.", "From what I've read the position it puts your body in can make it an issue, leaving enough urine in your bladder with bacteria that it can develop further into a UTI. \nI will add, I'm not sure how big a risk you take for getting a UTI from hovering, just that it could happen.", "I've got good thigh muscles but even I'd struggle to relax my pelvic floor whilst hovering in that position.", "That generally means the floor gets a quick mopping, the toilets have bowl cleaner sitting for a few minutes and then flushed and the sinks and counters get a wipe.
