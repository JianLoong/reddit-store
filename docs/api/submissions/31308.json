This is not a hard set cultural tradition in the US. It\u2019s really a personal familial tradition. I find it odd that they are being aggressive about it.", "NTA. New people in the family don't get to change family traditions. And in the US, some people open christmas gifts on christmas morning and many do it on christmas eve.", "NTA. You're hosting, so it's your decision to celebrate Christmas however you feel like. They can take it or leave it.", "NTA - and dear god, talk about luxury problems, when you're stressed about getting gifts and eating lots of delicious food on one day instead of the other.

There is no one particular way \"people from the USA\" celebrate anything, it all depends on their ethnic and religious, and sometimes even regional, background. So your cousin's husband's family opens presents on the morning of the 25th. Plenty of American families do it your way. Your cousin is a drama queen -- you are not being either intolerant or bad hosts. You don't need to change anything. Invite this family to your celebration, and they can do their own next morning, their way. It shouldn't make them feel excluded and alienated (unless they *want* to feel this way) -- it should only make them feel like welcome guests at your celebration, which her husband and children would be, if they are raised differently.

I don't know what culture you are, but it isn't that extreme to do the big celebration on Christmas Eve. That's the story of the Nutcracker IIRC.", "NTA Americans are more than capable of adjusting.  Even if the kids are little and believe in Santa, just tell the kids that St. Nick delivers the night before in your\n country (that's how he gets so many stops in so quickly by scheduling Christmas deliveries too).", "NTA.\n\nIt is not a US thing to have it on Christmas morning, I think it is closer to 50%-50%.\n\nThere are many families in the US that open presents the night before, after a feast.  My family did it that way.  They then had stocking stuffers (small gifts in an actual stocking) Christmas morning for the \"Run down when you first woke up Santa came!\" phase.  Then a Christmas brunch--usually cracked crab, a local delicacy.\n\nThree should definitely accomodate 50.  I would suggest the cousin hold back some small gifts and have a mini-Christmas Day privately if that is her thing.", "NTA\n\nI'm an American and I promise you opening gifts on Christmas Eve isn't some world-shattering change.

NTA.", "> it seems like people from the USA\n\nlol NTA\n\nPeople have various ways of doing things. Some families open gifts on the 24th, others on the 25th. Sometimes nuclear families open gifts on the 24th with each other, then go to a bigger event on the 25th, and vice versa.\n\nYour cousin is asking you to replace your years long tradition with the ones from the new guy. If it means that much to her, she can host a big event on the 25th.", "NTA. They are visiting and I guess expecting the experience of celebrating Christmas in your family traditional way. I don't see intolerance in any way. If they want to wait until morning to open their presents, they should be free to do so with the understanding that they are the ones excluding themselves. I guess that if I was the one visiting you, I'd be thrilled to join your celebration, understand it, try new food, learn more about your family and generally enjoy it as well. With every new experience you live your life becomes richer and get to understand it. You might as well have a conversation point on why do they wait until Christmas morning to open presents and so you will enrich your life as well.", "Definitely NTA, the morning thing is fun for little kids but the adult thing is so much better the evening before. Maybe growing up outside the US is why I do this. I have come up with a pretty good fix now that I\u2019m in the US, and it may work for your too. You do both :), swap presents between adults the night before, and the presents adults give to kids. The morning is for Santa gifts to whoever in the household gets those so when my kids were little there were quite a few from Santa and I still do this now that they are older. It\u2019s actually really fun. You can even put one gift aside for everyone from Santa if you do those things. So the evening feels like a family affair with gifts and the morning is Santa and all that magic.", "NTA she and her family are not the majority. If she wants presents to her and her family set aside for Christmas morning that\u2019s a fine compromise but expecting everyone in the family to change to her tradition for her is so entitled. If she\u2019s so controlling that she can\u2019t come without the change than she doesn\u2019t come. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d cry if someone that entitled didn\u2019t come for Christmas", "NTA.  It wouldn\u2019t kill them to experience how other parts of the world live.", "NTA, you have your traditions and the first time these people visit they want to change them... Wrong on them. We also open gifts on Christmas eve, these are the gifts from cousins, aunts etc. direct family  gifts are open Christmas morning, parents siblings ect. In this situation we would keep our traditions and make sure that the cousins also had gifts to open on christmas morning with whatever family they were staying with.", "NTA. There is no \"Logic\" to how you celebrate. It's all tradition. Your cousin is being rigid and intolerant by insisting that her way is the right way. Rather than have the majority change to accommodate her tastes, it would be more respectful for her to \"do as the Romans do.\"", "NTA,  but notice that it isn't your cousin's husband making this request; it's your cousin. Her husband may have mentioned this seems odd to him and she took it and ran with it. He may or may not be part of it.\n\n\n They may also be bringing presents from \"Santa\" which the kids can open on Christmas day, so a blending for the kids might be nice. (How do you explain to kids that Santa came to that house on the day before Christmas Eve?)", "I think it\u2019s more rude to expect 50 people to change for you, while a few of them even are opening their home to you to host you. Demanding change doesn\u2019t work well. Also, what is the big deal? It\u2019s a 12 hour difference. They can do their thing on the 25th as a family of four if they want. There\u2019s no need for 50 people to adapt to 4. NTA", "NTA - this is not a culture thing. This is a preference thing. As someone from US I\u2019ve seen every combination. Opening 24th. Opening 25th. Opening at midnight. Opening first thing in morning. Splitting them due to different families. Having them on different days due to custody/deployment.", "So she\u2019s staying home? Cool. NTA", "As someone from the USA, she's full of crap. I've always had a separated family and we would do one part of the family on Christmas Eve and open all the presents then, then go to the other part of the family on Christmas Day and open presents with the other part of the family then. There is no \"it must be on Christmas Day\" tradition in the states. NTA keep it how your entire family is used to.", "NTA\n\nYou host the holiday you want and invite your guests.

Why? Aren't they invited to the event as well? How are they being excluded?\n\nFrankly, I'd have no tolerance for her nonsense. You've opened gifts on the 24th and I see no reason why you should change that just to suit some entitled Americans. You've extended her an invitation, not a summons. If they choose not to go, so be it!", "When in Rome do as the Romans do...\n\nShe should celebrate on the 24th with you.\n\nIf you go there another year you should celebrate on the 25th with them.", "NTA. Your cousin should respect your family's traditions and not expect everyone to change just for them. It's important to find a compromise, but ultimately, the majority should have the final say.", "There are couple of options\n\n1. They are the only people in the family who have kids who believe in Santa - then celebrate Christmas their way. \n2. There are kids on both sides (or only on non-US Side) that believe in Santa - do it your way. Tell the US kids that Santa starts early in your country so he can deliver all the presents to all the kids around the world. \n3. Nobody believes in Santa - flip a coin or do both ways ( you give your presents on 24th, they give their presents on 25th), doesn't really matter. There is no \"more logical\" way as it's all just tradition and Santa (spoiler alert!) is not real.", "NTA. It's your family's tradition and it's understandable that you want to keep it that way, especially since there are so many people involved. Your cousin's request is a bit unreasonable considering the majority of the family is on your side. It's important to respect each other's cultures, but it shouldn't come at the expense of your own traditions.", "NTA they can celebrate both ways if they want. Do yours on the 24th and they can save there family gifts for the morning of the 25th", "NTA - It's your family's tradition and you shouldn't have to change it for a few people.

And one of them is a person who presumably for many years had no problem with your way - but now she's seen how foreigners do it, she's so special, right? \n\nI myself don't have strong opinion on the tradition - my family do it both ways in the different years, depending how we feel like. But I think you should not give in, it's not right to encourage such rude demands.", "NTA - it would be courteous for her to respect you, your culture, your family, and your family traditions while celebrating in your home as their guest.

I have the exact same  mix of cultures going on. Everyone comes to our place on the 24th and the presents given by us get opened then. The next morning we go to the Americans place and the presents given by them get opened there. We each host one meal. And the kids certainly never questioned it (seriously, why not have Christkind AND Santa?)", "NTA. You're hosting.  As the host, you get to set the schedule for your celebration.   Why would you make 50ppl change the routine for 2ppl? How will them celebrating on Christmas Eve make them feel alienated? That's silly\n\nPlenty of families in the USA celebrate on Christmas Eve,  go to Midnight Mass etc.", "NTA. Family Christmas on Christmas Eve as usual, Santa comes Christmas morning for all the little American boys and girls. That is enough of a compromise, and no one will die from a lack of Christmas magic.", "NTA. You could do family gifts exchange on Christmas Eve (24th) and do Santa gifts Christmas Day (25th).

More so, I\u2019m American,  and people open gifts with family from the 24-26th or whenever they are able to get together over the holiday.

And how exactly is she excluded when she is part of the festivity??\n\nI grew up a the first child born in Australia to Eastern European refugees. We celebrated Wigilia on Christmas Eve then went to Midnight Mass. We got to open Santa pressies on Christmas morning (which somehow were conveniently & mysteriously delivered while we where at Mass) and then a Christmas lunch with the extended family (Uncles were married to Aussie women) because mum and dad liked the Aussie tradition and thought the more festivity the better - though dad in particular really missed St Nicholas day on the 6th of December. \n\nI'm not saying OP should do both, by the way!! Just that perhaps a less rigid mindset on the part of the cousin is needed. \n\nWe were surrounded by different cultures who all did Christmas a little differently, and honestly, we loved the different traditions, sharing different foods, and experiencing different things. It's something to be embraced and not feared. Your cousin is narrow minded and a little bit racist - her traditions are no more valid than your own - and if she let herself let go of her pre-conceptions she might just experience something quite lovely.

This made our Mom extremely happy as she could watch us open our presents and we could clean up our wrappings/boxes from the presents.  This allowed her to spend her mornings cooking the enormous Christmas dinner for us, our extended family and sometimes friends.  I continued that tradition for basically the same reason.  My daughter did not as she didn't have to cook a large meal for just her and her daughter, they came to my house.", "NTA - as someone from the US they should be showing respect for the host and celebrating in the way their country does. Not everyone has to do things the way Americans do, they need to learn and adapt to new cultures.", "NTA\n\nMy family (in the USA) always does a family Christmas on the 24th so we can spent the 25th with our individual family units.

Woohoo!\n\nI may have \"only\" had one present to open, and I had to sit quietly and watch while my half/step siblings had many, but I got FOUR Christmas celebrations.

Feast days go from sundown to sundown, so the Christmas Day feast starts on the evening of the 24th. You are legit celebrating in the traditional, millenia-old way. So she needs to just...shush with her ignorance.\n\nOn top of that, it's incredibly rude and entitled to presume dozens of other people will change their traditional way of celebrating because she wants to do it differently. Your house, your rules. \n\nPossible compromise: Why can't they do both?! The Christmas feast is an octave!!! It's *eight* days, starting the evening of the 24th.

She said that she lashed out in an attempt to both continue minimizing her family's contact with our culture and because she genuinely thought their way was better and that we should emulate it. \n\nBut she talked with her husband and her husband was actually very excited to try out our way of celebrating. So they are coming and we are celebrating on the 24th.\n\nI'm a bit sad that she thinks we are embarassing, she had made some weird jokes about our country and us being such a stereotypical latin american family before but I didn't know she felt that way.
