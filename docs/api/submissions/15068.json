I (26f) was invited to my grandparents\u2019 54th wedding anniversary along with the rest of my family. My (28f)sister brought along her (39m) boyfriend, which wasn\u2019t unusual as they\u2019ve been dating for three years now. I\u2019ve never liked him due to their large (imo) age difference. It\u2019s just always been really awkward being around him, which may be my fault as I\u2019ve been cold to him. Our parents don\u2019t seem to have any issues with him. Anyways, at their anniversary dinner my grandpa gave a speech about my grandma, which was really sweet. After his speech, my sister\u2019s boyfriend stood up and started tearing up and talking about how much he loved my sister. He then got down on one knee and proposed to her. I thought that this was really weird as it was my grandparents\u2019 anniversary dinner and it was supposed to be about them. I stood up and cleared my throat at them to try and send them the message that this was not the time or place. I know it probably wasn\u2019t up to me to say something, but I\u2019ve never liked my sister\u2019s boyfriend and thought this was a really inappropriate setting. My sister\u2019s boyfriend then started yelling at me saying that I was ruining their special moment. My sister just stood next to him with her arms crossed. No one else said anything and we left immediately after. I feel like I\u2019ve ruined my grandparents\u2019 anniversary and, on top of that, made my sister and her boyfriend mad at me. Our mom and dad have yet to say anything, and I can\u2019t stop thinking about how awkward the whole situation was.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: for those asking my sister\u2019s bf was her professor in college and that\u2019s why I initially didn\u2019t like him.", "created_utc": 1681783524, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12q6aiw/aita_for_ruining_my_sisters_boyfriends_proposal/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So yeah...\n\nYTA", "ESH\nSister's boyfriend is an asshole for having the absolute audacity to make someone else's celebration about him. The yelling at you was ridiculous  The whole thing is just so gross and tacky. \nSister is an asshole for going along with the above. I'd be livid and completely humiliated if I were her.\nYou're an asshole for making an even bigger scene. Had you just let it play out the anniversary celebration probably could have been salvaged.\n\nYour poor grandparents deserved better.", "Hey, everyone makes mistakes. It's ok.\n\nSo yeah. YTA. \n\nIt wasn't your party, it wasn't your engagement, its not your boyfriend, its not your choice.  You were a fellow guest, not the host.  You're right, it wasn't your place to say something. \n\nIt's your sister's choice who she marries. She will be the one who has to live with the consequences of her actions, there's honestly nothing you can do about that. If you want to see your nieces and nephews, learn how to just suck it up and deal. She's marrying him, you aren't.", "YTA.\n\nThis reads as \"I don't like sisBF therefore I can be a jerk to him, a golden opportunity to be a jerk to him occurred and I jumped at the chance.\"  It's not your place to judge who your sister dates, and it's not your place to jump down his throat in a party that you didn't have anything to do with directly.  Based on what you've written here, it's possible he had permission from your grandparents. \n\nIf anyone should have said anything it should have been your grandparents, not you.", "ESH except for your grandparents.  That was not the appropriate place for that to happen, but you are not the one to say that.  Also, clearing your throat? \n\nIf you are going to ruin a proposal, go big young man.  Sappy violin music from your phone, fake like you are crying with joy in a really obvious way.  Give a toast like \"Wow, dude used his authority as my sisters professor to get her to marry him, what a stud!!!!\"", "YTA that was not you responsibility. You had no idea if maybe the BF arranged this ahead of time.  Even if he didn't, not your place.  You need to work through your issues with this relationship, or just stay quiet.", "YTA. At the time, you didn't know if your grandparents had okayed the proposal. If they didn't, he was kinda rude but maybe wanted the whole family to be there for their special moment.\n\nBut regardless, it wasn't up to you to speak up and so rudely. Can't you even consider how much this guy loves your sister (tearing up is a big clue)? Also, his age isn't your business, their relationship is theirs. \n\nI hope you really think about how wrong you were to do this AND apologize to everyone: grands, sis & guy, and your parents. Do better or expect to excluded in future.", "YTA you made a slightly awkward situation 1000x worse", "ESH - except Grandma and Grandpa. I think this is definitely coming off as more, your not good enough for my sister. But I think it is a dick move to be so lazy or uncreative to try and steal an ANNIVERSARY for a proposal. Find your own way to show your love. Your Grandma and Grandpa where having a beautiful moment enjoying the lives they have lived together. Although I would LOVE to know what your parents and grandparents think of him proposing. I'm guessing they would have a better idea whether it was the right call or not.", "ESH- you aren't wrong that the bf was stealing your grandparents moment but that's a trainwreck that was already in motion. I'd be pissed at his stupidity and thoughtlessness,too, but at that point better he take the heat for his selfish cluelessness alone. You made yourself a magnet for it instead.", "Nta, I don't get what world all these yta are living in you cleared your throat at the stolen anniversary, you didn't talk down to them or yell. That was the real charmer your sister got herself seduced by , and really her college professor?  Next time lead with that. That power dynamic is very disturbing. I don't blame you for not liking him.", "YTA And quite ridiculous for doing this. You should apologize to everyone who was there. It\u2019s time to be an adult at all times. You\u2019re 26!", "YTA. Like, a massive AH. What you did is absolutely wild. Extremely nasty and cruel, and motivated by nastiness. You ruined their proposal and caused a scene because you don\u2019t like him, and you have no good reasons. If you actually cared about the event you wouldn\u2019t have made a scene by ruining a beautiful and pivotal moment. This was about you and the rotten thoughts and feelings in your mind. Self-reflect.", "ESH and you all should just never speak to each other again and move in different directions of whatever continent you\u2019re on. Then, in ten years you and your sister\u2019s bf fight and whoever wins after ten years of honing your strength can declare the other TA.", "YTA. If your sister was 18 and he was 28, yeah that age gap is a problem but she is 28 years old. She is a grown woman, has been an adult for a decade, has chosen him and is capable of choosing her partner. If you love your sister, why wouldn\u2019t you want her to be with someone who loves her so much they get visibly choked up about it?\n\nAlso unless she said no, that\u2019s not her boyfriend anymore, it\u2019s her fianc\u00e9. If you want her in your life you better work on your relationship with both of them and start by apologizing for your behavior not just in this instance but over the last few years.", "YTA - Not your place. You have an opinion but that doesn't make you right.", "NTA- he was in the wrong.  \n\nI would've loved to be there. I would've joined you in teasing the boyfriend. Cmon son. Only worse would be at a sporting event she doesn't even like.", "YTA.  C'mon, you've gotta know that was a dick move.", "Yeah, YTA. But I have a feeling that I would have done the same thing. So, how about YTA for saying something at that time, but NTA for thinking the way you do about the situation.", "ESH \u2014 Has your future BIL ever done you wrong for you to dislike him besides your own harbored bias that he\u2019s nine years older than your sister? Has he made other stupid decisions in the past aside from proposing during somebody else\u2019s special event?", "YTA- Cos she grown. She make her own decisions.", "ESH someone else's party or celebration is not the time to make it about oneself. Your (now) BIL made it about him and your sister, then you made it about you, even though you were kinda trying to do the right thing. Kinda also because you don't like him.\n\nRegarding the age difference, if they love each other, it's none of your business, so you're an AH for that also.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Grow up already. \n\nStop trying to run your sister's life.  Clearly, this guy loves her.  You don't have to like him, but you don't even know him.  Get over yourself and learn his personality.  If you decide then that you don't like him, fine, but you still need to keep your yap shut.  You are not dating/marrying him.  And an age difference of 11 years is not the big deal you are making it out to be.  You glommed on to the first concrete thing you could say that other people might agree with.  Whether or not the couple is compatible is important, and if they treat each other well.  Those are the only things that need to be considered.   If your sister feels pressured to be in a relationship, if he were controlling, that's different.  But you don't think that at all.... we readers can be confident of this because you would have said so in a big way.  Instead, you focus on this tiny thing that irritates you.  \n\nYes, OP, you ruined the party *and* you made your sister and her fianc\u00e9 mad. \nI feel sorry for your sister... and her soon-to-be husband... and the rest of your family. \n\nOP.....YTA... try to stop being one within the next 11 years.", "ESH.  Stealing the moment was an AH move on his part, and yelling at you for pointing that out was worse.  But it\u2019s not your circus, and not your monkeys.
