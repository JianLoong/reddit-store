I (26f) was invited to my grandparents\u2019 54th wedding anniversary along with the rest of my family. My (28f)sister brought along her (39m) boyfriend, which wasn\u2019t unusual as they\u2019ve been dating for three years now. I\u2019ve never liked him due to their large (imo) age difference. It\u2019s just always been really awkward being around him, which may be my fault as I\u2019ve been cold to him. Our parents don\u2019t seem to have any issues with him. Anyways, at their anniversary dinner my grandpa gave a speech about my grandma, which was really sweet. After his speech, my sister\u2019s boyfriend stood up and started tearing up and talking about how much he loved my sister. He then got down on one knee and proposed to her. I thought that this was really weird as it was my grandparents\u2019 anniversary dinner and it was supposed to be about them. I stood up and cleared my throat at them to try and send them the message that this was not the time or place. I know it probably wasn\u2019t up to me to say something, but I\u2019ve never liked my sister\u2019s boyfriend and thought this was a really inappropriate setting. My sister\u2019s boyfriend then started yelling at me saying that I was ruining their special moment. My sister just stood next to him with her arms crossed. No one else said anything and we left immediately after. I feel like I\u2019ve ruined my grandparents\u2019 anniversary and, on top of that, made my sister and her boyfriend mad at me. Our mom and dad have yet to say anything, and I can\u2019t stop thinking about how awkward the whole situation was.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: for those asking my sister\u2019s bf was her professor in college and that\u2019s why I initially didn\u2019t like him.", "created_utc": 1681783524, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12q6aiw/aita_for_ruining_my_sisters_boyfriends_proposal/", "score": 145, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She will be the one who has to live with the consequences of her actions, there's honestly nothing you can do about that.

Based on what you've written here, it's possible he had permission from your grandparents. \n\nIf anyone should have said anything it should have been your grandparents, not you.", "ESH except for your grandparents.  That was not the appropriate place for that to happen, but you are not the one to say that.  Also, clearing your throat? \n\nIf you are going to ruin a proposal, go big young man.  Sappy violin music from your phone, fake like you are crying with joy in a really obvious way.  Give a toast like \"Wow, dude used his authority as my sisters professor to get her to marry him, what a stud!!!!\"", "YTA that was not you responsibility.

At the time, you didn't know if your grandparents had okayed the proposal. If they didn't, he was kinda rude but maybe wanted the whole family to be there for their special moment.\n\nBut regardless, it wasn't up to you to speak up and so rudely. Can't you even consider how much this guy loves your sister (tearing up is a big clue)? Also, his age isn't your business, their relationship is theirs. \n\nI hope you really think about how wrong you were to do this AND apologize to everyone: grands, sis & guy, and your parents. Do better or expect to excluded in future.", "YTA you made a slightly awkward situation 1000x worse", "ESH - except Grandma and Grandpa. I think this is definitely coming off as more, your not good enough for my sister. But I think it is a dick move to be so lazy or uncreative to try and steal an ANNIVERSARY for a proposal. Find your own way to show your love. Your Grandma and Grandpa where having a beautiful moment enjoying the lives they have lived together. Although I would LOVE to know what your parents and grandparents think of him proposing. I'm guessing they would have a better idea whether it was the right call or not.", "ESH- you aren't wrong that the bf was stealing your grandparents moment but that's a trainwreck that was already in motion. I'd be pissed at his stupidity and thoughtlessness,too, but at that point better he take the heat for his selfish cluelessness alone. You made yourself a magnet for it instead.", "Nta, I don't get what world all these yta are living in you cleared your throat at the stolen anniversary, you didn't talk down to them or yell. That was the real charmer your sister got herself seduced by , and really her college professor?  Next time lead with that. That power dynamic is very disturbing. I don't blame you for not liking him.", "YTA And quite ridiculous for doing this. You should apologize to everyone who was there. It\u2019s time to be an adult at all times. You\u2019re 26!", "YTA. Like, a massive AH. What you did is absolutely wild. Extremely nasty and cruel, and motivated by nastiness. You ruined their proposal and caused a scene because you don\u2019t like him, and you have no good reasons. If you actually cared about the event you wouldn\u2019t have made a scene by ruining a beautiful and pivotal moment. This was about you and the rotten thoughts and feelings in your mind. Self-reflect.", "ESH and you all should just never speak to each other again and move in different directions of whatever continent you\u2019re on. Then, in ten years you and your sister\u2019s bf fight and whoever wins after ten years of honing your strength can declare the other TA.", "YTA. If your sister was 18 and he was 28, yeah that age gap is a problem but she is 28 years old. She is a grown woman, has been an adult for a decade, has chosen him and is capable of choosing her partner. If you love your sister, why wouldn\u2019t you want her to be with someone who loves her so much they get visibly choked up about it?\n\nAlso unless she said no, that\u2019s not her boyfriend anymore, it\u2019s her fianc\u00e9.

You have an opinion but that doesn't make you right.", "NTA- he was in the wrong.  \n\nI would've loved to be there. I would've joined you in teasing the boyfriend. Cmon son. Only worse would be at a sporting event she doesn't even like.", "YTA.  C'mon, you've gotta know that was a dick move.", "Yeah, YTA. But I have a feeling that I would have done the same thing. So, how about YTA for saying something at that time, but NTA for thinking the way you do about the situation.", "ESH \u2014 Has your future BIL ever done you wrong for you to dislike him besides your own harbored bias that he\u2019s nine years older than your sister?

She make her own decisions.", "ESH someone else's party or celebration is not the time to make it about oneself. Your (now) BIL made it about him and your sister, then you made it about you, even though you were kinda trying to do the right thing.

Grow up already. \n\nStop trying to run your sister's life.  Clearly, this guy loves her.  You don't have to like him, but you don't even know him.  Get over yourself and learn his personality.  If you decide then that you don't like him, fine, but you still need to keep your yap shut.  You are not dating/marrying him.  And an age difference of 11 years is not the big deal you are making it out to be.  You glommed on to the first concrete thing you could say that other people might agree with.  Whether or not the couple is compatible is important, and if they treat each other well.  Those are the only things that need to be considered.   If your sister feels pressured to be in a relationship, if he were controlling, that's different.

You\u2019re free to dislike someone. And  if the proposal wasn\u2019t green-lit, BF was totally gauche \u2014 and made it all worse by yelling at you?!? Bizarre.

Everyone here seems to be thinking you did something wrong - well, a little, but this dude turned out to be an even bigger AH than he already was.\n\nIt was someone else's celebration, which he hijacked for his own purposes. It is never cool to use someone else's occasion for a proposal.  Its cheap and tacky, especially after your grandfather made a sweet speech about his wife.   \nClearing your throat was not saying anything, and this guy then yelling at you made this a bigger scene.  At least it wasn't someone else's wedding I suppose.\n\nOn the other hand, most people would have already thought it was not the moment to propose.  You just  drew more attention away from the anniversary and pulled the spotlight onto yourself.  So you are partly to blame for this unnecessary carry on.  As for the possible inappropriateness of a college prof dating a student, that is not your problem.", "YTA - that\u2019s actually a really thoughtful and meaningful time to propose", "YTA", "Just an FYI, my daughter\u2019s fianc\u00e9 is 11 years older than her. Maturity wise, they are on the same page. It could be the same for your sister. And from what you wrote, it sounds like it is the same thing.

Regardless of your feelings it's not your place. Unless you know for a fact he didn't get permission you can't say he was in the wrong. If he didn't he was an asshole. However, he may have asked for permission. Furthermore, that is not a terrible age gap. \ud83d\ude44 My husband and I have 8 years. For consulting adults it's not a big deal. Regardless you are very wrong for your behavior. He may be a great guy but because he is like 10(?) years older and was a teacher you're tripping? You're being extremely judgmental. Give the man a chance unless you have a valid reason not to. Otherwise, sister or not stay out of it unless you want to destroy whatever relationship you still have with your sister.", "NTA because I wish more people would do this when people try to steal other people's moments or events for their proposals and baby announcements.

Like a normal person!", "I would like to know OPs primary motive. Is it because bf did it at someone else's event or because OP doesn't like him. Would OP be doing the same thing if there wasn't large age gap or she liked the bf.\n\nSo far I'm seeing OP did it because she doesn't like the bf.", "clearing your throat isn't 'wild'........yelling at her was wild - the dude could have just ignored her and carried on, which would have made her look foolish - instead, he made it worse.  two people did stupid things - they are both AHs.", "Well sister wasn't shutting it down. I know if my siblings did anything like this would be embarassed. Then again most of my family aren't spot light lovers...... I'm also 1 of 5 so we aren't used to it", "I mean she stopped him when he was literally on one knee in front of everyone, pretty wild. She admits to treating him \u201ccold\u201d as long as she\u2019s known him which probably means nasty based on what we know about her.

OP should have expressed her concern *one time* and left it at that and instead, three years later she\u2019s still doing the most to drive a wedge between herself and her sister.
