I (26f) was invited to my grandparents\u2019 54th wedding anniversary along with the rest of my family. My (28f)sister brought along her (39m) boyfriend, which wasn\u2019t unusual as they\u2019ve been dating for three years now. I\u2019ve never liked him due to their large (imo) age difference. It\u2019s just always been really awkward being around him, which may be my fault as I\u2019ve been cold to him. Our parents don\u2019t seem to have any issues with him. Anyways, at their anniversary dinner my grandpa gave a speech about my grandma, which was really sweet. After his speech, my sister\u2019s boyfriend stood up and started tearing up and talking about how much he loved my sister. He then got down on one knee and proposed to her. I thought that this was really weird as it was my grandparents\u2019 anniversary dinner and it was supposed to be about them. I stood up and cleared my throat at them to try and send them the message that this was not the time or place. I know it probably wasn\u2019t up to me to say something, but I\u2019ve never liked my sister\u2019s boyfriend and thought this was a really inappropriate setting. My sister\u2019s boyfriend then started yelling at me saying that I was ruining their special moment. My sister just stood next to him with her arms crossed. No one else said anything and we left immediately after. I feel like I\u2019ve ruined my grandparents\u2019 anniversary and, on top of that, made my sister and her boyfriend mad at me. Our mom and dad have yet to say anything, and I can\u2019t stop thinking about how awkward the whole situation was.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: for those asking my sister\u2019s bf was her professor in college and that\u2019s why I initially didn\u2019t like him.\n\nEDIT 2: Sorry for not posting this edit earlier. This morning my grandma sent out an email to everyone who attended their anniversary celebration. She said that the proposal had not been pre-approved by her and my grandfather, but that she hoped we could all move past such an awkward situation. She also left me a voicemail saying that she understood why I did what I did, and that she agrees with me, but in the future she would like to pass judgement at her own events. Thank you for everyone that commented, I understand that I was in the wrong here. I\u2019m currently at work right now, but if anything else comes up I\u2019ll update here. As for my sister and her boyfriend (not fianc\u00e9), they aren\u2019t engaged. Her boyfriend took back his proposal and claimed that he was drunk when he proposed. That might make more sense as to why he yelled at me.", "created_utc": 1681783524, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12q6aiw/aita_for_ruining_my_sisters_boyfriends_proposal/", "score": 2290, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Lol", "right!! i don\u2019t think it\u2019s an issue at all as long as there\u2019s nothing weird going on. and lol i agree!! it\u2019s kind of sweet he didn\u2019t that!! congratulations on the 22 years \u2665\ufe0f", "I mean it looks like they started dating a couple of years later after she finished collage? We don't know if anything even happened when he was her professor. Also while 25 and 36 is an age gap for sure, sister was a developed adult at this point and it's none of OP's business.", "Exactly. But in that moment OP didn't know one way or another. As a Brit your reaction in that situation is to sit awkwardly, quietly panic and wait for the most grown up grown up of the group to decide the reaction to the situation. OP was not the adultiest adult there. Not her call to make.", "Again, in your hatred for \u2018tacky\u2019, \u2018hijacked\u2019 celebrations, you\u2019re missing a key factor here - consent of the hosts. If the hosts consent, then what\u2019s the problem?\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to find it tacky, but it\u2019s another to simply assume it was a \u2018hijack\u2019! Maybe it wasn\u2019t! And if it wasn\u2019t, then OP\u2019s reaction was completely out of line. And even if it was a hijack, what OP did was still inappropriate because she ended up creating a scene anyway! How was what she did different from what she so haughtily claims her sister\u2019s boyfriend did? In fact, thanks to OP, now two couples are embarrassed instead of just one!\n\nI get that you find it tacky! But not everyone feels  that way! We don\u2019t know yet if the grandparents consented or not. But saying their consent doesn\u2019t matter because TaCkY is in itself quite disrespectful!", "How many accounts have you had banned from this sub?", "Let's be real here, OP cleared her throat, if anyone is to blame about creating a scene it's bf he could've ignored it. He's the one that made people uncomfortable, and don't pretend that he most likely did. But go on with it's ok because he had permission from the hosts, which might have not been the grandparents in the first place, and choosing that moment to confront OP and her dislike of him. There were more than just two couples embarrassed after that.", "Macron?", "O shut up. Students aren't off limits if they're in college and beyond. With the future leaning towards most people being students and employees in their lives, where do you think people are going to meet each other? The bus stop?", "I became a mother at 20. Oops? Had my second at 26 but at least they'll be out of my hair when I'm in my 40s lmao", "And how did he make people comfortable?!", "Reading the OP again, I do believe she was his student. Just an older student. University students can be any age.\n\nBut if OP has stated elsewhere that there was a few years in between the teaching and the relationship, I'm happy to be corrected.", "the university I work at, and many others, have policies prohibiting relationships between students and faculty, even graduate students and faculty. There is a power dynamic that can be abused, and entering into a relationship with a student could end up with the faculty being terminated from their position. Also it's creepy to date your students, past or present .", "There are many many places to meet someone. Heck, lots of people meet someone while in class! But your professor should be off limits. Any time you are in a position of institutional power over someone, it is an asshole move to date them (And will get you fired in many places to boot). Do not date your subordinates. Do not date your students. If you are any kind of doctor, do not date your patients.\n\nIt's really not that hard and in fact considered basic ethics in a lot of professions. It has nothing to do with age (university students can be any age!), but institutional power.", ">Students aren't off limits if they're in college and beyond.\n\nThey most certainly are, explicitly so. Imablanced power dynamics, conflict of interest, ethics violations abound plus lots more. Is it really that hard to not fuck people under your position of power? Of all the people in the world....gimme a break.", "Good question, how did he make a room full of his future family comfortable after that?", "NTA. Grandma has spoken. She didn't approve.\n\nAlso, lol to your sister's bf taking back the proposal. Being drunk is not an excuse to be an AH. I can imagine your sister dying in embarassment rn.", "ESH. But not as much for you as your sister's BF. Sure, you ruined his unapproved moment. But he yelled at you during a family event--YOUR family. What the heck was he thinking? He's 39 years old, way past the age of throwing a tantrum in public, especially since he was not creative enough to think of his own special proposal, so he decided to rip off someone else's. He should be embarrassed.\n\nIMO, your dislike for him doesn't matter. His behavior spoke for itself. And what was his excuse? \"Oh I was drunk hur dur.\" Wtf? \ud83d\ude02\n\nHonestly, I think what you did was rude, but imagining it in my head made me laugh a bit. I guess I have a bit of an AH side.", "YTA, you are right that it wasn't up to you to say something", "Huge huge huge huge huge huge huge huge huge huge huge huge huge huge huge huge huge huge huge huge huge huge huge hugehuge huge huge huge huge huge huge huge huge huge huge huge huge huge hugehuge huge huge huge huge huge huge huge huge huge huge huge huge huge hugehuge huge huge huge huge huge huge huge huge huge huge huge huge huge hugehuge huge huge huge huge huge huge huge huge huge huge huge huge huge hugehuge huge huge huge huge huge huge huge YTA. .\n\nDon't know how you cannot see that.", "YTA but I get it it happens. But wait\u2026he took back his proposal?!?! Because he was drunk?! Wow\u2026", "YTA and you know it:\n\n> I feel like I\u2019ve ruined my grandparents\u2019 anniversary and, on top of that, made my sister and her boyfriend mad at me. Our mom and dad have yet to say anything, and I can\u2019t stop thinking about how awkward the whole situation was.\n\nWhy are you even asking the Internet?", "Wow - he *took back his proposal*??  Oh, my. If we are looking for TAH - then \\*ding \\*ding - we found one!!\n\nYour grandmother's email note and voicemail was very nice.", "NTA. God, I hate it when an asshole choose other person's special day to make a proposal. It's ridiculous.", "NTA. I believe it adds a bit more to why you disliked the brother for being her prof on top of the age gap. You sounded like you were looking out. That\u2019s an inappropriate relationship to me. I just read a post where someone basically did what you did but at a wedding. It\u2019s rude, tacky, and disrespectful to try to do big announcements at events where someone else is the center especially without permission. I mean even the grandma agreed with the action, but preferred for her/them to handle it. I get that. \n\nImagine calling you an attention stealer when you were calling out people who stole attention. \n\nNot to even he was drunk and took it back!? Come on.  Don\u2019t sweat it. NTA.", "ESH. I suspect that you objected to the proposal more because you disapprove of the relationship than it being at grandparents\u2019 event, and also making the night awkward so that\u2019s why Y T A. Boyfriend is also the A H for doing that without authorization from your grandparents and proposing while drunk. And depending on whether or not your sister was his student at the time also might make him the A H because you shouldn\u2019t date someone when there\u2019s an unequal power dynamic.", "NTA.  Someone taking over another person's event to make it into their own event is really selfish and inappropriate.", "op edited it to add their reaction\n\n>EDIT 2: Sorry for not posting this edit earlier. This morning my grandma sent out an email to everyone who attended their anniversary celebration. She said that the proposal had not been pre-approved by her and my grandfather, but that she hoped we could all move past such an awkward situation. She also left me a voicemail saying that she understood why I did what I did, and that she agrees with me, but in the future she would like to pass judgement at her own events. Thank you for everyone that commented, I understand that I was in the wrong here. I\u2019m currently at work right now, but if anything else comes up I\u2019ll update here. As for my sister and her boyfriend (not fianc\u00e9), they aren\u2019t engaged. Her boyfriend took back his proposal and claimed that he was drunk when he proposed. That might make more sense as to why he yelled at me.", "Is 54th some kind of special anniversary?", "The edit says there was no approval to do the proposal and he actually rescinded his proposal later \"cause he was drunk\". I think with this Info, OP is NTa.", "If you don\u2019t know the answer before hand- you shouldn\u2019t be proposing. That\u2019s regardless of it being public or not.", "op edited it to add context\n\n>EDIT 2: Sorry for not posting this edit earlier.

But it seems like a long time to be married and both partners are still alive to celebrate it together.", "theres an 11 years age gap and if he was her professor before they dated its freaking weird. \n\nhe probably met her at 22-24 and he was 33-35, thats a HUGE difference of maturities", "For sure, also if he was late twenties/early thirties for most disciplines it would make a lot more sense if he was just a TA. At least in engineering I\u2019ve never seen a graduate professor that young", "I think we need more context on if he was just a TA or a research lead. She would be in the PhD age range and he would be heavily on the younger side for most PhD teaching positions. From how OP wrote this I wouldn\u2019t be stunned if he was just a TA or GTA and OP wanted something to get people to agree with her. IMO dating a professor is weird, but a TA isn\u2019t at all as they\u2019re basically peers. Granted I can only speak on how it works in engineering because that\u2019s what I did", "This!! The more grown up grown ups decide and everyone else sits silently until afterwards when you slyly bring it up in conversation and gauge the reaction of your audience. Like normal people.", "Really, because my cousin married her's and they have been married for over 40 years.. 25 isn't your childhood..  Your a adult", ">from your childhood\n\nhe was her college professor", "Speaking as a college professor, I for one find it really creepy when college professors date their students, even when they are their recently ex students."]}
