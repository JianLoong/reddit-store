Every two weeks or so, they\u2019re all cleaned up, then the buildup begins again. \n\nI didn\u2019t know for sure it was the daughter until I decided to go out and wait under the balcony one night.

They\u2019re out on the balcony smoking, up until 2-3 in the morning. I can\u2019t get any sleep. \n\nUnder normal circumstances, they would\u2019ve been out of here weeks ago. However, I know they\u2019ve been having financial troubles trying to cover the wife\u2019s medical bills and chemo, and evicting them would cause stress this family doesn\u2019t need. But does that mean I have to sacrifice my own well-being and tolerate littering on my property? Not to mention the child is 17, she should be able to manage a sick family member.

This isn\u2019t a \u201csick family member,\u201d this is a CHILD\u2019S DYING MOTHER. That\u2019s not easy to deal with at any age, but especially for one so young.", "INFO have you tried talking to them first? All I'm getting from this post is that you want to evict a family for something they might not even know they're doing wrong.

She shouldn't be acting out and should know better at 17? Her mom is DYING. She is a teenager. Teenagers act out when under stress and dealing with grief. Heck, adults do that. \n\nYou need to speak with them directly and ask for some reasonable rules to be put in place. Are there quiet hours in the lease? Rules about smoking?", "More info needed. Have you tried to discuss it with the father (who I assume is the main bread winner and is one of the people who's credit got them into the apartment)? Maybe he's totally unaware that she's doing this?

If not YWBTA", "INFO I need from you and some for you (You haven't done it yet but you will be one if you do, especially without warning.)\n\nAlso, let me enlighten you on something as both someone with kids who's had cancer and someone who was 26 when my dad died after several years of fighting cancer and I can tell you there is no cut-off age for losing one's shit because a parent is deathly ill, min or max. I survived, luckily, but my kids still carry it 8 years on, and my dad's death messed me up big time as I was partly also taking care of him.\n\n17 is... My god. So young to watch her mum go through something like this. Possibly the worst age. Not an adult yet and helpless to do anything about it even if she was... No, she shouldn't \"be able to manage by now\", especially if the diagnosis is relatively recent.\n\nNow my questions:\nHave you actually spoken to the family and tried to resolve this in some way? If not, are you planning to?\n\nIs smoking allowed in the apartment? I live in a country where that's not really regulated and it's not really a thing for landlords to make it a condition of living there.\n\nIf not, would you be willing to make an exception because of the circumstances?\n\nIt's possible the daughter is the only one responsible, but have you considered that the weed is for the very sick woman because it alleviates some of the pain and helps open up the appetite (this is info I was given off the record by my doctors when I was sick but I couldn't use it because literally everything made me nauseous)? Would that change anything for you?\n\nI mean... I don't know, if I was in your position I'd speak to them to see what the actual situation is and probably just ask them to make sure they throw the butts in the regular trash because throwing them off the balcony is definitely not ok. I wouldn't want to be in your shoes, tbh.", "YTA, learn some conflict resolution skills, I'd love to know if you actually approached them about this.", "I\u2019m leaning towards YTA on the basis that you think a 17 year old should be able to deal with the death of her mother. I don\u2019t think there is a minimum age on being ok with that. \n\nOther than standing under the balcony to watch the littering what have you done to resolve the issue. Have you spoke to the about the litter? The noise at unsociable hours? Given them a warning. You would definitely be the AH if you evict them without giving them the chance to resolve things. If you have spoken to them and nothings improved then you would not", "YWBTA if you haven\u2019t initiated multiple conversations and confrontations before reaching the point of eviction. \n\nYWNBTA if you have had these conversations and confrontations and the behavior has continued without change. \n\nDefinitely a fragile situation because I can see where you\u2019re coming from. You don\u2019t want litter on your property, or parties consistently where you can assume minors are consuming drugs and alcohol. However I do think evicting a terminally ill person is morally wrong unless the situation is dire. I think you would be in the right to evict if you have an adult conversation with all involved and the delinquent behavior continued.", "a 17 year old CHILD \"should be able to handle\" her mother dying? YTA just for that.", "She should know better? She\u2019s 17 with her mom dying, of course she\u2019s acting out. \nWhy can\u2019t you just have a conversation with them explaining the issue of loud guests after a certain time and no smoking or dumping outside?", "YTA . how the fuck were you expecting a 17 year old to handle her mother being temrinally ill WELL ???? have a talk with her about littering and keeping the noise down , but have some symptathy for fucks sake . shes going through something unimaginabley traumatic . wouldnt you want someone to care if you were in the same situation ?", "YTA. You didn\u2019t say if you\u2019ve actually approached them about the issue. And 17 is a kid. Yeah, a 17yo is going to act out when her mother is dying. But that\u2019s not even relevant to the issue; it sounds like the parents have no idea there\u2019s anything going on and you are just going to surprise evict a dying woman and her family. Just communicate ffs", "Yeh, sorry, YWBTA.  But not like OVER the top one.  I would talk to the family and let them know how you feel and about what is going on.  If you are the owner, let them know you are within your rights to evict and YOU don't what to do that.  But, talk to them.", "I'm only going with YTA because you haven't mentioned bringing the problem up with them at all. You're going straight into eviction for something, while gross, is mostly harmless to your yard rather than talking to them", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She may be 17 but do think she may be coping with the fact her mother is slowly dying in front of her eyes.
