Yuck.", "YTA\n\nNo reason to chastise her for saving her money. I'd recommend she use a collapsible hanger for them, as its way more tidy but to each their own. \n\nBut air-dry your damn clothes.\n\nYou want your shirts to last 2-3x longer? Air-dry them. A collapsible stand is like 40 bucks at walmart and will save you hundreds per year on the electric bill AND will make your clothing last longer.   \n(I use it for shirts/pants/jeans)", "YTA, drying clothes in a dryer is expensive. Air drying is free. \nThis is how she has no debt and can afford to have things she wants. You sound tiring.", "YTA. Air drying clothes is perfectly normal. Just because she could afford to use the dryer doesn't mean she can't also want to be economical and better for the environment.", "air drying is actually quite common.\n\nYTA but only because she gave you a reason why and you didn't accept it. She's fine air drying her clothes so let her be.  I am sure the jokes at first were fine but after a while its sucks and is annoying", "YTA.  Why do you even care?  She is conserving electricity.  It's not a bad thing.", "YTA.\n\nAmerican by any chance?\n\nLiterally nowhere on earth is so dryer dependent.\n\nAir drying clothes is so normal in so many countries.\n\nMy stuff was out on the washing line today. And yes, we have a dryer.\n\nUsing the dryer, to me, is last resort when the weather fails you.\n\nCheck your attitude and let your girlfriend live her life how she wants.", "YTA.   \nYou save money by not spending money. She can afford to use her dryer but then wouldn't have as much saved. It's a simple concept.  \n\n\nIf you're so bothered by how she hangs her clothes, purchase a drying rack for her birthday or something.", "Not only is it cheaper it also stops clothes from shrinking. Tumble drying clothes is totally unnecessary. YTA.", "YTA. It sounds like she has a very good sense of how to save on things that aren\u2019t important to her so that she can splurge on things that are. That\u2019s called being financially smart and not at all a flaw.", "YTA. Get a hobby or something! What she does with her laundry in her apartment is no business of yours. Teasing her is childish and rude. Seriously, grow up!", "YTA. Not only is it cheaper to hang-dry clothing, a lot of women's clothing tags say \"hand wash, hang-dry only\" and while most women are still willing to throw them into the washer despite that, the hang-drying can make a difference in the life of the piece.", "Not sure why you're acting like 58,000/year is a ton of money.  She's clearly found a budgeting system that works for her.  You sound insecure about how well she manages her spending habits.  Drop it.

Even if she made three times as much money, she may not want to use the dryer all the time to cut back on electric in an effort to be eco friendly.

I tried to ensure I could get it down so I could have money for other things. \n\nI'm in a 900 sq ft now with my own washer and dryer and it's at 130 which to me is a lot and it's because of the washer and dryer.", "Yta leave her alone. What she is doing is normal for some people", "YtA....58,000 a year is only about 30ish k after taxes and your clothes last WAY longer when you don't put them in the dryer.   PS.  Most of the world doesn't use dryers", "YTA. She has her financial priorities.  It's not affecting you other than having to deal with the \"trauma\" of seeing her clean clothes laid out to dry, so why do you have to tease her about it?", "Air drying and putting on a sweater are responsible things to do, just like paying off debt and living within one\u2019s means. \n\nNot only that, but it\u2019s more environmentally friendly. \n\nJust because one can afford to waste money and electricity doesn\u2019t mean one should. \n\nMild yta if you\u2019re really just teasing and you stop for good now that you know it irritates her. You should probably examine your own behaviors though. I imagine you waste a lot of things and she\u2019s too polite to point it out.", "YTA. Air drying is normal. I airdry and own a rack to hang my laundry on. \n\nWhat I don't own is a dryer. They're pointless imo. And a waste of money. You might disagree. And that's fine. You know why? They are just opinions. You just think yours is superior.", "YTA. I air dry my clothes because dryers can be damaging to them. But for whatever reason, it\u2019s the way people did it pre the mid to late last century. There\u2019s more important things", "YTA. Your gf is careful with her finances and it's paying off well for her. She spends money on things that are important to her and saves money when she can. This is smart, not weird. My husband and I have always been the same way with our money and being careful made it so we could retire early. Learn from your gf instead of making fun of her.", "I airdry clothes throughout the year (summer it's on the line outside, rest of the year I have a rack) especially heavy towels. It's just not worth the power. YTA. It's not about affording, it's what she is choosing to spend money on. She is fine to airdry. It's none of your business otherwise.", "YTA. I grew up with a laundry line, it's fine. You pay her power bill.", "You know dryers are actually pretty hard on clothes?  It's better for their longevity to air dry them.\n\nYou need to step off.  If she wants to save money more than she wants that convenience that's her business.  The main point here is that you're making her feel bad about something that doesn't matter, just because it seems unusual to you.  YTA", "YTA for your attitude. You don\u2019t know everything better than her. It doesn\u2019t matter why she does it, she probably has it figured out, and even if she didn\u2019t have a \u201creason\u201d, the male saviour complex was old 10 years ago. Grow up and learn to be an actual partner instead of trying to one up your gf.", "YTA \n\nMind your own damm business and you won't have issues", "YTA\n\nYou probably shouldn't be with some you're so jealous and resentful of.", "YTA She\u2019s seems happy doing this and doesn\u2019t need to justify it to you. My sister is very thrifty and does a lot of stuff that I personally wouldn\u2019t do to save money, but she wants to do those things. It\u2019s not my business and it\u2019s a more eco-friendly way to live so I don\u2019t harass her.", "YTA.  It\u2019s shitty to shame someone you love about something they take seriously, which it\u2019s clear with money management, she does.  \n\nIt also sounds like she cares about environmental responsibility (investment in quality, ethically sourced natural fiber clothing.) Air drying is a great way to prolong the life of her wardrobe - again, very financially responsible and eco friendly!\n\nAs I\u2019m sure many will tell you, much of the world line dries and it\u2019s just a weird, stupid thing to mock someone over.  Your girlfriend is making choices that align really well with admirable modern values.  Learn something from her example.", "YTA this is really common back in the U.K. and most people chose to air dry clothes when able. Most gardens have a rotary line in them. It\u2019s her choice to 1) save money 2) help the planet a little. You can extend the life of clothes by not putting them in the dryer, especially things with Lycra and elastic in them. Why not go buy her a clothes drying rack ? I have to admit I do like my towels to be dried in the dryer", "YTA.\n\nSo I\u2019m sure the comments have fully covered all the ways air drying clothes is normal and not just saves on electricity but also keeps the clothing in better shape.\n\nTherefore, I will send my time pointing out that it isn\u2019t a joke or \u201cteasing\u201d when you repeatedly bring up something that actually bothers you, that\u2019s just passive aggressive toxic behavior. How she saves money and dries her clothes actually bothers you, so you aren\u2019t \u201cteasing\u201d her, you are trying to point out behavior you don\u2019t agree with and want her to change or admit isn\u2019t normal. This isn\u2019t how healthy people exist in the world.\n\nHere is an example. Let\u2019s say your partner always leaves one bite of food on the plate, who knows why. Teasing is \u201coh one bite is left, time for the check!\u201d Judging is \u201coh there\u2019s sally not caring about the starving kids! You are doing the latter, not the former.\n\nYou aren\u2019t teasing her, because it\u2019s clear there is an underlying judgment. You may think your partner - who has no debt, a good job, and a degree- isn\u2019t smart enough to get that you aren\u2019t engaging in playing teasing but are in fact being rude, but clearly she is smart enough. I mean, besides dating you, she seems to be doing well.", "YTA. Since you\u2019re so down to spend money without any thoughts of being frugal, why don\u2019t you just send me some free money??", "YTA\n\nIf you want to not be TA, maybe buy her a folding drying rack. \n\nPeople are allowed to spend THEIR OWN MONEY as they see fit. \n\nIt's up to her, end of story.", "YTA. Being able to afford to do something should never be the main reason you do anything. She may also just not want to waste energy, because yano, global warming? You've heard of that right? \n\nIt's also worth mentioning that she might have to make sacrifices in some of the other things she \"splurges\" on if she wasted money on electricity. I used the dryer more often than not, and it's purely because I'm lazy. \n\nTeasing is okay to a point, but if it goes to the point that your partner gets really upset, we'll it's pretty obvious you've gone too far.", "Are you planning on paying her bills for her?  No?  Then stop making comments about it.\n\nYTA", "YTA. Buy her a nice folding dryer rack.", "You\u2019d hate me. I don\u2019t even *own* a dryer. All clothes are air dried. I also don\u2019t really put heating on unless I have to. If I get cold I put a jumper on, chuck a throw over my lap etc. \n\nWhy? Because it\u2019s cheaper and so much better for the environment. I don\u2019t get the fascination with machine drying clothes or pumping the heating up when a sweater will do the job. \n\nYTA.", "OP, I air-dry most of my clothes and only use the dryer for towels and a few things on and off.

That is everything you need to know to stop doing it. If you keep teasing her, knowing she is bothered by it, YTA.\n\nEDIT: If she wants to dry her clothes in that way to save electricity, that's her right. I'll be honest, as a way to save money, I find that habit as strange as you do. But it doesn't matter what we think. It's *her* decision, it doesn't harm anyone, so we should respect it. You've had your fun mocking her, now give it a rest.", "If you had a damned brain in your head you will no get  her a clothes drying rack and line and help her run the line in a room .. that way all her drying is more or less in one place \ud83d\ude44", "YTA\nYou know there are a lot of people who does this air drying or sundrying? \nLike we don't a dryer, we hang our clothes either at the roof or the yard so they dry out.

And why risk damaging my clothes? Air drying keeps them looking new longer", "YTA, you're basically just mad at her for living within her means.", "YTA. Nutritionist and organic products?

It\u2019s not cute. It\u2019s not affectionate. And if it\u2019s What You Do, don\u2019t. I personally think thst what your girlfriend does is silly, but it\u2019s not my clothes, my money, or my dryer. Leave it alone.", "I get it. That would drive me nuts, too. I'd say yta on the teasing bit. That said,  if you guys move in together, she'll likely keep doing it and you'll need to decide how much it bugs you.", "NTA\n\nShe doesn't seem to understand the cost of the time and energy she puts into not using the drier and, to a lesser extent, lowering the heat. If her time has such a low value that she can invest it hanging clothes for less than minimum wage in her free time, she may want to consider investing that time into herself.", "NAH. She's decided where she wants to spend her money and you find it worth teasing about. And honestly, if I walked into someone's apartment and saw clothes and towels hanging or haphazardly strewn about the floor, I'd probably tease them about it, too.\n\nThe trick is not to overdo it and not to do it if she's had a particularly long day. \n\nMy advice is to read the room (heh heh).", "Nta.
