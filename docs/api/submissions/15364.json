It was 8am and I booked a ride to school, I give my usual greetings and prepare to put my headphones in. My driver sees that my destination is a college and asks if I'm a student, I nod and get my headphones on. This is how I shut down conversations and it usually works, people who are my age tend to respect it but older drivers occasionally look at me funny for doing it. Anyway, the driver sees me put my headphones on before he starts driving but still proceeds to talk to me. I hear him ask \"what are you studying\" but I've already indicated my disinterest in conversation so I turn my music up again. A few minutes later he asks me again, louder this time. I'm not in the mood so I ignore him again. He asks again, practically yelling so I take off my headphones and say \"nursing.\" In a flat, annoyed tone. He makes a few more comments but my music is back up at this point. At the end of the ride when I thank him for dropping me off, he doesn't unlock his car and says something along the lines of \"you were very rude ma'am\". I got mad at him and I told him that \"I made it clear I didn't want to talk, I wasn't being rude you were being annoying\". Then I gave him two stars in the car. I felt like a bitch for saying it, but he let me out and told me to have a nice day. I told my partner what happened and she said my reaction was completely fine, but all of my friends called me an asshole for calling him annoying and lowering his rating, one of them told me my refusal to talk to him was stuck up and he was just trying to be nice. AITA?\n\nEdit:\nResponding kinda fast but I caught on to where I went wrong a few comments in and I'm definitely the asshole here. I still think the driver was a bit pushy and should have let me out of his car immediately instead of locking the door at the end, but I can't be mad at him for crossing a boundary I didn't set correctly. I don't really like to talk to people and set those types of boundaries because I don't want to come off the wrong way, but I came off even worse by not just saying at the beginning that I wasn't really up to talking. I realized that not wanting to talk wasn't what he was annoyed about, it was my reaction and lack of communication that made me rude. Next time, I start the ride by letting the driver know I don't feel like talking.", "created_utc": 1682106924, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ug6uo/aita_for_giving_my_uber_driver_2_stars_and/", "score": 356, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He called me rude and I stated in my post that I felt like a bitch. However you are right about me being a girl, and he addressed me as ma'am.", "you'd be surprised.

The old boy isn't doing her a favour she's paying him.....", "The guy didn't take the hint of putting on headphones and being ignored twice......

I wasn't gonna rate at all until he locked me in.", "That. Never. Works. They just switch to either bugging you about \"What's wrong?\" or telling their life story.", "I don't think OP is TA. I think the driver was. But, I do think that being polite isn't a big deal. OP did not force the driver to become rude and hostile.

That makes perfect sense.", "Well she is an 18yo female so she did exactly as you would expect her to", "But in this case you are being paid to drive, not conversate.

If someone clearly doesn't and you take it personally... maybe you shouldn't be driving people.", "The difference is her JOB will be to take care of and talk to patients.

Please report him to Uber. He locked the doors and wouldn\u2019t let you out!?! Hell no! That\u2019s f-cking psychotic and threatening. You do not owe anyone, even someone providing a service, a conversation. He TRAPPED YOU IN A CAR to what, teach you a lesson, show you your place? What if he decided you didn\u2019t deserve to be dropped off where you wanted to be? What if he just took off with you still in the car and left you stranded somewhere because you were \u201cuppity\u201d?\n\nPeople are saying you were rude for not engaging in conversation, but again, YOU DON\u2019T OWE ANYONE A CONVERSATION! You denied him your attention, that doesn\u2019t give him the right to HOLD YOU HOSTAGE while he lectures you. My vote is NTA.", "Technically, it's false/unlawful imprisonment, not attempted kidnapping.", "I mean it's not like Uber has a history of this...wait, what? Oh, so much history of this? Wow, it's almost like having no regulation is a recipe for disaster", "Yeah. He never would have done that to a man that ignored him.  You did absolutely nothing wrong. He was absolutely not trying to be nice. He wanted to talk cause HE likes to talk. He doesn\u2019t care what you wanted.

I don\u2019t like talking to strangers. I still have men trying to chat at me when I have my air pods in. Earlier today, riding in the elevator in my hotel, and a guy starts motioning to my t shirt and saying something. I just pointed to my AirPods and ignored him.

I didn\u2019t say she had to sit there and chit chat, I said respond to the direct question and let them know you are tired and uninterested in conversation instead of turning up your headphones and treating other humans like they have a mute button. The man driving you isn\u2019t a robot and doesn\u2019t deserve to be treated like one. Don\u2019t want human interaction with your driver?

It's common decency when it comes to strangers.", "If you\u2019ve got to yell a question to get an answer any normal person would realize they\u2019re not interested in talking to you.", "Why do you act like getting into an uber driver\u2019s car and having them drive you to your destination is some act of niceness? It\u2019s their job. OP was nice by greeting him. In the end of the ride she said thank you. This is basic niceness.\n\nI get it, people aren\u2019t robots. I\u2019m working as a tour guide and I actually have to talk to people. That\u2019s my job. Never do I ever ask them personal questions unless they tell me this themselves. \n\nAlso, a woman taking a solo uber ride isn\u2019t as safe as it sounds. Look at all the SA cases. Back in 2017\u20132018 when the whole thing wasn\u2019t as regulated as today I\u2019d get unsolicited comments on my appearance from the uber drivers or listen to them talking about how many women they fucked. Literally. Some women don\u2019t want to engage in those conversations at all which is understandable!", "Context matters?\n\nAnd she did greet him, and said thank you. I'm a man and that's all the interaction a taxi driver would expect off me.....

And obviously you do think he\u2019s entitled to a conversation because you\u2019re telling her that she should have just sucked it up and talked to him. I hope you\u2019re single because yikes. I also do not like talking to people but on the job I put up with it because it\u2019s my job.

Not trying to argue btw, just thought it was an interesting discussion", "I\u2019m not acting like it\u2019s out of niceness.

That\u2019s all it takes, it\u2019s not hard. Some people are chatty, some are not. All you have to do is make your boundaries known, and the best way to do that is WITH YOUR WORDS.

I personally know someone who was almost chocked to death by her driver because she was gay and he didn\u2019t like that.", "The only thing she did wrong was not explicitly saying \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk\u201d. However, when this guy decided to lock the doors on her to berate her he becomes an asshole at absolute minimum. Fuck his hurt feelings at that point.

Take a bus if you don\u2019t want to talk to anyone. That Uber driver could\u2019ve easily been given 2 stars by some other person by coming off rude by not engaging in small talk. Everyone is different, that is why you use your words to express your personal boundaries. Someone who complains \u201cugh he tried to talk to me\u201d and another might say \u201cugh he was silent and weird\u201d if he changes the approach with the next person. I am a woman, I\u2019ve been sexually harassed and raped. For that reason, I won\u2019t use an Uber alone or go to a bar alone. But those weren\u2019t OP\u2019s concerns. OP was sleepy and thought the old guy asking her what she was studying was annoying. That\u2019s it.

No that\u2019s being an AH, yes your paying for a service and yes you are entitled to not have a conversation with that person but as a decent human being you acknowledge that they spoke to you and respectfully decline a conversation."]}
