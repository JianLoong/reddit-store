Then by some crazy fate she  ended up in your in-law family. When she first met instead of telling everybody your sisters, she followed your lead and said you were \"friends\" instead of family because I assume they knew nothing about her.. But as far as I can tell she didn't really push a relationship then either. Then she was gracious enough not to show up at the party. You could have done the polite thing and accepted the gift. \n\nSo when are you coming clean to all the in laws?

At no point did you say she was mean to you or your brother, just that she didn\u2019t understand why you didn\u2019t want to be friends with her. \nFrom where I\u2019m sitting, I don\u2019t imagine her childhood was all that happy either, as having two half siblings that make it clear they hate you isn\u2019t even remotely fixed by a father that dotes on you. Kids aren\u2019t blind, and I\u2019m sure she saw the constant yelling. \nShe was likely so happy to meet you again as an adult, hoping that you\u2019d let go of grudges and resentments. \nThe only person your anger hurts is you, and it\u2019ll cost you in the long run in your relationship with your husband\u2019s family.", "It sounds like all she ever wanted was to get to know you, but she was a physical reminder of how and why your parents marriage broke up.  \n\nHonestly, you\u2019re channeling all of the rage and frustration that you have on her, rather than your dad.

From what you\u2019ve said, she has never done anything to you for you to cut her off like this. While I understand the favoritism played had a massive impact, this was out of her control. Try to put yourself in her shoes as a child and wonder how it would feel if your sister and brother wanted nothing to do with you and not knowing why. I imagine she was hurting like you but in other ways.", "I totally understand these feelings. My older sister, younger brother, and I had a similar experience. After our parents split, he got with another woman. They then proceeded to have 3 boys back to back. Tbh though, our dad really ignored the whole lot of us for the most part. I can remember being 4 years old and hugging my dad. He didn't look at me, acknowledge me, or embrace me back. My grandfather (who was really my dad) lost his shit on my dad at the time but he still just walked out the door not giving a shit. Many instances of that throughout our child hood. With our brothers, however, he would hold them, smile at them, and act proud to be holding onto them. It was hard for us because we never got that. But we loved our brothers more than anything and we could never take that out on them. My dad's mom and his sister took it out on the kids and would have nothing to do with them. They always said he should have taken care of his first family before having another. But the kids didn't choose it and they couldn't help it. I always hated that for them because those were 2 of the most important people in my life. Still to this day I love those boys more than anything. They're all happy and have stable jobs and families. My oldest sister has done pretty well but myself and my younger brother have truly struggled. My younger brother especially. I think he missed having a caring dad more than any of us and I can understand why. As for me, I'm just a lot more on the empathetic side than any of my siblings. I feel a lot more. I think that's why my mom coddles my brother more than helping him in life. Which I do have to say that our brothers weren't attempting to whine and cry to get us in trouble for things. Of course they were more than 10 years younger than we older 3 so mostly we had more of another caretaker figure in their eyes. You're closer in age with your sister so I can see how that would be different. However, try to think of the person she is now. Try to give her the opportunity to show you who she is instead of just assuming she's still the same snot nosed brat. You may be surprised and you may end up with a very meaningful relationship. Your issues here are mostly with your dad and not her. I mean honestly, what more would you expect from a kid? Especially when the parent allows it.", "YTA, give me a break. She gave the gift to your son. Did you ever think your father treated her \"with preference\" to balance out the animosity you & your brother poured on? Grow up.", "YTA. Doesn't sound like she has done anything to you. Be pissed at your dad, not her. Not her fault she was favored or conceived.", "YTA OP she was just a child who yourself said didn't even understand why you didn't want nothing with her, she was the kid and it was your dad who did the bad things and you and your brother decided to hate her for the adults mistakes", "NAH- except your Dad. This is an incredibly difficult situation for both of you. Ideally one of you would have reached out and asked to have a sit down to discuss how to best move forward given the current circumstances) and that should still happen) But I can only imagine how overwhelming and heartbreaking this was for you (and her too in  a different way). Both of you dealing with a tough situation handled it as best you could in the moment. But now with reflection, it\u2019s time to figure out how to deal with this situation.\n\nMy advice is for you to stress the need to go slowly and take baby steps. If you can realize that you passed on the alienation and rejection you felt from your dad to her - and she can open her heart to the pain her favoritism caused - and both can realize that your father is responsible for both of those faults - you guys have a chance", "I would call bullshit on this whole story if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that there are actually some people this vile and petty.", "YTA yea, she stayed distant and only gave a gift, didn't even reveal your relationship to the family lol.

You're dad was an huge asshole too for cheating and treating 1 child differently to the others, but that isn't your half sisters fault.\n\nYou're mad at your half sister for the actions of your dad. Be mad at your dad, but it's unfair to be mad at your half sister simply because she was the product of your dads infidelity and he treated her better.\n\nYou hated a 3 year old for something she had no control over and still hold it against her now that you're both in your 20s.", "YTA. \n\nShe's going to be in his life, like it or not, because of her relationship with your BIL.

You taking it out on her makes you petty and vindictive in the eyes of the extended family, your husband, and, eventually, your son. \n\nYou don't have to be best friends, but you do have to learn to live with the situation. It would be best for everyone if you'd grow past this, and at least treat her with respect and a modicum of kindness.", "YTA.

Your parents are to blame. You chose to treat her like shit for no reason. The fact that you are now grown and still don\u2019t see anything wrong with your behavior is telling.

(I.e from Aunt&Uncle, or BIL and SIL) It's common for couples to give gifts as joint to family bc It's less expensive.\n\n\nYou need to have a talk with your husband and see how he feels about his relationship with his brother, because based on what you present here (aside from the fact that yes she probably realized she was the Golden Child at one point and utilized it and that's shitty) she really hasn't done anything wrong besides you disliking her, so I wouldn't blame her hubs / your BIL to not stand for petty disrespect.

WTF else did you expect a literal CHILD to do?! Ya\u2019ll were making a little girls life hell!

The sister and BIL aren't married yet, so no need for that unless she wants a reaction. I will say that you all need to come clean to your in-laws, friends, etc. Not being forthcoming on an issue and family relation like this can come back to bite you in the behind. You will run into your old family and you don't want them to spew a false narrative.

I wouldn\u2019t count on any of these options. Get therapy.", "NAH. You need to either accept her as a family member or cut her and by extension the brother out of your lives like a cancer tho.\n\nYou can't have it both ways. Someone has to sacrifice something and are you really okay with asking your husband to keep his brother away?", "NTA\n\nShe was an innocent child that was brought into this situation, but so were you.  The key difference is you were not provided with the same childhood, despite being raised in the same home with the same dad.  So, yeah, there is legitimate reasons why you would be uncomfortable with her presence in your adult life.\n\nYou probably should share your history with the extended family, so they have a better understanding of the relationship (or lack of) between you and your half-sister.  So that clear boundaries can be put into place for everyone's comfort.\n\nWith that said, it was a nice gesture by your half-sister to send a gift.

YTA. This poor girl had nothing to do with your dad cheating and it was cruel of you and your brother to treat her that way. I\u2019m sure your dad probably tried to compensate for how you guys isolated her by being overly nice and you SHOULD be punished for treating her with anything other than kindness. She didn\u2019t make your dad cheat, your anger should be directed towards him not her. \nIt sounds to me like she really just wants a relationship with her siblings she grew up with and was trying to be a good aunt.

As a kid, your half sister had no control over your dad\u2019s behaviour. What you did, and how you seem to have acted over the years, seems pretty petty to me.

Like how do you imagine family gatherings to go?\n\nOr how your husband's family is going to deal with this moving forward? I know who i'd invite and who i would ask my son to keep away.", "YTA. Get help. Seriously. You need to get therapy. Your anger is misplaced and you are self-sabotaging.", "I don't think it's a coincidence she dated your husband's brother.

I get why people are saying yta for taking it on her half sister but she\u2019s not taking it out. Op wants nothing to do with her sister or want her around cause she the last reminder of her shitty father.", "You really expect us to believe that in all this time the half-sister wouldn't tell her *fiance* that you and she are related? Come on...", "YTA and you\u2019re punishing her for simply existing. You\u2019ve allowed childish jealously and petty grudges to ruin your life. Have a conversation with her, grow up and move on. Your kid is lucky to have so many people who want to celebrate them.", "Sorry in this situation YTA. Growing up it was your father that was clearly the AH. He treated you like crap so in turn you and your brother got frustrated at half sister and it sounds like not alway be super nice which is normal for kids. In turn she complained to Dad which is also normal kid behavior. Instead of fixing the situation he perpetuated the problem. \n\nIt sounds like she\u2019s been pretty respectful since coming back into your life and letting you choose what you want shared about your true relationship. She didn\u2019t force herself on you even in a party that really as future sil she should\u2019ve been included in. I get that she surrounds a lot of your childhood trauma but she wasn\u2019t the cause and she\u2019s about to be family on your husband\u2019s side.

Whatever boundaries you have, whatever rules you want her to follow. She was born into a shit situation, isn't responsible for your father's terrible parenting, and seems to be *trying* to respect your desire to not be considered sisters.", "Um even if you want to ignore the aunt connection from your aunt-she\u2019s still your sons aunt as his dad\u2019s brothers wife. YTA bc as shitty as your dad is it doesn\u2019t sound like she was old enough to understand why you hated her , and as an adult has respected your wishes to stay away. You\u2019re missing a great opportunity for the kids at least to have some sort of relationship and will eventually add strain to your husband and bill relationship.", "Yes YTA. She will technically be your child\u2019s aunt twice over once married lol. You need to work on this in therapy because what happens if they decide to have kids? What are you going to do for family events? You gonna tell your child to actively avoid them? Your being incredibly unfair and childish. I\u2019d expect them from a teenager not an adult with a child. Also, let your in-laws in and take full blame for it people don\u2019t like to feel like they been played as a fool.", "Be polite but with strong boundaries.

If she had actually respected your wishes then the gift would never have been sent.", "YTA and it seems you\u2019ve been one to your sister since you were kids.  Your dad has probably been an ah too, but it\u2019s no excuse for the horrible way you have treated your sister.  Counseling and Therapy might help you deal with all this misplaced hostility and immaturity that\u2019s causing so much stress for you and your family.", "Yta. The anger and hatred you have for her is unwarranted. The blame should be put on your father alone. That\u2019s literally the person who did you and your brother wrong. As a child ofc she is going to complain to her parents when her siblings don\u2019t want to hang out with her like any child would. I think you should het therapy and then have an actually conversation with her.", "YTA - what did she ever do but be born?

It was always your dad, so I don't get why you are punishing her. Maybe she told your dad that you were nasty to her, but you were. .. did you tried to ignore her?", "Gentle YTA. You don't have to accept her gift, but your anger seems to be misplaced.  It is not her fault her parents fucked up your life. The present probably would've been better accompanied by a reconcilatory note acknowledging how spoiled she was compared to you as kids, but often children don't recognize those things...and even if she knew what was happening, she likely did not have any power to force you father to treat you right.", "NAH. You ladies need to speak. She will always be a part of your family. Maybe speaking to each and hashing it out will open a form of relationship. From what you\u2019ve said, she didn\u2019t do anything to you growing up except be present. Sounds like you should be more upset with your Dad for how differently he treated all of you growing up. Maybe, just maybe as adults, you 2 can find a common ground and even start to build a relationship.", "How does no one else in your husband\u2019s family not know that she and you are sisters?! Why wouldn\u2019t you say anything? This is incredibly strange.", "You know, you could have just thrown out the gift or donated it.  What makes you t ass is that you sent it back to her. Your half sister is an ass for referring to you as a friend. Frankly, your in laws should know about all this so when this gets stickier, and it will, they understand why.  \nIt\u2019s time to grow up, get some therapy and find joy in your life knowing that for as long as either of you are in this family you can not avoid the issues.", "You have wasted a lot of energy directed toward the wrong person. Now, perhaps your sister is a truly vile human being and came out of the womb this way. Or, perhaps, she was simply a child (like your child) who had nothing to do with her parent's behavior and wanted her sister to love her. As an adult, the story you tell seems to indicate she is thoughtful person and has been respectful of your desires. Shame to lose someone like that in your life and the life of your child just because you are bitter and hurt by your father. You are not an AH, but it is questionable whether you are not the better person. Your child deserves a mom who can understand and cope with her pain.

Well except you, if you keep this ridiculous behaviour going, now that you are a grown a** woman with a kid of her own.", "YTA. It seems you have some misplace anger. Your DAD did this to you and your family. Your half sister has nothing to do with the divorce. You have both grown and changed so much since you knew her before.

In worst case with his whole family? \n\nBecause that's where you are headed.\n\nAnd is that really nessesary?

This isn\u2019t her fault either.", "My brother was my mom\u2019s golden child and I was my father\u2019s golden child. Our family dynamics hurt both of us in different ways and I was years into adulthood and after my brother\u2019s death before I could clearly see how I was so favored by my father and he by my mother and how much it hurt our relationship. I\u2019m 50 and I\u2019m still coming to terms with it. You can\u2019t blame the favored child at all. She was just as hurt by the father\u2019s behavior as OP was. She was robbed of what could have been a healthy relationship with her siblings and was instead raised in a household where she was considered \u201cother\u201d by those that should have been her closest confidants. This is no one\u2019s fault other than the parents\u2014and if OP cannot see this, she has unresolved trauma from her childhood that she should work out\u2026instead of blaming her equally traumatized half sister.", "I\u2019m trying to figure out how the cheater dad got full custody.", "I mean... it wasn't her fault that your parents divorced. she's your sister and she's trying to buid a bridge but you are too bitter by your childhood memories that you just choose to blame her. Go to therapy. YTA.", "Really sounds like your problem is with your dad. You seem to be blaming your half sister for things she never asked for or fully understood. So yeah, you are the asshole. If you want to be mature and actually move on with life, you should probably give her a chance. You might find out that she's a great person and a valuable friend. Continuing to blame her for your dad's behaviour is just childish and petty. If I were your husband I would have told you as much as soon as I learned the truth.", "NTA. And if this is the way you want to go forward then you need to tell your in-laws the whole story so everyone understands where you stand and will hopefully respect your wishes.", "I'm gonna say NTA. The only AH I see here is your dad, for treating your half-sister like the golden child your whole lives. I fully understand the resentment you feel towards her, but this is not her fault. She was a child - she had no say in how she was treated. Now she's an adult, and she's been as respectful of your boundaries as possible given the circumstances. The fact that most of your family don't know about your relationship just gives you both an extra set of hoops to jump through, and is only going to lead to more awkwardness for you both when people start noticing the coldness between you. \n\nHonestly, I think it's time to give her a chance. Sit down with her as adults and have a proper conversation about your feelings, and how you can navigate things going forward. You don't have to become the closest of friends, but you are both part of the same family now, whether you like it or not. Be clear with her that you're NC with your father and that you don't wish to hear about him, or for him to hear about you, and give her a chance to be in your life and respect that boundary. If she doesn't, then at least you'll know for sure where you stand.", "You know that you\u2019re TA when even the AITA sub is taking the golden child\u2019s side, lol. YTA, OP. As everyone else is saying: grow the fuck up.", "YTA. There's bound to be issues with blended families, but you were children! You projected your hatred of the situation onto a child and are continuing to do so as an adult. Grow up.", "You were understandably bitter and jealous and your child brain interpreted everything from that point of view. Your father most likely handled the situation poorly, not least because he felt guilty, but it doesn't sound as if anything was your half sister's fault.\n\nNow, you just can't give it up, even as an adult, when she's trying to give you an olive branch, and it would very much benefit everyone if you did: you, your half-sister, your brother and your husband and children. Give it up, get over it or you really are the asshole.\n\nEdit: I have an absent dad and two half sisters. My father never gave two shits about me but that's not the fault of my half sisters. I don't have a close relationship with any of them, but I meet them on occasion when we're in the same town to catch up and we send Christmas presents to each other's children.", "This is a tough one\n\n- firstly based off the math, she'd have been 4ish when she came to live with you. Is it reasonable or logical to think that a 4 year old, who never really knew you guys existed (even if she did) could interpret that she's a mistress baby? \n- secondly, children are born without sin, why should this child be the target of your hatred? If anything you were the illogical ones, but you were also children so can you expect anymore? As a child it's understandable you felt that way, as an adult it's very immature to not reevaluate that possibly the dynamics in the home were unfair to ALL of you, obviously more so to you both but at the end of the day she was on the receiving end of hate for no real reason\n-thirdly, had you and your sibling not treated her hatefully in the beginning, maybe your father may not have given her favouritism. He sees that he has 3 children and the youngest is receiving unwarranted hatred, it's not her fault and possibly feels guilty so he plays favourites with the child who's being treated poorly and is also the child that probably likes him the most at that time. Is that objectively fair to you two? No it isn't but neither was your treatment towards her.\n\nNow you're both adults, you clearly don't want anyone to know your half siblings yet decide to let your past baggage with her affect your decisions while trying to keep this secret? It won't stay behind closed doors forever and I think you have not handled any situations here well from child to adult. I don't blame child you for your actions fully, but you're not 21, your 27, deal with it like an adult and find a way to coexist because what your dad did was traumatic to you and you need to heal from it.\n\nSomeone else mentioned the mistress child likely knew she was being favourited, I don't believe as a child no, but as she got older sure I can see it being very plausible. Do you rationally think, if she was 13 and abdicated her favouritism that you'd like her more? Shes being cordial and kind with you now and you hate her. She came in your life a blank slate and you hated her. I don't think there'd be anything she could do to make you like her bc she exists as a physical reminder of what *your dad did* and I don't blame her for soaking it up. I wouldn't want to be miserable with my siblings hating me for something I didn't do while trying to convince them to like me, only for that not to work.", "YTA.\n\nGrow tf up and get some therapy. The way you blame and hate her is pathetic. You should be mad at your dad not her. This behaviour is ridiculous at the age of 27. \n\nI honestly feel sorry for your half sister for having a future ahead where she will be constantly dealing with you and your bs.", "So she actually respected your boundaries and you still send the gift back. Your BIL is correct, that is an AH move. \n\nYTA.", "yta. she\u2019s part of your family whether you like it or not, which means accepting gifts from her. the gift she gave wasn\u2019t meant for you and wasn\u2019t your place to return it. i suggest therapy for you.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re TA. People can say you should be the bigger person or it wasn\u2019t her fault but she\u2019s an adult now. She\u2019s more than capable of understanding that sometimes you don\u2019t get what you want, and I do respect that she has kept a distance, but the present to your son was unnecessary especially coming from her. \n\nIf she really wanted him to have it she could\u2019ve just said it was from her fianc\u00e9. I don\u2019t understand what she was trying to do there, especially putting \u201caunt\u201d on there (though she technically is/will be). But if she was trying to keep a respectful distance this action by her was counterintuitive. Maybe she was testing waters, otherwise not sure what she expected. \n\nI think you definitely should try to minimize any friction going forward as much as you can. Indifference is your best weapon, if you truly have no desire to have a relationship with her remain cordial and don\u2019t give your in laws a handle in case they find out in the future and anyone tries to make you the bad guy. You drew a line with this so hopefully she gets the message and backs off.", "> She said that I was being immature by denying a gift meant for someone else.\n\nShe\u2019s right. YTA. Don\u2019t ruin your kid\u2019s chance to have a relationship with his aunt. \n\nAnd your ~~half-~~ sister did nothing to deserve shitty treatment from you except having that *absolute gall* to be born. The horror!\n\nAre you going to explain to your kid why he didn\u2019t get a gift from Auntie Namehere?", "I go with YTA. You don't sound mature enough. By now you should understand that it's not your sisters fault your father cheated. And it's not her fault he spoiled her to make up for the fake her siblings denied her.\n\nHow about you get to know the person she is now?\n\nShe will be your Kids aunt by marriage and the day will come wer your child will ask what's the problem.", "It's pretty simple she knows op doesn't like her, so stay away from ops kid. It doesn't matter if that's the uncles finance. The uncle is the child's family, not the uncles wife. Plenty if kids barely interact with their uncle and aunts significat others, she should have known not to send a present if you don't want any contact.", "I\u2019m not going to say whether you\u2019re an asshole or not. Only that you don\u2019t need to maintain anything but a cordial relationship. Maybe a meal is needed to outline exactly that: that she will not be playing the \u201caunt\u201d role. It will be hard but it\u2019s necessary to outline what the expectations are. She should be treated cordially and respectfully. However, things will probably change once they marry (uncle is an uncle, and he should be invited to play that fun role!) However, if you treat her with an antagonistic attitude, what partner will come over to where their spouse is treated poorly? You don\u2019t want to separate your child from their uncle. There are plenty of marriages and families that keep the in laws within arms length, and it doesn\u2019t need to be full of conflict and tension.", "YTA Why haven\u2019t the rest of the family know she is your half of sister?

You hold her accountable for your father\u2019s actions. She didn\u2019t ask to be born from an affair and she had nothing to do with it. You hated her for having the audacity to exist. And as an adult you still do. Which is ridiculous. Look at your son. Now imagine he has half sibling that treat him like dirt for the simple crime of being born. Does that hurt? Yeah\u2026. It does doesn\u2019t it. And as far as your father favoring her, well\u2026. That\u2019s his fault. She wasn\u2019t doing anything mean and even stayed away from the party.

Even the \u201cGolden Child\u201d of a parent often has their own issues and problems that result from that treatment.

By treating her entirely as an extension of how your dad raised her, you\u2019re acting as if she isn\u2019t her own person, even now, after 20 years. \n\nYou may find if you sit down with her and talk with empathy about your childhoods, that the real problematic behavior came from your dad and the way he pitted the two of you against each other. You may find you don\u2019t like her; and that\u2019s fine \u2014 but you should not like \u2014*her*, rather than the way your dad treated her when she was 5. \n\nYou also, to be clear, have every right to ignore people who cause you pain and frustration, but she is part of your family in two ways now and it seems like avoiding her will only alienate you from your new family (playing out a familiar dynamic).

That \"good\" kids just get certain benefits that \"problem\" kids would also get if only they learned to behave. It's not difficult to frame another child as a problem if every mistake they make is attributed to malice, and is probably even easier if the golden child feels like the scapegoat is unkind to them, seemingly out of nowhere. \n\nThe golden child, on the other hand, is often rewarded with a gilded cage. They get as much attention and adoration as they know what to do with, but often at high cost. They might be overly protected, or have all of their parents expectations thrust on to them. Their parents may rely on them to an unreasonable extent, to the point that even sympathizing with the scapegoat is framed as a betrayal to the parents who need them and love them. Meanwhile, there may be a perception that if they fuck up or lose favor, they'll become completely undeserving of any kind love or attention because again, they've been convinced that that's normal. \n\nWe don't know the sisters side of the story, or if this is the dynamic at hand,  but the point is that parents (or abusers) really warp a kid's perception, *especially* if the other party isn't challenging that perception (which OP probably wasn't, as she mentioned not wanting to be around her sister).

Your anger is misdirected. Go back and read what you wrote. The worst you could say about her was that as a child, she told on the two of you for treating her badly. In that same line, you say that she didn't even know anything that had happened. You can't blame her for the actions of your father. She was just the byproduct. You and your brother were victims of your father. That was him doing all of it. Choices he made. She's innocent of it. If you want to dwell in the past and continue living with that anger towards your father, then by all means. If you want to confront someone, then go talk to him. You're an adult. But you can't use what he did to you to justify and excuse how you treat her. You're treating her the same way that you say your father treated you. Think about this. Would you want your sister acting toward your son the way you do toward her? You should be saying no to that question. But by your logic, she's justified in doing so. She's marrying into the same family you have.

She talked to her parents about how hurt and sad this made her, and then you just hated her more.\n\nIf anything, you and your brother are the ones who were unkind and unfair to her as children. Maybe even bullied her? I understand why. You were struggling kids, and I don't expect struggling kids to be fair and rational. However, you hated her, excluded her, and it sounds like were unkind to her as children when she did literally nothing wrong. Being born is not her fault. Also, being sad you weren't nice to her also isn't something bad she did. Being favored by your dad, is also not something she choose or did to you. \n\nThe only thing it sounds like you could possibly argue she did \"wrong\" was not stand up for you and your brother to your dad when he was berating you. But, remember you are the older kids who hated her for no reason and were never nice to you. Even if you had treated her kindly it would be unfair to expect the younger child to stand up to an adult for you.

Obviously, your father is a bigger asshole. I get that. But in the story of your brother's family, YTA.
