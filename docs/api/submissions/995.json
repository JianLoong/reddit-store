Warning for the flavour is really the only thing that could have helped more.\n\nShe flipped out a little, firstly from alarm that she may have been served alcohol (regardless of the reason she does not want to consume) when she requested otherwise, and then likely from embarrassment at making an unnecessary scene. Probably didn't need to call you an asshole but if that's all it was then I'm sure you've had worse interactions.\n\nIt could be an ESH, but honestly it the grand scheme of things it's confusion over a drink order and I can't bring myself to judge harshly in this situation.", "Soft ESH. I also bartend and use the alcohol free/removed stuff. But you have to read the labels, a lot of the time do have a percentage, even if it's very small.  So I always ask if .05% ( or whatever the percentage) is okay.  \n\nMy boss's girlfriend has been 100% alcohol free and won't drink anything that isn't 0.0% because it's that worrisome to her to relapse and after her freak out (similar to this) I started to treat it like an allergy, mainly to avoid situations like this. The more you inform your patrons and ask questions the less it comes back to bite you, but I also over communicate.\n\nAt the same time here behavior is uncalled for and if she was that worried she should have communicated better.  I'd be sour over her too.", "Im going with soft YTA. What if that person was a recovering alcoholic and the taste alone sets them off. I know it wasn't the case in this situation but you never know. When someone asks for a virgin drink if ita going to taste like there is alchohol in there its best that you warn them.", "I don\u2019t drink and I would hate this. If someone made my drink taste like alcohol I would be annoyed. Some people don\u2019t want the taste of alcohol. And this might be trigging for recovering addicts. Just make the drink virgin and offer to add if they want. But I wouldn\u2019t put it in there without them knowing. YTA", "I think you both could have handled the situation better. If someone orders a virgin cocktail, they specifically do not want alcohol. So giving them something that tastes like alcohol without warning, especially if the substitute you use is very uncommon, is not a good idea. You caused this girl a bit of panic because she couldn't have alcohol and thought that you had served it to her after she specifically asked you not to. \n\nPersonally, I dislike the taste and smell of alcohol, so avoiding that is the whole point of ordering a virgin drink for me. If I were given a drink that smelled and tasted like the \"real thing,\" I'd ask for it to be re-made without the added ingredient.  \n\nHowever, I wouldn't be rude about it. Accidents happen, orders get switched by mistake. She could have questioned whether you had accidentally given her a drink tasting like alcohol, and explaining that she couldn't drink it if you did, without being rude and pitching a fit about it.", "So I don\u2019t think you\u2019re necessarily TA but I do think this was really dumb to not warn customers about the fake alcohol. You have no idea why she wanted a virgin drink. I think just letting customers know \u201cI have an alcohol substitute that I can add to virgin drinks to give it the alcohol flavor, would you like that or would you like it without?\u201d Would be a much better way to go about this substitute in the future as there are likely a large number of people who would also have a strong reaction/prefer a drink without the alcohol taste.", "YTA - if it tastes that close to the real thing, a simple warning about the flavor could have made this whole thing go away. I've never heard of this de-alcoholized booze before and I'm sure I'm not in the minority of humans in that boat... and if you're taking a med that interacts with booze, I'm sure the feeling of panic was strong for her. \nJust take it as a learning experience, OP, and do better in the future.", "YTA - as someone who also doesn't/can't drink, my first assumption if i was given a drink that tasted like alcohol would be that it had alcohol in it? i've accidentally been given drinks in the past that had alcohol in them and i've never had a non-alcoholic drink that was supposed to mimic the taste of the real thing (i prefer when they don't personally), it seems completely reasonable to assume that that is why it tastes like alcohol. if the person had never been there and there's nothing to indicate that the virgin drinks might taste like alcohol, i think it's totally fine to be annoyed or frustrated especially if it's for medical reason.", "NTA.\n\nShe was just embarrassed that she was wrong.\n\nHowever, I have never tasted non alcoholic spirit before and I am sure I would be confused as hell if I tried it.

They are rarely listed on the menu, so I almost always leave it up to the bartender\u2019s discretion based on what they can make non-alcoholic given their ingredients on hand. it\u2019s not just ordering a classic cocktail and telling them to drop the booze, which is often equivalent to just ordering juice or soda and isn\u2019t a mocktail at all. I have had some amazing complex mocktails by ordering this way.

If you\u2019re able to make a non alcoholic drink taste real then you did your job better than anticipated and deserve all the kudos. Didn\u2019t she watch you make the drink? Isn\u2019t that one of the reasons to go to the bartender? For the showmanship? I don\u2019t understand her problem. She got better than what she asked for. To prevent embarrassment she should have politely asked what mix you used because it tasted so real.", "NTA.  You sound amazing.  I'm sorry that she treated you that way.", "NTA - wish places here did that. We get stryup and lemonade for mock tails \u2026", "NTA\n\nWow.  What a rude customer.  I can understand the initial shock--that's enough reason to be sus--but after being showed the stuff and a demonstration of it being made, which would be interesting, humility would be key.  That is to say, an apology and a thanks.", "NTA. You made the best drink, and when she found out she was wrong about there being alcohol in it,  she just doubled down out of embarrassment. You did nothing wrong, she just can't admit fault.", "NTA but I've also never heard of virgin meaning that you'll add NA to give the alcohol flavor. Some people order virgin because they don't like the alcohol taste, but enjoy the rest of the recipe.

Yeah omg, call the cops \ud83d\ude06", "ESH.  She sucks for not specifying while taking meds and you suck for not warning her that it would taste like alcohol.\n\nBoth of you didn't use your words or judgement, thankfully though it ended in a simple misunderstanding.", "Dont order a virgin cocktail at a bar if you dont want it to taste at all like alcohol.

Don't have the link but there was a study on artificial sweetners that showed that even sweetners with zero sugars that were a zero on the glycemic index and were supposed to have no effect on blood sugar whatsoever still caused blood sugars to rise. They thought the sweet taste caused the body to raise blood sugar in response. An non-alcoholic drink that tastes like an alcoholic drink could have a biological and psychological effect that causes the person to crave alcohol.  Even if it is just psychological that could be a real problem.", "Exactly this. I know you had good intentions, but if someone were a recovering alcoholic this would have serious consequences.", "This! I hate the taste of alcohol.

It's not the bartenders fault they didn't know what they ordered. Besides being a rational person and explaining you think there has been a mix up is the non-asshole way of acquiring information about a situation.", "I have to disagree. Certainly, OP could have told her about the de-alcoholized ingredient, and it would have removed any later confusion. HOWEVER, responding in the way this customer did is completely uncalled for (assuming OP is being honest in their telling). A quiet aside with the bartender would have been far more appropriate and respectful. Rather, she had to make a spectacle out of it and get some attention.

Even most NA beer has .05% ABV.", "But shouldn't the person go up to the bar and say \"hey I think we had a mix up, I ordered the virgin drink and this tastes like alcohol\" instead of going up there and flipping out? I think the conflict isn't the drink tasted like alcohol but the person reacting to the bartender who made a drink so good it had to have alcohol", "But they didnt ask for a NA bev that didn\u2019t taste like a cocktail.  The phrasing was \u201cwhatever the best virgin drink was\u201d.  That is what was made.  I\u2019d say NAH \u2014 OP made what was asked.   Girl was concerned it had booze.   But OP isn\u2019t an AH for doing exactly what they were asked to do.   \n\nThere is in fact a wave of cocktail mimicking NA bevs.  A lot of people appreciate them and want them.  Assuming someone wants a juice cocktail because they\u2019re in recovery or on medication is also a problem.   People shouldn\u2019t be treated like children for wanting to consume a beverage without booze.", "Why would she specify that she was taking medication when ordering a virgin drink? \n\nIf a bartender is going to use a really niche non alcoholic spirit that in his own words tastes just like alcohol he should be making it clear to customers or he's going to get this issue.", "my point was that i thought op was invalidating where the customer was coming from. if you think you've accidentally ingested something that you can't (especially for medical reasons), i can understand being upset. i try not to be rude personally but it can be frustrating and in this specific scenario, as i said, it is more reasonable to assume that your drink was made incorrectly and if it's a smaller bar or not particularly busy, i can understand how that - getting the wrong drink- would read as kind of negligent and would warrant an attitude. i laughed it off in the scenarios i referenced because i was either friends with the bartenders or was at a swamped (loud) show and i personally know that i wouldn't get sick from a single sip, but those obviously aren't going to apply. working in any kind of food service warrants caution specifically because you don't know why someone has the specifications that they do. i've never drank, like on purpose, but there is also the issue of \"mock\" alcoholic drinks, like non-alcoholic beer being triggering for alcoholics specifically for how strongly they resemble real alcohol - a lot of people i know who order virgin drinks do it for that reason, too, so this seems like a weird thing to not tell people.", "Some medications are extremely dangerous to mix with alcohol. If I ordered something non-alcoholic and it tasted like there was alcohol in it, I would be pretty freaked out. Mixing certain medications with alcohol is no joke.", "i've definitely had experiences with being infantilized for not drinking, so i get that, but i wouldn't necessarily assume that \"best\" means \"tastes the most like alcohol?\" i specifically don't want my drinks to taste like alcohol and still wouldn't be able to drink it even if it didn't have actual alcohol in it. i don't think OP meant this maliciously or to fuck with this person on purpose, just that people are largely going to assume that an alcoholic taste means an alcoholic taste and given the range of reasons why someone might want to avoid alcohol you're going to get some varied responses. if this was an option, then it would be different thing but from the provided information there was no way to opt in or out of whether or not the drink had spirits in them or knowledge that they would be in them at all. this feels like assuming a lot.", "Why would he specify what\u2019s in the drink when she said \u201cI\u2019ll drink anything thanks\u201d", "I didn't say she should specify she is taking meds, I said she should specify what she wants to drink.\n\nThat made her partially the AH in this situation.", "I can understand concern if you can't have something and you think you ingested it, however I don't think coming in hot with attitude from the jump is ever warranted. That's a human person she was speaking to. If you go to a high end bar that serves mocktails and you don't inquire as to a drink list, then tell the bartender to make you the best virgin cocktail, then don't inquire as to what you purchased, then come back to the bar to have attitude with the bartender, then not believe them telling and showing you the faux spirits, then get attitude again after they make you another of the same drink I assume for free... You're definitely the asshole", "Right, I would also be concerned but what I wouldn't do is go off the handle on the bartender who made an excellent drink for a patron who didn't specify anything nor ask for a drink menu. I'm sure the bar in question is quite proud of their stocking of faux spirits. I'm willing to bet their drink menu has their addition included in all the descriptions.

My friends (2/3) ordered alcoholic beverages, the server had only asked for one ID, and I explicitly asked for a *VIRGIN* pi\u00f1a collada (bc I was underaged and absolutely looked it, super baby face, would never try to sneak it bc I am afraid of confrontation lol.) We all get our drinks. I slam mine bc it was so good, I loved it. Within 10 mins, I felt dizzy, my stomach hurt, I felt nauseous, I just didn't feel right. My friend called the server over to get the bill because they were gonna take me to urgent care. The server asks if everything is okay. My friend spits out the gist of my issues, when the server remarks, \"aww, I'm sorry. Sometimes the liquor hits me a little hard and fast too. I hope you feel better! I'm so sorry.\" We all stopped and looked at each other. I asked her what she served me. She said a pi\u00f1a collada. I repeated \"a *virgin* pi\u00f1a collada?\" She stared at me for a second and said \"no, regular, why?\" We were all shook. We didn't say much afterwards, got the bill, tipped her a little, and went to the mall. It was wild. I definitely looked young and all the girls commented on how I *absolutely most definitely asked for a VIRGIN drink* so I know I wasn't crazy. I wanted to complain to the manager but I never ended up calling.\n\nI got served alcohol *without my consent or knowledge in a well established restaurant chain.* I am terrified of this happening again so I try to avoid bar restaurants entirely.

I am by far not the only person it's happened to.\n\nEdit: IDK where you are from exactly, where I am from, if you order a virgin drink, it tastes virgin. You have to ask for spirits. Usually they serve some fruity sh*t if you ask for \"anything virgin.\" My FIL has been a bartender at a local bar for over 20 years.

Migraine is a complicated disease and it presents differently in everyone. But many of the people who have to avoid a trigger (like alcohol) have to avoid the taste or smell...not just ingestion. And some people with migraines can have serious and scary side effects. I order mocktails to avoid this, and a drink like you're describing could easily trigger a migraine. Unfortunately, my migraines generally look and function like strokes...so I wouldn't even be able to tell you what's wrong...I could literally take a sip or two and then suddenly collapse and be unable to speak. I could also begin vomiting uncontrollably, lose my eyesight, and develop a dozen less predictable symptoms...but stroke-like weakness and aphasia are virtual guarantees.\n\nJust asking the clarifying question could prevent many miscommunications and some dangerous situations...maybe even an ER visit.

Of coarse the first few years into recovery she wouldn\u2019t, but absolutely alcoholics can be in bars and spaces of the like like anyone else.", "nice try. your example is off, it's more like telling someone with a deadly allergy/deadly phobia of cats that maybe they shouldnt go to a cat cafe\n\nthis isnt to say that every alcoholic/every person taking medication is like this. just the ones that are so afraid of ingesting alcohol that they shout at their bartender for giving them something with an alcoholic taste. in fact, if your go-to response is to shout at ANYONE in customer service for ANY reason, then theres no phobia or allergy that makes that an excuse. you're just an AH.", "He literally did not say anything about not being able to have grapefruit until he started freaking out. And, again, this was after he had already read the ingredients out loud and had no problem with any of them.", "Yeah, the thing is... it's not actually non-alcoholic. It can't be, because that wouldn't have the taste, which comes from the alcohol molecules. Legally, they are allowed to call it non-alcoholic if it's below 0.05% alcohol, and sure for the intent of getting drunk, it might as well be - but if you have an allergy/intolerance or a medication interaction, then it may still be enough to get you ill.", "This entire thread with people claiming they\u2019ve never heard of non alcohol drinks is wild to me. Where does everyone live? I\u2019m in London & non alcoholic beer & Seedlip in particular are on every menu"]}
