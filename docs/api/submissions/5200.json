Nurturing your partner when they're at their low points, and when they're telling you they need your affection, that's what a loving partner would do. It honestly sounds like you don't really love him. You just love having a strong firefighter husband and don't like it when he can't be that.", "YTA do u have no empathy or care for your own husband? I once had a really bad mental breakdown and panic attacks that followed were violent. I couldn't go to office and I wanted to ask my husband to stay home too but was not able to say anything due to anxiety. You know what he did, he called in from work already, made a care package and cuddled with me all day because I was sick. And he had some important meetings that day. So if my husband can cancel out his important meeting without me asking, can't u stay home and not go shopping one day when your husband asked you and he has been unwell.", "I'm going to give you a very soft YTA for two reasons.

Your husband felt like crap and you decided shopping was more important the boosting his morale.", "Girl you\u2019re TA in this scenario.

Your husband is still going through an illness, regardless if it\u2019s really bad or he\u2019s fully recovered, he asked you to stick by his side just for a while before you went out.

Being by someone\u2019s side while they aren\u2019t feeling better and even going so far as to aid them in recovering isn\u2019t babying.

You seem to be TA in this situation to me. Your partner is sick and the way you described it seems like you don't care that much. I can't imagine saying those things and muting my partner if they were sick. I get that you had to do something important but you sound tired of your partner honestly. For me personally those aren't things you do to someone you love and care about especially if they're sick.\n\nTo be fair your husband does sound whiny and a little dramatic but I think a lot of people would be too if they got really sick, especially with their partners. Plus who doesn't want cuddles?\n\n\nUpdate:\n\nApparently OP has been out since Day 1 (today being Day 3) of their husband getting sick. I previously considered that they probably got burnt out doing everything at home and was panicking about Christmas.\n\nOP, your husband clearly needs to be comforted because you've barely been around the whole time they've been sick. That's very reasonable and not clingy at all! The guy has been constantly throwing up and defecating for the past 2 days while you're not around and you think them asking you to comfort them for a few extra minutes is \"babying\" them? \n\nYour partner is a person too and they deserve to receive comfort from the person who they love most when they're unwell. That's not clinginess especially because you've been out all this time. Also how can you even stand being out this whole time unless you're working/doing something really important? If I had been out for the past two days I would spend this day staying home making sure my partner is doing okay instead of shopping of all things (which I'm assuming what you meant by \"picking up clothes\").\n\nGentle YTA to YTA.", "YTA - You're husband was right that clothes shopping can wait.

If he doesn\u2019t suffer well in general and you\u2019ve grown irritated by that, you should\u2019ve addressed it.

Your husband is a grown man. 3 days of food poisoning (you don't say what his symptoms are or how much you've been taking care of him, but I've had it, and it was exhausting and painful and gross) can be brutal, & I'm assuming he's feeling pretty weak.

Not at all! It is used to describe the traits and actions that are considered 'masculine' that are damaging to others and the man himself. For example, protectiveness to the point of being controlling is a toxic masculine trait.", "I already clarified this in my previous comment if you read it:\n\n\"Although what they did (\"picking up some clothes\") might not be that urgent but I'm not really sure because of the way they phrased it.\"", "Sorry, I find it hard to turn it off like a switch.

She could be a working woman and she would still be TA. You are focusing on the wrong thing here (I feel like I've just been mansplained to, ironically enough) and it's stuff like this that makes people like OP get worse. Because now she could jump on this and say \"Yeah! I have the right to spend my husband's money!\" since you've just given her a free pass since she MIGHT be a housewife (we should note, we also don't know if she is a housewife, so your whole comment might not even be valid). I'm a woman who was raised by a SAHM, I'm fully AWARE a housewife does her own share of work. But she went out for a personal reason WHILE HER HUSBAND WAS SICK, and then to add insult to injury, she used her husband's money to do it. Let's be real, if we flip it, that's like if the husband came home, saw her sick and she asked to cuddle, and he told her \"stop being a baby. Btw, I'm still expecting dinner on the table\" and left.

Some people actually do not do well home all day. Some people do not do well being around another person constantly. OP seems to be the later category.

But not only is he still sick, he just wanted to cuddle. Is that a sin? To ask for love? This isn't transactional.

I would argue in a misandrist way.  Toxic gender roles can be enforced by men/women or non-binary individuals. \n\nMy main issue with those who call men babies when they are upset about being ill or refer to \"the man flu\" is that men often die because they don't go to the doctor to get something checked. This comes from them not wanting to be a burden, or being told to man up or accused of having the man flu when they had a more minor illness. \n\nAcross the board men need to be encouraged to speak out about their health.

Very rarely do people just write down all their thoughts with no editing or tailoring to purpose whatsoever. \n\nSo since this subreddit is specifically requesting judgments, I put on my critical thinking cap and tried to arbitrate based on the facts. Empathy is certainly important in establishing harm, but blindly empathizing with the clear asshole of the situation just muddies the discourse without adding any useful information."]}
