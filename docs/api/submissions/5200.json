But I know many couples where one of them will stay home and not do anything because the other is sick. \n\nSo my thought is, if you were sick, and you asked him to not go do something non necessarily, would he stay home?

Nurturing your partner when they're at their low points, and when they're telling you they need your affection, that's what a loving partner would do. It honestly sounds like you don't really love him. You just love having a strong firefighter husband and don't like it when he can't be that.", "YTA do u have no empathy or care for your own husband? I once had a really bad mental breakdown and panic attacks that followed were violent. I couldn't go to office and I wanted to ask my husband to stay home too but was not able to say anything due to anxiety. You know what he did, he called in from work already, made a care package and cuddled with me all day because I was sick. And he had some important meetings that day. So if my husband can cancel out his important meeting without me asking, can't u stay home and not go shopping one day when your husband asked you and he has been unwell.", "I'm going to give you a very soft YTA for two reasons.

Wanting to be comforted while sick is not Something to shame ppl for.\n\nThe way you talk about your partner sounds like you don't like them a lot.", "YTA.  Your husband felt like crap and you decided shopping was more important the boosting his morale.", "Girl you\u2019re TA in this scenario. I know from going to a few weddings that apart of the vows is to love/have and to hold through SICKNESS and in health. Your husband is still going through an illness, regardless if it\u2019s really bad or he\u2019s fully recovered, he asked you to stick by his side just for a while before you went out.

To give an example, Babying someone would be to pacify negative behaviors and label them as okay or even good because you don\u2019t want to have to comfort the issue. Being by someone\u2019s side while they aren\u2019t feeling better and even going so far as to aid them in recovering isn\u2019t babying. If a man wants to be snuggled up with his wife while he isn\u2019t feeling good, that shouldn\u2019t be considered babying.\n\nI hoped you apologized to him, and I hope he recovers successfully.", "Right, and if this was the other way around, he would be called an AH.", "YTA.. not for going shopping because I\u2019m sure he can last without you for a couple of hours but the things you said were really an asshole move. \u2018I don\u2019t care\u2019 and then muting him.. to me that\u2019s not okay :(", "Gentle YTA. You seem to be TA in this situation to me. Your partner is sick and the way you described it seems like you don't care that much. I can't imagine saying those things and muting my partner if they were sick. I get that you had to do something important but you sound tired of your partner honestly. For me personally those aren't things you do to someone you love and care about especially if they're sick.\n\nTo be fair your husband does sound whiny and a little dramatic but I think a lot of people would be too if they got really sick, especially with their partners.

If he doesn\u2019t suffer well in general and you\u2019ve grown irritated by that, you should\u2019ve addressed it.

He\u2019s sick. He\u2019s probably vomiting and pooping and feeling like garbage. You don\u2019t NEED clothes.

When I'm sick, I still want my mom to take care of me. Stupidly, because she never did it when I was young. Your husband is a grown man. 3 days of food poisoning (you don't say what his symptoms are or how much you've been taking care of him, but I've had it, and it was exhausting and painful and gross) can be brutal, & I'm assuming he's feeling pretty weak. So yes, he could just suck it up, but it's nice to be taken care of when we're feeling shitty... I hope he's hydrating. I had to get 4 bags of fluid when I finally had enough and went to urgent care.
