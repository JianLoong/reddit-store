That's a three hour drive approximately. If he got there at 5:30 pm, they left at 2:30ish. Why didn't he feed his children before he left?

This mostly just sounds like generational differences in \u201chosting\u201d.

Times change.", "ESH - he is the AH for not feeding his children. It\u2019s inconsiderate towards both you and them. What makes him more an AH is him requiring it, despite the fact that he apparently came over unannounced.\nYou are AH because it\u2019s really not too much work to make them a sandwich with *something* as lunch. For example Bread with slices/spread cheese - 5 mins preparation. Or coldcuts on bread. Really not a lot of work. And then it\u2019s for the kids a take-it or leave-it. And it\u2019s just a bit more hospitable. Nobody should expect you to make a 3 course warm meal. Just something simple. A Dutch lunch basically (google it). Yes, he\u2019s an inconsiderate guest, but you\u2019re also an inconsiderate host. \nAlso 8pm dinner is late for young children.

It's a bit weird for them to ask you to cook breakfast before you cook dinner when there's fast food places everywhere. Sounds like bad parenting on their part. Why didn't those poor kids have lunch yet when it's almost dinner time?", "NTA. You were preparing something for guests, dinner at 8.

Secondly, if I were in your cousin's shoes I would have made sure that my kids were fed *before* *arriving to your house* so as not to be a nuisance and a burden, especially knowing that you have dinner relatively late at your house.

He was responsible for the mid-day meal. He should have fed his children at mid-day.\n\nRefreshments or a snack when they arrive is polite hosting. Asking the host to cook a whole separate meal shortly before and in the middle of preparing/cooking a scheduled meal is unacceptable levels of inconveniencing.", "Unfortunately it sounds like many men who are used to women taking care of the children and so trying to hand it off to her as the mother wasn't there to take care of it.", "Same here. My kid would have already gnawed my arm off if I hadn't fed them by 5pm. Even if a late breakfast was involved.", "A) we didn\u2019t invite them.

They are probably getting ready to prep their scheduled dinner at 8. What's being asked is OP prepare an additional meal.\n\nI would agree with you if he just asked for any snacks to tide them over. But cooking essentially breakfast for dinner would also be annoying.\n\nI'm sure the kids barely ate any real dinner since burgers would have filled them right up.", "No, I am the youngest person and I\u2019m 26.", "Agree. You offer guests something as soon as they arrive if you know they had to travel far but kids need food way before 5pm if they only had breakfast. Kids were probably happy about the burgers tho.", "200km isn\u2019t that far really. Assuming they\u2019re driving, it would have been well past lunch before they left their own house.", "He didn't say he wouldn't feed them. He just didn't want to cook, essentially, an extra meal before he starts making their actual dinner. \n\nYes eggs/sausage don't take long. But depending on what you're making that just adds more clutter.\n\nThere was nothing wrong with his request for the father to stop at a burger joint if they were that hungry. He could have said I have something here for them I suppose. But the cousin skipped lunch for whatever reason and is putting the burden on OP. That's not fair or right.", "Couple peanutbutter sandwiches in 2 minutes.", "I assumed he had fed his children since he started his travel at 2pm. So as I had a busy week, I decided to rest for 1-2 hours then get up and prepare something for dinner.", "Well, this puts a decades old thing in a new light. I\u2019ve always felt it was my responsibility as the one driving in to stop for food on the way, because my arrival time can vary by traffic and all so it wouldn\u2019t be fair to expect a meal (unless plans for a meal were made already.)\n\nBack in my late teens/maybe 20 exact, I had a boyfriend break up with me because he arrived at 10pm and I didn\u2019t even consider asking if he was hungry. He didn\u2019t say he was hungry. So I went to bed, got up the next morning, went to work and came home to a letter on my bed breaking up with me. \n\nSo thanks for giving me insight about his perspective, cause I never have understood his logic.", "I just saw the edit so you knew they would be arriving at 5!!!! That s even worse, it would be completely unacceptable in my culture", "They invited themselves according to a comment. They are a burden.", "Well, in my household, it would be impossible because we never keep bread or sandwich meats. Not everyone has the same eating habits as you.", "I don't know if OP is from Southern Europe or from Northern Africa, but in these regions eating at 8 pm is the norm even if you are a child.\n\nMoreover, his cousin left his home at around 2.30/3 pm... this means he didn't fed his own children before leaving nor did he packed some kind of snack or sandwich or stopped to get them something along the way.\n\nOP did offer some snacks, but the cousin felt like he was entitled to a whole cooked meal made by OP. Not even \"do you have something I can cook.for them\", but \"you need to make them something to eat\".\n\nNo, OP's not the AH; on the other hand, a man that invite himself to a relative house the day before and does not feed his children lunch definitely is.", "Ok, first a hint for you: 8pm is a bit late for kids to eat.

It would had been nicer to adjust the time.\n\nFor the rest:\n\n- they came uninvited with short notice\n- he decided to not pack snaks for a 3h trip with kids\n- while drinks and maybe light snacks would be nice if a guest arrives, a full meal (out of regular time) is not (especially not for uninvited guests)\n- kids at 8 and 12 years should be abled to wait 3 more hours (maybe with an apple?) IF they had lunch. (Guess you cousin skipped it)\n\nThis results in **NTA**", "I\u2019m hoping with an 8pm dinner maybe its a culture with a later lunch time? But still, 5pm is wayyy too late to not have eaten mid-day for kids.", "Thats subjective - I live in a densely populated area and 200km, that drive could easily take 3+ hours. \n\nBut agreed, the kids should have had lunch before they left.", "He started his travel at around 2. So around 3 hours way.", "Indeed. If they had been invited, op would had been an AH, but not this way round.\n\n(But keep in mind: that info came later than the vote of *egg*)", "\"That is a smal \"mistake\" in your side. It would had been nicer to adjust the time\"\n\nHe said elsewhere it's a culture thing. Lunch time is typically 2pm and dinner is 8pm.", "Where I live 8 PM is a perfectly normal time for children to eat dinner. A bit on the early side, even.", "Yeah it\u2019s a cultural thing. We eat lunch at 2 and dinner at 8. My cousin started his travel around 2 so I assumed he ate something before his travel.

I really hope they had a late breakfast.", "I\u2019m from Canada. A 3 hour drive isn\u2019t that big of a deal here. My daily commute round trip used to take that long, and I was only 50km from my office.", "So were you not able to offer them any food when they arrived? No snacks? Some light fare?", "Yeah, if they left at 2:00 then they should have eaten lunch before they left.", "I had some snacks like chips and small biscuit but his children wanted a full meal as they were very hungry.", "Oh. Well thats different. \n\nId add the edit if I were you because this reads like you just denied them any and all food until 8", "Oh ok. Maybe I should add other edits as well."]}
