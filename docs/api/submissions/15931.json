I heard someone call out a name and they stopped. Then I noticed that a little girl started crawling into the stall while I was thinking \"what in the actual fucking hell???\" The girl looked about 6 or 7 ish and she was smiling at me???\n\nI immediately got up, pulled my pants up, then flushed so I can get out. I told the girl to get out and asked where her mom is. She pointed to a stall next to mine when a woman came out. I looked at her and said \"do you know what your daughter just did? She crawled into the stall while I was in there. Can you keep a better eye on her?\"\n\nHer mom made a face and told me \"so what? She has autism. You wouldn't know what it's like.\" Which made me mad so I responded with \"yeah and? That's more of a reason to be a better parent and keep her from doing something like this. I'm not mad at the kid. I'm mad at you for acting defensive. For the love of God, don't use her disability as an excuse to be defensive about it.\" Then I turned around and left after I washed my hands.\n\nMy friends asked what took me so long and I explained what just happened.

All because the mum acted in a reasonable way.", "I'm autistic and I wouldn't have been nearly as nice as OP if someone let their child loose to invade my privacy. At six years old she needs to be taught what boundaries are and stranger danger in general. Being autistic is extremely emotionally draining especially as a child but she needed to be confined and if that means a meltdown, so be it.", "Every comment you\u2019ve left is admonishing OP for not having empathy when they\u2019re the one being watched in the bathroom.", "Absolutely. I would do the same but sometimes people snap. Did you start shouting at that mum as soon as she was close enough to hear you? Because I\u2019m SURE that would make a damn difference. \n\nI\u2019ve had strangers go off on me for the most ridiculous things. It\u2019s so deflating. Things that couldn\u2019t be helped when you\u2019re doing the best you freaking can or even things that are not even an issue someone just decided to make it one. No one receives being yelled at well. No one. Did she act appropriately? No. As stated in my original comment. She maybe the AH but she also maybe on her last straw because strangers are awful and butt in inappropriately over nothing. \n\nWhich I understand. There\u2019s NO REASON to just assume and attack people. We have more patients for any other demographic. \n\nI don\u2019t know that persons situation so I\u2019m not going to internet bash her based on 1 side of the story where a person has put themselves in the best imaginable light and still decided to just start shouting at this mum who was TRYING to pee and asked the kid to stop when is reasonably the best thing she could possibly do. \n\nWho knows what OP cut out of the story. Who knows what this mums day has been so nah\u2026 I\u2019m not just going to shit on her.", "You do realise there is a whole spectrum right? Some autistic people can lead relatively normal lives, others like my twins who are non verbal may be able to function but will not understand social interactions or dangers at all.... you don't know where this child was on spectrum. Was child wrong absolutely but OP and mother could have handled it better. But some autistic children will never grasp the idea of danger in general.\n\nSo your suggesting putting a child into a situation where you will cause them anxiety, stress and possible ptsd...", "OP has every reason to be upset and feel privacy was invaded, and that should not have happened.\n\nOver last 3 years I've seen enough of how people treated my sons for even little things to know alot of people don't have any understanding or empathy for the struggles of parents of autistic children. I was screamed at in beging of covid because my child would not wear a mask, was removed from nursery for same reason...", "It's really not about shouting at the mum. I was with my elder daughter (she is 13 now, she was three at the time but I still think about it) in the Disney store. A kid came up to her and grabbed her arm and bit it. I have no idea if that child was autistic. But I was so shocked I burst into tears. (I know that wasn't helpful, I was a young mum then). The mother of the child didn't even apologise. Didn't tell the kid off. So I didn't say a word, but the mother didn't feel the need to make it better.\nMy daughter bit a kid once at baby group and I felt awful. I took her away from the situation and apologised to the mother. Autistic or not, that's what you do.", "\n>So your suggesting putting a child into a situation where you will cause them anxiety, stress and possible ptsd...\n\n\nNo one is suggesting anything other than \"when you take your autistic child to the mall, don't let them lick hepatitis off the bathroom floor\". If watching your child gives them pTsD, then stay home.", "I'm suggesting to parent the child. I understand autism is a spectrum but that doesn't mean you throw in the towel and allow that type of behavior especially because as another person commented, letting your small child share a bathroom stall with a stranger is DANGEROUS! Yes I'm suggesting to allow your child to tantrum rather than invade a stranger's privacy, not teach any social boundaries, and endanger the child.", "And how is OP not displaying empathy for being watched in the bathroom? The mother didn\u2019t accept responsibility or educate her child.", "Again, did you just run up to and shout at the parent? No? Very different response. \n\nI had a lady shout at my kid because my daughter was quietly singing \u201clet it go\u201d on a public train. I\u2019ve had a people accusing me of being \u201cmean and unfair\u201d in front of my child at a store because I said no to a chocolate bar. I\u2019ve had people push my kids out the way to get ahead while they\u2019re following next to me. \n\nYou get over people. Your scenarios are VERY different. You apologise in those situations. Of course you do and you didn\u2019t go on the attack. The parent SHOULD have apologised here as I\u2019ve started BUT I also know what the general public can be like and I understand why someone would respond this way and leave quickly. Probably to cry in the car. \n\nMaybe she didn\u2019t, maybe she doesn\u2019t give a fuck but either way I\u2019ll be the guy on the AITA who says\u2026. Maybe there\u2019s a reason she responded this way.", "Thank you. I couldn't have said it better.", "Watching won't but trigging a meltdown might.... so your suggesting OP and child should never go out?", "I don't think throwing in the towel is what any parent wants. I understand it is dangerous for many reasons, typically we don't use public bathrooms for this very reason.\n\nA tantrum vs meltdown are 2 very different things.\n\nSometimes you can't teach boundaries, yes as a parent you should try to stop such behaviour. \n\nLet me give you an example. I have non verbal twins, one responds to his name will come when called and stop doing whatever he is doing when you sat no, his brother no, will actively walk away from you when you call or talk to him, despite everything he just won't respond unless he wants to. Both have no concept of danger so we have to watch them constantly.\n\nMaking judgements on parent of autistic child is not fair especially if you don't know them or child personally"]}
