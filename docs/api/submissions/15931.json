I told the girl to get out and asked where her mom is. She pointed to a stall next to mine when a woman came out. I looked at her and said \"do you know what your daughter just did? She crawled into the stall while I was in there. Can you keep a better eye on her?\"\n\nHer mom made a face and told me \"so what? She has autism. You wouldn't know what it's like.\" Which made me mad so I responded with \"yeah and? That's more of a reason to be a better parent and keep her from doing something like this. I'm not mad at the kid. I'm mad at you for acting defensive. For the love of God, don't use her disability as an excuse to be defensive about it.\" Then I turned around and left after I washed my hands.\n\nMy friends asked what took me so long and I explained what just happened.
