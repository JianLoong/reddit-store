A lot of things happened when I moved from CA to CO just to live with them, like them not actually even having a place for me to stay when I got here (as in they didn\u2019t actually live somewhere) and then when we got our apartment finally I thought we were good. \n\nWell they don\u2019t really do much around the apartment. I work 2 jobs to afford rent, and I still clean but not as much because it\u2019s hard to do 12 hour shifts and then clean a whole apartment of mess made by a 30 year old adult and their two young kids (6 and 8). \n\nThe first 6 months or so I did regular deep cleaning and organizing, mostly of their stuff bc they have A LOT of stuff, and I watched their kids whenever they asked. Since all that though here\u2019s what\u2019s happened. They usually never clean, except maybe they\u2019ll tackle their pile of dishes in the sink, take the trash if I refuse to, and scrub the bathroom if they have someone coming over. All everything else is left to me. We had a flood, they grabbed towels, and left. Our sink backed up, they wiped the counters. I was the one who moved all the furniture and soaked up the water, and I took everything out from our cupboards and cleaned the sewage water off our cat food container and cleaning products. \n\nOn top of all that they just are messy, leaving stuff everywhere, and they constantly buy new things. They\u2019re always late on rent, and still will buy new expensive items (like a kayak that won\u2019t fit in the middle of our apartment. I could say more but they also borrowed my car and came back with it totaled, though they say it wasn\u2019t their fault. I was done with all of that, it was all a lot for me, especially when I would deep clean and then come in later and their stuff would be everywhere instantly.  \n\nWell this morning at 5 am I hear their kid crying repeatedly, and so I go out there and they\u2019re not home. They left to go to the gym without telling or asking if I was cool, and then left their young kids. I am still waiting for them to come home, but I am so upset. I\u2019ve been considering moving for a while but they would be in financial ruin if I left, and I\u2019m not sure if they would be able to have their kids because idk if they\u2019d have a place to stay. I can\u2019t afford it but being a nanny, emergency wallet, and house maid are all too much for me. \n\nWIBTA if I found a new apartment when our lease is up?", "created_utc": 1691150649, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15hy9f3/wibta_if_i_moved_out_and_left_my_family/", "score": 97, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
