I've had ones that were indistinguishable from regular chocolate peanut butter cups. It'd be incredibly easy for anybody to eat them if they didn't check first.\n\nYesterday he pulled a bottle out of the drink fridge thinking it was pink lemonade. I told him that no, he couldn't have it and explained to him that it was in fact a bottle of pink lemonade flavored alcohol(Smirnoff ice) and that he shouldn't try to drink stuff that isn't his without asking first.", "Eh. I mean, that depends entirely on your relationship with a person. Generally, sure. But I wouldn't think twice about grabbing some random snack off the counter at my parent's house, I'm sure they'd grab something from my cupboards too. Don't think there's anything weird about that from a parent", "Ngl, I still ask to eat or drink anything when visiting my grandparents let alone siblings and friends and strangers. It just seems like the right thing to do. Like what if they have meal plans for that item? Maybe I'm just weird though.", "I mean, I do agree calling the mum is a thief is a bit much, _but_ tbh I don\u2019t think the other guy is far off the mark.\n\nThere is a difference between going to the fridge and then just grabbing whatever you see off the counter. The stuff in the fridge, as far as I\u2019m concerned, is communal (unless otherwise specified) and as such the mum is at just as much liberty as BIL and sister to grab a glass of milk or a fizzy drink from the fridge.\n\nIf something is kept separate, it\u2019s usually for a reason- for example, what if the edibles were intended as a gift for someone else? If I left some stuff I had brought for someone aside and I found out my mum ate it I\u2019d be pretty miffed. I know that wasn\u2019t the case, but the mum didn\u2019t even know what they *were*, as far as she was concerned in the moment, BIL and sis could have had all manner of intended use for the edibles!\n\nI do recognise maybe just leaving them out on the counter it just about the worst place to do so if you want to keep something away from someone, like just put them in a cupboard or something, BIL and sister are pretty dumb on that part, but one sees what one think are sweets on the counter and, without considering why they\u2019re being kept aside, one just goes \u201cI\u2019m having that\u201d?", "I would NEVER let him live it down!  \ud83d\ude06", "The small tin boxes that a lot of Fossil products come in are great for keeping hair ties safe from a furry elastic thief.", "My pup got into my bedroom, managed to open a drawer in the bedside table and proceeded to pull out a plastic container of chocolate covered raisins, open it and eat them. That was not a fun night. And of course he did it after vet office hours on a weekend. \ud83d\ude2d", "My cat used to hide my hair ties under a rug lol", "I used to have a dog that would root through our trash can for tuna fish cans and would chew them like she was a goat, and would growl at me if I tried to take them from her. She was a sweet loving dog but dang she needed a 12 step for tuna fish.", "From OPs description it sounds like it was a foregone conclusion that if candy is out when Mom comes over she is expected to have some, so it's not really theft if they allow it on an ongoing basis. It's basically like the treat container at the doctor's office. If you grab some no one cares just don't pour the whole thing in your pocket. \ud83e\udd2a", "We never let my BIL live down the fact that he came home drunk and cooked and ate some Gaines-burgers (dog food that my MIL had in the fridge) in the middle of the night.  The next morning he told Mom that she made terrible burgers.", "Oh yuck", "Exactly!! I wouldn't do this with, idk, my sister. But my parents? I'll open cupboards looking for a snack when I'm visiting lol, and it wouldn't occur to me to ask permission. I wouldn't expect them to ask me either. \n\n(They might ask, but that's more because I don't have a car/need to get groceries delivered and I think my mother is convinced I just starve when they're not visiting, or something...)", "My wife goes to her Grandmother's house and doesn't hesitate to open the fridge to grab something if she's hungry. I grew up very different. My house was the only fridge I opened without getting permission first. I spent so much time at my aunt's I was practically her fourth son, I still asked before I grabbed Ice for a glass of water (also asked for the glass and to use the tap) If I wanted soda or something I brought it with me and asked I if could put it in the fridge for game nights and such. Same at both sets of grandparents. My mother would have had my head otherwise.", "HAHAHA!!  I had a friend who, whenever she came back from the bars a little tipsy, would whip up disgusting spur of the moment meals out of whatever was around.  One night she made refried bean wraps and snarfed those down. The next morning she noticed that she still had an almost full can of beans left and thought she really didn't eat that much.  THEN. she noticed the empty cat food can... \ud83d\ude01", "I grew up solidly middle class in a smallish Midwestern town. I had friends that were much better off than my family, and friends that could actually be described as poor. I found it to be almost universally true that those with less were much more willing to share and have an open-fridge-door policy than those that were so much better off financially. I believe it's a cultural thing. Those with less take care of each other. Those with more tend to pinch pennies and keep control over their cabinet doors.", "If you have a policy of that, then it was already discussed.  That's the same thing as asking, just in advance.", "I think my mom would cry if I asked her permission for food at her house.", "Why is this downvoted?!", "Customs obviously vary, but in OP's family, it doesn't seem to be considered out of line. My family is somewhere in-between. When I visit family, they usually tell me what I can help myself to, and otherwise, I ask. I do the same in reverse when someone visits me. Some families are much more familiar with each other; very likely they live closer together and see each other often, so have expanded from my family's style to an even more open one. Your family's style is equally valid; just different.", "But where do your snacks live?\ud83e\udd7a", "Presumably the mother has visited more than once in her life and it has been established whether or not it it ok for her to take food without asking permission.", "Yea my family never struggled for money or food, if I started asking my mom for permission to eat normal stuff (if it was something special that's different) would probably really upset her.   She would feel like I didn't feel at home anymore when I visited.", "Pfffffffft sure bud", "Um.. apparently it's not ok since she ate a bunch of weed and ended up in the er.", "Why are sweets special?  My best friend's mom always had candy about and I've been getting into that without asking since I was 5 yrs old.  She never thought it was rude and told me to help myself.", "It's almost like we all have different experiences and no one way of interacting is the correct or polite way.", "you were teached? By a taughter, no doubt", "They used the word greedy though. It sure seems like they see one way as correct and polite."]}
