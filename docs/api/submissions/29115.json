If edibles aren't a big deal, then why all the fuss on her end about the truth being told?\n\nThe only reason she is upset is because she and her husband (rightly) now have to look bad to your father instead of you.", "NTA, your sister and BIL are both jackasses tho", "NTA\n\n>She said that I made her husband look bad \n\n...but had no problems trying to make you look bad.", "NTA. Why on earth would you be TAH for not taking the fall for your sister for no reason?\n\nYour mom should stop eating random shit she can\u2019t read, btw.", "NTA - not even a little bit:\n\n*She said that I was a bad brother because she knew what out dad is like, and that edibles aren't even a bid deal to be angry about.*\n\nThen why is she having you take the blame if isn't a big deal?

What's in it for you?", "You're the only one NTA in this situation. Your BIL shouldn't have left his shit out when he knows his in-laws are anti-drug and judgmental. Your mom shouldn't have eaten shit that didn't belong to her. Your dad shouldn't be so close-minded. Your sister is the biggest asshole, because she threw you completely under the bus and then had the gall to be mad at you when you cleared your own name. \n\nAll you did was stand up for yourself and tell the truth and not let your sister get you into trouble.", "NTA - You Dad needed to know the truth about what happened as well as the ER.  Hiding such carelessness from your BIL from your Dad absolves BIL for this and that shouldn't be.  What if your Mom had wandered outside and had an accident?

If weed gummies aren\u2019t a big deal (and I don\u2019t believe they are) then your sister can grow up and own their mistake. Hopefully they\u2019re childfree because leaving that out is absolutely stupid. Whether it\u2019s weed gummies, vitamins, melatonin WHATEVER.

So you are a bad brother because you did not like that she lied to get an easy out. Your mom is a bad mother for having a panic attack.\n\nAnd your sister?

You weren't the one to blame, and if they know that your mother is known for eating anything left out then they should be held responsible for leaving it out.", "NTA. If your sister knows what your Dad is like, how is it fair that she would unfairly subject you to his anger? \n\nIf your mother felt bad enough to call an ambulance, it was not an over-reaction to do so. She did not know what she had taken or why she felt like this, so it was prudent to be checked out immediately.

I would have told your father too.", "NTA- she needs to take responsibility for her own actions. Not you.

That being said, your mother may not be able to read, but there are warnings on every package of edibles that have cannabis plants put right in the label. She just got greedy and shoved food in her mouth she didn\u2019t even look at.

No hun, if honesty makes you \u201clook bad\u201d, it\u2019s because you *are* bad, that\u2019s all on her. \n\nBasically it sounds like your sister and her husband were irresponsible and didn\u2019t want to take responsibility for their actions.
