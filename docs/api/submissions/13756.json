My best friend is now going through a divorce, which leads to me and him taking turns with her while the other is working if daycare isn\u2019t open.

She constantly complains about her husband and occasionally leaves her children without asking. It has made me not want to play in my own yard. I\u2019ve talked to her several times and she didn\u2019t seem to understand that occasionally I didn\u2019t mind, but daily was to much. Well yesterday it came to a head. She walks over when I\u2019m playing with my goddaughter and she walks over and ask what I\u2019m doing for my birthday. I discuss it for a second before my goddaughter ask for a drink. So I excuse myself and take her to get a drink. I hear my neighbor knock on the door so i say one min. Then I see her 8 year old carrying her toddler towards me. I ask where her mother is and she says (mom said she would be right back). Well if you read my last post you know why I would be sensitive too this. I instantly go to the back yard. She is nowhere to be found. So I call her husband and tell him if she\u2019s not back in 5 mins. I\u2019m calling the police. This is where i might be the asshole. She comes back and starts complaining that being a mother is the hardest job in the world. I cut it off instantly and say that it\u2019s not and even if it is I never agreed to be one. She called me a asshole and left.
