Nothing was salvageable. He didn't have insurance. I'm a SAHM to 3 kids. Our youngest is rowdy as hell. He's currently being tested for ADHD. We allowed BIL to stay here, despite me hating this guy. He's been here a week and hasn't been back to work because he's currently \"too depressed\". My husband works 12-16 hour days, depending on the job that day, and is gone a lot- leaving me to deal with the BIL day in and day out. He's currently staying in the guest room. \n\nFor the past 2 days he has been making comments. Every time I sit down, he will make a comment about me being lazy. He's laughing when he says it. Clearly thinks he is making some sort of great joke. Not sure if it pisses me off because I already hate him or not, honestly. But the tip of the iceberg definitely hit full force today. My son is off the walls and just being a handful in general and my BIL keeps making comments to him and telling him to calm down, be quiet (\"will you shut up?\"), or even following my son around outdoors telling him he's a brat. I tell him to stfu multiple times and stop speaking to my son at all. I then go to make my kids lunch and BIL comes out and says \"where's mine?\" I tell him he's a grown ass man who can cook his own food. He goes \"ain't you the woman of the house?\" I ignore it. But then my husband comes home on his lunch break and he tells my husband \"she ain't much of a womanly type is she? Couldn't even make me lunch.\" Again, says it while laughing and \"trying to be funny\" but I've had it at this point and told him to get the fuck out of my house. He looks completely blindsided, as if he hasn't been purposely pushing my buttons all day with my kid or me in general. My husband, who already was given the run down on a \"one more thing and he's gone\", did back me. He's also spoken to BIL about the comments but it's always a \"she can't even take a joke, I was just playing\". BIL says \"I ain't got no where to go!\" So I told him to go live on the street with the garbage for all I care. \n\nHe takes off. I told my husband under no circumstances is he welcome back here with his sexist comments and trying to parent my kid. He thinks I may be taking this too far due to how much I already hated the guy and given the fact that I'm currently 30 weeks pregnant and already irritable and says he feels bad because his brother has nothing right now.", "created_utc": 1688748075, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14tce3g/aita_for_kicking_my_bil_out_of_my_house_after_his/", "score": 92, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That was his chance to keep his mouth shut and be a bearable houseguest.  He is in your house all day and being a complete ass. \n\nDon\u2019t let anyone tell you pregnancy is clouding your judgement here. I also would have kicked him out of my house.", "NTA. You gave him a place to stay, but he can't even put in the effort of giving the slightest amount of respect? What you did is not \"too far\", that's what you get when you treat people as if they're your servants.", "BIL was bullying you and your son. If he thinks he is such a comedian, maybe he can get a job as one.\n\nIt seems there was no end in sight with how long he was planning staying. BIL wasn't making effort to help out in the house. If he has no place to go, he should have been a better guest.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "> \"I ain't got no where to go!\" \n\n\"Not my fault, not my problem, You're a guest, have the decency to bahave like one.\"\n\nNTA", "NTA.

Under no circumstances shoud he be allowed back. If he has a key to your home, change the locks.", "NTA...You are entitled to reasonable enjoyment of your own home.  He enjoyed your generosity for a week while making no attempts to fix his life or show you respect.  He's going to have to find another solution to his problems.", "NTA!\nHis house burnt down. He is not disabled. He can find a job and stay at a motel. Or find a rental. \n\nYour BIL seems entitled and disrespectful and uses his \u2018jokes\u2019 to convey those feelings. \n\nHave a heart to heart with your husband and don\u2019t let issues with BIL create problems in your marriage.", "Background first - Did brother just say he had no home insurance, or did he really have no insurance? Unless the house is mortgage-free, the lender requires insurance. If he really had no insurance while mortgaged, he's super screwed. He owes the lender his outstanding balance. This affects you because it means he'd be living with you for a LONG time.\n\nAnyway, you certainly did not over react. BIL well deserved to be kicked out and you were patient beyond measure.

NTA he deserves neither your kindness or respect.", "NTA. The entitlement from your BIL REEKS and gawsh the sexism. His house might have burnt down but using that as an excuse to treat someone who has been gracious to him is just unacceptable and you did the right thing.", "NTA - Another case of \"It was just a joke\".  Once MIGHT be a joke.  More than once is never a joke.  You are clearly within your rights to kick him out.  If he needs a place to stay maybe he can act like a grateful person instead of an AH.", "You already hated this guy for a reason. Sounds like there are plenty of reasons to choose from. \n\nDefinitely do not let him back in. What an AH.", "NTA.  Pretty dumb to needle the person who is giving you a break and these are the consequences.", "NTA. He is a bully. Do not tolerate his behavior for any reason.", "NTA you are entitled to peace in your own house.", "NTA  And let me tell you why. BIL sounds like a real piece shit. First of all, he's mooching off you and your husband after his house burned down. That's unfortunate, but it doesn't give him the right to disrespect you or your household.\n\nMaking comments about you being lazy? Laughing it off like he's some kind of comedic genius? Yeah, that's not cool. And it only gets worse when he starts targeting your kid. Telling your son to shut up, calling him a brat, and following him around? That's crossing the line who tf is he to do that anywys.\n\nBut the icing on the cake is after everything that went down when he has the audacity to insult you directly by questioning your womanhood and your ability to make him lunch. That's some sexist bullshit right there, and you have every right to kick his sorry ass out of YOUR house.\n\nYour husband did the right thing by backing you up, u have every right to set boundaries and protect your family from toxic behavior, especially when you're pregnant and dealing with all sorts of emotions.\n\nBIL needs to learn some respect and take responsibility for his own actions. And if he has nowhere to go, well, tough luck for him. He shouldn't have burned bridges and pushed your buttons all day long.", "> He goes \"ain't you the woman of the house?\"\n\n>\"she ain't much of a womanly type is she? Couldn't even make me lunch.\"\n\nGee, I can't possibly imagine why he's single, lol.\n\nNTA. There's helping out someone in need and there's being completely taken for granted. Really glad your husband backed you up here.\n\nYour BIL should have been nothing but grateful, helpful and extremely considerate of you and your family. He chose otherwise and now is reaping the natural consequences of his actions.\n\nIf your husband is having any kind of doubts, remind him that your children are all watching how he treats you and are internalizing those messages and further, the stress he is putting you under and the effects that could have on your pregnancy.", ">\"she can't even take a joke, I was just playing\".\n\nYou can tell it's actually a joke if both people are laughing.\n\nNTA. BIL is a jerk who can't even muster the brains to realize he needs to play nice with the people who're helping him out.", "So... let me get this straight; your BIL \\[husband's brother\\] didn't have insurance on his house and it burnt down. You and your husband offered for him to stay with you guys. \n\nWas there a specific time frame discussed here? i.e. did you two say, you can stay, but for only X amount of time?\n\nHe has decided to blow off work for a week, because his house burnt down and wants to sit around and berate you and your child instead? \n\nPersonally, I think he's probably just taking advantage of you two and just decided to stop working since he's got all his needs met right now.\n\nYou're pregnant, taking care of a family and a home while being berated and this AH wants to act like it's a joke? Nah... unacceptable. What's going to happen in 8-10 weeks when you're in the hospital giving birth? What's going to happen when you have a newborn and a rambunctious young one around? I wouldn't want additional people there for sure!\n\nHis brother has nothing, because his brother is stupid and sexist. Don't let anyone say that this is on you and your hormones. I'm NOT hormonal and just a single comment would make me tell the guy to pound sand.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the record, my daughter \\[now 20\\] is ADHD, yes it can be a handful to deal with and with a newborn in the mix, it will be exhausting. Without a supportive spouse, it'll be worse. My son is 5 years younger than my daughter. When he was a newborn, my husband helped me A LOT. Therefore, I could handle it all, but without any sort of backing, I'd have lost my damn mind. You cannot be responsible for an ungrateful, sexist grown ass man on top of it all.", "NTA.  If I was the BIL, I would look at my hard-working pregnant SIL with 3 active kids and a hard-working brother and go out of my way to help. I'd help with the kids, do laundry, see if anything around the house needs fixing. Mow the lawn. Clean up after meals. Of course, I'd also would have had homeowner's insurance and been working to get a place to stay. But that's just me.", "Classic case of biting the hand that feeds him.\n\nBut all these gender norms \"jokes\" and you didn't once call him unmanly for choosing not to work? You didnt tease him for demanding wifey effort from someone else's wife(riding his brothers coattails lol)? Opportunity missed to fight fire with fire.", "Absolutely NTA bil took things wayyyy to far and his demeanor whether joking or not is not fit for any kind of joke.  I praise you for the amount of patience you had.", "NTA at all. No houseguest, regardless of the circumstances, has a right to speak to you like that. He should be grateful for the shelter you\u2019ve given him.", "NTA\u2026the nerve of some people.  I have sympathy for his situation but no sympathy for his attitude.   You shouldn\u2019t have to deal with that type of disrespect in your own home.  Kudos to your husband for backing you up.", "NTA. Kick him out and get on with your life. If you are in the US, the American Red Cross can often assist in finding temporary accommodations.", "NTA. His bank most likely did not burn down too so should have money in his acct.  at least should had saved for his rent or mortgage and other monthly bills.  He also has a job with income coming in.  He can find some place to stay.   He is NOT trying to get back on his feet. He is trying to stay off  them as long as possible.", "NTA. He had plenty of chances and he wasted all of them. He sounds charming so he shouldn't have any trouble finding a womanly woman to take care of him.", "NTA you where kind and let him stay with you and he acted like that. no way would I let that slide especially with him trying to parent ( yell ) at your kids and be mean to both them and you.", "NTA. He sucks.", "When you're a sexist deadbeat who's too much of an idiot to get insurance, you shouldn't bite the hand that feeds you. NTA", "NTA\n\nYou already did so much by letting him stay with you. He should have been more appreciative rather than being an AH. With his kind of attitude, it's no wonder no one else will take him in.", "NTA.  You have three kids and are baking a fourth.  He should be so grateful to have a place to stay that he is offering to cook for you, not insisting you treat him like another kid.   \n\n\nAlso, no one tells my kids to shut up.   They'd literally be more likely to survive calling my kids AH than telling them to shut up.   I would have called THAT my final straw.", "NTA that man is insufferable, and absolutely disgusting. NEVER let that man back in your house. Your husband needs to protect his family.", "So many stories recently about people with burned down houses living with in-laws.\n\nAre arsonists about?", "NTA. Your BIL was able to control his AH behavior for 5 days and then just let it hang out. Kick him out and no second chances.", "NTA.\n\nHe needs to be grateful that you allowed him to stay in your house in the first place. He needs to learn have manners, he really needs them.\n\nBIL is a total asshole who took things way too far. Good job on handling this, OP!", "NTA rude house guests find themselves in short supply of accommodations.", "NTA.  BIL played a stupid game and won a stupid prize.  Glad your husband backed you!  And no, you're not taking it too far.  BIL should be thankful and respectful under your roof.", "NTA\n\nAt thirty weeks pregnant I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t slap the shit out of him when he called you lazy.", "I just let out a MASSIVE cheer!\n\nAs I was reading through I was expecting a different ending and was SO delighted to hear you took such powerful action! \n\nYour peace and the peace of your husband and your children must be preserved at any cost. You\u2019re already coping with a LOT. That you took him in at all shows how caring you are. \n\nAny decent human would be bending over backwards to make life as easy as possible for you, given your kindly gesture. \n\nSadly, your BIL has not an ounce of humility or self awareness. He learned today that that comes at a cost. \n\nWell done. Truly truly well done. You are a warrior of a woman! \n\nNTA", "NTA.  I wonder what BiL said to provoke whoever burned his house down.", "NTA I was gonna say YA because whilst the guy is an asshole kicking family onto the street after a huge diaster like that is kind of bad. But with how he is acting and making a comment like \"aint you the women of the house\" is crossing soo many lines. Like yea there is grief and some people use humor to get over grief even if the humor is bad BUT it should never just default to sexism unless that is already his views. Plus you are 30 weeks pregnant so even with grief he should know that purposefully upsetting you and stressing you out is legitimately bad for the unborn baby inside of you. So entirely I would say NTA. But as a middle ground I would help work with your husband (because he must be worried for his brother I know he is an asshole but he is also family) and find someone elses couch he can surf on for a bit until he gets on his feet. But in an already stressful house you dont need someone purposefully pushing your buttons.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But that is likely not the case which is why I said a middle ground like helping to find him another house mainly for the sake of the husband to prevent his worries aswell. If I was the husband I would never let him stay in the same house as my wife again but I would also atleast make sure he has a roof over his head even if its just a tent. Plus his house burning down must have been a tramatic time so adding in extra fuel to the pity fire can lead to disastrous far reaching consequences. So unless he is an utter thrash human there should be a way back for him (and again it does not excuse any of his behavior it just makes sure he doesnt cross that line).", "Best comment right here \ud83d\udc4c"]}
