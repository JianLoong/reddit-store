NTA amy can shove her opinion somewhere else. if she wants to comment, than against racism", "NTA, I like the insult", "She is fairgame as long as she still bullies you. Call her sexist words, if she can dish it she can take it.\nNTA just make sure you know what words mean when you talk to non racists idiots.", "NTA I think it's hilarious and fitting for someone racist.", "Almost all English-language swear words relate to genitalia. It's something we're completely ok with being used as an insult. NTA.", "Not sure if this is UK but if it is people call each other twats all the time and I would never consider it sexist. Is it sexist to call someone a dick ? \n\nNTA obviously.", "NTA exactly what a racist deserves.", "To answer this question:\n\n>I might be an asshole since I used an insult without knowing all of its meanings.\n\nNo. You're not the AH if you didn't know what it means, but you should definitely be more careful. I understand you because English is not my first language and I sometimes learn new words from movies... that don't sound too terrible but when I look them up I find out that they're racist/sexist/... So don't use any words unless you knew their exact meaning.\n\nI would say though that, of course, she's an AH for bullying you and you certainly have the right to stand up for yourself, but you could've used a better approach.", "She sounds really warped.\nThat is a top insult.  Good on you for standing up for yourself.  \nThe verdict oughtta be E S H because lowering yourself to insult her wasn't the high road... but gee I don't blame you.  You should likely report the bullying to a resposible adult.", "lmao", "Your response was hilarious \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 hopefully that bully stops bullying you anymore.", "Absolutely NTA, you didn't know what it meant and she is saying idiotic stuff. (Oh ThE jAPanEsE diD 9/11) no, sweetie, they did not. This is why I say the American School system is garbage.", "NTA bullies are twats. You just pointed it out", "I mean for future reference make sure you always know the full context and meaning of a word before saying it. You don't want to accidentally insult someone you like. \n\nHowever in this scenario, absolutely NTA. Very tame compared to what I would have said.", "This girl has a full baby diaper where her brain should be.  You're NTA for standing up for yourself, and what you said isn't sexist (but is another word for vagina.)\n\nI would just quietly leave a copy of Hooked on Phonics on her desk, or in her locker, along with library books about 9/11, Hiroshima, and whatever other mashup of words she used.  Maybe also a map with places marked off - like Japan, China, and Korea as I am certain this idiot doesn't know they're different places.", "It\u2019s not sexist. If your friend told you that she is probably already infested with woke virus. Standing up for yourself against a bully is always a good thing. I mean she is openly racist and probably illiterate since all the things associated with 9/11 can easily be googled. Either that or she is willing to state absolute nonsense just to bully you for whatever reason. So yeah NTA. Though in the future you should probably know what a word means before you say it (give u a pass cuz u r a kid we\u2019ve all been there).", "sounds like she likes you and she doesn't know how to sort her feelings out. \n\nNTA", "Not gonna lie, love the insult, though maybe without that last slur.\n\nNow, with English not being your first language and not understanding slang terms or slurs, I\u2019d say NTA, especially since you were the one being bullied in the first place.\n\nHOWEVER, if the bullying continues, then try going through the proper channels to either stop or limit the bullying.  If it doesn\u2019t work, it may be time to transfer schools, if at all possible", "ESH\n\nJust some childish namecalling. But if you're going to do that anyway, why bother with restraint. Use whatever insult you feel has the biggest impact - but using any at all already makes you an ahole too.", "When you\u2019re insulting someone, you\u2019re being an asshole on purpose.\n\nTell her you\u2019re sorry you were imprecise\u2026 she\u2019s a bully and since you can\u2019t hit people at school all you can do is hope she turns her violence inward if you want to be harsh.\n\nBut be careful about conflating mutual dislike with being bullied.\n\nMy bully put so much syrup of ipecac in my drink I vomited blood.\n\nYou got called some names.", "Using words that might have hidden meanings can be a problem. When you called her a name, it might have hurt her because that word isn't nice. Even if she was saying rude things, it's important to try and use words that aren't mean or hurtful to anyone. Just try to be careful with the words you use.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Ok with this girl being extremely racist to OP but as soon as he says something tangentially related to her she feels the need to call him out? Screw that.

It is a term created for and by Black people that other people misuse and misunderstand.", "OP's words can be seen as childish namecalling but that girl calling his country a terrorist state and accusing his country of the attack on the World Trade Center is way worse than that, especially considering Japan is a major non-NATO ally. They did some terrible stuff during WW2 but the people who committed those atrocities are mostly dead and dying.", "Completely depends on the person, being called names and racist names at that for years can have a terrible effect on a person,  leading to depression etc just because the person is not being physically bullied does not lessen the effect it can and does have in many.
