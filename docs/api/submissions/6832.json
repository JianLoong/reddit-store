Now if I get a larhe amount of business like this - especially if the student turns out to be the type that is fun to teach - I will definitely tell my friends about it...", "If the client thought her \"rush\" rates were reasonable, I don't blame her for not discounting future services. And we don't know if there were other reasons for charging higher than her usual rates--such as very particular pet care requirements. For example, if he had multiple dogs and each one had to get a specific diet and not eat any of the other dogs' food. (I don't have a dog but know people who seek advice on how to manage that.) Or if some of them needed long vigorous walks and the others needed very easy walks so she couldn't just take all of them out at once. If that were the case, I could see why he would be willing to pay more and that she would be foolish to charge the same as for easier clients.", "If the client dropped her, it means he found a better price elsewhere", "But in this case, the client could have done their due diligence and looked up what the going rate was for these services.\n\nIt sucks the client was taken advantage of but also\u2026 caveat emptor.", "I do some freelance work, and my new clients pay more than my established clients.\n\nThat's because the market rates have risen over the decade I've been freelancing, and I don't automatically raise my rates for my most established clients. Partly this is because I don't have to spend a lot of non-billable time determining their stylistic preferences or negotiating scope of work, partly this is because they don't expect rush work, and partly this is because they've taught me a lot about business and introduce me to new clients. They're good at scheduling orders during my slow season, too. (I've had some lousy customers who would get estimates that included AH fees if they approached me again, but that hasn't happened.)\n\nBut new customers, who need stuff on short notice during my busy season and send files that I can't open? Yeah, they get rush fees on top of full market rates. And delivery fees if applicable.\n\nI don't have family, but if one of my close friends decided to tell one of my newer clients that I was charging my most loyal client from 10 years ago much less than they pay, I would be FURIOUS.\n\nThere is no law saying freelancers have to charge all customers the same with no extra charges for being on call, rush jobs, etc. or discounts for being super easy to deal with (or being senior, disabled, etc.). Maaaybe if someone were being charged extra for being a member of a protected group (and there was no actual business reason like last-minute bookings or difficult pet care situations) that would be discrimination.\n\nOP, YTA for butting into your sister's business.", "Very simple - maybe the friend had extenuating circumstances that still warrant a higher rate despite it being good business", "Did her stepsister say \"overcharging\" in so many words, or is that just OP's interpretation? If this client needs more specialized service than her other clients, \"he pays me so much more than my other clients\" (to put it neutrally) could be perfectly justified. Or maybe she undercharges a lot of folks because they're elderly etc. and she doesn't have the heart to charge full price for someone on Social Security who needs pet care while they're in the hospital.", "That's the problem with only having one side of the story. This is why Judge Judy at least gets both sides before deciding who's the asshole", "Trick question.  They're all AH on Judge Judy ;)"]}
