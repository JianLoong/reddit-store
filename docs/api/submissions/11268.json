You told them what would happen, and yet they are shocked that you followed through. If people cannot accept a completely reasonable rule, then they do not respect you.", "They aren't even paying rent? Wow. They are 100% taking advantage of you. For living in a large house they should be super grateful and abiding by whatever rules you have. NTA", "Let me get this straight. They couldn\u2019t get a rental in their budget so the compromise was to move in with you and only give you $100 for their groceries? You need to kick them out if they don\u2019t technically now have tenants/squatters rights where you\u2019re located.

I fear they are using you.", "NTA\n\nThey're disrespectful in addition to taking advantage of you.

It sounds like part of the problem is that they don't like being in the situation, and rather than feeling grateful to you, they resent you for having the house to rent.

They contribute next to nothing, so they don't have any right to challenge you or give you that attitude.", "NTA - you need to get that bad energy out of your house now!

Yeah, your house, your rules. Not following the rules is careless and stupid, but how you respond to those situations says more about you than them. Obviously they are in the wrong, but now they obviously trying to compensate and you got your intended result: they are worried. Are you happy with your own reaction?"]}
