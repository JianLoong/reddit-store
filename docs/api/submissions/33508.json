I think the longest conversation I've had with a pizza guy has been \"DwayneBaroqueJohnson?\", \"yeah\", \"here's your pizza\", \"thanks very much\"\n\nEDIT: Also, NTA, but everyone else has covered that part", "NTA.  Your husband is an asshole.  Is he telling strangers where you hide the spare key?  Where you keep the petty cash?  Does he leave the keys in his car with the doors unlocked? Does he tell randoms how much money you have in the bank? \n\nYour husband is a moron.  Announcing to strangers that you will be on vacation and that a female will be housing sitting is beyond stupid.  It\u2019s stupid and dangerous. \n\nI have plants that have more sense.  Hard to believe that someone is this stupid.", "NTA. He told a random stranger your presumedly young niece would be there ALONE for several days? Man needs to watch some Dateline or something. SMH.\n\nYou telling him in private obviously wasn\u2019t getting the point across so maybe doing it in front of an audience will.", "NTA.\n\nIf the strangers didn't know your address then whatever. But the pizza delivery guy? That seems excessive.\n\nIt's hard to fathom your husband's motivations here. Why does he need to tell these people? Based on his comment that \"only you could be so paranoid,\" and the fact that he's kept doing it after you've asked him to stop, I'm guessing he's doing it in part to needle you. If so, it's probably in retaliation because he's feeling defensive, shamed, or controlled to reject his way of living in favor of your more \"paranoid\" (in his view) way of living. Not a cool or mature reaction on his part, and not your fault. But there are things you can probably do to help fix the situation, if you want to.\n\nIn particular, instead of asking him to change his habits or behavior, try just telling him your feelings about it. \"I'm sensitive to X so can you help me with this?\" tends to be received a lot better than, \"I think X is bad/stupid so can you stop doing it?\" Again, not saying you're wrong, just saying that there are ways to communicate that are particularly persuasive and less likely to arouse defensiveness. People don't like to feel like the things they're doing are stupid, even if they are stupid.\n\nHope this helps!", "NTA.  Your husband is an idiot of the first order.  He's not smart enough to be trusted with adult information.  He's walking around begging strangers to take advantage of him, you, your niece, and anyone else who could be hurt.\n\nThe pizza guy and anyone else he told are probably telling everyone about the moron who told them when they would be gone. He also looks like a simpleton for bragging to anyone who will listen that he's, can you believe it, actually traveling somewhere.\n\nHow did he get to adulthood without being at least a little self-aware.   I had a relative who did this when his family was going on a vacation he was excited about. He was 5 years old. His parents taught him about over-sharing and safety.  He's six now and knows better.", "NTA. Your husband is dense as fuck.", "NTA does your husband WANT your house to be robbed and your niece traumatized?? I can't believe he's so unaware that he'd tell the pizza delivery person... seriously!! Your husband is a complete idiot.", "I hear your reasons for not telling (and I agree) but what are his reasons for telling these total strangers? \n\nAt the least they do not care, medium they think he is a braggart and your scenario is the worst.\n\nNTA", "Nta the wet bandits would have loved him.", "NTA. Why doesn't he just go on Facebook and announce it to everybody or Instagram give them the dates the times everything that way every burglar in the area knows when you're not going to be there. Yeah he is delusional.", "NTA\n\nIt's not paranoid. It's basic safety. Don't create easy opportunities for people to rob you. Eventually, you'll meet someone who can't resist walking through that open door.\n\nHe might trust people, but he wouldn't walk around handing out his routing and account numbers, right?\n\nWhat's your address, I'll come talk to him for you. Just let me know when you aren't going to be home so I don't miss you.

Where you going? Address?", "NTA\n\nWhere are you headed? I was in Costa Rica last January, it was awesome.\n\nI only tell close family and friends about vacation plans ahead of time.  I don't post anything on social media about the trip until after I get back.  And I certainly wouldn't tell a stranger ahead of time, especially if they know where I live.\n\nI don't think that's paranoia.  Your husband is being too carless.", "NTA, but your husband is. Did you mention a young woman is staying there to pet sit? Is he intentionally setting her up for an assault? I would tell the woman to not come because she might be in danger. It must be nice to be a man and not have to live your life in a way that constantly takes into consideration the danger of SA. I hope you have a home security system.", "NTA. You\u2019re not paranoid, you\u2019re conscientious. \n\nFurthermore your husband isn\u2019t just setting you up to be burgled, he\u2019s setting you up to be burgled with a young, lone woman in the house. I\u2019d be **livid** and asking her and her parents if they\u2019re still okay with her house / pet sitting after your husband has told half the neighbourhood that you\u2019ll be away, but your young niece will be home. \n\nTo be honest, I\u2019d be livid and terrified if I were the niece too and if something happens, could you forgive yourselves?", "NTA. There is no reason to be so careless about home security. And, above all, insist on saying these things if your wife asks you to stop.", "NTA. I won\u2019t even post pics until after I\u2019m back from vacation.", "NTA. He's a fool putting you and your niece in danger. I'd tell him if it happens again you aren't going on the trip. Someone needs to protect your home and niece from the dangers he's created.", "NTA Your husband is shockingly naive. I thought this was common knowledge. At first he was just an idiot but the tantrum and then informing an absolute stranger that there's going to be a young woman/girl all alone in your house for such and such dates makes him a huge asshole. You need to let your niece (and her parents if she's a minor) know about this incredible lapse in judgement. I'm in my 30s and I'd rethink our arrangement if I found out someone I was house sitting for was being so cavalier with my safety.", "NTA. He could very well have endangered your niece. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a big city or little town. Rape and murder happen everywhere. It\u2019s just common sense to keep that to yourself and those who have to know. He acts very naive to think nothing can happen.", "Does he like to go around telling people his mother\u2019s maiden name, the street he grew up on and the school he went to? Hey, what\u2019s his birthdate?", "NTA \nYou should also point out how dangerously stupid it is to notify people that a female will be fully alone on x and x dates.", "NTA. Tell him to act like he\u2019s been on vacation before. My wife posted pictures from Sea Grove, Florida on FB and someone immediately stole my generator and lawn tractor. \n\nYHITA", "NTA. Talking about a trip is one thing but why does he insist on giving out the dates, esp. after you asked him to stop? That's the least he could do! Damn! God forbid anything happens to your niece, it would be DIRECTLY his fault!", "Please tell your niece what he has been doing in case she wants to cancel. I would not house sit if I were her shoes. It sounds like he is telling even more people about your travel plans because you asked him not to. That's crap. Sorry you are married to an ass. NTA.", "NTA.  Guess he wants to be robbed???", "NTA! He went too far by telling them the exact dates and that your niece would be there alone! An empty house with only your niece is a predators dream!!", "NTA. That\u2019s a strange amount of information to give to stranger even if someone is excited.", "FFS. Your husband needs to tone it down. I don\u2019t understand how he can possibly think he\u2019s doing anything right or reasonable by announcing travel plans to strangers. \nNTA and your husband needs to get his shit together.", "NTA. Might as well just put a sign outside the house saying \"No one will be home during these dates.\"", "In terms of security, this is as basic as it gets.\n\nIt's bad enough that he was doing it with repair people, but he did it with the pizza guy AFTER you asked him not to?\n\nNTA, but your husband sure is.", "NTA, and I'd make sure your niece knows not to let anyone in, there are no repairs or anything else she needs to worry about, no friends who.ight try to surprise you, etc. I'd also be sending him to the police station so he can hear about what kind of crimes happen in your tiny town, it's probably something he'll find surprising.", "Nta why is he telling random people about your vacation?", "NTA. Your husband is an idiot. I hope you aren't going to continue with the plan of having your niece pet sit since your husband just put her in possible danger. You need to find different accommodations for your pets. It's not safe.", "Loose lips sink ships.  If the wrong kind of person hears when a home is vacant, its an invitation to get robbed.  Or come home to find squatters.  You married a nonchalantly stupid man who thinks it will happen to someone else.  His behavior is practically courting disaster.  NTA", "What the fuck is wrong with him?", "Was the pizza delivery guy Joe Pesci? NTA but don't make a movie out of this...", "NTA, what he is doing is dumb. I can break into your house for you and teach him a lesson, of course I'll return everything after you're back \ud83d\ude09", "NTA your husband is a fool.", "NTA your husband is basically ensuring your home gets broken into. Ask him if he\u2019s going to leave the keys under the doormat too.", "NTA - The whole point of strangers is you don't know them.\n\nIt doesn't matter where you live, where you're from, etc. I come frome such a tiny place, we never locked out doors. We still didn't volunteer to strangers that we were leaving from this date to that date.", "NTA - the risks out way the benefits.\n\nHe is excited for the trip and wants to brag about it but he is putting your family at risk. What if you get robbed? What if it happens when your niece is there and he gets hurt or worse. It\u2019s so easy to keep your mouth shut to protect your house. Why can\u2019t he talk about it when you get back?\n\nRobberies happen everywhere. I live in a very safe town with a plethora of police that often like to hang out across the street from me and yet my neighbors car was broken into earlier this year. \n\nMy aunt and uncle came home to find their house was in the process of getting robbed and it was the scariest thing ever. The guys robbing them had guns. \n\nIt\u2019s not worth going the possibility of going through something like that just to tell the pizza delivery driver your going on a trip.", "NTA.  It certainly could be a safety concern.  Maybe he could tell people once you get back where you were.", "Put everything you don\u2019t want stolen in storage. Enjoy your vacation. When you get the call that your front door was found kicked in, kick him in the balls.", "NTA you might want to call your insurance agent & up your policy for theft.", "Get Ring cameras all over the outside before you leave. Big deterrent. Easy to set up.", "NTA\n\nYou ate concerned for the safety of your property. If you don't know you can trust the people he's telling, then that puts your propriety in jeopardy. He should not be doing that", " NTA! Dang\u2026doesn\u2019t he have any sense of security?", "NTA. My husband does this too. Drives me insane!! We were in New York staying at a hotel, as we were heading out for breakfast he tells housekeeping our teenage daughter was sleeping in the room by herself please do not clean it. I lost my mind and needless to say breakfast was cancelled.  He still doesn\u2019t get why it\u2019s an issue.", "NTA", "He told strangers that his niece will be staying there alone. Doesn\u2019t he care about her safety? That is not about you being paranoid about being robbed. This is about the welfare of a young woman. Before you go you need to get cameras around the house, and make sure your niece knows to call 911 for anything she feels unsafe about. He\u2019s excited about a vacation, what is he 5? It might be time to cancel the vacation until your husband can handle going out of town. This is not only wrong, but scary.", "NTA! I would lose it. Do you all have a good security system so your niece is safe?", "NTA.  Your husband is telling strange men that his niece will be there all alone for a week.  And nobody will hear her scream.\n\nIf that doesn't scare the bejezzuz out of him, nothing will.  He's TAH", "NTA! Bloody hell! You didn\u2019t marry an A H, you married an idiot! Not sure which is worse!!", "Has your husband never watched Home Alone?!?", "NTA. Hasn\u2019t he seen home alone?!?", "NTA", "Where are we going and what are the dates?", "NTA, someone has not seen Home Alone and it shows.", "NTA - There is no reason for what your husband did. Just why?", "NTA and definitely get a house sitter.", "Awhile back we had a dish network installer here caught casing houses he was in for later theft.  Helping people know you will be away for an extended period is dumb.", "NTA\n\nWhen ya\u2019ll get back from vacation and find the place robbed, be sure to remind him whose fault it was that the thieves knew you were gone. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "This is like #3 on literally every \u201chow to be safe during the holidays\u201d article in history. Your husband is a dipshit.", "NTA. Tell him the housesitter fee or the security system upgrade comes from his fun money budget.", "Why is your husband telling complete strangers  such personal business? They really don't care. Does he have ADHD?\n\nI'm on your side, OP. NTA.", "Isn\u2019t that the plot of Home Alone?", "NTA It's a safety issue. Even in safe small towns. Especially when he's talking to people who have been to your home. Announcing that your niece will be there alone is a bigger issue.\n\nIf he thinks it's no big deal, but you clearly do, then why does he feel the need to keep telling people knowing it upsets you?", "NTA, if you don't have cameras I would get some now! Get something like Ring or Arlo, and give your niece access while she's there.", "NTA\n\nHe thinks it\u2019s \u201cparanoid\u201d to not want to announce to the world exactly when you won\u2019t be home? \n\nYou don\u2019t have any friends who are cops or prosecutors or anything, do you?  It might help to hear some stories of what happens when people broadcast what they own and how others can easily take it.", "NTA\n\nUnless he has a mental challenge of some type, it almost sounds like Husband WANTS your home to be broken into, vandalized, and robbed. Do you have particularly excellent insurance that will pay him enough to retire, or is something going on that he hasn't told you about?", "NTA. Lock up your valuables at a friend's house and make sure your niece can defend herself, maybe with pepper spray or something.", "NTA. He\u2019s acting incredibly stupid. No one should announce to ANYONE, aside from close friends or relatives WHO ARE HELPING THEM CARE FOR THE HOME WHILE AWAY, should know you\u2019re going on vacation beforehand. It\u2019s a very real thing that predators look for vacant homes to ransack or even move into temporarily while people are away.. even a troubled youth who is a friend of a friend could learn you\u2019re away and decide it\u2019s a good idea to go hunting for valuable at your place while you\u2019re gone. Maybe that pizza boy is sitting with his homies later on and one of them isn\u2019t such a great guy and makes a comment about needing some money, and the pizza guy says, \u201chey I know a house that these people told me they\u2019re leaving for vacation for a week\u2026.\u201d Like your husband is just being ignorant and his privilege is really showing by just assuming bad things will never happen to him\u2026. So annoying. Again, NTA.", "He has to intentionally be doing that, where on earth in a pizza drop off would your vacation naturally come up in conversation?\n\nBig NTA. It's a reasonable ask and he's continuing to ignore your request.", "NTA your husbands also a dumbass", "Nta it\u2019s none of anyone\u2019s business I\u2019m surprised he didn\u2019t volunteer your bank account information or why not tell them about your sex life\u2026I would be pissed also \ud83d\ude44", "NTA reminds me of my friend who was with her husband dropping their child off at a birthday/slumber party. On the way there she said to make sure to lock the vehicle even though the distance from the driveway to the front door was very close. This was because her handbag was in the vehicle. He brushed it off (\u201cyou\u2019re paranoid about the purse but ok\u201d).\n\nShe unloaded the child and they both handled the gift and slumber party items. He left the vehicle unlocked and someone ended up stealing her handbag in those few seconds.\n\nSo of course *she* has to go through the process of getting new credit cards and IDs while he sheepishly says sorry and doesn\u2019t have to do anything to remedy that situation.", "NTA\n\nI'm probably the least paranoid person and if this was me - I wouldn't allow my  niece to house sit. What he is doing is very unfair to you but especially to your niece.\n\nI live in a very safe and thankfully boring town where emergency vehicles are  more often than not the Santa parade or the 4th of july or something, and I would be very upset if my husband did this.\n\n(When I saw the title of the post, I imagined him talking to strangers at the supermarket or something innocuous).", "NTA.

Total stranger, knows where you live, etc. Nice neighborhood or not, when that info gets \u201cleaked\u201d then yeah it\u2019s a cause for concern cause someone IS aware.

Whether or not your husband has a big mouth. My parents are Peruvian so they would drag us to Peru every summer and our home would be empty. I remember back in the 90s my dad had a book on what to do to fool thieves and stuff like light and radio and TV timers but it\u2019s not gonna fool a good thief and your neighbors who I\u2019m sure will notice and stuff will be a dead give away cause its gonna be a game of \u201cfind the one that is not like the other\u201d (my dad told me car and driveway activity are a dead give away too..essentially patterns).

His reasoning was if they left the door open then it's an invitation for anyone to visit.", "Some places you can still do that. Albeit all very wealthy and homogenous places", "Seriously though. If you\u2019re traveling overseas, consider holding onto his passport for him.", "Yes definitely don't forget the drool cup!\ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\ude01", "<< I\u2019ll make sure he\u2019s holding the small bills, and a cup to drool into apparently. >>\n\n\ud83d\udc51\ud83d\udc8e\ud83c\udfc6\u2764\ud83c\udfc5", "I hope you have security cameras!", "I cackled \ud83d\udc80", "If you look in old newspapers every event that gets mentioned includes the address. I have relatives who were going on vacation and the article in the 1970s era paper mentioned the parents being out of town, the address of the home, how many kids were staying there, and the relative who came to chaperone. When my grandmother had her appendix out it said, \"Susie Smith of 567 Street Lane is in the hospital recovering from appendix surgery. She is expected home by the end of the week.\" Luckily they didn't mention where the spare key was hidden...", "   That was happening when my mom suddenly passed away 30 years ago. Dad hired a friend of a friend to be at the house.  We made sure that all the doors were locked. A lady at our church had her son drive around the neighborhood about every 15-20 mins. Down the back alley, which was always busy. \n   So yes it does happen.", "Hah!  There's a lot of kids in our neighborhood including older teens/young 20s.  Mostly good kids, but they're very social and have their friends over all the time.  Since I don't know the kids well or their friends at all I figured it's best just to keep it to ourselves.\n\nI do know and am neighborly with the parents.  But because some of the kids are truly young adults and able to be home alone the parents will go off on weekend getaways and leave the kids home who then bring over their friends.  Figured why tempt fate?", "I'm not worried about family because they are all far away, but I always give my next door neighbor a heads up when I'll be away. He's happy to keep an eye open (he has a young dog and is out walking the dog many times a day) and also collect any unexpected packages. I do the same for him.", "We rarely go away but I have neighbours across the road who frequently go off for weekends.  We live in a very quiet street, but if anybody walked down here regularly enough, they would know that my neighbours usually have a huge caravan parked out the front, and if it's not there, the house is probably empty.\n\nMy neighbours always tell me when they are going away and how long they'll be away.  I mean, I'd know anyway with the huge empty space in their driveway but it's nice to have the communication.  We also discuss things like bins going in and out.  Nice neighbourhood relations.", "[deleted]", "Yeah my grandma lives in a small wealthy farm town and she\u2019s never locked her door a day in her life, keeps her key in the car etc and everyone in town knows she a little old lady that lives by herself and they def all know when she\u2019s on vacation bc she will not be volunteering at the local thrift store like usual. I do think the sherif (one of two cops in the town LMAO) will do drive by\u2019s for her when she\u2019s gone but generally speaking I don\u2019t think they have like any crime other than speeding from people not from said town. I loooovvveeee visiting but I still lock my car door and for someone reason it drives ger nuts lol.", "Yeah I have heard of having someone housesit so burglars can't use the funeral announcement as a shopping list, at least the decoy of leaving lights on, vehicle parked, etc as if you were home", "Quite literally people have been robbed by their Facebook \u2018friends\u2019, I am not interested in being one of those people.", "[deleted]"]}
