I think the longest conversation I've had with a pizza guy has been \"DwayneBaroqueJohnson?\", \"yeah\", \"here's your pizza\", \"thanks very much\"\n\nEDIT: Also, NTA, but everyone else has covered that part", "NTA.  Your husband is an asshole.  Is he telling strangers where you hide the spare key?  Where you keep the petty cash?  Does he leave the keys in his car with the doors unlocked? Does he tell randoms how much money you have in the bank? \n\nYour husband is a moron.  Announcing to strangers that you will be on vacation and that a female will be housing sitting is beyond stupid.  It\u2019s stupid and dangerous. \n\nI have plants that have more sense.  Hard to believe that someone is this stupid.", "NTA. He told a random stranger your presumedly young niece would be there ALONE for several days? Man needs to watch some Dateline or something. SMH.\n\nYou telling him in private obviously wasn\u2019t getting the point across so maybe doing it in front of an audience will.", "NTA.\n\nIf the strangers didn't know your address then whatever. But the pizza delivery guy? That seems excessive.\n\nIt's hard to fathom your husband's motivations here. Why does he need to tell these people? Based on his comment that \"only you could be so paranoid,\" and the fact that he's kept doing it after you've asked him to stop, I'm guessing he's doing it in part to needle you. If so, it's probably in retaliation because he's feeling defensive, shamed, or controlled to reject his way of living in favor of your more \"paranoid\" (in his view) way of living. Not a cool or mature reaction on his part, and not your fault. But there are things you can probably do to help fix the situation, if you want to.\n\nIn particular, instead of asking him to change his habits or behavior, try just telling him your feelings about it. \"I'm sensitive to X so can you help me with this?\" tends to be received a lot better than, \"I think X is bad/stupid so can you stop doing it?\" Again, not saying you're wrong, just saying that there are ways to communicate that are particularly persuasive and less likely to arouse defensiveness. People don't like to feel like the things they're doing are stupid, even if they are stupid.\n\nHope this helps!", "NTA.  Your husband is an idiot of the first order.  He's not smart enough to be trusted with adult information.  He's walking around begging strangers to take advantage of him, you, your niece, and anyone else who could be hurt.\n\nThe pizza guy and anyone else he told are probably telling everyone about the moron who told them when they would be gone. He also looks like a simpleton for bragging to anyone who will listen that he's, can you believe it, actually traveling somewhere.\n\nHow did he get to adulthood without being at least a little self-aware.   I had a relative who did this when his family was going on a vacation he was excited about. He was 5 years old. His parents taught him about over-sharing and safety.  He's six now and knows better.", "NTA. Your husband is dense as fuck.", "NTA does your husband WANT your house to be robbed and your niece traumatized?? I can't believe he's so unaware that he'd tell the pizza delivery person... seriously!! Your husband is a complete idiot.", "I hear your reasons for not telling (and I agree) but what are his reasons for telling these total strangers? \n\nAt the least they do not care, medium they think he is a braggart and your scenario is the worst.\n\nNTA", "Nta the wet bandits would have loved him.", "NTA. Why doesn't he just go on Facebook and announce it to everybody or Instagram give them the dates the times everything that way every burglar in the area knows when you're not going to be there. Yeah he is delusional.", "NTA\n\nIt's not paranoid. It's basic safety. Don't create easy opportunities for people to rob you. Eventually, you'll meet someone who can't resist walking through that open door.\n\nHe might trust people, but he wouldn't walk around handing out his routing and account numbers, right?\n\nWhat's your address, I'll come talk to him for you. Just let me know when you aren't going to be home so I don't miss you.

Where you going? Address?", "NTA\n\nWhere are you headed? I was in Costa Rica last January, it was awesome.\n\nI only tell close family and friends about vacation plans ahead of time.  I don't post anything on social media about the trip until after I get back.  And I certainly wouldn't tell a stranger ahead of time, especially if they know where I live.\n\nI don't think that's paranoia.  Your husband is being too carless.", "NTA, but your husband is. Did you mention a young woman is staying there to pet sit? Is he intentionally setting her up for an assault? I would tell the woman to not come because she might be in danger. It must be nice to be a man and not have to live your life in a way that constantly takes into consideration the danger of SA. I hope you have a home security system.", "NTA. You\u2019re not paranoid, you\u2019re conscientious. \n\nFurthermore your husband isn\u2019t just setting you up to be burgled, he\u2019s setting you up to be burgled with a young, lone woman in the house. I\u2019d be **livid** and asking her and her parents if they\u2019re still okay with her house / pet sitting after your husband has told half the neighbourhood that you\u2019ll be away, but your young niece will be home. \n\nTo be honest, I\u2019d be livid and terrified if I were the niece too and if something happens, could you forgive yourselves?", "NTA. There is no reason to be so careless about home security. And, above all, insist on saying these things if your wife asks you to stop.", "NTA. I won\u2019t even post pics until after I\u2019m back from vacation.", "NTA. He's a fool putting you and your niece in danger. I'd tell him if it happens again you aren't going on the trip. Someone needs to protect your home and niece from the dangers he's created.", "NTA Your husband is shockingly naive. I thought this was common knowledge. At first he was just an idiot but the tantrum and then informing an absolute stranger that there's going to be a young woman/girl all alone in your house for such and such dates makes him a huge asshole. You need to let your niece (and her parents if she's a minor) know about this incredible lapse in judgement. I'm in my 30s and I'd rethink our arrangement if I found out someone I was house sitting for was being so cavalier with my safety.", "NTA. He could very well have endangered your niece. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a big city or little town. Rape and murder happen everywhere. It\u2019s just common sense to keep that to yourself and those who have to know. He acts very naive to think nothing can happen.", "Does he like to go around telling people his mother\u2019s maiden name, the street he grew up on and the school he went to? Hey, what\u2019s his birthdate?", "NTA \nYou should also point out how dangerously stupid it is to notify people that a female will be fully alone on x and x dates.", "NTA. Tell him to act like he\u2019s been on vacation before. My wife posted pictures from Sea Grove, Florida on FB and someone immediately stole my generator and lawn tractor. \n\nYHITA", "NTA. Talking about a trip is one thing but why does he insist on giving out the dates, esp. after you asked him to stop? That's the least he could do! Damn! God forbid anything happens to your niece, it would be DIRECTLY his fault!", "Please tell your niece what he has been doing in case she wants to cancel. I would not house sit if I were her shoes. It sounds like he is telling even more people about your travel plans because you asked him not to. That's crap. Sorry you are married to an ass. NTA.", "NTA.  Guess he wants to be robbed???", "NTA! He went too far by telling them the exact dates and that your niece would be there alone! An empty house with only your niece is a predators dream!!", "NTA. That\u2019s a strange amount of information to give to stranger even if someone is excited.", "FFS. Your husband needs to tone it down. I don\u2019t understand how he can possibly think he\u2019s doing anything right or reasonable by announcing travel plans to strangers. \nNTA and your husband needs to get his shit together.", "NTA. Might as well just put a sign outside the house saying \"No one will be home during these dates.\"", "In terms of security, this is as basic as it gets.\n\nIt's bad enough that he was doing it with repair people, but he did it with the pizza guy AFTER you asked him not to?\n\nNTA, but your husband sure is.", "NTA, and I'd make sure your niece knows not to let anyone in, there are no repairs or anything else she needs to worry about, no friends who.ight try to surprise you, etc. I'd also be sending him to the police station so he can hear about what kind of crimes happen in your tiny town, it's probably something he'll find surprising.", "Nta why is he telling random people about your vacation?", "NTA. Your husband is an idiot. I hope you aren't going to continue with the plan of having your niece pet sit since your husband just put her in possible danger. You need to find different accommodations for your pets. It's not safe.", "Loose lips sink ships.  If the wrong kind of person hears when a home is vacant, its an invitation to get robbed.  Or come home to find squatters.  You married a nonchalantly stupid man who thinks it will happen to someone else.  His behavior is practically courting disaster.  NTA", "What the fuck is wrong with him?", "Was the pizza delivery guy Joe Pesci? NTA but don't make a movie out of this...", "NTA, what he is doing is dumb. I can break into your house for you and teach him a lesson, of course I'll return everything after you're back \ud83d\ude09", "NTA your husband is a fool.", "NTA your husband is basically ensuring your home gets broken into. Ask him if he\u2019s going to leave the keys under the doormat too.", "NTA - The whole point of strangers is you don't know them.\n\nIt doesn't matter where you live, where you're from, etc. I come frome such a tiny place, we never locked out doors. We still didn't volunteer to strangers that we were leaving from this date to that date.", "NTA - the risks out way the benefits.\n\nHe is excited for the trip and wants to brag about it but he is putting your family at risk. What if you get robbed? What if it happens when your niece is there and he gets hurt or worse. It\u2019s so easy to keep your mouth shut to protect your house. Why can\u2019t he talk about it when you get back?\n\nRobberies happen everywhere. I live in a very safe town with a plethora of police that often like to hang out across the street from me and yet my neighbors car was broken into earlier this year. \n\nMy aunt and uncle came home to find their house was in the process of getting robbed and it was the scariest thing ever. The guys robbing them had guns. \n\nIt\u2019s not worth going the possibility of going through something like that just to tell the pizza delivery driver your going on a trip.", "NTA.  It certainly could be a safety concern.  Maybe he could tell people once you get back where you were.", "Put everything you don\u2019t want stolen in storage. Enjoy your vacation. When you get the call that your front door was found kicked in, kick him in the balls.", "NTA you might want to call your insurance agent & up your policy for theft.", "Get Ring cameras all over the outside before you leave. Big deterrent. Easy to set up.", "NTA\n\nYou ate concerned for the safety of your property. If you don't know you can trust the people he's telling, then that puts your propriety in jeopardy. He should not be doing that", " NTA! Dang\u2026doesn\u2019t he have any sense of security?", "NTA. My husband does this too. Drives me insane!! We were in New York staying at a hotel, as we were heading out for breakfast he tells housekeeping our teenage daughter was sleeping in the room by herself please do not clean it. I lost my mind and needless to say breakfast was cancelled.  He still doesn\u2019t get why it\u2019s an issue.", "NTA", "He told strangers that his niece will be staying there alone. Doesn\u2019t he care about her safety? That is not about you being paranoid about being robbed. This is about the welfare of a young woman. Before you go you need to get cameras around the house, and make sure your niece knows to call 911 for anything she feels unsafe about. He\u2019s excited about a vacation, what is he 5? It might be time to cancel the vacation until your husband can handle going out of town. This is not only wrong, but scary.", "NTA! I would lose it. Do you all have a good security system so your niece is safe?", "NTA.  Your husband is telling strange men that his niece will be there all alone for a week.  And nobody will hear her scream.\n\nIf that doesn't scare the bejezzuz out of him, nothing will.  He's TAH", "NTA! Bloody hell! You didn\u2019t marry an A H, you married an idiot! Not sure which is worse!!", "Has your husband never watched Home Alone?!?", "NTA. Hasn\u2019t he seen home alone?!?", "NTA", "Where are we going and what are the dates?", "NTA, someone has not seen Home Alone and it shows.", "NTA - There is no reason for what your husband did. Just why?", "NTA and definitely get a house sitter.", "Awhile back we had a dish network installer here caught casing houses he was in for later theft.  Helping people know you will be away for an extended period is dumb.", "NTA\n\nWhen ya\u2019ll get back from vacation and find the place robbed, be sure to remind him whose fault it was that the thieves knew you were gone. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "This is like #3 on literally every \u201chow to be safe during the holidays\u201d article in history. Your husband is a dipshit.", "NTA. Tell him the housesitter fee or the security system upgrade comes from his fun money budget.", "Why is your husband telling complete strangers  such personal business? They really don't care. Does he have ADHD?\n\nI'm on your side, OP. NTA.", "Isn\u2019t that the plot of Home Alone?", "NTA It's a safety issue. Even in safe small towns. Especially when he's talking to people who have been to your home. Announcing that your niece will be there alone is a bigger issue.\n\nIf he thinks it's no big deal, but you clearly do, then why does he feel the need to keep telling people knowing it upsets you?", "NTA, if you don't have cameras I would get some now! Get something like Ring or Arlo, and give your niece access while she's there.", "NTA\n\nHe thinks it\u2019s \u201cparanoid\u201d to not want to announce to the world exactly when you won\u2019t be home? \n\nYou don\u2019t have any friends who are cops or prosecutors or anything, do you?  It might help to hear some stories of what happens when people broadcast what they own and how others can easily take it.", "NTA\n\nUnless he has a mental challenge of some type, it almost sounds like Husband WANTS your home to be broken into, vandalized, and robbed. Do you have particularly excellent insurance that will pay him enough to retire, or is something going on that he hasn't told you about?", "NTA. Lock up your valuables at a friend's house and make sure your niece can defend herself, maybe with pepper spray or something.", "NTA. He\u2019s acting incredibly stupid. No one should announce to ANYONE, aside from close friends or relatives WHO ARE HELPING THEM CARE FOR THE HOME WHILE AWAY, should know you\u2019re going on vacation beforehand. It\u2019s a very real thing that predators look for vacant homes to ransack or even move into temporarily while people are away.. even a troubled youth who is a friend of a friend could learn you\u2019re away and decide it\u2019s a good idea to go hunting for valuable at your place while you\u2019re gone. Maybe that pizza boy is sitting with his homies later on and one of them isn\u2019t such a great guy and makes a comment about needing some money, and the pizza guy says, \u201chey I know a house that these people told me they\u2019re leaving for vacation for a week\u2026.\u201d Like your husband is just being ignorant and his privilege is really showing by just assuming bad things will never happen to him\u2026. So annoying. Again, NTA.", "He has to intentionally be doing that, where on earth in a pizza drop off would your vacation naturally come up in conversation?\n\nBig NTA. It's a reasonable ask and he's continuing to ignore your request.", "NTA your husbands also a dumbass", "Nta it\u2019s none of anyone\u2019s business I\u2019m surprised he didn\u2019t volunteer your bank account information or why not tell them about your sex life\u2026I would be pissed also \ud83d\ude44", "NTA reminds me of my friend who was with her husband dropping their child off at a birthday/slumber party. On the way there she said to make sure to lock the vehicle even though the distance from the driveway to the front door was very close. This was because her handbag was in the vehicle. He brushed it off (\u201cyou\u2019re paranoid about the purse but ok\u201d).\n\nShe unloaded the child and they both handled the gift and slumber party items. He left the vehicle unlocked and someone ended up stealing her handbag in those few seconds.\n\nSo of course *she* has to go through the process of getting new credit cards and IDs while he sheepishly says sorry and doesn\u2019t have to do anything to remedy that situation.", "NTA\n\nI'm probably the least paranoid person and if this was me - I wouldn't allow my  niece to house sit. What he is doing is very unfair to you but especially to your niece.\n\nI live in a very safe and thankfully boring town where emergency vehicles are  more often than not the Santa parade or the 4th of july or something, and I would be very upset if my husband did this.\n\n(When I saw the title of the post, I imagined him talking to strangers at the supermarket or something innocuous).", "NTA.

You ruined the trip before you even left.", "YTA when he talks to people outside and you make a fuss. I\u2019ve included travel plans to people outside before as small talk while on line at a grocery store or post office and stuff. Nothing wrong with that.

Total stranger, knows where you live, etc. Nice neighborhood or not, when that info gets \u201cleaked\u201d then yeah it\u2019s a cause for concern cause someone IS aware.

Whether or not your husband has a big mouth. My parents are Peruvian so they would drag us to Peru every summer and our home would be empty. I remember back in the 90s my dad had a book on what to do to fool thieves and stuff like light and radio and TV timers but it\u2019s not gonna fool a good thief and your neighbors who I\u2019m sure will notice and stuff will be a dead give away cause its gonna be a game of \u201cfind the one that is not like the other\u201d (my dad told me car and driveway activity are a dead give away too..essentially patterns).

Yeah if it\u2019s not \u201cfriends\u201d (the electrician that came to my old home was a trusted family friend and he knew when we would be out but our landscaper is a \u201cstranger\u201d so they didn\u2019t know our plans during off season and stuff) , then completely NTA.", "Tell him that and apologize for it. Do not apologize for the message. He should not tell anyone, ever when you'll be going on vacation. That's inviting trouble. Tell the niece to be extra careful of strangers while she is pet sitting. Have him read this!  He may have put her in danger.", "Maybe husband should put a sign on the lawn \u2026\u201dWe\u2019ll be gone to \u2018location\u2019 until 0/0/0. Come and see us when we get back so you can see all our photos!\u2019 \u201c.  NTA.", "This was exactly what jumped into my head. OP, please make sure your niece and her parents are aware of this extra security risk so the she can make an informed decision if she still wants to housesit. If I were your niece I would definitely not be comfortable there alone now.", "He\u2019s a guy. SO MANY MEN go through life never having to actively consider their own safety. It\u2019s not surprising.", "It was absolutely improper and unsafe for him to say that - I completely agree with everything you said. How could that guy be so naive???", "This is a recipe for disaster, no matter how safe is the town where you live, there are always bad seeds lurking.", "THIS. When I used to pet sit often, I would take a Lyft to the house where I'd be sitting and the driver would ask what I was up to, what my plans were for the weekend, making small talk. But I never said that I was pet sitting, just \"oh going to stay with a friend for a few days.\" I never got bad vibes from the drivers, but just wanted to be on the safe side. I would be PISSED if I was the niece and knew he was telling people all that info.", "He might not. This may sound really dumb, but I could see myself doing this when I was younger. For context, people where I grew up only locked their doors if they were going on vacation - and if they could find the key. It was very rural.\n\nIt sounds like he is quite excited for this vacation. That is really sweet and nice to hear! lol", "You\u2019re completely right. I\u2019ve written down some great points from these responses, your mention of the safety-conscious mindset is one of them. I think I\u2019ll be able to convey my points a lot better now.", "It really isn\u2019t that far off. When I explained the safety issues with revealing info like that combined with the fact that people generally don\u2019t care, he was bewildered.", "Crocodile Dundee had \u201cOutback smarts\u201d and a knife.  A _big_ knife.", "That\u2019s where the frustration came from, I wasn\u2019t sure if he was deliberately doing it or if he\u2019s just dense. He\u2019s a total travel amateur and didn\u2019t know it\u2019s generally not good to over share these things so I looked past it the first few times, but he looked at me like I was an alien when I said it\u2019s generally not a good idea to announce travel plans to random people.", "Yea that's what I don't get.  I can see being like \"we're going on a trip soon! YaY!\" and not really worrying about that, but who the hell gives out dates?  That's just weird.", "Fair enough.", "JFC, OP, DON'T ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS!!!!", "I know but I'm responding to the comment about a woman not being safe on her own.", "Wow, that is so fucking stupid of him", "Do you really think it's *certain* that she's \"ruined the trip\"? You can't imagine there's anyone out there who might be a bit annoyed for a while about being told off and then get over it, talk it out with their partner and still have an enjoyable time in Mexico?", "Yes. Agreed. Maybe the niece can have a friend or two stay with her. \n\nPeople who over share about vacation plans are saying \u2018feel free to rob me while I am away\u2019 \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f!\n\nIf u/nomadicandrew needs proof the hubby can look at these videos/read the stories.\n\n[Georgia Couple Robbed After Posting Vacation on Facebook](https://www.fox5atlanta.com/video/1109592.amp)\n\n[Florida Home Burglarized After Posting Vacation Photos on Facebook](https://www.live5news.com/story/13558680/couple-burglarized-after-posting-vacation-plans-on-facebook/)\n\n[California Home Burglarized After Owner Posts Photos While Vacationing In Vegas](https://abc7.com/archive/9482852/)\n\nI post vacation photos on Facebook several weeks after I get home.

She was house sitting for her aunt and uncle when two friends came to visit \u201cleft\u201d and ended up taking her life.", "Seriously?  My parents live in the middle of no where, have an alarm and would never EVER do something as stupid as your husband is doing.  It's not about being rural, it's about being reckless and ignorant.  People in small towns still get robbed.  All. The. Time.", "Only the *wrong people* care!", "Even if he thinks your reasoning is wrong - there is not a good reason not to accomodate your request - These people do not know either of you.  \n\nHe can say - so excited visiting x for the first time - but to continue with dates in just being disrespectful to you", "He\u2019s telling everyone when will be a great time to break into your house and steal all of your stuff, and when there may be a girl or woman alone in there to be attacked. I don\u2019t know how old your niece is, but yikes, he\u2019s endangering her.", "You\u2019re gonna have your hands full while on vacation. I\u2019m visualizing him walking around town (for whatever reason, I\u2019m thinking Rome) and all of the pick pockets are fighting each other for the chance to rob him blind.", "Even if he doesn't understand the reasoning, he understands it upsets you. That should be a good enough reason to stop. He's also telling strangers your niece will be there alone on these dates. That's a big no-no!", "I did say that, however, I didn't say women shouldn't live alone. Violence against women is a huge problem wherever we are, but we live with it because we have to. Yes, women who live alone should take safety precautions, IMO, but the truth is women are killed more often by their domestic partners than by strangers.", "I was just speaking with a woman who was robbed while she was away. It was some dude from the gym! She let her vacation plans slip and he looked up her address.", "My sister used to announce on Facebook that she and her partner were en route to visit family.  I told her last year that she had announced on Facebook that her apartment was empty.  She had not put 2 and 2 together.", "I\u2019ll make sure he\u2019s holding the small bills, and a cup to drool into apparently."]}
