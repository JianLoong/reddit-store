I took off work to be there for her engagement because it was a very special moment for her and I am also taking time off to go to all her wedding festivities and her wedding. I work shift work and don\u2019t get a lot of vacation, so many days I will be missing will be without pay.  \n\nI got engaged a month ago and we want to get married next year Oct 2023. We bought a house together last year and are excited to finally tie the knot! Before congratulating me on the engagement (which she never did anyways. The only thing she said to me was that she was shocked) she was talking to our friends saying she would be upset if we got married the same year as her. She wants all the attention and everyone\u2019s focus to be on her (I didn\u2019t know this yet). We have different friends and there would be maybe 4 people attending both weddings. \n\nOnce our venue was booked, I told her we were going to get married Oct 2023  and how excited I was! I told I was excited that we could plan together and share ideas and vendors, and ultimately move into the next chapters of our lives together. She immediately said that she can\u2019t be apart of the planning for my wedding as she is very stressed out about her wedding. That\u2019s fine, I get that. I told her not to worry about my wedding and that the only thing that\u2019s important to me is that she\u2019s standing beside me on my wedding day. She has since blocked me from all the planning for her wedding. \n\nYesterday I told her what day we will be getting married and she said she will be on call that day and since she started this new job she won\u2019t be able to have her on call shift switched with someone else. I thought this was ridiculous that with a years notice, she isn\u2019t able to have the day off. She said she had made prior commitments and used vacation for those other commitments already. She is not going to put the effort in to try and make it to my wedding. I expressed how upset I was that she won\u2019t be attending the biggest day of my life and she got mad at me for being upset. She never directly told me that she didn\u2019t want me to get married the same year, I heard it from a mutual friend.

There was one wedding each month from April to August. And, another in October.

The other is the 17th grandchild born on the 13th. So 13 and 17 are my two lucky numbers!\" (Mind you, she plays those two numbers every week for the lottery.) Well, my cousin got married in November 1982 (which upset my mother tremendously, since it was HER wedding month) on the 13th day (which is HER lucky number.) How DARE my cousin use that day as her wedding day and she married... an Italian man. Not just any Italian guy in Brooklyn, but a \"just off the boat Italian!!\" (My mother was enraged that she married an Italian.) \"She did aaaaaallll that, just to spite me: MY wedding month, MY lucky number for the day!!\nSigh... my mother still holds a grudge.

The fact that she is then pathetic enough,after all those years of friendship and everything you have done and gave up for her, to then be such a spiteful and hateful person (would call her something else but not sure on the rules on swearing) shows you that she was never truly your friend.

Stop spending time, energy, and money on this person. She\u2019s not your friend. She WILL drop you from her wedding so it\u2019s best you leave now on your terms. Screw her.
