Growing up she would always come to me for help with things our parents wanted her to do alone or for money, because I had money young from helping out my best friends grandparents who would always throw us five or ten dollars for doing stuff for them. But my sister was a very popular kid and had a bunch of friends who were popular and I was not. So she never liked being seen with me. When we got older it was worse because she'd ask to borrow money or she'd ask me to drive her home from school but if I dared approach her around her friends she'd get so mad and say it was embarrassing to be seen with me. She and her friends used to make fun of me and my best friend too because he's a guy and they would say we were either secretly dating or he was secretly gay. She'd throw out some wild shit just to fit in. It annoyed the crap out of me because she'd always want something when none of her friends were around. I'd say we weren't at all close in that time despite me giving in normally because I did love her but she was shitty to me and to my friend.\n\nAs adults who are now 26 and 28, I would say our relationship got better eventually and she seemed to improve a lot as a person. She even apologized to me and my best friend for going along and spreading more rumors about us. She even asked me to be her maid of honor which shocked me because I didn't ask her to be mine. I thought we were finally starting to be close as sisters. But she started treating me like shit again. She wanted me to change my hair completely (my hair is pink and all textured), then she wanted me to cover up the two tattoos I have (one of which represents my kids) and told me I looked like a biker and not a bridesmaid. When we went dress shopping she'd always have something negative to say about the dresses they had me try while she was crazy about her friends dresses. After a few months she told me she felt like I would be too distracting on her wedding day and would I mind being a regular guest and not a bridesmaid. Something clicked for me then and I told her not to worry about me being a distraction because not only would I step down as her maid of honor, but I will keep myself away from her wedding and do her the kindness of not being there when she's clearly still embarrassed of me like she was as a kid.\n\nShe freaked out and said she never said she didn't want me there. She told me I'm her sister and I should be there. My parents were SO disappointed when they learned what happened but said they understood my decision and it was probably for the best overall. My sister's fiance accused me of holding the past against her and overreacting to what she wants for her wedding day and I should do better.

She asked me to step down as maid of honor but she did ask me to be a regular guest. So the decision not to go 100% came from me. It might be an overreaction or me behaving childishly to past hurts and not just what's going on now. I could potentially be wrong for how I have responded to all of this.

Which to be clear, that would be okay to do, despite what he says. But you're not. You clearly demonstrated that you accepted her apology, and have been willing to move forward in your relationship. What you're doing is holding her present behavior against her. She hasn't changed, she's the same judgmental bully she was growing up. The only thing that's different now is that she is aware of how bad it'll make her look if you're not at the wedding, that's why she's so upset. It has nothing to do with any \"love\" she has for you.", "She's probably worried about how she'll look at her wedding if you're not there.

These characters have shown to change (then again, magic of tv shows).\n\nThe Ops sister however shows she hasn\u2019t changed at all, maybe kept false pretenses when she hit her adult years in order to appease everyone, and as soon as she felt comfortable around Op, more than likely she acted up and expected Op to be pushed around again so things can go back to how they were before where she uses Op by belittling her infront of her friends and companions.", "If (very big if) you do decide to hear out an apology from her you should only do so after the wedding.\n\nA lot of things would need to be said there, including her explaining why her behavior was wrong, what motivated it, and steps she has taken to be a better person, for it to considered a sincere apology.\n\nBut the prospect of her only doing so to save face at her own wedding is too big to ignore. Her doing it after would be the only way to demonstrate that the apology is about her regretting the way she treated you and not about her own wants.\n\nAgain, that\u2019s only *if* you chose to entertain her apology.\n\nNTA.", "You know her better than us of course.

She was targeting me in front of her friends again. And then she whines when I remove myself from the dynamic entirely. It's not fair for her to get to use that as an excuse because when does it end?
