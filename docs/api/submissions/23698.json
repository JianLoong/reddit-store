Growing up she would always come to me for help with things our parents wanted her to do alone or for money, because I had money young from helping out my best friends grandparents who would always throw us five or ten dollars for doing stuff for them. But my sister was a very popular kid and had a bunch of friends who were popular and I was not. So she never liked being seen with me. When we got older it was worse because she'd ask to borrow money or she'd ask me to drive her home from school but if I dared approach her around her friends she'd get so mad and say it was embarrassing to be seen with me. She and her friends used to make fun of me and my best friend too because he's a guy and they would say we were either secretly dating or he was secretly gay. She'd throw out some wild shit just to fit in. It annoyed the crap out of me because she'd always want something when none of her friends were around. I'd say we weren't at all close in that time despite me giving in normally because I did love her but she was shitty to me and to my friend.\n\nAs adults who are now 26 and 28, I would say our relationship got better eventually and she seemed to improve a lot as a person. She even apologized to me and my best friend for going along and spreading more rumors about us. She even asked me to be her maid of honor which shocked me because I didn't ask her to be mine. I thought we were finally starting to be close as sisters. But she started treating me like shit again. She wanted me to change my hair completely (my hair is pink and all textured), then she wanted me to cover up the two tattoos I have (one of which represents my kids) and told me I looked like a biker and not a bridesmaid. When we went dress shopping she'd always have something negative to say about the dresses they had me try while she was crazy about her friends dresses. After a few months she told me she felt like I would be too distracting on her wedding day and would I mind being a regular guest and not a bridesmaid. Something clicked for me then and I told her not to worry about me being a distraction because not only would I step down as her maid of honor, but I will keep myself away from her wedding and do her the kindness of not being there when she's clearly still embarrassed of me like she was as a kid.\n\nShe freaked out and said she never said she didn't want me there. She told me I'm her sister and I should be there. My parents were SO disappointed when they learned what happened but said they understood my decision and it was probably for the best overall. My sister's fiance accused me of holding the past against her and overreacting to what she wants for her wedding day and I should do better. My sister cried down the phone to me asking why I'm being mean to her.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1690962920, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15g2htg/aita_for_telling_my_sister_that_she_no_longer_has/", "score": 342, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She asked me to step down as maid of honor but she did ask me to be a regular guest. So the decision not to go 100% came from me. It might be an overreaction or me behaving childishly to past hurts and not just what's going on now. I could potentially be wrong for how I have responded to all of this. It does seem to have caused a reaction from her that I was not expecting.

And in my opinion that makes her a giant asshole. She asked you to be her maid of honour, knowing how you look, as in that you have textured pink hair and tattoos, and then insulted you for the way you look. That\u2019s ridiculous and rude. She has closed the door by being selfish and cruel, you are setting a health line that states that you won\u2019t tolerate being treated poorly. \n\nMy suggestion is more tattoos and brighter hair. Be yourself. Be free. And let her apologise to you. Her fianc\u00e9 is in the wrong clearly as well. He needs to open his eyes to your sister\u2019s behaviour and stop defending it. She\u2019s a grown woman, but she is immature.", "NTA. \n\nYour sister is the asshole. \n\nShe never changed. At heart she\u2019s still the popular girl who cares what everyone thinks and wants all the attention for herself.

Fuck that. \n\nIf she wanted YOU in her wedding, she would be fine with you being you at her wedding. She wanted you to be her MoH because that\u2019s part of the fairy tail wedding. She wanted to look close to you for HER big day. This is about her looking how she wants to look and feeling good about herself. She\u2019s not thinking about how she\u2019s treating you at all. She wants control. You not going ruins that. \n\nOf course she wants you there, she just wants all the attention on her. Yours included. If you\u2019re not there then people are going to ask why you\u2019re not there. That\u2019s probably worse in her selfish mind than you having pink hair and tattoos, honestly, because the truth reveals that she\u2019s an asshole. \n\nYou don\u2019t owe her anything just because you both came out of the same uterus. \n\nIf you really want to piss her off post some really nice pictures online on the day of her wedding looking how she wanted you to look on stage, since how you usually are isn\u2019t up to snuff for her.", "NTA.

Not attending is really the best for everyone.", "I would not consider it after everything that has happened. Because I do not believe she would truly mean it. She'd just go right back to the way she was because this is proof that she never really changed.", "Your parents sound great!  So many of these threads involve parents who just let the entitled kid trample all over their sibling(s).  Nice to see a set of parents who realise that one of their kids isn't always that nice.", "Good point", "I hear that a lot. My parents always despaired about her behavior.
