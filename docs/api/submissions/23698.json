Growing up she would always come to me for help with things our parents wanted her to do alone or for money, because I had money young from helping out my best friends grandparents who would always throw us five or ten dollars for doing stuff for them. But my sister was a very popular kid and had a bunch of friends who were popular and I was not. So she never liked being seen with me. When we got older it was worse because she'd ask to borrow money or she'd ask me to drive her home from school but if I dared approach her around her friends she'd get so mad and say it was embarrassing to be seen with me. She and her friends used to make fun of me and my best friend too because he's a guy and they would say we were either secretly dating or he was secretly gay. She'd throw out some wild shit just to fit in. It annoyed the crap out of me because she'd always want something when none of her friends were around. I'd say we weren't at all close in that time despite me giving in normally because I did love her but she was shitty to me and to my friend.\n\nAs adults who are now 26 and 28, I would say our relationship got better eventually and she seemed to improve a lot as a person. She even apologized to me and my best friend for going along and spreading more rumors about us. She even asked me to be her maid of honor which shocked me because I didn't ask her to be mine. I thought we were finally starting to be close as sisters. But she started treating me like shit again. She wanted me to change my hair completely (my hair is pink and all textured), then she wanted me to cover up the two tattoos I have (one of which represents my kids) and told me I looked like a biker and not a bridesmaid. When we went dress shopping she'd always have something negative to say about the dresses they had me try while she was crazy about her friends dresses. After a few months she told me she felt like I would be too distracting on her wedding day and would I mind being a regular guest and not a bridesmaid. Something clicked for me then and I told her not to worry about me being a distraction because not only would I step down as her maid of honor, but I will keep myself away from her wedding and do her the kindness of not being there when she's clearly still embarrassed of me like she was as a kid.\n\nShe freaked out and said she never said she didn't want me there. She told me I'm her sister and I should be there. My parents were SO disappointed when they learned what happened but said they understood my decision and it was probably for the best overall. My sister's fiance accused me of holding the past against her and overreacting to what she wants for her wedding day and I should do better.

She asked me to step down as maid of honor but she did ask me to be a regular guest. So the decision not to go 100% came from me. It might be an overreaction or me behaving childishly to past hurts and not just what's going on now. I could potentially be wrong for how I have responded to all of this.

It's a bit like highschool bullies, they don't \"change\" because they got older they \"change\" because life outside of highschool doesn't exactly indulge bullies so readily nor provide them with willing victims.\n\nYour sister is behaving like this because she was performing in front of her friends, and thus went back to her old ways.", "Out of curiosity, not that it would excuse her behaviour, but are any of the other bridesmaids her high school friends?", "NTA.  If you were truly \"holding the past against her\", you never would have agreed to any of this to begin with.  You took a chance on her having done SOME maturing over the past 15-20 years only to discover that in fact, she was still the same person.  You acted accordingly and let the past INFORM your decision making, but it sure as hell didn't dictate it.  Blood ties alone don't dictate family and you get to choose who you designate as such.  At this point, she doesn't merit the title, and there's no reason to pay her any more mind than an acquaintance.", "NTA", "NTA. She just proved the saying, \"The best predictor of future behavior is past behavior \"\n\nShe has shown you who she is, believe her.", "NTA. I absolutely cannot stand this trend of making people change major aspects of their appearance for a wedding. People should appreciate loved ones for who they are. Those distinct qualities make us special and unique. If she can\u2019t handle it for her photos\u2014if she does not understand that in fact you being yourself actually adds to her day\u2014she doesn\u2019t deserve you there.", "NTA\n\nIt's not the past if she's still doing it", "NTA, she is!!!", "NTA. Not at all. Your story is almost identical to mine regarding my sister. It's spooky uncanny. You know what? My sister never changed who she was. I haven't spoken to her since 1991 (when I was 30), and my life has been greatly better for it (therapy helped).", "NTA! Your parents are awesome. BIL (sister should take notes) by his comment about it being her day; should realize that there's a massive difference between a day (I'll concede a special day), one day, vs sisterhood. She's ruining it, has ruined the bond you both built after her treatment (her insecurities) of you growing up.", "*earning a PSYD here\n\nIt\u2019s good that you stepped down as her bridesmaid. Yes it might feel unfortunate that you set up a hard boundary during an important event, but it has to be done because you need to show her that you can\u2019t bend to her emotional abuse, at all. And this definitely is emotional abuse because she is clearly making you feel like you are not enough as you are.", "NTA. You owe her nothing but please make sure that if you don\u2019t attend, you can let go of any guilt associated with withdrawing. You seem thoughtful and this sort of thing eats away at considerate people.", "> *She told me I'm her sister and I should be there.*\n\nObligation, not friendship, not sharing, obligation. \n\nShe doesn't want you there.", "Nta. I hate people who says stuff like \u2018 holding on to the past\u2019, like hell yeah I\u2019m gonna hold onto the past if the present you is still doing that same shit", "NTA. Throw the whole sister away.", "NTA\n\nI don't think your sister ever changed. She's just better at hiding it now.\n\nThe fiance, probably got a sweetened version of what happened.  So if course calling you out. If he knows exactly what happened, since he knew about the past do possible,  then maybe they deserve each other.\n\nKeep your boundaries and maybe add a few new ones. \n\nDefinitely don't loan her money or babysit in the future. \n\nCall or text extended family you're close to what happened and that's why you won't be attending.  Don't give your sister a  chance to control the dialog and twist thing around. \n\nGlad your parents have your back and understand the past and how today isn't any different. She's still knocking you down and belittling you. \n\nDo something fun that day instead of going to the wedding. On the plus side instead of a wedding gift you can treat yourself.", "NTA, but your sister is. Sorry. \n\nYou replied to some comments saying your parents have always worked hard to turn her into a decent person. That\u2019s one sign that your sister is a piece of work, and more likely to be the AH. Not that you need it.\n\nShe asked you to step down from the wedding party \u201ca few months in.\u201d MOH has a lot of responsibilities, and I suspect you took care of a good deal of things in those few months, and she had her little change of heart once she got all the work out of you that she wanted.", "NTA but your sister's actions speak louder than words moving you from a position, making sidebar comments on your hair, tattoos, and how the dresses looked on you because she has this imaginary vision of the perfect wedding.  She and her SO are extremely shallow if they have issues with your looks.  So yes, she is overreacting and you won't be going because you don't need to be treated like garbage by her or anyone else at her wedding.", "That is so it!", "NTA.", "NTA.\n\nPlease stay away from that mean sister of yours.", "NTA  \nYou decided you didn't want to go.  \nNothing AH about that.", "NtA. She only wants you there for the perfect family picture as a happy family.", "Yo, fuck your sister.  She\u2019s sucks ass.  NTA", "NTA, but I love your parents. Give them a hug for me will you?", "I realized that growing old means that you've managed to not die. I figured this out when my father's mother treated me like piece of poo she'd gotten on her shoe because she hated my mother.  My grandma, my mother's mother, was mentally ill, but still just an awesome person.  I like to think that I only had one grandma.", "Or she is/was the ringleader of he friend group and started/continued all the shit in the first place"]}
