Even though it\u2019s early days I really thought he was the one. He is nice, attentive, funny and attractive and I\u2019m getting older and I thought he must be the one I have kids with and settle down with. But he doesn\u2019t drive which is very strange in my city. The public transportation is really bad and most people would opt for a car over an apartment because at least they would be able to get around. Only people who work from home or were in poverty wouldn\u2019t have a car and he makes good money and works 15 min away from where he lives by car so it made no sense. \n\nHe shows up at dates by asking his friends for rides or asking me to pick him up. We live close by so I didn\u2019t mind. But I asked him about it and he said cars are expensive and he didn\u2019t want to pay for one. But then he has trouble getting around and complains about how expensive Ubers are. \n\nOne day I found out my states has a website of public crimes and decided to put in his name. A wall of offences came up and it matched his first, middle and last names as well as his year of birth. He has 5 duis and has a court date for a pending one in a week.  \n\nThe duis range in date from 10 years ago to one he got 6 months ago. That\u2019s the one he is set to go to court for. Because his name isn\u2019t super uncommon I decided to see if he takes the day off work because it\u2019s in the morning. He does take that day off and says he has a doctor\u2019s appointment.\n\nI confront him when I came over that evening and he got angry at me for not trusting him and infiltrating his personal life like this. I pissed he lied to me and he says he doesn\u2019t have to tell me everything and he\u2019s changed. I told him his last dui was 6 months ago so how has he changed? He got mad and said the cops were pining things on him and he just had alcohol with him and he didn\u2019t actually drink. I could believe that for 1 dui but he has 5. I asked him to show me proof and he said he doesn\u2019t have to and if I was a good gf I would just trust him.

It could have been a lot worse than a DUI with no casualties. He wasn't honest about it and got angry when you found out- might wanna reevaluate if this is the guy for you.", "NTA. Commiting crimes that put other people's lives at risk isn't your \"personal life\" just dump him now. Dude can't even take responsibility for something he's been arrested for 5 times", "NTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t run a background check, you checked public records. \n\nRun the fuck away. Text him dumping him right now. He\u2019s an alcoholic liar with continued criminal thinking.", "NTA.\n\nHis response only confirms that.", "NTA seems like you've had a narrow escape.

Not to mention, he would've at least taken ownership of his problem and not tried \"the cops are trying to pin stuff on me\".\n\nBe thankful you found this out early on.", "If you live in a state like mine, then most court information is public information held on a public website. He got angry at you going into his personal life, but that information is not private - anyone can see it.\n\nWith 5 past DUIs and one pending I doubt that he has learned his lesson. You are NTA for looking him up on a court database. I looked up pretty much everyone I went to high school with on mine for fun and would definitely do it for someone in a more intimate relationship. If it was a paid background check service I might feel differently but it is still imaginable in a marriage situation.", "NTA Your bf is an alcoholic, a criminal and a liar. You obviously had a gut feeling something was wrong and checked a public record. Now that you know the truth I hope you will dump this AH. You deserve a lot better!", "NTA - 3 months in and he\u2019s lying about it with the whole Drs appointment excuse.", "NTA. His behaviour was not normal for your area. His explanation does not make sense so it is normal to suspect something not right. No one really fully trust someone when a yellow flag is being waved.", "NTA- first of all, you did not do a background check on him, you looked up public records . It's not like you paid someone to dig through his past, you just Googled his name on a certain website. \n\nSecond, he got mad at you because you didn't trust him and because you didn't trust him you found out that he was lying to you.\n\nIf he can't live up to his past and admit to his faults, this is not a long-term relationship.\n\nIt would be interesting to know, does he still get really drunk when he's with you?", "NTA.

I've change! \nNTA", "NTA - Look, it would be one thing if he didn't want to advertise to a new relationship that he had these DUI's hanging over him. Plenty of otherwise-decent folks may have things in their history that they aren't proud of,. But he really needed to own up to it when you started asking, and it's totally unsurprising that you would have looked into his background when you've only known him for a few months.\n\nHe had the opportunity to come clean when you came to him with what you found, but he instead chose to become accusatory towards you, and couldn't accept responsibility for his own actions to boot.\n\nYou mention that you are \"getting older\" - not sure what that means for you, but assuming that BF is also in your age range, I feel like it's safe to say that the guy has missed a lot of opportunities to grow up along the way, and doesn't seem like he's planning to grow up any time soon. \n\nYou didn't ask about this, but I'll answer like you did - yes, you should probably dump the guy; not for the background so much as for the way he's handling the revelation. You can do better.", "NTA I hope you meant ex-bf.", "NTA\n\nThe fact that he tried to hide it a mayor red flag. 5 duis means immature and overall stupid to me.", "NTA more people should do this, hasn't anyone watched law and order svu", "NTA.

That information is public & you felt something was off so you looked it up & he had a poor reaction to you finding out. Something else to consider: An average drunk driver has driven drunk over 80 times before first arrest. Sounds like this man has some red flags he\u2019s been trying to hide from you & now that you\u2019ve uncovered some he\u2019s trying to blame you instead of owning up to what he\u2019s done.", "Honestly NTA\n\nYou were right that he was being dishonest in some way and while personal and serious, it does not sound like he has learned his lesson in any way at all. \n\nEither he thinks it's not a big deal or he has a drinking problem he is not facing.", "NTA - it's call public information for a reason.  \n\nIn other topics.... RESPONSIBILITY!!!!  \n\nHe is essentially getting busted for driving under the influence.  Not once.  Multiple times.  \n\nSo many questions come to mind.  The biggest:\n1. Is this the person I want to have children with? \n\nHe clearly does not care and has a problem with substance abuse and responsible decision making.  Does not know his limits.  And will break the law for his own convenience.  Brings up the other big question: \n2. How likely is this partner to act in good faith to our relationship.  \n\nThe worst part is he feels you violated his privacy.  Its public information.  His ability to have a conversation about what is publicly available draws to question what other secrets he will keep. \n3. Am I really able to trust them?\n\nThe fact that this is all a surprise to you also calls into question:\n4. Are they being themselves with you?", "NTA. Your intuition was right. And he has no right telling you it's wrong not to trust him, when he has been lying to you about this for the entire time you've known him.", "NTA. This guy is wrong on so many levels. You were right to trust your intuitions.", "NTA in this situation.", "He isn't angry that you did the background check. He is angry because you know his secrets now. NTA.", "NTA, you have every right to know who you are dating, he should\u2019ve been truthful about his reasoning for not driving in the first place. I\u2019ve had my issues in the past and was always up front about it with people I was dating. Definitely NTA and he should definitely be your ex after this.", "6 DUI\u2019s? Run from this guy. He clearly values his own personal comfort over other people\u2019s lives. There\u2019s people in prison for 20 years for 5 dui\u2019s, he must be extremely lucky.", "NTA.  In new relationships a person needs to know if a partner can be trusted.  Perhaps this doesn't apply ... Ted Bundy's wife loved him and thought he was a great husband.  Further, all of his victims voluntarily went with him to their deaths.  The point is that people are in real danger, maybe not life threatening, but real at the beginning of relationships.  Truth is always important, but at the beginning it is more so.  If suspicions are aroused, a background check is certainly an option.  In this case, ending the relationship is probably the best choice because he is making excuses ... not apologizing for the lies.  My thoughts.  Your choice.", "NTA, can you tell me how much it costs and what service you used? Kinda wanna do one on myself.", "Does he still drink? He wants you to trust him, but he lied about why he didn\u2019t have a car. NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou were curious and concerned over very valid red flags.  You checked a PUBLIC listing which would only really if he had any criminal offenses in his past, something that is absolutely within your rights.  You've only been dating 3 months, and it's understandable to be concerned. \n\nThe next steps are going to be very important.  The fact that he hid the DUIs isn't necessarily a bad thing.  Again, this is a new relationship, and a person isn't going to tell you from the beginning: \"Hi!  I like you!  But I may have some legal issues that I have to deal with in the near future\".  But now that the word is out, how he reacts is going to be very important to watch.  Getting upset initially is understandable on his end, but if he blows it up any more than that, then you need to start calling him your EX boyfriend.", "NTA and you findings proved your instincts correct. Always trust yourself and your gut feelings. This is a very big lie to overcome. Especially, only three months into a relationship.", "NTA\n\nHe makes bad decisions and doesn\u2019t learn from mistakes.", "NTA it's imperative to know what you're getting yourself into. I was a single mom, and before I started dating my now husband I ran background checks on him and any other guy I started talking to. As a woman and mother you have to be vigilant in safety. What would have happened if it was domestic violence and he ended up beating you in the future? Definitely  NTA", "NTA.  \n\\> my states has a website of public crimes  \nIt is not much of a hidden background check if your state has a list of public crimes.\n\nIt seems like he got mad that you found out this \"secret\" and it seems like that he didn't trust you that you would understand this.\n\n\\> My bf and I have been dating for 3 months.

For ages. About something that matters. NTA and I hope you booted him.", "NTA \n\nYou have every right to look up any offences he has made.\n\nHis reaction is also very poor, if he\u2019s not told you this and he hasn\u2019t been honest upfront then it makes me wonder what else he won\u2019t/wouldn\u2019t tell you.", "NTA, you had a gut feeling something was off and followed it only to be proved right. i don\u2019t think what you did is much different to googling a family member out of boredom.", "NTA. You have a right to know when you\u2019re considering changing your entire life\u2019s trajectory for a person. Also as much as it may hurt, I think you need to let this guy go.

I married a man who had nine DUIs. He got his license back after ten years clean. \nMajor addiction red flags there.\nHe wasn\u2019t honest with you, he has some work to do.", "NTA, and imo a background check on anyone with whom you might consider having a romantic, sexual, and/or cohabitating relationship is utterly and completely reasonable. I'd be disappointed if my wife hadn't at least Googled my name in our early days.\n\nNext step: find a new boyfriend.", "NTA, not being open and honest with you about his fuck ups is a massive red flag, my boyfriend's criminal record is long enough to be a small novel but from day 1 he has been 100% upfront and honest about it, anyone that would hide that stuff from the person they are seeing isn\u2019t trustworthy and isn\u2019t about to change their behaviour.", "NTA\n\nBF is using the old---the best defense is a good offense technique.  Turning it around to make you feel like you have done something wrong when it was in fact him.  Trust is earned.  It is not, and should not be the default in a relationship.  Especially when he is the one who has lied by omission.\n\nYou should think seriously about continuing a relationship with someone who clearly has an serious issue with alcohol and does not yet seem willing to take responsibility for it.  \n\nWhen we started dating my husband told me that he had a DUI a number of years before.  He shared the information with me himself.  We talked about it.  It has not happened again.", "NTA\nYou had some gut feeling, followed it and were right. He lied to you too. So you also have reasons to be mad.", "NTA. Its public information - you didnt get the info by deception, or reading his private communications  and you only checked when things didnt add up. The info is there for a reason. and people should expect that people look them up before dating them, hiring them etc.\n\nI dont get his argument that you didnt trust him. He is a serial liar. And there is no way you should think of marrying and having kids with someone so irresponsible that 5 times they get drunk behind the wheel. He could have killed  people each time, kids, innocent people. And lol at it being pinned on him - you can only go to court for a DUI if there is a breathalyser test, they then do a blood test.\n\nActually next time check someone for priors before you start dating them.", "NTA But please consider dumping this manipulative clown \ud83d\udea9", "NTA \n\nGlazing over this whole story, idk if all states are like this but mine this stuff is all public record.

You can't know someone well enough to know if they are the one and if they really are good people, if you have been together for only 3 months. A lot of people tend to pretend that they are better people than they actually are and/or they pretend and lie about who they are in general. Around the 3 month mark of a relationship is where that facade tends to start falling apart because they can no longer keep that up. I have had several relationships with men in the past that fell apart just after 3 months together because their facade had fallen down and I could finally see who they really were. They had tried to hide their bad habits and bad qualities of their personalities and they had pretended to be someone better, someone that appealed to me. After I saw them for who they reallt were, I knew I deserved better and broke up with them. That is how I learned that people may hide who they really are for a while. It often comes apparent around the 3 month mark or even earlier. Sometimes they can hide it for up to 6 months or longer.\n\nSo what I want ti say is: don't give up on love and romance but also be careful and keep an eye open for anything suspicious. And don't move too fast in a relationship and get too serieus too soon (like moving in together, getting engaged or getting married within a year of being together). \n\nSome people get lucky, know they have found the one instantly and get married within a few months and enjoy a happy long life together. But many others think and feel they have found the one only to find out a little while later they were conned and they were now in a shitty situation.\n\nYou are not in control of others and what they do. You are only in control of yourself. You can be good and honest and someone that is worthy of being trusted because you show the real you and don't hide anything.\n\n\n\nAlso please dump that AH if a boyfriend you have.

It would be one thing if his driving had just never come up.

Him saying that you were untrusting and that it's inherently wrong that you know this information, is him trying to paint you as a villain for finding out that he's been lying to you. He's been saying that the bar, the test, is you need to blindly trust him and you're an asshole if you don't.\n\nWhat you need to do is just dump this guy from your life. There is no way forward with someone who is saying that you are not his equal, he is allowed to lie to you and you're not allowed to question him. Can you see a pathway forward that doesn't preclude just ignoring that he has already lied to you, and never questioning him about what else is going on in his life?

He's not your guy.", "NTA.  He had a chance to tell you when you asked him and he didn't.

Even if it\u2019s true that the most recent DUI was from \u201conly\u201d having alcohol with him, he was clearly breaching some law, whether it was within his reach while driving, or I\u2019m guessing breaching terms of probation that forbid him from having alcohol in his vehicle at all. Going back 10 years sounds like he\u2019s an alcoholic and is not ready to admit it or change. Cut your losses and ditch this guy.", "NTA always check out the person you're dating.

What you did was a little more than a google search. It was all a matter of public record that literally ANYONE could find out. Everyone should be doing this with a new person in their life. I\u2019ve had a background check for employment purposes and they found out pretty much everything aside from my blood type and medical history. I also had to give written consent for that background check. \n\nI hate to say this, but your boyfriend is an alcoholic. 6 months is NOT enough time for him to honestly be able to say he has changed. Alcoholics are more likely to relapse in the first year of sobriety IF he is even trying to stay sober. \n\nYour boyfriend most likely isn\u2019t driving because he legally cannot drive due to license suspension or revocation. (That means he can\u2019t buy a car and insure it and register it.) In my state 2 DUIs in five years gets your licenses suspended, possible jail time, a required MADD class, a required interlock device (if the judge allows the person to drive to work), possibly required rehab, fines, and a ton of fees to actually get your license back after the suspension is lifted. Any more than that and you\u2019re going to jail for a while plus potential license revocation when you get out. \n\nIf you stay with him you will end up being associated with his actions. Your name will end up in one of his court documents for one reason or another. Those court documents will show up in a REAL background check if you ever have to get one done. As some one who spent five years with an alcoholic I can about promise you that. When I say this it really is for your own good. Cut your losses. Three month is a very short time frame, he is already lying to you and trying to gaslight you. That is what alcoholics and addicts do. FUCKING RUN FROM HIM.

If we hear different explanations as to why they don't drive, that becomes a bit suspicious.  I'm willing to bet OP's subconscious detected something amiss, like dude's stories didn't seem to add up.\n\nWhen someone seems to be lying about something they would have no reason to lie about(does it matter why you don't own a car?), it triggers further suspicion, and eventually, people get the idea that there's Something Going On.\n\nIt's not just \"being weird.\"  Heck, I'm pretty weird myself.  It's when the weird behavior indicates that something might not be all that it seems, that folks start getting suspicious.", "Ok, but I don't see how his reasoning is inconsistent.

He hasn't earned your trust or your loyalty and instead of coming clean, he turned your very solid survival instincts against you and made you doubt yourself.

One is malicious, one means they're ashamed.", "NTA. What was he going to say when they put him in jail after sentencing and he just ghosted you until he was able to call you from the jail? Dump him.

I can't even argue they were good at drunk driving- mom almost got us killed that one time.  Dad used to drink beer our of a cooler that he kept next to him while driving - which I did not realize was unusual or weird at all until I was a teenager and a friend of mine flipped out about it.

I went to bed after his funeral wishing I'd wake up to find the previous week had been a nightmare and I could see him on Tuesday and make fun of him being a \"mamil\". The sot who'd hit his bicycle had an open can of beer in his truck cab, an open case next to him, and was already well over the limit - at midday. He hit the bike so hard, M (and the bike) flipped over the cab, and landed in the bed of the truck. The drunk kept going. With M in the bed. A cop noticed M and the bike when the truck drove past - the guy was so oblivious, he was going home.\n\nDriver never should have been on the road. He'd had NINE previous DUIs.

But I don't think driving is an addiction, why can't they just take a taxi?", "That's insane. I wish that the cops would start testing people's blood alcohol level after concerts. My best friend and I have been to several in the past 3 years & one thing I've noticed is that a lot of people start drinking as soon as they get in, don't stop until they leave & then get behind the wheel & drive home.

I asked my manager \"why not just order the bottle? It's cheaper.\" My manager said it was because a lot of alcoholics dilude themselves into thinking they don't have a problem by buying in smaller quantities.  (Or buying the large quantity at the lower price and drinking it all draws more attention to how much you're actually consuming.)\n\nSame thing with people buying individual shots or fifths in liquor stores every single day.\n\nAnyway, my point is that they aren't going to the bar thinking \"I'm gonna get shit faced and drive home\".  They're thinking \"I'll stop by the bar for one beer on my way home.
