Even though it\u2019s early days I really thought he was the one. He is nice, attentive, funny and attractive and I\u2019m getting older and I thought he must be the one I have kids with and settle down with. But he doesn\u2019t drive which is very strange in my city. The public transportation is really bad and most people would opt for a car over an apartment because at least they would be able to get around. Only people who work from home or were in poverty wouldn\u2019t have a car and he makes good money and works 15 min away from where he lives by car so it made no sense. \n\nHe shows up at dates by asking his friends for rides or asking me to pick him up. We live close by so I didn\u2019t mind. But I asked him about it and he said cars are expensive and he didn\u2019t want to pay for one. But then he has trouble getting around and complains about how expensive Ubers are. \n\nOne day I found out my states has a website of public crimes and decided to put in his name. A wall of offences came up and it matched his first, middle and last names as well as his year of birth. He has 5 duis and has a court date for a pending one in a week.  \n\nThe duis range in date from 10 years ago to one he got 6 months ago. That\u2019s the one he is set to go to court for. Because his name isn\u2019t super uncommon I decided to see if he takes the day off work because it\u2019s in the morning. He does take that day off and says he has a doctor\u2019s appointment.\n\nI confront him when I came over that evening and he got angry at me for not trusting him and infiltrating his personal life like this. I pissed he lied to me and he says he doesn\u2019t have to tell me everything and he\u2019s changed. I told him his last dui was 6 months ago so how has he changed? He got mad and said the cops were pining things on him and he just had alcohol with him and he didn\u2019t actually drink. I could believe that for 1 dui but he has 5. I asked him to show me proof and he said he doesn\u2019t have to and if I was a good gf I would just trust him.

It could have been a lot worse than a DUI with no casualties. He wasn't honest about it and got angry when you found out- might wanna reevaluate if this is the guy for you.", "NTA. Commiting crimes that put other people's lives at risk isn't your \"personal life\" just dump him now. Dude can't even take responsibility for something he's been arrested for 5 times", "NTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t run a background check, you checked public records. \n\nRun the fuck away. Text him dumping him right now. He\u2019s an alcoholic liar with continued criminal thinking.", "NTA.\n\nHis response only confirms that.", "NTA seems like you've had a narrow escape.

Not to mention, he would've at least taken ownership of his problem and not tried \"the cops are trying to pin stuff on me\".\n\nBe thankful you found this out early on.", "If you live in a state like mine, then most court information is public information held on a public website. He got angry at you going into his personal life, but that information is not private - anyone can see it.\n\nWith 5 past DUIs and one pending I doubt that he has learned his lesson. You are NTA for looking him up on a court database. I looked up pretty much everyone I went to high school with on mine for fun and would definitely do it for someone in a more intimate relationship. If it was a paid background check service I might feel differently but it is still imaginable in a marriage situation.", "NTA Your bf is an alcoholic, a criminal and a liar. You obviously had a gut feeling something was wrong and checked a public record. Now that you know the truth I hope you will dump this AH. You deserve a lot better!", "NTA - 3 months in and he\u2019s lying about it with the whole Drs appointment excuse.", "NTA. His behaviour was not normal for your area. His explanation does not make sense so it is normal to suspect something not right. No one really fully trust someone when a yellow flag is being waved.", "NTA- first of all, you did not do a background check on him, you looked up public records . It's not like you paid someone to dig through his past, you just Googled his name on a certain website. \n\nSecond, he got mad at you because you didn't trust him and because you didn't trust him you found out that he was lying to you.\n\nIf he can't live up to his past and admit to his faults, this is not a long-term relationship.\n\nIt would be interesting to know, does he still get really drunk when he's with you?", "NTA.

I've change! \nNTA", "NTA - Look, it would be one thing if he didn't want to advertise to a new relationship that he had these DUI's hanging over him. Plenty of otherwise-decent folks may have things in their history that they aren't proud of,. But he really needed to own up to it when you started asking, and it's totally unsurprising that you would have looked into his background when you've only known him for a few months.\n\nHe had the opportunity to come clean when you came to him with what you found, but he instead chose to become accusatory towards you, and couldn't accept responsibility for his own actions to boot.\n\nYou mention that you are \"getting older\" - not sure what that means for you, but assuming that BF is also in your age range, I feel like it's safe to say that the guy has missed a lot of opportunities to grow up along the way, and doesn't seem like he's planning to grow up any time soon. \n\nYou didn't ask about this, but I'll answer like you did - yes, you should probably dump the guy; not for the background so much as for the way he's handling the revelation. You can do better.", "NTA I hope you meant ex-bf.", "NTA\n\nThe fact that he tried to hide it a mayor red flag. 5 duis means immature and overall stupid to me.", "NTA more people should do this, hasn't anyone watched law and order svu", "NTA.

That information is public & you felt something was off so you looked it up & he had a poor reaction to you finding out. Something else to consider: An average drunk driver has driven drunk over 80 times before first arrest. Sounds like this man has some red flags he\u2019s been trying to hide from you & now that you\u2019ve uncovered some he\u2019s trying to blame you instead of owning up to what he\u2019s done.", "Honestly NTA\n\nYou were right that he was being dishonest in some way and while personal and serious, it does not sound like he has learned his lesson in any way at all. \n\nEither he thinks it's not a big deal or he has a drinking problem he is not facing.", "NTA - it's call public information for a reason.  \n\nIn other topics.... RESPONSIBILITY!!!!  \n\nHe is essentially getting busted for driving under the influence.  Not once.  Multiple times.  \n\nSo many questions come to mind.  The biggest:\n1. Is this the person I want to have children with? \n\nHe clearly does not care and has a problem with substance abuse and responsible decision making.  Does not know his limits.  And will break the law for his own convenience.  Brings up the other big question: \n2. How likely is this partner to act in good faith to our relationship.  \n\nThe worst part is he feels you violated his privacy.  Its public information.  His ability to have a conversation about what is publicly available draws to question what other secrets he will keep. \n3. Am I really able to trust them?\n\nThe fact that this is all a surprise to you also calls into question:\n4. Are they being themselves with you?", "NTA. Your intuition was right. And he has no right telling you it's wrong not to trust him, when he has been lying to you about this for the entire time you've known him.", "NTA. This guy is wrong on so many levels. You were right to trust your intuitions.", "NTA in this situation.", "He isn't angry that you did the background check. He is angry because you know his secrets now. NTA.", "NTA, you have every right to know who you are dating, he should\u2019ve been truthful about his reasoning for not driving in the first place. I\u2019ve had my issues in the past and was always up front about it with people I was dating. Definitely NTA and he should definitely be your ex after this.", "6 DUI\u2019s? Run from this guy. He clearly values his own personal comfort over other people\u2019s lives. There\u2019s people in prison for 20 years for 5 dui\u2019s, he must be extremely lucky.", "NTA.  In new relationships a person needs to know if a partner can be trusted.  Perhaps this doesn't apply ... Ted Bundy's wife loved him and thought he was a great husband.  Further, all of his victims voluntarily went with him to their deaths.  The point is that people are in real danger, maybe not life threatening, but real at the beginning of relationships.  Truth is always important, but at the beginning it is more so.  If suspicions are aroused, a background check is certainly an option.  In this case, ending the relationship is probably the best choice because he is making excuses ... not apologizing for the lies.  My thoughts.  Your choice.", "NTA, can you tell me how much it costs and what service you used? Kinda wanna do one on myself.", "Does he still drink? He wants you to trust him, but he lied about why he didn\u2019t have a car. NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou were curious and concerned over very valid red flags.  You checked a PUBLIC listing which would only really if he had any criminal offenses in his past, something that is absolutely within your rights.  You've only been dating 3 months, and it's understandable to be concerned. \n\nThe next steps are going to be very important.  The fact that he hid the DUIs isn't necessarily a bad thing.  Again, this is a new relationship, and a person isn't going to tell you from the beginning: \"Hi!  I like you!  But I may have some legal issues that I have to deal with in the near future\".  But now that the word is out, how he reacts is going to be very important to watch.  Getting upset initially is understandable on his end, but if he blows it up any more than that, then you need to start calling him your EX boyfriend.", "NTA and you findings proved your instincts correct. Always trust yourself and your gut feelings. This is a very big lie to overcome. Especially, only three months into a relationship.", "NTA\n\nHe makes bad decisions and doesn\u2019t learn from mistakes.", "NTA it's imperative to know what you're getting yourself into. I was a single mom, and before I started dating my now husband I ran background checks on him and any other guy I started talking to. As a woman and mother you have to be vigilant in safety. What would have happened if it was domestic violence and he ended up beating you in the future? Definitely  NTA", "NTA.  \n\\> my states has a website of public crimes  \nIt is not much of a hidden background check if your state has a list of public crimes.\n\nIt seems like he got mad that you found out this \"secret\" and it seems like that he didn't trust you that you would understand this.\n\n\\> My bf and I have been dating for 3 months.

For ages. About something that matters. NTA and I hope you booted him.", "NTA \n\nYou have every right to look up any offences he has made.\n\nHis reaction is also very poor, if he\u2019s not told you this and he hasn\u2019t been honest upfront then it makes me wonder what else he won\u2019t/wouldn\u2019t tell you.", "NTA, you had a gut feeling something was off and followed it only to be proved right. i don\u2019t think what you did is much different to googling a family member out of boredom.", "NTA. You have a right to know when you\u2019re considering changing your entire life\u2019s trajectory for a person. Also as much as it may hurt, I think you need to let this guy go. He sounds like he\u2019s all talk and never actually changes his behavior.

I married a man who had nine DUIs. He got his license back after ten years clean. \nMajor addiction red flags there.\nHe wasn\u2019t honest with you, he has some work to do.", "NTA, and imo a background check on anyone with whom you might consider having a romantic, sexual, and/or cohabitating relationship is utterly and completely reasonable. I'd be disappointed if my wife hadn't at least Googled my name in our early days.\n\nNext step: find a new boyfriend.", "NTA, not being open and honest with you about his fuck ups is a massive red flag, my boyfriend's criminal record is long enough to be a small novel but from day 1 he has been 100% upfront and honest about it, anyone that would hide that stuff from the person they are seeing isn\u2019t trustworthy and isn\u2019t about to change their behaviour.", "NTA\n\nBF is using the old---the best defense is a good offense technique.  Turning it around to make you feel like you have done something wrong when it was in fact him.  Trust is earned.  It is not, and should not be the default in a relationship.  Especially when he is the one who has lied by omission.\n\nYou should think seriously about continuing a relationship with someone who clearly has an serious issue with alcohol and does not yet seem willing to take responsibility for it.  \n\nWhen we started dating my husband told me that he had a DUI a number of years before.  He shared the information with me himself.  We talked about it.  It has not happened again.", "NTA\nYou had some gut feeling, followed it and were right. He lied to you too. So you also have reasons to be mad.", "NTA. Its public information - you didnt get the info by deception, or reading his private communications  and you only checked when things didnt add up. The info is there for a reason. and people should expect that people look them up before dating them, hiring them etc.\n\nI dont get his argument that you didnt trust him. He is a serial liar. And there is no way you should think of marrying and having kids with someone so irresponsible that 5 times they get drunk behind the wheel. He could have killed  people each time, kids, innocent people. And lol at it being pinned on him - you can only go to court for a DUI if there is a breathalyser test, they then do a blood test.\n\nActually next time check someone for priors before you start dating them.", "NTA But please consider dumping this manipulative clown \ud83d\udea9", "NTA \n\nGlazing over this whole story, idk if all states are like this but mine this stuff is all public record.

It\u2019s just not. 5 DUIs is a big-fat-fucking-deal and *absolutely* indicates that he is a habitual offender with extremely poor judgement. I\u2019d bet that at least two of those DUIs have a gap of at least 6 months between them, and that *clearly* didn\u2019t indicate he changed, did it?", "6 months isn\u2019t enough time for a dude with 5 DUIIs to change.\n\nThat\u2019s a lifelong battle in treatment. It should be 5-10 years before you even begin to think he changed", "Yeah I also thought it was a tough one, until I read OPs statement again and realized she only did the public search cause she followed her instincts, knowing something was wrong or didn\u2019t add up. If she had no reason, I\u2019d say TA. But in this case, I think she was just smart.", "I\u2019m not sure what you mean by taking the day off to confirm? She didn\u2019t take the day off, she found out that he took the day off", "She suspects he is hiding something. He lies about it. She looks it up and finds out he is lying.\n\nShe is not TA. He lied multiple times. He isn't mad she ran a background check, he is mad she found out.", "OP certainly doesn\u2019t.", "How? BF gave her a wall of red flag behavior, then she checked and he had a wall of criminal offenses - serious ones, at that, which at the *absolute bare minimum* demonstrates that he has extremely poor judgement, and could totally be indicative of an alcohol problem\u2026 the fact that he hid all of this and lied, repeatedly, then attacked OP when she found the truth? Hell-to-the-no OP is NTA", "How is looking up PUBLIC RECORDS snooping?  She already asked him why he didn't drive, and his answer was insufficient for OP.  Turns out OP had a valid reason to be concerned.  He's been caught drunk driving 5 times.  Imagine how many times he drove while plastered, and DIDN'T get caught!", "There's a great bit from comedian Kyle Kinnane where he discusses his DUI - he makes a flippant joke about if you added together all the times he drove drunk or buzzed plus the costs of the DUI, it averages out about right. It gave me pause- because he was totally right. The people I know with DUIs (not many, because I tend to cut selfish people out of my life and there's nothing more selfish than driving loaded) drove drunk **all the time** before they got caught.", "Ummm NTA but close if you choose to stay with this guy who is literally waving the reddist flag ever two inches in front of your face SMH", "Gotcha, thank you OP!", "Right? \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask the liar if he\u2019s lying?\u201d lol", "ESH. They both suck. She could've handled it differently, as she clearly didn't trust him and he should have told her.  \n\nIt's hard for people in recovery to open up for reasons just like this.", "They do. I know, not trusting your partner, and snooping after them has become kind of a thing of late, but it still is sucky behaviour.", "Exactly. If there's nothing to hide, there's no reason to lie.", "I disagree that not driving constitutes a \"wall of red flag behavior.\"", "Not driving isn't a red flag behavior.\n\nNeither is someone who is morbidly curious and enters there SO name into it.  I am willing to bet the half of my lung that is non-functional that the OP searched there name too.\n\nAs for ESH analysis.  Its public information and sooner or later, the truth had to come out.  \n\nThe OP wasn't even planning on breaking up with them.  The SO went above and beyond to prove he couldn't be trusted.  \n\nYeah, it's embarrassing to admit to.  I get the SO not wanting to confess there sins.  But OP was right there begging for a reason to stay and believe in him.  \n\nNow people who do background checks before the first date and try to bring up past events before you get a chance to meet someone.  Those are AHs.", "It\u2019s a new relationship. \n\nTyping new boyfriends name through public records should be standard. \n\nI would like to know if my new partner had DV crimes on their record. Wouldn\u2019t you? So I can bail early.", "Maybe not a wall. But it\u2019s still red flag behavior if he clearly has no reliable means of transportation to the degree that OP has asked about it, and he\u2019s given various excuses.", "Call me old fashioned, but I chose to trust my partners.", "I still don't see that as a red flag, because his excuse, cars are expensive, is true. That is a perfectly valid explanation for why he doesn't have a Car, IMO.", "In an old-fashioned world, you would have likely grown up around your partner in the same small community and knew them socially. So you\u2019d know their legal and substance issues\n\nThe year isn\u2019t 1776 and most of us aren\u2019t living in towns of 500 to 1k\n\nAnd partner is a strong term for a guy you\u2019ve been casually dating for 3 months", "If you live in an area that does not have public transport, which constitutes enormous swaths of the US, it\u2019s pretty dumb to not have a car. You can buy a shitbox for like $800", "They live in a city. Admittedly not one with good public transportation, but I still don't really think him not having a car is questionable. \n\nAlso, while it's easy to just say \"oh, it's only $800\" for this shitbox car, we don't know anything else about his situation. There are many many people out there that would be completely unable to afford an $800 expense - to say nothing about how a shitbox car that only costs $800 will very likely end up costing him a lot more due to how shitty it is.\n\nAnd while I agree that it's dumb for someone in that situation to not have a car, that doesn't mean he's an asshole for it, nor does it mean that not having a car is a red flag."]}
