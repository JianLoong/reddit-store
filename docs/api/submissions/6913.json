Even though it\u2019s early days I really thought he was the one. He is nice, attentive, funny and attractive and I\u2019m getting older and I thought he must be the one I have kids with and settle down with. But he doesn\u2019t drive which is very strange in my city. The public transportation is really bad and most people would opt for a car over an apartment because at least they would be able to get around. Only people who work from home or were in poverty wouldn\u2019t have a car and he makes good money and works 15 min away from where he lives by car so it made no sense. \n\nHe shows up at dates by asking his friends for rides or asking me to pick him up. We live close by so I didn\u2019t mind. But I asked him about it and he said cars are expensive and he didn\u2019t want to pay for one. But then he has trouble getting around and complains about how expensive Ubers are. \n\nOne day I found out my states has a website of public crimes and decided to put in his name. A wall of offences came up and it matched his first, middle and last names as well as his year of birth. He has 5 duis and has a court date for a pending one in a week.  \n\nThe duis range in date from 10 years ago to one he got 6 months ago. That\u2019s the one he is set to go to court for. Because his name isn\u2019t super uncommon I decided to see if he takes the day off work because it\u2019s in the morning. He does take that day off and says he has a doctor\u2019s appointment.\n\nI confront him when I came over that evening and he got angry at me for not trusting him and infiltrating his personal life like this. I pissed he lied to me and he says he doesn\u2019t have to tell me everything and he\u2019s changed. I told him his last dui was 6 months ago so how has he changed? He got mad and said the cops were pining things on him and he just had alcohol with him and he didn\u2019t actually drink. I could believe that for 1 dui but he has 5. I asked him to show me proof and he said he doesn\u2019t have to and if I was a good gf I would just trust him.

It could have been a lot worse than a DUI with no casualties. He wasn't honest about it and got angry when you found out- might wanna reevaluate if this is the guy for you.", "NTA. Commiting crimes that put other people's lives at risk isn't your \"personal life\" just dump him now. Dude can't even take responsibility for something he's been arrested for 5 times", "NTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t run a background check, you checked public records. \n\nRun the fuck away. Text him dumping him right now. He\u2019s an alcoholic liar with continued criminal thinking.", "NTA.\n\nHis response only confirms that.", "NTA seems like you've had a narrow escape.

Not to mention, he would've at least taken ownership of his problem and not tried \"the cops are trying to pin stuff on me\".\n\nBe thankful you found this out early on.", "If you live in a state like mine, then most court information is public information held on a public website. He got angry at you going into his personal life, but that information is not private - anyone can see it.\n\nWith 5 past DUIs and one pending I doubt that he has learned his lesson. You are NTA for looking him up on a court database. I looked up pretty much everyone I went to high school with on mine for fun and would definitely do it for someone in a more intimate relationship. If it was a paid background check service I might feel differently but it is still imaginable in a marriage situation.", "NTA Your bf is an alcoholic, a criminal and a liar. You obviously had a gut feeling something was wrong and checked a public record. Now that you know the truth I hope you will dump this AH. You deserve a lot better!", "NTA - 3 months in and he\u2019s lying about it with the whole Drs appointment excuse.", "NTA. His behaviour was not normal for your area. His explanation does not make sense so it is normal to suspect something not right. No one really fully trust someone when a yellow flag is being waved.", "NTA- first of all, you did not do a background check on him, you looked up public records . It's not like you paid someone to dig through his past, you just Googled his name on a certain website. \n\nSecond, he got mad at you because you didn't trust him and because you didn't trust him you found out that he was lying to you.\n\nIf he can't live up to his past and admit to his faults, this is not a long-term relationship.\n\nIt would be interesting to know, does he still get really drunk when he's with you?", "NTA.

I've change! \nNTA", "NTA - Look, it would be one thing if he didn't want to advertise to a new relationship that he had these DUI's hanging over him. Plenty of otherwise-decent folks may have things in their history that they aren't proud of,. But he really needed to own up to it when you started asking, and it's totally unsurprising that you would have looked into his background when you've only known him for a few months.\n\nHe had the opportunity to come clean when you came to him with what you found, but he instead chose to become accusatory towards you, and couldn't accept responsibility for his own actions to boot.\n\nYou mention that you are \"getting older\" - not sure what that means for you, but assuming that BF is also in your age range, I feel like it's safe to say that the guy has missed a lot of opportunities to grow up along the way, and doesn't seem like he's planning to grow up any time soon. \n\nYou didn't ask about this, but I'll answer like you did - yes, you should probably dump the guy; not for the background so much as for the way he's handling the revelation. You can do better.", "NTA I hope you meant ex-bf.", "NTA\n\nThe fact that he tried to hide it a mayor red flag. 5 duis means immature and overall stupid to me.", "NTA more people should do this, hasn't anyone watched law and order svu", "NTA.

That information is public & you felt something was off so you looked it up & he had a poor reaction to you finding out. Something else to consider: An average drunk driver has driven drunk over 80 times before first arrest. Sounds like this man has some red flags he\u2019s been trying to hide from you & now that you\u2019ve uncovered some he\u2019s trying to blame you instead of owning up to what he\u2019s done.", "Honestly NTA\n\nYou were right that he was being dishonest in some way and while personal and serious, it does not sound like he has learned his lesson in any way at all. \n\nEither he thinks it's not a big deal or he has a drinking problem he is not facing.", "NTA - it's call public information for a reason.  \n\nIn other topics.... RESPONSIBILITY!!!!  \n\nHe is essentially getting busted for driving under the influence.  Not once.  Multiple times.  \n\nSo many questions come to mind.  The biggest:\n1. Is this the person I want to have children with? \n\nHe clearly does not care and has a problem with substance abuse and responsible decision making.  Does not know his limits.  And will break the law for his own convenience.  Brings up the other big question: \n2. How likely is this partner to act in good faith to our relationship.  \n\nThe worst part is he feels you violated his privacy.  Its public information.  His ability to have a conversation about what is publicly available draws to question what other secrets he will keep. \n3. Am I really able to trust them?\n\nThe fact that this is all a surprise to you also calls into question:\n4. Are they being themselves with you?", "NTA. Your intuition was right. And he has no right telling you it's wrong not to trust him, when he has been lying to you about this for the entire time you've known him.", "NTA. This guy is wrong on so many levels. You were right to trust your intuitions.", "NTA in this situation.", "He isn't angry that you did the background check. He is angry because you know his secrets now. NTA.", "NTA, you have every right to know who you are dating, he should\u2019ve been truthful about his reasoning for not driving in the first place. I\u2019ve had my issues in the past and was always up front about it with people I was dating. Definitely NTA and he should definitely be your ex after this.", "6 DUI\u2019s? Run from this guy. He clearly values his own personal comfort over other people\u2019s lives. There\u2019s people in prison for 20 years for 5 dui\u2019s, he must be extremely lucky.", "NTA.  In new relationships a person needs to know if a partner can be trusted.  Perhaps this doesn't apply ... Ted Bundy's wife loved him and thought he was a great husband.  Further, all of his victims voluntarily went with him to their deaths.  The point is that people are in real danger, maybe not life threatening, but real at the beginning of relationships.  Truth is always important, but at the beginning it is more so.  If suspicions are aroused, a background check is certainly an option.  In this case, ending the relationship is probably the best choice because he is making excuses ... not apologizing for the lies.  My thoughts.  Your choice.", "NTA, can you tell me how much it costs and what service you used? Kinda wanna do one on myself.", "Does he still drink? He wants you to trust him, but he lied about why he didn\u2019t have a car. NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou were curious and concerned over very valid red flags.  You checked a PUBLIC listing which would only really if he had any criminal offenses in his past, something that is absolutely within your rights.  You've only been dating 3 months, and it's understandable to be concerned. \n\nThe next steps are going to be very important.  The fact that he hid the DUIs isn't necessarily a bad thing.  Again, this is a new relationship, and a person isn't going to tell you from the beginning: \"Hi!  I like you!  But I may have some legal issues that I have to deal with in the near future\".  But now that the word is out, how he reacts is going to be very important to watch.  Getting upset initially is understandable on his end, but if he blows it up any more than that, then you need to start calling him your EX boyfriend.", "NTA and you findings proved your instincts correct. Always trust yourself and your gut feelings. This is a very big lie to overcome. Especially, only three months into a relationship.", "NTA\n\nHe makes bad decisions and doesn\u2019t learn from mistakes.", "NTA it's imperative to know what you're getting yourself into. I was a single mom, and before I started dating my now husband I ran background checks on him and any other guy I started talking to. As a woman and mother you have to be vigilant in safety. What would have happened if it was domestic violence and he ended up beating you in the future? Definitely  NTA", "NTA.  \n\\> my states has a website of public crimes  \nIt is not much of a hidden background check if your state has a list of public crimes.\n\nIt seems like he got mad that you found out this \"secret\" and it seems like that he didn't trust you that you would understand this.\n\n\\> My bf and I have been dating for 3 months.

For ages. About something that matters. NTA and I hope you booted him.", "NTA \n\nYou have every right to look up any offences he has made.\n\nHis reaction is also very poor, if he\u2019s not told you this and he hasn\u2019t been honest upfront then it makes me wonder what else he won\u2019t/wouldn\u2019t tell you.", "NTA, you had a gut feeling something was off and followed it only to be proved right. i don\u2019t think what you did is much different to googling a family member out of boredom.", "NTA. You have a right to know when you\u2019re considering changing your entire life\u2019s trajectory for a person. Also as much as it may hurt, I think you need to let this guy go. He sounds like he\u2019s all talk and never actually changes his behavior.

I married a man who had nine DUIs. He got his license back after ten years clean. \nMajor addiction red flags there.\nHe wasn\u2019t honest with you, he has some work to do.", "NTA, and imo a background check on anyone with whom you might consider having a romantic, sexual, and/or cohabitating relationship is utterly and completely reasonable. I'd be disappointed if my wife hadn't at least Googled my name in our early days.\n\nNext step: find a new boyfriend.", "NTA, not being open and honest with you about his fuck ups is a massive red flag, my boyfriend's criminal record is long enough to be a small novel but from day 1 he has been 100% upfront and honest about it, anyone that would hide that stuff from the person they are seeing isn\u2019t trustworthy and isn\u2019t about to change their behaviour.", "NTA\n\nBF is using the old---the best defense is a good offense technique.  Turning it around to make you feel like you have done something wrong when it was in fact him.  Trust is earned.  It is not, and should not be the default in a relationship.  Especially when he is the one who has lied by omission.\n\nYou should think seriously about continuing a relationship with someone who clearly has an serious issue with alcohol and does not yet seem willing to take responsibility for it.  \n\nWhen we started dating my husband told me that he had a DUI a number of years before.  He shared the information with me himself.  We talked about it.  It has not happened again.", "NTA\nYou had some gut feeling, followed it and were right. He lied to you too. So you also have reasons to be mad.", "NTA. Its public information - you didnt get the info by deception, or reading his private communications  and you only checked when things didnt add up. The info is there for a reason. and people should expect that people look them up before dating them, hiring them etc.\n\nI dont get his argument that you didnt trust him. He is a serial liar. And there is no way you should think of marrying and having kids with someone so irresponsible that 5 times they get drunk behind the wheel. He could have killed  people each time, kids, innocent people. And lol at it being pinned on him - you can only go to court for a DUI if there is a breathalyser test, they then do a blood test.\n\nActually next time check someone for priors before you start dating them.", "NTA But please consider dumping this manipulative clown \ud83d\udea9", "NTA \n\nGlazing over this whole story, idk if all states are like this but mine this stuff is all public record.

You can't know someone well enough to know if they are the one and if they really are good people, if you have been together for only 3 months. A lot of people tend to pretend that they are better people than they actually are and/or they pretend and lie about who they are in general. Around the 3 month mark of a relationship is where that facade tends to start falling apart because they can no longer keep that up. I have had several relationships with men in the past that fell apart just after 3 months together because their facade had fallen down and I could finally see who they really were. They had tried to hide their bad habits and bad qualities of their personalities and they had pretended to be someone better, someone that appealed to me. After I saw them for who they reallt were, I knew I deserved better and broke up with them. That is how I learned that people may hide who they really are for a while. It often comes apparent around the 3 month mark or even earlier. Sometimes they can hide it for up to 6 months or longer.\n\nSo what I want ti say is: don't give up on love and romance but also be careful and keep an eye open for anything suspicious. And don't move too fast in a relationship and get too serieus too soon (like moving in together, getting engaged or getting married within a year of being together). \n\nSome people get lucky, know they have found the one instantly and get married within a few months and enjoy a happy long life together. But many others think and feel they have found the one only to find out a little while later they were conned and they were now in a shitty situation.\n\nYou are not in control of others and what they do. You are only in control of yourself. You can be good and honest and someone that is worthy of being trusted because you show the real you and don't hide anything.\n\n\n\nAlso please dump that AH if a boyfriend you have.

I hadnt really thought about it, but I think it\u2019s smart.\n\nThe only reason someone would feel offended by it is if they were embarrassed by getting caught out.\n\nThis dude is a public fucking menace, repeat drunk drivers like your mate need to be named, shamed and ostracised until it occurs to them an Uber ride is much cheaper than a family\u2019s lives. Fuck drunk drivers and fuck fucking liars! Fuck!", "NTA. people can sometimes be secret killers. You did what you had to do. Imagine if you didn\u2019t look this information up and he got behind the wheel of your car drunk \u2026", "NTA , he\u2019s mad you caught him out", "NTA\n\nDump him immediately! He\u2019s showing absolutely no signs of remorse or regret, and he\u2019s still lying that the last DUI was a setup. He hasn\u2019t changed.", "Why would you even bother to see him again.  He has had 5 drunk driving incidents and lied about it.  What else do you need to know?", "NTA.  Your background check just might have saved your life.\n\nAnd in my opinion drunk driving is one of the worst, most selfish crimes imaginable.  If he's had 5-6 dui's he has basically decided that everyone else's lives around him are not as important as his decision to drive somewhere after drinking.\n\nAnd those are only the times he's gotten caught driving while intoxicated.  Imagine how many times he's done it where he didn't get caught.", "NTA and big yikes.", "Good girlfriends become miserable wives.", "I'm sorry 3 months? You don't need the internet. 3 years then I mean maybe as you would have made a significant investment in time. But 3 months? YTA if you don't break up with him immediately and recalibrate your \"the one\" compass.", "NTA clearly he was lying to your face and would have gone on with continuing the lie for as long as he can. It's not a bad idea at all to do a background check on anyone you're getting serious with. Move on and find someone else, this guy clearly has a history of bad judgment and lying.", "NTA- I grew up with an alcoholic father who lost his license. I will never forget someone in Al-anon saying \u201canyone who drinks and is human could get a DUI, but only someone with a drinking problem would not treat that as a wake up call.\u201d Hiding, lying, and trying to blame you are all great alcoholic moves. Run FAST.", "NTA, you just checked public records. That's not his \"personal info,\" that's public knowledge.", "Not the Asshole. Save yourself and dump him.", "NTA\n\nIdk maybe it was invading his \"privacy\", but this is all public information. It's not really a background check.\n\nThis is important information that he withheld from you. He didn't let you have an informed choice about whether or not you wanted to date someone with so many DUIs. What if you ended up pregnant and he couldn't drive you to the hospital or he couldn't get a job because of his record or lack of transport? This also would have affected you and you had the right to know.\n\nAnd not only did he not let you know he also actively lied to you. That's red flag city.", "NTA. He's mad you caught him. He's had multiple opportunities to tell the truth and he didn't. You have no reason to trust him at this point. Additionally, 5 DUIs means he doesn't learn his lesson, he's probably got a drinking problem, and he has no regard for human life. His excuses show he has no sense of accountability. You peeled back the onion and found out it was rotten. Time to move on.", "NTA. I'm sorry but in this day and age, I am Googling everybody. \n\nImagine that you could've found out that a guy you started seeing was a serious offender and you could've found out on day 1 via web search but decided not to because you thought you were \"being a good girlfriend by not just trusting him.\"", "I was ready to say Y T A, but what you didn't wasn't a background check, it was simply searching publicly available info. NTA.", "NTA. Get rid.", "NTA. Trust is earned.", "NTA. What you did isn\u2019t even a background check, it\u2019s public information that likely would have come up in a Google search. His expectation that you blindly trust him is ridiculous", "NTA. At all. He clearly has an issue with being honest about who he is and I\u2019d wonder what else he\u2019s been hiding..", "NTA \n\nAnd he's an alcoholic.  \n\nRun!", "NTA - when you said background check in the title I thought you meant you got someone to investigate him but all you did was google publicly available information. 5 DUIs is supremely effed up and he needs his licence permanently revoked. It also suggests he likely has a drinking problem.", "NTA. Doing basic research on someone you want a long term committed relationship with isn't wrong. In your particular instance he behaved suspicious because he was obviously lying and hiding things. Though I am confused why he is whining about Ubers i he makes good money?\n\n5 DUI's with the most recent remaining to be litigated? He is almost certainly going to be doing some amount of jail time as well. Id be amazed if he didnt at least do 9-12 months with potential of several years.", "You confronted him, about his lies, and instead of admitting and taking responsibility for his wrong behaviors, he blames you, gets angry at you, and claims he doesn't have to tell you things.  This is not a man, let alone one to build a life with.  He's just made it very clear that you cannot trust him to tell you the truth, and that when you find out his lies, he blames you for finding out, not himself for lying.  This is the basic behavior of manipulators and abusers.    \n\nIt's time to stop answering his calls and not letting him into your place.  He's not changed, he's a liar, and he's not trustworthy.  He will make your life a hell, if you keep letting him in your life.", "NTA... and I'm going to be extremely blunt here. You've been shown who this guy is today. If you ignore it and stick around thinking he will change, anything bad that happens to you or your children at this guys hands after today is your fault.", "NTA. Your BF lied by omission. This is something he should have told you. 5 DUIs??? His friends knew. No wonder he doesn\u2019t drive. And he lied about that. Cars are expensive? That\u2019s not why he wasn\u2019t driving. You have the right to know what you\u2019re getting into. Now you know. BF may have a serious drinking problem.", "NTA and dump him now.", ">he got angry at me for not trusting him \n\nSo he wasn't apologetic he was deceitful to you?  He was angry you called him on his BS?  This should tell you everything you need to know about him.\n\n\n>I asked him to show me proof and he said he doesn\u2019t have to and if I was a good gf I would just trust him. \n\nBecause he was so trustworthy before to hide 6 DUIs before?  Especially when his last DUI was 3 months before you met?  \n\nNTA", "NTA. It\u2019s public record not \u201cpersonal information\u201d. I imagine the only thing that changed between 6 months ago and now is maybe he totaled his last car/got his license revoked at the last charge. I guess anyone can be cured of poor choices when you literally don\u2019t have the means to make them. \n\nI would say based on his record, how hard he tried to keep it a secret, and his reaction (blaming you for \u201cinfiltrating his personal life\u201d) that he is not \u201cthe one\u201d to settle for. You deserve better.\n\nEdit: Just a note that searching public record does not equate to a \u201cbackground check\u201d, so some of the arguments against your actions aren\u2019t really valid if all you did was search public databases.", "NTA\nIt was public data. But you should evaluate this relationship pretty hard and decide if you can move past his multiple arrests", "NTA- not only did he lie to you directly with the doctors appointment, he has neglected to tell you about his very real and public issues, and dating someone for more than a month getting serious I feel like you should be aware if someone struggles with alcoholism or mental health issues even if they\u2019re in recovery", "NTA \n\nBelieve me when I tell you he is an ALCOHOLIC.  Run!", "NTA. I would do this on anyone I dated (and did when I met my husband). I\u2019m not interested in people who are being sued, on trial, or just have shitty financial judgement. For just starting to date, I\u2019m still not interested in getting involved even if it was a mistake.", "How is he not in jail after 5 DUIs.  I thought the punishment escalates with every DUI conviction.", "It's literally public information, it's made public so that everyone knows what the person has done and can react accordingly.\n\nAnd we can't stress this enough but 5 times is a lot of times and I don't believe he's changed in 6 months. He just doesn't have a car now, so he hasn't been able to get a DUI", "Yeah, run.  The DUIs are one big issue, but the lying and tapdancing around it is bigger.  You can't trust him.  What's next?  Another DUI or something else?  Run.", "At this stage in my life, not having a car in a city without consistant public transportation is a legit reason to at least take a few beats to figure out what the cause is. I went on a few dates with a guy recently and it took me a minute to realize that he was catching Ubers everywhere that he went. He seemed like a nice guy, but is started getting weird after a while. I never got to the bottom of it, but I realized he was an odd one. Not having a car was just the first warning sign.", "To be fair, Ted Bundy's wife married him when he was already on trial for multiple murders. She was warned. \n\nHe did have a long term partner when he was arrested, that might be who you are thinking of. She was the one who tipped the police off though so she also had her suspicions.", "Not to mention they would have had him blow a Breathalyzer or done a blood test, so 'pinning' things on him is BS.  NTA!", "Had a coworker with 13 against him. And a few DVs. Dude was a piece of work.", "Not sure where OP lives, but I know here in Wisconsin, there had been people on the news with 15+ DUIs and basically got slaps on the wrists. They haven't killed anyone yet, so they just handle whatever fines and jail time they get, then go back to their lives. It's absolute garbage.", "It really depends on the state (and I say state because I don't know if other countries use the phrase \"DUI\"). Different states have a lot of variation on these laws.", "The dude clearly has an issue, clearly he has no issue with the moral aspect of potentially killing someone. But how can you justify the financial aspect? DUIs are fucking expensive, like after you get 2 a normal person would be like fuck I have to change. 3 and now it's insane. After 4 your life is fucked and at 5 you've gotta be clinically insane", "Yup. When she asked about why he didn't drive that would of been the point to fess up. Not sure what his long term plan was, where I am at least it's a long expensive process for a person to get their license back after that.", ">Also, they\u2019ve only been dating for 3 months. She even calls it early days in her second sentence. That\u2019s not really long enough to know for sure whether you can completely trust someone.\n\nI don't agree with this. They're 3 months in and she's pretty serious about it. \n\nNot to mention that if it's 6 months from his most recent arrest, they met 3 months after it. Yeah, I'd want to know early on that someone had an open court case pending for a very recent DUI, especially since it's his 5th one.\n\nWhile not easy and messy, you have to go into relationships with open communication about your past issues. While it's not material you bring up on the initial first date, it's certainly something that needs to come up when you realize you aren't dating other people and are having serious feelings for someone.", "OP, this guy is a bold faced liar - and after 5 DUI's, he is the luckiest habitual criminal, ever. Thankfully he didn't kill anyone, but I'm wondering how he has escaped prison time after so many offences.\n\nNTA. Also, there is no telling what else he is hiding if he lied to you so easily. He is only trying to manipulate you into thinking you did something wrong because he got caught lying.", "As another justice system worker (for over 25 years) in US, I totally agree.\n\nFirst DUII (after diversion) is a bad decision.\n\nSecond is a relapse.\n\nThird is a serious problem.\n\nSix? \n\nYikes!  If you are in US, he could be going to prison this time.  I would hate to be that guy\u2018s defense attorney.\n\nETA: any time you are arrested for DUII it is a serious problem. But the more times you are arrested, the harder it is to treat the underlying issue and the more likely you are to be an alcoholic in need of serious care and intervention.", "ugh I\u2019m so glad it\u2019s a felony charge in Canada", "Plus, you know, the fact that he's an alcoholic and she didn't know. While non-alcoholics definitely **do** get drunk and get DUIs, **not** 5 times. That's an unrepentant drinker right there. Fact is, after each DUI, in a lot of states, to get your license back you have to have a breathalyzer installed in your vehicle for at least 6 months, which is probably why he doesn't have more. NTA OP, dump this dangerous guy.", "After this many DUI's I wouldn't be surprised if it's permanent now. Depends on the State I think, and how bad his BAC was.", "She did ask, and he lied to her.", "I\u2019m not saying that it\u2019s right he didn\u2019t tell her, I\u2019m saying that it makes sense she didn\u2019t blindly trust him.", "Depends on the jurisdiction, in Missouri passengers can drink in the car. But it's still a good idea to transport any opened containers in the trunk just in case.", "Oh! Yeah I agree with that. 3 months in you\u2019re still building trust.", "They've know each other for a minute. He may be ashamed of that part of him.\n\nAnd as I said, I was just making a blanket statement about recovery being hard for people. I don't know enough about this particular situation to say he is for sure in recovery.\n\nEither way, they both need to stop seeing each other because they don't trust each other."]}
