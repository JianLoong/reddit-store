When he moved in the neighbour that shares the land between his and her property (she lives in a rented house) parked her car there. \n\nAt first we didn\u2019t mind because she had two young children and didn\u2019t want to park her car in front of her house. Fine, no skin off our back. \n\nA few months went by and things were okay until my fianc\u00e9 started to go to work on his motorbike, which he usually does in the summer. He keeps his motorbikes locked in a garage to the rear of his property. \n\nAll of a sudden she started to be sour to us and constantly complain that his bike was too loud and he was scaring her kids and damaging her property. He was doing none of this. \n\nBecause of the way she has parked her car my fianc\u00e9 struggled to get his bike passed her car to then go to work. So he began to ask her not to park her car there so that he could get his bike past and not have to struggle. \n\nFor context my fianc\u00e9 is an army veteran and has a leg injury so struggles to walk a lot of the time. \n\nShe moved the car but low and behold a week later it would be back on the shared land. So again he would ask her to move her car and she would begrudgingly agree. \n\nThen out of nowhere she began to send us pictures of \u201cscratches\u201d and \u201cdeliberate damage\u201d my fianc\u00e9 did to her car. \n\nAfter this finally we had enough, so he contacted our local council, we live in the UK and she is a council tenant. \n\nHe was told there is nothing to be done and he would need to ask in a civil manner that she not park there because it blocked his access. \n\nWell, that she did not like. \n\nSuddenly she reports my fianc\u00e9 as a menace, that he intimidates her and her children. Revs his bike at all hours of the night and morning. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 really doesn\u2019t like confrontation so this whole thing was making him so uncomfortable. \n\nEventually I had enough so I contacted at many people as I could. The council, the police and lawyers just to find if something can be done to help. \n\nThe best we got was an official letter stating that neither parties can park a vehicle again and because so many companies have been made against her now that she may get kicked out of her home. \n\nI feel terrible because she has too small children and no job. \n\nSo am AITA?", "created_utc": 1674138988, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10g38yh/aita_for_calling_the_authorities_on_my_neighbour/", "score": 427, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
