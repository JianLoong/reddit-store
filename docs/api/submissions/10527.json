Each point can stand on its own as concerning enough, but put together it\u2019s downright alarming, because it\u2019s not just about disrespecting your time and taking advantage of your skills - suddenly it\u2019s escalated to not caring if you live or die..? It\u2019s so strange. You write that you explained why you weren\u2019t coming, I\u2019m just wondering if your mom truly understood what happened to you. Of course, the words \u2018emergency surgery\u2019 should tell her what she needs to know and make her drop everything. \n\nAbsolutely NTA, OP. Take care of yourself and feel better soon.", "NTA but your family are especially your mother who wasn\u2019t in the slightest worry you had to have an emergency surgery with a NEUROSURGEON!  Neurosurgeons don\u2019t do ordinary surgeries like gull bladders. They do brain surgeries and taking discs out, either one has major recovery times. Brain surgeries being the worst and the ones with discs or operating on your spinal column in any way is no piece of cake. She should have been at the hospital instead of a damned wedding that could be rescheduled!", "NTA I can\u2019t get past the sentence about your sister announcing that she was giving a surprise birthday party for herself. How was that supposed to work? It sounds like the joke people sometimes make about having such a poor memory that they could hide their own Easter eggs. \n\nAfter being gobsmacked by your first sentence, I finally read on and learned that the \u201csurprise\u201d was not telling you\u2014and only you\u2014that (checks notes) it was actually her wedding, apparently out of a desire to trick you into being the unpaid wedding photographer. \n\nThen comes the nasty twist when you feel so ill that you needed emergency surgery and all the family can do is complain that you had the nerve miss the \u201csurprise birthday party\u201d due to being in the OR!  Your sister is truly an AH from a different realm and so is the rest of your family.\nEdit: typo", "So they are upset cause they didn\u2019t get a free photographer. Did your mom even ask if you ok?! What a terrible family", "NTA but why be upset? You actually dodged a bullet.  They didn't feel the need to notify you that you would be providing free photography services for your sister's wedding.  So, they were using you with the pretense it was a surprise BD party.  GTFOH, your family sucks.", "NTA but it sounds like your family is AWFUL! I'm sorry for all your medical issues right now that is terrifying. The fact that your MOTHERS response to your news is to be upset that you aren't there to be tricked into doing wedding photographery for free is absolutely disgusting! I hope your surgery went well and you are on the mend.", "Who plans herself a surprise party & then talks about it for months in advance? I feel like that was the first clue to the weirdness of this whole thing. Additionally, NTA. Your family is insane. Did ANYONE ask after your health??", "NTA\n\nThey didn't tell you because you were expected to work for free.  They knew it was wrong and that you'd ask to be paid.  Your family sucks for being angry about you not working for free and ignoring that you had to have emergency surgery.", "NTA Boy is your sister cheap. Or maybe the cost of your relationship with her made that the most expensive asshole behavior she has ever done. Tell your asshole mother that you wouldn't have photographed the wedding anyway so she can shut her yap, and screw her for not caring that you were hospitalized.", "NTA. I had a surprise wedding. I hired an outside photographer who was in on it. You have to tell your vendors. That is surprise wedding 101.\n\nAlso you had emergency surgery and their reaction was to be mad at you? That\u2019s so weird. I hope you\u2019re doing better. That sounds really scary. I would probably be mad at my family if I told them I was having emergency surgery and everyone missed being with me because (I thought) they were at my sister\u2019s birthday party. If anyone has a right to be mad it\u2019s you.", "Nta", "NTA, your family sucks and doesn\u2019t like you very much. They tried to trick you to take advantage of a free service AND don\u2019t care that you\u2019re seemingly seriously ill. I hope you have some other support because I would cut those fake ass losers out of your life.", "NTA.\n\nYou would have been NTA if you knew about the wedding. You would have been NTA if they asked you to photograph it and you said no. Honestly, the only way you would have been ta is if you showed up, punched their properly-hired photog and insisted on doing it yourself with an iphone 8. \n\nI'm friends with a few photographers and one thing I would NEVER do is ask them to take pics at an event like a wedding. Mostly because, if they're friends enough to be there at all, they're going to be guests and not working. I honestly think it's a huge asshole move in and of itself just to ask you to work at a wedding. \n\nAlso wtf, not even telling you it's a wedding? A surprise birthday party for herself? \n\nThis is a weird-ass set of circumstances.", "I was wondering how a wedding figured into this story. So, you had a medical emergency (hope you're doing better) and your mother is ticked that you weren't on hand to work as a photographer at what you understood to be a surprise birthday party. Your family is strange. I'd keep my distance from these people. NTA.", "NTA \n\nYour family is appalling. Why do they expect free labor and where was the concern for you?", "I wouldn\u2019t reply. I\u2019d block them and move on with my life. I have taken this approach with family before and it\u2019s far easier.", "Wait, you had some sort of neurological surgery, and they are pissed you didn't show up?  Was there no concern from your mom that you were operated on and in the hospital?  I think you're asking the wrong question here.  Of course you are NTA for not taking pictures.  I would be far more upset that no one apparently cared about your health.", "NTA\n\nGeez, are you alright?", "NTA, and what is wrong with your family?! \n\nWas there some emotional significance in this for you, or were they literally just trying to get free labor for a wedding photography package (I hope you would have either walked away or held those photos hostage)? And no one in the family had the morals to let you know for MONTHS? How was it a \"surprise\" birthday party if she was throwing it for herself and planning it for months? You needed emergency surgery, and their first response is being upset that you weren't going to be there?  \n\nHonestly, this would be shitty behavior to a stranger, much less to a family member. Photoshop some clown makeup on your family portraits, because that's all they are.", "NTA at all. They didn\u2019t tell you about the wedding so you would be pressured into taking pictures for free the whole time instead of enjoying yourself. So sorry that none of them care about the fact you were going into surgery! Hope you are doing better!", "NTA. I don't even know what I read here. She never invites you over, doesn't even tell you she's getting married, even your mom lies to you about it. Then you end up having emergency service and then your mom dares to be mad? She should be insanely worried.\n\nThese people tried to trick you into doing free photography for your sisters wedding. You sure these people are family?", "Holy smokes, NTA.\n\nFirst of all, regardless of how you ended up in the hospital, your family should be concerned for your health. I can think of one particular reason that your family would be out of sorts for you ending up in the hospital, but that still doesn't mean they should neglect concern for you. \n\nSecond, why do they think it's okay to rope you into being a free wedding photographer? At the very least, you may not have all the proper tools (I'm sorry, but I'm just not familiar enough with all the tools used in professional photography, so I can't provide examples) required to deliver the quality you'd want for them or that would be expected. \n\nThere is SO much to process in this story.\n\nIt won't change my verdict, but I'd be remiss to not ask for more INFO:\n1) Why is it a surprise birthday party? I'm not calling you, specifically, out on this, but why is that such an insistent descriptor for her when it isn't a) a surprise, and b) a surprise to HER (she's planning it). It being planned for months only seems off because she's part of the process. \n2) Why does the wedding have to be a surprise for you? And no one else? Nothing about this makes sense.\n\nLike, the only possible situation where family members act quite so cagey around one member in particular is when that one person has an addiction and is not yet trying to address it. Even then, the way they treat you doesn't add up to that being the case, and this whole situation makes no sense whatsoever. \n\nGet some rest and recover. You've every right to be upset with them, but definitely brush off their reaction. Their only concern should be for your health, not being butthurt because you getting hurt stopped them from manipulating you.", "NTA  \n\n\nYou had emergency surgery...yet your mum was pissed because you couldn't be at the wedding you didn't know about. F that. Your mum is TA.  \n\n\nThey tried to freeload a wedding shoot. Your sister has never invited you to her house, but did so when she needed to mooch. Your sister is also TA.  \n\n\nDid anyone get concerned? Have they bothered to help you after your surgery? Think about ignoring them for a while, and concentrate on getting better.", "NTA. You had emergency neurosurgery and all you family cares about is a surprise wedding which apparently everyone but you knew about. What a bunch of jerks, I\u2019m sorry you have to call these people family OP.", "FAFO. Nta", "This is just all around weird. NTA but I am confused. Who does that?", "If you missed the \u201csurprise party\u201d for any reason you\u2019re NTA. Add the health scare in there and it\u2019s not even a question. Your family\u2019s super weird and those are not normal reactions. Hope you\u2019re recovered and on the mend OP.", "Nta at all.  Even if you didn't have surgery and you walked into the house and discovered they tricked you, you still would not be the asshole.", "NTA. You have abusive family members.", "NTA OMG I\u2019d be FURIOUS. So you\u2019re at the hospital they are pissed you can\u2019t make it? Why the hell would they lie to you? That would hurt me very deeply and after that I wouldn\u2019t want to talk to them unless they fucking begged. Something very wrong with them.", "NTA. If they wanted a photographer for their wedding they should have hired one.", "a. surprise. wedding.\nThis sounds like a bad idea, just from the getgo.

Don't see hope you're ok. From here on out I'd forget my camera at home every family get together.", "You were in the hospital and they were trying to scam you into taking her wedding photos for free. \n\nEither one of those would make you NTA \n\nTogether, well, mom and sister have warned you to never bring your cameras and equipment with you to any family events ever again.", "NTA. Did they even care you had to go to the ER?", "Are you okay?", "INFO: So EVERYBODY knew it was actually your sisters wedding - not birthday - and they didn\u2019t tell *you specifically* because they wanted it to be a surprise?\u2026 for you? What???", "NTA. wow your family is messed up. Your mom was more upset over loss of a free photographer than the health of her child. I'm so sorry and I hope you get well soon.", "Nta", "NTA\n\nWhat? Your family is bizzare. \nWhy would they have the obviously planned wedding be a suprise to you only?  Why would they get mad that you were missing it when you are literally in the hospital having emergency surgery?", "So much to unpack here:\n\n1. They nag you into providing photography services for free for the \u2018birthday party\u2019\n\n2. Instead of being concerned that you\u2019re undergoing life threatening surgery her reaction to being told you can\u2019t make it is to be angry rather than concerned. \n\n3. She still attends the wedding instead of being at your bedside. \n\n4. They know this was a shitty deceptive thing to do because literally everyone knew this was a wedding except you. \n\n5. I would imagine doing photography for a full on wedding requires planning, certain equipment etc rather than a few casual birthday shots. So they were expecting you to pull off no doubt professional quality work with no notice, no payment and no gratitude. \n\nWhy do you bother with these people you call your family? I mean if they gave a shit about you none of this would have happened. NTA", "SURPRISE! We need you to work and call it a surprise! \n\nNTA, cut them all off.", "Your mother is a piece of work\n\nYou are not the asshole", "NTA\n\nWhat the hell is going on here?!? \n\nFirst, who throws their own surprise party? That makes no sense! Who's getting surprised? The guests at how vain you are?!?\n\nSecond, only because its in the order you mention it as this is more important! Where was your family when you went into hospital? Did anyone care you had to have emergency surgery? \n\nAnd now third because I'm a retired wedding photographer. Who the hell thinks they can make up an elaborate scheme to get free wedding photos? My rule was if I was a guest at a wedding, the camera stayed home, I want to enjoy the wedding, not work it. Family should never be expected to photograph a wedding, it's a lot of work and you get no downtime to enjoy any of it.", "NTA\n\nIt was a surprise ambush to get free photos. This has nothing to do with recognizing you as a family member or human being.", "NTA\n\nExcuse me, WTF?  They decided you were supposed to be the photographer for a wedding without telling you?  Absolutely not.  Professional photographers get paid big bucks for doing weddings.  They sign contracts. If something happens and they have an emergency, they send a colleague and make sure the event is covered.  \n\nYour mother and sister tried to get free wedding photos and they lost.  They fact they were upset with you not being there to take photos when you were having a medical emergency says it all.  They were being cheap AHs.", "Whoa! This wasn't a surprise, this was a trick.

What did they tell the rest of the family when they said to not tell OP it's actually a wedding? So many questions!", "I had an appendectomy at 16. It nearly burst because I\u2019m deathly afraid of hospitals and I refused to go until I was literally crawling because it was too painful to walk", "Yess appendix surgery is very dangerous, and it is an emergency surgery, not a cosmetic one. This person needs to get their facts straight", "Sameee", "I was gonna bring in an element of cannibalism..", "My husband spent 13 days in intensive care after a ruptured appendix. It's not always bandaid surgery.", "My appendix ruptured and had been leaking into my abdomen for 12 hours. I was in the hospital for a while just because they were afraid I'd go septic, and the pain was no joke. I'm sitting in the ER with my husband right now, waiting to get a room for surgery because he has appendicitis. People still die from it!", "(Jeebus! So, beyond becoming a Wheeling Dead he would also be a cannibal?)\n\n/I feel this has become a crossover between The Twilight Zone, Weekend at Bernie's and a Treehouse of Terror special.", "For me it was. Mine had burst and I was in hospital for a long time. I was told that the surgeon who operated on me called in the next day to ask if I was still alive. All that because when I went to hospital the first time the doctor said it\u2019s probably just a little tummy ache and sent me home", "I\u2019m waiting for your update when you realize that you are better off without them and go no contact. \n\nI hope you have a speedy recovery.", "Nta but your whole family is.  You were in the hospital and they still went through with this stupid charade!  They were just using you and they, especially you own mother, didn't care. Ignore these selfish aholes.", "Your sister is a MAJOR asshole on many levels. She's selfish, rude, manipulative and narcissistic, and I pity her husband. I don't even know where to begin:\n\n1. Has never invited you to her house.\n2. Told everyone but you that she was getting married.\n3. Was planning to use you to avoid paying a photographer.\n4. Didn't give a crap that you needed emergency surgery.\n5. Got MAD at you for needing said surgery.\n\nWhat the hell is wrong with her????", "Surprise!  It's not a birthday party, it's a wedding and you have to spend all your time photographing everyone.  This wasn't a surprise it was an ambush to get you to do free work for an entire party.\n\nAlso, I agree with everyone else, where was your mother's concern for your health?\n\nNTA", "Right there with you buddy! I've been talking a lot about media literacy lately, developing intuition for fake stories through experience... This one's throwing me, though. My litmus test is, if I were forced to bet money on this, which way would I go? I would go fake here, but... I wouldn't volunteer to bet on it, either, lol", "This! Even if we left out the part of OP needing emergency surgery, the fact ONLY the OP was not in on this big secret makes OP NTA. \n\nAnd I'm not a photographer but wouldn't they want different equipment for a wedding shoot than for a \"simple\" birthday party shoot?", "This here is some real soap opera nonsense.\n\nNTA, I hope your recovery is smooth and uneventful.", "NTA and your family is awful. Hope you\u2019re well. I hope your family realizes your value as a person and not just your skills.", "NTA because your family is super weird.   They only wanted the wedding to be a surprise for you, the sibling?   Your mother cared more about the ruined limited surprise/getting you to photograph the wedding for free than she did about the fact that you needed emergency neurosurgery?\n\nNone of that makes any sense.  But if they are going to act in such an incomprehensible way, that's not your fault.  They are all the A Hs.  Just be glad you missed the wedding - that's a big win.", "NTA\n\nThis seems like the perfect time to disown your entire family. Anyone who hasn\u2019t checked on your health is out.", "NTA \ud83d\ude02 they all basically tried to trick you into being a photographer for the day for free. Instead of being concerned with your health and they were upset they didn\u2019t get a free photographer fuck that.", "Your sister didn't tell you she was getting married? WTF?\n\nAnd then everyone knows it's a wedding by you, her sister? WTF?\n\nYou were in the hospital and they are mad you didn't show up? WTF?\n\nNTA.", "Long term emotional abuse is a hell of a thing", "She sounds like a narcissist. The chameleon act is to build up her army of unsuspecting flying monkeys. \n\nBut after what happened with the emergency neurosurgery and their lack of support and compassion, I would try limiting contact. LC or even NC will probably be very beneficial for you, especially while you recover.", "Me too.  But maybe op made a booboo on that.  What with the brain surgery and all", "Omg what? They wanted to surprise you with unpaid work and didn\u2019t care you had emergency surgery!! Nope", "NTA. Anyone getting pissy about someone missing an event because they needed emergency surgery (or ended up admitted to the hospital for any reason) is an AH. \n\nOne of the things your family really doesn\u2019t seem to grasp is that they type of event wouldn\u2019t have changed the outcome. Completely glossing over the fact that it seems like you are surrounded by crazy people who a) don\u2019t seem to care that you went through a serious health issue and b) either support the idea of or throw themselves fake surprise birthday weddings. Bottom line here is that even if you *had* known it was a wedding, you *still* would have gone to the emergency room the day before and needed surgery.", "Did you mean, \"Am I an asshole for needing emergency surgery?\" \n\nNo, no you are not. \n\nNTA\n\nBut I would seriously consider going NC with a family that considered a party - regardless of birthday, wedding, surprise, or whatever else - more important than a family member needing *emergency neuro surgery.*", "Why would a photographer be afraid to go to the hospital?", "I mean any surgery that you get the next day after diagnosing it's necessity is seriously important.", "My spinal surgery is gonna be fine. My spinal surgery is gonna be fine. I won't end up a paraplegic. It's gonna be totally fine. @_@", "I had appendectomy when i was 10yrs old.\nI was admitted to hospital in the midnight as i had severe stomach pain from that evening and my parents took me to clinic near by and was given pain killers.\nAt 10 or 11pm i said to my parents that I feel like i might die with this pain and then my parents panicked and took me to hospital. \nI had an emergency operation the very day reports came in.", "I recently had a lap to check for endo because I have really bad tummy issues and they found my intestines and stuff were snarled up with scar tissue from my appendectomy. It doesn't seem to have helped anything by removing it, admittedly, but it was wild to me to hear that after like 15 years.", "I had horrible pain in my torso and back. My boyfriend told me to \"walk it off\" and acted unconcerned. My gallbladder had ruptured.", "Mine didn't burst but the pain was unbearable. I was on the floor crying. It was an emergency surgery because they didn't want it to burst. I actually diagnosed myself with WebMD. I initially didn't want to go to the ER.", "American here. Most photographers would likely be self employed, or even doing it as a part time side gig, thus no or not very great health insurance. And, if you didn't know, healthcare in america is horrendously expensive. That surgery may cost more than a year's wages.\n\nJust an ambulance ride to the hospital can cost hundreds of dollars - for context, at minimum wage, working 40 hours a week, someone will make around 1000 dollars a month after taxes.", "Outrageous cost of healthcare in the US. Specifically, how going to the ER can literally bankrupt you even with insurance."]}
