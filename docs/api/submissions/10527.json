Each point can stand on its own as concerning enough, but put together it\u2019s downright alarming, because it\u2019s not just about disrespecting your time and taking advantage of your skills - suddenly it\u2019s escalated to not caring if you live or die..? It\u2019s so strange. You write that you explained why you weren\u2019t coming, I\u2019m just wondering if your mom truly understood what happened to you. Of course, the words \u2018emergency surgery\u2019 should tell her what she needs to know and make her drop everything. \n\nAbsolutely NTA, OP. Take care of yourself and feel better soon.", "NTA but your family are especially your mother who wasn\u2019t in the slightest worry you had to have an emergency surgery with a NEUROSURGEON!  Neurosurgeons don\u2019t do ordinary surgeries like gull bladders. They do brain surgeries and taking discs out, either one has major recovery times. Brain surgeries being the worst and the ones with discs or operating on your spinal column in any way is no piece of cake. She should have been at the hospital instead of a damned wedding that could be rescheduled!", "NTA I can\u2019t get past the sentence about your sister announcing that she was giving a surprise birthday party for herself. How was that supposed to work? It sounds like the joke people sometimes make about having such a poor memory that they could hide their own Easter eggs. \n\nAfter being gobsmacked by your first sentence, I finally read on and learned that the \u201csurprise\u201d was not telling you\u2014and only you\u2014that (checks notes) it was actually her wedding, apparently out of a desire to trick you into being the unpaid wedding photographer. \n\nThen comes the nasty twist when you feel so ill that you needed emergency surgery and all the family can do is complain that you had the nerve miss the \u201csurprise birthday party\u201d due to being in the OR!  Your sister is truly an AH from a different realm and so is the rest of your family.\nEdit: typo", "So they are upset cause they didn\u2019t get a free photographer. Did your mom even ask if you ok?! What a terrible family", "NTA but why be upset? You actually dodged a bullet.  They didn't feel the need to notify you that you would be providing free photography services for your sister's wedding.  So, they were using you with the pretense it was a surprise BD party.  GTFOH, your family sucks.", "NTA but it sounds like your family is AWFUL! I'm sorry for all your medical issues right now that is terrifying. The fact that your MOTHERS response to your news is to be upset that you aren't there to be tricked into doing wedding photographery for free is absolutely disgusting! I hope your surgery went well and you are on the mend.", "Who plans herself a surprise party & then talks about it for months in advance? I feel like that was the first clue to the weirdness of this whole thing. Additionally, NTA. Your family is insane. Did ANYONE ask after your health??", "NTA\n\nThey didn't tell you because you were expected to work for free.  They knew it was wrong and that you'd ask to be paid.  Your family sucks for being angry about you not working for free and ignoring that you had to have emergency surgery.", "NTA Boy is your sister cheap. Or maybe the cost of your relationship with her made that the most expensive asshole behavior she has ever done. Tell your asshole mother that you wouldn't have photographed the wedding anyway so she can shut her yap, and screw her for not caring that you were hospitalized.", "NTA. I had a surprise wedding. I hired an outside photographer who was in on it. You have to tell your vendors. That is surprise wedding 101.\n\nAlso you had emergency surgery and their reaction was to be mad at you? That\u2019s so weird. I hope you\u2019re doing better. That sounds really scary. I would probably be mad at my family if I told them I was having emergency surgery and everyone missed being with me because (I thought) they were at my sister\u2019s birthday party. If anyone has a right to be mad it\u2019s you.", "Nta", "NTA, your family sucks and doesn\u2019t like you very much. They tried to trick you to take advantage of a free service AND don\u2019t care that you\u2019re seemingly seriously ill. I hope you have some other support because I would cut those fake ass losers out of your life.", "NTA.\n\nYou would have been NTA if you knew about the wedding. You would have been NTA if they asked you to photograph it and you said no. Honestly, the only way you would have been ta is if you showed up, punched their properly-hired photog and insisted on doing it yourself with an iphone 8. \n\nI'm friends with a few photographers and one thing I would NEVER do is ask them to take pics at an event like a wedding. Mostly because, if they're friends enough to be there at all, they're going to be guests and not working. I honestly think it's a huge asshole move in and of itself just to ask you to work at a wedding. \n\nAlso wtf, not even telling you it's a wedding? A surprise birthday party for herself? \n\nThis is a weird-ass set of circumstances.", "I was wondering how a wedding figured into this story. So, you had a medical emergency (hope you're doing better) and your mother is ticked that you weren't on hand to work as a photographer at what you understood to be a surprise birthday party. Your family is strange. I'd keep my distance from these people. NTA.", "NTA \n\nYour family is appalling. Why do they expect free labor and where was the concern for you?", "I wouldn\u2019t reply. I\u2019d block them and move on with my life. I have taken this approach with family before and it\u2019s far easier.", "Wait, you had some sort of neurological surgery, and they are pissed you didn't show up?  Was there no concern from your mom that you were operated on and in the hospital?  I think you're asking the wrong question here.  Of course you are NTA for not taking pictures.  I would be far more upset that no one apparently cared about your health.", "NTA\n\nGeez, are you alright?", "NTA, and what is wrong with your family?! \n\nWas there some emotional significance in this for you, or were they literally just trying to get free labor for a wedding photography package (I hope you would have either walked away or held those photos hostage)? And no one in the family had the morals to let you know for MONTHS? How was it a \"surprise\" birthday party if she was throwing it for herself and planning it for months? You needed emergency surgery, and their first response is being upset that you weren't going to be there?  \n\nHonestly, this would be shitty behavior to a stranger, much less to a family member. Photoshop some clown makeup on your family portraits, because that's all they are.", "NTA at all. They didn\u2019t tell you about the wedding so you would be pressured into taking pictures for free the whole time instead of enjoying yourself. So sorry that none of them care about the fact you were going into surgery! Hope you are doing better!", "NTA. I don't even know what I read here. She never invites you over, doesn't even tell you she's getting married, even your mom lies to you about it. Then you end up having emergency service and then your mom dares to be mad? She should be insanely worried.\n\nThese people tried to trick you into doing free photography for your sisters wedding. You sure these people are family?", "Holy smokes, NTA.\n\nFirst of all, regardless of how you ended up in the hospital, your family should be concerned for your health. I can think of one particular reason that your family would be out of sorts for you ending up in the hospital, but that still doesn't mean they should neglect concern for you. \n\nSecond, why do they think it's okay to rope you into being a free wedding photographer? At the very least, you may not have all the proper tools (I'm sorry, but I'm just not familiar enough with all the tools used in professional photography, so I can't provide examples) required to deliver the quality you'd want for them or that would be expected. \n\nThere is SO much to process in this story.\n\nIt won't change my verdict, but I'd be remiss to not ask for more INFO:\n1) Why is it a surprise birthday party? I'm not calling you, specifically, out on this, but why is that such an insistent descriptor for her when it isn't a) a surprise, and b) a surprise to HER (she's planning it). It being planned for months only seems off because she's part of the process. \n2) Why does the wedding have to be a surprise for you? And no one else? Nothing about this makes sense.\n\nLike, the only possible situation where family members act quite so cagey around one member in particular is when that one person has an addiction and is not yet trying to address it. Even then, the way they treat you doesn't add up to that being the case, and this whole situation makes no sense whatsoever. \n\nGet some rest and recover. You've every right to be upset with them, but definitely brush off their reaction. Their only concern should be for your health, not being butthurt because you getting hurt stopped them from manipulating you.", "NTA  \n\n\nYou had emergency surgery...yet your mum was pissed because you couldn't be at the wedding you didn't know about. F that. Your mum is TA.  \n\n\nThey tried to freeload a wedding shoot. Your sister has never invited you to her house, but did so when she needed to mooch. Your sister is also TA.  \n\n\nDid anyone get concerned? Have they bothered to help you after your surgery? Think about ignoring them for a while, and concentrate on getting better.", "NTA. You had emergency neurosurgery and all you family cares about is a surprise wedding which apparently everyone but you knew about. What a bunch of jerks, I\u2019m sorry you have to call these people family OP.", "FAFO. Nta", "This is just all around weird. NTA but I am confused. Who does that?", "If you missed the \u201csurprise party\u201d for any reason you\u2019re NTA. Add the health scare in there and it\u2019s not even a question. Your family\u2019s super weird and those are not normal reactions. Hope you\u2019re recovered and on the mend OP.", "Nta at all.  Even if you didn't have surgery and you walked into the house and discovered they tricked you, you still would not be the asshole.", "NTA. You have abusive family members.", "NTA OMG I\u2019d be FURIOUS. So you\u2019re at the hospital they are pissed you can\u2019t make it? Why the hell would they lie to you? That would hurt me very deeply and after that I wouldn\u2019t want to talk to them unless they fucking begged. Something very wrong with them.", "NTA. If they wanted a photographer for their wedding they should have hired one.", "a. surprise. wedding.\nThis sounds like a bad idea, just from the getgo. Blaming you for a medical emergency... that begs the question as to just what you are to these people. Surprise, you're our wedding photographer!\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your family is though.", "NTA. Don't see hope you're ok. From here on out I'd forget my camera at home every family get together.", "You were in the hospital and they were trying to scam you into taking her wedding photos for free. \n\nEither one of those would make you NTA \n\nTogether, well, mom and sister have warned you to never bring your cameras and equipment with you to any family events ever again.", "NTA. Did they even care you had to go to the ER?", "Are you okay?", "INFO: So EVERYBODY knew it was actually your sisters wedding - not birthday - and they didn\u2019t tell *you specifically* because they wanted it to be a surprise?\u2026 for you? What???", "NTA. wow your family is messed up. Your mom was more upset over loss of a free photographer than the health of her child. I'm so sorry and I hope you get well soon.", "Nta", "NTA\n\nWhat? Your family is bizzare. \nWhy would they have the obviously planned wedding be a suprise to you only?  Why would they get mad that you were missing it when you are literally in the hospital having emergency surgery?", "So much to unpack here:\n\n1. They nag you into providing photography services for free for the \u2018birthday party\u2019\n\n2. Instead of being concerned that you\u2019re undergoing life threatening surgery her reaction to being told you can\u2019t make it is to be angry rather than concerned. \n\n3. She still attends the wedding instead of being at your bedside. \n\n4. They know this was a shitty deceptive thing to do because literally everyone knew this was a wedding except you. \n\n5. I would imagine doing photography for a full on wedding requires planning, certain equipment etc rather than a few casual birthday shots. So they were expecting you to pull off no doubt professional quality work with no notice, no payment and no gratitude. \n\nWhy do you bother with these people you call your family? I mean if they gave a shit about you none of this would have happened. NTA", "SURPRISE! We need you to work and call it a surprise! \n\nNTA, cut them all off.", "Your mother is a piece of work\n\nYou are not the asshole", "NTA\n\nWhat the hell is going on here?!? \n\nFirst, who throws their own surprise party? That makes no sense! Who's getting surprised? The guests at how vain you are?!?\n\nSecond, only because its in the order you mention it as this is more important! Where was your family when you went into hospital? Did anyone care you had to have emergency surgery? \n\nAnd now third because I'm a retired wedding photographer. Who the hell thinks they can make up an elaborate scheme to get free wedding photos? My rule was if I was a guest at a wedding, the camera stayed home, I want to enjoy the wedding, not work it. Family should never be expected to photograph a wedding, it's a lot of work and you get no downtime to enjoy any of it.", "NTA\n\nIt was a surprise ambush to get free photos. This has nothing to do with recognizing you as a family member or human being.", "NTA\n\nExcuse me, WTF?  They decided you were supposed to be the photographer for a wedding without telling you?  Absolutely not.  Professional photographers get paid big bucks for doing weddings.  They sign contracts. If something happens and they have an emergency, they send a colleague and make sure the event is covered.  \n\nYour mother and sister tried to get free wedding photos and they lost.  They fact they were upset with you not being there to take photos when you were having a medical emergency says it all.  They were being cheap AHs.", "Whoa! This wasn't a surprise, this was a trick. They were trying to get you to photograph her wedding for free. That's a real AH move on your family's behalf. Not only that, they didn't seem to care that you were in surgery. \n\nInfo: Did something happen between you and your family? Is sister the Golden Child? Have they always been toxic?", ">  throwing herself a surprise birthday party and she talked about it for months.\n\nAlso, what did I just read here? How does someone get surprised by something that they a) planned themselves and b) talked about for months?", "Yeah this was so messed up I was speechless. NTA", "Never been invited to sisters house even though they're close. Also Hella messed up", "Um, you can now be part of my family.  We take care of each other, and there's no way I wouldn't have rushed to my sisters bedside if she was being taken into surgery.  Hell no.", "Right? Like, my Mom would attend the wedding and I would expect her to but as soon as it was done she would be at the hospital. And I'm a full on adult.", "They treated OP way worse than a vendor! And it's mind boggling that they didn't just ask for photog services as a gift.", "I'm stuck on the sister \"throwing ***herself*** a ***surprise*** birthday party.\"  How is it a surprise?  If she's literally the one planning it?  Isn't it just a birthday party?  I'm so lost.  \n\nAlso, who has a professional photographer at a birthday party?", "This! \n\nNTA OP and I hope you are doing okay!", "JFC should be an official ruling because sometimes I *think* I have life problems but then I see a post like this and I just need to take a minute.", "RIGHT?  OP, your mother and sister DGAF about you.", "Honestly, I can't decide whether it's too strange to be true or too fucked up for someone to invent.", "If you are the photographer you aren\u2019t in the pictures. I think it\u2019s important that OP didn\u2019t even know where their sister lives. \n\nThat family is a mess. \n\nnta", "The word \u201csurprise\u201d was used so they could lie to themselves about how they\u2019re completely manipulating and taking advantage of OP. Or trying to anyway. If it wasn\u2019t emergency surgery, I\u2019d say it was awesome that OP ended up with a valid excuse to miss the wedding so sis was dealt the karma she deserved.", "Lol, this is what I've been trying to figure out!  How do you send out invites to a party that is supposed to be a surprise for yourself?!  I would think OP meant sister was throwing a regular bday party that turned into a surprise wedding except they called it a surprise bday party for herself a couple of times.", "Who plans their own surprise party? I thought this was the first hint at the weirdness.", "The only person I know who went to the ER and ended up with emergency neurosurgery had a brain tumor (we were playing soccer and his arm went all numb which we thought was an arm injury but it turned out he'd jostled the tumor and it was pressing on a part of his brain).  He ended up fine but he absolutely wasn't out the next day.", "what does jfc mean?", " But it's crazy that it seemed like this was her only purpose to be invited. OP had better company in the emergency than being on that party.", "Oof, and that's why it was a surprise she wasn't ever meant to be there as a guest, hence no invite. Nta Ops family suck", "Could also be a chiari malformation decompression. Type 1s often go undetected in people until they become acute. Presents with sudden balance and coordination issues, vertigo, nausea, headaches, etc. Emergency surgery is required to decompress the affected part of the brain.\n\nRegardless of diagnosis, emergency neurosurgery isn't an elective surgery or something done on a whim. It's very serious and it's very telling that OP's family didn't even ask about their health before jumping on them for not showing up.", "Jesus fucking Christ", "Jesus effing christ", "We all know who the golden child is.", "I honestly think brain surgery trumps a wedding...\n\nHoly cow not even a ounce of concern for op who litterly had brain surgery...\n\nOnly bad words and scolding because she physically could not be there to be the free help!!!\n\nOp didn't even know it was a wedding, they would most likely not even have been dressed properly and what if last minute decided to pull out...\n\nYou cannot be mad at someone for letting you down when they weren't even aware that they had a responsibility in the first place.\n\nI would honestly send a group message along the lines of...\n\nThank you all for the overwhelming concern and well wishes following my brain surgery... I however feel so ashamed that i could not attend the day due to the fact that I had to undergo emergency surgery, again I thank you all for the overwhelming amount of support and care I have received in the wake of this, if I had know that I was expected to be a wedding photographer instead of a guest I would not have gone to the er with my symptoms. I understand and appreciate all the effort all of you have gone trough to keep this information from me, I was truly surprised so many of you were upset at the fact that I couldn't attend, again brain surgery and all... You have done such a fantastic job of keeping this secret a suprize that I didn't think it was a big deal to attend my surgery instead of doing a full day's work without any notice or time to prepare.\n\nR/heavy sarcasm...", "Maybe an aneurysm?\n\nEmergency brain surgery is a big deal.  My Dad had brain surgery when I was a kid and they carefully planned it for months beforehand.  That's what they generally like to do.  It someone's going in right away, there's an imminent problem.", "I mean \u201cpitching in\u201d as photog for a wedding essentially means you\u2019re not participating as guest, unless this is a low-key family reunion / occasion during which you happen to get married, you spend the entire day working.\n\nI\u2019d be about as happy getting volunteered (unbeknownst to me) for photos as I\u2019d be for catering, which is \u201cnot at all\u201d.", "You're better of getting everyone to take pics on their phones.
