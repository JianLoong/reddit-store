You're doing your MIL a favor by being up front about a perfectly fair answer.\n\nYour husband seems to want to avoid conflict with his mother by smoothing things over.

That she would expect you to spend precious parental time off doing this (when you already see her 2x a week) speaks of self-centeredness.

I can see that MIL is a handful, and it seems like your husband is used to deflecting her and saying \"no\" later.  You were being direct and there's nothing wrong with that.  All he needed to say was \"sorry, we have plans\".  That should be his automatic response with his mom.  If you already see her 2-3x a week then no, there's no reason to sacrifice your date night.
