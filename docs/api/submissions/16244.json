We have a pretty big house, so we host most family gatherings. It recently came out that our granddaughter and some of her friends were tormenting this girl at her school for no particular reason. \n\nThey were harassing her in person and online, and I guess it got pretty serious. My daughter and son in-law pulled her out of that school, and she isn't getting any electronics until she's 18 and can buy them herself. I agree with how they've been handling this, but as for my wife and I, we don't plan on letting this slide.\n\nWe both got bullied for stupid reasons as kids as well (I have glasses and she was \"ugly\") I lost friends to bullying and I undertstand how serious that is. So when Easter was coming around I told my daughter not to bring the oldest, as she's no longer welcome in our home or our lives, and we don't consider her our granddaughter anymore\n\nThe way we see it, anything less would be a statement that we condone bullying, and are alright being friendly with bullies. I understand why my daughter can't do that, it's her child and she's a minor, but we won't tolerate that. My daughter told me none of them are coming, and even called my sister and brother in-law, the latter of whom didn't come with his family either. Now the entire thing hqs split the family, and we're worried we might've gone too far.", "created_utc": 1683067579, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1362w4t/aita_for_not_allowing_our_granddaughter_in_my/", "score": 78, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

YTA, of course you've gone too far. Her parents already punished her as they were supposed to. All you're doing is punishing the rest of her family by making them choose between you and their daughter/niece. \n\nShe's a kid who has to learn her lesson. Your role as a grandparent is to explain to her why what she did was wrong.

Think back to the bullies you encountered in your life\u2026 chances are, they were struggling with something. Chances are, they needed help and mentoring. It is clear that they all deserve a chance at redemption. You can\u2019t just discard someone who made a mistake. That is more cruel than the actions you seem so passionate in preventing. \n\nWhile she certainly needs accountability, she also needs help.

Wow.", "Soft YTA. I do get where you are but completely eliminating her from your life won't do a bit of good. Be a positive force in her life. I mean, why is she bullying? She clearly needs some kind of therapy. What's going on in her family that helped her learn how to do this awful kind of behavior? Banning her won't help her, and she is your granddaughter.

I mean, you're not gonna have a single person in your life who is welcomed at your home. She's already receiving punishment - as she should - maybe she can change in the future; I know I did a ton of stupid shit when I was younger, eventually I grew up. (Most people do.)\n\nThe punishment doesn't fit the crime here. If you were giving her some money when she came to visit before, maybe you can tell her you won't be doing that anymore because of her actions. Maybe tell her that you won't be buying her a Christmas present this year because of it. But forbidding her from entering your home anymore is just.. extreme.", "YTA\n\nThis is insanely over the top. Teenagers can be cruel monsters, but they should be taught and punished not shunned.  The fact that you state you don't consider her your granddaughter anymore is bizarre.", "YTA. \n\nYou\u2019re basically bullying someone (your granddaughter) as punishment for being a bully. \n\nShe\u2019s 17. She can still grow up. You\u2019re a grown adult and you\u2019re an asshole.", "You took this too far. I agree with your stance on bullying, and appreciate that you\u2019re trying to teach her a lesson on its severity. It affected you personally, and I see where you\u2019re coming from. But outright disowning your granddaughter? At 17? She has many lessons to learn still. \n\nThey may forgive, but they won\u2019t forget and your relationship with your entire family will not be the same. Just sit down and talk to them. Explain why this hurt you so much but understand that you hurt them too. \n\nYWBTA if you kept at this.", "YTA, your daughter and son in-law have disciplined their child. It's not your place to punish your granddaughter, as well. You have definitely gone too far. You're not only fair weather grandparents, but you stomped all over your daughter and son in-law as parents, as well. Don't be surprised if you never see a grandchild ever again.", "Oh jeez. YTA. \nPeople can make mistakes and learn from them. The parents are parenting. Your job is to support them, and to support your grandchild to be better. \nCurrently you\u2019re bullying her for a mistake. You can make your message clear without disowning her entirely. The emotional damage that would do is awful. You\u2019re bullies yourselves!\n\nPunishments should be proportionate! A learning experience. \n\nApologise to your daughter. Hope she didn\u2019t tell the granddaughter and work on being better parents and grandparents and do not be bullied to your own family!!!", "YTA.  When you lose hope that people can change then the world is lost.  \n\nShe is 17 - she still has time to grow up.  This is a chance to tell her how this kind of behaviour affected you - people (I assume) she loves.  It also isn't clear if she was the ringleader or a follower.  If the latter, there is a greater chance you can help get her on the right path.  There is never 'no reason'.  Its always something within the person doing the bullying - try and find out what it is instead of writing the kid off.", "YTA. It sounds like justice was already served. Why do you feel it's your place to keep punishing her?", "Often when kids bully there is an underlying cause to the behaviour.\n\nIt sounds like to me you've just took years of repressed feelings against your own bully out on her rather than trying to get to the route cause.\n\n\nYour daughter is handling the situation and you've way overstepped the mark here.\n\nYTA.", "YTA.  This is your granddaughter.  How is she supposed to learn compassion if she's not shown any?  This isn't giving her a chance to learn to do better, it's punishment coming from a place of resentment and unresolved baggage.   You can let her know you disapprove of her actions without excommunicating her entirely.", "Overkill... YTA.\n\nI'm not sure that your granddaughter is the only bully in the family.", "Rather than disown your granddaughter, why not take the time and tell her plainly your experiences with bullying. Explain the lifelong trauma, the damage to your self esteem and mental health.", "YTA. You stepped in the middle of your daughter and son-in-law's parenting and said, by implication, that they weren't doing enough. Did you not think you might lose your family over this? Your trauma blinded you to the probable outcome of your actions. Only you can hope to repair this. Apologize to your granddaughter and explain why you overreacted as you did. Maybe it can turn into a learning experience for all of you.", "YTA.  Her parents have disciplined her.  You are seeking revenge for something that happened decades ago.  You could have used your experiences as a teaching moment,  instead you are acting as immaturely as she is.  BTW I was bullied for years in school.", "ESH yeah, straight to disowning your minor granddaughter is going too far depending on the severity of the bullying - it would have maybe been better to ask your daughter if you could have a family meeting to discuss the bullying issue (to actually get clarification on how far things went), maybe discuss what might have lead to it happening (yeah, she could just be an asshole but bullies often learn it) or just focus on identify your own experience and then layout your disappointment and that you don\u2019t tolerate or condone bullying and if it continues/happen again you\u2019ll cut her off. But nope, you went straight to bloodbath. \n\nI like how you take no responsibility/self-reflection for your granddaughter being a bully when you very well could be a factor, make no effort to actually constructively approach the matter (ex family meeting), seem to have even waited a while after the fact before doling out your punishment, one that very explicitly oversteps your daughter\u2019s parenting to do so and takes no consideration to the family fallout that would likely happen in doing so (doesn\u2019t take a lot to figure that the rest of the family would not appreciate your \u2018no tolerance\u2019 disownment policy for a minor\u2019 and would respond in kind). \n\nMight want to look in the mirror long and hard about your behaviour, because I can easily see why your granddaughter is a bully just from reading your words on your perspective of the situation.  Your granddaughter is at least a minor, what\u2019s your excuse for you and your wife?", "YTA I like that you want her punished and to learn her mistake but you exaggerate. You went too far.", "YTA you are not deciding who comes to your home, you are deciding who gets excluded from family gathering, which in this case, is a child. You're basically bullying her.", "Sadly, if you don't change your stance, then yes, YTA here.  Work on some kind of bridge, some kind of way for the granddaughter to redeem herself.\n\nBeing true to yourselves requires you take strong action.  Making it a complete break isn't the right action as far as I can see.\n\nI suggest trying to help her find some way back into constructive behaviour.  Sports?  Social work?  Helping disadvantaged people somehow?", "YTA. It would be one thing if her parents weren\u2019t parenting and were taking the situation lightly. But you are taking what happened to you and taking it out on your granddaughter. There\u2019s obviously an internal reason that she treated this girl the way she did. I don\u2019t think exiling her from the family is going to solve the issue, it\u2019s just going exacerbate it.", "YTA.\n\nYour daughter has done plenty as punishment by pulling her out of the school (and therefore out of that friend group) and away from all electronics. Honestly, no electronics for that age group is a very harsh but appropriate punishment. You don\u2019t get to punish her, that\u2019s not your place. And disowning her does nothing to teach her anything and just alienates her. What you should be doing is reaching out and talking to her about your own experiences with bullies and how damaging it can be. Letting her talk to you about what she did and why. Grandparents can be a great soundboard as they\u2019re not in the place to punish, just listen and love. You could be using your story to teach her the compassion she\u2019s clearly lacking. Instead you\u2019re just bullying her yourselves.", "Yta. I feel you did go too far. It\u2019s okay standing behind your no bullying policy but there is a learning opportunity for your granddaughter. You could have taken her aside and describe your experience in hopes to inspire her to be a better person. Let her know how bullying can emotionally scar a person for life, as in your case and the reason you acted so harshly . (It isn\u2019t too late for this lesson!) Cutting her out of your life is very extreme, especially at the age of 17 when teens deal with peer pressure and are known to make horrible mistakes and are immature. MOST people grow up and leave bad behavior behind.  I say go talk to her, and move past this.", "YTA for going too far by declaring she\u2019s not your granddaughter anymore.\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t be one though over the visiting ban. That\u2019s fair enough she has consequences for her shitty actions.\n\nHowever as a grandparent this is your opportunity to investigate why she\u2019s a bully, while there\u2019s no excuse for that behavior maybe just maybe she needs a safe person to unload what is causing her to lash out. She needs counseling not dramatic \u2018you\u2019re not our granddaughter straight up\u2019. \n\n\nOnly disown her if she continues to be a bully. But if you wanted to stop others from becoming her victim, this is the worst way to go.\n\nI suggest you seek therapy yourselves for your experiences and then guidance on repairing this relationship including being open with your granddaughter why you have reacted this way.", "YTA. You have absolutely gone too far. As you said, your daughter and son-in-law are handling it. What you're doing will just alienate your granddaughter. Keeping her in your life doesn't mean you're condoning bullying. It's not like having an unrepentant racist over for dinner. In fact, given your experience, you could talk to her about the seriousness of bullying and teach her to do better.", "YTA. I get the child messed up but don't disown her. She's still a kid and kids are mean. If you just said you didn't want her at this one gathering I'd understand, but to turn your back on her completely is just not something I can support. I do hate bullying and hope the victim is getting all the help they need, but don't disown your granddaughter when she already has a very suitable punishment. I understand your trauma too, but you're still taking it too far imo.", "YTA. Definitely went too far. \"We were bullied and ostracised as children, so we're now ostracising our granddaughter.\" I get the message that you're trying to out across is that you don't condone bullying, but you're really just bullying her in return.\n\nIt's also her parents job to punish her, not yours. If you feel you can guide them at all, then offer your opinion, but it's not your place to punish her. You're exercising a grindiose view of yourself where you're the most impartant part of this, whereas you're really a few times removed from it.", "YTA. Geezus.", "Yta bigtime.\n\n1. Its not your place to punish your granddaughter. A better approach is to tell her what you and grandma went thru because of bullying. \n\n2. You say you split the family. No, you separated yourself from the family. No one is on your side.\n\n3. Apolgize to everyone or you will live a lonely life.", "YTA. I was an idiot at 17, no matter how book smart I might have been. Find me anyone who can truthfully say otherwise.", "YTA there\u2019s no come back from this for her in your eyes. She\u2019s already been punished by her parents and rather then telling her you\u2019re disappointed by her behaviour you\u2019ve told her she\u2019s dead to you. Of course your daughter isn\u2019t coming to yours anymore, you\u2019ve told her her child is irredeemable.", "YTA and this post reeks of virtue signaling.", "YTA.  Children are exactly that - kids, with not fully developed brains. Children need love and guidance. All children test boundaries, and while I realize this hits a pain point personally for the two of you, your response was not only way over-the-top, but downright unhealthy and inappropriate.  Many thoughts here:  1. Trust your daughter as a parent, and let her do her job as a parent.  After all, you are still parents to your daughter and as such, should be supportive in helping your daughter teach and guide your granddaughter to make better decisions. You\u2019ve essentially given your daughter twice the stress and doubled her problems. Now, not only does she have to deal with her daughter\u2019s issues, but now also coach her own daughter, your granddaughter through feelings of extreme pain, rejection, humiliation and shame (from you, because you\u2019ve banned her from your lives).    Do you have any idea what kind of pain you\u2019ve just caused your already hurting granddaughter!?! Shes a child! She made a mistake, or many mistakes. She is learning.  She needs love.  But what you\u2019ve just taught her is that any mistakes she makes will mean abandonment from those she loves. You\u2019ve just taught your granddaughter that your love in conditional.    You\u2019ve just taught your granddaughter that mistakes=rejection and she will likely now hide any mistakes she makes from here on out\u2014 and trust me there will be many.  Bullying is awful, but there are a million faults and flaws and stumbles that kids make as they grow. You\u2019ve just made a huge mountain out of a molehill and ruined any semblance of trust with not only your granddaughter, but your daughter as well.  I hope you two see the error of your ways.  Your behavior here is toxic and downright spiteful\u2026. Kind of like bullying.   I wouldn\u2019t blame your daughter for keeping up a very very strict wall up around you both for the rest of her life \u2014- in fact she should. YTA!!", "YTA. You did your family a favor,as they can see who you both really are. Everyone is better off without you two, especially the granddaughter. Bravo on the parents on being responsible and teaching discipline to her, which is their duty, not yours. I can't even imagine what goes through your heads to think this was a valid response to the situation. \"Something is bad? Well, why don't we make it worse for everyone?\"", "YTA. She\u2019s a child that made a mistake, she doesn\u2019t need her grandparents to disown her. This is just terrible of you both and you should be ashamed of yourself", "YTA. You went way to far.  People do make mistakes and it doesn't help to grind them into the ground.  In this case you became bullies yourselves going after a girl who can not respond", "Yeah, I think YTA because if you really want your granddaughter to learn from all this you should talk to her about your experiences. If she doubles down at that point then feel free to go NC, but until then you could be the best source for her to learn from.", "YTA!  The girls parents are already disciplining her but you decide to double down and essentially disown her\u2026.a 17 year old.  Good luck ever seeing any of your grandchildren again because you seem mean and vengeful.  You were in a position to tell your granddaughter how damaging bullying can be because you experienced it first hand.  Instead, you chose to make it about you.", "YTA. Should you condone bullying? No. But should you banish your 17 YEAR OLD *GRANDCHILD* from the family? No because that doesn't teach her anything either, especially when 17 year olds generally have a lot of growing up and learning about life still to do and how do you expect her to learn the compassion and empathy she is clearly struggling with if her family won't even show it to her? Sure if she was 23 and this had been an on going issue since she was 17, I would understand...but you jumped the gun here. \n\nAlso I'm not saying she shouldn't know better, she should and she probably does. But sometimes people, especially teenagers, can get lost and caught up in stuff/people and end up doing things that they regret.", "YTA. She's young and has some growing up to do. She's already been punished for what she did. What kind of grandparents are you to basically disown her for a mistake that she's already being punished for??? You wonder if you might have gone too far? Well let this grandmother make it clear: You absolutely went too far!!! YTA YTA YTA", "YTA Not welcome on your home anymore? Don't consider her your granddaughter anymore? Talk about taking it too far. Your daughter and SIL already handled the situation and gave her her consequences. You should have left it at that.", "NAH I guess. I dunno. It\u2019s not how I\u2019d have handled it.", "NTA but with a caveat, if she realises the error of her ways and makes amends, you should be willing to forgive her. I would hate to be judged on my stupid actions as a 17 year old and I'm sure in time she will feel the same.", "I wanna go NTA but I think ESH fits best, you are completely within your right to take the stance you have but at the age she is you could explain to her what you both went through in regards to bullying etc and that might actually get through to her \ud83e\udd37", "I think that this is challenging because you and your wife have been victims of bullying, and you know the damage it can do. But on the other hand, she's young and obviously has a lot of growing to do.\n\nGiven the info given here, she was definitely going above and beyond in making this other girl's life hell. The fact that she thought doing that was acceptable says a lot about her, and none of it is good. Hopefully this stems more from her peer group rather than how she's being parented.\n\nI'm going to say NTA here, but you might want to reconsider completely shutting her out. I don't know how often you talked to her about how you'd been treated growing up, and your own experience with bullying. If you haven't, it might be worth talking to her about it when you're ready. It may click for her if it's not some girl from school, but people who had a hand in raising her.", "YTA bc your GDs brain is still developing and puts reward over consequences and will until she's in her mid 20s.

It's your house and your rules, you just have to be prepared for those consequences that might come with that. For your decision, no I don't think you are the asshole, but I can't say that your daughter or her siblings are assholes either for how they responded. Bullying is a serious thing that should be taken seriously, but you can't control how other people are going to react to what you do.\n\nFor disowning her as a granddaughter, YTA. That's going way too far.", "NTA. It was a choice to continuously harass that girl online and in real life. Actions have consequences and this is a good time to learn that lesson.

We have a pretty big house, so we host most family gatherings. It recently came out that our granddaughter and some of her friends were tormenting this girl at her school for no particular reason. \n\nThey were harassing her in person and online, and I guess it got pretty serious. My daughter and son in-law pulled her out of that school, and she isn't getting any electronics until she's 18 and can buy them herself. I agree with how they've been handling this, but as for my wife and I, we don't plan on letting this slide.\n\nWe both got bullied for stupid reasons as kids as well (I have glasses and she was \"ugly\") I lost friends to bullying and I undertstand how serious that is. So when Easter was coming around I told my daughter not to bring the oldest, as she's no longer welcome in our home or our lives, and we don't consider her our granddaughter anymore\n\nThe way we see it, anything less would be a statement that we condone bullying, and are alright being friendly with bullies. I understand why my daughter can't do that, it's her child and she's a minor, but we won't tolerate that. My daughter told me none of them are coming, and even called my sister and brother in-law, the latter of whom didn't come with his family either.

But you need to directly communicate that with her, not through her parent, and share how those harmful actions have such lasting effects on others so she can actually understand.

You are putting your daughter in a situation of needing to chose between her own daughter or you.  Of course her daughter is going to win.", "YTA. I was thrown out by an uncle for a careless mistake. My apology was dismissed as pointless subjectivism. It has been over 40 years. I have never for\nGotten, even though I knew he had a mean streak. I hope you\u2019re happy.", "YTA\n\nI do hope you realise that you're basically bullying your granddaughter, which at best makes you malicious hypocrites.", "YTA. This is not your problem to parent. Let her parents decide her punishment and you just be grandparents. Additionally banishment from your home is not an equal reaction to her bullying someone. This really has nothing to do with you. They way you could best help is by talking to her and explain Im how bullying hurt you. What you're doing is too far and not your place.", "YTA and now you're a bully too.", "Of course you went too far!  Your granddaughter made a huge mistake and is now facing the consequences of bullying.  Completely disowning her doesn't make any sense.  Wouldn't you want to have a conversation with your granddaughter about how badly you were affected by bullying, and how you're disappointed that she is going down the wrong path?  She did wrong but there is time for her to learn from her mistakes and be better.  YTA", "YTA. How dare you even ask this question. Go to therapy to talk about your issues being bullied as a kid. Currently you\u2019re a bully.", "YTA and are showing the maturity of a 17 yo.\n\nYou\u2019re disowning a 17 year old kid with no way for retribution, for something that doesn\u2019t even involve you.\n\nNot going to lie, I\u2019m not surprised the kid is bullying based on the way their own family treats them.", "YTA. I fully understand your feelings on bullying and being horrified by your granddaughter\u2019s behavior. But disowning her, a 17 year old, is not the acceptable way to deal with it. You should sit her down and tell her you & your wife\u2019s experience being bullied, how awful it felt, & explain that you\u2019re incredibly disappointed in her. Cutting her off is not the answer.", "YTA.\n\nIt would be one thing if your eldest granddaughter took it upon herself to be a bully to everyone under your roof but that didn\u2019t happen. Instead, you *briefly* heard of the bullying and the punishment and decided to chip in by *disowning her*. That\u2019s not effective discipline and it\u2019s not even discipline you need to implement when you\u2019re not the one affected by her harmful actions.\n\nBullying sucks. I was teased here and there but not enough to warrant me questioning my entire existence like some kids. What your daughter and son in-law had in place for your granddaughter\u2019s punishment was enough. All you had to do was follow their rules of punishment which was simple: no electronics for her and allow her to buy them herself.", "YTA... holy shit, you guys suck. Using your granddaughter as revenge for treatment you received as a kid is fucking horrible. I'm not sure which side is served best by this arrangement.", "YTA. Your punishment for her bullying is to bully her yourself.", "Yeah, that's my thought too. Keeping the granddaughter out till she shows improvement and hopefully remorse and tries to make amends to the victim, I understand and might consider if I were in the same situation as OP. An unconditional \"we don't consider her our granddaughter anymore\" is an AH move though.\n\nSince the granddaughter also behaved terribly, I'd say ESH in this case.", "I'm not sure on the second point. No to the first and yes to the last two.", "This is the part where you should be talking with your granddaughter to help her understand why she was engaging in those behaviors. Becuase if it was the bad influence of friends I assure you being rejected by family is not going to help with that.", "Me too and I agree with you. They obviously don't like this girl and this is their excuse", "I don't consider this kind of behavior redeemable. And I doubt her parents will reward her with sports.", "WOW!  Are you condoning his granddaughter's bullying or your own?\nGrandparents are right\u2026Kid needs to know that actions have consequences", "this is the realist response I've ever seen.", "> anything less would be a statement that we condone bullying\n\nOP\u2019s current statement is remorse and redemption are impossible because one strike and you are ~~out~~ banished", "She apologized, and her parents are taking this very seriously and punishing her. YTA for your over-the-top overreaction and taking out your anger at your high school bully on your granddaughter. You should be ashamed.", "What was the bullying related to... race, sexuality, promiscuity, being nerdy, looks, socioeconomic status, plain old being mean?", "Honestly, your reaction to her misbehavior is so extreme that I think she may have learned the unrelenting, unloving behavior from\u2026you.\n\nA child is not irredeemable; their brains aren\u2019t even fully formed until age 25. If you believe a person can\u2019t grow beyond the mistakes of their childhood, then you have a stunted view of humanity and probably lack empathy for others. Maybe you even lacked growth yourself - are you the same person you were at 17?\n\nI\u2019m sorry you were bullied, but bullying someone back is not the answer. Showing her the right way to behave, loving her despite her faults, and sharing your experience is.", "That's incredibly harsh. You must not have cared for her much to begin with.", "Bruh, a 17 year old has an average of 8 more years of brain development. Her brain isn't even fully matured and you think she is irredeemable for the rest of her life??? Even if she sees the error of her ways, makes amends and this incidident was the only lesson she ever needed to set her straight? That's honestly kind of disgusting of you. I think you and your wife need to look into therapy yourselves for your trauma because obviously y'all are still very much not healed and projecting it onto your granddaughter who needs her family to guide her right now, not abandon her.", "My view is that 17, honestly, everybody is redeemable, somehow.\n\nYou don't say how the granddaughter is reacting, whether she's in any way remorseful.  Obviously that's really important to the how, the when, and the what speed about bringing her back into social things.\n\nSport is a good way to build team feelings and bonding with others.  Certainly has to be chosen carefully.  I was puzzled by your use of \"reward her\".  In any case I was thinking of things I've seen help young people develop.\n\nI entirely agree it's extremely difficult.  But it sounds like you've given up on her: you know her, and we don't.  But from what you've said, it sounds like you've gone too far.", "If you are unwilling to forgive and be there for her\u2026 She is better off without you.", "Of course she is redeemable, she is 17. \n\nDo you background check every person you know to ensure they have never bullied anyone? \n\nIt sounds like you are not willing to accept the consequences of your actions. You now will not have a relationship with any of your grandchildren because you decided disowning one was the way to go and have decided she cannot be forgiven.", "You must be perfect in every way if you don't find things redeemable", "\u2026you think a 17 year old bullying someone isn\u2019t redeemable? What a sad way to look at the world.", "So, in your opinion, a 17 year old minor's behavior is irredeemable. Do you really mean forever? She can never redeem herself? You do realize that having a child become a bully is a reflection on bad parenting, right?", "Well, heck, why don\u2019t you just shoot her? You\u2019ve pretty much implied she doesn\u2019t deserve to live. \n\nWho\u2019s the irredeemable bully?!! Hint, it\u2019s not the child.", "So, instead of sitting down with her & explaining as victims of bullying what her behavior could have caused teaching her a valuable lesson, you just decided that she's unlovable & doesn't exist now? Do you not see that you're bullying her in a way by turning your backs on her instead of trying to help her change? She *can* change whether you want to believe it or not. \n\nYTA because you have convinced yourselves that she's *your* bullies & can't be redeemed. That's unfair & untrue, which you should know at your age. *Anyone* whose a bully can change if they want to. By you turning your backs on her, you're telling her it's no use trying to change for the better because the people you love won't believe it instead of encouraging her to be a better person. At the moment she needs you most you have decided to turn your backs on her as if she's repeatedly promised to change & burnt your trust by repeatedly doing the same thing which she hasn't. You have sentenced her to always being the kid she is now without giving her a chance to become the woman she might be if you helped her see what bullying caused the people she loves. \n\nNobody is saying that you have to condone bullying. However, it's a bit harsh & extreme to cut her off now instead of trying to help her see the wrongs of what she did by using your own experiences. She can change if she wants. Please stop pretending that she's can't due to the bullies of your past. That's unfair to her & also you if you keep doing so.", "That makes op just as much of a bully, just one of a different flavor."]}
