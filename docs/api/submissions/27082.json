Because this doesn't sound like a particularly sustainable situation.", "**NTA**  Your daughter is lucky to have a safe landing place to get herself together and work on getting a place of her own.\n\n>My 16-year-old daughter moved into the spare bedroom so we could turn her bedroom (that is bigger and has its own bathroom) into a room for my daughter and grandson to share. \n\nSo...is your daughter thinking that the 16-year old can have her room back, that that the two boys can take over the larger bedroom and she can have a smaller one with no bathroom,  or does she think that the rest of the family should continue to make sacrifices for her?  \n\nI think your wife is wrong.   4 adults + 3 kids living in relative comfort still made for a lot of people living in one house.   Your daughter added one of each and wants to rearrange things for her comfort. That could create a lot of resentment from the others, not just your nephew.  If she doesn't like living in the same room with her son, she should work hard on getting a place of her own.", "NTA.  You already kicked out your 16 year old from her room with an en suite in favor of this daughter and her son\u2026and that\u2019s not enough for her?  Tell her time for a reality check.  Go look at renting or buying somewhere else if none of this is good enough for her..tough shit\u2026.  She\u2019s being given a great gift of housing, and a bunch of built in babysitters.  Don\u2019t let her crap all over the kids.  Her problems can\u2019t become everyone else\u2019s.", "NTA. While it might not be ideal, it's better for your grandson to stay with his mom than his cousin. Between 3 and 8 are fairly significant developmental milestones. Also your grandson has had his world upended. It's better to have the comfort of his mother at the ready. She may need breaks and giving her care respite would be great, but there's no reason that she shouldn't share a room with her child.", "NTA.\n\nYou sound like a kind and generous father. Your adult daughter sounds incredibly entitled: you gave her the bigger room with the bathroom; you decorated it to her taste and added a loft bed for her son!\n\nI suggest you tell her that if she insists on her son moving out of the room, she will have to move into the spare room so your younger daughter can move back into her own room.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter has some massive balls to expect to have her own room and make someone else live with her son. Tell her to stop asking and to get a job and to move out, and then she won't have to share a room anymore.", "NTA and I think you and your nephew have the right of this (he was generous to suggest occasional sleep-overs). Your daughter's change in life circumstance shouldn't mean that she is more important than your adopted nephew. She is an adult and can (eventually) make her own way with her son. Your adopted nephew is your minor child who needs protection and support. He is not less important.\n\nEDIT: keep an eye on your wife's obvious favoritism to your adult daughter.", "NTA. This is your home and more importantly your children\u2019s home. And your nephews. She can go for a walk. If you made your nephew share a room, you might as well tell him he doesn\u2019t matter as much as your real kids. I think it\u2019s very reasonable and really kind that he offered to have a sleepover occasionally.", "NTA when she moved in, she understood the living arrangements. It would be unfair to ask the nephew to share a room when he had not previously done so. While your daughter is going through a rough patch, you and your wife are very generous to let her stay in the spare room with your grandson. I can think of a number of families who would not be so generous.", "NTA. 4+ years is a big age gap for kids. It wouldn't be fair to your nephew to have to give up his space to share with a preschooler.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019ve already moved one minor child to accommodate her. Assuming this is supposed to be temporary, there\u2019s no reason to keep shifting and changing things up for the permanent residents of the house. Especially to make an eight-year-old share a room with a toddler he barely knows.\n\nWishing her all the best with finding a new home and setting up her new life.", "Consider what this is saying to your nephew? If he his an adopted member of the family, would not having a room to himself like the other siblings make him feel like he is not on equal footing?", "Your daughter has a free roof over her head. The appropriate response is thank you.\n\nNTA", "NTA if she doesn't want to share with her son she can move out. Why she doesn't want to share room with her son did he bother her at night time.", "Nta your daughter can take responsibility for her child.", "NTA.\n\nYou're letting her stay there for free with her son.  She's an adult, if she doesn't like it she needs to get a job and her own place.  Her poor life decisions aren't your responsibility and she's being both ungrateful and entitled.", "NTA    your family has gone out if their way to make space for them, and she thinks you should do more? Talk about looking a gift horse in the mouth.\n\nI think your nephew is very generous for offering to let him sleepover sometimes, and that is the only way it should be, sometimes. \n\nThe age difference between your nephew and grandson, while not huge, means that your grandson is going to be getting into everything that belongs to your nephew, and that's not fair (I know life isn't fair, but we have an obligation to make it seem so, for as long as possible).\n\nYes your daughter is going through a hard time, but she has a roof over her head, and food on her plate, she needs to understand that, and show a little gratitude. There are a lot of families who wouldn't have made room for her.", "This may get downvoted, but I say NTA.  It's your house.  You are being nice enough to let her stay there.  She needs to be focused on getting a job and finding her own place to live rather than worrying about having to share a room with HER son.  She's lucky your other daughter was gracious enough to give up her bedroom to them.", "NTA.  Your daughter seems ungrateful for what you are doing for her.  Especially how she continues to bring up moving her son after you have said no to this.  How long does she plan to stay with you all?  Sharing a room with her son will make her want to have this not be forever. She wants the good bedroom with a bath all to herself.  \n\nMaybe ask 16 if she wants to have her old room back, and she would share with nephew.  She may want to just to have a newly decorated room with it\u2019s one bath.  Then sis can have the small guest room.", "NTA.  It was your daughters decision to move back so she was aware that this would be the arrangement.  If she is not happy she is free to move out,", "NTA. I think you've been pretty accomoding for your daughter. Plus, your grands grandson is basically a stranger to your nephew, why would he have to share his space with him ? He lives here full time, your daughter is just sorting her life out. If she can't stand the arrangement she's free to move elsewhere. Plus, if you cave in and make your grandson sleep with your nephew, will she agree to move to the former spare room so that your teenage daughter can get her room back ? What message does it send to your nephew ? Won't he feel treated like less because he's not your son by blood ?\n\nThe current arrangement seems fine by me, and you made everything to make your daughter feel welcome", "NTA. If she\u2019s pressing it, I\u2019d ask if she intends to give her sister, her room back. Or does she expect everyone else to pick up the slack?", "When I split with my ex I moved to my aunties. I shared the room with my son then my son AND daughter (turned out I was pregnant when I left but wasnt going back anyway).\nThere was an empty room but that was NOT my house. \nMy kid my responsibility.\nNTA.\n\nShe was already accommodated by having lil sis give up her big room with a bathroom.\n\nDaughter needs to grow up and be less selfish. This is her child.", "NTA. When my dad left my mum moved us back in with her parents. Small 3 bedroom house, my grandparents had one room, my 2 brothers shared a room, and I shared a room with my mum. Sure, we probably could have jammed another bed in with my brothers, but it wouldn't have been comfortable. My mum sacrificed her own comfort, her own preferences, to try to give us more space. I shared a room with my mum for years. I'm sure it wasn't comfortable for my mum, but it's what we had to do. And it gave my mum incentive to get us out as fast as possible. \n\nYour daughter is having a tough time. I understand she wants the space, and what she asks *seems* reasonable, but it isn't. She has responsibilities. You've opened the doors and let her come home, great because that's what family is for. But she doesn't get to dictate how that help is given or make others (your nephew) sacrifice for her. Don't let her get so comfortable that she forgets you're doing her a *favour*.", "If you force your adopted son to give up his own room to accommodate your daughter then you would definitely be the AH.  It's unfair to make an 8 year old have to work around the schedule of a 3 year old and given what the 3 year old has gone through he should be staying close to his mother.\n\nWould the ensuite room where your oldest is sleep now be big enough for a partition to effectively create two separate private sleeping areas?  If so, and if your nephew agrees your daughter could move into the smaller room and let the two boys have the larger room with the ensuite -- but ONLY if the nephew agrees.", "NTA if this is a short term thing. If she's moving in in more of a permanent basis, then reimagining the rooms would be reasonable as she is an adult.", "NAH - I think mom and son should share the room.  You do want to be supportive as she escapes here relationship.  At the same time, for starters she can share with her boy at least until the dust settles.  If your nephew later wants an interloper in his room, that can be arranged.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
