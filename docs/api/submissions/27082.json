Your daughter added one of each and wants to rearrange things for her comfort. That could create a lot of resentment from the others, not just your nephew.  If she doesn't like living in the same room with her son, she should work hard on getting a place of her own.", "NTA.

While it might not be ideal, it's better for your grandson to stay with his mom than his cousin. Between 3 and 8 are fairly significant developmental milestones.

She may need breaks and giving her care respite would be great, but there's no reason that she shouldn't share a room with her child.", "NTA.\n\nYou sound like a kind and generous father. Your adult daughter sounds incredibly entitled: you gave her the bigger room with the bathroom; you decorated it to her taste and added a loft bed for her son!\n\nI suggest you tell her that if she insists on her son moving out of the room, she will have to move into the spare room so your younger daughter can move back into her own room.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter has some massive balls to expect to have her own room and make someone else live with her son.

There are a lot of families who wouldn't have made room for her.", "This may get downvoted, but I say NTA.  It's your house.  You are being nice enough to let her stay there.  She needs to be focused on getting a job and finding her own place to live rather than worrying about having to share a room with HER son.  She's lucky your other daughter was gracious enough to give up her bedroom to them.", "NTA.  Your daughter seems ungrateful for what you are doing for her.  Especially how she continues to bring up moving her son after you have said no to this.  How long does she plan to stay with you all?  Sharing a room with her son will make her want to have this not be forever. She wants the good bedroom with a bath all to herself.  \n\nMaybe ask 16 if she wants to have her old room back, and she would share with nephew.  She may want to just to have a newly decorated room with it\u2019s one bath.  Then sis can have the small guest room.", "NTA.  It was your daughters decision to move back so she was aware that this would be the arrangement.  If she is not happy she is free to move out,", "NTA. I think you've been pretty accomoding for your daughter. Plus, your grands grandson is basically a stranger to your nephew, why would he have to share his space with him ? He lives here full time, your daughter is just sorting her life out. If she can't stand the arrangement she's free to move elsewhere. Plus, if you cave in and make your grandson sleep with your nephew, will she agree to move to the former spare room so that your teenage daughter can get her room back ? What message does it send to your nephew ? Won't he feel treated like less because he's not your son by blood ?\n\nThe current arrangement seems fine by me, and you made everything to make your daughter feel welcome", "NTA.

This is her child.", "NTA. When my dad left my mum moved us back in with her parents. Small 3 bedroom house, my grandparents had one room, my 2 brothers shared a room, and I shared a room with my mum. Sure, we probably could have jammed another bed in with my brothers, but it wouldn't have been comfortable. My mum sacrificed her own comfort, her own preferences, to try to give us more space. I shared a room with my mum for years. I'm sure it wasn't comfortable for my mum, but it's what we had to do. And it gave my mum incentive to get us out as fast as possible. \n\nYour daughter is having a tough time. I understand she wants the space, and what she asks *seems* reasonable, but it isn't. She has responsibilities. You've opened the doors and let her come home, great because that's what family is for. But she doesn't get to dictate how that help is given or make others (your nephew) sacrifice for her. Don't let her get so comfortable that she forgets you're doing her a *favour*.", "If you force your adopted son to give up his own room to accommodate your daughter then you would definitely be the AH.  It's unfair to make an 8 year old have to work around the schedule of a 3 year old and given what the 3 year old has gone through he should be staying close to his mother.\n\nWould the ensuite room where your oldest is sleep now be big enough for a partition to effectively create two separate private sleeping areas?  If so, and if your nephew agrees your daughter could move into the smaller room and let the two boys have the larger room with the ensuite -- but ONLY if the nephew agrees.", "NTA if this is a short term thing. If she's moving in in more of a permanent basis, then reimagining the rooms would be reasonable as she is an adult.", "NAH - I think mom and son should share the room.  You do want to be supportive as she escapes here relationship.  At the same time, for starters she can share with her boy at least until the dust settles.

Honestly if the adult started complaining I\u2019d switch the rooms back and make your older daughter deal with the smaller room plus having her own child with her, why does she get to come and impose her wants over everyone else\u2019s?", "NTA. She has asked, you have answered. That needs to be the end of it. \n\nTell her that the subject is closed for further discussion; If she doesn't like the arrangment, she can find accomodations elsewhere. As long as she is in your home, she will be sharing a room with her son.", "NTA\n\nYes your daughter has hit a rough patch but when she gets a job and tries to find housing she can afford depending COL in your area she might be lucky to afford a studio or 1 bedroom.   \n\nAnd sorry but I doubt your plan is for her to meet someone anytime in the near future and bring them home to your house.  \n\nSo yes it would be nice to not share with her son but you\u2019ve already booted your oldest living at home daughter out to make room for her sister. \n\nAgree with other posters that if you wife is so hot on daughter needing her own space then the room with en-suite goes back to the 16 year old, returning daughter gets the smallest bedroom and shares a bath with whomever else.", "NTA there is a BIG difference between 8 yrs and 4yrs.  Your nephew is being generous saying he\u2019ll share sometimes.\n\nYour daughter is being selfish. If she doesn\u2019t like it she can move out and pay rent on a 2 bedroom", "NTA. Compromises in other people's living situations were already made for her. Also a 4 year old (who is in preschool and learning to count) and an 8 year old (likely 3rd grade and learning multiplication) are at vastly different stages. 4 years may not be a big gap for adults but the 8 year old is LITERALLY twice as old as the 4 year old. This would not be the right thing I do to your nephew. Was your daughter planning to give back the bigger room if she wasn't sharing? You and everyone living in your home have already made adjustments to support her. Hard no. NTA", "NTA - almost 4 and 8 years old is a big difference.  \nYour nephew shouldn\u2019t have to share his room with a kid that young.  \nThey will have different bed times, interests, your nephew will want friends over.  \nYour daughter chose to a child, she may not have chosen to be single but the kid is still hers, he\u2019s her responsibility.", "NTA. Sacrifices have been made already to give her a safe, comfortable place to live. The difference between 4 and 8 is huge. Your 8 year old should not have to become an overnight babysitter.", "NTA. I don't know your adopted nephew but I'm so damn proud of him. Not only did he accept to move if necessary but he also said if he keeps the room your grandson can have sleepovers. He's really young and already has such a golden heart and a kind soul. You have a gem in him.", "NTA - your daughter shouldn't expect everyone to change their lives for her. She's an adult who asked you to help, you are already being generous and helping her. It's really rude that she won't take no for an answer", "NTA.  Your daughter is lucky to have a home to boomerang to. And if she hates sharing, it\u2019s incentive to get her own place.", "Nta", "NTA\u2026but then shouldn\u2019t your daughter get her room back?", "NTA. Your older daughter is entitled and your 16 y/o is generous to a fault.", "NTA\n\nYou have a full house and did what you could to accommodate her and her son", "Look, I have empathy for your daughter. But an almost 4 yo is just too young to be sharing a bedroom with an 8 yo. I feel sorry for your daughter that\u2019s moved back home, but her child\u2019s life is upside down, too, and it\u2019s not fair to the 8 yo to have to share a room with a child toddler who may be getting up in the night. That\u2019s his Mom\u2019s job. \n\nI will say, however, that it doesn\u2019t sound like you & your wife discussed this too much before the move.", "NTA - she can have the room she has now - or you move your daughter back in and she can have that room - or no room", "Nta\n\nBut this situation isn't sustainable long term.\n\nWhat's your goal? Does your daughter and wife agree?\n\nIs it to get daughter to move out?\n\nIs it to produce a room for grandson when 16 year old leaves for college.\n\nOr are you thinking things should continue like they are now for ever?", "I want to say NTA but I can\u2019t.  As I read I just have a few doubts- are you not ok with your daughter separating from her husband by any chance? Because usually a 8year and 4 year old boy could share a room, they are kids after all but that would suggest a more permanent plan of action. But you want your daughter to share her room with her son despite her objection. Why are you disregarding what your wife thinks, does her opinion not matter?", "While you are not responsible for the problem and your daughter should be grateful for your help - your message in no way indicates you have any empathy for her.  It sounds as if she and your grandson are begrudgingly in your home.  As a woman who was a single mom after my husband cheated, I can say having my own bedroom was a godsend.  Sharing with a child is difficult.  That said, your home is only so big.  I will go with NTA but not a hero either.", "NTA, she is an adult and a mother.  She needs to get her act together and get her own place.  The sharing of the room is just the start.  Ask the teenagers how often she tries to dump her kid on them.", "Nta. She can deal with the arrangements or feel free to make arrangements to her specifications in a different location.", "NTA. She should be grateful to have a place to go. It sounds like you have a full house there.  Is she paying rent or for food, etc?", "NTA, your daughter is incredibly selfish and entitled. Beggars can't be choosers. Her son will try to go to her room at night anyway. This situation will hopefully encourage her to find a job and 2 bedroom place of her own.", "NTA. Nephew shouldn\u2019t have to share his bedroom. She chose to marry her hubby, no one else should suffer for her consequences.", "NTA- That's roughly the age gap between me and my sister and they are SUCH different ages. Different bed times, different interests, different maturity. Or put another way, the 8YO immediately loses all rights over their own life to the phrase \"He's only little, he doesn't understand!\" First it will be \"No more story/reading for a bit before sleep because 4YO is already asleep and you can't wake him up.\" then \"You can't expect him to be in here with all your toys and not play with them\" followed by  \"He doesn't understand that toy is dofferent to the other toys and special to you/more fragile, he just wanted to play with it\" followed by \"He's only little, he didn't mean to break them\" followed by \"If your friends are over you have to include him or it's not fair on him\" (meaning you and your friends have to play 4YO suitable games or that's 'not including him'). Having her company forced on me is the major factor that put me off kids for life. I used to dream of the day I could move out and never have to live knowing I could never have even the tiniest little thing to myself again. Don't take this huge thing of having his own space to retreat to away from him when he's probably already had his life compromised by the kid being in the house. Be honest, if he's tried to do his own thing when the 4YO wants his company, has your daughter already told him he HAS to do what the 4YO wants?", "Nta", "NTA \n\nShe should be grateful!", "A 4 year old and an 8 year old is a huge age gap.\n\nIf the boy's own mother doesn't want to share with him, what makes her think anyone else would (or should)?\n\nAlso that poor boy is going through something too and NEEDS his mother close by.", "This is the nephews home. Your daughter is a guest while she gets on her feet. Is she any closer to independence after living with uncle all this time? She doesn\u2019t get to dictate the spaces for others in their home.", "She can always pay for a two bedroom flat. Oh no, she can't afford that.\n\nMaybe she should be grateful for your help\n\nNTA", "NTA. It is a parent's job to provide a place for their minor children to sleep.  She is the mother of the grandson. The only place she has is her room so that's where she is going to need to put her kid.  When she gets childcare and a job she can look for a place that suits her better.  Until then, that room is what she has and it's generous at that unless you are renting it to her at market rates.  She probably wants the room empty so she can start dating arguing she's an adult and can have who she wants in her room regardless of the safety of that for others in the home.  But even if not that... SHE needs to provide for HER minor child.", "A 4 year old an an 8 year old are not on enough of the same plane of existence for that to be enjoyable.  When you get older, these gaps aren't so \"big\"--a 24M and a 28M rooming together wouldn't be eons apart in life stages.  But this young, it can feel like a galaxy. \n\nYour daughter should be grateful for what you're providing.

Your daughters problems in life don\u2019t become your other children\u2019s. She can share with her son.", "NTA. A 4 year ages gap at that ages is huge. I think your nephew was more than reasonable that he agreed to let your grandson spend some nights in his room having a sleep over which should be more than enough. You need to put your foot down with your daughter or she is likely to make your nephew feel like he\u2019s a burden and in the way for not wanting to share. Your 16 year old daughter also gave up a better bedroom with en-suite with the understanding that it was going to be used by your daughter and grandson. Just because she\u2019s having a hard time now doesn\u2019t mean she can push around the children that are legally dependent on you around since she had her time living at home and now needs to try and fit in with the current household.", "NTA\n\nBut a mother who doesn't want to share with her own child???\nBut sharing with her ex was no problem?!?\n\nYes she has a hard time....like her son, who lost his father and left the country, family he known and his little friends.\n\nYour daughter came surely to start new but all this is like, she wants to stay forever with a live in babysitter aka her cousin  for her son....\n\nShe should be a guest and bevave like one.\n\nP.S. does she have a permission to take her son away? \n\nMost countries don't like it and call it kidnapping", "NTA.

Having his own room that\u2019s his secure space is super important. The last thing an adopted child needs is to feel they\u2019re being passed for pillar to post and put after other family members.

But you are so right about the 'space invasion', reading between the lines there's been a certain amount of chaos in 8YO's life to date, and 4YOs are small chaos demons. it'd be bad enough for any 8YO to have a 4YO forced on them all of a sudden like that (very different to sharing from early on), for this kid it could be too much.", "I\u2019d be very careful about how to ask the nephew in that case. It would be easy to make him feel like he\u2019s obligated to agree because the family spent so much effort on partitioning the room. The age gap they have is pretty close to the gap between me and my younger brother, and although we would occasionally do sleepovers in his room (we found a set of free bunk beds someone was getting rid of, right when he was ready to switch to a \u201creal bed\u201d) I would *not* have wanted to consistently share a space with him at those ages.", "Probably so she can get her beauty rest & come & go as she pleases without waking her son up. I'm just guessing though.", "Not everyone wants to do that. She may want some space because she has been suffering for a while and is constantly taking care of her son.So, she's asking people who are her family to give her some space at night to process her life. OP is NTA, but the notion that she wants to bring home men is ridiculous. If she wants a man, there are plenty of places outside. But this doesn't seem to be the case here.", "What's your solution? Just shaft the 8 year old because he's a kid? 8 yr olds don't have much in common with 4 yr olds. OP is a total champ for asking the 8 year old what he wants and respecting it.\n\nOP already rearranged the home to give her a large room with an ensuite bath. If she doesn't like the solution she should work to provide one that works for her seeing as she's an adult. Why should daughter's needs be prioritized above everybody else's in the household? Be a hero to her and a jerk to everyone else. That sounds fair to you?", "My thought when reading this was yes, this isn't a sustainable situation, but that OP doesn't want it to be, and as you say, this situation will likely push his daughter to hopefully get her own place. Not that he's desperate for his daughter to move out, but that having his daughter and her son living with them forever isn't on the cards. If he forces the nephew to share with his grandson, then his daughter will be a lot slower in finding another plan. Nephew has said that he's open to occasional sleepovers, and that means daughter isn't sharing a room every night with her son, but this isn't a permanent solution, and that's fine.", "Yep. Wife wants OP to think of the daughter whose whole life is changing, but what about the 3yo whose whole life has changed? Putting him in with a reluctant older roommate instead of his mother is not the answer.", "Oh I would ask the boy FIRST and I honestly don't thing the daughter would move into the smaller room with no bath.  To me the age gap would be a nonstarter anyway."]}
