My mom would hold my candy and i got a couple of pieces but would eventually forget about it.", "Even if not tampered, open packages is gross. Chuck out that germy crap", "No. No!!! The perfect plan is to kill a family and take over their home in the days leading up to Halloween. If you haven't already poisoned a bag of candy, then you need to start this sooner. Anyway, once the family is deceased, you poison the candy so that it's the freshest. On Halloween, you sit on the front porch in costume to conceal your identity. And to make sure greedy ass parents and teenagers aren't stealing all of your death candy! Then you wait. But not at the house. Even after they track down the typhoid Mary of candy, you're not there. The family is deceased... What happened????? \n\nNo one steal this. I'm eventually going to write it into a short story of ridiculous Halloween bullshit. Thank you.", "The last mass poisoning I remember is the cyanide in Tylenol. And they still don\u2019t know who did it.", "Jesus. \n\nWhat's your particular beef against a parent being careful?! You'd like to see US kids getting even fatter?!", "Lol, my kids have a LOT of little cousins, mostly toddlers at the moment. \n\nAll it takes is seeing one kid stick a candy in his mouth, decide it's yucky, and then put it right back in the candy bucket to realize that any opened candy is potentially \"gently used\" candy.\n\nThey all police that opened food thing themselves now, lol.", "And bravo for protecting them from the \u201cscripture candy\u201d. That crap always gets thrown out first in my house. Stop trying to indoctrinate children.", "Thanks for the explanation re the opened candy. Makes a lot of sense And What? Never heard of scripture candy lol. Does it have bible verses on it?", "Yeah it\u2019s like saying I\u2019ve done drugs but never overdosed so they are completely safe", "That is not too old to be trick or treating. Yall want kids to grow up too fast. Let them enjoy  Halloween. My daughters are 13 and 15, dressed up and went trick or treating with their friends and had fun.\n\nAnyway OP don't eat candy that has been opened. It's unhygienic.", "It's not old lmao I did it until I was 22", "little man's thinking it's cool eat preopened candy. his mom's right to want to go through it.", "I don\u2019t care how old you are you show up to my house in costume, your getting a rice krispy treat. It\u2019s all for fun anyways", "My daughter is 14 and went trick or treating with her friends. They got dressed up and looked awesome and had a great time. Stop telling teenagers that they can\u2019t have fun. Btw, your mom loves you and just wanted to make sure you don\u2019t get sick. My daughter and I went through her candy together. I say NAH because I understand where you\u2019re coming from as I too once was 14", "I'm 17 and still trick or treat \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 would you rather I egg your house? Because people who think there's a time limit on fun with friends get their house egged\n\nEven better cuz I can drive my guilty egg-throwin ass away LOL", "Gum \ud83d\ude02", "That story absolutely ruined free samples for me. I mean so did everything else the last few years but now it's all a hard pass.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "ok sure jan", ">There were warnings just this year about candy laced with fentanyl.\n\nThose are hoaxes.", "There were idiot warnings from idiots who think, drug dealers waste money to poison random kids. \n\nGrow up.", "[Nope! the only real instances of that are parents using the myth to cover up killing their own kids](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisoned_candy_myths)", "For sure! And I feel like these urban legends reduce the fear of the real dangers you've mentioned.", "I've had this happen a few times, especially with mini chocolate bars which are popular at Halloween. It isn't super obvious because it isn't as though the wrapper is torn open, but the glue closing the edge of the wrapper isn't properly sealed so there's an open gap.", "This year I poured some of the fun sized candies out of the bag into a bowl and one was fully unwrapped.", "The point is that mom should be checking the candy anyway, as should every parent, because a lot of candy can have packaging defects leaving them open, and they should be discarded.", "There was another where a woman poisoned her husband and poisoned other excedrine bottles to make it look random\n\n[Source - her name was Stella Nickell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stella_Nickell)", "Why do you know the guy\u2019s motive if he was never caught?\n\nFBI, please check up on this guy.", "Thanks, now I need to go bleach my brain", "EWWWWWWWWWW. What the FUCK is wrong with people", "This is disgusting, but I'm dying at the typo", "\ud83d\udc40 I\u2019m the house that gives out the weed candy, but they\u2019re labeled and handed to the grown ups only and only if they ask for it. \n\nAlso, when I go through my nibblings candy I look for the stuff that\u2019s been opened cause they\u2019re usually stale and one time I found worms in an opened packet of kitkat sooo not looking for the drugs lmao just making sure my kiddos don\u2019t eat anything bad or buggy.", "My grandmother told me to look for Fentanyl disguised as Skittles or Smarties. I was so disappointed I could barely eat all the KitKats", "If I had an award to give you'd get it.", "lmao, this is the best!!", "Agreed! Your never too old to go trick or treating! Yesterday we had kids and teens coming around for candy and I was honestly happily surprised by the teens manners and it made my night to see some of the parents dressed up and enjoying the festivities as well! IMO it's just smart practice to not eat opened candy. Personally I've always been terrified of finding bugs in open candy \ud83e\udd22 happened once and I NEVER forgot it.", "Anyone who shows up at my door in costume gets candy. I don't care if you're 104. Costume = candy.", "He's 14. I'm an insanely overprotective mother but that's a bit much.", "I would be thrilled to get any trick-or-treaters. It seems as though knocking on people's door and asking for candy is a lost art.", "Don't 14 year olds know how to go through candy themselves?", "Are you kidding? I was in college at 17. You're telling me that either I think it's adorable for you to be trick or treating or you're going to go around egging houses? Just drive to the store and buy some candy.", "You sound like you peaked in kindergarten.", "Any food you don't make has this risk. Don't pretend like you're safe just because you avoid samples.", "If you leave another comment in this thread, I am banning you.\n\nCalm the fuck down and stop insulting people.", "But you said in your earlier comment they were meant to kill kids. How do you increase addiction by killing people?\n\nAnyway, it's a hoax.\n\n[https://www.snopes.com/news/2022/09/28/rainbow-fentanyl-scare-halloween/](https://www.snopes.com/news/2022/09/28/rainbow-fentanyl-scare-halloween/)\n\n[https://www.cnet.com/news/misinformation/halloween-hoax-no-drugs-will-not-be-in-your-kids-trick-or-treat-bags/](https://www.cnet.com/news/misinformation/halloween-hoax-no-drugs-will-not-be-in-your-kids-trick-or-treat-bags/)", "You sound 10. Eating opened candy you got from a stranger isn't a good idea. That's just common sense.", "Well I don\u2019t really care, as a parent I rather be cautious. I don\u2019t really know what your goal is here lol make parents not look through their kids candy?", "*I ask why she was throwing out my candy and her excuse was this the candies were opened and it was a new neighborhood and we don't know anyone here yet*\n\nI'm not going to debate you that candy can have packaging defects but the specific wording of OP suggests mom is nuts. There's no neighborhood of evil people that want to hurt your kids via halloween candy.", "I might be remembering some speculation about it and conflating it with motive. Looks like you\u2019re right. Still nobody has been arrested for it.", "It could have been seamen semen?", "I want to go to your house!", "My mom said the same thing when I was taking my son out. \u201cI was like mom how many people do you know who give away drugs for free?\u201d", "does you kid think it's alright to eat opened candy that a stranger gave you?\n\nyes he's too old to get his candy checked. he's also too old to willingly eat opened candy", "I got lots of trick or treaters this year, the last year I was able to do it I got two kids so that\u2019s why I did snacks this year in case I got stuck with them but I almost ran out", "Obviously not if you read OP\u2019s post. Open candy is not safe to consume.", "You sound like your house got egged yesterday", "I know, it's awful. Free samples is just the one that's particularly ruined for me- I used to love a half a ravioli at a Costco.", "[removed]", "You sound like a paranoid helicopter parent who thinks real information is secondary to your anxieties and fears no matter how unreasonable. Just put your kid in a bubble and never let them outside again if you don\u2019t care about reality and want to protect from even figments of your own imagination.", "Being cautious is one thing, spreading misinformation and fear mongering is another.", "I've seen lots of pictures today of parents that has found razor blades in their kids candy, even some needles.\n\nSo I can really understand her mom, atleast when it comes to a new neighborhood.\n\nEdit: I know most grown people would never put razor blade or anything other dangerous in candy, it is more teenagers that does stuff like that \"as a prank\".\n\nBut I would rather be safe than sorry when it comes to candy that has been opened", "If he was in the navy before joining the police ... Yes", "For God's sake, a tummy ache is the only big danger here. How on Earth are you going to let him go away to college in 3 years?", "Enjoy your wild life.", "So what's the point of lacing candy with drugs? you said it was to kill kids. How do you make addicts out of dead children?", "It's unhygienic. No matter how you spend it.", "You are dying on a hill that is not worth it, don\u2019t tell parents how to parent ty", "Really? You've seen lots of pictures just today of something that has only happened a couple times over the past half century, each time by the parents?

Correcting false information you're posting isnt an attack on all parents.", "You're getting all worked up about a scare that was generated by conspiracy theorists 40 years ago. It's all nonsense.", "But you just said it's to make kids addicted in an earler comment, and now you're saying it's just because people are sick. But that doesn't make sense either. Fentanyl is a drug; it's worth money. Why would people throw away all this money on the off chance they might kill people when they could be selling it?\n\nAnd if Fentanyl-laced candy has been found, why hasn't it made any newspapers?", "I don't care about the particulars of trick or treating.
