We'd all lived together as friends for several years which I know is obviously a bad idea but it seemed to work fine for us - we more or less had to when the pandemic started. We didn't want to break our lease after this all went down because none of us could afford to and I figured I could handle a couple tough months. My mental health already wasn't great, but it completely went down the drain. I felt extremely depressed, paranoid, eating made me feel sick, and I had panic attacks daily. They would say \"everything would be easier if you just didn't exist\"\n\nBasically immediately after I found out, they started constantly begging me not to tell our mutual friends. We had a really close-knit friend group from college, and because we graduated and moved to a new city together mid-pandemic, and also because we we're all pretty reserved/introverted people, we don't really have friends outside of that friend group.\n\nI ended up promising both of them that I wouldn't tell anyone. I was so depressed and lonely at the time that I would do anything to just not lose friends, which I know is stupid of me. But yeah, I promised them that I wouldn't tell any of our friends.\n\nA little bit later, one of our friends asked me why I had started acting so reserved and if I was doing ok. I ended up blurting out everything that had happened and crying to them about it and they were so so so kind and lovely and validating. They're the only reason I didn't blame myself for 100% of this whole situation. But then, that kinda encouraged me to tell more people. I wasn't just going around using it as a conversation starter, but I was pretty open with the information. People were so kind and supportive about it and my mental health had been really horrible. This was over the course of several months.\n\nCut to now - we all moved out (they moved in together) and I'm in a much better place mentally. I blocked them on social media and can live my life without thinking about it all the time. Until today, my former friend contacted me and said our mutual friends were refusing to hang out or sometimes even respond. She asked one of them why and they told her they knew what went down. She was LIVID. Said that I'm immature and a pot-stirrer and just trying to spread gossip. She told me I had turned all of their friends against them, and that I had sent my ex spiraling into a really bad depression which I know is pretty serious for them. She said she knew it was a hard situation for me but that I should've found other ways to deal with it besides trying to get \"revenge\" on her and my ex.\n\nI do see where she's coming from - she and my ex just lost all of their friends and now they feel isolated and abandoned, and maybe if I had thought it through a little more I could've found a better way to handle the situation?", "created_utc": 1694680056, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ict35/aita_for_turning_their_friends_against_them/", "score": 98, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You didn't turn their friends against them; they did it to themselves with their actions.", "NTA\n\nIt was their actions that have led to this consequence.  They cheated, end of story.  You just told the truth.  Your mental health is important too.\n\nIf your ex and former bff were concerned about this coming out and your mutual friends finding out.. they they shouldn't have been sleeping together while he was still with you.", "Uh, stop that last line of thinking. You lose the right to privacy in a relationship when the relationship isn't private. Your ex and ex friend both knew what they were doing during that time was wrong, otherwise they wouldn't have asked you to hide it. They should be glad that you didn't go advertise it on social media and use it as a conversation starter. Cheating is one of the easiest things to not do in a relationship. If you mess up that one, it's because you didn't care enough to treat your partner correctly.\n\nHe ain't shit, she ain't shit and your friends are awesome for fully taking your side and cutting them out of their lives.\n\nNTA, OP. Go find a guy (or girl, whatever you're into) that's worth your time", "NTA they\u2019re cheaters that\u2019s it. They didn\u2019t want others finding out what they did because what they did was fucked up and the others would have issues with them. If they didn\u2019t want people finding out what they did they shouldn\u2019t have done it", "NTA.  Asking you to promise to keep it to yourself was ridiculous.  I assume your partner had promised you monogamy at some point.  So, their not big on keeping promises themself.  Their mental health is no longer your concern.

Your best friend and girlfriend of 5 years, who all lived together, were sleeping together. Tormenting your mental health issues (from being gaslit?) with such helpful statements like \n\n\u201c*Everything would be easier if you just didn\u2019t exist*\u201d \n\nYou find out and are, further traumatized, they extract a ridiculous promise of secrecy. They finally gtfo and your true friend wants to know why you are falling apart. You tell. ** AS YOU SHOULD** That\u2019s what real friends are for, and do. \n\nNTA. Block those skanky creeps. Maybe everything would be easier for *them* if *they* didn\u2019t exist.", "Nta\n\nIts ur friends decision to cut them off\nU just told ur side of the story\nTheir judgement of the ex and friend has nothing to do with you", "NTA\n\nThey acted like shit and then they blame you? Cut both those idiots out of your life, block them on social media and continue with your loyal friends.", "NTA - you are perfectly entitled to tell people in your life what happened to YOU and how YOU are feeling! The fact that they asked you to keep their bad behaviour (which hurt you) a secret to protect them from being judged is unfair and makes them the AH. \n\nWith regard to how they have been treated by their friend group, an old saying comes to mind - \u201cDon\u2019t do the crime if you can\u2019t do the time\u201d. People don\u2019t want to be friends with people who they don\u2019t trust or who don\u2019t align to their beliefs. Unless you lied about what happened, then it\u2019s not your fault!", "NTA. I believe people in the comments will have very unsympathetic takes on your ex and exfriend (and they're not wrong), but let me say this: you have to put yourself first. This isn't about them, nor about revenge, but if you didn't open up you would be denying yourself of your support system when you needed the most.\n\nAlso, your friends knew you were with your ex, knew you two moved together with said \"friend\" and now they are together... Eventually one of your friends would put two and two together and figure out.\n\nAnd lastly, as for them: friends come and friends go, that's life. They're grown ups, they should be able to make new friends. It's not easy, but it is simple as that. They have to start over just as you are starting over, just as every adult does at several points in their lives.", "NTA, OP. These people, who were supposed to be your partner and your friend, cheated on you behind your back, then took advantage of a pandemic and your deteriorating mental health to extricate a promise from you, and were angry when you finally found support.\nPromises have little value when given under duress. And if nothing else, look at it this way: your mutual friend group has decided whom to hang out with. If no one wants to be friends with them, then clearly, your friend group has reached a decision with available knowledge. \nYour ex's depression is not your fault. You were not using the experience as a conversation starter and it is not gossip if it is patently true. Nothing here is your fault. I hope you find peace and healing.", "FUCKED AROUND AND FOUND OUT!!! They knew what the outcome would be and still choose to hurt you. Did they care about your mental health, your depression, or how you felt overall with the betrayal? NO! They didn't have a care in the world, and neither should you. You did what was right and should have been done anyways. So, I take it that they didn't think the friend group would figure it out?  \n\nNTA, forget them, focus on you and continue to live your life.", "NTA\n\nIf they don't want to get a bad reputation, they shouldn't be cheaters/homewrecker.", "NTA - but the two of them are. The two closest people cheated on you and then had the *nerve* to try to suggest you shouldn't talk to friend?\n\nThey were literally trying to deny you a fucking support network and make you suffer alone.\n\nThey're just suffering the consequences of their actions.", "Nta\n\nThey are bad friends and your mutuals are better off for knowing", "NTA", "NTA .. that\u2019s ridiculous. You told the truth. If the truth was something that was wrong.. that\u2019s on them.. not you", "NTA so he cheated on you, with your bestfriend, they told you it would be better that you didn't exist and then tried to isolate you from any support mechanism to deal with all that for their own selfish benefit?\n\nThey are the nastiest, pond-scummy type of people and do not deserve a single second more of your time, thoughts or energy. \n\nI am sorry they did that to you and wish you all the happiness for the future.", "NTA at all.\n\nHow are she! She and your ex betrayed your trust and cheated on you with each other.  That is such a deep level of betrayel.  Then they demanded you not tell the rest of your friends about their horrible, selfish, disgusting behavior.\n\nYou didn't betray anything.  She and your ex were extremely shitty and had no right to demand that you, the victim of their betrayel, protect Then.\n\nTell her you own them nothing.  They betrayed you then emotionally manipulated you.\n\nThey are trash and got what they deserve", "NTA. Been there.  No loyalty is owed to those who show no loyalty. They didn't want to lose face, maybe they shouldn't have been two-faced.  There are people who will justify the behavior for their \"friendship\", I am not one of them.", "NTA\n\n\"I had turned all of their friends against them\"\n\nNo, you didn't. They did this to themselves & they deserve each other.\n\nYou may not have many friends but you have good friends and that's what counts.\n\nI would cut all contact with them. You don't need people like the exs in your life.", "Wow ..talk about gaslighting...man your ex friends behaviour is definition of gaslighting and making you feel bad about their mistakes... they are reaping what they have sowed..and the fact they blame their reactions on you is so ridiculous and entitled..hope they figure out on their own to come out of this.but this has nothing to do with you. Your friends decided for themselves..NTA", "Those two betrayed you, insulted you, had the audacity to ask you not to tell anyone, and started to gaslight you  when you told anyway, causing the friend group to not want to be around them.

That's some psycho behaviour.\n\n>I do see where she's coming from - she and my ex just lost all of their friends and now they feel isolated and abandoned\n\nWhat? Like you did when you got cheated on and shoved into a corner, afraid to tell anyone because you expected the same treatment?

You did nothing wrong here.", "When my ex-wife started cheating on me with her best friend, she begged me not to tell anyone. I didn\u2019t. Then she started becoming more verbally, abusive, telling me I was worthless, telling me I was ruined, and begged me not to tell anyone. And I didn\u2019t.

When someone violates your trust so completely like this, any promises you make, while still in their thrall, particularly while you\u2019re still living together and need to keep the peace in your home, are part of the abuse and manipulation. Telling the people that love you the truth is part of breaking free of that abuse. Telling that truth is brave.

Yea, it still would have hurt, but they wouldn't be cheaters. I'm projecting here but I'm sure most of your friends would have understood, their feelings grew for each other while living together and they respectfully told you and ended it before taking it to the next level. They did not do this. They carried on an intimate relationship with each other while lying to you. Then they used your emotional state to get you to agree to keeping their nasty secret. BTW, do they think your friends group is stupid? They noticed you were acting differently and asked you about it. Even if you hadn't told them they would have seen that you are now no longer with your bf and he is with the other friend and you no longer have contact with either of them. Doesn't take a genius to figure out. NTA for sure!", "NTA. They don't get to be mad at you for breaking a promise they never should have made you make. They especially don't get to be mad at you because they're being judged for their own actions.

If you don't want your friends to find out you're a backstabbing cheater, don't be a backstabbing cheater.  This is not rocket science.
