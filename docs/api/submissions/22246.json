We kept in touch and eventually found ourselves both living in a big city in America and began dating  Since we met in Paris, we go once a year, usually in September.  It isn\u2019t really an exclusively romantic thing so we have gone with friends or family on a few of these trips.  It\u2019s just something we like to do together but we don\u2019t mind sharing it too.\n\nMy SIL, Charley (30F), and her fianc\u00e9, Mike (31F) asked if they could come this year. SIL and Mike do not have a ton of extra funds (maybe 1 trip every couple years), Connor and I are able to take between 4-5 a year thanks to flexible work schedules and funds.  About 2 months ago, Charley and Mike decided they want to get married next month in a small ceremony instead of planning a big wedding.\n\nI have been putting an itinerary together for the trip, lots of \u201cfirst time in Paris stuff\u201d that we haven\u2019t done in a long time or ever so no problem for us.  I use a Google sheet and just share it with the people who are traveling with us (many of our trips are group trips). I shared with them when we first booked and have been making casual updates until 2 weeks ago when Mike reached out.\n\nHe called me to tell me that he has decided that this trip will be their honeymoon.  I thought it was a little weird but understood that they can\u2019t really afford multiple trips. Here is where things began to unravel.  SIL doesn\u2019t want to go on her honeymoon with other people so she called us and asked us to reschedule our trip so we are not there at the same time.  We said no to that but said we can each can do our own thing.  I copied the Google Sheet I had made and began working on the new one.  Additionally, I separated the flight itineraries so they could control their own, canceled the extra room I had reserved on my credit card, etc.\n\nOver the last few weeks, I have continued with our plans, I have made reservations and such for just my husband and me.  A couple of days ago I got a call from my SIL asking if I had made any other plans because the spreadsheet hadn't been updated. I said that I had been making plans but just for Connor and me since we were taking separate trips.\n\nApparently, they didn't realize that we were going to keep the arrangements we made for ourselves and expected them to make their own.  They thought we would replan everything and continue planning their trip.  SIL is pissed that she lost out on the hotel rate I had (wants my room now) and the tickets for attractions I got for the times that we had planned.  She is demanding we give her these things because we were being \"spiteful\" when we didn't explicitly tell them we would no longer be planning their trip. I thought them telling us they wanted to be alone on their honeymoon and us agreeing to this made it clear.  MIL said I should just give it to her since we go every year. I contend that I never offered to be their personal travel agent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: My SIL and Fiance had been dodging our phone calls after they said they wanted us to move our trip dates.  They were annoyed that we wouldn't so I sent her the following text after mutliple attempts to contact them.\n\nMe: I am going to go ahead and make any an all changes so we can avoid each other on the trip if that is what you want\n\nSIL: Thats fine\n\nMe: Okay, I will just make the changes and update the spreadsheet for you. \n\nSIL: okay", "created_utc": 1689366401, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14zr4pf/aita_for_refusing_to_give_my_sil_my_paris_vacation/", "score": 61, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I understand everything else but why didn't you have a conversation about it instead of canceling everything", "ESH\n\nObviously by far they are the biggest AHs. They clearly used you to plan their honeymoon (and I suspect even scheduled their wedding at the last minute in order to make this all work) because you had experience and would plan something lovely because you had loads of knowledge of the area.  And then having the gall to ask you to not go? Unbelievably tacky. Your SIL and her groom-to-be have a lot of nerve, but no manners at all. They owe you a massive apology.\n\nThat said, you're an AH too. I might have understood (with an eyebrow raised, mind you) if you'd have said that you ONLY cancelled the tickets to attractions you'd been planning to visit together now that you'd agreed you were all going to \"do your own thing\" . . . or even if you'd separated flight stuff. But even then I'd be side-eyeing you because those are pretty major decisions that I can't imagine not double-checking (\"So, I know we're not traveling together, but I assume that you no longer want to go to the Louvre on the afternoon of the 14th with us, right? And shall I switch your flight reservations over to you in case you want to make any changes?\")\n\nBut you canceled their hotel room, knowing full well that they were still planning to go on this trip at the same time as you, even if you all weren't going to be doing things together. You had been told they were literally planning this trip as their honeymoon. And you CANCELED THEIR HOTEL ROOM THAT HAD ALREADY BEEN BOOKED, without even asking. That's just vicious and petty, no matter how you look at it. \n\nYou had every right to be angry, and every right to resent being treated as their personal travel planner. I wouldn't blame you if you didn't talk to them for years after this. \n\nBut canceling their hotel room on their honeymoon, something that was already taken care of, that you weren't paying for, and that you had to go out of your way to ruin for them, knowing that they'd have to book a new one that would cost more and probably not be as nice? Don't treat any of us like we're stupid. It was revenge, and that makes you an AH.
