We kept in touch and eventually found ourselves both living in a big city in America and began dating  Since we met in Paris, we go once a year, usually in September.  It isn\u2019t really an exclusively romantic thing so we have gone with friends or family on a few of these trips.  It\u2019s just something we like to do together but we don\u2019t mind sharing it too.\n\nMy SIL, Charley (30F), and her fianc\u00e9, Mike (31F) asked if they could come this year. SIL and Mike do not have a ton of extra funds (maybe 1 trip every couple years), Connor and I are able to take between 4-5 a year thanks to flexible work schedules and funds.  About 2 months ago, Charley and Mike decided they want to get married next month in a small ceremony instead of planning a big wedding.\n\nI have been putting an itinerary together for the trip, lots of \u201cfirst time in Paris stuff\u201d that we haven\u2019t done in a long time or ever so no problem for us.  I use a Google sheet and just share it with the people who are traveling with us (many of our trips are group trips). I shared with them when we first booked and have been making casual updates until 2 weeks ago when Mike reached out.\n\nHe called me to tell me that he has decided that this trip will be their honeymoon.  I thought it was a little weird but understood that they can\u2019t really afford multiple trips. Here is where things began to unravel.  SIL doesn\u2019t want to go on her honeymoon with other people so she called us and asked us to reschedule our trip so we are not there at the same time.  We said no to that but said we can each can do our own thing.  I copied the Google Sheet I had made and began working on the new one.  Additionally, I separated the flight itineraries so they could control their own, canceled the extra room I had reserved on my credit card, etc.\n\nOver the last few weeks, I have continued with our plans, I have made reservations and such for just my husband and me.  A couple of days ago I got a call from my SIL asking if I had made any other plans because the spreadsheet hadn't been updated. I said that I had been making plans but just for Connor and me since we were taking separate trips.\n\nApparently, they didn't realize that we were going to keep the arrangements we made for ourselves and expected them to make their own.  They thought we would replan everything and continue planning their trip.  SIL is pissed that she lost out on the hotel rate I had (wants my room now) and the tickets for attractions I got for the times that we had planned.  She is demanding we give her these things because we were being \"spiteful\" when we didn't explicitly tell them we would no longer be planning their trip. I thought them telling us they wanted to be alone on their honeymoon and us agreeing to this made it clear.  MIL said I should just give it to her since we go every year. I contend that I never offered to be their personal travel agent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: My SIL and Fiance had been dodging our phone calls after they said they wanted us to move our trip dates.  They were annoyed that we wouldn't so I sent her the following text after mutliple attempts to contact them.\n\nMe: I am going to go ahead and make any an all changes so we can avoid each other on the trip if that is what you want\n\nSIL: Thats fine\n\nMe: Okay, I will just make the changes and update the spreadsheet for you. \n\nSIL: okay", "created_utc": 1689366401, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14zr4pf/aita_for_refusing_to_give_my_sil_my_paris_vacation/", "score": 441, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

For me it was about honoring their wishes to \"not see us\" while they are on their honeymoon.  If I could have transferred the reservation, I would have but when I couldn't I went with my next option.", "What's more clear than what OP did?

The trip she and her fiance had been invited to go along with OP & her husband but then the SIL & her fiance decided to hijack as their honeymoon and kick off OP. Then to demand OP just give her the trip & reservations (which wouldn't work anyway due to hotel policies).\n\nOP doesn't owe them anything more than she gave them in the updated spreadsheet.", "Nope. Each spouse deals with their families bullshit. Period. No if ands or buts."]}
