My first degree at university was nursing, but I have been really struggling over the past few years with everything that happened, so I have gone back and done a degree in marine biology.\n\nMarine biology has always always interested me, and I was so pleased to finally start enjoying my job again. I have started working for a turtle rehabilitation centre, and I could not be more fulfilled.\n\nThe challenge comes in that my husband continuously introduces me as a tour guide in an aquarium. He thinks it is very funny, and says that it is easier to explain to people. No disrespect to those that work in aquariums, but I worked so hard to go back to school and have a job that I love. I was doing the degree part time while still working as a nurse, and my husband saw how much I struggled.\n\nWhen I was nursing, my husband never used to do this. I was always introduced as a nurse, but now he just can't/won't get it right. People always look at me with such pity when he says, \"She was a nurse, but now she works at [local aquarium].\"\n\nI have started correcting him when he introduces me to new people, which he says undermines him and makes him look like a fool in front of others. I have said he wouldn't look like a fool if he told people what I actually do, but he says he can't remember all the details and the fake job title is funny.\n\nRecently I refused to go to an event with him unless he promised to introduce me correctly, and he said that I was massively overreacting. I didn't end up going, and my husband was really frustrated especially when people who knew me at the event asked him why I hadn't gone. \n\nI am at an impasse, but he insists I am the one making a mountain out of a molehill. Am I being an AH by asking him to use my actual job title? Am I overreacting to a joke?\n\nEdit to add as I've seen the question asked a few times: My husband is an engineer.", "created_utc": 1676763852, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/115vpod/aita_for_asking_my_husband_to_use_my_correct_job/", "score": 547, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
