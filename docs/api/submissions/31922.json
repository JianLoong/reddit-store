With the help of counseling and my wife i have started to see how my sister has been trying to control all aspects of my life since we were kids, as well as actively trying to sabotage my relationship with my wife. She started with snippy comments to and about my wife, escalated to trying to ruin my wifes Bachelorette party and our wedding all the while stepping up her game of general disrespect, culminating in the fact that she refuses to talk to me so much so, that she would not respond to me wishing her a happy birthday on our shared birthday (remember twins). With all of this we have started to put up healthy boundaries between her and our kids to keep them safe much to the distain of my family,  bolth extended and my parents, so we havent talked in a while. \nNow back to the wedding seeing as the wedding is coming up we were expecting an invite and didnt get one but we did get a invite for our 8 year old son(only) that explicitly stated for just him no guests.

So we have decided to not let him go we told my parents and my sister this and were greeted with anger from her and my parents and accusations that we were just trying to keep him away from her and we were trying to break up the family.

They have made theirs.", "Wait a minute. In what world is inviting an 8 year old, without his parents, NOT an asshole move? How is your 8 year old supposed to get to the wedding, hitchhike? Call an Uber? They are not inviting you and your wife and are supposed to be promoting family values?\n\nNTA!", "NTA - YOU are not trying to break up the family - inviting only your 8Y to a wedding is breaking up the family.  Sister just needed a crazy story to add to her drama narrative of why you are not part of her \"**super amazing why would anyone want to miss it regardless of how I treat you**\" narrative.\n\nYou have a wife and two beautiful children.

How petty of a person do you have to be to invite an 8 year old to a wedding, and not his parents? Your sister sounds toxic. You should go no contact with her for the sake of your family.", "No, you are NTA for stopping your sister breaking your family. Your family is your wife, your son, yourself. \n\nYour parents, your sister are not your primary family anymore, you are not a child, you are an adult and you have started your own family. \n\nSave your family. \n\nAs for your sister, go no contact.

Inviting a child to a wedding without his parents is just crazy. It would be uncomfortable, frightening and extremely boring for him, not to mention the kind of ugly crap that would probably be said in front of and to him. And to say that it's you who's trying to break up the family? That's completely irrational. Sister did that by shunning you while inviting him. You shun parents, you shun the kids. That's just how it works when you don't live in some kind of revenge fantasy. You're wise not to let him anywhere near her or the rest of your family.", "NTA - The invitiation to your son sounds like it alone is trying to break up YOUR family. What are they planning on doing with an 8 year old . .  maybe complaining to him about his parents? I don't know what the family fight is about but this alone makes me very suspicious about your sister and the rest of your family.
