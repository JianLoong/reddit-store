My mom doesn\u2019t take me to the doctor when I\u2019m sick and I had a really awful illness a while ago that caused me to miss about 4 days of school. There\u2019s days where I go to school and my anxiety gets so bad that I vomit. With the days I went to school and got sick, and the days I missed because I was sick, I\u2019ve missed about 7 days.\n\nSchool makes me anxious. I have to see a lot of people that have hurt me and a man who committed nonconsensual acts on me. It\u2019s a mental war walking into that place every morning.\n\nLast night my mom was screaming at her boyfriend for hours. I eventually went in at 1 a.m to be their couple\u2019s counselor but she decided she didn\u2019t want to figure it out, she only wanted to yell.\n\nI went to bed at 3 in the morning and woke up several times throughout the 4 hours I could get, even when they went to bed, because I was stressed about it too. I wake up, exhausted, and start getting ready. My boyfriend calls me and asks me how I\u2019m doing, as he does every morning, and I have to tell him,\u201dI know I say it every day but I really don\u2019t know if I can handle this today.\u201d\n\nAs soon as those words come from my mouth, I start crying. He tells me if I truly feel like I can\u2019t, I shouldn\u2019t go, but I should at least try to get motivated to go. I told him every time I imagine walking I feel like puking and sobbing. He\u2019s supportive, of course.\n\nI go to my mom and tell her what happened over the night and she starts blaming me. \u201cGo to school. Your sleep schedule is fucked up. You\u2019re not doing this today,\u201dshe tells me. This makes me feel like shit and I start crying even harder and call my stepdad asking him what to do.\n\nHe says,\u201dWell, I can hardly keep my eyes open, too. She kept me up all night.\u201d\n\nWe hang up and I\u2019m sobbing waiting for him to come get me and take me, then my mom calls me in her room to scream at me. He told her he didn\u2019t think I should go. She phrases things like I was manipulating everyone and it was just me and my sleep schedule, not even considering how she kept everyone awake with her shit.\n\nI feel guilty now. I can\u2019t sleep. I\u2019m nauseous. I have a headache. I feel like it\u2019s my fault.", "created_utc": 1695126806, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16mpr50/aita_for_taking_the_day_off_school_because_of/", "score": 13, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Absolutely NTA.  Your mother is abusive to both you and her boyfriend and the burden of acting as, \"couples counselor,\" shouldn't be within a mile of your shoulders.  It's also completely reasonable to take time off from school for your mental health.  I hate that you have to go to a school where one of your abusers works.\n\nI don't know if it's possible for you to make a big change to your situation right now but if you're a senior in high school, then you're not that far off from being able to move out, and then you can see as much or as little of your mother as you want.  You just have to try your best to survive the next couple of months and then you can make your own decisions about how to live your life, and those decisions don't need to involve your horrible mother at all.  Hang in there; I promise it gets better.", "I'm so sorry for all that you are feeling and have to experience everyday at school and then at home. it sucks big.\n\nIs it an option to talk about someone(teachers? police?), if you haven't already, about the disgusting man at your school? not having to see him daily might be a small good start.\n\nYour mom doesn't seem to take good care of your, nor should you care so much for her (being her couple councelor is definitely not okay too), i'm glad you have a supportive boyfriend tho.\n\nthe only piece of advice i feel like giving you, is to keep near those who love you, like your bf, and try and distance as far as possible from who hurts you, even if it is family, for example, is it a possibility to sleep at your bf place every now and then? \nI'm not familiar with the US school system, but i hope being a senior means that next year you can find a job, or go to college, put all this behind you and start healing in a healthy environment.\n\nIn the meantime you are NTA for taking a day off school, just don't over-do it or you'll risk to be in that school for longer than needed. hugs", "NTA and I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re dealing with all of this. It sounds like your home situation is incredibly toxic and I\u2019m glad that your boyfriend is in your corner even if your mom isn\u2019t. Taking a sick day for mental health sounds completely fair in your case. Have you spoken to any counsellors or therapists about the abuse from this man? If you don\u2019t have access to therapy and your school doesn\u2019t have a counsellor, is there a teacher or other member of staff you would feel comfortable confiding in? Not necessarily details or who it was, just that this is something you\u2019re dealing with right now and that it\u2019s impacting your ability to learn. When I was dealing with something similar in my freshman year of college, I did talk to two of my professors (who I already had a good relationship with) and they were both incredibly supportive and made some accommodations for me which made a big difference in my ability to complete the work. I\u2019m guessing that switching schools isn\u2019t an option, but if you have any classes with him (I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s one of your classmates and not a member of staff), it\u2019s still early enough in the year that you could try asking to be moved to different sections without it being as noticeable.", "NTA. your mom is.", "NTA. You sound like you\u2019re in such a toxic environment. Mental health is just as important as physical health. I\u2019m a mom and I have made it clear to my kids that if they wake up and just have that \u201cI can\u2019t do today\u201d feeling, then to let me know and they can stay home for the day. They\u2019ve never abused it and it amounts to maybe 4 days a year. And the weight that lifts from their faces when I tell them they can jump back into bed tells me I\u2019m doing the right thing. I know I have days where I just don\u2019t want to face the world. Why should our kids be any different? \n\nYou have so much more reason to need a few days off than simply \u201cI can\u2019t do today\u201d that it\u2019s not funny. I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve got your bf to lean on. I hope you find a way out of that situation soon.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This is a horrible situation you are in, I am so sorry.  \n\nIt worries me there is someone at your school that harmed you and they are still at your school.  Was this harm ever reported?  \n\nYour mother sounds like she may need counseling to figure out her problems.\n\nAnxiety is crippling, I have it, I get it.  You are already a complete rockstar to get up in the morning, start to dress, those are huge moves.  I understand you need a day, but is there somewhere you can go that is not your home?  It sounds like your mother will not allow the rest for you.  Do you have family close?  \n\nYou are a senior, can you get a job somewhere to get you away from that situation and help you earn money to save, so you can move after graduation?  I know that's a big thing and seems impossible.  If you can remove yourself from that situation, you will be able to find your peace.", "They know his name and everything, they know what happened, my psychiatrist told them to give me accommodations, but the only thing I\u2019ve gotten is one class switched. The rest of it they basically told me to figure out how to manage. When I told my therapist she pinched the bridge of her nose and said,\u201dOh my God\u201d. Even though that\u2019s not a good thing, it\u2019s still good to know that I\u2019m not crazy by being annoyed with it.\n\nIt\u2019s also helpful that when I need a hug, my boyfriend is always happy to hug me. It\u2019s really comforting to know that even if the whole school thinks I\u2019m a liar, I\u2019ve still got him believing me. Not one of the people that call me a liar are gonna matter to me. The only person that is gonna matter in my future is someone I\u2019m actively bettering myself for. For a while I felt like I didn\u2019t deserve change and would rather soak in my depression, but he\u2019s actually motivated me to do better for the sake of him, even if I need help sometimes.\n\nNot as bad as it could be, and I think I have a good mindset to do better than my mom is! There\u2019s just some days where I need a break, and even when I don\u2019t feel like I deserve it, or I feel guilty about needing it, I still need it. If I have to choose where I\u2019m gonna have my self loathing mental breakdowns, I\u2019d rather have them at home, lol."]}
