(even for a vacation).\n\nSpeak to your attorney about your options and be sure to save all proof/documentation.

Do the grandparents know she's not supposed to travel that far?  Him lying to you is definitely wrong but I don't see how his parents taking her to a theme park would be to your advantage in court. \n\nIf you want more custody, you need to present facts that will show why you are a good parent - going in there bringing up dirt on him won't help you, on the contrary. Because it won't be about him, it will be all about you.", "I wanted to so bad. He scares me so bad tho. Last time I mentioned a new custody arrangement he threatened \u201cto get my butt thrown back in a mental hospital\u201d so I\u2019m a little nervous about how he\u2019s gonna take it", " No.  It\u2019s not a problem to take a child to another state when the child is in the care of that parent.  It\u2019s a problem to MOVE to another state, but many Americans cross state lines daily as just part of life.", "1.The court order says if 150 miles or state lines is crossed the other parent must approve and be notified. \n2.

Also, when he makes verbal threats or says anything else that is concerning, whether you recorded it or not you can follow up with an email along the lines of, \"When we talked by telephone on (date) at (time) you said (detail - like \"you said if I pushed for a new custody arrangement you would have me placed in a mental hospital.

Remove the emotions.

But perhaps you need to communicate to them very clearly what they can & can't do moving forward.", "And keep all communication strictly through the court parenting text app which prevents anything from being deleted. No conversations, text only.", "A lot of family courts have monitored apps for coomuncations regarding childcare issues for divorce parents. All custody related communications have to go through it, so a full record is kept for the judge to review. She should look into it", "Your parents may have done that, but many custody agreements stipulate that the other parent must provide written consent before the other parent can take the child across state lines. The reason for it is to obviously try to prevent one parent from abducting the child and moving to another state with them. If the parent doesn't agree and the other parent still takes the child to another state, they can be charged with abduction.", "She only sees her child 3 weekends a month.

This is so random, but decades ago  I caught part of a Judge Judy ep.\n\nThe plaintiff had a notebook filled with dates/times, conversations. The defendant didn't and kept saying things like, \"she was just yelling at me.\"\n\nJJ: \"about what?\" \n\nD: \"I don't know,, just being irrational.\" \n\nJJ looked at the notes and said that specific documentation is much more meaningful than accusations which can't be backed up along with name-calling and debasing.", "Exactly. I understand from numerous lawyer friends that this is considered *prima facie* evidence in court.\n\nFurther, I have had friends walk into court with a printed-folder (in one case) or notebook (in another case) of documented evidence. \n\nIn the first case, the contra party just quit the court action and it was dismissed with prejudice. In the second, the judge immediately ruled for my friend.\n\nNotes on paper is the way to go!", "Awesome to hear that! \n\nAnd, if he's the type who has threatened her with holds and whatnot, you know he's the type to deny it. So any evidence to undermine him when he says she's making that up only further proves he's not a reliable narrator. In court, that's gold."]}
