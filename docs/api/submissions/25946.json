In most custody agreements, parents are not allowed to take the child out of state without informing the other parent. (even for a vacation).\n\nSpeak to your attorney about your options and be sure to save all proof/documentation. While this is not a huge deal, it does demonstrate that the father does not view you as an equal parent, and his behavior (if you have documented proof) should help you increase your time with your daughter.", "NTA, he legit lied to you about your daughter being sick and then allowed her to be taken across state lines without your consent.

This was the right move.\n\nETA:  when your daughter's paternal grandparents learned you did not know, what was their reaction?", "You say that you would've let her go but if he lied to you then obviously he believes you wouldn't. Do the grandparents know she's not supposed to travel that far?  Him lying to you is definitely wrong but I don't see how his parents taking her to a theme park would be to your advantage in court. \n\nIf you want more custody, you need to present facts that will show why you are a good parent - going in there bringing up dirt on him won't help you, on the contrary. Because it won't be about him, it will be all about you.", "I wanted to so bad. He scares me so bad tho. Last time I mentioned a new custody arrangement he threatened \u201cto get my butt thrown back in a mental hospital\u201d so I\u2019m a little nervous about how he\u2019s gonna take it", " No.  It\u2019s not a problem to take a child to another state when the child is in the care of that parent.  It\u2019s a problem to MOVE to another state, but many Americans cross state lines daily as just part of life.", "1.The court order says if 150 miles or state lines is crossed the other parent must approve and be notified. \n2. It prevented me from getting 2 out of the three", "All of it is documented.

I'd mention the threats in your statement to the courts if you do go ahead.", "So you have that threat in writing? Give it to your lawyer.", "If you have that in text bring it to court and tell the judge he is trying to blackmail you into getting less custody. Blackmail is a crime.", "It depends on what's in the custody agreement. \n\nIf it's approved and within it, it's fine. If custody orders forbids it, then it's a legal issue.", "Pretty obviously NTA. Court orders are there for a reason. If they are not respected, there needs to be consequences.", "Since he is violating the court orders, heck yeah, take him to court.  Make sure you have everything documented.  NTA.", "And WI is a one-party consent state for recording calls, so good job.", "His dad was telling me that if I would\u2019ve known I would\u2019ve stopped it so he told my ex not to tell me. Ex\u2019s parents are divorcing because of how his dad treats me as a parent and his mom as a person.", "True! Also, when he makes verbal threats or says anything else that is concerning, whether you recorded it or not you can follow up with an email along the lines of, \"When we talked by telephone on (date) at (time) you said (detail - like \"you said if I pushed for a new custody arrangement you would have me placed in a mental hospital. Rest assured my intention is to do what's best for my daughter.\")\n\nNon-confrontational wording is important. You're just documenting what he said on the phone."]}
