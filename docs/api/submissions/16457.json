In fact, you give her shit for \u201cnot working\u201d and downplay her importance in her husband\u2019s business.

Losing several hours of pay is a hardship, so I understand your frustration.  But your SIL has been providing FREE childcare, including picking up your son from school, and probably providing snacks and meals.  Asking her to reimburse you for your lost wages when she has been helping you for free for a long time is a slap in her face.\n\nWhat if it were a true emergency?  What would you have done then?\n\nIt's your responsibility to make certain you have back-up plans for childcare for your son.  \n\nIt sounds like you cost yourself free childcare for your son.  I think you owe your SIL a sincere apology.", "YTA\n\nYour SIL is doing you a favor by picking up your child. You aren't paying her by the sounds of it.

He is your responsibility, not hers.\n\nIf you sent me a bill for this, I wouldn't pick up your son anymore either.\n\nYou bit the hand feeding you.....", "YTA\n\nYour SIL watches your son for free and out of common decency. She's allowed to have things just \"pop\" up. You should have a contingency plan for this type of situation. What would you do if school was suddenly canceled and your SIL couldn't watch your son? They don't plan those closings in advance if there's bad weather.", "It's shitty that she bailed on you last minute, definitely, but that doesn't mean she owes you money, especially since every other day she's providing you a service you'd otherwise have to pay a substantial sum to access.

Yeah you missed out on work but you should have back up plans and Venmo asking for money is dumb since it would easily cost you $1000+ a month for other babysitting options", "YTA.  i get that she brought it on you at the last minute, and that's frustrating.  but it sounds like she's doing you a favor?  you didn't mention that you normally pay her.  so why would you charge her?  i'm on her side, i wouldn't pay you either.  and now it sounds like you may have burned a bridge with her.  if she refuses to help you out any more, you're going to have to pay for childcare, and it's expensive.\n\np.s. why did you put \"helps out\" in quotations?  sounds like that's exactly what she's doing.", "This has to be fake. Of course YTA. SIL gets to spend all her evenings babysitting your son for free OR she can pay you so she can live her own life?", "INFO Can't you just deduct that money from the money you pay your SIL for picking up your son EVERY day and babysitting?  I mean obviously you pay her or you'd be an AH the size of Cleveland.", "The move you made is an AH move. You shod have talked to her first. In the end, its not her kid. She helps out.\n\nIt was aholish to break the commitment last min, but maybe they got the tickets late.", "YTA . You make no mention if this was a one off, but you seem to have an issue with your SIL wanting to go out to have some fun. What your SIL did was a little shitty, but is it really worth alienating someone who you clearly rely on to look after your Son ? \n\nYou've lost sight of the bigger picture here.", "YTA. Majorly. \n\n~~How much are you paying your sister for babysitting your son? And does this payment include reimbursement for gas and food?~~\n\nSomeone pointed out that the answer bot indicates you don't pay her. So she's watching your son for free 5 days a week, from 3 to 8, for nothing. She has given up, essentially, a solid chunk of her \"prime time\" free time during the weekday to be a guardian to your son. \n\nShe picks him up and watches him for the bulk of the late afternoon and evening. She's responsible, I would assume, for meals and snacks too. She helps him with homework, too. \n\nBut because, one day, she wants one evening to do something fun with her husband last minute, you think *she* owes *you* money? Maybe she should send you a Venmo request for all the childcare she's done, or work she's missed (notice how you dismiss her work as \"helping out\" her husband's business) because she's busy taking care of your child. \n\nYou're about to find out just how much $$$$ even bare-bones childcare costs and I bet you won't like it.

Because you just did that.", "YTA plus sending that request pretty much guarantees that SIL won't help you again.", "YTA! I get it is hard. But no one is responsible for your kid but you.  What if you had a regular non family babysitter you paid and they got sick? Would you charge them? You don't even pay this family member, she is doing YOU a favor!

And while I appreciate that you had to leave your job and it cost you a lot - I can't see how seeking reimbursement from your unpaid servant is appropriate.

And then I'd very politely ask if in the future she could consider giving you at least 24 hours notice, so you don't have to leave your job early?\n\nIf you sent me a Venmo text, I'd stop picking your kid up and watch while you figure yourself out. That's just really a mean thing to do to someone who helps you out all the time?", "YTA. I\u2019ve been providing free childcare for my grandson (6) since the minute he came home from the hospital. Until he started school, that meant up to 6 days a week and I work full time. Now, I am with him briefly on Thursdays, overnight on Fridays and til 4 pm on Saturday. \n\nI also watch my grandson when my single daughter has a rare night out or girls weekend. She is currently in Ireland on a 10-day work study trip with her university, so I took the entire time off to stay with my little guy. \n\nYou know why I do this?  #1 is I am simply the best person to watch him. We are great buddies and my daughter knows I feed him well, make sure he\u2019s fed and cleaned properly, does his homework and completes his chores. I have never raised a hand to him and I am very careful with how I speak to him when he needs correction. I don\u2019t yell and he\u2019s never had a tantrum with me. I like to think that my daughter and I are nearly 100% aligned on how her boy is cared for because he is truly a wonderful child. \n\nSomewhat paralleling your SIL who doesn\u2019t have to work, I have the flexibility of a good job with generous work/life/PTO balance. \n\nMy daughter is quite aware I have a great job and soon she would start saying, \u201cI need you (on  rare days off from work and childcare) to watch him on Sunday. I\u2019m going out. I have a date.\u201d  But she never asked me.  She would TELL me. \n\nI started gently suggesting that she ask me if I could watch my GS. She got a little better and even started saying thank you, but recently she was having challenges picking him up from school before she could enroll him latchkey. So a school mom agreed to take GS home until I could come get him after work. No problem. \n\nThen school mom decided without warning I needed to get GS at 4:00 (I am offline at 5:00), so now my daughter is telling me I need to leave work early with no notice and drive across town to get the kid. \n\nI finally put my foot down and said no and she worked it out on her own. But she did so without any whining or passive aggressive bullshit. She would say, \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do - I need to work\u201d. And I would not react. \n\nShe knew she had ridden the golden train for a very long time and it was now time to pull the brakes. \n\nMy daughter never had a backup plan in case I got sick or if anything came up with the family and I couldn\u2019t watch the kid. In fact, she took advantage of my time as well as my deep affection for my grandson.  She has learned her lesson and now has backup. \n\nShe also knows that when GS is with me, he is safe and loved and that is way more important to her than burning bridges when the odd scheduling (unanticipated or not) comes up. She would never hand me a bill for all the hairdressing tips she lost because she had to miss work to take care of her child. \n\nWhy the hell would you pull a stunt like that, that not only creates conflict with your SIL, but took away that familial, safe stability from your son?  \n\nSend your SIL flowers, apologize profusely, blame it on misguided panic and get a backup plan.", "You screwed yourself forever. Congratulations. YTA and she is not doing you another favor. Good luck finding someone else to take your son. \n\n>I asked her to reconsider reminded her that she made this commitment\n\nShe watches your kid every weekday for five hours a day for free and you have the nerve to pull this. Huh.", "Yta \n\nThe 6 hours of pay is way less than a babysitter would (now *will* because you're being petty) cost you in the long run. \n\nIt's not her job to watch your kid, she doesn't have a contract with you, and frankly doesn't actually *owe* you anything. \n\nYou already said the concert tickets were last minute, so it sounds like she gave you all the forewarning she could, she doesn't have to put her life on hold because *you* have a child.", "YTA OP. She\u2019s providing you with FREE CHILDCARE. She is working for free, sounds like every single day. You\u2019re referring to it as \u201chelping out\u201d to make yourself feel better, but that\u2019s not what this is. Your SIL is allowed to have a life, and honestly you \u201cbilling\u201d her is laughable.

No. \n\nSounds like you need to make other childcare arrangements now.", "Yta sure do that if you want her to not even babysit again.  Is it annoying to have to leave work? Yes. That's why you have a back up plan.\n\nHow much one has she saved you by babysitting all this time?  You send her that venmo request and if I was her I'd send you an invoice for all those hours.", "YTA. Your post is dripping with contempt for your SIL. She\u2019s been watching your kid every school day for at least 5 hours  for free. You should\u2019ve had a back up plan for last minute issues. My mom was a single parent raising me and she had back up plans in case her childcare fell through due to plans or illness. You managed to mess up your childcare by losing your temper.\n\nEDIT TO ADD- OP mentioned in the bot reply that SIL watched her son for free. Sticking with YTA and a DA to boot.", "YTA.

Your sister was inconsiderate for not warning you about her potential concert but you literally attempted to bill her, reducing all her contributions to your family\u2019s security to a dollar value.

On Wednesday she called me while I was already at work to tell me her and her husband got last minute concert tickets so she wouldn't be able to pick him up from school. I was pissed it would be one thing is I knew in advanced and could make other arrangements but she just sprung it on me.\n\nI asked her to reconsider reminded her that she made this commitment and it would be really shitty to break it. She still went to the concert. I have to leave work 6 hours early and lost out on all those hours. I figured since she put me in this spot she should have to recoup me my income is the only thing me and my son survive on.\n\nI sent her a Venmo request for the amount I lost out on. I got a nasty text from her a few minutes later  about how she is not paying it. I had to send my son home with one of his friend yesterday and today because she wont pick him up. I told some of my friends and they are 50/50 on if I should have done it, but I need that income and he made a commitment to me and my son, I think that is more important then going to a concert to get drunk.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

So I'm definitely not disparaging whatever work you're doing. But to be frank with you, you need to find a way to be salaried and have things like sick leave if you're going to be the sole provider for a family with a child. That steady income needs to be used to facilitate a babysitter, nanny, drop off daycare or other childcare. I understand the urge to have your late husband's family help carry the slack left by his tragic passing. But you cannot burden them like this. It's wrong of you to rely solely on this one family for childcare, and outright disrespectful to demand payment when you don't contribute to their helping to raise him in any way. The only real solutions to fixing your issue here is to improve your employment situation such that your hours and pay are stable enough to raise your own kid.", "YTA and really ridiculous. You are seriously burning all of your free babysitting bridges for this.", "So your sister helps you out for free but she should pay you for taking care of your child ? She's been helping you out for god knows how long, on every school day ? I know it was last minute of her but regardless you should treat her significantly better for the help she provides.

This was the most short sighted \u201ccut off your nose to spite your face\u201d action I have seen in a long time. What a stupid, bratty, entitled thing to do. YTA", "YTA. She is doing you a beautiful favor (since it seems like she does not get paid for this time).\n\nIt's unfortunate that you are now a single income household but that is something you need to figure out and I wouldn't recommend burning bridges with people who are trying to help you out.\n\nWhile it was a crappy situation to put you in last minute, she is not your slave and doesn't need to recoup the cost.", "With all the empathy, I have to say YTA. \n\nYou find yourself completely in a new situation and even after few years it's hard to sink in and it might seem unfair that their concert is important than your son. But yes, it is. Their concert is more important than bringing your son from school. They can't stop having fun or living their life to help you. \n\nu/Infinite-Mixture-993, Don't just read any responses. Take a breath and try to find practical solutions. You've a child to take care. Apologise to your sil. Explain your anger is unfair and it clouded your judgement. Tell her that you're grateful that she's been there for you in a way for all this time. Kindly tell that it would be awesome if they can inform their change of plans a little earlier so you can check for alternatives. say that even if they can't it's not their fault because life happens. We aren't perfect. Only you know your trouble. But try to learn from your mistake. Never wallow in self pity, it'll drown you along with your kid.", "... ..... .................\nWhat if she'd send you a payment request for ALL the hours she spends babysitting your kid? \nShe's helping you out for free.

She's allowed to have a life, especially if she's looking after him for free. Suck it up.", "YTA. Come on. You\u2019re getting free babysitting. Your child is YOUR responsibility, not hers. So she shouldn\u2019t have to pay you for you having to miss work. She is entitled to her own life and time.

I hope you figure out child care cause she isn't gonna do it anymore", "YTA. And it's wise to have a backup. A friend of your sons, a neighbor? Could he at least have gotten a ride from another family at your school? How old is your son?", "YTA \nCongratulations on loosing out on free sitter !", "YTA. You're ungrateful and entitled. How about being grateful instead of put upon and jealous?", "Let me get this straight. Your SIL cares for your child FOR FREE during the week for 5 hours every day. She couldn't care for your child one day, and you feel that means she should now PAY YOU? Do you really even need an answer? Get a grip. Is it worth having to find a paid babysitter from now on?", "YTA you owe her way more in babysitting than she does for your 6 little hours. Jfc the entitlement!", "ESH. She has been extremely generous but it\u2019s still rotten to ditch an agreed-upon responsibility at the last minute. And in light of all the free care she provides, yes it was wrong to ask her for money.", "YTA and not too bright either.  You had the audacity to demand payment for your lost time from someone who babysits your kid every day FOR FREE?  If I were her I would counter your venmo with one of my own for payment of babysitting services.\n\n\"I think it is more important that going to a concert to get drunk\"\n\nTo you.  It's your kid.

It wasn't possible to give advanced warning. It's a lot to ask someone to give up their weekday free time 5 days a week, presumably for no pay, indefinitely.\n\nI'm saying this as a 30-something who has done lots of free childcare on a regular basis for family members over the years, not a \"petty 14 year old.\" Yeah... it's unfortunate that the mom had to make last minute plans (though like you said, she should have had a backup--what if there was an emergency situation?) to go get her kid, but this doesn't sound like it's a regular occurrence. It was a one off \"omg last minute concert tickets!!\" and the sister wanted to do something for herself for once. \n\nAnd OP would be in the right to feel frustrated, but her reaction essentially shows that she isn't appreciative of what her sister does for her nor does she realize the absolute magnitude of what her sister is providing for her by doing this. Considering that she didn't mention pay, it's safe to assume she isn't paying the sister here... her sister is saving her hundreds if not thousands per month in childcare, not to mention security of knowing the kid is with family and not strangers, but she throws a fit because of one single day where she had to miss 6 hours of pay?
