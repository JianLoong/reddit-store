We\u2019re excited & terrified at the same time. This does involve my MIL, but I wanted to isolate this one issue. As in, pretend that there isn\u2019t a whole history of said MIL, here \u201cMolly\u201d, jumping over boundaries like she\u2019s one of those buzzed dogs you see in those Westminster agility competitions.\n\nJohn is Molly\u2019s eldest child. He has 2 sisters. This will be our 1st child, & Molly/FIL\u2019s 1st grandchild. I didn\u2019t have an elaborate baby shower, & for reasons I won\u2019t get into, it was mostly with my side of the family/a few friends. Molly did attend briefly & gave me a nice seat thingie (forgive me, I\u2019m not even new at this yet). Very recently, Molly threw me a \u201ccelebration\u201d. She told me it was not a baby shower, it was more like a tea party with her side of the family. I said ok, whatever, I thought it was an attempt to make up for the baby shower shenanigans.\n\nSo by this time, John & I had chosen to name our daughter - & this is a pseudonym - \u201cDaisy May\u201d. We loved how the names clicked together, Daisy was on both our lists, & May - well this is kind of stupid. When I was little, I loved the name May, I named my dolls May, would write stories about May, chose that as my pretend name, etc. It\u2019s silly, but I like connecting that girlhood part of me to my daughter. John loved the idea too. We were going to keep the name secret, but John leaked the first name to his mom (so I had to tell mine). The man keeps lawyer-client secrets like a vault but can\u2019t help but exclaim \u201cOh, it\u2019ll be so cool for Daisy!\u201d in front of his mother. We asked them to keep it close.\n\nWell at this tea party, Molly gave me a large wrapped gift box along with a speech about how it\u2019s a tradition in John\u2019s family that if the eldest son has daughters, the grandmother of those daughters gifts them their middle names. Excuse me, what? I\u2019m surrounded by like 50 women & they\u2019re all nodding Stepfordly. I don\u2019t have the spoons for this, so I just open the box. There are a bunch of blankets & stuff with \u201cDaisy Flora\u201d embroidered on them. So I guess everyone knows the 1st name now. I go through the motions to get to the party\u2019s end. Molly says that I seem upset. I tell her that John didn\u2019t tell me of the tradition & that I want to discuss it with him before saying anything further. Molly was unenthused by my response.\n\nI come home with some thoughts. John was flabbergasted. He\u2019d never heard of this tradition but supposes it\u2019s possible. I told him that while I respect Molly as family, we made a choice as parents, & I loved that choice. I was insistent. We told Molly no to Flora, & she is beyond upset. Here\u2019s the thing, I don\u2019t hate her choice. I know I could actually grow to love Daisy Flora. I feel part of me is refusing to adopt the name because of past resentment towards Molly. It\u2019s just a middle name after all. I\u2019m so used to establishing boundaries that maybe I don\u2019t know when I\u2019m the asshole fencing myself in.\n\n\\*ETA I have since seen some family heirloom things (like this fancy Bible that John's great-grandmother gave to Molly's brother's daughter (her granddaughter) inscribed with something like \"I gift you the middle name Elizabeth\" yada yada) and some other fancy [ancestry.com](https://ancestry.com) stuff so I think it's a legit tradition.
