We\u2019re excited & terrified at the same time. This does involve my MIL, but I wanted to isolate this one issue. As in, pretend that there isn\u2019t a whole history of said MIL, here \u201cMolly\u201d, jumping over boundaries like she\u2019s one of those buzzed dogs you see in those Westminster agility competitions.\n\nJohn is Molly\u2019s eldest child. He has 2 sisters. This will be our 1st child, & Molly/FIL\u2019s 1st grandchild. I didn\u2019t have an elaborate baby shower, & for reasons I won\u2019t get into, it was mostly with my side of the family/a few friends. Molly did attend briefly & gave me a nice seat thingie (forgive me, I\u2019m not even new at this yet). Very recently, Molly threw me a \u201ccelebration\u201d. She told me it was not a baby shower, it was more like a tea party with her side of the family. I said ok, whatever, I thought it was an attempt to make up for the baby shower shenanigans.\n\nSo by this time, John & I had chosen to name our daughter - & this is a pseudonym - \u201cDaisy May\u201d. We loved how the names clicked together, Daisy was on both our lists, & May - well this is kind of stupid. When I was little, I loved the name May, I named my dolls May, would write stories about May, chose that as my pretend name, etc. It\u2019s silly, but I like connecting that girlhood part of me to my daughter. John loved the idea too. We were going to keep the name secret, but John leaked the first name to his mom (so I had to tell mine). The man keeps lawyer-client secrets like a vault but can\u2019t help but exclaim \u201cOh, it\u2019ll be so cool for Daisy!\u201d in front of his mother. We asked them to keep it close.\n\nWell at this tea party, Molly gave me a large wrapped gift box along with a speech about how it\u2019s a tradition in John\u2019s family that if the eldest son has daughters, the grandmother of those daughters gifts them their middle names. Excuse me, what? I\u2019m surrounded by like 50 women & they\u2019re all nodding Stepfordly. I don\u2019t have the spoons for this, so I just open the box. There are a bunch of blankets & stuff with \u201cDaisy Flora\u201d embroidered on them. So I guess everyone knows the 1st name now. I go through the motions to get to the party\u2019s end. Molly says that I seem upset. I tell her that John didn\u2019t tell me of the tradition & that I want to discuss it with him before saying anything further. Molly was unenthused by my response.\n\nI come home with some thoughts. John was flabbergasted. He\u2019d never heard of this tradition but supposes it\u2019s possible. I told him that while I respect Molly as family, we made a choice as parents, & I loved that choice. I was insistent. We told Molly no to Flora, & she is beyond upset. Here\u2019s the thing, I don\u2019t hate her choice. I know I could actually grow to love Daisy Flora. I feel part of me is refusing to adopt the name because of past resentment towards Molly. It\u2019s just a middle name after all. I\u2019m so used to establishing boundaries that maybe I don\u2019t know when I\u2019m the asshole fencing myself in.\n\n\\*ETA I have since seen some family heirloom things (like this fancy Bible that John's great-grandmother gave to Molly's brother's daughter (her granddaughter) inscribed with something like \"I gift you the middle name Elizabeth\" yada yada) and some other fancy [ancestry.com](https://ancestry.com) stuff so I think it's a legit tradition.

She's trying to 'tag' your child as a powerplay. There is no tradition (that your husband has never heard of). That's why she had a tea party to trot you out and dominate you in front of all her cronies. The \"gift\" blanket with her chosen name on it was to make sure you don't forget who's in charge. Don't fall for this.", "NTA. I\u2019ll never understand why any human being thinks they should have say over what another human being names their child. It\u2019s the most self-absorbed concept, and it just blows my mind.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nIt might be a tradition in John's family, doesn't mean you have to follow it.\n\nAt the end of the day, that baby is yours, not MIL. She can make suggestions, give her opinion... but you decide, not her.", "NTA. Please stick with your original name. I let my mother and inlaws bully me out of naming my second child a name I loved and 15 years later I still regret it.", "For me my parents used my dad family name as a surname and my mum's side of the family name as the middle.", "NTA\n\nSounds like the MIL completely made this up since your husband had never heard of it. Just tell her it\u2019s your family\u2019s tradition for the parents to name their kids whatever the fuck they want.", "NTA do NOT give in you will eventually regret it", "NTA", "NTA. It is kind of a charming tradition IF you grow up with it and participate willingly. Like, if you grew up hearing how your grandma gave you your middle name and you always anticipated doing it with your mother.  But it\u2019s a charming tradition specifically because choosing the name of your child is such an intimate, special thing, and asking a grandma to name the child demonstrates that trust and bond.  Plus, part of what makes a tradition a tradition is the shared knowledge of it in the family.  Since it was apparently news to John as well, it\u2019s clearly not a beloved family tradition to him. \n\nHaving a family tradition sprung on you at a shower by being presented with a bunch of personalized stuff is pretty much the opposite of intimate and special.  She tried to railroad you into accepting her choice without doing any of the groundwork, and she must have known that if you had the first name you probably also had the middle name. The fact that it\u2019s a nice name doesn\u2019t matter, because you already have a name you like.  Keep the name you picked. Any social fallout is on her, and honestly her friends probably won\u2019t even remember that the final name is different.\n\nIf you want to throw her a bone you can give little Daisy 2 middle names, but definitely keep \u201cMay\u201d.", "NTA \n\nThe two people that helped make the baby get to name the baby. End of story.", "I'd say NTA, but to defuse the situation, have would you consider giving her two middle names? Daisy May Flora sounds nice enough, and it may avoid drama with the MIL. Admitedly, having two middle names is standard where I'm from, but I realise things might be different culturally for you.\n\nThat said, this could also be setting a precedent of you conceding to your MIL, so if your relationship is already uncomfortable, that may not be something you're interested in doing.\n\nBut at the end of the day, your baby your choice. Everyone and their dog can (and will, probably) give you their two cents on naming, but you and your partner are the only people whose opinion actually matters here. You picked May, and I think you should stick for it since it's clearly important to you. If you want to appease the MIL, a second middle name makes for a nice compromise imo, and can be handy if baby ends up wanting to use a middle name instead (my own parents gave me a first and middle name that are both odd to English speakers, so I personally was very glad to have the 2nd middle name to fall back on)", "NTA - the middle name has been with you practically your whole life and has meaning, which trumps a tradition neither you or husband knew about. \n\nIn the event you are of a mind to make promises to the stepford crew on future daughter names in an attempt to comprise, don\u2019t. Leave the future to itself. \n\nYour turns of phase are hilarious by the way.", "NTA. My mother was pressured into naming me after my paternal grandmother. She and my father had a named picked out for me and my grandmother steamrolled them and somehow my mother was convinced to name me after her mother in law. Many decades later, my mother is still bitter about it. Name your baby the name you chose.", "My middle name and my youngest sister\u2019s name are accidentally family names that go back over 500 years. \n\nThe thing is, my parents had no idea our names had been used by nearly every generation until I went digging into our genealogy. \n\nWe have many, strong female ancestors we share a name with and it\u2019s accidentally awesome. \n\nBut here\u2019s the thing, it was purely accidental. No one begged my parents to name us these names. It just happened. I would\u2019ve been resentful if I\u2019d ever learned members of my family had emotionally blackmailed my parents into giving me a name.\n\nIt\u2019s my long, drawn out way of saying you\u2019re NTA. Stick to your principles and the name you picked out.", "NTA - Jesus, that was pushy of her.", "NTA she\u2019s using this so called \u201ctradition\u201d to manipulate you. Don\u2019t use the name.

You also have a DH problem, you two agreed the name  secret and he went gossiping to his mama.", "One of John\u2019s sisters can use the \u201cgifted name\u201d.", "NTA. If this was a proper tradition, your husband would have been well aware of it. To spring it on you like that, especially not having discussed it with your husband, is firmly in r/JustNoMIL territory.", "NTA You have been robbed. As parents, only you two can name your daughter. I hope this was a great life lesson for your husband.", "Yep, time to start a new tradition!  Parents get to name their kid without family input/pressure.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 love this!!", "agree agree agree. OP will definitely regret it.", "I will regret it and I don\u2019t even know them!", "I will regret it and I don\u2019t even know them!", "Thank you. It really was bizarre that Molly didn't mention the tradition at all before this \"tea party\". We didn't have a gender reveal party, but we found out about 18 weeks and let everyone know by word-of-mouth & a social media post. Why wouldn't she tell us then? Or when John let the first name slip? Which by the way - I really do think was an accident. John came home that day with a long & frantic apology, my favorite flowers, & this specific cheese from a grocery store 45 minutes away from us so he could make me a solid grilled cheese sandwich. Also, I've now seen some family heirloom things that back up the tradition, but her timing of letting me know it (or reminding John - who swears he never remembers hearing it) seems manipulative.", "And I would give away all the embroidered presents as they have a name that's not my child", "Thank you for responding. I did want to write in the post my reasons for choosing the middle name - to show that it did have meaning to me. And I know it is John's and my daughter. We choose her name. But at the same time, if I like the middle name Molly picked - I may have even considered it (I don't know about John) - you don't think I'm being kind of assholey and stubborn not giving in a little for family sake? I don't know. I just wanted things to be different with John's family. I had this big family picture in my head and I hate how things turned out.", "Thank you so much for taking the time to share this story. I am going to show John this. I love the line \"she had the chance to name her own children now it's our time to do the exact same thing\". Molly and John's ancestors had their time to pick their children's names, and the traditions they would and would not follow. Now it's our turn.\n\nIt's funny - I've been pretty successful in establishing and maintaining boundaries with Molly. And John has proven that he has my back, and our nuclear family at his center. So much so, that I've started to almost feel guilty about it. So when this happened, I thought, am I such a brat that I can't let this grandmother have a middle name that I don't even hate? I even likened it to the junior naming tradition - telling myself, it's not like she's even asking me to name my son like William Something, III. So I appreciate your take.", "I posted this comment down below - but thanks for taking the time to read & respond!\n\n......That would be cute, but May & Flora are just pseudonyms.
