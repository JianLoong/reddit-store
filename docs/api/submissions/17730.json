We\u2019re excited & terrified at the same time. This does involve my MIL, but I wanted to isolate this one issue. As in, pretend that there isn\u2019t a whole history of said MIL, here \u201cMolly\u201d, jumping over boundaries like she\u2019s one of those buzzed dogs you see in those Westminster agility competitions.\n\nJohn is Molly\u2019s eldest child. He has 2 sisters. This will be our 1st child, & Molly/FIL\u2019s 1st grandchild. I didn\u2019t have an elaborate baby shower, & for reasons I won\u2019t get into, it was mostly with my side of the family/a few friends. Molly did attend briefly & gave me a nice seat thingie (forgive me, I\u2019m not even new at this yet). Very recently, Molly threw me a \u201ccelebration\u201d. She told me it was not a baby shower, it was more like a tea party with her side of the family. I said ok, whatever, I thought it was an attempt to make up for the baby shower shenanigans.\n\nSo by this time, John & I had chosen to name our daughter - & this is a pseudonym - \u201cDaisy May\u201d. We loved how the names clicked together, Daisy was on both our lists, & May - well this is kind of stupid. When I was little, I loved the name May, I named my dolls May, would write stories about May, chose that as my pretend name, etc. It\u2019s silly, but I like connecting that girlhood part of me to my daughter. John loved the idea too. We were going to keep the name secret, but John leaked the first name to his mom (so I had to tell mine). The man keeps lawyer-client secrets like a vault but can\u2019t help but exclaim \u201cOh, it\u2019ll be so cool for Daisy!\u201d in front of his mother. We asked them to keep it close.\n\nWell at this tea party, Molly gave me a large wrapped gift box along with a speech about how it\u2019s a tradition in John\u2019s family that if the eldest son has daughters, the grandmother of those daughters gifts them their middle names. Excuse me, what? I\u2019m surrounded by like 50 women & they\u2019re all nodding Stepfordly. I don\u2019t have the spoons for this, so I just open the box. There are a bunch of blankets & stuff with \u201cDaisy Flora\u201d embroidered on them. So I guess everyone knows the 1st name now. I go through the motions to get to the party\u2019s end. Molly says that I seem upset. I tell her that John didn\u2019t tell me of the tradition & that I want to discuss it with him before saying anything further. Molly was unenthused by my response.\n\nI come home with some thoughts. John was flabbergasted. He\u2019d never heard of this tradition but supposes it\u2019s possible. I told him that while I respect Molly as family, we made a choice as parents, & I loved that choice. I was insistent. We told Molly no to Flora, & she is beyond upset. Here\u2019s the thing, I don\u2019t hate her choice. I know I could actually grow to love Daisy Flora. I feel part of me is refusing to adopt the name because of past resentment towards Molly. It\u2019s just a middle name after all. I\u2019m so used to establishing boundaries that maybe I don\u2019t know when I\u2019m the asshole fencing myself in.\n\n\\*ETA: I have since seen some family heirloom things (like this fancy Bible that John's great-grandmother gave to Molly's brother's daughter (her granddaughter) inscribed with something like \"I gift you the middle name Elizabeth\" yada yada) and some other fancy [ancestry.com](https://ancestry.com) stuff so I think it's a legit tradition. A weird one, but legit.\n\n\\*\\*Last ETA: From posting this and reading all your insightful (& sometimes downright hilarious) comments, it really made me think about the turn of events. So, I decided to speak with my one decent SIL. She told me, in a whisper that had me feeling like she thought the CIA was tapping the phone, that Molly had expected us to announce \"The Pregnancy\" at one of the family dinners (don't ask) as was usually done, where Molly would have certainly informed us of the tradition. Maybe by a herald. Or Princess Catherine. However, since we did the unforgivable thing of inviting all parents & siblings over for an informal brunch at our home to announce, she did not have the occasion to do so. Moreover, since Molly felt her family was not adequately involved in the baby shower or \"baby preparation events and lack thereof\", she did not feel as though there was an appropriate time and place to announce the tradition & the naming gift other than at the tea party. That she had to plan herself. And fit in at the last minute. All of this is my fault. Apparently her whole family sympathizes. John still swears he never heard of this. I can't with this man of mine...Also 2 middle names are not acceptable. This was brought up during the conversation where we told her no to \"Flora\". Her exact reasoning and logic were not available at that time.", "created_utc": 1684583597, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13mpwb2/aita_for_not_letting_my_motherinlaw_gift_my/", "score": 4531, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Just do it. Trust me! \n- Enjoy it all. Take as many videos and photos as possible. Mine is 4 months and I already miss the newborn size, snuggles, smells and cuddles. \n\n\nAlso, you don\u2019t owe your MIL anything.

You\u2019ll get lots of tips and resources. \n\nAnnnnnnnnnd DONE. Will stop highjacking this post with my baby advice. \n\nNTA", "Totally agree with it being about the how! I feel like if she\u2019d told you before in a rational normal human way. As like something for you to keep in mind you might have picked that name intentionally and felt good about it.

The fact that you even suggested that you may be the bad guy here is sad. This is what happens when you're dealing with a toxic, insufferable personality type.

I called them Mo, Stan, and Happy or Haps.", "I agree with /u/sveji \\- would you care to elaborate on why you disagree?  It's narcissistic because the MIL thinks *her* family tradition should be a central frame of reference for OP's child.  I understand that her son is involved as well, and if her son was able to asexually reproduce it would come off as less narcissistic (at least it's just her family in the picture), but since a new family line (OP) is involved it's incredibly self-centered to so boldly assume that the child would be taking MIL's name in any way.  It's specifically narcissistic vs. just self-centered because I don't think MIL is doing this to be controlling or gain anything from it, I think she truly is suffering to separate her own inward frame of reference from reality, thus narcissism.", "See I wasn't even suble naming my guinea pig, Arsehole.

If their name was basically flower flower or flower plant kids would be dicks about that the second they find out her middle name.\n\nVs Daisy May at most they'd probably get jokes about Daisy from the Mario series or flowers in general.

Why not \u2018all\u2019 sons? Why is it only if he has a daughter? Why was she not excited to speak to the new parents about it before? Why did she not say that she would think I a good middle name when she learned the first name? Why has she not asked what the first name is already so she could start thinking?

I grew up north but grandparents were all southern so big disconnects on account of expectations that were never communicated.", "It does not surprise me that your husband has no clue about a family tradition. Men are clueless about some of the most obvious things and I say that in the most loving way. Their brains are truly wired different  and different is good, but that allows for things like this happen. I love the idea of a family tradition to maintain, but I am right there with you on not wanting to appease Molly. She sounds annoying, condescending and disrespectful to you as a new mom. You need to draw your line in the sand with her. It doesn\u2019t have to be the name, but she needs to know this is your baby and her advice/ideas are not the ultimate decision.

The idea that somebody is trying to tell you how to name your child based on a tradition that apparently neither of you knew about is well....   way more than too overbearing actually. You should tell them you have a family tradition of liberty and freedom of choice.", "She sounds like my SO\u2019s mom. She was so mad when we gave our daughter my mom\u2019s middle name and thought we should have considered her middle name. I hadn\u2019t seen or spoken to the woman in 6 or 7 years by the time I was pregnant, and her own son barely speaks to her 2 or 3 times a year and was horribly abusive to him growing up.

Woman didn\u2019t even meet our daughter til last month (she\u2019s almost 4 years old). \n\nAnd get this, I call my daughter by her first and middle name and I always have. She tells my SO after her first day visiting here that I was such a spiteful, hateful thing to be deliberately using her middle name and rubbing her nose in the fact that I named my daughter after my mother and not her. I needed to stop using her middle name around her cause it was just too traumatizing. Just the absolute gall blew my mind. \n\nAnd then there\u2019s his aunt who constantly brought up us naming her Geneva after her dad, Gene. A man I never met and who hated my SO.
