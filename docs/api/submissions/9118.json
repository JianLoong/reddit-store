Your daughter is 17, which is old enough to decide she wants to eat healthier. It doesn\u2019t matter whether or not you think she\u2019s fat or skinny. She\u2019s not asking you for anything, she\u2019s literally just cooking for herself. Why do you have to make it about yourselves and try to shame her for not eating your ribs? And since you already cooked the meal for the rest of the family, why would she ever think to make enough food for everyone?", "YTA\n\nJust from the title you are COMPLETELY unreasonable. If she is cooking her own food, that is a good thing suggesting she is independent and capable & not a problem.", "Out of curiosity, what's wrong with her making her own meals?\n\nI get that in this case you had already made her dinner, and she didn't inform you before hand... and I agree, I'd probably be a little annoyed as well.\n\nBut if she were to just cook for herself, and you leave her out of your dinner plans in the future...  I see nothing wrong with that.   As long as she sticks to it.", "YTA. Your other kids getting jealous is your problem, not hers.\n\nShe isn't being disrespectful at all. She wants to eat healthier. She didn't ask you to do any more work than you already are. She's taking care of herself.\n\nIf you or your other kids think what she's making looks good, ask her if she would be willing to cook for everyone sometime. But don't force her to choose between eating what you make and cooking for the entire family. That's very unreasonable of you.\n\nIt sounds like she inadvertently hurt your feelings by not wanting to eat what you cooked. If so, you need to get over it. She wasn't trying to insult your cooking.", "YTA here as she is a 17 year old making her own meal. You and her dad have to cook either way. You aren't cooking it for her. She's making her own healthy thing. Good on her.", "YTA\n\nWhy is it such a big deal if she just cooks a meal for herself? Are you TRYING to fling her headfirst into an eating disorder - because this shit, that's how you get a kid with an eating disorder.", "YTA you have a teenager taking responsibility for her health and cooking independently for herself. Not only is that a good thing, but it gives you an opportunity to make sure she is eating healthy and not engaging in fad diets.  It isn't personal- she isn't commenting on your food choices.", "YTA Why should she have to eat what you make if she's making her own food and not making you cook a separate meal? Sounds like you have some control issues. I'm sure your other kids don't want to eat strictly healthy. It's less work for you to cook for minus one person.", "**YTA**, for like, ALL the reasons. But let's enumerate them, just for fun:\n\n> She was a pretty junk-food oriented person, but she was not fat by any means (She was actually pretty skinny). \n\nThis is where I knew you were going to be the AH. What does her size have to do with anything? The fact that you were already equating her being skinny with being healthy, tells me everything I need to know about you, and that you don't actually understand anything at all about nutrition or health. Outside of actual extreme weight issues causing medical problems, being \"skinny\" or \"chunky\" is irrelevant to health. Nutrients matter, especially for a growing kid. It's pretty sad that she understands that better than you do.\n\n>Last week, she told me she \"felt gross about herself\" and wanted to start eating healthier/drinking more water/exercising/having an overall healthier lifestyle. I thought that was a great idea and said OK.\n\nIf she told you that she was unhappy with what she was currently eating, and that she wanted to eat healthier, how did you think she was going to do that WITHOUT eating DIFFERENTLY . . . i.e., changing her meal habits?\n\n>\r  \nThis morning, I told her that if she wanted to continue making dinner, she would need to cook for everyone. \n\nWhy? I'm genuinely curious. This is clearly a punishment. It has never been her responsibility to cook for the whole family. The only reason she's cooking for herself is that she wants to change HER OWN diet. Why are you punishing her for that by adding significantly to her household responsibilities?\n\n>Otherwise, she had to eat what we made (It was ribs, and not unhealthy by any means). \n\nAgain, why? Truly wondering what your justification for this is. First of all, red meat, traditionally made with some sort of sweet sauce, IS relatively unhealthy. I mean, I'd eat it, but it's definitely not something that any doctor would recommend for someone trying to cook more nutritious meals for themselves. So you're objectively full of crap and already trying to ACTIVELY SABOTAGE YOUR OWN KID'S EFFORTS TO EAT MORE HEALTHFULLY.\n\nSo again, why is that? Are you feeling shamed that you don't cook healthier meals for the rest of the family? But you don't actually WANT to learn new recipes, so you figure you'll just dump it on the teenager? Or are you trying to make it so difficult for her that she'll just give up and start eating whatever you make again?\n\nLike . . . I'm truly wondering how you're justifying any of this to yourself because it's open sabotage, and from where I'm sitting as someone probably older than you, you seem to not want your smart, responsible kid who is trying to do right by herself to do that.\n\n> all she said was that she was going to eat healthier, not that she was going to make her own meals.\n\nSo . . . you thought she was going to magically \"eat healthier\" while still eating THE EXACT SAME THINGS that you'd been cooking all along? Make that make sense. \n\nOh, and that bit about not buying \"supplies\" for her? Also ridiculous nonsense. You already buy food for her, along with the rest of the family. It's literally your legal responsibility as her parent. She's not asking you to do anything different than you already do. She's just asking to cook HER PORTION of the groceries herself from now on. Even if she's asking you to buy slightly different things for her, you're buying lesser amounts of everything else you're cooking, so saving money on those. \n\nYou don't have a leg to stand on, and YTA.", "YTA and ribs are extremely fatty and definitely NOT a healthy choice. No one says I\u2019m gonna be healthy and eat ribs!!  Once you add sauces it is high in sugar & salt too. \n\nRibs 3oz 299 calories, 24gms fat (10gms of saturated artery clogging fat)\n\nSkinless chicken breast 3oz 92 calories, 1gm fat, 0.3gms of saturated fat\n\nAnd 3 oz is the size of a deck of cards so imagine the amount of fat in the portions your family ate.", "YTA\n\nThis is such a weird controlling thing that doesn't need to be causing issues. \n\nAs a parent you should be encouraging not controlling when there is nothing wrong. How about you talk with her about cooking 2 healthy meals for the entire family a week and show excitement and help? And then she can eat leftoversnif she doesn't like what you made. Or whatever. The are hundreds of positive ways to go about this and you take some bizarre stand of being mad she didn't follow some confusing rule you never explained to her so she didn't even know existed and throw up roadblock to her excitement. Icky.", "YTA, just pack up the leftover ribs and eat them the next day. Let your daughter cook for herself. Sounds like she is very responsible", "YTA. \n\n1- I hope you clarified when she expressed her insecurities that she was NOT gross even if she had a \"junky diet\".  Awesome, support her new health kick, it's great! But make sure she knows she's perfect and beautiful and that she should be changing her diet and habits for her long term health goals and not to look better or change her appearance. \n\n2- Ribs are actually not that healthy especially if you're adding sugary processed sauces. And in my experience, it's generally frowned upon to push your dietary habits on others. If anything she was just being polite by not expecting you to cook to her needs and you should be applauding her for her independence in making her own meal set to her own dietary preferences. \n\nThis was a failed opportunity to praise her for being so adult, mature, and independent :/", "Oh no a teenager interested in taking care of herself, and cooking? The horror! \n\nI do kind of wonder where she learned this behavior. She must have a positive role model at school or something. Does she also, *gasp*, do her own laundry? You poor things.

Why should she be responsible for cooking for everyone just because she wants to make something different for herself?

Just make less, deducting a serving for her, and tell her she's now responsible for her own meals.", "YTA\n\nIf her food is good, make a deal where you'll buy the food if she cooks it for the family, or something. You could even straight up pay her for her services. You should be encouraging this, it's great.", "YTA - she needs to grow up and manage her own food anyways why are you not taking this as an opportunity? Let her make decisions about her own body and what goes into it.", "YTA. She isn\u2019t asking you to cook a different meal for her, she is taking charge, being independent and doing it herself. You could tell her that you\u2019d like to be asked if anyone else wants to eat her food, but in this case you all had dinner already so she probably didn\u2019t need to!", "YTA, I think. Unless there\u2019s some good reason I\u2019m missing for why this bothered you so much that I\u2019m missing? Your daughter has decided to eat differently than she\u2019s been eating and when the meal you cooked didn\u2019t fit into that, she took it on herself to cook an alternative instead of inconveniencing you by asking her to make her something else. That seems like a great outcome across the board to me.\n\nSounds like you need to sit down as a family and figure out what it means for her to have some dietary restrictions, even self imposed ones. Some chicken breasts in the fridge but she\u2019ll still enjoy the vegetable sides? Some extra frozen veggies in the freezer if she\u2019s trying to cut down on starch? There has to be a way to figure this out in a way that works for everybody, but getting angry at your daughter for taking responsibility for her own dinner is not it. And besides, 17 is a hard age and food, eating, and weight are touchy issue. The last thing you want is for your daughter to not be open about her eating habits with her family.", "YTA, a little support giving she is trying to improve her health would be good. Maybe you should talk better to her instead and organize things to collaborate instead of reprimanding.", "YTA - she made herself something she would prefer, there is nothing wrong with that.

I know people who can eat a gallon of ice cream a day and eat nothing but fast food and frozen meals, and usually it\u2019s because that\u2019s what they were given as kids."]}
