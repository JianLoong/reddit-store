Several people have quite rightly pointed out that this is not an acceptable term and the correct use is \"person with Down's (or Down) Syndrome\".  This was a careless mistake on my part as I did not intend to be disrespectful and I'm sorry for the offence it has caused.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was on holiday with my husband and our two young boys and we had sat down outside at our favourite cafe ready to order lunch.  A man sat down at our table next to the boys and casually started a conversation with them, largely ignoring the adults, his focus entirely on our children.\n\nAt first I was confused, especially since he inserted himself into our table with such easy familiarity that I spent several moments trying to remember who he was and where we knew him from.  Then, realising that the man was actually a complete random stranger, I sat dumbfounded a while longer at the serious breach of social etiquette.  Finally, I grew alarmed at his obvious keen interest towards my children.  I could think of no innocent reason why a strange adult would do this.  My protective maternal instincts started kicking into overdrive.  I was expecting my husband to step in and handle the situation, but he didn't.  So the man sat uninvited at our table and carried on his conversation with my kids while I got silently angrier.\n\nThe possibility of Down's syndrome never crossed my mind.  Any characteristic features on his face were too subtle to notice.  Even my husband, who had grown up knowing a distant relation with Down\u2019s, didn\u2019t spot it in this man.\n\nFinally my patience snapped and I asked the man rather sharply to please leave us alone to enjoy our lunch in peace.  The man immediately apologised very politely and left.\n\nI should add that I am not a friendly person by nature.  Social interactions can make me anxious and stressed and I have often struggled to regulate my emotions.  Thus I was extremely wound up from the encounter and still trying to simmer down some minutes later.\n\nAn irate older woman came storming up to me at our table and started making a scene.  She accused me of upsetting her son, who had Down's Syndrome.  She was loud and angry and drew attention from all the other tables.  She, like us, was on holiday with family and felt their holiday had been spoiled.  For my part, I had no interest in engaging with her or discussing my encounter with her son and only wanted her to go away.  She thrust a card in front of my face, demanding that I should read the information about Down's Syndrome so that I might educate myself and be more understanding next time.  I was in no mood for this and threw the card away, then very firmly told her to \"leave me and my family alone\".  She stared a moment, probably realising that I was as angry as she was, then left.  That was the end of it.\n\nI'm not proud of my angry reactions and I regret upsetting the man with Down's, who in hindsight was simply a lovely, harmless man who wanted to make young friends.  I maintain that I couldn't tell he had Down's or I would not have spoken to him so sharply.  I still would not have allowed a stranger to sit at our table and engage with my kids but I would have spoken to him much more kindly.

Here's the rule I use: If you take disability out of the question, is the behavior inappropriate? If it is, then it's not a disability issue. This is an issue of an unknown adult talking to children. You're NTA, but the man's mom sure is. She had enabled him to break boundaries and then use disability as a defense. It's sad. She's set him up to get into some serious trouble.", "NTA, in fact I'd have told him to go away a lot sooner if it really wasn't that obvious he had Down's, from a normal strange man that would be seriously creepy. And his carers, while I fully appreciate he may be sociable and all, should try and make sure he doesn't bother people, same as parents should for their kids and anyone else.", "NTA - She needed to be aware of what her child was doing, just as you were aware of where yours were.  She dropped the ball and then blamed you for it!", "NTA at all. \n\nHad someone similar approach me and my dogs recently. \n\nI have one very nervous lab. It took her 8 months of living here to stop weeing when we had visitors come in fear. My boy doesn\u2019t do strangers but is in different. \n\nHe approached us. Waving his arms and making noises. Girl lab hid behind my labs. Males heckles went up he was with his mum so I said that she would have to move him away. \n\nOH HES GOT TO STROKE THEM. \n\nI put my hand up and said firmly NO. \n\nAt this point my girl lab cowered. So I stepped forward so I was between the dogs and this man. \n\nEventually his mother dragged him away but not before calling me all the names under the sun. I told her what I thought of her too. The fact she didn\u2019t recognise the fear in my dogs, or me saying no and acted like he was entitled to stroke them really made me mad and then to give me the attitude.", "NTA. In the given situation, while I think it would be *preferable* to have confronted the man\u2019s actions immediately and less sharply before the situation came to a head, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something that you can avoid if you feel too awkward to be able to deal with this unusual situation smoothly and easily.\n\nObviously the man himself was an absolute innocent in this situation, and it was unfortunate that he was upset; we can\u2019t arrange the world so that innocent people are never upset, however, much as we might like to. \n\nThe asshole here, if any, was the man\u2019s mother. She has a responsibility to protect him while she\u2019s accompanying. If he\u2019s doing something that might be seen as inappropriate, especially if people might not recognise his condition or understand the implications, she should be giving him guidance. She had no right to be angry at you, it was her failure before it was yours.", "Does the mother think it's ok for her son to talk to random people and no one should ever object?  \n\nThis is such an odd way of looking at the world.", "NTA. It\u2019s vastly inappropriate for a strange adult to plop themselves down at another family\u2019s table and start talking to the kids. I would have gotten loud as soon as he sat down.", "NTA. Disabled people are still people that have the capability of doing messed up things, and it\u2019s better to remain safe.", "NTA. I went to school with a kid with Down Syndrome, and then went on to study mental health. These people *can* learn boundaries, and go on to lead fairly normal lives (with a lot of work) and that this man thinks talking to random kids is okay is a massive failure on the part of the people who are supposed to be looking after him. His mother sounds like a colossal asshole, and she should know better. No way in the hell all the doctors and teachers he must have seen in his life *didn\u2019t* tell her the appropriate way to raise her kids. These resources aren\u2019t difficult to find these days.", "NTA,  I don't care what the situation is, don't sit at occupied tables and only talk to the kids. The mother should know better then to let her son wonder around bothering other families.", "NTA. Down Syndrome or not, that's extremely odd behavior. Lit rally, WHO would feel comfortable with some random adult sitting down with you and your family pretty much only talking to your children?", "NTA. DS or not, he was behaving inappropriately. You don\u2019t know him and don\u2019t know what he is like or anything. You had a duty to protect your children. \n\nThe man\u2019s mom sounds like TAH though.", "Question: You say you would have been nicer had you known, but still not let him engage. Why not just be nicer to anyone, and just let them not engage? Down's aside, other cognitive disabilities don't have a classic look.", "Info: Why did you wait until you were ready to explode to address this?  Based on your own description you sat there \"getting angrier and angrier.\"  You silently expected your husband to take care of it, but he didn't.  \n\n\nSo your entire mindset on this was unknown to everyone, until you snapped at the man.  \n\n\nUnless there is some other context, this seems like ESH.  You should have addressed this early on, and in a reasonable way.  That said, the other mom should have been watching her child.   \n\n\nThat's not acceptable behavior either, just allowing one's child to intrude on someone else's space.", "NTA but the man\u2019s mom definitely is!!\n\nShe\u2019s coddled him so much for him to believe he can intrude in people\u2019s spaces and get away with it because down\u2019s syndrome. I know someone who also had visible DS but he knew enough social cues to never have done this. It\u2019s not normal, disability or not, and kudos to you on protecting your kids. The mom should have been keeping an eye on her adult child rather than let him wander off and make himself other people\u2019s problems.", "NTA, just because he has a disability doesn't mean he wasn't crossing boundaries or might not be a concern. People with disabilities aren't all just automatically good people by nature of being disabled. I remember a post on here where a woman was SA'd by her nephew who had intellectual disabilities.
