I picked this one because it has a circuit area, and I\u2019ve only ever done circuit workouts before, so while I\u2019m learning the ropes, I wanted something familiar. \n\nThe circuit area is different from the rest of the gym. The workout is 1 minute per machine and the area is designated for people doing that workout. There are signs posted clearly, there is a timer on a screen on the wall. The rules are there for all to see. Limit: 1 minute per machine.\n\nThe machines aren\u2019t different from the ones in the rest of the gym, so many of the gym goers use the circuit machines when the matching one is occupied. When no one is using the circuit area, this doesn\u2019t matter and no one tells them not to. But when someone is, they are expected to move off a machine that someone needs to complete their workout. I\u2019ve had to ask people to move a few times, for some I even had to point out the rules, and people typically move without incident.\n\nUntil the other day\u2026 I was doing my workout and a man was using a machine in the middle of the circuit area. I skipped over the machine he was on, hoping he would be done by the time I was done with the other 5-6 machines I would be using. When I was done, he wasn\u2019t, and after glancing over to see if the matching machine was free (it wasn\u2019t) I asked him if he could move for just one minute so I could finish up. He said no. I tried to explain that the area he was in wasn\u2019t for regular workouts, and that I just needed that one machine to complete my workout. He said no again. I pointed out the rule sign and timer, and he started yelling at me, saying he\u2019d been a member however many years and no newbie was going to come in and tell him what he can and can\u2019t use, and called me some names I won\u2019t repeat.\n\nI got a staff member who told him he had to move, and eventually he did, and I used the machine for exactly one minute. I was quite shaken at being screamed at by a grown man in a public place though.\n\nI went home and emailed the gym owner complaining about the man. They replied and said after reviewing the security footage, they have revoked his membership. \n\nMy gym friends say I\u2019m an AH for going that far with it and getting his membership revoked over one minute of workout.", "created_utc": 1681747449, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12pn052/aita_for_getting_someone_banned_from_the_gym_over/", "score": 71, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The gym did that.\n\nYour complaint was justified, and you shouldnt feel responsible for the gyms decision to ban this person over it.", "NTA.  Getting rid of someone who treats the rules with contempt and screams at other gym goers is a good thing.

He went to far and had himself revoked.    There is no way for you to know if it was the employee of the gym who might be required to report the yelling to the owner or if it was your email.   Nor do either of you know how many times this guy has been aggressive to \"newbies\".", "NTA\n\nHe seems to think as a longer term member that the rules don't apply to him. \n\nYou worked around him for several minutes before asking politely and citing clearly signposted rules. Staff had to intervene, to get him to move, that's pretty poor.\n\nThat he got aggressive about it is on him and you were right to complain to the owner. That it got him banned is a consequence of HIS not your behaviour.\n\nWhy are people so keen to protect AHs from the consequences of their own shitty behaviour?", "NTA is not about the minute but his behaviour", "NTA - Rules where there for all to see and you asked nicely first", "NTA. This man sounds like he needs to get off more than just the machine. Maybe the hormones as well, or his high horse as the very least.", "NTA Rules were there, clearly for all to see. Because he didn't follow the rules, action was taken. There are other gyms and other areas to do so.", "Nope NTA. You asked several times and he refused regardless of the very clearly stated rules, and apparently he also called you names for pointing it out to him? Dude should probably invest in a home gym if he's going to be rude and refuse to follow basic rules. \n\nNah your friends are wrong on this one. Good for you for putting him in his place. You shouldn't have to feel uncomfortable or get screamed at by a literal grown man for trying to use a community machine. He can't gatekeep it. \n\nI'd be cautious for a while going forward though. Some people are crazies, and if he had the audacity to get irrationally angry with you in a public setting, then I wouldn't put it past him that he might try to lash out at you. Carry some pepper spray on your way in and out of that gym for quite some time. I don't want to scare you but it's better to be safe than sorry.", "NTA. You reported someone who was violating gym rules and was disrespectful. You didn't revoke his membership, the gym did.", "NTA.

He got *himself* banned for screaming at you and behaving like a child.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t get his membership revoked.

I doubt it would have been revoked if he had just pretended he didn't hear you and had not engaged.", "NTA you didn't get him kicked out \"over a 1 minute workout\" he got himself kicked out for not following the rules AND more importantly,  making such a scene that they could see it on security video.", "NTA\n\nIf he was on it for 72 seconds and you went to management, that would make you a ticky tack AH.\n\nNo reason to not let someone in, particularly in an area designated for in/out work.", "NTA\n\nIf you can't follow the rule of society, you don't get to be a part of that society.

No kidding they don't want him as a member.", "OMG everyone is so freaking soft. He yelled at you and called you names? Who literally cares. YTA.", "ESH. He was out of line but you goaded him.
