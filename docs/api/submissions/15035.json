I picked this one because it has a circuit area, and I\u2019ve only ever done circuit workouts before, so while I\u2019m learning the ropes, I wanted something familiar. \n\nThe circuit area is different from the rest of the gym. The workout is 1 minute per machine and the area is designated for people doing that workout. There are signs posted clearly, there is a timer on a screen on the wall. The rules are there for all to see. Limit: 1 minute per machine.\n\nThe machines aren\u2019t different from the ones in the rest of the gym, so many of the gym goers use the circuit machines when the matching one is occupied. When no one is using the circuit area, this doesn\u2019t matter and no one tells them not to. But when someone is, they are expected to move off a machine that someone needs to complete their workout. I\u2019ve had to ask people to move a few times, for some I even had to point out the rules, and people typically move without incident.\n\nUntil the other day\u2026 I was doing my workout and a man was using a machine in the middle of the circuit area. I skipped over the machine he was on, hoping he would be done by the time I was done with the other 5-6 machines I would be using. When I was done, he wasn\u2019t, and after glancing over to see if the matching machine was free (it wasn\u2019t) I asked him if he could move for just one minute so I could finish up. He said no. I tried to explain that the area he was in wasn\u2019t for regular workouts, and that I just needed that one machine to complete my workout. He said no again. I pointed out the rule sign and timer, and he started yelling at me, saying he\u2019d been a member however many years and no newbie was going to come in and tell him what he can and can\u2019t use, and called me some names I won\u2019t repeat.\n\nI got a staff member who told him he had to move, and eventually he did, and I used the machine for exactly one minute. I was quite shaken at being screamed at by a grown man in a public place though.\n\nI went home and emailed the gym owner complaining about the man. They replied and said after reviewing the security footage, they have revoked his membership. \n\nMy gym friends say I\u2019m an AH for going that far with it and getting his membership revoked over one minute of workout.", "created_utc": 1681747449, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12pn052/aita_for_getting_someone_banned_from_the_gym_over/", "score": 636, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would bet that there was more happening with this member and this wasn't his first complaint. \n\nAlso who cares how long he has been a member. Do some gyms give tenure or something/s", "NTA. He\u2019s the asshole who got what he deserved", "NTA and based off my experience he had it coming. Anyone who says \u201cI\u2019ve been coming here for years\u201d means \u201cI\u2019ve been coming here for years and I\u2019ve been a problem since day 1\u201d.", "NTA. Because GM screamed at was worse than refusing to move IMO. That's frightening.", "NTA\n\nDon't let the door hit your ass, Mr. MakesTheGymAShittyPlaceToWorkOut.", "NTA. He got his own membership revoked due to his actions. You were just the unfortunate recipient of his rudeness.", "Nope, NTA.", "NTA NTA NTA. I\u2019m sorry this happened to you op. Rules are rules homies", "Nah you gucci", "Nta....the gym may not have shared if there were other incidents.", "NTA No gym is going to ban j for machine overuse one time he had to abuse it in the past. And 2 His behavior to you may have seemed so overtly abusive that they decided to cut his rude belligerent butt.", "NTA. He though was.", "NTA His screaming was unnecessary and he deserved getting it revoked", "NTA", "Yeh if the guy had just said \"No\" and ignored her he might have just got a talking to the next time he came in.", "Speaking as someone who works with clients, I can almost guarantee they've had issues with him before and were waiting for an excuse.\n\nSome clients are just assholes and you're waiting for an chance to fire them.", "No gym owner wants a single guy who chooses to cause a scene and scare away other gym members.", "I'm guessing this was Planet Fitness, and PF has a huge culture around non-aggressive behavior and a ton of rules to back it up.  They make their money off Marketing that they are a non intimidating place that doesn't hold any toxic gym culture- they do not want a big scene. \n\nEven if it wasn't planet fitness- if someone is going to be belligerent and yell at fellow gym goers they are gonna be a nightmare for managers and employees to deal with - employees are always eager to get rid if the problem children and a good manager will too.  No one wants to have to call the police.", "From his reaction i doubt this was the first issue they had with him", "If he was such a long term member he has no excuse not to know the rules!  I hate it when people (most often women) are blamed for \u00ab\u00a0getting someone in trouble\u00a0\u00bb as of it wasn\u2019t that person\u2019s behaviour or decisions that caused the issue in the first place!", "I would wager this was not the first negative interaction the other person had in the gym. You did the right thing OP.", "Adding to thus and the grown adult who chose to yell and call a complete stranger names. Hold the offender accountable too.", "It\u2019s also not just \u201cone minute of workout\u201d it\u2019s the rhythm of their whole system. Once someone breaks the seal, others will join and the flow is ruined.", "Yeah completely agree, I bet the gym owner is glad u brought it up instead of leaving the gym as I bet he could have driven away business with an attitude like that.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

He could have just ignored  OP. Then the manager would have come over, told him to move and that would have been it.", "Yes this is exactly was I was thinking too. They were happy to let him go. Since he's been a member since X years, you can bet that they know him well.

I can't remember if they have a 1 minute circuit but I think they did.", "It makes me think Planet Fitness too.  They have a 30-minute circuit room that is pretty much as OP described with the same rules and timer.  The one near me is the exact same.", "IKR\n\nYou don't get someone in trouble for reporting it, unless you're *lying*. They get themselves in trouble for *doing* it.
