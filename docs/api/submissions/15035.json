I picked this one because it has a circuit area, and I\u2019ve only ever done circuit workouts before, so while I\u2019m learning the ropes, I wanted something familiar. \n\nThe circuit area is different from the rest of the gym. The workout is 1 minute per machine and the area is designated for people doing that workout. There are signs posted clearly, there is a timer on a screen on the wall. The rules are there for all to see. Limit: 1 minute per machine.\n\nThe machines aren\u2019t different from the ones in the rest of the gym, so many of the gym goers use the circuit machines when the matching one is occupied. When no one is using the circuit area, this doesn\u2019t matter and no one tells them not to. But when someone is, they are expected to move off a machine that someone needs to complete their workout. I\u2019ve had to ask people to move a few times, for some I even had to point out the rules, and people typically move without incident.\n\nUntil the other day\u2026 I was doing my workout and a man was using a machine in the middle of the circuit area. I skipped over the machine he was on, hoping he would be done by the time I was done with the other 5-6 machines I would be using. When I was done, he wasn\u2019t, and after glancing over to see if the matching machine was free (it wasn\u2019t) I asked him if he could move for just one minute so I could finish up. He said no. I tried to explain that the area he was in wasn\u2019t for regular workouts, and that I just needed that one machine to complete my workout. He said no again. I pointed out the rule sign and timer, and he started yelling at me, saying he\u2019d been a member however many years and no newbie was going to come in and tell him what he can and can\u2019t use, and called me some names I won\u2019t repeat.\n\nI got a staff member who told him he had to move, and eventually he did, and I used the machine for exactly one minute. I was quite shaken at being screamed at by a grown man in a public place though.\n\nI went home and emailed the gym owner complaining about the man. They replied and said after reviewing the security footage, they have revoked his membership. \n\nMy gym friends say I\u2019m an AH for going that far with it and getting his membership revoked over one minute of workout.", "created_utc": 1681747449, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12pn052/aita_for_getting_someone_banned_from_the_gym_over/", "score": 6937, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Any encounter in which he feels an inferior is bossing him around or doesn't know squat. Many of us have had awful encounters with trash like him and many women have had trauma related to that type of male. So I am thinking he has literally scared off women since we hold no value for him. \n\nAre any of those \"gym friends\" female? I hope not. To a male, it probably seems like no big deal. But we need to shut that shit DOWN. And men need to start shutting it down by speaking up in defense of women.
