She got very upset and said, \" that's the problem with you, you always underestimate my potential, Jim was right he told me not to tell you.\" I asked why isn't Jim going with you on this road trip?? She said, \"because he said I need to come out of my comfort zone and achieve great things on my own.\" At this point I was furious and I said,\" do you even have any idea how dumb this sounds?, he is supposed to be worried about your safety and he is pushing you to a risky situation. I said that I find your BF sounds so suspecious to me. How come he kept bumping into you everywhere, he looks like a stalker, how come you are planning to marry in private within a year of dating and no one from his family is attending?

Has your sister ever met Jim's family?", "This sounds suspicious, so I'm saying NTA. Jim bumping into her everywhere like a romantic movie, wanting a basic wedding ceremony with no one invited, and especially getting life insurance for future children when they're not even married yet, all raise red flags for me. Unless your sister plans to get pregnant immediately, why should she need to take out life insurance? I assume Jim is the sole beneficiary of this insurance policy?\n\nAnd why not invite close family to their wedding? It won't cost any more to have a few people at the ceremony, and if they want to have a nice dinner at a restaurant afterwards, everyone can pay for themselves and will probably be happy to stump up for the newlyweds too. So how is it a waste of money if they're not going to be paying for anything but the celebrant and their own wedding attire?\n\nI would look into Jim. Who are his family? Has he been married before? If so, what happened to his previous wives? Does he have children? You might want to have a quiet look at his socials and maybe google him if there's something pinging on your internal radar that you can't quite put your finger on.\n\nHonestly, this sounds like the plot of a bad daytime movie. But it's not out of the realms of possibility that Jim's intentions may not be pure. If your sister starts drawing away from you or your family, if she won't stop referring to what Jim says, or is always doing what Jim wants or suggests she should do, it might be a sign that Jim is slowly isolating her from her loved ones.\n\nThe car thing sounds suspicious too. Why is he encouraging a learner driver to take a long road trip when she's so inexperienced? Is he hoping Amy has a bad accident so he can claim on the insurance? \n\nIf you are deeply suspicious you could approach the police. Better safe than sorry. If Jim checks out, and Amy finds out you've done a background check on him, you may lose her. But at least she'll still be alive. If your suspicions are correct, you'll have spared your sister from possible harm. Your relationship with Amy might be damaged, but having a sister who is alive and estranged is better than the alternative.", "NTA\u2026 Law and Order SVU theme of playing in my head..", "Well you're not *not* the asshole...\n\nBut those pieces of information kind of do add up in a weird way.\n\nHow easily can you get a background check on him?", "This one is hard. You make some valid concerns regarding her safety driving on her own when she\u2019s still got just a beginner\u2019s licence. Does this licence allow her to drive alone where you are? Where I am a provisional licence (i.e before you pass the test) means you have to drive accompanied and can\u2019t access the motorways yet. You need to be fully qualified and have passed the test to do that. \n\nHowever, you have ongoing issues with your sister. It sounds like you\u2019ve been overbearing for much of your lives together, not respecting her autonomy, and constantly telling her what to do under the guise of \u201cgiving advice\u201d - and the result is now a reactionary, contentious relationship between the both of you. She doesn\u2019t trust you, and you don\u2019t seem to think she\u2019s capable of making her own decisions. You make her sound like a teenager acting out instead of a 27 year old adult with her own life. Is she truly like that - or is that the lens through which you view her?\n\nAnd now she\u2019s got a bf who might be a great guy, but might be a pretty shady guy actually. But a) she\u2019s never going to listen to your concerns because you\u2019re over dramatic, and have badly mismanaged your relationship with her and b) even we here on Reddit can\u2019t accurately judge and help you because you\u2019re a very unreliable narrator. \n\nWhen she told you her plan, despite its flaws, she was excited and wanted to try it. Instead of saying something like \u201cthat sounds interesting! But I\u2019m concerned about some safety aspects, please can you reassure me\u201d you said \u201cno don\u2019t do that, it\u2019s a stupid idea\u201d - can you see how these come across as different? You yourself have been telling her to travel, enjoy her life, try new things, take opportunities you didn\u2019t have - but apparently you only mean the ones that you\u2019ve picked for her.\n\nYou may have good intentions, but intentions don\u2019t actually count for much. Ultimately, what you intend is less important than how you\u2019ve made another person feel. Even on your previous post you keep talking about how you were just \u201cover-protective\u201d and how \u201cyou never nagged her, only told her minor things\u201d. How does any of that matter if you\u2019ve made her *feel* nagged and harassed? \n\nSo I think NAH for your concern over her driving trip, and for your (more reasonable) worries over Jim - but Y T A overall. You\u2019ve created your problems here by your overbearing behaviour. You haven\u2019t reflected on your issues. You\u2019ve said things went \u201cback to normal between you both\u201d after your last post and clearly haven\u2019t stopped to think about how your \u201cnormal\u201d was actually not very healthy or peaceful.

Look, I don't want to downplay the reality that some relationships are bad. But your post REEKS of unmanaged anxiety. You've spiraled from \"I'm worried about my sister on a road trip\" to *your fiance is stalking and planning to murder you* in a short paragraph. You understand that is a completely nuclear accusation, right? You realize that your sister is a 27 year old woman and that 27 year old women are perfectly capable of driving themselves down a freeway, right? Like, sure, if I knew my sister was taking a long road trip I would worry for her, but I would also understand that she's an adult and it's ridiculous of me to try to control her like that. \n\nI think you need to manage your own fears instead of emotion-vomiting them all over your sister.", "YTA. You're taking a lot of individual things and making a massive leap.

If they like similar things yeah they could run into each other quite a lot randomly. \n\nA year is a reasonable amount of time for a relationship to progress to marriage \n\nA small ceremony is not uncommon. Maybe they both feel it'll be easier without hovering family who like to share their uninvited opinions on everything?\n\nThe life insurance... Eh.

He sounds like he is trying to get your sister to shed the shell she somehow has that you keep trying to keep in place. Jim was totally right: she should not have told you.  Part of the driving experience is going on your first long distance road trip by yourself. Part of being an adult is realizing that you can do things on your own without help from others, but asking for help when you need it. You could have offered help and support but you told her to just not do it because to you it sounded stupid and risky.

If you two have had issues in the past about you giving her unsolicited advice I\u2019m sure she feels really judged by you and has her guard up - so the minute that you give her advice (even if it\u2019s genuine) she immediately becomes defensive. If you want to remedy this you\u2019re going to have to take a step back and seriously reconsider your tone and approach, otherwise she\u2019s never going to listen to you.
