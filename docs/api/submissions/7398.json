I say this because we just moved and for them to pack and disassemble/ reassemble it only cost 910 ( we live in the same city as her) after that she literally asked him to pay her first month rent/ deposit and he ended up paying her rent for a couple of months till he told me and i was so upset.\n\nIt\u2019s so rude and disrespectful, might I add she\u2019s married her husband lives in Africa so a long distance marriage.

Well the RESPONSIBLE adult wouldn\u2019t go on a trip they can\u2019t afford :) . especially when she\u2019s supposed to be going to africa for 3 months after this trip??? It\u2019s like stop LIEING we\u2019re not a bank \n\nand i\u2019ve been saying this over a year because i can\u2019t stand her entitled attitude like she thinks he owes her it\u2019s disgusting.

Full disclosure that I'm also not sure about some of your examples, because (for instance) movers can absolutely cost 2k easily. We just moved my niece from one side of town to the other and the prices are so high. But I digress. \n\nI don't think you're TA for asking your husband to make changes. But telling him to just stop cold turkey obviously isn't working. Can you sit him down and ask that you two put together a budget for how much you'll give MIL every month? Because it sounds like she's nickel-and-diming him and it's adding up and he's not seeing it. \n\nIf he won't work out a budget with a set limit, the only other thing you can do is start tracking the money that goes to her and then present the numbers to him so that he sees just how much it's all adding up to. And if he won't listen to that... then you have a husband-problem and not a MIL-problem. \n\nINFO: Does she have an income to pay for her rent?", "NTA, but\u2026 this is why 35 year olds marry 23 year olds\u2026 because no one their own age would put up with this bullshit, or would have found out what type of person they were before getting this deep.", "Just wondering at what age did he begin grooming you?", "She is getting scammed and you guys are funding it", "NTA.\n\nWtf, she doesn't even say thank you?!?!?!?

Everything he gives to his mom comes out of his private account.\nAnd start keeping track of all the different times he gives money to her, even small stuff like a drink at starbucks or smth..\n\nAlso bring up why his mom gets all this support, but you have parents too? Where is their money?", "NTA, you should be concerned. But if they are African, there\u2019s not much you can do about it. Complaining would also make you seem selfish. In most African traditions, once children, often male children, can afford to care for their parents, it\u2019s their responsibility. This doesn\u2019t matter if the parents are still employed or have some source of income. If your husband makes the most money, he\u2019ll be the one to give his mother money anytime she asks.

Do you really expect to join a relationship with someone at a different stage in their lives and then try to tell him what he can spend his money on after he has been doing it probably since you were 13..? No, he should dismiss you but you cant seriously expect him to just cut his mom off especially if he makes good money. This is a battle you will lose if you want to continue being married to him.", "Info: do you both earn an income and have shared finances?", "Separate your finances. Only keep a common one for shared expenses, and another one for savings (for a house or a car etc ...). Have this conversation with him, agree to those terms so none of you will touch this money. And then let him see how much he will have compared to you at the end of the month.", "How do you think MIL will feel if something happens and you can't pay? \n\nHow old is she? If she lives to an average age, what will the $ be, if you continue supporting her as you do now? \n\nIf her husband moves in with her, what will happen financially?\n\nWill this impact on your future? The future of your children, if you want them? Are there causes you'd like to invest in that you can't? \n\nIt sounds like MIL has mental health stuff going on, or something undiagnosed. Would your husband pay for therapy for her rather than all the incentals? \n\nYou really want firm boundaries here. If $0 isn't an option, an allowance with NO wriggle room to help her learn might work. I suspect this isn't the only case of boundary crossing and blame shifting. Your husband has probably been a victim of this his whole life and will need support to see what's happening isn't right.
