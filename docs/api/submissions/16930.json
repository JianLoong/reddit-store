{"id": 16930, "submission_id": "13e7w1d", "title": "AITA for wanting to travel while my boyfriend is on vacation with his family?", "selftext": "My bf (28M) and I (27F) have been together for 1.5 years. He's an only child and only son from South Asia so he is highly doted on. His parents are constantly seeking his attention via texts, calls, and video chats before and after work, before bed, and weekends. We live in my country (Western) and he's been living away from them for 5 years now so I understand how much his parents must miss him. I learnt my lesson once when I got annoyed when we were going out of town on the weekend and he was on call with them the whole way in another language. He lashes out saying he cannot manage both his parents and me, since I also need attention.\n\nWe visited his parents end of last year for almost a month. He kept fighting with me because apparently I was taking his time away from spending it with his parents. I followed all plans they created - I had no input because they wanted to plan. I paid for whatever I needed to pay for. I was blamed for him not having enough 1 on 1 time with his parents when I was invited to visit his country and family in the first place.\u00a0\n\nThis year, we were planning on a holiday by ourselves. We've talked about how his parents want to travel too and I suggested we can half our vacation days for each trip - 1 with them, 1 for us. They haven't travelled and my bf feels obliged to give back as they've waited for him to be an adult earning money. Last month, he decided to visit his parents at the end of this year and told me he doesn't want me to come since he won't be able to manage his time with both his parents and myself. He took all 5 weeks vacation days so there would be no vacation days available for him to take with me this year. My bf is funding the entire trip and his mum has been begging him to take her to Dubai and Singapore.\n\nI started looking into group holiday packages in Europe during his time away. I wanted group travel as I felt it would be safer for me than being alone in foreign places. I told him about my plans and he said I wasn't allowed to go on the group travel as he was scared of me cheating, and that I wasn't allowed to go to Europe as he wants to go to Europe with me. I looked at other options like South Korea and Japan as a solo traveller rather than a group. He said he doesn't want me to travel even alone because it would ruin his time with his parents if he keeps thinking about me travelling and possibly cheating (his ex-gf cheated when she went on holiday without him).\u00a0\n\nI asked him if we can go to Europe next year together, but he could not give me a confident answer. I've decided to travel both Japan and South Korea and took leave from work. My bf is upset with me but I said I feel it's wrong of him to push me out of travel plans and do what his mum wants and then to tell me I'm not allowed to travel without him. He said it's not the same as he will be with his parents but I will be with other people.

You even came up with a compromise where you could have separate trips and one together, but he's being kinda unfair by not allowing you to go alone or with a group.\n\nTrust is a big deal in relationships, and it's not fair for him to assume you'll cheat just because his ex did. His insecurities shouldnt control what you do or where you go. It's about finding a balance between spending time with family and doing your own thing.\n\nYou've tried to work things out and find other options, but it seems like he's more focused on what his parents want than on what you want.

You love him, it\u2019s not reciprocated.", "NTA in any way unless, but run from the red \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9. You do NOT want to keep this boy in your life.", "NTA, but you need to move out while he is away.  He does not trust you but he will be around all of his old friends (including female), he will be around his controlling parents that may introduce him to the \"right woman-one from his own country\"  He expects you to sit home alone for five weeks waiting for him to come home.  Get out Get out.  Also for your vacation search Solo Female Traveler Tours\" There are a lot of great ones out there that put safety for single women high on their list.", "Uh\u2026 does your boyfriend even like you? \n\nOne point - He has no say about Europe, because he had the opportunity to go with you this time, and chose not to. \n\nAnyway. I can\u2019t figure out why you put up with literally ANY of this, but you\u2019re NTA.", " NTA\nrun from him, do it now, you already know he\u2019s not a good partner you\u2019re just trying to be nice about it. stop that.", "Eeeeek. NTA. There are really great guys out there who won\u2019t be controlling and would think it\u2019s great you want to go to Europe whilst he is away for five weeks.", "NTA.  But everything you have described are huge red flags.  You should not continue in a relationship with your bf, he is already showing you how controlling he is.", "NTA\n\nHe's showing you who he is. His priority is his parents, not you. You will never be number one in his eyes. \n\nHonestly, when he goes on his vacation, I would move out and go traveling.", "NTA but you deserve so much better than a bf who puts you 3 or 4 on his priority list.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nHoney, you deserve better. He is treating you like crap. Move on from him. He's holding you back from life and being a dick on top of it.", "And he actively resents her for the scraps he throws her", "As a younger married south Asian man, I second this. I\u2019ve seen this story before.\n\nHe is a control freak and is too immature to be in a serious relationship. He lets his parents walk all over him, then takes it out on you. Do you enjoy being second fiddle to a bunch of immature maniacs? If not, leave him.", "being mad at her for existing during vacation with his family, calls with his family, anytime his family wants attention, existing when he is away with family without her, not 'allowing' her to do shit because \"i want to do that with you someday! but maybe never it depends on what my parents want\". yeah this kid is not ready for a real adult relationship", "Yes this. Let his mummy and daddy have him. He sounds like garbage water.", "That jumped out at me the most too. These are two grown humans in their late 20s and he thinks it's acceptable to say she isn't **allowed** to go to an entire continent because he too would like to visit that continent? And the root of all of this seems to be his paranoia that she'll cheat on him because an ex cheated on him. Either of those should be deal breakers, let alone his inability to balance a romantic relationship with his parents' needs.", "Yes, OP, he's waving ALL the \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "besides, his parents could've set him up with a nice marriagable girl from back home. wouldn't that be fun if after sitting home alone for 5 weeks because your bf didn't want you to go anywhere because you might cheat, to see him return with his new wife?", "together for only a year and a half too! no ring, no babies, no mention of living together, OP should get out of this sham of a relationship asap, unless she wants to be married and controlled by her inlaws forever", "why tour groups?", "This comment isn\u2019t getting enough credit", "OP should use his five weeks absence to find a new place and move out and on.  Or, if their residence was OP\u2019s to start with, pack his things up and put them in storage.  This BF is NOT a keeper!", "Yes! This even makes it worse.\n\nI remember a few years when my husband was in college and working 12-14 hours a day. I'd rarely ever see him but we'd continually message throughout the day, treated our time together as sacred, and looked forward to 3-day weekends spent together. \n\nNow his schedule is better and he's home every night, on weekends, and on holidays. He goes to most appointments when I was pregnant and with our kid.\n\nHe supports me through college and my travels. \n\nBefore we planned on getting pregnant, we each took one trip independently of each other. I went to the west coast for two weeks, taking the Amtrak train down the coastline. He went to an EDM concert in Europe. It was sort of like our last \"hurrah\" before settling down and adding another to our family.", "Travel with a group and a guide is safer for a young woman than traveling alone.", "They\u2019re also a lot of fun. I\u2019ve done 6 tours with G adventures as a solo traveller over the years and they\u2019ve all been amazing. It\u2019s also really nice to not have to plan - basically pick your trip and show up.", "As a woman whos loves travelling solo, she'll be ok on most of Europe as long as she doesn't get drunk or wander in dark empty streets at night.\n\nBesides she's 27, not a teenager. If she feels safer travelling in a group, thats ok, but she doesn't have to be scared of going solo either."]}
