{"id": 16930, "submission_id": "13e7w1d", "title": "AITA for wanting to travel while my boyfriend is on vacation with his family?", "selftext": "My bf (28M) and I (27F) have been together for 1.5 years. He's an only child and only son from South Asia so he is highly doted on. His parents are constantly seeking his attention via texts, calls, and video chats before and after work, before bed, and weekends. We live in my country (Western) and he's been living away from them for 5 years now so I understand how much his parents must miss him. I learnt my lesson once when I got annoyed when we were going out of town on the weekend and he was on call with them the whole way in another language. He lashes out saying he cannot manage both his parents and me, since I also need attention.\n\nWe visited his parents end of last year for almost a month. He kept fighting with me because apparently I was taking his time away from spending it with his parents. I followed all plans they created - I had no input because they wanted to plan. I paid for whatever I needed to pay for. I was blamed for him not having enough 1 on 1 time with his parents when I was invited to visit his country and family in the first place.\u00a0\n\nThis year, we were planning on a holiday by ourselves. We've talked about how his parents want to travel too and I suggested we can half our vacation days for each trip - 1 with them, 1 for us. They haven't travelled and my bf feels obliged to give back as they've waited for him to be an adult earning money. Last month, he decided to visit his parents at the end of this year and told me he doesn't want me to come since he won't be able to manage his time with both his parents and myself. He took all 5 weeks vacation days so there would be no vacation days available for him to take with me this year. My bf is funding the entire trip and his mum has been begging him to take her to Dubai and Singapore.\n\nI started looking into group holiday packages in Europe during his time away. I wanted group travel as I felt it would be safer for me than being alone in foreign places. I told him about my plans and he said I wasn't allowed to go on the group travel as he was scared of me cheating, and that I wasn't allowed to go to Europe as he wants to go to Europe with me. I looked at other options like South Korea and Japan as a solo traveller rather than a group. He said he doesn't want me to travel even alone because it would ruin his time with his parents if he keeps thinking about me travelling and possibly cheating (his ex-gf cheated when she went on holiday without him).\u00a0\n\nI asked him if we can go to Europe next year together, but he could not give me a confident answer. I've decided to travel both Japan and South Korea and took leave from work. My bf is upset with me but I said I feel it's wrong of him to push me out of travel plans and do what his mum wants and then to tell me I'm not allowed to travel without him. He said it's not the same as he will be with his parents but I will be with other people.

He\u2019s allowed to go away for five weeks but you can\u2019t go anywhere because he\u2019s obsessed with the idea that you would cheat? This is ridiculous.

You even came up with a compromise where you could have separate trips and one together, but he's being kinda unfair by not allowing you to go alone or with a group.\n\nTrust is a big deal in relationships, and it's not fair for him to assume you'll cheat just because his ex did. His insecurities shouldnt control what you do or where you go. It's about finding a balance between spending time with family and doing your own thing.\n\nYou've tried to work things out and find other options, but it seems like he's more focused on what his parents want than on what you want.

OP, read this.  Read it again.  Might want to read it to your BF and see how he reacts, because he sounds like he's projecting", "this 100%", "For real this is the only upside of his totally selfish plans.Perfect opportunity to scrub this fool completely.", "NTA. I vote for booking with tour groups. Your bf is too suspicious of you.", "No to all of this, obviously. I get the point you are trying to make, and agree with u. Yeah, he was certainly a jerk about all these things, and definitely has trust issues. But this is the only thing we have heard on this relationship. You think it's fair to completely dismiss him as a posseasive bf who treats his partner like dirt based on just this? \n\nIf that's all he was...no one would be with him in the first place.", "He won't work on them because he doesn't realize that he has trust issues. He thinks this is normal. \n\nBut if the reasons why they got together in the first place are good enough reasons to want to be with him, then op should make him feel safe so that this, or other related things do no become an issue in the future.", "This....is a valid point. This could happen.", "Trust issues are not anyone else's problem. Sure. Unless you love that person. Then that person needs all the help he can get. Cheating is a violation of trust. It is a betrayal. And the feeling of betrayal is the hardest emotion to get over. Even more than grief. If you love him, if he's worth it, help him. That's all i'm saying. \nI also say it because that's what happened to me. Was it worth it for my partner? I dunno. But i sure as heck am very, very grateful.", "True. I read that as if she's paraphrasing.", "I am a woman raised in South Asian culture. Never even left my country other than on vacations. And I WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO ACCEPT BEING TREATED LIKE THIS.\n\nA partner is meant to be part of the family, not some back up plan when you don't have your really family with you.\n\nThe only thing I do understand well and respect is a healthy relationship with your parents (i mean for the most part), wanting to visit and spend time with them. But I still won't be able to understand why that can't happen along with his partner.", "I traveled through some of Europe alone when I was OPs age, and i felt very safe. I stayed in hostels and it was a great way to meet other travelers to explore with. When i went to berlin, my plane landed at midnight so I was a little nervous about it, but when I got out of the subway to walk with my bags the streets were well-lit and there were people everywhere! I highly recommend solo travel, being able to map out my journey and meet people on my own was a real confidence booster", "[removed]", "Please get off AITA and instead ask yourself why you are with this ridiculously controlling, disrespectful, insecure momma's boy?", "Your are shifting the entire responsibility for their relationship onto her. He can't help his special relationship to his family, so she must work around that. He won't realise his insecurities, so she must work around those.\n\nSurly the opposite must be true too. She likes to travel when she can't be with him. Now there must be reasons why he wants to be with him, so it must be on him to work around that.\n\nThe imbalance isn't his bonds to family or insecurity. Every relationship has stuff like that. The imbalance is that when he leaves the expectation is that she remains locked inside as she otherwise might be tempted and cheat. That makes him TA. If he'd supported her choices while he was away I'd have agreed it's a balance they need to figure out.", "She's not going to Europe though.", "apparantly thats the new norm to go by"]}
