{"id": 16930, "submission_id": "13e7w1d", "title": "AITA for wanting to travel while my boyfriend is on vacation with his family?", "selftext": "My bf (28M) and I (27F) have been together for 1.5 years. He's an only child and only son from South Asia so he is highly doted on. His parents are constantly seeking his attention via texts, calls, and video chats before and after work, before bed, and weekends. We live in my country (Western) and he's been living away from them for 5 years now so I understand how much his parents must miss him. I learnt my lesson once when I got annoyed when we were going out of town on the weekend and he was on call with them the whole way in another language. He lashes out saying he cannot manage both his parents and me, since I also need attention.\n\nWe visited his parents end of last year for almost a month. He kept fighting with me because apparently I was taking his time away from spending it with his parents. I followed all plans they created - I had no input because they wanted to plan. I paid for whatever I needed to pay for. I was blamed for him not having enough 1 on 1 time with his parents when I was invited to visit his country and family in the first place.\u00a0\n\nThis year, we were planning on a holiday by ourselves. We've talked about how his parents want to travel too and I suggested we can half our vacation days for each trip - 1 with them, 1 for us. They haven't travelled and my bf feels obliged to give back as they've waited for him to be an adult earning money. Last month, he decided to visit his parents at the end of this year and told me he doesn't want me to come since he won't be able to manage his time with both his parents and myself. He took all 5 weeks vacation days so there would be no vacation days available for him to take with me this year. My bf is funding the entire trip and his mum has been begging him to take her to Dubai and Singapore.\n\nI started looking into group holiday packages in Europe during his time away. I wanted group travel as I felt it would be safer for me than being alone in foreign places. I told him about my plans and he said I wasn't allowed to go on the group travel as he was scared of me cheating, and that I wasn't allowed to go to Europe as he wants to go to Europe with me. I looked at other options like South Korea and Japan as a solo traveller rather than a group. He said he doesn't want me to travel even alone because it would ruin his time with his parents if he keeps thinking about me travelling and possibly cheating (his ex-gf cheated when she went on holiday without him).\u00a0\n\nI asked him if we can go to Europe next year together, but he could not give me a confident answer. I've decided to travel both Japan and South Korea and took leave from work. My bf is upset with me but I said I feel it's wrong of him to push me out of travel plans and do what his mum wants and then to tell me I'm not allowed to travel without him. He said it's not the same as he will be with his parents but I will be with other people.

You even came up with a compromise where you could have separate trips and one together, but he's being kinda unfair by not allowing you to go alone or with a group.\n\nTrust is a big deal in relationships, and it's not fair for him to assume you'll cheat just because his ex did.

It's about finding a balance between spending time with family and doing your own thing.\n\nYou've tried to work things out and find other options, but it seems like he's more focused on what his parents want than on what you want.

Don\u2019t even bother staying with this man is what I would advise, even if he changed (that would be a miracle) his family would absolutely treat you like shit. And believe me you\u2019d be very involved with the family too since our culture likes to have everyone living under the same roof when living nearby and who knows if he plans on moving his parents out to your country or he plans on moving back.

Are they all dying and he's making final arrangements for them and having problems keeping them all sorted?  I get missing your family.  But WTF is he doing \"managing\" both you and them when you are together that is so hard.  I mean, you are at their house, do they cook all day and purposely exclude you?  When you have meals, does the entire table not engage in conversation like normal people and he has to keep one conversation just with you and one with his family?

She also organizes and chaperones one or two trips a year for high school students to Europe or Central America for two weeks and again, sometimes my son goes with, sometimes not (stayed with my wife when he was in elementary and early middle school, with the HS kids in 8th grade and high school).  We take a vacation together (maybe 1 week) every other year.  We like to do different things. She likes the food, and the people watching, and looking at pretty sites.  I like digging into the history and seeing different ways people live and talking people up.  So, it all works for us.  And, most of our close friends split joint and separate vacations to see college friends, go to weddings, seeing concerts that aren't coming locally, etc.  There just isn't any use spending the time and money and extra planning to accommodate both people when only one person is more than casually interested.", "NTA.
