Brad used to treat me like sh\\*t in high school, he was constantly making fun of my weight and calling me offensive nicknames. I can't say I felt good when I learned about his diagnosis, but I didn't shed any tears either.\n\nA few days ago this girl Anna added all of our former classmates to a Messenger chat group, she sent us the GoFundMe link and asked us to donate whatever we could, even if it was a small amount. She also said to send a thumbs up after we have donated. Pretty much all of the people in the group donated, except for me. Anna noticed this and tagged me, asking me if I saw her message. That's when I wrote that I don't plan to donate because of the way Brad treated me in high school. Anna and a few other guys said that I was acting like an asshole, that we are grown-ups now and this stuff is the past.\n\nI left the group because I didn't want to argue with these people. None of them stood up for me when Brad was bullying me and most of them laughed at his dumb jokes.

Brad used to treat me like sh\\*t in high school, he was  constantly making of my weight and calling me offensive nicknames. I can't say I felt good when I learned about his diagnosis, but I didn't shed any tears either.\n\nA few days ago this girl Anna added all of our former classmates to a Messenger chat group, she sent us the GoFundMe link and asked us to donate whatever we could, even if it was a small amount. She also said to send a thumbs up after we have donated. Pretty much all of the people in the group donated, except for me. Anna noticed this and tagged me, asking me if I saw her message. That's when I wrote that I don't plan to donate because of the way Brad treated me in high school. Anna and a few other guys said that I was acting like an asshole, that we are grown-ups now and this stuff is the past. \n\nI left the group because I didn't want to argue with these people. None of them stood up for me when Brad was bullying me and most of them laughed at his dumb jokes. So AITA here?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He was also a child. If karma came for all people who were toxic growing up over half of us would battle cancer in our 20s like this guy.  There is no reason to imply that anyone is battling cancer as a result of karma. None of us know this person.", "[removed]", "Neither is tormenting and bullying someone? Cancer guy is reaping what he sowed.\n\nOP didn't resort to bullying himself by being like \"haha bald cancer ass, I hope you puke yourself inside out!\".

It was refusing a request by someone other than the person with cancer to donate who then tried to publicly shame them for not donating.  They originally didn't say anything until the shaming occurred.  At that point it's no longer peer to peer fundraising efforts and becomes another form of bullying with pushback being more than warranted.", "Isn\u2019t kicking someone when they are down also bullying?  So by OP have to get a dig in against the guy with cancer 8+ years after the original bullying, OP became a bully himself.  Would have been perfectly fine for him to leave to the group and not donate, but by kicking the guy with cancer on his way out, OP was himself a bully.

Please do not use fatphobic phrases or words such as fat. Hurtful language about body image can have significant negative impacts on an individual's mental health and self-esteem. When someone is subjected to derogatory comments about their appearance, they may begin to feel ashamed or embarrassed about their body, leading to feelings of low self-worth and poor body image. This can result in harmful behaviors such as disordered eating or excessive exercising to change their body in an attempt to conform to societal beauty standards. Moreover, hurtful language about body image can also contribute to the development of anxiety and depression, leading to long-term consequences on an individual's mental health. Therefore, it is crucial to promote body positivity and refrain from making negative comments about someone's appearance.
