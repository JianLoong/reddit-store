{"id": 11460, "submission_id": "11i0wu6", "title": "AITA for refusing to touch my nephew?", "selftext": "First of all, sorry for bad English and etc.\n\nNow, my (21F) brother (25M) has a four months old son. His wife is a SAHM, but sometimes she asks for family members to take care of the baby for short periods of time to have a break and relax. The child is my parents first grandson and the first member of the \"new generation\" of the family, so they love the baby very much. I live with my mother. \n\nThe problem is, both me and my mother work from home, but my mother has a lot of online meetings and I have very flexible hours, so last time she decided to take care of the baby, she just left him on my bedroom and came to see him in the interval of her meetings. I don't hate children but I'm not good with them. I'm very sensitive to loud noises, touching other people is unpleasant for me and I have very high anxiety, so I usually avoid small children (I know it's not their fault and I 100% don't get mad at them nor their parents). Besides, I have low immunity and get sick very easily, so it's not good for neither me nor the baby to be close to each other. I talked to my brother and he knows I'm not a good babysitter so he's okay with me supporting them from a distance. \n\nBut I couldn't just leave the baby there so I tried to take care of him. I had to search on YouTube how to do most of the things. And the baby just wouldn't stop crying after more than one hour after I tried everything, feeding, checking the diaper, holding him, singing children's song, getting the toys, like, I tried absolutely everything I could think of, so I just put the baby back on the stroller, layed on the floor and had a complete meltdown. My mother finally came to check the baby and started screaming at me for \"abandoning\" the baby.\n\nSo this time, when my mother told me she would babysit my nephew again, I told her it was fine, but she would have to take a day off work. She said she couldn't because she is saving for a new computer and I told her that either she takes a day off or don't offer to babysit my brother's son, cause if she left him with me again I wouldn't even touch the baby before calling my SIL to come get him. \n\nMy aunt ended up babysitting the baby. My mother is crying and telling me I'm ruining her chances of seeing her grandson with my egoism. She told my brother that I said that she couldn't help because I hate his child so much I that I don't want to touch him, so he's mad at me and I still haven't had the chance to explain. Everyone is mad at me. AITA? I thought I was doing the best for the safety of the baby by refusing to put him at risk in my care.\n\n\n\n\n*UPDATE:* I went to my brother's house as some people suggested and I managed to talk to him and his wife. \n\nApparently, my mother has been distorting the reality for a long time when it's about their son. He was honestly surprised to learn that I had been responsible for taking care of the baby. She said that I made the baby cry and just left him crying until she calmed the baby, since I didn't want to see the child. Since I was feeling bad and didn't came out of my room when my SIL came to get the baby, this got more believable, but my brother didn't confront me immediately cause he knows I'm bad with babies. He told me if he knew he would had never left the baby at our house, since he also knows I'm not trustable with a small baby. He said to me I should have simply told him, and in hindsight, yeah, I should have. \n\nAlso, she's been lying about other stuff. For example, she won't tell me that she is going to see my brother and his family, then she will tell him that I didn't want to go to see him. I'm bad at social cues, so when they tried to pry for reasons without being confrontational my responses were apparently not very good (I didn't even realise this was happening). When he heard that I was trying to prevent the baby from even entering the house it was the last straw. Now he understands and we made peace. In contrast, he is VERY mad with my mother.  \n\nI have no ideia why my mother acted like this. She never did this before (she is quick to get angry, but she never lied or tried to manipulate us like this). I will spend the night at my brother's house and try to talk to her tomorrow, then I will update with the answer.", "created_utc": 1677941309, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11i0wu6/aita_for_refusing_to_touch_my_nephew/", "score": 1093, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Don\u2019t take that shit from her. \nTotally NOT THE ASS HOLE!!", "...I might have to go get reevaluated", ">It\u2019s often missed in women because it presents differently than in men, and because women hide it better\n\nThe same is true for ADHD", "Some symptoms are valid for me, but not all of them. I will talk to my psychologist about it, thank you very much", "Ouch that's an interesting read for me. I relate to around 9/10 of those, I suspected I had something like that when I was younger. Now in my 30's and a happy, successful hermit with a loving partner.", "She has depression since before getting pregnant and my brother works long hours even on most weekends, so she takes care of the house and the baby mostly by herself. I just can't be the one to help her with babysitting, I'm not saying her need for help isn't valid", "I don't think SIL is in the wrong here. Seems like mom volunteered to watch the child. Maybe SIL wanted to get groceries without having to manage her child or maybe she needed some time to clean and organize the house.  Maybe she needed a nap. I think we should normalize the idea that moms deserve breaks too. There is nothing to indicate that SIL knew that OP would be watching the child. Also sounds like this was 3-4 hours 1 time- not like a regular thing.", "Do people like you have relationships with others?", "It sounds like you may have sensory issues that your family is being insensitive towards. NTA, they are for forcing you into a situation you're clearly not comfortable with.", "NTA obviously and that's a heck of an update. Do let us know when you have more, perhaps make a new post", "NTA. How can you babysit if you're working? WFH is just that, working. And you don't have to babysit anyway, you have the right to say NO.", "NTA, I am diagnosed with Autism and my family does not ask me to babysit anymore for the same reasons. I babysat my three-year-old nephew once, and I couldn\u2019t handle it. I also had a meltdown, sobbing and panicking, calling my mom over and over. None of them are angry with me\u2014my sister actually feels bad for asking me knowing I have Autism. So you\u2019re not alone!!!", "Wow.....I'm surprised you don't have permanent tire treads on your body from being thrown under the bus so many times by your mother. If she's so hot to spend time with her grandchild, she has a funny way of showing it. Offering to care for the child and then passing him off to someone else just doesn't sound like she wants to spend time with him. I'm glad you spoke to your brother. And if you can, maybe find your own place. I wouldn't want to be around someone who is so manipulative and dishonest.", "Sounds like it\u2019s time to move and no longer live with your deceptive, manipulative, lying mother. NTA", "NTA - how many breaks do they need?", "I would suggest getting tested for autism and an anxiety disorder. Alot of the stuff you described sounds very similar to me and my diagnoses have made understanding why I do thing and how to improve a lot easier", "NTA. Wow, your mother truly twisted the story. I am really happy things got resolved. But seriously, she gets angry at you, because she won't be able to see her grandchild, but then she also dumps said grandchild on you. What did she want exactly ?", "After reading the update, the mom was lying. Can someone tell me what benefit the mom has in lying and assuming that OP hates the baby?\n\nSorry that you are going through this OP.", "This was my first thought reading this! It often goes undiagnosed in women because people think women are just *weird*", "In your edit you mention that your mom has \"never tried\" to manipulate people before.\n\nLet's be honest, you mention a few different times that you don't always get social cues. Your mother has never been *caught* manipulating people before.\n\nIf at all tolerable, it would be good for you, your brother, and your SIL to get in the habit of bluntly checking in with each other. No polite beating around the bush but also no anger or accusations. \"Hey, did you not come to dinner tonight because you didn't want to? It's cool if true I just wanted to check\". Y'all need to be sure to not let miscommunication put wedges between you.\n\nIt's one thing if you don't want to be around the little one because you're not capable of tolerating their noise right then, but it'd be a shame if you are prevented from hanging out in their house for dinner just because everyone assumed you were properly invited.", "Plus women are pushed to learn how to socialise more, which makes it harder for them to get diagnosed.", "My daughter was on a computer specialism at school, almost ever boy on the course had an autism diagnosis. Yet the small number of girls on course showing very similar symptoms all had social anxiety diagnosis. Because the masking was so tiring, they hated being in social situations. I would like to say this was a while ago, but this was recent.", "Yeah this is incredibly common unfortunately", "If you want to help is there something you could do for her other than watching the baby?  I am thinking something like (with her advance agreement) doing her laundry or helping with grocery shopping?", "I do this already\n\nSome examples are going to the drugstore when my brother was sick, buying their groceries when I'm already buying mine (they pay me back later, though), and I knit as a hobby so I made some baby clothes. I also try to help to clean while I'm in their house, since I read that you should always try to minimize the work on new parents while visiting.", "He needs to cut back his hours then ; because that baby is his responsibility. What would they do if you moved out?", "NTA", "I feel like your mom is lying even more than you think because why would a SAHM leave her young baby with someone who is working? Wouldn't you wait until someone was actually free? NTA to you because wth is your mother doing.", "NTA Good for you for speaking up. Your mother agreed to babysit and then left the child with you. You never agreed to that and by the sound of it are not up to the task anyway, which is a danger to the baby. You are also working. SIL needs to look after her own child.", "NTA. Would a playpen help? Also, why is your mom constantly putting you under the bus? I would have a talk with your mom also.", ">I have no ideia why my mother acted like this. She never did this before (she is quick to get angry, but she never lied or tried to manipulate us like this\n\nPersonality changes are a sign that something medical is going on. Get her help ASAP. She shouldn't be trusted around the baby until you figure out what is wrong with her.", "NTA. Can I just say I\u2019m really proud of you? What an amazing job you did trying your best, advocating for yourself, standing up to your mother, and then going to your brother. Absolutely amazing job. You are a good uncle by expressing your limitations so nephew can be safe. And one day when he\u2019s much older, maybe you can finally connect more. Good job and good luck", "Please do get yourself tested for autism and ADHD, there is so much help, support and information out there and it can help others understand you better.", "I had the exact same thoughts when reading your story. You could try looking into some autism subreddits and maybe looking up some YouTube videos about autism in women. \n\n\nIt's amazing the things you can find out about yourself by doing some research.\n\n\nEdit: side note, autism is inheritable. The chances of one of your parents having it is very high. That's probably not something you need to think about right now because you should really focus on yourself. Just a thought...", "You should check it out and see if it makes sense to you, because a lot of what you were describing is pretty textbook.", "Even if the crying didn't bother you and you were amazing at taking care of the baby it's still not your job to do it, your mother volunteer to look after him, you didn't\n\n\nIf she can't look after the kid then she shouldn't agree to babysit", "Your mother doesn\u2019t want to be a good grandmother. She wants to be *seen to be* a good grandmother. If she had been honest with your brother about how much of the time you were watching baby, your brother wouldn\u2019t have left the baby there so often and\u2014and this is the important part\u2014*people would have heard that grandma wasn\u2019t available to watch the baby*. There\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with a working woman not having time to provide childcare for her grandchild, and probably no one would judge. But it doesn\u2019t fit in your mother\u2019s self image. She wants everyone to know how important she is in holding everything together. I would give some real thought to how many other things you\u2019ve done that she\u2019s taken credit for.", "I know I have ADHD but sometimes I wonder if I'm autistic, since the two are very very similar. I wonder how I could distinguish between the two in myself without an expensive test.", "Ha! A psychiatrist tried to diagnose me with BPD, but I'm pretty well versed in mental health and neurodiversity and knew that was bullshit (she asked me classic BPD manic symptoms like not sleeping, spending lots of money, having lots of sex, of which I've never done). Few years later, guess what, it was ADHD and autism all along.", "Why should OP call CPS? That's an extreme reaction to something his brother doesn't know is happening. I know people hate children here, but good grief, try verbal boundaries before escalating to threats, like freaking adults do.", "And not all people with autism will check every symptom, so your plan of talking with your psych is a good one.", "My daughter is autistic & I have both depression and was diagnosed with social anxiety disorder when I was 17, later diagnosed as GAD. \n\nI don\u2019t have a ton of sensory issues but part of me wonders if I\u2019ve been misdiagnosed. I definitely have inattentive ADHD and that\u2019s been hand waved away for years by professionals. \n\nAnyways all that to say, misdiagnosis is very common for female presenting people.", "Common.", "I was repeatedly diagnosed depressive from about age 13 onwards. Starting at 25, several years of various treatment for BPD (plus anxiety issues and recurring depression) provided very limited progress, but continously had me struggling with requirements like homework and group settings. The trauma-focused treatment I sought at 29 (at the recommendation of the BPD folks) referred me back to BPD treatment as they clearly saw my issues there.\n\nAt 30, I finally landed a therapist who *listened*, inquired further into my recurrent mentions of \"overload\", and finally suggested ADHD testing. Turns out medicating and treating the disorder that's actually there changes quite a few things...\n\nBittersweet punchline: I've outright asked about being tested for ADHD during treatment at least *five years* prior to my actual diagnosis, a few months into BPD treatment. To my absolute non-surprise, it was broadly dismissed in spite of glaringly obvious symptoms right in their therapy environments. Who knows, maybe one day my possible autism suspicions might also turn out confirmed?\n\n\"Wait what\" indeed!", "Or maybe mom is thinking if she forces op to take care of the baby then she'll suddenly become maternal and want her own.", "Then you\u2019re doing great being a supportive sibling and aunt. You\u2019re doing more than most. You\u2019re a good person.", "You sound like a lovely sister/aunt. Your brother, SIL & nephew are lucky to have you", "You\u2019re a very good sibling and auntie!", "That's awesome! You're doing great.  You don't have to watch the baby to help support the parents.  You sound like a big help.\n\nYour Mom's behavior is weird.\n\nNTA", "Financially he may not be able to, babies are expensive.", "NTA\n\nYou 100% sound like you're on the Autism spectrum, OP. Not picking up on social cues, not liking loud noises or touching people? Yeah, that all says ASD to me.\n\nYour mother is treating you cruelly and completely ignoring the fact that you have a disability.\n\nIt's good that you had a conversation with your brother to clear the air with him, but I guarantee your mother's behavior isn't new.", "Thanks for the update. Im proud of you for doing your best with the baby even though you were uncomfotable. You didnt do anything wrong, baby's cry, and sometimes they just want someone else, its not personal.  So glad you talked this out with your brother. Keep talking....\n\nEDIT NTA of course", "NTA.  Why is your mother lying?  Is her grandchild more important than you?  She shouldn't lie like that because she just got found out and made things worse for herself.  Trying to keep you away from family events is just as bad.  OP, find a place to live so you don't have to deal with this.", "NTA. The child wouldn\u2019t stop crying because of how tense you were. The babies feel it and react.  This isn\u2019t something that you can control since you\u2019re not comfortable with kids. Older kids feel it too and also negatively react. You were proactive in getting your brother to understand you\u2019re not one that should be caring for kids. This is a very mature thing to do. In none of this are you wrong. Hopefully you can find a way to explain it to your brother. It also doesn\u2019t mean you hate kids. It only means you can\u2019t be their care giver which you already took steps to ensure that. There\u2019s NOTHING to feel guilty about. It was your mother that dropped the ball caring for your nephew. Hopefully you will take all the NTA\u2019s to heart. I am a mother and now a grandmother. If you were wrong I would tell you.", "OP I just want to comment and say that you've handled this situation about as well as humanly possible   \n\nyou had a baby dumped on you without prior consent or even notice in the middle of your workday. that would be bad regardless. you have no experience with babies and literally no idea what to do   \n\nadditionally you have disabilities that make it very difficult/impossible for you do certain stuff that's generally necessary in childcare. despite that you did everything you possibly could and were googling what you should do  \n\nthis wasn't an emergency situation. a child was dumped on your proverbial lap after your mother made plans to be responsible for the child without ever intending to actually do that work. your mother knew that you literally cannot do childhood care - not just that you didn't want to, but that you couldn't - and dumped a baby in your room anyway. without any instructions or communication or anything. did she even tell you how long she'd be gone??\n\nyour mother was selfish, reckless, lazy, inconsiderate and that's before we get to the part where she's lying and manipulative\n\nyou were the opposite of all of that. you may not be able to take care of this baby but you have been helping their parents in other ways as much as you can. when you had a baby dumped on you in the middle of your work day with no ability to care for them and no knowledge, you did the absolute best that you could, despite significant limitations \n\nyou also seemingly and out of your way to avoid drama and to avoid stressing other people out. for example when your mother dumped the baby on you, you could have called the baby's mom and let her know what was going on and that you were concerned because you can't care for the baby\n\ninstead since it wasn't an emergency and the baby wasn't in danger, you did the best you could on your own\n\nyou have shown vastly more care for this baby and your brother's family than you mother has. you've taken the babies needs and well being seriously and have done your best to act as responsibly as possible in horrible situations you should never have been put in\n\nthat you managed all of this with the grace and fortitude that you did, while having a panic attack? you are incredibly not the asshole here\n\nI'm terribly sorry for how you've been treated", "And how is that OP's problem?
