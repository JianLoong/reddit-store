She seems to think your time and effort, whether or not you have the skills or inclination, are hers to use as she pleases. Her redefining your unwillingness to tackle infant care and related discomfort as \"hating the baby\" and ruining \"her\" time with the baby are illogical and manipulative.\nYou are okay not being \"a baby person.\" Lots of nice people are the same. It's wise that you recognize it's unsafe for unskilled you to be in charge of an infant. Refusing to allow yourself to be pressured into that situation again is an important boundary for your safety, privacy and comfort.\n\nEDIT: Your mom's ignoring the crying baby for over an hour, during the \"short time\" she was \"watching\" it doesn't sound like either her watching baby nor a short time.", "Nta I would text your brother or his wife and explain that you were left abandoned with their baby with no help.", "NTA.

And you being honest about that is the best you can too because in the end, it will not be good for the child either. \n\nThe one thing I think you could have done differently is how you approached this with your mom. Instead of demanding her to take a day off, it would have been better to tell her \"I cannot babysit while the kid is here, are you able to watch him during your meetings? Can you postpone some of the meetings\" Because coming with a demand never works well for these kind of things. \n\nStill, I find your mom's reaction really over the top, and she's the true ahole  here. Like she still gets to spend time with her grandkid, she just needs to plan her own time around this better. What if you would not live at home? Would it then also be your fault. And her telling your brother lies about you. That just sounds super manipulative. \n\nSend a message to your brother to explain.

Explain that your mother offers to babysit but dumps the baby off on you. \n\nOr you could just not bother and everytime someone says something, tell them that your mother isn't tell them the truth.\n\nKeep your door locked so your mother can't just come in and \"abandon\" the baby.
