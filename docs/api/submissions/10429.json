Time to tell her to move on with them.", "NTA\u2026 but perhaps address it politely with the parents as they may see washing dishes as helpful behavior and just not know where things go. My mom sees cleaning as one of the highest forms of service you can do for loved ones and always insists on deep cleaning my place when she visits even when I tell her it\u2019s unnecessary and I just value her company. \n\nAs far as the roommate goes - she is TA. There\u2019s a difference between what it seems like the parents are doing - which is misunderstanding where things get put away and maybe washing cast iron which is a no no for ppl in tue know but not common knowledge for ppl who don\u2019t use them often. - and what she is doing, which is ruining your things without replacing them or asking first whether she can use them.", "NTA but you need a different roommate", "I have a question - why the hell aren't they staying in the RV??  There's no reason at all for them to stay with you when the roommate isn't even there. NTA, and good luck. The whole family sounds oblivious.", "NTA. You should look her in the eyes and remind her that just bc she moved in does not mean she inherited your stuff. Her rent doesn't cover free use of whatever you own, for you or her family. If she didn't purchase it or if you didn't purchase it together it's not hers to use without asking first. Then, separately, do the same with them. You understand that there's a problem and they're there to support their daughter. You are sympathetic to this and open to making the sacrifice of having your private home open to them more than you would normally appreciate, because again, you're sympathetic. But she moved in to your lease, her stuff is hers and yours is yours, she doesn't own the place and doesn't get to make the executive decision not to ask your parents to be more polite and respectful of your property and boundaries. That means cookware, towels, everything you purchased and placed throughout the house she moved into. You are being kind by letting them use your place as home base. The fact that their daughter is renting a room doesn't make everything in the common areas free game. Let them know that they can ask respectfully, but there's nothing that says you have to oblige.\n\nGood luck, it sounds stressful. But it's incredibly important to set firm and clear boundaries. If you don't then it'll lead to bitterness and animosity and a hellish home life 100% of the time. If she reacts poorly then that shows a level of immaturity and disrespect/disregard which may lead me to ask her to start looking for a new place. You're not her best friend or an extension of her family. There's a difference between kindness and a willingness to be taken advantage of.\n\nAlso, your cast iron probably isn't ruined, it just needs to be cleaned and reseasoned. It's really easy. You can do it!", "NTA. You have to set boundaries with all of them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You have a right to autonomy over the space you pay for, and a right to autonomy over your own things.  \n\nBut keep in mind, they may have no idea what stuff is yours and what stuff is your roommates.

You\u2019re the landlord. \n\nIf you want to continue living with her then agree some things in writing. \n\nLike parents can visit for X hours a month and cleaning is XYZ and tenants oay for xxx", "NTA but time to get a new housemate. This one isn't working out.", "NTA. You just need a new roommate. She learned the lack of respect for your belongings from her parents so it's probably not going to be easy to change.", "Agreed! Do they know what\u2019s yours and what\u2019s Ashley\u2019s?", "I have not talked to them about this yet, no. I was just dealing with it before because the visits were more spread out so I decided to swallow it rather than cause any discord.\n\nAs far as the belongings in the apartment - they helped her move in and saw exactly what was here because they stayed for 2 days (furniture, kitchen utensils, etc). I haven't really bought much in the past year that could be considered common.", "I think this is a case you left it so long out of politeness and you now reached your limit\u2026 I would have a quiet word with them about it. Not too forceful, as it\u2019s not their fault you held on to these frustrations for so long. \n\nStarting with \u201cI appreciate how you both always make such an effort to help when you stay, I did want to ask though if\u2026\u201d\n\nNTA", "If you haven't said anything yet then yes, YTA if you start out with telling them not to touch your stuff when literally everything belongs to you. Ask your roommate to purchase specific things if you don't want to share your cleaning supplies.  It sounds like they parents are trying to help by cleaning. The correct way to handle it is to thank them for trying to help and tell them ways they can or cannot help or things that are bothering you. It Isn't healthy to keep everything bottled up and then react in anger by saying \"Don't touch my stuff\". You need to communicate in healthy ways to have healthy relationships!", "This is both extremely helpful and validating. I appreciate it.", "They may also genuinely have no clue that most of the things they are using and touching belong to you, not your roommate.", "NTA - I would start off by talking to Ashley and her parents about not using your things and that she needs to buy her own stuff as she is not renting a furnished apt. If they ask why then give examples of your stuff getting ruined.\n\nIf they continue to ruin your stuff then you need to start showing them and telling them they need to replace it.\n\nAlso, they need to stay in their RV if it's parked close by. You signed up for one roommate but are constantly funding 2 extra people for utilities, etc. It's not right. The hospital thing is a little different but if Ashley isn't sick, they can't just stay as many days as they want.", "NTA. I'm assuming these people are not on the lease in which case I would tell them to get the hell out of there and they won't be allowed to stay overnight again. Screw all this softly, softly spproach - go in hard and fast like a divebomber. I'd be letting Ashley know she'll be on her way out soon too unless she polishes up her act. You do know that everyone is taking advantage of you, stop being a doormat.", "NTA", "My cast iron would set me off! But I would've told them not to touch them the first time they stayed", "NTA but you need to talk to roommate about this currently it\u2019s you and her on a lease. So her parents shouldn\u2019t be staying as if they\u2019d e there\u2026 also I hope roommate had even asked for permission for when they came to visit. \nNext is discussing these issues. This is not their home to be messing with everything and ruin your stuff. Let roommate know they\u2019ll need to pay for the replacements. Also would probably be wise to find a new roommate if this has been a long term issue", "NTA but you need to say something asap. I understand that you're worried about daughter and you're unaware of how I like my things arranged so let me show you. Be polite and make it seem like you're just updating them since you haven't already. Also in the future maybe have a chat with the roommate and say she has to get her own kitchen stuff on separate labeled shelves.", "YWNBTA", "They live in an RV, they don\u2019t need to be in YOUR home.\n\nNTA", "NTA, but if you've not spoken to them before going in softly at first would be best. If they still can't respect your things then you can get more form with them.", "NTA, but I think maybe you should consider trying to find a one bedroom if you can't afford your current place without a roommate.\n\nIt sounds like you are very attached to your stuff, and very specific in regards to how it is used. I understand, I'm like this with a lot of my stuff too.\n\nWhat doesn't work is expecting other people to just intuit these things. Everyone grows up differently, and everyone thinks what they know as normal is *the* normal. If you want to live with someone you need to communicate, but I understand that that can be difficult and frustrating to do.\n\nI struggled with this a lot, and I realized it's just way easier for me to live alone. Everything stays where I put it (unless my cat decides to move it, which is why I got child locks for the cabinets), I can keep my stuff safe as long as I make sure it's out of my cat's reach, and I don't need to explain to someone that they can't use screen cleaner on the OLED TV.", "ESH they have an RV they can stay in.

They know it\u2019s not theirs to tough but they do. Even if, they should ask at the end of the day they are guests.", "It could be a cultural thing. When I was living in a dorm, my roommates' parents and even my own would take to doing the dishes if they saw any in the sink. It didn't matter who they belonged to.", "YWNBTA for asking but I would go directly to her parents about it. Reading this post made me think about my roommates in uni. Our parents would visit and wash our dishes if they saw any in the sink regardless of who brought or used the dishes. In our case, it was more embarrassing than annoying, and we felt bad that they were compelled to clean. I know that cast irons require different cleaning protocols, but a few years ago I did not, so I can attribute this to well meaning ignorance on the parents' part.\n\nIf you mention it and the parents persist, they are the AHs. Your roommate is TA for not stopping her parents from touching your stuff, so I wouldn't count on her relaying the message, hence why I said to tell the parents directly.", "why are they even staying in the apartment. Are they paying rent?", "It sounds like you haven't communicated any of your concerns yet... And as such, I feel like it's a clear NAH.\n\nGo talk to 'em.", "You should have said something the first time they messed with your stuff", "It is a cultural thing. Because I could never go into someone\u2019s home and use things that don\u2019t belong to my friends or my family members.", "I think they are using them then ruining them when they are \u201ccleaning\u201d them.", "Because they may not know what things OP purchased when it comes to cleaning products and so forth. It's also important to remember that their child is in the hospital so they are probably not thinking clearly. So OP should start with *talking to them about the issue* and letting them know the problem. If the problem persists, then OP needs to be forceful, but at this point the parents could just be honestly clueless."]}
