Time to tell her to move on with them.", "NTA\u2026 but perhaps address it politely with the parents as they may see washing dishes as helpful behavior and just not know where things go. My mom sees cleaning as one of the highest forms of service you can do for loved ones and always insists on deep cleaning my place when she visits even when I tell her it\u2019s unnecessary and I just value her company. \n\nAs far as the roommate goes - she is TA. There\u2019s a difference between what it seems like the parents are doing - which is misunderstanding where things get put away and maybe washing cast iron which is a no no for ppl in tue know but not common knowledge for ppl who don\u2019t use them often. - and what she is doing, which is ruining your things without replacing them or asking first whether she can use them.", "NTA but you need a different roommate", "I have a question - why the hell aren't they staying in the RV??  There's no reason at all for them to stay with you when the roommate isn't even there. NTA, and good luck. The whole family sounds oblivious.", "NTA. You should look her in the eyes and remind her that just bc she moved in does not mean she inherited your stuff. Her rent doesn't cover free use of whatever you own, for you or her family. If she didn't purchase it or if you didn't purchase it together it's not hers to use without asking first. Then, separately, do the same with them. You understand that there's a problem and they're there to support their daughter. You are sympathetic to this and open to making the sacrifice of having your private home open to them more than you would normally appreciate, because again, you're sympathetic. But she moved in to your lease, her stuff is hers and yours is yours, she doesn't own the place and doesn't get to make the executive decision not to ask your parents to be more polite and respectful of your property and boundaries. That means cookware, towels, everything you purchased and placed throughout the house she moved into. You are being kind by letting them use your place as home base. The fact that their daughter is renting a room doesn't make everything in the common areas free game. Let them know that they can ask respectfully, but there's nothing that says you have to oblige.\n\nGood luck, it sounds stressful. But it's incredibly important to set firm and clear boundaries. If you don't then it'll lead to bitterness and animosity and a hellish home life 100% of the time. If she reacts poorly then that shows a level of immaturity and disrespect/disregard which may lead me to ask her to start looking for a new place. You're not her best friend or an extension of her family. There's a difference between kindness and a willingness to be taken advantage of.\n\nAlso, your cast iron probably isn't ruined, it just needs to be cleaned and reseasoned. It's really easy. You can do it!", "NTA. You have to set boundaries with all of them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Ask your roommate to purchase specific things if you don't want to share your cleaning supplies.  It sounds like they parents are trying to help by cleaning. The correct way to handle it is to thank them for trying to help and tell them ways they can or cannot help or things that are bothering you. It Isn't healthy to keep everything bottled up and then react in anger by saying \"Don't touch my stuff\". You need to communicate in healthy ways to have healthy relationships!", "This is both extremely helpful and validating. I appreciate it.", "They may also genuinely have no clue that most of the things they are using and touching belong to you, not your roommate.", "NTA - I would start off by talking to Ashley and her parents about not using your things and that she needs to buy her own stuff as she is not renting a furnished apt. If they ask why then give examples of your stuff getting ruined.\n\nIf they continue to ruin your stuff then you need to start showing them and telling them they need to replace it.\n\nAlso, they need to stay in their RV if it's parked close by. You signed up for one roommate but are constantly funding 2 extra people for utilities, etc. It's not right. The hospital thing is a little different but if Ashley isn't sick, they can't just stay as many days as they want.", "NTA. I'm assuming these people are not on the lease in which case I would tell them to get the hell out of there and they won't be allowed to stay overnight again.
