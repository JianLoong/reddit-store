{"id": 14960, "submission_id": "12oi77s", "title": "AITA for not helping my sister pay for her wedding even though I could easily afford it just because of a petty reason?", "selftext": "I (33F) have a younger sister Jamie (31F) who got engaged to her fianc\u00e9 a few months ago and now she\u2019s deep into wedding planning. Our parents gifted us $25,000 each as a wedding present when we got engaged to help with wedding expenses and just help us get started with some savings. For background: I got married 2 years ago to my husband and we practically had little to no expenses. We just did a small wedding ceremony/celebration in my parents backyard and I used my moms old dress so our only expenses were really just food and photography. Due to this, we saved $20,000 of the money we were gifted and just put it into savings.\n\nAlthough my husband and I were happy with our day, Jamie had a lot to say. She practically spent every single family event after the wedding gossiping about how my wedding was so \u201ctrashy and cheap\u201d. I think she expected a lot more from me because I work as a software engineer and my husband is a surgeon, and we could have afforded to have a much nicer wedding.\n\nNow it\u2019s time for her wedding and she has plans to go all out for it for it, which I wouldn\u2019t care about if she could afford it, but instead she has become a greedy bridezilla asking anyone and everyone for cash. My parents refused to give more that the original $25k and other family members have chipped in, but maybe $5k max combined. Unfortunately, my sister knows I saved the $20k from my parents and that my husband and I have a good amount of money saved up because of our salaries.\n\nShe has been asking me nonstop to give her the $20k as a wedding gift or help pay for another one of her events like the bridal shower, bachelorette, rehearsal dinner, or honeymoon. Her reasoning is that my husband and I could easily afford to gift her one of these things and I even gifted my cousin a honeymoon vacation as a wedding gift last year so why couldn\u2019t I do something similar for my only sibling when I did that for a cousin.\n\nShe\u2019s right in the sense that I could easily afford to pay for parts of her wedding, but in all honestly I don\u2019t want to give her anything after she treated me so poorly following my own wedding. I told her my reasoning and that I don\u2019t want to (financially) support someone who didn\u2019t support me on my big day and now she has been going around telling family that I\u2019m extremely selfish and immature for this. Apparently she has already put down deposits on a lot of services and vendors for her plans and just expected me to help pay for it, but now she has no way of paying the vendors and she can\u2019t get her deposits back either. So now my family wants me to help her out so she doesn\u2019t lose the little money she already has. I just don\u2019t see how this is my problem.

Your money is not part of her budget - her money is. And asking you to give her $20K as a gift? Isn't a gift decided on by the gift-giver, not the receiver? Sounds more like choosing beggars if you ask me.\n\nEspecially after trashing your choice to have the wedding you wanted, she's got no room to talk at this point.

You'd think she might have the common sense to realize that calling somebody names isn't the best way to encourage them to feel motivated to give her lavish gifts.

If you reward someone who's irresponsible and treats you like shit, they'll continue to take advantage of you forever.

You spend wisely, so you have savings, then you invest it and get even more, then people ask you to spend your money on unwise things and they're \"surprised\" when you decline.

That's not correlated to how much money is spent. In fact, the more money is spent, the more likely it is that it is done to signal status, which means narcissists are involved, which means there will be drama, and if the event is memorable, it will be for the screaming and not the happy moments... Real intimate connection with people doesn't require large expenses of money.", "Definitely NTA.  Weddings come in all shapes and sizes and costs.  You did what you wanted, which IMHO was really smart.  \n\nYour sister is waaaay out of line, both with her comments of your wedding and her expectations that you give her YOUR money.  Keep it and use it for something for YOU.  Please don't feel obliged to give anything to her, she's all grown up now, can make her own decisions, and will have to live with the consequences.", "NTA. Decide what you are comfortable gifting her and tell her. If she asks for more or asks why you aren\u2019t doing more, tell her exactly why.

Not only for the reason that she talks so poorly about you, but because she wants a wedding she can\u2019t afford! Why should everybody else be expected to fork over money for a wedding that is over her budget. You had a wedding that was affordable. You and your husband decided you\u2019d rather keep the money for something else. Now your sister thinks she\u2019s entitled to that money! I honestly don\u2019t understand why anyone would have a wedding where they go into debt to have it. Especially since most marriages don\u2019t last anyway. And unless you\u2019re rich and can truly afford it having a small wedding that\u2019s within your budget is the intelligent thing to do. it is not your fault she assumed you would help her. Now she\u2019s bad mouthing you once again in an effort to guilt trip you into giving money! This alone would make me double down and not give her anything! Please, OP, do not give in on this. This is her fault, and her fault alone. She is destined to have financial troubles and she will tap into you again if you give in now. I would venture to guess her interest in you is strictly for whatever financial help she can get.", "My dad always said, you can\u2019t spend someone else\u2019s money.
