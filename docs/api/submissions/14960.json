Our parents gifted us $25,000 each as a wedding present when we got engaged to help with wedding expenses and just help us get started with some savings. For background: I got married 2 years ago to my husband and we practically had little to no expenses. We just did a small wedding ceremony/celebration in my parents backyard and I used my moms old dress so our only expenses were really just food and photography. Due to this, we saved $20,000 of the money we were gifted and just put it into savings.\n\nAlthough my husband and I were happy with our day, Jamie had a lot to say. She practically spent every single family event after the wedding gossiping about how my wedding was so \u201ctrashy and cheap\u201d. I think she expected a lot more from me because I work as a software engineer and my husband is a surgeon, and we could have afforded to have a much nicer wedding.\n\nNow it\u2019s time for her wedding and she has plans to go all out for it for it, which I wouldn\u2019t care about if she could afford it, but instead she has become a greedy bridezilla asking anyone and everyone for cash. My parents refused to give more that the original $25k and other family members have chipped in, but maybe $5k max combined. Unfortunately, my sister knows I saved the $20k from my parents and that my husband and I have a good amount of money saved up because of our salaries.\n\nShe has been asking me nonstop to give her the $20k as a wedding gift or help pay for another one of her events like the bridal shower, bachelorette, rehearsal dinner, or honeymoon. Her reasoning is that my husband and I could easily afford to gift her one of these things and I even gifted my cousin a honeymoon vacation as a wedding gift last year so why couldn\u2019t I do something similar for my only sibling when I did that for a cousin.\n\nShe\u2019s right in the sense that I could easily afford to pay for parts of her wedding, but in all honestly I don\u2019t want to give her anything after she treated me so poorly following my own wedding. I told her my reasoning and that I don\u2019t want to (financially) support someone who didn\u2019t support me on my big day and now she has been going around telling family that I\u2019m extremely selfish and immature for this. Apparently she has already put down deposits on a lot of services and vendors for her plans and just expected me to help pay for it, but now she has no way of paying the vendors and she can\u2019t get her deposits back either. So now my family wants me to help her out so she doesn\u2019t lose the little money she already has. I just don\u2019t see how this is my problem.

Don't worry about her decisions for her life.", "> they\u2019re all worried she\u2019s going to go into enormous debt\n\nThey are worried about the reckless impulsiveness of a grown, adult, 30-year old woman who is intent on showing off with money that she does not have?!\n\nThis would be hilarious if it wasn't so ludicrous and manipulative.", "DO NOT bail her out OP. If she gets in debt, it's her fault. She's a grown woman & should be financially responsible.... obviously she's not but that doesn't mean you have to bail her out. ESPECIALLY when she's b*tched about your \"cheap\" wedding. She's not a family member that's worth being bailed out.", "The OP wondering if they're in the wrong is a little hard to believe tbh", "Just to be nice. And to be able to say she did something. And to get her parents off her back a little. And because it's probably more insulting than doing nothing.", "I agree. When me and my husband decided to get married, we went to the courthouse and had a nice day out together. That\u2019s been a few years ago and I don\u2019t regret it a bit. I hate spoiled entitled brats.", "Your sister sounds like a very special person. But I bet you\u2019re a good person too, for her to love you so much and be willing to do that for you. I wish you the best on getting on better footing.", "Truth.  We spent less than $1,000 on ours, 35 years ago.", "Same! We spent about $4k and had the wedding in my hometown (we lived out of state, but wanted my parents to be able to attend). We asked that people not bring us gifts because we would have to ship them back home. Instead, everyone showed up with money and gift cards, even though we had asked for no gifts. Welp! That money covered our (already paid for) honeymoon!\n\nI've never been so thankful that my family doesn't listen to me.", "That's what we are gonna do for our wedding/gifts. We are also established adults and don't need anything for our house. The ceremony is going to be a small gathering at his parents beach house, then a reception with maybe 50-60 people at the golf course that he and his family belong to, which will be around $250 to rent for the night. People will pay for their own drinks at the bar. A friend owns a food truck and is giving us a ridiculously good deal to come out to feed everyone. Another good friend of mine (for over 18 years) is a DJ and is also giving an amazing deal as a wedding present. I think the most expensive thing will be my wedding dress, which my sweet mama insisted on paying for.\n\nI saw an article about some website where you'd make a list of all the things you want to do on your honeymoon, like meals out at specific places, different experiences you want to have and people donate for those things. Thought that was a really cool way to make it be a tangible thing for people to donate money towards the honeymoon, instead of just blindly giving cash.", "Sounds like little Golden Child sister has always had everything she wants just given to her, whereas older OP has had to be the sensible one who is financially responsible and supportive.  \n\nWonder how often some version of this scenario played out when they were kids - more money was spent on Sister because OP had made better decisions, and often, OP made better (i.e. cheaper) decisions because there simply wasn't any money left to go towards her things after it was all spent on Sister.", "Thank you!\n\nI'm so fortunate enough to have my sister and her husband in my life!\n\nI like to think I'm okay \ud83d\ude0e\n\nBetting footing is definitely ahead, but probably not any $30,000 weddings \ud83d\ude43", "Forty years ago, we were married in a church with just family present, we all went out to dinner (each couple paid for their own meals), went back to my in-laws for cake and champagne. It was a perfect lovely day.", "That's how I see it. If you're still married in ten years, *then* you can have a big party to celebrate your success.", "That\u2019s what I did. Don\u2019t regret it a bit. It pissed my mom off but it was my day not hers, so I do not care.", "That\u2019s ok she will just demand her sister into paying her rent after all they can afford and she is just be greedy if she doesn\u2019t! \n\nThe entertainment with op\u2019s sister is astonishing!", "I probably got about the same from my folks as TheIowan, and we got a few hundred from his parents. Spouse and I aren\u2019t super fancy people and we wanted something small and low-key. Hey, I was just happy I found someone willing to put up with me on a permanent basis.", "Exactly. If children's literature has taught us anything. It is don't ever give a mouse a cookie.", "Absolutely NTA, your sister, on the other hand, is an asshole. First off, she had the audacity to whine and complain about YOUR wedding, behind your back, and namecall you and your husband just because you didn't want a big, expensive wedding. And then she had the audacity to expect you to pay for HER wedding, after she was rude af to you and your husband. And now she's even trying to smear you MORE for her poor planning skills, all because you won't help with her wedding, despite the fact that SHE didn't help with YOURS? Yeah, I'd just cut her off completely tbh. Full no contact. Though you may want to take the last part with a grain of salt bc I will cut people outta my life like I'm Edward scissor hands...", "Yeah no kidding this is a NTA.\n\nIf someone went around shit-talking my wedding, family or not, they'd be lucky if I even considered attending their at all, never mind gifting them a stupid amount of money.", "This is such a good point.  I can imagine giving the money if that means her sister realizes her mistakes and makes amends. Also, this results in them getting closer. \n\nBUT there's no chance in hell that will happen.", "I agree with you, but can we not call people things.", "Yup, OP should point out yo any one who asks that I funny how sister defines selfish as \"not giving her money that was gifted to me\" and not \"demanding everyone give her money that is not hers to bail her out of financial debt that she put herself in by planning a wedding she knew couldn't fit into her budget\".\n\nNTA OP, oh and doesn't your sister know that regifting is trashy and tacky, just tell her that \"you took her comments about you being trashy and tacky to heart and have been taking steps towards not being trashy and tacky and regifting is tacky and trashy so your sorry but you can't gift her the 20K that was gifted to you by your parents.\"\n\nETA the multiple uses of \" trashy and tacky\" are on purpose, you have to be petty and continually use her words against her.", "My (ex-)husband and I got married in a small ceremony in our own home with just immediate family present. Then on the next two weekends we held small parties--also in our own home--for the people we wanted to celebrate with. We cooked for those ourselves. The only thing anyone else paid for was the dinner after the wedding ceremony, and that's because mom offered. It was basically just a nice dinner at a seafood restaurant for about 10 people. We really enjoyed it, and it was so wonderfully low-stress.", "I expect my parents to help because that's just the way my family is, but $25k is WAY above what I expect to get. I can't wrap my head around these parents who save up five figures for their kids' weddings. It feels very regency dowry to me.", "Ditto.  We didn\u2019t do anything in advance of the wedding.  We were both 37 yoa and already owned everything we needed.  His first marriage, my second.   His mom paid for our honeymoon, which I thought was too much. She insisted- my husband was her only son.", "I'm sad that I won't be able to have a large wedding because that's the tradition in my family.  It's just not affordable anymore, even with the parents helping out. I have wonderful childhood memories of huge receptions, and none of my younger family members will have those.", "She would not be a doormat for offering to pay for a honeymoon if she is well off. It's called generosity.  Look at most posts on these threads. Most of the answers are we support your selfishness and individuality. For once it would be nice if someone took the high ground.", "but sister wasn\u2019t nice to op at all.", "In this case, it\u2019s not about selfishness versus generosity. OP\u2019s sister is an idiot for blowing through a very sizeable $30k (gifted!) budget *and* putting down deposits for vendors she currently can\u2019t pay for. \n\nThis is about not bailing someone out of their own mess, which was caused purely by stupidity and greed. She doesn\u2019t deserve OP\u2019s hard earned and wisely-saved money. She had $30k. That\u2019s the budget. This is an important life lesson. You can\u2019t spend more than you have and expect others to fix your bonehead mistakes.", "Opposite situation: I went to what I thought was a perfectly ideal wedding maybe a year and a half ago \u2014 great venue, but not over the top, open bar, good food, maybe 120 people. I figured it was maybe $30k. This past fall, the groom was talking about it while we were out having lunch, and I asked if he\u2019d mind giving me a ballpark just for my own planning (we\u2019re friends and shared a lot of financial stuff when we each bought homes). $40k. It\u2019s just so difficult to tell with weddings!", "One of the nicest weddings I've ever been to cost ~$60k. They spent $10k just on the photographer -- and while the photos were gorgeous, I don't think they're displayed much anymore since the marriage only lasted a couple of years...", "My mom had probably 200 guests, and the total cost of the wedding and honeymoon were less than what I paid for my midsized sedan. Inflation has made me very bitter."]}
