Why is she picking him over you? It\u2019s very strange (and seems like some brides have a habit of completely losing their normal sensibilities during wedding planning). \n\nI\u2019m not big on ultimatums, but here\u2019s one where it\u2019s him or you at the wedding, her choice, and be prepared to follow through as she won\u2019t believe you. How hurtful (of her). See if other family will support you, it\u2019s a weird hill for her to die on.", "Do you have a +1?  Maybe you should bring HER ex.

It's a place for your sister, so, if he goes, you do not, why have a drama llama there, if it's supposed to be drama free.", "NTA  \nYour sister had no good reason to invite your ex to her wedding. She wants you to see your ex despite all the pain he caused you.", "NTA, but I\u2019d attend only the wedding ceremony and then bolt immediately afterward. That leaves her little to bitch about. Also, she probably seated you with your ex. He\u2019ll have to talk to an empty chair all night.", "NTA if you hadn\u2019t overheard and confronted her about it then it would have been sprung on you at the wedding. That is disgusting behavior.
