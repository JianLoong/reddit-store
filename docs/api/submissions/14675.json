Your cousin has been spoiled and it looks like you shutting him down was the first time he's actually been confronted for once.

I\u2019m guessing she\u2019s pretty sexist herself if that\u2019s how she views standing up for yourself / what you believe is right.

Also, I don't think she herself is misogynistic, but something I've noticed is that a lot of women in my family tend to be really soft on their first born sons, and that tends to spoil them a lot, so Dave's shitty attitude might be redeemable, but I don't really want to spend more time with him than necessary.", "It seems unbelievable because you don't have the history with my aunt like I do. It's easy to call me dumb and say of course you're not the one in the wrong, but keep in mind in my family, when I was younger my aunt was like a second mother to me.

I've still got stuff that I just avoid the terms for as much as possible since I know what I used then and I wouldn't use it now if I was doing the same thing currently, but at the time it felt as fine as anything else so \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nETA: Re the comment at the beginning of this thread, iirc the Wachowski sisters have talked about never having been men, just having been in the closet, so in that case it's an accurate statement because it's referring to their own description of their experiences. But for folks who haven't gone on record to say that, we can't make definitive statements", "They were always women, the fact that they didn\u2019t feel safe to live openly as women in no way changes that.\n\nYou are clearly not nearly as supportive of trans people as you claim to be", "So are gay people straight until they figure out their sexuality? lol  \nSee how absurd that sounds.", "Why are they the authority on this? A lot of people say a lot of things.", "Agreed\u2026", "I\u2019m not trans, but most trans people that I\u2019m familiar with know they\u2019re trans long before they know trans is a thing.\n\nIn other words, two trans women were trans women before they publicly transitioned.", "It is dangerously easy to fall for what a figure of authority says. But right now you have a chance to reevaluate and question it. You wrote \"is making me second guess putting Dave in his place **that rudely**\" - since when is asking someone to check their sources even remotely rude? Rude is the awakening Dave will have the second he sets foot on the real world, if that's how he reacts to being corrected.\n\nStart trusting your judgment and take what your aunt says with a grain of salt. Just because she was/is great in some ways, doesn't mean she isn't sexist and an enabler for men, or at least her son. Good luck!", "It is possible for good people to go down bad paths. It sounds like your aunt is being swayed by what your cousin is listening to, or potentially she's being abused by her son and/or the other men in her life. She may feel pressured to say what she did to you later because they make her life so miserable at home if she doesn't. It doesn't necessarily mean she believes it. Hopefully your cousin can leave the brain washing cult he's joined soon and rejoin us all in reality and your aunt can get some peace.", "Swich was my favourite in that movie.", "They were ALWAYS trans women, the fact that they waited to come out until later in life doesn\u2019t make them any less trans before that.", "Yup, but if you have special edition DVDs for some of them and older copies for others, the title cards are sometimes updated! For a while I had a VCR of the original (Wachowski Brothers), a Reloaded from an omnibus set (Wachowskis), and a Revolutions from a special edition anniversary set (Wachowski Sisters.) Also a copy of AniMatrix that would straight up crash the DVD player if you didn't skip the title sequences. Apologies, I forget that not everyone collects movies like an insane person.", "They literally called themselves brothers...\n\nThis was them during filming.

Totally unbelievable!", "But I thought sexuality was a spectrum?", "Not a shining endorsement", "Not 25 years ago.", "My guess is that it's rooted in the idea that men are \"hard facts\" types and women are \"emotional\" (for better and worse), so as a woman you're supposed to be wise and kind enough to know that correcting a man isn't necessary.", "Yes yes yes! I was hoping this would come up. Such a beautiful representation of two incredible women!", "Its very difficult to explain funny to a dipshit with no sense of humor. You are just going to have to take my word for it. I thought it was hilarious.", "It was funny, princess... admit it.", "Nah. You\u2019re an unfunny bigot.", "NTA he was being a dick and you put him in his place. He\u2019s not \u201call that\u201d and it\u2019s better he learns it from you before he gets a rude awakening from society. The people laughing at him just proves that you were right and I\u2019m sure he was embarrassed about it and *hopefully* he will think twice next time before running his mouth.", "YTA and you sound insufferable", "Why don\u2019t you tell your cousin to start watching Andrew tate instead of whatever loser guru he watches now.

Not everyone is going to have the same sense. Some like Amy Shumer, some like George Carlin. It is a SENSE of what one thinks is funny.\n2. You are too sensitive.

You wouldn\u2019t say that someone who is gay was straight until they came out. They were in the closet. The closet exists for trans people.
