So he can give but not take and he appears to still be a mama's boy who needs his mommy to stand up for him. Good thing you put him in his place. Maybe from now on he will be less egotistic - at least in front of you!", "NTA pointing out facts is mean, now? I don't even know what she's possibly labeling as \"manly\" but since she has such a low opinion of women, that sounds like it's actually a compliment. \n\nAlso, The Matrix was made by two *trans* women and is a trans metaphor. :D", "NTA at all.

Nah. \n\nAlso i think it's totally ok to put these kindve misogynists in their place and you did it with a simple fact. \n\nIf we don't check these idiots and shame them for their moronic beliefs,  they will think it's ok to subjugate people to their hatred and ignorance.", "100% NTA. It is so satisfying having someone so obnoxious be put in their place. \n\nI agree that your aunt has a sense of internalized misogyny for her comment about being manly for making a comment. It looks like the Apple doesn\u2019t fall far from the tree. \n\nSimply engaging someone by a question about something they\u2019re openly discussing (in this case, very misogynistic and inaccurate viewpoints about women) isn\u2019t a masculine move, it\u2019s social behaviour. \n\nHim feeling butthurt that his views are being challenged is on himself. \n\nIf he isn\u2019t willing to have anyone question him about his own discussion points that I\u2019m assuming he\u2019s all subjected to you unprompted, he  isn\u2019t very mature enough to have a real adult conversation. \n\nYou were not being rude, you just asked a question.", "NTA\n\nAnd your Aunt's reactions shows that the Apple doesn't fall far from the tree", "NTA. Dave is an AH, and his mother coddles him. Tell your aunt that her son believes women are beneath him and you feel bad that she supports his opinions.", "NTA. It seems like your aunt has some internalized misogyny if she thinks you telling him off is too much like a man. Your cousin has been spoiled and it looks like you shutting him down was the first time he's actually been confronted for once. I'm surprised no one in the group ever called him out for his disgusting takes on women. Sometimes people like Dave need a harsh dose of humbling to understand why they are wrong.", ">Now however, my aunt is saying that I was too mean to him\n\nSo the person who created the monster is defending her precious baby against being contradicted. No surprise there. \n\n>she says I'm acting too much like a man\n\nWhatever that is supposed to mean.\n\nYou're NTA.", "NTA. But if my aunt had something like that to me, my answer would be \u201chow can you tell, since you obviously didn\u2019t raise one\u201d.   It was great you put him in his place.", "NTA. Your moron cousin got his moronic outlook from your moron aunt.", "thank you so much, you legitimately have no idea how good this makes me feel, to hear you say this", "Uh, how tf does his aunt saying he\u2019s acting too much like a MAN equal misogynist/misogyny? I know it\u2019s the \u2018go to term\u2019 for all things man/woman,  but that makes zero sense.", "because as we all know, pointing out movie facts is a man's work", "How is that misogyny?", "Don't tell Dave that - he probably doesn't view transwomen as women, so will claim that the Matrix was actually made by two 'men'.", "Yeah TIL, before 2010 they were the \u201cWachowski brothers\u201d, but now they\u2019re \u201cthe Wachowski sisters\u201d. Never knew that. \n\nEdit: alright the \u201c2010\u201d date was simplified, it\u2019s just what the top of the Wikipedia article said. Much more complicated timeline than that though. Details it under the \u201cPersonal Lives\u201d section: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wachowskis\n\nOh and obviously NTA op. If you really look up to your aunt, I\u2019d dig into that \u201cyou\u2019re acting too much like a man\u201d comment a little more. Ask her to explain what she means. I\u2019m guessing she\u2019s pretty sexist herself if that\u2019s how she views standing up for yourself / what you believe is right. As if it\u2019s not a woman\u2019s place to assert her opinion on matters being discussed. That they\u2019re supposed to keep their mouth shut and go along whatever the man in the room says\u2026 at least that\u2019s what it sounds like from such a comment. Maybe it\u2019s taken out of context, or maybe she was referring to something else. But either way, there not a lot of good interpretations to such a comment, regardless of what she was referring. And there\u2019s nothing \u201cmanly\u201d about what you did. It was the right thing to do lol. Sorry you cousin is such an ignorant prick. Glad you put him in his place ;)", "I might be wrong on this, but I don't think she in general is misogynistic, I think her love for her son blinds her and makes her get offended on his behalf. I'm sure she'll come around.", "That's probably not a good idea, I really don't want to unnecessarily antagonize her. Also, I don't think she herself is misogynistic, but something I've noticed is that a lot of women in my family tend to be really soft on their first born sons, and that tends to spoil them a lot, so Dave's shitty attitude might be redeemable, but I don't really want to spend more time with him than necessary.", "It seems unbelievable because you don't have the history with my aunt like I do. It's easy to call me dumb and say of course you're not the one in the wrong, but keep in mind in my family, when I was younger my aunt was like a second mother to me. And she's incredibly decisive and wise in most things, and has helped me out so much, so when a person like that says that you're wrong, even if you know she could be biased because it's her son, you still take it to heart", "Uh, you mean Lily and Lana Wachowski right? They are women", "Unfortunately people can be amazing and important to us and still have some minor... or major... flaws \ud83d\ude15\nNow that you know this about her, you know how to approach things she says.", "The aunt said that SHE (aka OP) is acting too much like a man.", "OP by her own statement is 19F, the F standing for female.\n\nOP according to aunt acts too much like a man when she puts cousin in his place.\n\nErgo, aunt does not approve of women putting men (or people in general) in their place.\n\n.... I don't know how much more misogynist you can get. This is a clear case of \"if you were a man, this behaviour would be acceptable, but because you're a woman you should stfu.\"", "You\u2019ve asked this a bunch and ignored the answer. Like please stop. You\u2019re embarrassing yourself", "Go look it up no one is here to educate the idiots.", "I think he was going to say something transphobic but he didn't get it out because we were all just laughing at his expression to finding out the Matrix was made by women at that point.", "This. Just ask her. \u2018How do you mean\u2019. Or \u2018why\u2019. And than leave her to feel complicated or confronted with her own thoughts. \n\nAnd yes, you did right by telling him about the matrix- you told him he was stupid without telling him is stupid. \nIf I was more like your aunt, I would say you used a graceful, female way. But that\u2019s not my style - I\u2019ll keep it to good work!", "Fair enough - obviously you know her better than I do!", "You don't say how old Dave is, but he is at minimum, a teenager. Her opportunity to correct him has come and gone and she's clearly been just fine with how he's acting since she's never done anything about it.\n\nYour aunt is complicit, and likely misogynistic. It happens frequently.", "Think about why her go-to insult in this situation was \u201cYou\u2019re acting like a man\u201d. Not you\u2019re being bratty or too harsh. The first thing she thought was the fact that you were smart and pointing out the flaws is his argument was acting like a man. She believes his rhetoric. Maybe not to the same degree, but it\u2019s there.", "Cut toxic people out of your life and you\u2019ll be happier."]}
