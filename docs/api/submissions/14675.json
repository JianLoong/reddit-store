Your cousin has been spoiled and it looks like you shutting him down was the first time he's actually been confronted for once.

I\u2019m guessing she\u2019s pretty sexist herself if that\u2019s how she views standing up for yourself / what you believe is right.

Also, I don't think she herself is misogynistic, but something I've noticed is that a lot of women in my family tend to be really soft on their first born sons, and that tends to spoil them a lot, so Dave's shitty attitude might be redeemable, but I don't really want to spend more time with him than necessary.", "It seems unbelievable because you don't have the history with my aunt like I do. It's easy to call me dumb and say of course you're not the one in the wrong, but keep in mind in my family, when I was younger my aunt was like a second mother to me.

I don't think your cousin will enjoy the linked articles below.\n\nBoth Lana and Lilly Wachowski confirmed theories of The Matrix being a metaphor for the trans experience, and drew comparisons between the trans experience and The Matrix.\n\n*For example, Neo is offered a choice between a red and blue pill. The red pill will open his eyes to the truth that he is living in a simulation. The blue pill will allow him to continue in ignorance. The red pill that Neo ends up taking is similar to what estrogen pills, used for hormone replacement therapy, looked like in the nineties.*  \n*Another example: the Wachowskis wanted the character Switch to present as male in the real world while presenting as female in the Matrix, as an explicit nod to the idea of transness in an online world. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Keanu Reeves, who played Neo in the movies, recalled an early draft of the script that was later changed. \"I think the studio wasn't ready for that,\" he said. The character ended up presenting as a woman in both dimensions.*  \n*But crucially, it's the spirit of self-actualization that resonates so strongly with many trans people \u2013 the existence of a true identity beyond your physical form, an ideal self that you can seize control of via the internet from an uncaring system.*\n\n['I, too, was living a double life': Why trans fans connect to 'The Matrix'](https://www.npr.org/2021/12/22/1066554369/the-matrix-original-trans-fans-resurrections)\n\n[The Matrix is a 'trans metaphor', Lilly Wachowski says](https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-53692435)", "Also, I\u2019m curious exactly how she thinks you\u2019re \u201cbeing like a man\u201d?
