Usually he\u2019s pretty good with helping out but lately he has been neglecting household chores and me to sit and play games from the second he gets home until he goes to bed every night. I don\u2019t mind that he plays games but it\u2019s when it\u2019s days on end without lifting a finger it gets ridiculous. Also to note I do all of the cooking, grocery shopping and take care of 80% of the bills.\n\nYesterday at work I fell from the top of a 3m ladder and landed on my arm which is now luckily not broken but severely bruised and swollen with a slight fracture. When I got home after receiving medical treatment he asked how I was and then immediately went to the games. A couple of hours later after not speaking to me the whole afternoon says \u2018what\u2019s for dinner\u2019 I told him \u2018whatever your making\u2019 he laughed it off like I was joking. I ended up making toast for myself and went to bed. He gets into bed a few hours later and wakes me up to ask me for sexual favours. I said no and he kept persisting and even started to get angry with me about it. After a good 10 minutes of him carrying on while I was trying to get back to sleep I snapped. I screamed at him to shut up and consider how I feel especially with the events of the day unfolding and told him that he is a disgusting, selfish pig if that\u2019s all he cared about and he can get tf out of my bed. \n\nHe apologised for his actions and promised me he wouldn\u2019t do it again. Today he messaged me while I was at an appointment asking me to buy alcohol and red bulls and bring it home for him. He had finished work 4 hours before messaging me and surprise he was playing games. We literally live directly across from a shopping centre with multiple alcohol shops and supermarkets. I snapped and told him to F off and he has resorted to ignoring me ever since I arrived home.\n\nAita for screaming at him or was I being completely reasonable?\n\nEdit: his friends and some family members have since messaged saying that they understand I\u2019m frustrated but I should have been nicer to him. I have bipolar disorder and am unsure if the approach was too aggressive", "created_utc": 1684488141, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13lqbdj/aita_for_yelling_at_my_bf_and_calling_him_a/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Exactly, NO ONE. \n\nPlease, take my advise and talk to him about it. You can make a deal with him: For every hour he plays, he has to spend another hour making chores (groceries, do the dishes,..etc.). But if he doesn't change, you better take your stuff and leave.
