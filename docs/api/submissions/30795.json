Most handlers know, if you don\u2019t want people to bother your dog, they should be vested even though it\u2019s not legally required. Even non service dogs will often wear leash straps or collars that say do not pet/do not distract for this reason. I understand the handler being strict the first time because many people need it to be said firmly but she never should\u2019ve gone off at OP. Especially since OP immediately apologized, that should\u2019ve made it clear to the handler that it was an accident.", "Ah yes very fair to the dog to not be able to go for a walk and get exercise and intrigue and a bit of freedom simply because humans can't NOT be annoying \ud83d\ude44", "You know dogs need to potty and exercise right? They can\u2019t just be locked at home all the time", "Yeah this seems really extreme. Maybe like a seeing eye dog guiding its owner across a street or something but that is a very niche scenario.", "If a seizure alert is delayed, someone can think they have more time to get somewhere safe and end up falling and potentially hitting their head", "Chiropractor!!!\n\n\ud83e\udd23", "Like that emotional support pony a woman tried to take on a plane.", "And that's pretty much exactly what I do. It's not even a full wave, just kind of a little half wave; more just wiggling fingers and not a super high-pitched voice or anything. Someone else commented that it would be really weird to say hi or wave at kids walking with their parents, and I'm like, \"Do you even have kids?\" My son, 5, is a bit more reserved, but my daughter, 3, says \"hi\" to everyone, and it's kind of soul crushing when absolutely no one says \"hi\" back and she starts to look a little sad. But she perks up as soon as she sees another person, and it just makes her day if someone acknowledges her.", "It\u2019s more what they\u2019re doing than their training. These dogs have a gene that allows them to smell the changes in a person\u2019s biochemistry that allows them to warn their handler about an incoming seizure, heart issue, a change in blood sugar, what have you. And for some, that change doesn\u2019t last long, so talking to that dog can really take their focus enough away from their task. \n\nLet me give an example. I have a seizure disorder, non-epileptic, and my dog is not an alert dog. He\u2019s a response dog. So he\u2019s performing tasks that I give cues (or commands) for. He hears me say Pillow or Brace or other things and does the task. \n\nAn alert dog, however, would be waiting to smell that change. So while me giving my dog a cue would bring his focus back to me, the smell might not be as \u201cloud\u201d and might get missed. Even still, at the end of the day, a service dog is a dog. Someone talking to my dog means that\u2019s another moment I have to stop what I\u2019m doing to potentially redirect and refocus him. While he does pretty well- maybe doesn\u2019t need a refocus 85% of the time- each interruption is someone interrupting my life. \n\nSo it kind of boils down to yes, my dog is trained to bring his focus back on me, but that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t rude and unnecessary and exhausting to have people talking to him all the time. And if an alert dog misses an alert, that can lead to a medical emergency because the handler wasn\u2019t told when to get themselves safe and now they\u2019re hurt. It isn\u2019t worth the risk.", "I was just answering the question. I know there are a lot of invisible disabilities and I don't assume, but I was asked if she had a visible disability and she didn't. I don't know why I was downvoted just for answering a question.", "I'm also visually impaired (nystagmus so severe they thought I would be blind by 6\u2014I still can't drive, and weird people out by moving my head constantly to look at something specific).\n\nBut clearly I struck a nerve and people flip out about simple \"see\" puns, and then wish blindness on people for them, as the highly upvoted response did.", "Service dogs are trained to ignore distractions. While I agree you shouldn't distract them while they're working, saying \"hi\" to them shouldn't be enough to interrupt their work", "If you're in a place that dogs are allowed you have no way of knowing if a dog is a service dog.", "True but ghat being said its common to find videos of owners who deal with people disrespecting their service dogs badges even with the vest on. I want to give the lady the benefit if the doubt and say she was fed up with being disrespected but there is no proof of that. While i think op is weird for acknowledging every animal they see like that unknowing them or the owners, in this situation i have to agree that shes not the ah", "Even though they know better and their vest says to not pet them people ask, because everyone for some reason think the rules apply to everyone else"]}
