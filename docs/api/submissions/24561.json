One of them was a well behaved girl (13ish) who sat in the aisle seat while the kid - probably 6 or 7 - sat in the window seat. I had been up all night working on a presentation and was hoping to get some shuteye on the 2 hour flight. \n\nUnfortunately during takeoff the kid began kicking my seat.\n\nAfter we were in the air I turned around and told the mom that her son was continuing to kick my seat to which she said \u201coh\u2026 sorry\u201d and turned back to her iPad. I imagined if I was in that scenario I\u2019d take it as a cue to tell my kid to stop. He didn\u2019t. After about 5 minutes of peace he starts kicking my seat again. It wasn\u2019t steady percussion of kicks but it was the starting and stopping of the kicking that was the worst.\n\nI turned around and asked his mom if he could stop.\n\n\u201cHe just kicks, he has a lot of energy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to sleep\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a short flight\u201d\n\nShe just kind of laughed jovially and shrugged at me. I turned around defeated and after this happened again for another 5 minutes I asked her one more time.\n\nShe then said something to the affect of \u201cyou\u2019re an adult, time to act like a grown up and take the high road\u201d and then to stop bothering her family. I stewed on this for a bit while the kicking persisted and my thoughts turned to violence.\n\nAfter another 10 minutes debating on pulling this trigger/working up the nerve, eventually I turned around and said with a smile on my face to the kid \u201chey do you want to know a secret about Santa Claus?\u201d \n\nHe kept kicking the seat not even paying attention to me and I don\u2019t think his mom even really processed how vindictive I really was about to become. Part of me was hoping she would call my bluff and that she would get him to back off.\n\nI told him \u201che isn\u2019t real, your mom made him up\u201d\n\nAnd then for some reason as an afterthought even after the damage was done I added \u201cto trick you\u201d. As in \u201cyour mom made Santa up just to trick you\u201d. I didn\u2019t even hate the kid I just wanted his mom to suffer.\n\nHe just stared at me for a moment and stopped kicking. I don\u2019t think he really believed me until he looked at his mom who had eyes as wide as saucers. After he saw the affirmation of what I was saying on his mom\nhe got a little quieter. She raised her voice about as loud as you reasonably could on an airplane & told me to stop harassing her children and that I was \u201ctrying to mentally abuse them\u201d to the stewardess when she came by to stop the commotion.\n\nThe rest of that flight was the longest hour of my life and I felt like everyone was shooting daggers at me on the plane.

There were a few options she could have taken including switching her kids seats, giving the kid the I pad or an activity. I think most people don't understand it's not the actual actions of a kid that makes people upset, it's when you see a parent not care or even try.", "NTA.  That's some damn terrible parenting and you had limited ways to engage.  It's insane she had the nerve to call the flight attendant and imply that you were the one who should be an adult by getting over it instead she who should be an adult by being a mother to her child.", "Justified AH.", "NTA. I once found myself in a similar situation, except worse - the mother was actively encouraging the behavior. My revenge was teaching the kid in question the equivalent of the c-word. As I was leaving, I heard him yelling it at the top of his lungs.", "NTA\n\nThat mom fucked around and found out", "NTA the mom and kid both fucked around and found out \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "> \u201cIt\u2019s a short flight\u201d\n\n> \u201cyou\u2019re an adult, time to act like a grown up and take the high road\u201d\n\nESH.

Hopefully the mom learned a lesson.\n\nIt would be AH if the OP did something nasty to the kid, mom was there and accountable for the kids actions.\n\nMoms out there: don't let your kids talk/engage with strangers.", "ESH \n\nThe mum for obvious reasons. \n\nBut you especially. Why didn\u2019t you call the steward and get them to deal with it? Why did you have to be mean and vindictive to a kid? Yeah he was a little shit, but to ruin the one thing kids love the most. You could have told him to stop yourself. You didn\u2019t need to resort to ruining a childhood.", "NTA.

She wasn't even trying to stop her kid being annoying to a stranger, and didn't even take you seriously at all. She was utterly inconsiderate.\n\nYou took out your anger on a small child, which isn't justifiable. Some people here are arguing about whether it ruins Christmas for the kid or not, I think that's beyond the point, it doesn't even matter if the kid believed you. The important part is that the woman was shitty to you so your idea was to get back at her by hurting her child, which means you were also wrong.", "ESH.

Everybody's actions in this situation fucking sucked.", "NTA.  Mom got what she deserved.  A kid that age should know better than to kick your seat.  Also, fucking hilarious.", "NTA and that is hilarious. The mother sounds awful.", "NTA\n\nThis is a fuck around and find out kind of moment in which mom thought she had all the control and power, and refused to parent her brat.

She's flying alone, with two kids. \n\nKids are a product of their parents, and I work with plenty of jerk kids, and jerk parents. That doesn't give me the right to stoop down to the level of the children I work with though. \n\nYou're the adult in the situation. Act like it.", "ESH.  She was an absent parent who should have corrected her kids behavior.  You wanted to hurt the mother so you purposely went after her child.  God you are both terrible people.", "NTA fair play", "I mean the answer is obviously that she was an arsehole for not discipline her kid, especially in public when they\u2019re actively disrupting the life of a stranger\n\nAnd some kind of response is justified\n\nHowever, tell a small child that Santa isn\u2019t real just feels over the line because my kids would probably have cried if they heard that from a stranger at his age so it seems to be a bit of an overreaction to respond to a mild annoyance of disrupting a couple hour Power Nap, by potentially shattering the child\u2019s view of the world and potentially ruining what is very possibly their favourite time of year\n\nThe long term consequences of the two behaviours, and the immediate harm caused by them, are simply not proportional", "NTA. Applaud you!", "ESH it was going to be a losing battle no matter what. The kid hasn\u2019t been brought up properly and that\u2019s the mothers fault and yeah it\u2019s fucking annoying but the kid was still young and I think you went too far with it. It was a no win situation the mother was difficult and I think for me if it\u2019s only 2 hours I\u2019d just have to sit and deal with it", "NTA - Fuck them kids", "YTA \n\nBut the story also made me laugh so maybe I'm an AH as well", "YTA. The proper next step would have been to alert a flight attendant, NOT decide to be a mean troll to a child.", "ESH except the kid.\n\nThe mother was in the clear wrong. She's a terrible parent and an inconsiderate human being.\n\nYou didn't punish her with your words. You punished an innocent child. It's not the kids fault he's not being disciplined.  Next time call the stewardess or complain to the airline.", "The parent of the child had poor behaviour and so did you.", "NTA", "Definitely YTA, for the delivery. \n\nBut somehow I applaud what you did. And then there\u2019s the part of me that is just furious with the mother. Take some responsibility and control your child. It\u2019s not that hard. . . \n\nLastly: You will live in infamy in their minds forever. You\u2019ve got a permanent space in this family\u2019s history now. Free mind rent \ud83e\udd73", "YTA \n\nNot because it's a nice vote but it was immature, the punishment didn't fit the crime and it was malicious. It was an after thought to discredit the mother in the child's eyes to get back at the mother. Children are not pawns to make people act how you want. \n\nYou could have easily told the kid you work for Santa and are a secret agent. You will let Santa know he is disrespectful...\n\nAny other response - telling the kid to knock it off with an idle threat of calling the police or such would be an NTA response for me. But every choice you made here was something that could have been done better. It was particularly meant to hurt and upset others without regard for any compassion or empathy at all. \n\nIt was immature and reactive. \n\n**For other parents with high energy kids, teach them to bounce their foot or knee instead. This saves Soo much grief when having to be contained in tight spaces.", "Of course, YTA. If the parents don't respond you call for a flight steward. You need to exhaust all the options before you go nuclear....and Santa is the most nuclear of options.", "The kid is old enough to know better and that mom is a total jerk.

I have young kids and it's crossed my mind what would happen if a school friend told them Santa wasn't real, as I stopped believing after this happened. I'm not thinking of this kid - he and mum deserved it quite frankly - but will it have repercussions on other completely innocent children?", "Kids are a product of their parents. \n\nYTA. \n\nThat child clearly has a crap mom, which you *already knew* from your interaction with her. \n\nSo, you punished this child who is already going to be punished because he\u2019s a little sh*t due to being raised by a bigger sh*t. \n\nYou\u2019re just mean.", "YTA.
