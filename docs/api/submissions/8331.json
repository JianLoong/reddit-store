I was told to not drink on my new mood stabilizers so I hadn\u2019t drank any. Near the end of the night this one girl who I had been talking to got really really drunk, like too drunk to do anything so I decided it would be best to get her home safely.\n\nI offered her and her friends a ride home and they accepted. It was about a 15 minute drive a few minutes into the drive one said was feeling ill. I pulled over but I couldn\u2019t get her out because she was scared to get out on the side of the road at night. After another 10 minutes, I stopped trying and got back in the road and got her friends to let her let her sit by the window and locked the window down.\n\n4 or 5 minutes later, she puked. She didn\u2019t even make an effort to throw her head out the window. I got them home and walked them upstairs. I walked got the girls social media so I could contact her because she was going to either pay for my car to be cleaned. Which I don\u2019t think is unreasonable. \n\nSo I dropped them off and did my best to clean and got my car professionally cleaned the next day. I messaged her how much it would cost and she never responded. I sent her multiple messages and she never responded. Eventually she blocked me on everything and I have no way to contact her, well except one. Going back to their place.\n\nWhich I did. The first time I went someone answered the door and I asked for the girl and the person went to go get them for a few minutes and she \u201cwasn\u2019t there\u201d.\n\nI visited 3 more times since then and the last time I caught her leaving and confronted her. She called me a psycho, I told her that she fucked up my car and I had to pay to get it clean so she needs to pay and that I wouldn\u2019t be coming here if she simply paid up. We got into a huge argument before people started coming out and I decided to leave. I feel like she\u2019s painting me as a bad guy when I\u2019ve done nothing wrong and she\u2019s the actually person who\u2019s done bad shit.\n\nAITA", "created_utc": 1674745063, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ltojb/aita_for_paying_a_girl_multiple_visits_to_her/", "score": 56, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
