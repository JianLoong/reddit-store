If someone gets drunk and I give them a ride, they like in my car, then they pay to clean it. If she was sick with a virus or something, that's totally different. But no one NEEDS to get drunk at all. \n\nNow, you didn't need to go to their house and harass them, but really, what did you expect. She was drunk. I think I would have called them an uberm sounds like it would have been cheaper. Go to the courthouse and file there. That's the only way you're going to see any money.", "NTA.\n\nYou took some girls home who were drunk and helped them get home safely. \n\nYou tried to make contact via social media about paying for the car cleanup. She blocked your means of contact. \n\nYou tried to make contact via checking in at their house, knocking on the door and being told she wasn\u2019t home.\n\nYou saw her and confronted her and was like \u201chey, can you pay for my car you puked in?\u201d Unless you were sitting waiting in your car watching the house, you don\u2019t have another way of communicating with this person. \n\nShe\u2019s the asshole. It\u2019s not hard to say \u201chey I don\u2019t have the money to pay you, I\u2019m really sorry about your car, how about I drive you back the next few times?\u201d Or whatever. \n\nJust ignoring someone who obviously goes to the same school as you and that you did something to their car REGARDLESS OF BEING DRUNK, cus that doesn\u2019t absolve you of guilt btw, doesn\u2019t work. \n\nHowever, now that she\u2019s said to leave her alone, I\u2019d either go to the small claims court to file it if you want to go that route or just chalk it up as a loss and let your frat know what happened so those girls aren\u2019t invited anymore. If you continue to go back to the house, now it would be considered harassment.", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s avoiding you so she doesn\u2019t have to pay up. \n\nUnfortunately it sounds like she\u2019s not going to pay for the clean up, or clean up her own puke. \n\nYou did a good job doing the right thing, OP, but sometimes people suck.\n\nKeep being the kind and helpful person you are.", "NTA. The people saying he\u2019s harassing her, would y\u2019all be saying that if the roles are reversed? Y\u2019all are saying legal action? They are in college, do you really think he needs to lawyer up (how will he pay for this?) over all this is ridiculous, she has no regards and is crappy. Recommend black listing her from future events!", "NTA\n\nShowing up to someone's house and asking to speak with them is not harassment. She's hoping you'll go away and she won't have to deal with the consequences of her actions. If small claims court is an option, go for it.", "As Judge Judy would say \u201cha harassment?! You owed him money young lady! If you paid him what you owed him he wouldn\u2019t be harassing you. You threw up in the car you owe him money pay the man I\u2019m done!\u201d\n\nNTA", "It\u2019s a hard one because I mean I personally would of probably cut my losses after going round the first time but with your logic I could hypothetically just borrow some money from you or something like that and when you ask for it back just block you and when you come round I\u2019ll claim your harassing me and I\u2019ll just keep the money claim the moral high ground and you can cut your losses.", "Small claims court is a lot of money. Once she ignored him on socials, he should have (maybe not so) low key called her out. Something like \u201cThank you (name) for teaching me a valuable lesson: never give anyone a ride home when they\u2019re drunk if they\u2019re not willing to take responsibility for their actions once they\u2019re sober\u201d. Petty as hell but I bet she would have paid out of embarrassment and would probably think twice about how she treats people in the future.", "hey let\u2019s not tell op to start harassing her online instead of irl. that\u2019s not any better. he needs to leave her alone and cut his losses before *she* decides to take action against *him.* she clearly has no intention of paying him back and shaming her on social media is just going to make op seem like MORE of a stalker in this situation", "the solution here is not lying and tarnishing her reputation. it\u2019s not \u201cembellishing\u201d when you\u2019re straight up making things up. that\u2019s incredibly immature and is only going to make op look like more of an asshole in the long run", "What lesson do you think he should learn?", "Honestly what I said to say isnt lying.  She got wildly drunk, she is a sloppy drunk, and she had to be taken home.  The breaking shit would be his car, as she did damage to it that needed money to fix.   If she cant own up to what she did while drunk, she should not be allowed to get drunk for free at frat houses.  He doesnt need to embellish, but embellishing is definitely deserved.", "seems you and i have very different definitions of breaking shit. nothing was broken, she threw up and the car needed to get cleaned. imo that\u2019s not breaking anything. she didn\u2019t \u201cstart breaking shit so he was forced to drive her home\u201d as you said. op already doesn\u2019t look good in this situation and embellishments that can be proven false aren\u2019t going to make him look any better. just saying", "I agree that it's a huge pain and probably not worth it. but I don't think that showing up at her house five times and cornering her is the right move\n\nit was really nice of OP to get her home safe, truly. the right thing to do would be for her to pay. but, she didn't actually agree to the ride and she didn't ask for it, which is where this becomes ESH for me. if she had said \"hey can you give me a ride home\" and then puked, itd be a no brainer that she was at fault (though stalking an AH is still not the move). if she was that drunk it shouldn't have come as a huge surprise that she might throw up. yeah it was dumb of her to get that drunk, but maybe she doesn't have the money to pay for a professional cleaner, and had she been coherent enough at the time, she might not have wanted the ride knowing she might end up owing money she doesn't have \n\nI once moved in with a partner and we agreed to split the bills evenly. one day a few weeks in I come home, and he's gone grocery shopping. he spent $500 and told me to fork over $250. is that my share? yeah, but I didn't have $250 to spare unexpectedly, and I never asked him to do that.", "I didn\u2019t say she wasn\u2019t an AH or shouldn\u2019t have fixed the issue in some way. I don\u2019t think him deciding to get it professional cleaned prior to discussing it and expecting her to pay it is okay. He says he doesn\u2019t have that money but didn\u2019t check to see if she had $100 for it either. Personally if I was drunk girl I would have cleaned it myself if I didn\u2019t have the money, assuming she felt safe to do so. We have no idea what these messages said or how threatening they were.", "The intent doesn\u2019t matter. Stalking is unwanted repeated contact. OP has admitted that sending multiple messages and going to her house four times after he was blocked is stalking.", "He's so unhinged because he shows up multiple times after she avoids him to get the money that she owes him.  A lot of entitled brats in this thread trading on fake safety issues.  Call the cops if you think he's unhinged.  That's what she should have done if she was actually scared rather than trying to avoid accountability", "Why are you assuming they would be threatening in any way? Do you really think the type of guy who'd go out of his way to ensure this drunk girls safety is the type to threaten her?\n\nAnd what other option did he have? Let the puke sit in the car while she refuses to acknowledge OP?", "Well, he hadn\u2019t managed to make any contact until the final time, unwanted or otherwise. And if she wouldn\u2019t answer his messages or speak to him the first time he went round, then I don\u2019t see what else he can do. \nBut hey Ho, life isn\u2019t fair. He\u2019s not going to get his money back and he shouldn\u2019t seek her out again. He will have to mark it as one of life\u2019s lessons.", "He likely took her home in the hope of sex later (prior to the puking) not because he actually cared but for selfish reasons. Every DV situation started with a guy who appeared perfect. So do I think a guy can appear to be nice, but act out of selfish reasons or pretend till they get what they want. YES! \n\nHave I been walking home and had creeps offer me a ride home YES! Do I think they cared about me? Fuck no! Would I say yes ever. No way because then that creeper had your address. She was super drunk and might not have considered the risk of having OP take her home. \n\nOP could be a nice guy but I doubt it. A reasonable person doesn\u2019t resort to stalking.", "YTA.  You know where she lives.  Serve her.  Do not stalk her.", "YTA. You offered to drive people that had too much to drink home. You knew the risks. You did the right thing, and it's okay that you want to be reimbursed, but you can't be shocked that a drunk person who probably barely remembers that night isn't cool with your wannabe tough guy collection tactics.\n\nPlay stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "YTA - The step after she refused communication on this was to file a small claims suit, not to stalk her.", "YTA, yes, and yes, you are a psycho.\n\nIf the 200 bucks or whatever the cleaning was is really that important to you, small claims court is your venue, not stalking her, showing up at her place to intimidate her, and trying to publicly castigate her.", "While I don't disagree with the E-S-H verdict, I think it's unfair to say 'well, you brought a drunk person into your car, that's on you.' Should we not be offering anyone drunk a ride then? The intent was extremely kind of him, because if we knew someone had just left a bunch of drunk girls out, we'd pretty rightfully call him an asshole, even slightly. OP also took steps to mitigate the puking, including pulling over, and leaving the window down. If drunk chick had thrown up in an Uber, she would have had to pay to clean that up. It wouldn't even be 'courteous' at that point, it's just something that needs to happen.", "I never said he shouldn't have offered her a ride, and I also said it was kind of him. \n\nWhat I said is he knew that it was a possibility that she could get sick in the car, given her drunken state. He took the risk and got puke in his car. I'm not saying he's an AH for that. I also don't think it's unfair to acknowledge that. \n\nThe reason he's the AH is for how he handled it after the fact. \n\nStill, ESH.", "When you damage property, you are legally responsible for damage to that property. That\u2019s why you pay for car insurance to protect you for when you rear end someone.", "The issue here isn't that she didn't pay it's that she's not communicating.\n\nEveryone agrees she should pay (unless you genuinely don't think she has to for some reason).\n\nWhen your partner asked you for $250 did you ghost him and move back in with your parents?  Would you be surprised if they showed up at your parents house after you ghosted him?  Would he be an asshole for that? (I concede if he kept showing up he would be an asshole but this would be more of a romantic scuffle than actual owing of money.)\n\nPeople say his only reasonable solution was to let it go, which is wildly unfair for him.  Other people say go to court but that's probably more of punishment than losing out on the cleaning fee.\n\nSo it seems like what everyone is saying is \"You messed up doing a good thing learn from it never do that again.\" Which shouldn't be the takeaway. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll OP did was exercise the only source of recourse he had.\n\nIf that way was unacceptable then open a line of communication where you feel comfortable and safe, but if you don't extend that them forcing you to communicate is not abuse or stalking or harassments (for my own moral definition).\n\nAND you can't complain they are stalking you because really all they want to do is hold you responsible and accountable, and you are trying actively at every available opportunity to absolve yourself of that responsibility by doing toddler level reality denial of just ignoring the whole situation.", "Or didn\u2019t want to clean another persons mf\u2019n vomit????"]}
