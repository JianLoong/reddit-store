I was told to not drink on my new mood stabilizers so I hadn\u2019t drank any. Near the end of the night this one girl who I had been talking to got really really drunk, like too drunk to do anything so I decided it would be best to get her home safely.\n\nI offered her and her friends a ride home and they accepted. It was about a 15 minute drive a few minutes into the drive one said was feeling ill. I pulled over but I couldn\u2019t get her out because she was scared to get out on the side of the road at night. After another 10 minutes, I stopped trying and got back in the road and got her friends to let her let her sit by the window and locked the window down.\n\n4 or 5 minutes later, she puked. She didn\u2019t even make an effort to throw her head out the window. I got them home and walked them upstairs. I walked got the girls social media so I could contact her because she was going to either pay for my car to be cleaned. Which I don\u2019t think is unreasonable. \n\nSo I dropped them off and did my best to clean and got my car professionally cleaned the next day. I messaged her how much it would cost and she never responded. I sent her multiple messages and she never responded. Eventually she blocked me on everything and I have no way to contact her, well except one. Going back to their place.\n\nWhich I did. The first time I went someone answered the door and I asked for the girl and the person went to go get them for a few minutes and she \u201cwasn\u2019t there\u201d.\n\nI visited 3 more times since then and the last time I caught her leaving and confronted her. She called me a psycho, I told her that she fucked up my car and I had to pay to get it clean so she needs to pay and that I wouldn\u2019t be coming here if she simply paid up. We got into a huge argument before people started coming out and I decided to leave.

You'll be lucky if she (or someone else) doesn't call the cops on you if you keep trying\n\nThis is such a bad take.  It might legally constitute stalking but I HIGHLY doubt it.  She owes him money, is your landlord stalking you if they come around every couple days hounding for rent?\n\n>when she blocked you on social media that was your cue to cut your losses.\n\nSo if you owe someone money and they block all communication it's their cue to cut their losses?\n\nThis is tantamount to saying \"well what are you supposed to do?

What exactly were you accusing him of since it wasn't attempted rape?", "You made the implications, kiddo...", "Are you seriously trying to claim that the \"do something\" didn't refer to sexual acts, or are you trying to make the argument that doing sexual acts to someone that's black out drunk while you're sober isn't rape?", "bro you sound totally unhinged", "Dude go get some fresh air. You clearly need it.", "Soooo\u2026 you're telling me that you have a problem with a man recognizing a woman is too drunk to consent, and instead of taking advantage\u2026. he drover her and her friends home to make sure they made it back safely?\n\nYou're upset that he did the right thing? Am I missing something? There's nothing wrong with talking to someone at a party and hope it develops or segues into something else. It would have been wrong if he tried to force something or got upset with her that she wouldn't put out or whatever. But that's not what happened. He acknowledged she was wasted and made sure that not only she got home safe, but her friends as well. ***How dare he!*** /s", "Just because he is talking to her does not mean they are alone... (Jumping to conclusions also IS a thing).\n\nWhat is NOT a thing is implying he had intentions of being alone with an inebriated girl. That is the kind of thing that can ruin lives and reputations. See the sub information and perhaps use the INFO tag to ask OP to clarify the surroundings at the time he realized she was drunk.", "Seek help.", "You can be interested in someone and then later realize that they cannot consent to anything and decide to help them get home safely with their roommates\u2026\u2026.", "\"I offered her and her friends a ride home and they accepted. It was about a 15 minute drive a few minutes into the drive one said was feeling ill.\"\n\nWho lacks in reading comprehension?\n\nShe wasn't alone.\n\nNot as smart as we thought we were are we now?", "Yes, and you used the implication that \"he WANTED someone inebriated to do something with\". Way to twist the narrative here since there are clearly multiple people around and involved per the post.", "Agreed. Which is what I said in another comment. He should have took it to court when she blocked him the first time.", "Oh yeah. I agree. Surprised the YTA response is the top one.", "Drunk people puke. Don't offer a drink stranger a ride if you don't want to deal with the consequences.", "My advice is unless you know them well, in the future just let drunk people fend for themselves.", "She also wasn\u2019t in her right mind when she accepted a ride/refused to get out of the car because she was scared. Like it certainly sucks that she isn\u2019t paying but it\u2019s not like she was sober and accepted a ride then threw up. \n\nFeel like he should have known the risks of bringing a very drunk person into his car. And if he\u2019s so worried about it legal action would be the way to go rather than harassing someone who agreed to a ride while intoxicated", "We can't know, because he sent \"multiple messages\" after she didn't respond to the first one. Maybe she would have if he hadn't escalated so quickly.", "Plus the only reason he even knows where her house is is because she told him while he was doing her a massive favor", "Maybe it's because I'm a woman but if a random man I've met once shows up at my house demanding money after repeatedly blowing up my phone there's no way in hell I'm answering the door. \n\nIf he's unhinged enough to return 3 times then there's no way of telling whether he's safe to talk to. She's the ah for not paying, but she's absolutely right in refusing to see op after he's stalked her building for days. I'm sure op didn't intend to come across as violent, but she's completely justified in feeling scared and intimidated by his behaviour.", "Not to be offensive in anyway, shape or form, but does that mean that I am an asshole for pretending to not be home and not answering the door to the various organizations that like to come to my house multiple times a week?", "Why does that matter? I've definitely been down to under $300 in my bank account while I was in college and didn't have a job. $100 would absolutely suck at that point. Not saying OP handled it well, but $100 can be significant for a college student with little to no income.", "Assumption of risk bringing a knowingly drunk person in your vehicle", "I'm glad you caught that too... I didn't get that impression at all from OP", "Because it is male vs female. The idea the girl is blameless here is insane.", "Leave someone stranded, at a risk of hurting themselves or getting sexually assaulted, because of a small risk of dealing with puke?\nThis is why nobody should come to Reddit for moral judgments.", "She\u2019s sober now that she\u2019s not taking responsibility for her own actions.", "I don\u2019t think her mindset really matters in this case. She threw up in a persons car and should pay for it to be cleaned.", "That still doesn't mean she's not an asshole for not offering to pay.\n\nAlso, given how she refused to answer his messages and blocked him, I'd say she was the one who escalated initially.", "Even if someone bombards you with messages to get paid it doesn't mean it's reasonable to block them.  What recourse do you have that point besides the courts and showing up where you dropped them off?", "Okay, but why would you not have responded the first time he contacted you on your phone requesting the money? He only \"blew up her phone\" because she was ignoring his (initially) very reasonable requests to discuss the cleaning costs.", "she puked in his car because she was too scared to get out on the side of the road by a car full of people, then rather than be apologetic avoid the situation? I guess it\u2019s too much to expect people to act like adults.", "Yeah, as I woman I was *violently* shaking my head at the phone. She's absolutely an asshole for what she did but what *he* did was actually really scary- I would've gotten more scared each time he showed up.", "3 times in a matter of 5 days. \n\nHe said the incident took place on Saturday. I understand his car got cleaned immediately. But he honestly could\u2019ve waited this out a bit longer before resulting to spamming her phone and going to her house.\n\nEdit: it was actually 4", "Exactly! I never answer the door anyway because it\u2019s normally just me and then my 7 year old daughter. No way in hell I\u2019d let some lunatic do this. I\u2019d call the cops on him and go from there. He\u2019s acting like a complete AH. I get being mad but he took it upon himself to drive her home. And he knew she was super drunk.", "How many cars did you puke in?", "Do you owe these organizations for messing up their car?", "That actually might be true but the fact that the male resorted to extreme measures of stalking is probably part of the problem.", "These people don\u2019t know how social interactions work.", "I don't agree with you. You have your judgment and I have mine.", "The courts. That's it. There's no second option like you claim. Showing up at her house does not constitute reasonable recourse. Take her to small claims court. Don't harass and intimidate a drunk girl for puking in your car.\n\nAnd yes, repeatedly showing up at her house after being turned away multiple times is harassment. She clearly has no intention of communicating with op. He cannot (or rather should not) force that by stalking her building. Legal action is the only morally acceptable choice. Make her pay, don't scare the shit out of her.", "But he left out how much time elapsed between his first messages and his repeated ones. All of the events he describes have taken place in less than two weeks. So in under two weeks he has sent all these messages and gone to her house a minimum of four times. That's very aggressive behavior for trying to get her to pay for cleaning his car.", "But your logic makes no sense.", "I'm still trying to understand your logic.  You say YTA because he escalated it.  I can understand that.  But why does his escalation excuse her from an obligation to clean up her own mess?  She has left him with the bill when he brought her home.  How does that not maker her an AH too?", "It doesn't and that's why you won't get an answer. \ud83e\udd23\n\nESH"]}
