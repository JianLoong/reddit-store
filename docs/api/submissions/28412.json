She just didn't learn nor care?", "I mean 19 seems a bit late to be teaching someone table manners...", "This whole thing is very oddly-written. I have never ever seen \"session\" used to describe people sitting down for a meal. Also, the way you report your daughter talking about \"shitting it out\" is odd: this is just not something a 19-year-old fluent in English would say.\n\nBut I'm going to say YTA because I don't like this kind of behaviour policing in general.", "YTA while shit is a bit abrasive there isn't an age cutoff for saying pee. You're being too uptight.", "YTA, and I refuse to believe this is real LOL", "\"When addressing us\" YTA for this specifically cause I think this shows us the big picture\n\nYou sound fun at parties \ud83d\ude02 wtf.

This is a 19 year old LEGAL adult who you are trying to police there speech. \n\nShe wasn\u2019t sitting there going into deep depth about the process or color or smell of what she did. She simply stated she had to use the restroom in modern language. \n\nI highly suggest you let this one go as this is such a minor thing.

But I think taking like that is pretty normal with friends and family, especially if you\u2019re just at home.", "YTA bruh moment she is 19 pretty late if you ask me. The only one that\u2019s I can say is fair is the word shit but you approach it in the worst way possible just bitching and moaning.

You might be offended by her talking about her bodily functions but that doesn\u2019t make a perfectly acceptable word for \u201curinate\u201d, childish. I can guarantee that she only escalated to telling you that she has to shit, because of your behavior around her telling you that she has to pee. Saying \u201cI have to pee\u201d is no worse than saying \u201cI have to use the bathroom\u201d. \nIf your child doesn\u2019t have table manners, look at yourself, don\u2019t lash out at her. \ud83d\ude02", "YTA.

Her CHOOSING not to use them is disrespectful. If she doesn't care to curb the vulgarity, I see no issue with refusing to be her audience.", "You missed the boat on teaching manner and politeness.  That should have been done at the age of two. Now too late to get pissed. No one to blame except you.", "YTA", "Can't be real surely", "Reminds me of my mother who was so pretentious ehen she heard me say a swear word, she said she felt disgusted to look at me, I'm a girl, I can't cuss.

Or she is saying it to be passive aggressive because she is an angry teenager. IDK which, but if you pay for the house and food, and she does not, then\n\nNTA.\n\nDon't get aggressive to come communicate though. You are a grownup. If she pulls this frequently, the next time she does, take her plate off the table and put it on the counter.

It sounds like you should have been doing this for the last 10 years", "YTA and I'm taking a shit while writing this, and closer in age to you than your daughter. It's not a formal event, it's family dinner. Wise up.", "Good lord that is a disgusting way to speak, not just around meals. A person should never say those words aloud in any circumstance. You should have corrected this behavior 15 years ago. It's way too late now. Your wife is wrong. Her permissiveness explains exactly why your kid is the way she is now.", "NTA, Show her the door, she is 19.  You set a boundary of not using that terminology at the table while eating.

Sounds like you are a little too late.  \n\nWhy doesn't your wife support this?", "YTA. Tell me, what us the difference of her announcing she has to use the bathroom vs her saying brb gotta pee? Is she still not informing you of what she's doing? Would her telling you she has to take a hot piss be better than saying pee?\n\nYou're so sensitive that someone saying the word shit makes you so physically ill your dinner is ruined? \n\nGuess what? Your wife's right. Stop being so uptight about a 19 year old having to pee.", "I mean this with all sincerity: Grow up.  \n\n\nYTA", "Yta. She's 19 and if you haven't done your job of teaching her table manners by now. It's too late.", "She\u2019s triggering you on purpose. Stop reacting.

Whenever she has to use the lavatory while we're lunching or having dinner, she says \"Hold on, I gotta pee\" before leaving. We have told her that, firstly, \"pee\" is a childish word and not something someone of her age should be using. And that secondly, she could say either \"I have to use the bathroom\" or just an \"Excuse me\" (even better).  \nHowever, she doesn't care to listen. During dinner yesterday, however, she started it again. Towards the end of the session she said it didn't look like it had agreed with her and \"I gotta shit it out now, I guess\".  \nI lost my temper, and it was as good as her ruining my food too. I told her very severely that if she can't control her tongue or use proper terminology while addressing us, she would have to leave the dining table and eat in her own room.  \nShe flipped out herself and said I can't control her and that I am being ridiculous, but I told her that it was very important to have table manners and she didn't have any of it. I didn't back down, and in the end she just stormed upstairs. My wife herself says I am overreacting/being ridiculous and that no harm was done by her at all, but it still irks me to hear her use such words and phrases.  \nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You're showing her she can push your buttons.\n\nId advise against that.", "ESH\n\nShe should be more considerate at the table. \n\nYou should have taught her consideration two decades ago.

I'm a few years older than you and I use the word \"pee\" regularly. Imo, there is nothing wrong with this word, and there is no age limit on it, either. But I do agree that words like this are a bit out of place when spoken at the dinner table. A simple \"excuse me\", or something similar, should be sufficient. \n\nAlso, why does she have no table manners? Did you and her mother teach her when she was a child to have proper table manners? If so, is this a newer development as she got older, or has she never had good table manners? If you never taught her table manners, then that's on you, and you can't really blame her for something she was never taught.", "NTA I go through this at family gatherings.  Omg my niece is *exactly* the same way.  She is 21.

Her descriptions of her bowel movements are a thing to behold.  She also lifts her leg, while we're eating, and farts at the dinner table.  Honestly I cant help but laugh by all the heads that whip in her direction in shock and horror.  \n\nMy only take is there is something wrong with that generation.

So she presses that button again because it's amusing to watch you react. \n\nThere's a technique teachers use called planned ignoring where you intentionally decide not to engage with behaviors designed to get attention.
