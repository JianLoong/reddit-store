She was literally arguing about you not letting   \n her taking liberties with your stuff.", "NTA. She brought up it being \u201ceasier than walking to the teacher\u2019s lounge,\u201d which opens the door to your comment. She overstepped.", "NTA.

You were nice to offer it at all and when she pushed beyond what you offered you told her no and why. Given what you said about her having difficulty picking up social cues you were direct and clear.", "Nts she is.  Why are you second guessing when she clearly took advantage and did not respect you?", "NTA. She seems to not take politeness, so being blunt may be the only way to go with her. Why she even brought up the students drinks is rude.", "NTA, letting others use your stuff is the nice thing to do but not to the point where it suddenly gets considered as communal.

Holy crap, that is sooooo selfish of her to do...  You deserve to be able to use the fridge that you bought yourself for your food without someone selfishly crushing the food you put in there.
