It's not your fault that he made a poor financial decision. Eve should be mad at him, not you. He should have been honest with himself and his friends about his budget and not try to impress anyone by splurging on drinks he couldn't afford. You did nothing wrong, you were polite and grateful.

Was he drunk?", "NTA - this sounds like a problem between Eve and Jake that she\u2019s now projecting on to you. He offered, you all declined, he insisted.", "NTA, it\u2019s not your job to manage his finances. You all initially said he didn\u2019t have to cover it but he insisted. It was his money to blow on drinks or save for bills or whatever", "NTA!! Eve needs to point her finger at her financially irresponsible boyfriend.", "NTA. He's old enough to make his own financial decisions. No one forced or encouraged him to pay. He volunteered. He had to be a big shot, had to prove it to the crowd. Now he's sober & rent is due. Boo-hoo...", "NTA he offered to pay, you said no and he still insisted. His girlfriend should be having a go at him and not you", "NTA Jake is a grown up.

He is one of those who buy rounds and leave their entire checks in the pub every friday. \n\nEve is at her wit's end. She picked on you because there is absolutely nothing else she can think of to save herself from this relationship. If you are close, ask her out, apologize for not knowing what the situation really was and listen to her when she starts to cry.", "NTA.  Jake insisted.  You demurred.  He insisted again.  You did the polite thing and accepted his generous offer.  It's not up to you to know what he can and can't afford.  He's a grown man.", "NTA. It sounds like he wanted to be a big shot in front of everyone.", "NTA. He insisted. I'd refrain from sharing a table with him in the future though, not worth the drama.", "His own friends tried to stop him but he wouldn\u2019t listen to anyone. What were you supposed to do?

Or was he drunk out of his mind?\nIt seems he knew Eve was gonna pay for it at the end. He didn't buy you drinks, he forced her to buy you drinks. Sounds like a them problem to me. Maybe he's trying to get back at her for something I don't know.\n\nI would pay Eve my share of the tab then step back out of the blast area.", "This is ridiculous, how old are these people? \nNTA", "NTA   \nJake is a grown man and should take resposibility for **his** choice of deciding on his own to pay for all those drinks.  \nEve should have a talk with Jake about being a bit smarter with money and not blame OP for this.", "NTA he's an adult who can make his own decisions", "NTA.

Leave out the fact his gf called you.\n\nYou aren't responsible if someone is insistent then what can you do except for settle up afterwards if they were drunk at the time.\n\nAddress your friends difficulties with her bf Jake separately and with your friend only, not Jake.

Even in my drunkest, poorest state I make sure I have fare to go home and rent money. That's how making money works when you're an adult. If Jake made the decision to do something, drunk or not, he's going to fuck around and find out that there are consequences to being an idiot. \n\nIf being drunk is something he considers to be more worthwhile than paying his rent, he has a serious problem and needs to get help.\n\nNobody is obliged to pay this dudes rent \ud83e\udd28 You pay for something, or you gift someone something, you have no right to ask for it back because buyers remorse kicks in. \n\nMaybe this is the lesson he needs.", "Please go and re-read the post. No one asked him to pay nor was it expected. He insisted. Was he not aware of his own financial situation? How is it the responsibility of OP? He is an adult and know better than to waste his money on stupid stuff. \n\nPlus he didn't just pay for OP, he paid for the ENTIRE TABLE OF 8.
