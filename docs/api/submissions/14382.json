I didn't think much of it, but we go out to the living room to hang out with the group. She sits on the 4 person couch next to everyone so I sit on the arm chair. She was sitting in between both of her male friends and, while nothing overt happened, I began to feel uncomfortable. I felt like she was wearing some revealing clothing and was awfully close to everyone on the couch. \n\nI let it go and we had a good day the next day. That next night we go to unwind and hang out again. She changed into the same nightgown and she's about to walk out so I stop her. I asked, \"are you wearing that tonight?\" And she said, \"yes I am, why?\". I asked her if she had any other pajamas to wear and she said that was all she brought. So, I asked if she would be willing to change into some spare clothes I had. She said she was comfortable in her nightgown. I told her it would make me feel better if she changed. She didn't really resist and said she would, but then asks me what the reason is for why I want her to change outfits. So I honestly tell her I think it's revealing and it makes me uncomfortable if she wears something like that in front of our friends. She says, \"ok\" and changes into my spare clothes and we go on with the night. \n\nAfter the trip we got into a small argument and she tells me that me making her change clothes was controlling. She felt like I was being overbearing and was encroaching on her freedom to wear/do what she wants. I again told her that I thought it was too revealing and if the roles were reversed she would also be uncomfortable. She said she wouldn't be uncomfortable and that it shouldn't be a big deal because she had no bad intentions and just likes how comfortable the gown is. \n\nSo, AITA for making her not wear her nightgown around our friends?", "created_utc": 1681057276, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12gnvvd/aita_for_making_my_gf_wear_a_different_outfit/", "score": 107, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm sure I will be downvoted to oblivion, but that nightie is meant to be sexually provocative. The whole purpose of wearing it is to arouse your intimate partner. It was inappropriate to wear it in a mixed group, in what was supposed to be a casual get-together. Unless you are swingers, she was sending the wrong message to everyone around her.\n\nI understand people think women should feel free to wear whatever they want in public, but the reality is, clothes do create an image and send a signal about the person wearing them. Her outfit clearly said, \"I want to seduce you.\" The person who designed that outfit meant for it to be seductive.\n\nYou can bet at least some of the other people in the group were embarrassed and didn't know where to look when she appeared in that. They were probably fighting the urge to throw a blanket over her. It's understandable that you were uncomfortable with the vibe she was sending out.\n\nHow would your girlfriend like it if you had worn a pair of short shorts that clearly displayed your scrotum every time you bent over or sat down on the couch? Would she have clapped and cheered about your right to wear anything you wanted? I seriously doubt it. Odds are, she would have felt humiliated.\n\nIt's true she has the right to wear whatever she wants, whenever she wants.

If this is a thing that bothers you and she continues to do this, it is perfectly valid to find a different kind of person.

No one should force people to do things with their body they don't want to do.\n\nBut in a relationship there are expectations. You aren't forced to follow them, we don't stone woman for committing adultery anymore. But if you do cheat, you're the asshole.

Chilling topless at a restaurant, or wearing a bikini to the bank would be different (no matter who you are or who else is there).\n\nWearing lingerie to a casual hangout feels more like the latter situations, and I think it's reasonable for a romantic partner to feel a little weird about it.

Do not trust people who tell you otherwise.\n\nWe live in a society where, for most of history, women were treated as inferiors, to have their lives controlled in every way by men.

Why wouldn\u2019t you just break up? That\u2019s what you told op?", "Maybe I didn't explain the exchange well. She said she had nothing else to wear so I asked if she would wear my spare clothes. She didn't say \"no\", she just asked why I wanted her to do that. When I explained myself she said \"okay\" and changed. There was no initial argument or forcing anyone to do anything.

Your discomfort is TOTALLY reasonable This is SUPER inappropriate clothing for company, especially other guys. Yes, she can choose to wear what she wants, but you are under no obligation to like it. Wearing lingerie with her tits on display is pretty freaking disrespectful to you and your relationship and her \u201cintention\u201d doesn\u2019t matter. It is intended for intimacy and seduction, not for lounging around in mixed company. You have every right to be upset by it, and her pulling the controlling card is gaslighting you to be okay with that disrespect.  \n\nIt seems like you both have wildly different views on where boundaries within the relationship lie, and I\u2019m willing to bet this choice of clothing isn\u2019t the only example of differing views. You two are gonna have to have a serious conversation about all of this if you want to avoid more issues.", "NTA that is not pajamas", "YTA", "Nah, you weren't rude and you didn't force her or shame her. I hope the same respect would have been given if she refused though. I'm reading the comments and it's kinda crazy to me that people are trying to claim she was purposefully being proactive. It's kinda like some of these people haven't seen the influence of lingerie in fashion. It's incredibly common now for women to wear lingerie as regular clothing, lingerie bodysuits have been in style for years now and they are typically worn in casual settings. As well slip dresses have been a major part of fashion for decades now, take the Kinderwhore fashion trends of the 90s for example. I feel like the only reason people think this slip is soo deeply inappropriate is because the breast portion is slightly see-through. But then why is a women showing a little nipple inappropriate when guys can walk around shirtless in public without a problem? Does that not count as exposing yourself to others without their consent? What makes a women's chest inappropriate and not a man's? Women reclaiming the overt sexualization of their bodies has been happening for decades now I personally think it's time for people to acknowledge that the reason a women's chest being exposed is inappropriate, is because of the objectification of women in society. It's not the females responsibility to change, it's societies.", "NTA\n\nShe wore that and sat between both of her male friends? Lol  breaking up with her the next day absolutely 100 percent. That's disrespectful and tells you she is totally oblivious to anything.

Was she trying to get the attention of the other guys in the room?

I can\u2019t imagine that would make her too comfortable.", "YTA do you tell her to cover up when she's at the beach or pool in a bikini?", "Remember the 90\u2019s satin nightgown as dress fad? \nIf she wore only track pants and sport bra would that have been ok?

Evrybody seems to make a big deal out of underwear but seems totally fine with bikinis.", "Honestly given i doubt the boobs were actually sheer on her dress I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal, like yeah I get it black and lace are \u2018traditionally sexy\u2019 but if it covers everything personally I don\u2019t see a fundamental difference between say a long vest/T-shirt like it\u2019s nothing more revealing then someone would wear to the club  (plus in my experience they tend to make those dresses long enough to cover your ass vs the other options)", "Man, if you didn't add the image in the post you would have been torn to shreds by this sub, I'm really surprised how much support there is for NTA.", "NTA.", "NTA whose attention is she seeking and who is she trying to impress? Seems red flag territory.", "not everyone has the same standards to be fair like the top realistically wasn\u2019t sheer and it will\u2019ve likely covered things up more than just a long T shirt \n\nIt\u2019s obviously a bit more sexy or whatever but nothing you wouldn\u2019t see at the club", "yeah, we live in a society and even though there is no official dress code for hanging out with friends, there is a dress code. I\u2019m not gonna wear a swimming dress for a dinner with friends even if they all saw me before in swimsuits.", "It's interesting that you think the equivalent to a woman's chest is the male scrotum. Would the equivalent not be the same part of the male? If he was walking around in shorts with his scrotum exposed, then the appropriate comparison would be her walking around in a skirt/dress with her labia exposed, would it not?", "I have a nightie like one the pic and you can see my nipples through the lace and since it is satin, it goes up when you sit - and it is already short. It also has lace on the rim, so people who sat across her, mostly saw up to her underwear. \n\nThis is nothing for sitting with friends.

We live in a society with literally dress code for every event. This dress meant for seducing your partner, not for an evening with friends. \nLike..most of my friends saw me naked in saunas, but I still wouldn\u2019t walk naked at home while they are there. Because that social situation is different.", "A bikini is appropriate swimwear for that occasion and I'm sure you know that. Lingerie was not appropriate for the occasion OP described. I wouldn't necessarily want to be in a situation where my girlfriend chose specifically to wear lingerie in order to sit between two male friends who are dressed in regular clothes. \nDo you not see a difference?", "Because you wear bikinis on the beach. Unfortunately living with other people means we have to follow social rules and dressing is one of them.", "The image is also very accurate. Some people don't believe that's what it was but it's true.", "are you a child? my god your comments are so embarrassingly stupid it\u2019s kinda funny", "Did you miss that in the sample photo of the outfit in question, the model is wearing something underneath so that nipple isn\u2019t visible, and without said items (as in the case of OPs story) it would basically be OPs GF hanging out with mesh over her breasts?\n\nThat\u2019s not a \u201ccasual hang out with friends\u201d outfit unless they\u2019re friends with benefits, or you\u2019re in a nudist commune, in which case you\u2019d be overdressed!

Second, It's very odd to me that you don't think consent of others is required for someone to walk around nude or in lingerie.

That being said, I don\u2019t think it was malicious. She just doesn\u2019t understand. Whilst voicing your opinion in a clear manner was great, I do think making her change isn\u2019t.

She may choose to wear something because her partner likes it, or not.
