I didn't think much of it, but we go out to the living room to hang out with the group. She sits on the 4 person couch next to everyone so I sit on the arm chair. She was sitting in between both of her male friends and, while nothing overt happened, I began to feel uncomfortable. I felt like she was wearing some revealing clothing and was awfully close to everyone on the couch. \n\nI let it go and we had a good day the next day. That next night we go to unwind and hang out again. She changed into the same nightgown and she's about to walk out so I stop her. I asked, \"are you wearing that tonight?\" And she said, \"yes I am, why?\". I asked her if she had any other pajamas to wear and she said that was all she brought. So, I asked if she would be willing to change into some spare clothes I had. She said she was comfortable in her nightgown. I told her it would make me feel better if she changed. She didn't really resist and said she would, but then asks me what the reason is for why I want her to change outfits. So I honestly tell her I think it's revealing and it makes me uncomfortable if she wears something like that in front of our friends. She says, \"ok\" and changes into my spare clothes and we go on with the night. \n\nAfter the trip we got into a small argument and she tells me that me making her change clothes was controlling. She felt like I was being overbearing and was encroaching on her freedom to wear/do what she wants. I again told her that I thought it was too revealing and if the roles were reversed she would also be uncomfortable. She said she wouldn't be uncomfortable and that it shouldn't be a big deal because she had no bad intentions and just likes how comfortable the gown is. \n\nSo, AITA for making her not wear her nightgown around our friends?", "created_utc": 1681057276, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12gnvvd/aita_for_making_my_gf_wear_a_different_outfit/", "score": 262, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm sure I will be downvoted to oblivion, but that nightie is meant to be sexually provocative. The whole purpose of wearing it is to arouse your intimate partner. It was inappropriate to wear it in a mixed group, in what was supposed to be a casual get-together. Unless you are swingers, she was sending the wrong message to everyone around her.\n\nI understand people think women should feel free to wear whatever they want in public, but the reality is, clothes do create an image and send a signal about the person wearing them. Her outfit clearly said, \"I want to seduce you.\" The person who designed that outfit meant for it to be seductive.\n\nYou can bet at least some of the other people in the group were embarrassed and didn't know where to look when she appeared in that. They were probably fighting the urge to throw a blanket over her. It's understandable that you were uncomfortable with the vibe she was sending out.\n\nHow would your girlfriend like it if you had worn a pair of short shorts that clearly displayed your scrotum every time you bent over or sat down on the couch? Would she have clapped and cheered about your right to wear anything you wanted? I seriously doubt it.

If this is a thing that bothers you and she continues to do this, it is perfectly valid to find a different kind of person.

No one should force people to do things with their body they don't want to do.\n\nBut in a relationship there are expectations. You aren't forced to follow them, we don't stone woman for committing adultery anymore. But if you do cheat, you're the asshole.

Chilling topless at a restaurant, or wearing a bikini to the bank would be different (no matter who you are or who else is there).\n\nWearing lingerie to a casual hangout feels more like the latter situations, and I think it's reasonable for a romantic partner to feel a little weird about it.

If she would, well, that\u2019s just fuckin weird.\n\nEdit to add: my comparison was asking if she truly is dressing for comfort. Like if it\u2019s good enough to wear in front of friends, it should be suitable to wear in front of family.

Why wouldn\u2019t you just break up? That\u2019s what you told op?", "Maybe I didn't explain the exchange well. She said she had nothing else to wear so I asked if she would wear my spare clothes.

As well slip dresses have been a major part of fashion for decades now, take the Kinderwhore fashion trends of the 90s for example. I feel like the only reason people think this slip is soo deeply inappropriate is because the breast portion is slightly see-through.

Women reclaiming the overt sexualization of their bodies has been happening for decades now I personally think it's time for people to acknowledge that the reason a women's chest being exposed is inappropriate, is because of the objectification of women in society.

I still don't agree with you. Perhaps it's because I have had enough life experience to understand why autonomy in relationships is so important and why not letting your partner make their own choices is not the path to a healthy relationship.\n\nAt this point, I am not going to tell you what to do, because that would be controlling. Instead I am going to enforce my own boundary, by managing my  attention and deciding that I don't want you in it right now because I don't have any interest in knowing more about why you think telling your partner what to do is a desirable feature of an intimate relationship.

I am saying one should be careful not to be controlling, if that's not what one wishes to be.  \n\nIt is perfectly reasonable for OP not to want his friends to see his girlfriend in lingerie. He is as free to feel that way as she is free to dress as she chooses.  It is now up to them to figure out how to navigate their autonomy and their personal preferences -- but \"controlling\" their partner should not be a part of that process if they don't want it to be.\n\nI see that you are making a connection between \"lingerie\" --> sexual --> \"lap dance,\" probably because it is easy to mentally tie what a woman wears to her sexual choices, but I can assure you that autonomy in a relationship is an issue that arises outside of those confines as well -- be it with respect to jobs, haircuts, how to park a car, etc.  In each instance, being with a partner who trusts and respects your choices and your autonomy, and feeling secure enough to do the same for them, is a wonderful thing.  \n\nIf you can't trust or respect your partner's choices, or if your partner feels comfortable criticizing your choices, or if you are constantly concerned about whether people's opinion of your partner's choices will reflect poorly on you, then they may not be the right person for you.\n\nHowever, I also acknowledge that some people prefer to be told what to do, and some people feel secure only if they have more control over their partner's choices. There may be opportunity for compatibility there. \n\nIn this case, however, OP's girlfriend made it clear that she actually didn't like being told what to wear, so OP now has to decide whether that's something he needs in this relationship or whether, upon reflection, he really doesn't care that much about it after all.", "Did you just say men can't be victims, because if a woman is comfortable with something, she's no longer considered an offender?", "This logic literally destroys language. I don't enjoy mahong. Stop funizing mahong. Only things I find fun are fun. Funmisunderstanders literally find getting poked with needles and running marathons fun. Ummm arguing on reddit is fun though.\n\nAlso you're a bigot for saying that sex is sexual therefore if i willingly have sex I'm not asexual", "Are you okay? Have you been smoking? I'm sure this made perfect sense in your head.\n\nShe isn't trying to police him. He's trying to police her. They are both perfectly allowed their opinion on any matter, they just aren't allowed to decide what others are and aren't allowed to do. If that is a concept that destroys language, then we need a new language."]}
