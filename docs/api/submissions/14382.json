I didn't think much of it, but we go out to the living room to hang out with the group. She sits on the 4 person couch next to everyone so I sit on the arm chair. She was sitting in between both of her male friends and, while nothing overt happened, I began to feel uncomfortable. I felt like she was wearing some revealing clothing and was awfully close to everyone on the couch. \n\nI let it go and we had a good day the next day. That next night we go to unwind and hang out again. She changed into the same nightgown and she's about to walk out so I stop her. I asked, \"are you wearing that tonight?\" And she said, \"yes I am, why?\". I asked her if she had any other pajamas to wear and she said that was all she brought. So, I asked if she would be willing to change into some spare clothes I had. She said she was comfortable in her nightgown. I told her it would make me feel better if she changed. She didn't really resist and said she would, but then asks me what the reason is for why I want her to change outfits. So I honestly tell her I think it's revealing and it makes me uncomfortable if she wears something like that in front of our friends. She says, \"ok\" and changes into my spare clothes and we go on with the night. \n\nAfter the trip we got into a small argument and she tells me that me making her change clothes was controlling. She felt like I was being overbearing and was encroaching on her freedom to wear/do what she wants. I again told her that I thought it was too revealing and if the roles were reversed she would also be uncomfortable. She said she wouldn't be uncomfortable and that it shouldn't be a big deal because she had no bad intentions and just likes how comfortable the gown is. \n\nSo, AITA for making her not wear her nightgown around our friends?", "created_utc": 1681057276, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12gnvvd/aita_for_making_my_gf_wear_a_different_outfit/", "score": 850, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm sure I will be downvoted to oblivion, but that nightie is meant to be sexually provocative. The whole purpose of wearing it is to arouse your intimate partner. It was inappropriate to wear it in a mixed group, in what was supposed to be a casual get-together. Unless you are swingers, she was sending the wrong message to everyone around her.\n\nI understand people think women should feel free to wear whatever they want in public, but the reality is, clothes do create an image and send a signal about the person wearing them. Her outfit clearly said, \"I want to seduce you.\" The person who designed that outfit meant for it to be seductive.\n\nYou can bet at least some of the other people in the group were embarrassed and didn't know where to look when she appeared in that. They were probably fighting the urge to throw a blanket over her. It's understandable that you were uncomfortable with the vibe she was sending out.\n\nHow would your girlfriend like it if you had worn a pair of short shorts that clearly displayed your scrotum every time you bent over or sat down on the couch? Would she have clapped and cheered about your right to wear anything you wanted? I seriously doubt it.

If this is a thing that bothers you and she continues to do this, it is perfectly valid to find a different kind of person.

No one should force people to do things with their body they don't want to do.\n\nBut in a relationship there are expectations. You aren't forced to follow them, we don't stone woman for committing adultery anymore. But if you do cheat, you're the asshole.

Chilling topless at a restaurant, or wearing a bikini to the bank would be different (no matter who you are or who else is there).\n\nWearing lingerie to a casual hangout feels more like the latter situations, and I think it's reasonable for a romantic partner to feel a little weird about it.

Why wouldn\u2019t you just break up? That\u2019s what you told op?", "Maybe I didn't explain the exchange well. She said she had nothing else to wear so I asked if she would wear my spare clothes.

As well slip dresses have been a major part of fashion for decades now, take the Kinderwhore fashion trends of the 90s for example. I feel like the only reason people think this slip is soo deeply inappropriate is because the breast portion is slightly see-through.

Women reclaiming the overt sexualization of their bodies has been happening for decades now I personally think it's time for people to acknowledge that the reason a women's chest being exposed is inappropriate, is because of the objectification of women in society.

To an indirect communicator, requests are often seen as significantly more forceful than they actually are, because frequently indirect communicators won't even make requests unless it's a big deal. You asked for something directly rather than by implication. To someone with an indirect communication style that's a decent amount of force.\n\nNow, I say this as a woman who has to fight constantly with my own brain about this, indirect communication styles are stupid? They're bad. They require that people read your mind and require that you read other people's minds. I grew up in a space where they were the norm and have moved to a space where we all try really hard not to do that shit because it's a cool recipe for anxiety. But.\n\nIt's not unlikely that your girlfriend perceived your request as more of a command than it was. It's not unlikely that your girlfriend did not feel she was able to refuse without it becoming a fight. It's very possible that what she's trying to tell you isn't \"you should never have made this request,\" it's \"I felt pressured into changing my behavior when I didn't want to and I felt the application of pressure was unfair.\" If that's the case, you're going to want to find that out and figure out how you can make a gentle request in a way that feels gentle to her.\n\nLast note, you don't feel like she understands your values, and she may or may not. But you're also not really making any attempt to understand hers? You're operating out of a certain set of well accepted norms, and as a result large numbers of strangers are more likely to back your values than hers. But that doesn't actually make them right anymore than it would make hers right if it went the other way? Like these are her friends. Maybe the people she chooses to spend time with are more like her than they are like the majority of Reddit users. Maybe this is not an etiquette problem in her space. Which means that this isn't a her versus society problem--society isn't relevant. It's a her versus you problem. And if you want to resolve that in a way that's satisfactory to both of you you both have to put in the work to actually understand where the other person is coming from and decide what you will and won't put up with from a romantic partner. It's super valid if in her community she doesn't want to be restricted by the male gaze, and I don't share your values but it's also super valid for you to want certain things to be private and intimate.

It sounded like the vibe here was comfy pjs, and OP\u2019s girlfriend either doesn\u2019t own any, has only ever worn sexy lingerie and thinks it\u2019s pjs, or is hoping to get some sort of reaction \u2014 from friends, boyfriend, all of them. \n\nI do feel like it\u2019s fair for OP to communicate the discomfort, but he should also think about why he is so uncomfortable \u2014 does he not trust his girlfriend? It\u2019s also fair that the girlfriend could see this as controlling behavior if she honestly only ever wears teddys as pjs and doesn\u2019t really think of them as anything. It\u2019s also not clear if there was another seating option besides the couch and single chair, like two separate chairs or a love seat. Maybe the only spot for her to sit was in between the guy friends. It\u2019s weird for many of us, but I\u2019d hesitate to say she\u2019s definitely the AH without more info. OPs not the AH though, unless he misrepresented how he talked to his girlfriend.", "OP said she was only in panties. That\u2019s not great coverage.", "No fr\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d", "Right?! If one of my friends wore that to hang out, we\u2019d all be like \u201cdude where are your pants?!\u201d", "Yeah that\u2019s why women stay in + have poker nights in their tracksuits rather than going out  in minus 10 degrees in just a dress + impractical footwear. But, keep telling yourself that she was just doing it \u201cfor herself\u201d. If so, that means she wears it when she\u2019s completely by herself, when she\u2019s ironing or knitting. Bullshit", "Everyone feeling like they\u2019re allowed to have an opinion on what a woman is wearing. Saying it\u2019s suspicious she\u2019d wear this around friends who happen to be male.", "I don\u2019t want my female friends wearing this when I\u2019m hanging out with them and other females.  Im female", "I tend to agree with you. It would make me uncomfortable. Unless she\u2019s hinting at opening the relationship this weekend and OP is the only one who hasn\u2019t figured it out yet.", "That was my first thought too lol", "I wanna know this too bc silky/lacey nightgown dresses and tops were all the rage growing up and have started coming back into fashion again.", "I can believe she wears it when she's by herself... again, women dress for themselves most of the time, and not for men, so even when out in a dress in the winter most of the time that's women dressing up for themselves. Especially as in this case she was with her male FRIENDS so it's rather negative of you to assume she was trying to entice them in some way all while taken and in a relationship", "Or on the street, or out shopping. The ridiculousness goes on.", "There are dozens of us. Dozens!", "Or one boob falls right out\u2026definitely not a comfortable \u201clets sleep\u201d kind of outfit", "She wanted all eyes and attention on her,  she wanted guys jerkin off over her, + also suggests her interest in OP is waning, u don\u2019t risk pissing your bf like that if you\u2019re absolutely enamoured with him. Pretty sure the other girls there were over the moon about their bfs drooling over her as well. If so, why don\u2019t girls stay at home and just have a disco in their living room? #strawman. That\u2019s a nightdress, and it\u2019s basically soft porn to  any straight guy with a pulse, irrespective of why she\u2019s wearing it. Don\u2019t get me wrong , I love it and have no issue with girls going to clubs in short skirts, but don\u2019t lie and say it\u2019s not for male attention, or that it was appropriate in this \u201cgroup hang non club\u201d situation. + pretty sure she has a thing for another guy in the social circle", "That's literally the entire basis of monogamy.", "That is a SLIP or a slip dress.", "She was sitting in sheer lingerie with no underwear next to two male friends. Unless they have some kind of open relationship or exhibitionism thing going, she was being wildly disrespectfull to OP and their relationship.\n\nHint: what you wear can be making a statement other than \"I like these clothes\"", "Or she just likes it because it's comfortable? Without knowing if her and her friends care less about this kind of thing/what everyone else was wearing, it's overly cynical to jump to the conclusion she was doing it for attention and all the other bfs were drooling over her (i.e. everyone involved is disloyal)", "Literally not.", "Which is typically considered lingerie. Babydolls, slips, negligees usually fall under the category of lingerie. You're not going to find this kind of thing in a clothing store that doesn't sell bras/underwear/lingerie in general. Like are you seriously trying to argue this isn't lingerie? If the sole purpose of an item is to be worn to bed/for sexy times and the garment is seductive, it's lingerie by definition.", "It\u2019s one thing to communicate and another to pressure her into changing. Changing wasn\u2019t HER choice. Also, wasn\u2019t this their home ?", "And? They had guests over. I don\u2019t know how you live your life but I tend not to wear lingerie when I have guests over.", "It has nothing to do with trust, it\u2019s about respect. Just like he wouldn\u2019t walk around topless in front of friends, as he stated he wouldn\u2019t, he hopes that his partner would show the same level of respect towards him. \n\nSaying I\u2019m going to do whatever because I can is a very juvenile way of thinking. Giving and receiving respect is very important, and basic element in social situations and relationships. And just doing what you like regardless of who you hurt isn\u2019t mature or taking a stand. \n\nShe literally wore sexy, see through lingerie. Not a crop top and shorts with no bra. It is absolutely completely different. And unless your partner is okay with it you shouldn\u2019t do it. He\u2019s not policing her, he\u2019s asking for a tiny bit of respect."]}
