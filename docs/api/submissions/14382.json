I didn't think much of it, but we go out to the living room to hang out with the group. She sits on the 4 person couch next to everyone so I sit on the arm chair. She was sitting in between both of her male friends and, while nothing overt happened, I began to feel uncomfortable. I felt like she was wearing some revealing clothing and was awfully close to everyone on the couch. \n\nI let it go and we had a good day the next day. That next night we go to unwind and hang out again. She changed into the same nightgown and she's about to walk out so I stop her. I asked, \"are you wearing that tonight?\" And she said, \"yes I am, why?\". I asked her if she had any other pajamas to wear and she said that was all she brought. So, I asked if she would be willing to change into some spare clothes I had. She said she was comfortable in her nightgown. I told her it would make me feel better if she changed. She didn't really resist and said she would, but then asks me what the reason is for why I want her to change outfits. So I honestly tell her I think it's revealing and it makes me uncomfortable if she wears something like that in front of our friends. She says, \"ok\" and changes into my spare clothes and we go on with the night. \n\nAfter the trip we got into a small argument and she tells me that me making her change clothes was controlling. She felt like I was being overbearing and was encroaching on her freedom to wear/do what she wants. I again told her that I thought it was too revealing and if the roles were reversed she would also be uncomfortable. She said she wouldn't be uncomfortable and that it shouldn't be a big deal because she had no bad intentions and just likes how comfortable the gown is. \n\nSo, AITA for making her not wear her nightgown around our friends?", "created_utc": 1681057276, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12gnvvd/aita_for_making_my_gf_wear_a_different_outfit/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm sure I will be downvoted to oblivion, but that nightie is meant to be sexually provocative. The whole purpose of wearing it is to arouse your intimate partner. It was inappropriate to wear it in a mixed group, in what was supposed to be a casual get-together. Unless you are swingers, she was sending the wrong message to everyone around her.\n\nI understand people think women should feel free to wear whatever they want in public, but the reality is, clothes do create an image and send a signal about the person wearing them. Her outfit clearly said, \"I want to seduce you.\" The person who designed that outfit meant for it to be seductive.\n\nYou can bet at least some of the other people in the group were embarrassed and didn't know where to look when she appeared in that. They were probably fighting the urge to throw a blanket over her. It's understandable that you were uncomfortable with the vibe she was sending out.\n\nHow would your girlfriend like it if you had worn a pair of short shorts that clearly displayed your scrotum every time you bent over or sat down on the couch? Would she have clapped and cheered about your right to wear anything you wanted? I seriously doubt it. Odds are, she would have felt humiliated.\n\nIt's true she has the right to wear whatever she wants, whenever she wants.

If this is a thing that bothers you and she continues to do this, it is perfectly valid to find a different kind of person. I would hope she finds someone who doesn't mind what she does. \n\nYou have some thinking to do. Idk if there are other things that bother you about her. However, if this is a big deal to you and it is going to bother you a lot then you either need to find someone else or find a way to look past this. \n\nAgain NTA, because your concerns are valid and it looks like you went about it alright.

Haha. \n\n\nBut yeah, agree.", "Asking someone to change is not AH. Fighting about it and refusing to move forward until you get them to change is AH.

No one should force people to do things with their body they don't want to do.\n\nBut in a relationship there are expectations. You aren't forced to follow them, we don't stone woman for committing adultery anymore. But if you do cheat, you're the asshole.

Chilling topless at a restaurant, or wearing a bikini to the bank would be different (no matter who you are or who else is there).\n\nWearing lingerie to a casual hangout feels more like the latter situations, and I think it's reasonable for a romantic partner to feel a little weird about it.

Do not trust people who tell you otherwise.\n\nWe live in a society where, for most of history, women were treated as inferiors, to have their lives controlled in every way by men. Now, we're moving away from this, which means sometimes, you'll see overcorrections, where people are so eager to fight against the controlling behaviour of men of the past, that they incorrectly label basic boundaries and self-respect as controlling.", "this is pretty cuckphobic of you", "Could it be that it was very hot and she only had that to wear in such hot weather?", "Exactly. These people overuse that shit to justify things that might hurt their partners. The OP wasn\u2019t even being insecure, just expressing his discomfort.", "Exactly.

Maybe you aren't as close as you think.", "And you were perfectly fine to voice your concern.

He controlled her", "yeah we were just in the same bed cuddling together because it was sooooo cold, gotta preserve body heat you know", "But why would you be an asshole big baby and tell him your uncomfortable? Why wouldn\u2019t you just break up? That\u2019s what you told op?", "Maybe I didn't explain the exchange well. She said she had nothing else to wear so I asked if she would wear my spare clothes. She didn't say \"no\", she just asked why I wanted her to do that. When I explained myself she said \"okay\" and changed. There was no initial argument or forcing anyone to do anything. It was after the trip when she said it felt controlling.", "So in 2023 relationships can only go one argument -> either fully agree with your partner or break up?", "My dick's part of my body.\n\nI thought my body wasn't something I had to hide from people if I don't want to?", "It's not even wearing a speedo. It's much more coverage then that.", "Eh we've been happily together 7 years and he's never once complained what I wear.

I\u2019ve read 1000s of posts of men making women uncomfortable and it has never once been the woman\u2019s fault according to Reddit? Why is that?", "Lmao, if you really think my partner would be an asshole to want to stop me when I was showing my cock and balls to various people hanging out at my house, I'm at a loss for words.", "Don't be with the woman who wears revealing clothes if you don't wanna be with the girl who wear revealing clothes.", "In my mouth usually.", "Wow.

Otherwise, your answers are strictly by a case by case representation.  What you call a nightgown, others may call lingerie and not for widespread consumption.  Or perhaps you feel that it is ok to wear her lingerie but not to be nestled between her two male friends. Why don\u2019t you elaborate?", "Manspreading, wearing pants to show bulge, speedo at the pool/beach, walking out in boxers, etc  that\u2019s what\u2019s described as creepy not drooling and stalker vibes.", "Your partner really does not get a say in your dressing choices.", "I don\u2019t think there\u2019s an issue with the nightgown. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s an issue with her sitting next to her friends. I think OP is manipulative and borderline controlling.
