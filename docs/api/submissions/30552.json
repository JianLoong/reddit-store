{"id": 30552, "submission_id": "17qiadn", "title": "AITA for not letting my pregnant niece move in?", "selftext": "I 37f and hubby 42 m have 5 kids 18m, 16f, 11f, 8m, 5m. We have recently moved into our dream house. A large 5 bedroom, 3 bathroom home with a huge backyard that has a extra 2 bedroom granny flat. A few days ago my sister law turns up with her kids 16f, 13m, 13f,  10f, 7f, 5m. SILs kids start running amok so I send them outside to the play ground that's came with the house while giving SIL a tour. When we get to the back yard she notices the granny flat and asks who's living there. I tell her that 18m is. She asks to see it but I refuse as he is at work and I'm not going to invade his space. She huffs and isn't happy but due to previous experiences she knows not to push it because I'll just make her leave. After more then a few comments on how it must be nice to be able to give my all my kids their own rooms and even let 18m his own flat, how it sucks that her kids are stuck sharing rooms in their 4 bedroom housing commission house etc. I'm not in the mood as they had turned up unannounced, whined that they couldn't swim in the pool as my husband hadn't treated it yet and I didn't have what they wanted to eat for lunch and refused to order McDonald's for them. I finally got them to leave and hoped they wouldn't be back for quite a while. Unfortunately I was wrong. Yesterday SIL and her 16f turned up at 8am. As it's a public holiday in my state, my youngest 3 and I are just having breakfast, while my older 2 are still asleep. SIL catch's my hubby heading to work. I hear yelling from out the front and find SIL screaming at hubby. In all the yelling coming from SIL I find out that SIL wants her 16f to move into the granny flat as they've just found out she's 15 weeks pregnant. She claims that since they're already overcrowded and don't have the room for a baby, 16f is moving into the flat so I can help with the baby when she goes back to school, my 18m will need to share a room with one of his siblings or move out, she won't be paying rent and we are now responsible for  everything she and the baby will need. My hubby continues to shut her down and tells her that we're not responsible for her or her daughters mistakes and we are not kicking our son out of the flat he pays rent for. After a few minutes of both SIL and her daughter yelling at us they finally realize they're not getting anywhere and leave. They have been posting on social media and whinging to my in-laws and anyone else who will listen about how cruel we are for abandoning niece in her time of need, that we have plenty of room and how we are in a financial situation that I can quit my job to look after the baby so she can get the education she deserves etc. most people are on our side but there's a few saying we're TA. So what do you think AITA for not letting her move in?", "created_utc": 1699437171, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17qiadn/aita_for_not_letting_my_pregnant_niece_move_in/", "score": 673, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

THEY WANT YOU TO QUIT YOUR JOB do not do this !!!! They are so entitled. If anyone complains tell them that they should just help niece then since it\u2019s so important to them.\n\nPLEASE FO NOT GIVE UP YOUR LIFE TO RAISE NIECE\u2019S BABY \n\nYOU ALREADY RAISED FIVE KIDS", "NTA! It isn\u2019t your problem that your niece got pregnant.", "So SIL is whinging about how you \"abandoned\" your niece in her time of need because you won't let SIL abandon her pregnant daughter with you for you to help instead...\n\nAbsolutely NTA. Make sure your son knows so that he can put his foot down too and doesn't come home to the SIL and niece moving his stuff out of the flat.\n\nThey sound so entitled and at this point low to no contact sounds like the best idea to deal with them.", "H'mm, your SIL had it all worked out didn't she?  Unload all the problems of a pregnant teenager onto you.  You give up your job, and no doubt you and your husband will cover all financial costs while SIL sails off into the sunset without a care in the world.  No you definitely are not TA.

How dare she tell YOU what YOU'RE going to do with/in YOUR own home. I'll be damned.", "NTA.  Your sister in law is jealous of your life, riding your coattails and is most likely a serial narcissist from the sounds of it.", "NTA, not by a long shot.

Yes, it's nice. But also, I'm guessing, you didn't just win that house on a scratch card. You and your husband worked hard to be able to afford it. \n\nSIL didn't visit you to be nice. She came to scope up what she can demand from you. Screw that noise and that entitlement.", "NTA.  The irony here is, the best way you can support that pregnant child is to make her life as difficult as possible.  Stupid games win stupid prizes.  If she hasn't learned that YET, then you are awesome for helping to drive that point home.\n\nAnd on a side note, did the 16f parents happen to let her 18m boyfriend move in with them recently?  Just wondering if this post is possibly related to another recent post.", "NTA Obviously\n\nShe accuses you of abandoning her daughter in her time of need and then tries to abandon her daughter with you and expects it all for free and for you to stop working to look after a baby!\n\nYeah right!\n\nYour SIL is an entitled AH", "HELL NO!!!

I feel for the pregnant niece but you are not responsible for her, I would be worried that if I gave in a little to any of the SIL demands or offered help it would be taken for granted and over used. \n\nStick your ground!!", "NTA", "Nta unless someone in your house is that kids sire then you don't owe her crap. She decided to ruin her life now she can pay for her mistakes", "NTA. Not in any way your responsibility.", "NTA holy hell they are so entitled!

You are not responsible for her children on top of your five. People are so weird.", "NTA  no way no how, your SIL is very rude and is acting very entitled.  You don't owe her or her family financial or physical support.  With 4 kids of her own, it's time to grow up.  If she wants better she needs to do better and not expect others to simply hand it to her.", "i would be so embarressed if my mother did something like that, cant imagine joining the shouting. WTF. tell 18m to build a barbed electro fence and hire some guards, not that some pests setlle in. \n\nNTA i can even fathom their mental gymnastics", "NTA!! Not in the least! Your SIL failed her kids and is trying to dump the problem on you.", "Wow the victim card runs strong in your SIL and niece. Don\u2019t fall for their crap - NTA. They likely think you and your husband live the way you do because \u2018you\u2019re lucky\u2019 and they\u2019ve just been \u2018unlucky\u2019 so you should share. Obviously you\u2019ve worked hard and they make bad decisions. Let them both live with their consequences, as you shouldn\u2019t have to by guilted or shamed for not sacrificing your own children or life for them. Not to mention, if you say yes to this, it\u2019ll only get 1000% times worse and in the long run solve nothing.", "NTA don't have room for kids? Don't have more kids. Your daughter gets pregnant, guess who's problem she is? Not the aunt and uncle just because they have a bigger house but you guessed it her own parents", "NTA, absolutely, and warn your oldest kids, especially 18 yo, about their plan. You niece might contact your son to guilt trip him into agreeing.", "I actually want to hear the other side of the story so I can figure out how on earth the think they have a right to act like this!", "NTA. The audacity!", "NTA the only one abandoning your niece is her mother.", "NTA\n\nHere's the list of things SIL is demanding of you: \n\n1. Rearrange your home and children's room situation so her daughter can move in. She even went as far as saying your own child can move out. \n\n2. Fully financially support your niece and the baby without any compensation. \n\n3. Quit your job to raise the niece's baby so she can continue going to school. I'm sure SIL is including post-secondary schooling in this plan. \n\nSIL did not ask if you would be willing to do any of this. She simply decided that you would do what she wanted. The absolute audacity of this woman. Go tell her to kick rocks.", "NTA", "Nta.  Who the heck said you're AH??  Tell those monkeys to take charge.  Dumb people dumb circle", "You are not the assholes.", "NTA. Was SIL raised in a barn? Dropped on her head as a baby? Damn she is a self-absorbed individual. \n\nNot your problem! Next! Tell her that next time she comes over to make a scene or over welcomed, cops will be called. I have zero time for people like her. She is exactly why I live in a gated community.

Just because your choices/circumstances allow you to be more comfortable than your SIL does not mean you owe her anything.  And good on your hubby for shutting her down right away! Of course you are NTA.", "NTA. even if it might be nice to help put they seems like a self destructive and toxic bunch. Don't let them drag you down", "Hahaha..NTA. maybe, they should have spent $5 for condoms.", "So, some people, I assume from your family and hubby's, think it's alright for you to quit your job, make your 18yo go back into teenaged standing instead of starting to adulting, house your niece and a future baby without any compensation... I do have some difficulties seeing how that can be  thought raisonnable...\n\nThey don't have room for her ? Do the question about whether keeping the baby have been asked ? Why the monetary burden should be on you ? Why the burden, all of it or part of it should be on you ?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReally, keep them out of your house and, more importantly, coach your own kids on it, that the 18yo isn't contacted by SIL to leave their rooms...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're so NTA", "Sounds like mom is abandoning daughter in her time of need\u2026\n\nTell her you gave birth to 5 kids not 6\u2026 financial and emotional responsibility for her child is on her and baby daddy.. \n\nTalk about entitled..\n\nNTA at all\u2026", "I would not offer anything.

I would block every single person on social media. I would send her one last message that if she EVER steps foot on your property again you will have her trespassed. Niece can get an abortion. But she will not. She will end up just like mommy. Do not let them pollute your kids.", "LOL. NTA. Where do people get this sense of entitlement, and how can I develop as thick a skin as these people?", "wtf? Of course you\u2019re NTA!", "NTA- your husband is spot on. You are not responsible for other\u2019s mistakes.\n\nSIL is pushing her problems onto you. This is something she should be dealing with.", "Hell to the NTA.

You would be taking away from son if you let your niece move in. What\u2019s next, your nephew wants to move in with his pregnant gf??

Your home is your space, and your sister-in-law doesn't have the right to demand accommodation and support from you, especially when it significantly disrupts your family's living situation. You have every right to maintain boundaries and protect your son's living arrangements in the granny flat, which he's rightfully paying for. Your sister-in-law's expectations, particularly the assumption that you should care for her daughter's child and the demands on your family resources, are unreasonable. You and your husband handled the situation appropriately by asserting your boundaries and not allowing yourself to be coerced into something you're uncomfortable with. Your family's well-being and your son's rights to his living space should be your top priorities. The support you provide should be your choice, not a demand from others. Most people seem to agree with you, and their support suggests that you are handling the situation reasonably.", "So many kids... you people never heard of human overpopulation and birth control?", "NTA for refusing to let her move in but YTA for charging an 18-year-old rent.", "YTA for posting a wall of text.", "NTA at all for the situation - but don\u2019t refer to your niece being pregnant as her needing to take responsibility \u2018for her mistakes\u2019. Ooff that word in relation to a child gets me! She needs to take responsibility for her decisions, yes. \nBut NTA overall - don\u2019t let them move in. It\u2019s your house.", "NTA you should not take your niece in! \n\nI think the best thing you and your husband can do is have a long honest talk with your niece. Explain how much time, effort and sleep deprivation a baby brings. Tell her to do her own research from other parents. Explain that having a baby will probably set her education back by years & how much the average child costs per year. Then tell her she can put the baby up for adoption (closed or open) or keep it. The consequences will be hers. You will not be supporting this child in anyway. \n\nSometimes honesty is the kindest gift you can give. When my cousin was pregnant I told her the truth. She had 3 choices and all of them were going to hurt. (She wasn\u2019t that far along hence abortion was on the table.) Abortion: hurts a bit physically and you may regret it later. Adoption you will miss your baby but you will know they are having a great life in a loving home that can provide for them. Keep the baby, you will have to put going to college on hold until the baby is at least two, potty trained and can go to daycare. (Unless she has the $ for a nanny or infant daycare which costs a lot of money.) Not to mention the cost/stress of having a baby/child.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We have recently moved into our dream house. A large 5 bedroom, 3 bathroom home with a huge backyard that has a extra 2 bedroom granny flat. A few days ago my sister law turns up with her kids 16f, 13m, 13f,  10f, 7f, 5m. SILs kids start running amok so I send them outside to the play ground that's came with the house while giving SIL a tour. When we get to the back yard she notices the granny flat and asks who's living there. I tell her that 18m is. She asks to see it but I refuse as he is at work and I'm not going to invade his space. She huffs and isn't happy but due to previous experiences she knows not to push it because I'll just make her leave. After more then a few comments on how it must be nice to be able to give my all my kids their own rooms and even let 18m his own flat, how it sucks that her kids are stuck sharing rooms in their 4 bedroom housing commission house etc. I'm not in the mood as they had turned up unannounced, whined that they couldn't swim in the pool as my husband hadn't treated it yet and I didn't have what they wanted to eat for lunch and refused to order McDonald's for them. I finally got them to leave and hoped they wouldn't be back for quite a while. Unfortunately I was wrong. Yesterday SIL and her 16f turned up at 8am. As it's a public holiday in my state, my youngest 3 and I are just having breakfast, while my older 2 are still asleep. SIL catch's my hubby heading to work. I hear yelling from out the front and find SIL screaming at hubby. In all the yelling coming from SIL I find out that SIL wants her 16f to move into the granny flat as they've just found out she's 15 weeks pregnant. She claims that since they're already overcrowded and don't have the room for a baby, 16f is moving into the flat so I can help with the baby when she goes back to school, my 18m will need to share a room with one of his siblings or move out, she won't be paying rent and we are now responsible for  everything she and the baby will need. My hubby continues to shut her down and tells her that we're not responsible for her or her daughters mistakes and we are not kicking our son out of the flat he pays rent for.

If you are not responsible enough to ensure that you know you are pregnant IF you are pregnant, then you are not mature enough to have sex. Niece should've realised she was pregnant a lot sooner but probably chose to ignore the symptoms, and for sure didn't take a regular pregnancy test just in case (a smart thing to do considering that she is sexually active). She probably takes after her mother...

AND that since women have a lot more at stake, they should be more careful.  Like, how can you have an oopsie unprotected moment with 4 guys at the same time and be surprised you get consequences. \n\nBut I do think 'most women' is a really warped view on the world, and indeed misogynistic.", "Yep, unfortunately like mother like daughter", "We've already warned them. They are not to turn up with out being invited and we will not hesitate to call the cops if anything happens. We've also alerted the neighbours and have been told if anything happens to our security cameras they both have cameras", "We have been low contact for a while before this. Silly me wanted to at least try to be civil as it's a small town", "Doesn't mean you have to have anything to do with her.", "Is it possible to get a restraining order?\n\nYou are 1000 x NTA\n\nAs summed up above, not your circus not your monkeys.\n\nWhere do people get the audacity!\n\nEnjoy your dream home and the beautiful life you\u2019ve worked hard to provide your family.", "What else has this woman put you through?! If it went through the courts can you just call the police?  \nYou\u2019re NTA and I\u2019m glad to hear it doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019ll be able to guilt you and your husband into changing your minds.\n\nETA: My condolences about your dad.", "Yep the restraining orders sounds like a very good idea. No contact doesn\u2019t mean you may not see them in the street but it does mean you just ignore them and don\u2019t engage with their bs.", "yeah good ol' people breaking in to your house hurt themselves and you are liable for the incompentense", "Tell niece she can go on CL ffs. You're not her Mother or her bank.", "Oh somehow I\u2019m not surprised this happened in Australia. Yeah Australian laws can be whack and your SIL also sounds whack", "What about a moat filled with crocodiles?", "Wtf they tried to claim YOUR home?! Who are these absolute weirdos?! I cant fathom how anyone can do that?", "Wtf?! I thought my family was over the top\u2026", "This is DERANGED!!!!", ">Both got physical (didn't end well for either of them, deemed self defense on my part) and they both ended up with fines, good behavior bonds and community service \n\n**omg lol**", "If I were you, I would refuse to let SIL or MIL in your yard or house if they show up. No house tours or being friendly. If you give an inch, they will take a mile. You need to stick to being NC with them. I really don\u2019t understand why you let SIL in your house and gave her a tour? She\u2019d already trespassed and stolen from your previous home.\n\nLet\u2019s not forget that you had to defend yourself from them physically attacking you. Why are you even speaking to these people?", "I'm ssufes there's an app to use instead of notching our bedpost these days. Then again guys are too simple minded to realise it \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\n(Hipe no one comes at me for that simple minded comment, u was just using hubby's words when it was brought up in a joke with his mates).", ">Women don't keep track with notches.\n\nNope.  Apparently, it's easier to count missed periods.", "My thoughts exactly!", "Isn't it this thing invented by bad women who want to go out wearing a skirt without being touched, drink without being r*ped, work and being paid equal... Sooooo delusional/s", "Sure.  The way it's used today, it means some guy dared to call out some girl for outrageous behavior.", "[deleted]", "So you screwed up, correctly?  (ducking and running for cover)\n\nSeriously.  At least you deserve credit for not having to wonder whodunnit....", ">But I do think 'most women' is a really warped view on the world, and indeed misogynistic.\n\nIt only seems that way if you really haven't been paying attention.  Even over the past few years, thing have gotten so much worse in just about every way imaginable, as well as some too horrible to contemplate.", "Civil is not dropping in uninvited expecting to be fed and entertained.", "Unfortunately that happens here gotta love the law in Australia sometimes", "When the Incel shows up and announces he\u2019s an  Incel without actually saying it! Lol!", "No it means the same thing it always has and your comment is a prime example of it.", "... What delusional hell hole did you come from? Sex ed is encouraged for safe sex because teens are going to have sex regardless, doesn't mean it's \"encouraged\" to have sex, we just don't pretend it's not going to happen and instead prepare teens with information.\n\nAlso, teen pregnancy rates have been falling for decades and are still going down...", "Teenage pregnancy rates are lower than ever before", "\ud83e\udd23 while we didn't plan on having kids so quickly, all ours are planned and I only have one baby daddy. No judgement to those who have multiple, I'm defiantly in the \"know who your kids dad's are\" camp. I really lucked out with a amazing hubby just not so much his family", "You are genuinely awful", "Cameras aren\u2019t enough. I\u2019d go ahead and get a restraining order in case she tries to pull something like that and make you and your family liable.", "Came to say \u201cFound the incel!\u201d", ">I really lucked out with a amazing hubby just not so much his family\n\nYeah, it seems so.", "He is a amazing person and dad no thanks to MIL and SIL."]}
