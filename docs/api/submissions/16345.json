My sister (29F) Mia has a 3-year-old daughter that she\u2019s planning to bring along. Mia also has an infant son and she only breastfeeds him. Anytime I come visit her, she always breastfeeds and covers herself with a yellow or white blanket over the baby. It was fine with me around since a baby needs to eat, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate for my son to see that, let alone some of his other cousins and friends.\n\nI texted Mia and told her that if she\u2019s going to the party, she should feed the baby with formula. I said I didn\u2019t want her breastfeeding because there are children there. She told me she didn\u2019t see the issue since she covers up her breast and the baby with a blanket or towel, but I told you that things can slip out especially once you\u2019re done feeding the baby.\n\nMy sister said that I\u2019m acting like an absolute child and that the kids at the party aren\u2019t going to care. I just didn\u2019t want to take my chances and I told her to feed the baby formula or don\u2019t come. She said she was going to go anyway if I talked to her like that.\n\nMy ex-wife is furious and thinks I\u2019m treating my sister like shit.

Your sister is also covering herself/baby while nursing so there is no reason why she shouldn\u2019t be able to attend simply because you\u2019d prefer her not to breastfeed her child while COVERED! Also regarding formula more than likely the baby wouldn\u2019t take to it especially if they\u2019ve never had any nor been exposed to a bottle, so your sister trying to do that would probably cause more of an issue/disruption than simply breastfeeding her son the way she typically does.", "YTA, you lost me at \u201cnaturally feed\u201d lmao.

If that baby has only had breast milk his whole life, you don\u2019t know how he would react to formula. There is also the issue of nipple confusion, he may not take it at all, it could cause a breastfeeding strike etc. If she already normally covers herself then there should be no issue as I assume she will cover herself at the party as well. I\u2019m sure your child has seen women covering themselves while breastfeeding in public before, or if you let them on the internet I\u2019m sure they\u2019ve seen worse.

If you know how \u201enormal\u201c people look naked, you have a healthier and more kind look at your own body. If the only people you see naked are pornstars and photoshopped models you are a lot more critical about how you should look like to be pretty.\n\nAnd breastfeeding is something EVERY Child has experienced for themselves or did you cover up the eyes of your son so he didn\u2019t have to see the breasts of his mom? Siblings see their sister and brothers being fed\u2026\n\nWhat exactly are you fearing might be negative consequences of Kids seeing a loving mother feeding her Baby? I don\u2019t get your concerns\u2026", "Do you think kids don\u2019t remember when they themselves were being breastfed? Lol", "I think you\u2019re the one who doesn\u2019t understand \u201cnudity\u201d", "There is a big difference between nudity and breast feeding.  Chances are most kids at the party have seen their own mom\u2019s nursing and won\u2019t even bat an eye lid.", "Many kids start out their lives sucking on tits. They don\u2019t give a shit until you teach them to.", "Billions of children all over the world see breastfeeding every single day. It's literally by its very function, NOT an adult activity.  \n\nYou are the asshole. I sincerely hope you can be educated by the responses you're getting and adjust your mindset.  It's not what children need to be around,  unlike breastfeeding.", "Almost all kids don\u2019t care about being naked until their parents start making an issue out of it. Almost all little kids I\u2019ve known, especially little boys (mind you I have 3 much younger siblings and was a nanny for many years and help with all my nibblings) will come home and strip down to their underwear. My younger siblings did this for many years, until they were at least 10. At that point they start to realize that their bodies are changing and get embarrassed to do this anymore. Hell I remember being about 5 years old and running around in our underwear in a kiddie pool with my cousins at a family parties because it was so hot and us kids wanted to play in the water (it was the late 80s early 90s). All of us turned out pretty good and my siblings have pretty good relationships with there bodies because we never made them ashamed of them. So yes you are sexualizing not only your sister but kids also, it\u2019s not hard for kids to understand that she\u2019s feeding her baby and telling them in kid friendly ways about why. But instead you are telling her and the kids that she should be ashamed because she\u2019s feeding her baby. Also if her baby has never had formula or is only feed from the breast to the point he\u2019s never had a bottle is a major recipe for disaster (baby could possibly go hungry if he\u2019s never had a bottle), formula has the potential to cause the baby issues, especially if she\u2019s never supplemented with formula. My 3 younger siblings and my nibblings all had to have special formula because of certain ingredients, my oldest nephews formula was a prescription brand specifically mad for the major reflux that he was born with. So you could potentially be putting this baby in harm\u2019s way with this attitude about breast feeding.", "What?! Kids are less weird about nudity than adults first of all, to them it\u2019s not weird or sexual. Not at that age. \n\nSecond and most important\u2026 there is no nudity. She\u2019s feeding her baby not stripping.", "Unless your sister is whipping out the girls with wild abandon and refusing to cover up, there's no nudity is there?", "Kids don\u2019t understand why we care about nudity. Most kids would run around naked all the time. You care. They don\u2019t.", "Can you explain that? Because it sounds like complete bullshit", "Stop, just Stop.\n\nYou are digging yourself deeper and deeper into the fecal matter.\n\n>I don\u2019t sexualize it.\n\nYes you do, by the next statement:\n\n>kids aren\u2019t going to understand nudity like adults do.\n\nKids dgaf about some baby being breastfed, \"like adults do\", right there is where you have sexualized a perfectly natural act as a pornographic act. This is especially ick since it is your sister.\n\nIf I were your Ex, I'd disinvite you to the Bday celebration.", "Literally the opposite. Kids don\u2019t see boobs and immediately think of sex. YTA and a creepy one at that.", "Are you talking about he same children who literally sucked off nipples themselves?\nAnd if kids do for some reason ask, explaining the baby is  having milk, just like they did when they were babies, takes almost zero effort. Get over yourself and your weird obsession with policing natural feeding. YTA", "It's not like she's going to whip out her breast and have it hanging out while she's feeding. You already said she uses a blanket and if kids ask questions you can easily explain to a 7 year old whats happening. Women are very good at ensuring nothing 'slips out' and if it's truly such an issue for you you could compromise and ask her to do it somewhere private. Telling her she can't breastfeed her growing child and demanding she use formula is wrong. \n\nAnd yes women can breastfeed wherever they want. It's the other persons problem if they have an issue with it. Were you breastfed? Were your kids breastfed? Get over it.", "Here's a hint: If they don't understand it, EXPLAIN IT TO THEM. \n\nThat is your job as a parent! EXPLAINING HOW THINGS WORK.\n\n\"Hey dad what is Aunt Mia doing?\"\n\n\"She's feeding your cousin. Babies need to be fed and Aunt Mia, like many women, is breastfeeding her son. Some people can't or choose not to breastfeed and rely on formula to feed their baby, but as long as the baby is fed, that is what is best\"\n\n\"So why doesn't she use formula?\"\n\n\"Because Aunt Mia decided to breastfeed. Anyway go play with your other friends\" \n\nSee how easy that is? See how simple?", "The only reason a kid wouldn\u2019t understand nudity is because an adult is sexualizing this.", "Well spotted!", "Bet you're right. Because those breasts were HIS, goddammit!", "Even so he should know that switching between formula isn't good for baby.", "True!\n\nI have breastfed in public many, many times and the only negative comments I ever got were from men and that was only a few times. Kids generally weren\u2019t interested at all, if they even noticed.", "[deleted]", "Fully aware that stupid Europeans exist. This kind of stupidity is very much more common in the US though.", "What you do at home is your own business.\n\nIf you do it on a bench at the mall, I have a problem with it.", "I love you for that last line!", "Bc you\u2019re the ah, one validating comment doesn\u2019t take away from that. You acknowledge children don\u2019t see nudity as adults do, they do not see nudity as wrong *unless the adults act like it is wrong* you\u2019re setting your son up for terrible behavior towards women", "That\u2019s because you are very wrong, just like the person you responded to. YTA", "when everyone in a room is telling you what an asshole you are and you refuse to listen except when one person says you aren't? that doesn't make you not an asshole. it just makes you an obtuse one.", "That's because unfortunately you aren't the only other creepy weirdo in the world. Don't let this one NTA from another weirdo in a sea of YTAs cloud your judgement. You are 100000% an AH as well as disgusting.", "Yup, guess why? It\u2019s because YTA that\u2019s why.", "because 99% of the human race would call you an AH for this", "One NTA is convincing enough for you to make you think you're actually NTA! Get a grip! \n\nYou've sexualised something that is completely natural and btw half of those kids have probably been breast fed so probably won't see anything odd to them.\n\nGrow TF up, you and your brother are absolutely TA here.", "That would be because you are TA. The person who said NTA would be incorrect in most places in the world and is definitely wrong for the US. Women can definitely breastfeed anywhere, anytime. I do believe that got passed into federal law. Now, that doesn't truly affect you as a private home owner/renter, it does indicate that you are indeed the asshole here.", "You\u2019re only responding to the one comment that agrees with you out of hundreds that don\u2019t. Yes YTA. Accept the judgement. Stop being a jerk. You could have made this a non issue and set her up a calm, pretty, quiet space to nurse but instead you were a jerk about it.", "Most people don't like being wrong.", "It seems you haven't learned anything from these comments dude. YTA. Breastfeeding is natural.", "Buddy, looking for the answer you want and finding one other person who has the same fucked up thinking as you isn\u2019t the way to get to the right answer.  Look at the answers in this thread.  Your view on breastfeeding is wrong and it\u2019s disordered thinking. You need to get therapy to figure out why you\u2019ve attached these views to breastfeeding and nudity.  The person you responded to is just as faked up as you are.  This isn\u2019t the handmaid\u2019s tale.", "Yeah, that's what happens when you're a complete AH", "Awww using confirmation bias to stay comfy in your worldview? so adorable.", "It's sexualising his sister but also grossly misunderstanding breastfeeding. My second child refused any kind of bottle and he had a really sensitive stomach, so giving him formula would have been absolutely impossible. If an infant is used to breast milk you can't just go and give them formula, it doesn't work that way. And in the early stages of breastfeeding it can even mess up your supply if you replace feeds with formula. Bad idea all around. \n\nI've breastfed my babies in so many different places and I've never had a child react badly to it in any way. Most don't react at all, because really there's not much to see. Some ask a few questions because they're curious. When you explain that's how a baby eats they continue on with whatever they're doing. To kids there's nothing sexual about it, why is OP making this weird?", "Wish I had an award to give you.  This should be the top comment.", "My kid tries to sit on my lap while I poop. She doesn\u2019t give af about nudity", "I've literally never had a kid giggle about me breastfeeding. The 14 year old was awkward. The 4 and 8 year olds couldn't care less. The 2 year old was really intrigued and wanted to know what the baby was doing. None of them were upset.", "I get a feeling that OP might be the one needing that serious conversation.", "Yes, but that would mean putting in the effort. OP wants to send her out of the room because he's too damn lazy.", "Right... there's cake at a party. That's all those kids are gonna care about.", "I openly breastfeed my one year old nearly everywhere I go. I have never had a single person say boo to me. The OP is being a weirdo with this.\n\nYTA", "Like\u2026 what\u2019s to understand? That people are naked under their clothes? Most kids can grasp that. \n\nIf the \u201cunderstanding\u201d that the kids don\u2019t have is understanding why a bare female nipple is a huge deal and a bare male nipple isn\u2019t, then I\u2019m right there with them.", "Even in the US most kids aren't bothered by nudity, it's when they get to toddler or tween age that adults teach them this stuff sadly. Glad I broke out if that mindset in college. Hell I would sleep with a bra on back in the days just in case", ">breasts bouncing up and down people\u2019s faces?\n\nThe visual this gave me made me legit lol.", "Something I realized when I started breastfeeding is why people are attracted to breasts in the first place. It's not because they are sexual, it's because they are representative of comfort, care and closeness. \n\nBoobies mean love!\n\nOur definition of love just evolves as we grow up.", "I mean, probably not because most people stop before the age when kids make long term memories. But kids absolutely understand that breastfeeding is a mum feeding a baby and it's normal..", "Welp, should have let my son starve to death since I have flat nipples, he couldn\u2019t latch, & even the hospital\u2019s industrial pump couldn\u2019t milk me rather than give him formula.", "I have a problem w people wearing socks with sandals in public. Still doesn't mean they should be banned from the public. Unless we're in clockwork orange, no one is forcing you to watch them breastfeed", "Oh, come on. I know I forgot the /s but even so... \n\nWoman don't expose themselfs when breastfeeding. We feed the way that works best for our baby's. All are different. My son never wanted to drink beneath a cloth. He pulled it away and then let go of the breast. Showing even more then when I feed without a cloth. My daughter doesn't mind a cloth. \n\nWoman don't show more then necessary because they want to expose themselfs. They feed there baby and are focused on that.\n\nEdit to add: you've got a neck. Use it to turn your head. Then you don't need to have a problem with feeding mothers.", "It just means there are two assholes in the room instead of one.", "Why would anyone go to the inconvenience of pumping, storing, reheating, trying to get a baby to take a bottle when they've got the perfect delivery method right there on their body that works. Why is a grown man who knows nothing about breastfeeding telling her how to care for her kid anyway. People are so stupid", "Why even bring up formula at all if she's breastfeeding? Pumping is a thing, and some babies can feed both ways without much problem.\n\nStill think op is the AH for sexualizing it though, and for the formula suggestion too.", "You have one of those too? I\u2019m thinking of starting a club", "I mean 95% of the time 14 year olds are awkward so it really isn't that much of a change in who they are", "You\u2019d be surprised at what people can remember as babies. And even if they may not have specific memories of it, when I mention to a kid that breastfeeding is what they did when they were a baby, they\u2019re usually just like \u201cOh yeah.\u201d", "Underrated comment!", "Why wasn't her going into another room like the bedroom for privacy an option for OP?
