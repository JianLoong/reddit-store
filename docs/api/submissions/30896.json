I divorced him when my oldest was 14 and youngest was 10. Well he ended up spiraling and the kids were exposed to that. I was blamed for ruining dad. He got better after a few years but ending up doing it again when he learned I was dating. So the kids kept trying to get me not to date since it will affect their dad. It was an awful time since to the kids I was still responsible for what he did and reacted to things.\n\nIn the end I just kept my dating on the low end which wasn\u2019t hard since it wasn\u2019t introducing the kids to the men anyways. All I had to change was not posting on social media. Also yes I sent the kids to therapy. They all stopped when they hit 18 or my middle child refused to talk so I pulled him.\n\nThe oldest is now 25 and youngest is 21 and I got proposed too. I sat them down and told them, they were not happy and were pissed I was doing this to dad. Lots of talked later and I thought it was good. The wedding is in two weeks\n\nI got a text from all the kids saying they will not be at my wedding, that they need to support dad during this time. I had enough and texted them that if they do not go to my wedding it will damage our relationship and I will not be attending there own weddings when they get married.\n\nThey were pissed and it started an argument and all of them think I am huge jerk. I truly hate that I can\u2019t do anything that makes me happy since it will affect my ex.\n\nSorry for errors on phone and not native speaker.\n\nUpdate: I realized I am okay letting them go, I can\u2019t do it anymore. I sent a texts it is up to them if they go or not. If they do go I have hope to fix this relationship if not I\u2019m just done. I can\u2019t keep playing this game. It\u2019s for everything, anytime I have something good his feelings have to come first.\n\nI can\u2019t do that anymore it hurts to much. I could tell them everything he has done but I don\u2019t feel like blowing up their image of him. \n\nUpdate2: someone private messaging me convinced me to lay it all out for them, so I did. Well I got my response, they called me a liar. Even with showing old screenshot that were in our divorce case\n\nI think it is over. Thanks for everyone that tried to help. I known this was a no win situation\n\nI did fuck it and sent every single thing including this post.

Unfortunately, there's nothing more you can do now. Just give the kids time to wise up and see their father for who he is. \n\nDon't give them ultimatums.

Presumably he'd have made his own positions clear.\n\nAnother thing I keep coming back to is this: if he was such a shit person, would he really be going into such severe recurring spirals?

The only way to mitigate would be to leave the room entirely. (That, of course, was twisted into *me* wronging *her*, which then formed the basis for more nastiness)\n\nWhich is all a long way of saying that when OP comments that her ex would \"duck out\" when watching kids as an example of a reason she divorced him , ***he might have had the very best of reasons in the world.***\n\nNow maybe this isn't that.

They are very involved here.\n\nPlus, lets slow down here. Was dad ruined financially due to paying excessive child support and having to pay for both lawyers? Did he have to go from living in a nice suburban house to living in an apartment in a bad neighborhood? It seems like she was flaunting her dating escapades on social media without being serious enough to bring them home until the pushback was too big. How many guys? How much does she trash talk dad? Why were they sent to therapy? Was it because she cared or because she was sick of them complaining? All this might sound over the top, and it likely is, but these are also the questions kids as young as ten would be asking. You can't just upend a kid's life and say \"shut up the adults are talking.\" They *will* find answers one way or another. \n\nAlso, one throw away line from a bitter divorcee and everyone is just clapping like seals over how bad the husband is and how she's fantastic?

Home alone? Dropped off at dad's? It would be one thing if she was dating to expand the family and moved in with the dude later. But she was spending time with faceless strangers who won't be around long term over her own family. And if they *are* around long term that's even worse, considering the decision was to essentially have a second life that they aren't invited to.\n\n Her first reaction to them saying no is essentially \"If you don't come to my wedding, I will stop loving you\". That is *hugely abusive*. Especially considering this new husband is completely unknown to them, outside of being invited to a couple lunches or something.\n\nI agree with you that there should be no contact, but not because the kids are being selfish. Its because this mom seems abusive and manipulative and honestly I get no indication here that she actually cares about them.\n\nSince she also sent this reddit thread to them (most likely as a shaming tactic): Kids if you end up reading this: Make your own decisions.

What concerns me about the kids' reaction is that they still haven't come around yet, and they're in their 20s.\n\nWhen my parents got divorced, my dad didn't handle it well. My mom initiated it because she was tired of him being irate and drunk all the time. It's been 30+ years since the divorce, and Dad STILL blames Mom for everything (EVERYTHING) that has gone wrong in his life. Not his alcoholism, not his negligent dad. Just Mom.\n\nMy brother and I would go and visit him some weekends. He'd rent us video games and buy us toys. At least he did until Mom's savings (which he got half of in the divorce) ran out. Then he'd have us over, plop us in the other room with a TV, and sat around while he drank and watched daytime TV. It was INCREDIBLY boring until we'd eat dinner. Then we'd sit together, watch the news (also boring), and listen to him tell us how much of a money-hungry, spiteful, awful woman our mom is. He'd never shut up about it.\n\nWell, my brother and I would listen to him say these things, and then we'd go home and realize he was full of shit. She cared about money because they had a mortgage to pay and he wasn't helping. She could barely afford to buy us new clothes. He didn't pay child support because he didn't have a job. His reason for not having a job was that he was too good and too smart to work in retail or at the post office or just anywhere.\n\nSo my brother and I eventually cut contact. My brother when he graduated high school, and my dad's ever-so-generous graduation present to him was Dad's beat up old Mercedes that didn't work. In the end, it wasn't worth the cost of towing it to the junkyard. But me... I tried to be sympathetic because Dad had literally nobody else in his life. He had burned all his bridges. But one day, he called me drunk (as usual) and yelled at me about something, I forget what. That was it.

Also, they\u2019re adults but they\u2019re still young ones.  Your claim that them missing your wedding is proof they\u2019ll never be happy for you is a little extreme.  You can\u2019t force them to feel how you want them to feel but you will ruin your relationship with them by trying.  Just a thought.", "What do you expect them to think if you've never explained the truth to them?\n\nI don't think you're an AH, but if your kids don't know the truth, you can't expect them to act in the way you feel they should.", "It's been 10 years, is she never supposed to be with anyone ever again because her adult kids don't want her to?", "Kids are often alienated by dad, but her decision to avoid answering what caused the divorce (even when answering other questions in the same post) makes me deeply skeptical of OP.", "\"Mom if you ever get married and move past your old abusive husband it's really gonna bother us, your adult children. Pls just be miserable forever, we can't support you moving forward with your life and love on your wedding day. BTW, we need to support our loser dad who's living a decade in the past and is throwing a yet another tantrum over your love life, which has had nothing to do with him for years so there is just no way we would be able to come \"\n\nDid i miss anything? I mean I know you're likely a disingenuous troll but still I feel i should ask. \n\nIt's beyond pathetic for this father to try and manipulate his kids years after their divorce into hating their mom. Like tf.", "Throwing a fit in front of the kids so they pity him & take his \"side.\" I just think that's childish behavior especially since it's been over a decade since divorce", "Ah yes the early teenagers have wronged her. Has nothing to do with parenting, no, it's those evil little shits, all three of them. The parent is not responsible! \n\nPeople focus on this one wedding event but really **this problem started over a decade ago**, the wedding incident is just one tiny symptom of it and it sickens me that people encourage her destructive behavior. That's not to say she's the bad guy, but there's no way this evolved out of nothing. As a parent, she messed up too somewhere. Divorce was likely rough on everyone in the family. \n\nWe can't judge this situation without knowing how she treated her children when all of this started. The fact that she omitted all of this info tells me she likely never truly reflected on it herself (I'm giving her the benefit of the doubt that it's not intentional omission). Instead she may be unintentionally pulling the \"I didn't know any better, I'm blameless!\" card parents sometimes pull when they don't want to face how they messed up raising their kids. OP puts all the blame for a decade old issue on outside factors only. I've read some of OP's posts and it doesn't seem like she's done any self reflection, ever. Everything she says is also devoid of love for her children. She only pities herself. According to her edit it seems like she ended up essentially responding with \"do whatever you want, I'm done with this\" about the wedding rather than engaging in constructive dialogue. \n\nFinally, we know English isn't her mother tongue. We don't know where she's from and culture can make a huge difference. If she's from India, for example, getting all these western oriented responses doesn't help.\n\nIf she wants to stay in contact with her children she will have to change *something* in her behavior and get help for potential untreated trauma on her own side, because at this rate they might dislike her more and more until she loses them entirely. And that will hurt her until the day she dies.\n\nI'm speaking as a person with a mother who exhibited exactly this behavior. She's now in her 50s and still can't face accountability for anything she's done. All the bad interactions were my fault (starting from age 10). She still doesn't recognize that destroying all of my birthday presents because I was \"annoying\" her by playing with my fancy glowing yo-yo was emotional abuse. \nEventually in my late 20s I had to break contact with her permanently for my own wellbeing, as she was still engaging in destructive behavior and I was the adult in pretty much all discussions from age 16+. To this day she still only pities herself and will occasionally send me a letter telling me how miserable I make her feel by cutting off contact. She never went to therapy and the rest of the family thinks I'm an asshole, because \"she's your mother!\" and nobody saw her treatment of me in person, she would put on a mask if anyone else was around all the way until my late 20s. \n\nMy point is: **You can't blame the young kids as a parent. If you do, you've already failed.** Yes, they are adults now, but the problem started when they were young. The oldest was only 14. I'm assuming she didn't birth three Jeffrey Dahmers, so she probably messed up plenty of times to end up here. That's okay. What's not okay is thinking no blame lies with her and it's all their fault and her ex's fault. She sent her kids to therapy but really, she should have joined them. \n\n99% of people don't even comprehend family estrangement, as is clearly visible in this thread.", "This definitely smells like \"I behaved terribly, but I was justified because...\" \nOr alternatively, the father here could teach a master's level course on manipulation to the point all three of their kids still took his side after being presented with all available evidence that the OP is a saint.", "I don\u2019t disagree, however there are better ways to address the issue and she should have addressed it sooner instead of being passive all these years.\n\nI feel bad for her, but more communication with her kids sooner and tackling it when they were younger could have prevented this much damage.\n\nI still stand by the fact the real AH is the Ex husband. But giving ultimatums is an AH response regardless of how right you are in the situation at hand.\n\nAlmost always the one who gives the ultimatum will get the opposite of what they want. It\u2019s counter productive basically.", "This was my first thought...this is his way of controlling OP and making her miserable even after they split.", "Doesn't sound like he's making his kids his therapist, it sounds like he's weaponizing his kids against his ex.", "And it's been happening for 11 years! I sure hope the kids don't think this is normal.", "Yep, he\u2019s been manipulating them and depriving them of two loving parents because at best he emotionally cannot handle what he is going through and has put no work into being better, and at worst he is purposefully trying to deprive his ex of happiness by using his own children and unhappiness and a bargaining chip.", "It's been 10 years and he's still trying to manipulate his ex-wife's dating.

It literally doesn\u2019t impact him at all if she remarried. If he was abused, it is on HIM to get therapy and move on. Not to use his children as pawns in revenge bullshit.", "If she was emotionally abusive to husband, then the whole \"she should not have a new partner years after divorce because dads feelings\" thing would not happened.\n\nIt would happened with reversed roles.", "there's no way she's emotionally manipulative and kept his infidelities secret al;l this time. Of course we don't know that she's perfect, but a problematic person who wanted the kids on their side would've whipped out the screenshots way earlier or subtly allowed them to find out. The dad is obviously the emotionally manipulative one here.", "Why wouldnt you tell everyone the truth the minute he threw you under the bus??  It's only going to get worse the longer you wait.", "Something similar happened to a friend of mine, roles reversed. The mom was the awful one, fed all the lies and poison about how terrible they were. The three kids stopped talking to their father, believing it all. He basically gave up hope.  \u2026 and then she backstabbed one of the kids, and made the kid the new target of her terribleness. The dam broke, the truth eventually came out, and he has his (adult) kids back and he\u2019s so happy to be able to go see his grandkids. Therapy definitely needs to happen here, but it only works if the kids are willing to be honest with themselves and to listen.", "I think the big problem with that is daddy dearest has been programming them since at least the divorce, if not before.", "> but the oldest is 25\n\nYeah can you imagine being 25 and still thinking your dad--whining about being left by your mom and threatening depression at every turn--is somehow the hero here?\n\nLike, please get some critical thinking skills because you're being manipulated to hell at this point.", "OP would have mentioned it for sure.

It's possible it's due to their father being an otherworldly manipulator, but it's also possible that much of the story she's telling is a misrepresentation where she's the victim of 4 separate people whose only mistake is trying to protect her children of the \"truth\" about their father.\n\nMy experience with my mom has taught me that some people will spin narratives like the OP's in order to convince themselves and the people around them that they have no culpability in how much they've alienated their own family.

The fact dad never revealed why they got a divorce either & is just cool with his ex wife being the villan is also very narcissistic so you have to wonder how much of the \"spiraling\" is just dramatics he pulled for attention.\n\nI'm inferring this based on the limited context, at the very least, OP's Ex may not be a (intentional) manipulator, but they are very immature.", "Was it the 10 year old that wronged her, the 14 year old or the middle child?

You're a bad parent. Sadly she is avoiding all responsibility. \n\nShe sent her kids to therapy, she should have gone into therapy with them immediately after a traumatic divorce. That damage is done but OP is still not taking any steps to fix the situation and keeps resorting to 100% victimhood even 10 years later.

That doesn't mean everything is her fault or that her ex is good at all, but she 100% messed up somewhere along the line and has never taken steps to fix the bond with her children, **not even now.**\n\n She should know better.
