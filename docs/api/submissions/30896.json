I divorced him when my oldest was 14 and youngest was 10. Well he ended up spiraling and the kids were exposed to that. I was blamed for ruining dad. He got better after a few years but ending up doing it again when he learned I was dating. So the kids kept trying to get me not to date since it will affect their dad. It was an awful time since to the kids I was still responsible for what he did and reacted to things.\n\nIn the end I just kept my dating on the low end which wasn\u2019t hard since it wasn\u2019t introducing the kids to the men anyways. All I had to change was not posting on social media. Also yes I sent the kids to therapy. They all stopped when they hit 18 or my middle child refused to talk so I pulled him.\n\nThe oldest is now 25 and youngest is 21 and I got proposed too. I sat them down and told them, they were not happy and were pissed I was doing this to dad. Lots of talked later and I thought it was good. The wedding is in two weeks\n\nI got a text from all the kids saying they will not be at my wedding, that they need to support dad during this time. I had enough and texted them that if they do not go to my wedding it will damage our relationship and I will not be attending there own weddings when they get married.\n\nThey were pissed and it started an argument and all of them think I am huge jerk. I truly hate that I can\u2019t do anything that makes me happy since it will affect my ex.\n\nSorry for errors on phone and not native speaker.\n\nUpdate: I realized I am okay letting them go, I can\u2019t do it anymore. I sent a texts it is up to them if they go or not. If they do go I have hope to fix this relationship if not I\u2019m just done. I can\u2019t keep playing this game. It\u2019s for everything, anytime I have something good his feelings have to come first.\n\nI can\u2019t do that anymore it hurts to much. I could tell them everything he has done but I don\u2019t feel like blowing up their image of him. \n\nUpdate2: someone private messaging me convinced me to lay it all out for them, so I did. Well I got my response, they called me a liar. Even with showing old screenshot that were in our divorce case\n\nI think it is over. Thanks for everyone that tried to help. I known this was a no win situation\n\nI did fuck it and sent every single thing including this post.

Unfortunately, there's nothing more you can do now. Just give the kids to wise up and see their father for who he is. \n\nDon't give them ultimatums. Just issue future invites and leave it at that.

They had their entire life/status quo smashed, had to transition to split households, and experienced a huge shift in both of their parent's lifestyles. They are very involved here.\n\nPlus, lets slow down here. Was dad ruined financially due to paying excessive child support and having to pay for both lawyers? Did he have to go from living in a nice suburban house to living in an apartment in a bad neighborhood? It seems like she was flaunting her dating escapades on social media without being serious enough to bring them home until the pushback was too big. How many guys? How much does she trash talk dad? Why were they sent to therapy? Was it because she cared or because she was sick of them complaining? All this might sound over the top, and it likely is, but these are also the questions kids as young as ten would be asking. You can't just upend a kid's life and say \"shut up the adults are talking.\" They *will* find answers one way or another. \n\nAlso, one throw away line from a bitter divorcee and everyone is just clapping like seals over how bad the husband is and how she's fantastic? Seriously? Question: Whats the middle child's age. Looks to me like the only reference they got was how bad they were in therapy.

Home alone? Dropped off at dad's? It would be one thing if she was dating to expand the family and moved in with the dude later. But she was spending time with faceless strangers who won't be around long term over her own family. And if they *are* around long term that's even worse, considering the decision was to essentially have a second life that they aren't invited to.\n\n Her first reaction to them saying no is essentially \"If you don't come to my wedding, I will stop loving you\". That is *hugely abusive*. Especially considering this new husband is completely unknown to them, outside of being invited to a couple lunches or something.\n\nI agree with you that there should be no contact, but not because the kids are being selfish. Its because this mom seems abusive and manipulative and honestly I get no indication here that she actually cares about them.\n\nSince she also sent this reddit thread to them (most likely as a shaming tactic): Kids if you end up reading this: Make your own decisions.

I\u2019ve heard on multiple occasions that it is helpful so hopefully others who need it may stumble upon it here", "Thank you so much for this, it came as the ptsd started to rear it's head and I'm very grateful", "I'm stressed that you posted a pdf of a link I already had downloaded....I think that's a red flag for me.", "Thank you", "Thank you", "Well done including the free pdf! It saves lives.", "This book is amazing and every woman should read it", "Thanks for posting it. What puzzles me is the author\u2019s position that only men, or an abusive lesbian in a female couple are abusive. Women are also abusive in some cases.", "So? They're still her kids. Moving on is one thing, wishing harm on them is beyond me.", "We know nothing about how OP treated her kids and ex.\n\nActually, we do: her parenting style is apparently to issue threats if she doesn't get what she wants. Ultra red flag right there especially because she makes no mention of how SHE behaved towards her children and hervpost is entirely devoid of empathy, even when referring to her children as teenagers. She \"sent them to therapy\". What about parenting? \n\nMy diagnosed narcissistic mother could have written this OP. It's all about her, and written in such a way, leaving out 90% context, that it's impossible to disagree with her. And thousands of people here are falling for it, making her feel better. Which was the goal all along. \n\nThe only context we do have points towards OP being a bad parent.", "I hope that if your kids are being stupid that you still want what's best for them and not just petty revenge.", "He might not even treat them that well. He could be like a cult leader. Manipulate and narcissistic, but not really nice to anyone. A lot of people who are AH are still good at persuading others to do their will", "I seriously hate the double standards, when people do the right thing that Reddit always preaches then it\u2019s magically a problem since redditors  don\u2019t like the tone or the story \n\nThey just want to twist it into being a villain,", "This is a wise idea.", "No real surprise. Dad did a great number \ud83e\udd2c", "[deleted]", "This stinks of missing reasons.", "Yes the first sentence is that he\u2019s a terrible husband but that\u2019s the most vague shit I seen. Any explanation would be nice for context instead of just a terrible husband. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Yeah, the kids are old enough to \u201cknow better\u201d but they\u2019ve spent a long time also being responsible for their father\u2019s feelings and emotions. That\u2019s a vicious cycle to break and I\u2019m sure the kids feel the burden of making sure he doesn\u2019t go off the deep end again", "He isn't spiralling, he's having a tantrum because he isn't in control. He lost control during the divorce and her finding someone new meant she was moving on. He's using the children to maintain control of her life and they can't see it because he's successfully rebranded his tantrums to \"sad and depressed\".\n\nEven if he weren't being manipulative and controlling, you're right that it's nothing to do with her. This is literally around a decade ago and he's still sulking. I can see why she divorced him.", "Ah yes. The \u201cyou made me do it\u201d argument. That\u2019s just a way to avoid responsibility for your actions/behavior. Also let\u2019s not blame the kids while they were still young kids, Jesus.", "NTA\n\nYour kids are adults now. I'm worried they don't understand how your continously being controlled and abused by your ex through them.\n\nBefore issuing ultimatums, have one last face to face discussion with a mediator present.\n\nIf they still don't understand, then it probably is time you give them a break until they come to the realisation themselves.", "Again, that's just assumption. The kids are grown ass adult, you don't know if the dad is badmouthing the mom. Maybe he is just doing his own things even if he is still in love with his ex and the kids decided on their own that mom is the bad guy. Or maybe the mom was the bad guy, she just didn't want to mention her wrong in the post.\n\nWe just don't know.", "NTA. What concerns me about the kids' reaction is that they still haven't come around yet, and they're in their 20s.\n\nWhen my parents got divorced, my dad didn't handle it well. My mom initiated it because she was tired of him being irate and drunk all the time. It's been 30+ years since the divorce, and Dad STILL blames Mom for everything (EVERYTHING) that has gone wrong in his life. Not his alcoholism, not his negligent dad. Just Mom.\n\nMy brother and I would go and visit him some weekends. He'd rent us video games and buy us toys. At least he did until Mom's savings (which he got half of in the divorce) ran out. Then he'd have us over, plop us in the other room with a TV, and sat around while he drank and watched daytime TV. It was INCREDIBLY boring until we'd eat dinner. Then we'd sit together, watch the news (also boring), and listen to him tell us how much of a money-hungry, spiteful, awful woman our mom is. He'd never shut up about it.\n\nWell, my brother and I would listen to him say these things, and then we'd go home and realize he was full of shit. She cared about money because they had a mortgage to pay and he wasn't helping. She could barely afford to buy us new clothes. He didn't pay child support because he didn't have a job. His reason for not having a job was that he was too good and too smart to work in retail or at the post office or just anywhere.\n\nSo my brother and I eventually cut contact. My brother when he graduated high school, and my dad's ever-so-generous graduation present to him was Dad's beat up old Mercedes that didn't work. In the end, it wasn't worth the cost of towing it to the junkyard. But me... I tried to be sympathetic because Dad had literally nobody else in his life. He had burned all his bridges. But one day, he called me drunk (as usual) and yelled at me about something, I forget what. That was it. I hung up on him and blocked his number.\n\nAnyway, my brother and I saw through his shit from a young age. OP's kids haven't, and they're adults. I hope I'm wrong, but I think it's hopeless.", "Doesn\u2019t sounds like that good of a father for alienating his children from their mother.", "Which means that he isn't a good father, either.", "yeah when my aunt got divorced my cousins were sad for a bit but very quickly got over it. not because my uncle wasn\u2019t a good dad (he was! and he was a pretty good uncle too. came to some of my events when i was a kid if he had the time) but because he was an awful husband, and they could see how much better their mom was for it. plus the youngest still had to go to his house for custody and would come back with stories about how much she didn\u2019t really enjoy being around her dad when he was with someone who wasn\u2019t her mom.", "This!\n\nOP divorced him and has STILL been emotionally manipulated by him THROUGH her kids for 10 years.\n\nThat's some sick stuff.\n\nDad has chosen to DO this to his kids too.\n\nThey are relatively young, haven't had life experience yet & they've been raised by this parent model dad is using.\n\nIt's long drawn out trauma bonding. Gah! Again, so sick.\n\nIt's so devastating to have to choose to disconnect from your kids. Everyone assumes there is something wrong w YOU vs seeing you HAD to make a choice and you chose not to be sick & miserable for people who can't/won't do their own work.\n\nOP is def NTA and I cheer her and support her hard won choice.", "I really appreciate this author because (iirc) he purposefully allows this book to be available for free because he knows how vital the info is, and really wants to help people.\n\nI'm glad it found its way to you.", "Hey Peachy Beachy,\n\nI'm happy that this book clicked with you.

So you don't need to worry about my imaginary kids being subjected to my petty revenge.", "Even if he didn\u2019t, 11 years is a long time. Plenty of people wouldn\u2019t believe the truth after that long.", "This does not seem to have anything to do with specifically who she\u2019s with. It\u2019s very clear by this post they wouldn\u2019t approve of anyone she\u2019s with because it would \u201churt dad\u201d for her to move on at all. Which is bonkers.", "I understand the instinct to jump to missing reasons in estrangement situations, but I think this is ignoring how powerful and insidious parental alienation can be. It is difficult to counteract and basically impossible to address in court. There is honestly not a whole lot you can do aside from hoping that the kids see the truth for themselves.\n\nThis is also categorically not [missing missing reasons](https://www.issendai.com/psychology/estrangement/missing-missing-reasons.html), because OP is not claiming that she doesn\u2019t know why the kids hate her. They are telling her why, and she hears them. Dad does not want her to date or remarry, and they are taking his side on the issue.", "You have more context later. He's still trying to control OP through manipulating their kids. He's trying to stop OP from dating, or just to make her life miserable. If that sounds like a good husband to you, I have nothing else to say.", "You're probably right, but on the off chance he isn't throwing a tantrum she needs to establish firmer boundaries and establish an info diet for whoever js sharing her dating life. Her kids also need to realise that after the divorce the only tie she had to him was their kids and they can't keep using her to appease him", "Likely their dad has weaponised them so much and for so long that they\u2019re just used to being weapons for coercive control and they don\u2019t realise it\u2019s wrong because they haven\u2019t been taught and OP seems to be doing way too much to avoid exposing just how awful he is to the kids (which I commend on one hand, but it\u2019s the difficult part when an ex is this controlling, because how do you fight that weaponisation without feeling like you\u2019re doing the same thing?). \n\nThey\u2019re still relatively young for adults and honestly I would hope that most 21-25 year olds WOULD have very limited exposure to how abuse works, so I can see how they might not have snapped out of it yet. At some point they may learn, probably if they go through similar or if a friend goes through similar and they see the whole situation through adult eyes, or they might just go on to repeat this pattern with their own families in future. \n\nIt\u2019s so shitty for OP though and I kind of feel like she\u2019s in her rights to say enough is enough. Her kids are grown and she deserves to be happy in the rest of her life. She is not the custodian for her exes mental health.", "I know that your ex\u2019s feelings should have zero impact on whether your adult children attend your next wedding 11 years after divorce", "I went through a situation last year where I was used for sex and tried going to r/MomForAMinute for support, but got mod blocked because I was told it wasn\u2019t appropriate and to leave it all for my therapist (which I was lucky enough to, and still do, have).", "Yes! Please come to this sub! We love new ducklings!", "Where do you get this info?

She's literally manipulating everyone here into making her feel better.\n\nDo you seriously believe three adults in their 20s refuse to come to her wedding because \"it hurts daddy\"? No no, she fucked up parenting her children a loooong time ago, I guarantee you that. \n\nI happily invite OP to give more context because her current post lacks the information to judge anything other than her parenting style, which doesn't look good.", ">  The father quite literally abused and neglected them yet they still prefer him?
