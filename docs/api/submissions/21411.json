Please ask for clarification if something's unclear, this is not my standard vocabulary.\n\nMy parents decided to cut my brother's portion of inheritance down to the compulsory portion. He'll only get what he's legally entitled to, nothing more. Also he won't get a say in the whole process (whereas my step sister and I get to distribute heirlooms and money that is specified in the testament towards the grandchildren, if certain conditions are met). \n\nThe reason for this is that my brother is a very unreflected, selfish and weak person who is also a very shitty father to his 2 daughters. He divorced their mom (who we refer to as \"the dragon\" within the family and that not without reason) and basically abandoned his daughters. The girls have to be with their mom and that in itself is horrible (unfortunately the youth welfare office can't help since a certain amount of cruelty towards your children seens to be legal). \n\nMy parents are locking my brother out of the inheritance to protect their assets - they want THE GIRLS to have their share but they fear (rightfully so) that the dragon will take it from them. As far as I know there is nothing comparable to a trust fund where I live, so as long as the girls are dependent on their mother, she will get the chance to steal the money. My parents want my step sister and I to give the money to the girls when they have gained independence from the dragon. They are supposed to use the money for whatever THEY want. No other conditions need to be met. \n\nNow my brother got wind of this and contacted me for the first time in 3 years. He wants me to influence my parents to change their will back to how it was. \n\nI said no and now he and his ex are blowing up my phone and threatening that me or my parents will never ever see the girls again and what not. \n\nThe girls need their grandparents. They are the only adults who support them and love them unconditionally. I do not get to see the girls that often, because the dragon hates me, too (for other reasons). I used to fight this but when my niece's have a nice time with me and my family the dragon will punish them. I can't let that happen so I pulled back. \n\nAITA if I don't let myself be blackmailed?", "created_utc": 1688554334, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14r79e4/aita_for_not_siding_with_my_brother_over_his/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Can you stall for time?

As a matter of fact, you and your sister may die before or in the same accident as your parents if you are really unlucky, and in that case everything will go to your brother no matter what.", "NTA You call the dragon that for a reason.

I showed her the messages I got but she doubts that it would be enough. \n\nI fear that any action in this direction would escalate the conflict even more. I am really torn. The harassment doesn't really bother me, I'm used to their hurtful words, I wasn't NC with my brother without reason. But their threats towards their own children are getting to me.

My parents wanted to set them up with something for their future and saved for them. \n\nThe law in my country doesn't allow for a scenario where an adult (18 years old) can't get access to their own assets. Since it's unlikely that the girls will be independent from their mom at 18, my parents rightfully fear the money will be taken away from them \"for their own good\"...\n\nBut you're right. I'll tell my parents to talk to a notary or bank person or someone similar. \n\nIf there is no other option my step sister and I will \"inherit\" the money for the girls, pay the taxes on them (and happily so) and give it to them later.
