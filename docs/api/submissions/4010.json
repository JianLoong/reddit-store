That said, you can't change her.", "When my kid was born, my parents bought and delivered diapers for the first year.  That was amazing.", "NTA. Diapers are expensive af. I'm a firm believer of not over buying baby clothes for this reason. Babies grow out of them too quick and you end up with too many. It was rude to say Christmas Is Not About Saving You Money. They shouldn't have asked then. You requested something that is an immediate need. Just know now that you can't ask them for practical gifts anymore.", "NTA at all. The diapers are also for him lol it's not like you'll be squeezing into them \ud83d\ude43 he also doesn't have a sense of fashion or that kind of self expression yet so buying the baby clothes isn't something for him to enjoy anyway.", "NTA. A good friend complained about the same problem to me once, and her solution was to ask for activities. Season pass to the local pool, or zoo if your son likes animals, might be something you can ask for instead? (And at least they don't take up closet space ;)", "NTA\n\nA hamper of nappies, wipes and maybe a little toy are for him - not just 'to save money'. \n\nIf i asked someone what they wanted to get their kids for Christmas and they said this, I would happily oblige!", "NTA. Why bother asking you if you didn't have a choice in what she bought. \n\nWhat's wrong with people in that age range? So fragile and delicate. If she's anything like my FIL she will buy you something you didn't ask for so you have to appear grateful for it as a weird act of control", "NTA wow. Your 1 year old won't even remember this Christmas. \n\nShe'd rather spend money on what he doesn't need, and inconvenience YOU rather than help you in any way....and I'm guessing she expects you to be grateful too for essentially buying clutter.", "I'd say NTA because SHE ASKED! Why would she want to give him something he doesn't need and might not use? \n\nIf diapers aren't \"fun\" enough for her, then she should think creatively, and maybe get him tickets to some fun places/events, a pass to the local zoo, etc.  She could even go with him, and make memories.", "NTA\n\nAsk for outings or memberships to museum or zoo or swimming lessons\n\nAsking for consumables is perfectly fine imo", "NTA - those diapers and wipes are for him and you. he needs them to stay clean and not make a mess. he's barely old enough to really understand what christmas is. idk why she can't just save her money for spoiling him when it makes sense", "My mom used to buy ridiculous amounts of clothes and toys for my kids when they were small. She was unhappy with how messy their room was all the time. She was unhappy with me saying I was going to start getting rid of all the stuff she gave them. She was salty. She came over and cleaned their room and pulled out SIX HEFTY BAGS OF TOYS AND CLOTHES to donate and allowed that maybe she could ease up on buying them things. \n\nIdk why your issue made me think of this. \n\nI hope I\u2019m never that grandparent.\n\nOh NTA.", "NTA you can always use diapers for sure but what about checking out a mommy & me class in the area and suggest she pay for that or how about a photo package to get pictures taken?", "The argument could also be that she IS saving you money by buying clothes a few sizes up. So why not get something practical like diapers! Or college tuition! She just wants to buy what she wants to. Probably asked so she\u2019d look good. Hopefully she leaves the tags on so you can return.", "NTA, maybe ask for like a zoo membership? Then it doesn\u2019t take up any space but is still \u201cmaterial\u201d?", "NTA- He's one and has no concept of Christmas, birthdays, or gifts in general. She could wrap a box and it would be a hit. So shitty of them to not buy what is needed and appreciated. Super toxic.", "uhhh obviously nta,it's actually rlly nice ur being practical", "ESH. Your mom for being snippy and you for not trying to find a workaround. Let her give him something small to open on Christmas and then suggest that maybe she take him somewhere he'd enjoy as his actual present or possibly make a contribution to a college fund or something. There are plenty of ways around this situation but neither you or your mom seem to care about compromise.", "How are diapers for you but clothes for him?  Most one year olds I know spend most of their time trying to escape both of these things.\n\nI suspect that diapers (which are icky) are for you but clothes (which are cute) are for *grandma*.   NTA.", "MIL could send the diapers in a big cardboard box. That box would be most loved present at Christmas.", "NTA. Gifts might not be for you to save money, but they\u2019re not for him to enjoy either if she buys clothes. I can\u2019t imagine a one-year-old enjoying or even giving a hoot about what they\u2019re wearing. \n\nIt would have been nice of her to just buy diapers and wipes. And maybe a small toy to make it look prettier, but really. At that age, I imagine (correct me if I\u2019m wrong, I do not have children) most gifts are enjoyed primarily by the parents, not the child.", "A great gift idea from grandparents is museum memberships. Grandma feels like she splurged and you don't get more stuff in the house.", "NTA what she thinks your asking so you can wear the diapers or wipe yourself. Not all gifts need to be fun. Heck any toy you get a child will likely be lost before they are old enough to remember it or replaced and just forgotten like it never existed.", "NTA. If she insists on getting something fun, ask for an experience gift (like a membership to a zoo or similar). \n\nShe can get him whatever she wants. You aren\u2019t obligated to use it or keep it. You can\u2019t change her, but you can manage her. You aren\u2019t wrong about this and she is being an AH.", "YTA . She\u2019s right. Get rid of stuff he\u2019s outgrown/ clutter  to make room . She wants to buy a gift not supplies for you. Look up the word gracious .", "Suggestion- ask for an experience in she wants to use her money for a gift but does not want to buy you diapers. Membership to a kids play place, a local zoo, a play something that she could even join. NTA but also it\u2019s her money and she may enjoy being able to buy the kid something fun.", "I\u2019m going NAH.  I absolutely get why she doesn\u2019t want to buy diapers as a Christmas present.  I kinda agree with her that you\u2019re basically just asking for something for you at that point (saving you that money.) Grandparents want to get something more fun! \n\nWhat about books? Or an experience (trip to the zoo?) I\u2019d hope you can come up with some compromise that\u2019s between basically give me money or give me nothing.\n\nAnd you truly have no space to store clothes he\u2019ll grow into? Yeah his closet is full but you can\u2019t cycle the clothes out as he needs them?  Like the next size up is in a box under his crib for now?", "NTA - MIL sounds like. Red flag.

When ours we're so little, diapers were the best present for all occasions, except maybe the birthday. For Christmas tho? A big pack of diapers will do quite nicely. At 1 year old it's a present the baby will actually enjoy and use. Clothes are a questionable present. Even those couple of sizes bigger, cause you never know if they'll have a chance of actually wearing them.", "Nta\n\nUh. Last I checked, diapers were an important need for a baby so it's still for him. I mean, my youngest is 11 now so I guess it could have changed. \n\nI really really don't understand your MIL's perspective here. Wouldn't buying him clothes and toys also be saving you money?", "NTA your MIL is being ridiculous. Your child is one. He doesn\u2019t know where his nose is, let alone what presents he\u2019s getting right now. Now is the time to get practical gifts for him such as diapers and so on. These can be helpful for young couples such as yourselves. \n\nYour mother-in-law is being wasteful, and only thinking of herself. Ask her to give a gift receipt for her present so that you can exchange it for diapers.", "Seriously! I had onesies and toddler outfits that my son never got a chance to wear before he grew out of them, but I never had him grow out of an extra pack of diapers. Diapers and wipes are like gold to most parents, right up there with the kiddos formula of choice (if not breastfed). I had to straight up tell my mom to stop with the clothes and toys because I was running out of space in my dressers and my son's playroom.", "You can ask something with out giving up control/choice to that person.\n\nIf I ask what do you want for Xmas and someone says a rolls Royce that does not mean I am obligated to get it. \n\nPeople ask because they want to have suggestions input. \n\nGift giving a two way street it is not just about the sprain getting the gift but also about the person giving it too. Often often people want to give a good gift that people/kids will enjoy. \n\nThe kid will use the diapers/wipes but they enjoy they in a fun tradition sense. Of course all kids like/enjoy having clean diapers/bum, but not the same way they enjoy a new toy etc...\n\nI'm on OPs side about having to many toys/clothes, but this is where experience gifts come in handy that can create memories for the whole family (minus baby) won't remember. \n\nBut things like baby's first boat ride, train ride, petting zoo, carousal, pony ride, etc.... There are so many \"fun\" experience gifts that baby will enjoy that don't add clutter to the house.", "NTA-\n\nTell your Mother-in-Law that your son wears ____ from a big box store- (wherever you buy your diapers) and ask for a gift receipt. You can say you want the gift receipt just in case the item doesn\u2019t fit. \n\nWhy ask if you don\u2019t have the intention to follow thru. \n\nEnjoy your Christmas!!"]}
