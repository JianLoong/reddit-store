A 1yo can't express his wants, and a toy will make him happy for all of five mins before it's old news. Your MIL's present clearly isn't \"for him\", she just wants to go cute baby clothes shopping. Does she not realize clothes would also save you guys money? That's gonna be the case regardless, she might as well get things you guys (baby most of all) actually need", "Diapers are expensive and \"are for him\". \n\nReminds me of my folks when my son was little.", "How about a savings bond or an investment account OR college savings fund?", "This was how we went after a while. Either expensive upgrades (like a new car seat), experiences, larger one of items (like the backyard playhouse), or soon to be needed items (like a big kid bed and sheets).", "I'm wrapping up mandarins for my kids this year because they are obsessed. They are getting \"real\" gifts too, but little ones love what they love.", "That is the most consumerist bs I read in a while.", "Would you insist on buying other stuff even if they specifically asked for diapers and wipes like in the post??", "> \"are for him\"\n\nthey are not though? They are very solidly in the \"every parent provides this for their kid\" category.

It's not going to remember going to the zoo. I understand your experiences vs. material items argument, which is fair, but if the person getting the gift is only accepting our of obligation, then the person giving the gift is an asshole.", "that's a great idea! thank you for that idea... I'm taking the baby with us too... I'll look into that add on!", "every parent buys their kid clothes also, yet you don't seem to be opposed to Grandma buying him clothing.  How is that not on par with diapers?  Aren't diapers just disposable underwear?  By your metric pretty much ANY practical thing given as a gift to a child ultimately ends up being 'for the parent'.\n\nNTA", "The same can be said of most gifts for babies though.

Grandma has probably seen those sad caged up animals endless times.", "I live in small rural town, we still have one. And a pass to the children's museum an hour away. It was just one example, I'm sure grandma can google options near OP.", "What about a weekend away to see the zoo? Hotel and restaurant gift certificates and zoo admission?"]}
