That\u2019s never okay.\nIt\u2019s your thing to tell people and they betrayed your trust.\n\nYou should speak to them properly.", "You said \"they did that before\" you clearly told them a boundary and they trampled it. If this isn't the first time, and you've had problems with saying what your boundary is and them \"taking it into their hands\" then get rid of these friends. Im sorry but they aren't friends. Friends understand boundaries, they don't blame it on overreacting.", "NTA. Outing you is a huge no, regardless of their reasoning behind it. I suggest you take those friends aside and tell them calmly how it\u2019s hurtful to do what they did and take it as a learning experience. Hopefully they won\u2019t do that to someone else in the future.\n\nIf you worry they\u2019re going to tell everyone in the class they might not be the friends you thought they were. \n\nThis is typical highschool behaviour though, unfortunately.", "NTA.\n\nThey outed you and by doing so, they willingly violated your trust, privacy and boundaries all in one.\n\nThese people aren\u2018t your \"friends\" and deserve some serious clapback.

Maybe they don't understand that breaking someones trust is kind of a big deal. NTA for flipping out over it. As for only telling the two friends but not the third, I can kind of see why someone could be upset about it but a) it's your decision and b) it seems that A understood that telling anyone might be a big thing for you and that you probably would have told A as soon as you felt comfortable about it.", "NTA, they have no right to tell anyone about something you told them in confidence without your approval", "NTA \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA\n\nBut lesson learned, privacy is a very hard thing to keep, do not tell folks stuff you do not want repeated.", "Nta.\n\nComing out is a constant process were, unfortunately, you have to pick and choose your moments.\n\nThey may have been right this time and there was no harm. What if there's a problem with the next person they tell?\n\nThe world can be dangerous for those who aren't considered the norm.\n\nEducate your friends and if they don't apologize. Find better friends.", "NTA\n\nIt feels like pretty common sense to not tell others things that you are told privately. \n\nHowever, if your friends have done this before, and they told A now, I think you can safely say they are not friends that you should confide secrets in anymore", "They\u2019re not your friends.\n\nNTA", "NTA.

Gross breach of trust on their part.\n\nINFO Is this the same A whose bday party you missed, the same group you were thinking about leaving for your online friends and is Mark in this group?", "No. You are not the ah. They were wrong. And I would consider keeping them all at an equal and farther distance from now on. If they cannot see where they were wrong, they will do it again. Clearly you should not trust the two blabbermouths. And to insist you trust them all the same is wrong. If they want to be the same then maybe you need to downgrade them all.", "NTA. It's your choice to tell whomever you feel comfortable telling. It isn't their information to spread. I'd be angry too. It should be at your pace and your comfort level, not theirs. Shame on them.", "NTA - Your friends outed you and thats nerver okay.", "If you worry that they will tell the whole class then why did you tell them? You said they did that before", "INFO. What does being part of a \"friend group of four\" mean to you? To me it suggests that you just don't have three people you consider friends, but that you hang out with these same three people a lot. In that case it would be awkward and uncomfortable if two of them know about your sexual orientation and one does not. What is their to gain for you if all but one of the group knows this? If you don't want everyone else to know, you could talk about it when you four are together, and ask them to keep this info within the four of you.", "ESH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
