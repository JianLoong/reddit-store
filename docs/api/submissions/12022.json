She just doesn't sound like a morning person (like recognizes like) or possibly a 'I don't like people' person in general.  By not interacting with each other more than you need to, I think you're both getting what you want.

I once had a coworker who would never say hi to me or speak to me, ever. I said hello everyday for a year before giving up and accepting that she was a passive aggressive jerk. She just didn\u2019t like me and wouldn\u2019t bother with common courtesy. There was nothing else to it.", "Is it possible that you're misinterpreting her good morning?  Some people aren't actually irritated, that's just their voice or it takes awhile to warm up to being around people. You don't know her well at all. I am equating this to someone having resting B face and always being asked why they are angry or upset, and maybe they should smile more.  Maybe she has a fight going on in the morning with her kids, husband, whatever.  None of your business.  She would always say hi back.  She wasn't rude. Just not as bubbly. Maybe she starts her day in a routine. Who knows. \n\nYou stopping saying hello is a conscious move. Not everyone can be your sweet as pie coworker. You cleat don't let it roll off and it is your change in behavior that has caused a negative environment,  not hers. \n\nEta she is clearly having issues with her mom as mentioned in another comment. Also while yes she talks about a lot, some people's coping strategy is to look like an open book to hide the worst thi gs going on. And asking her about it in Publix is awkward.  And yes she will be awkward with you since you think so little of her you can't even say good morning to her. \n\nYTA.", "NTA: I'm an upbeat morning person. Obnoxious upbeat morning person as someone once told me. I try to tone it down when not around others like me.\n\nIt could be you're my type of morning person and your coworker isn't, but you write she's nasty to you and another employee but super friendly with everyone else? She has a problem. You can ask her what her situation is and let her know you won't socialize with her at work if she's going to be rude to you.", "NTA Your coworker has an attitude problem. She needs to make up her mind. Either she wants you to greet her or she doesn't. She can't have it both ways.", "NTA, i think you should bring it up with her or the boss though. It's fine if she doesn't want pleasantries but she cannot ignore you on work related matters.", "NTA you don\u2019t owe anything to anyone, in terms of being polite. Especially when that person isn\u2019t nice in return.", "Here\u2019s the thing. You can\u2019t read other peoples minds. They may appear grumpy, irritated, cold - but there are a number of reasons people show that behavior. To take it personally and get offended is a huge mistake.\n\nSometimes people are like that because they\u2019ve had an extremely dark and loveless life and they just need time to warm up - but they are the ones who need the kindness and the warming the most.\n\nThis is not applying to someone who personally attacks you, insults you, or specifically tells you to shut up and stop greeting them. This is applying to people who may not speak in the warmest tone - but they don\u2019t say anything personally offensive - for example, the cold \u201chello\u201d they said in return.  \n\nYou don\u2019t know the situation they are leaving to come to work. You might be the only person to say kind words to them that entire day - heck, that entire year - and they just don\u2019t know how to respond.", "NTA. Objectively, your response was reasonable. If people are rude to you, it pushes them away. There's a limit to how long people should expect you to be the better person if they're mistreating you.", "NAH\n\nNot everybody is a morning person.

The fryer, decorators come in and I greet them as usual. 5 am comes around and the opener comes in and I would usually greet her too. Well the past few weeks she\u2019s been coming in with an attitude and every time I would greet her she would give me a cold and irritated hello. I don\u2019t hold grudges and thought nothing of it until she just would just gesture when I asked her simple questions about orders with an attitude and continued being like that. She didn\u2019t only do it to me but also another lady that is sweet as pie but would go and act over friendly with other coworkers. Well I said I\u2019ll just leave her be she doesn\u2019t owe me a greeting and will just talk to her when needed such as orders and items needed. I don\u2019t acknowledge her when she comes in as she doesn\u2019t to me either but people ask if we\u2019re fighting and I said no I just don\u2019t want to bother her seeing how irritated she gets. Now she acts awkward around me and tends to avoid me while I just act as usual and don\u2019t feel awkward at all. Somehow she feels offended and just plain ignores me when I ask her about work related stuff.  I understand if you want to be left alone and will gladly leave you be as I don\u2019t want your negative emotions directed at me while being nice to others. Like I said we don\u2019t owe each other anything but taking your negative emotions toward me bc your still sleepy or tired is not my problem nor want to deal with it. I\u2019ve never let my emotions take over and snap back at her,raised my voice or be nasty toward her. All I would do was just say good morning. So AITA for not greeting my coworker anymore?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If she\u2019s not a morning person, maybe it\u2019s time to find a job that doesn\u2019t start at 5am. \n\nIt just sounds like she\u2019s a passive aggressive AH. Who has something against you she won\u2019t say, because it\u2019s made up in her head.", "NTA. \n\nI don\u2019t think you should be a supplicant to her. It is her problem that she\u2019s rude. Like you stated in your post neither of you owe anything to each other. Ignore her.", "NTA", "NAH. She might just have beliefs about you that are incorrect. But she also has no obligation to be friendly or talkative. But if you need to communicate on a regular basis because it involves work, and you sense antagonism, then this is a matter that should be resolved by a higher up. It's possible this person struggles with her tone, but a certain amount of respect is preferable when it comes to work relationships.\n\nInfo: What exactly is the work related stuff you need to ask her about? Is it required that you two have to speak to each other?", "NTA, maybe just pull her aside and ask her what\u2019s up, maybe she doesn\u2019t like the greetings, or maybe the eres something else, personal or interpersonal. Just be like \u201chey, I stopped saying hello in the mornings cuz it seemed like you weren\u2019t a fan of it, but joe it seems like that\u2019s caused friction too. What\u2019s going on, how do we get to being okay?\u201d\n\nLike, the only way you actually fix this is by not trying to be a mind reader, trying to alter your behavior on what you THINK is going on in a persons head just never works out in your favor.", "Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Just recently she started acting cold and I would ask her if she was ok and got the same response of either a head shake or no. I would even ask her if she needed a coffee seeing how tired she was but would say no.

I know people like that. Just ignore them", "In all honesty idk I did ask her if she was ok if I did anything to upset her but she would just shake her head no.", "Mainly orders I need to relay since it falls on me to tell her.

Sometimes inventory and supplies but mainly orders.", "I\u2019m not being a mind reader I actually asked her if she\u2019s ok or if I did something to upset her but like I said she would just shake her head or say no. I don\u2019t tend to be nosy in peoples lives but if I can help by making her feel better I wouldn\u2019t mind lending an ear if she needs it.  She\u2019s not just cold to me but also the other coworker I mentioned who is super sweet and has a heart of gold. Idk if it\u2019s the age difference I\u2019m 30f she\u2019s 22f or that I don\u2019t snap back at her?", "I would pull her aside and have a dedicated conversation. For all you know, her mom just died and she\u2019s not looking to air that out and start sobbing while you\u2019re all trying to start your shifts in the middle of the kitchen floor. Stop the motion, sit down, express how her actions have made you feel, that you want to have a good relationship and want to know the way she\u2019d prefer to be interacted with right now, and ask if there\u2019s anything else going on.", "You asked if she was OK, she shook her head and said no and you just...what? Did nothing?  I'm lost.  If you did nothing after she said she was not OK, then yeah,  I get why she's cold.

It's also v petty to keep doing it, and I approve 1000%", "Okay but you said you asked that in the middle of the workfloor. What if her mom just died? You think she\u2019s gonna open up about that when you\u2019re all in the middle of getting ready for that day? Like I still think you\u2019re not the asshole but I think the only way to fix this is to genuinely sit her down, put the two of you on the same side of the problem and try and work out how you two can interact in a way that doesn\u2019t cause friction.", "She openly talks about leaving her house and how much she dislikes her mom and very explicit things out in the open where customers can hear. It has actually caused her to get written up as well wearing ear pods during business hours where she ignores customers bc she can\u2019t hear them.  She started changing after that."]}
