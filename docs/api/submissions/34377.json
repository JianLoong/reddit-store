Presumptuous, and you also capitalized the word \"Countries\" for no reason.\n\n3) Angus said they haven't been to the US in 2 decades.\n\n4) You asked them a ridiculous rhetorical question. Obviously, nobody has lived in every country in the world. The point you were (badly) trying to make is that Angus shouldn't say it's weird to kiss kids on the mouth unless they have complete and total encyclopedic knowledge of every culture on the planet so that they know exactly where it's considered normal to kiss kids on the mouth. This is some very faulty logic and people downvoted you for it. Also, you capitalized Country and World for no reason.\n\n5) They said they have not lived in every single country in the world. You became confused by this. Understandably so, because you don't seem very smart. You asked them: What does that have to do with the fact that kissing family and friends on the lips is common in some countries?\n\nThat's what's called a strawman argument. You created a phony argument and responded to it, and acted like it was what Angus said. First, you changed \"kids\" to \"family and friends\", which aren't equivalent. Second, because Angus never claimed that (wherever he lives) has anything to do with (wherever you live) thinking it's okay to kiss kids on the lips. He only gave his own opinion, and it's obviously going to be colored by his culture's norms. Some cultures think it's weird to kiss kids on the lips. It's OK for them to think that. Some cultures think it's fine to kiss kids on the lips. That's OK too.\n\nWhat's not OK is for (whatever your culture is) demanding that (Angus's culture) think that it's OK to kiss kids on the lips.

Again, super fucking weird that you think it is. Kissing plays a pivotal role in the preverbal communication between baby and parents/guardians.
