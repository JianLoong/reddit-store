Also, [testing for it outside of an outbreak is not always reliable, so even if you have it, you might not get a positive test result](https://www.cdc.gov/std/herpes/screening.htm).       \n\nHerpes does not always mean genital herpes, and does not always mean that you will ever have open sores. STD testing during pregnancy is standard where I live, but that doesn't include testing everyone in the pregnant woman's life.", "They may still have it, just haven't had a reaction yet... my sister had mononucleosis as a child, and has a bunch of health issues now. Ofc, I'm not saying they were all caused by Epstein\u2013Barr virus but it sure didn't help and sure wasn't needed.\n\nWhat confuses me is when people do things that are completely unnecessary for whatever selfish reason they imagine. There are plenty of ways to show affection that don't put your child at risk, why kissing on the lips, what's there to gain other than being \"edgy\"?", "Anyone who can't consent to it, yes. Any child, yes. If your partner understands that risk and is fine with it, by all means, kiss away. \n\nI am assuming that you know when herpes is contagious, but by looking at the comments, many don't.", "Exactly what I was thinking about... I'd be so pissed too. I'm sorry you have to deal with it.", "50 - 80% of Americans have HSV 1, it\u2019s more common than not", "This is a really nasty judgmental comment given how people just above you are pointing out how they got herpes from family members as literal children, and 50-80% of American adults are estimated to have cold sores. \"Riddled with STDs\" indeed.", "Of course. It\u2019s better to just err on the side of caution and tell new parents not to kiss their babies on the mouth or introduce them to sick people.\n\nLike I said, still a far stretch from saying babies have literally zero immune system though.", "omg thank god you asked for clarification because AS THIS IS REDDIT, I thought something horrific.", "*slaps you in the balls* finish the comment before making a remark silly billy.", "Yeah. I\u2019ve never met anyone who kissed their kids (or vice versa) on the mouth. It\u2019s just not common in the US, which is why there was such a media frenzy of sorts around the Brady family when it was \u201crevealed,\u201d for lack of a better word.", "I can read that doesn\u2019t change that your comparison is fucking absurd", "More newborns are infected by being kissed by an adult than by simply going outside you\u2019re absurdity in comparison detracts from the seriousness of the subject", "That's not necessarily true. If the parent is carrying any bug, such as RSV or Herpes, that can be life-threatening for a newborn whose immune system hasn't yet developed. Human mouths carry a huge amount of bacteria and whilst that's not so much of an issue for someone with a developed immune system, it can be very dangerous for someone who has not.", "I got the information from the toothpaste which was prescribed to me by a dentist when I had gum disease.\n\nAs for how to clean the teeth without being bitten? 2 things. Firstly use a toothbrush. It doesn't care about being bitten. Secondly, don't put your fingers in a child's mouth. They probably have FAR more dangerous germs on them.\n\nAs for the toothpaste being a disinfectant... I never said or thought that. Please don't pretend I did. But to that point you are missing a step in the process of gum disease/tooth decay.\n\nThe bacteria itself doesn't cause the tooth decay directly. the bacteria eats the food which is left in the mouth and creates an acid as waste product. The acid is what causes all the trouble. You don't need to disinfect a mouth to keep the level of acids low. A healthy diet and clean teeth will reduce the amount of food the bacteria can eat, and therefore reduce the amount of the acid created. Cavities usually happen after a buildup of plaque over the teeth which can be prevented by avoiding too much sugary foods and by cleaning regularly.\n\nMy source for all of this is the dentist I take my toddler to.", "Not kissing the child.on the lips won't prevent it either.thats why you have to clean their teeth!", "Some things are just weird they need no explanation.", "It\u2019s possible to be asymptomatic and still pass on deadly viruses to children. Note I am not only speaking about fucking HSV \ud83d\ude44", "I think you seriously don't understand that some of us live in developed countries where blood tests are readily available. Getting tested for STDs isn't just a matter of someone looking at you through a magnifying glass and declaring that they can't see any open sores so it's probably fine.\n\nYes, I'm aware swab tests exist but as you yourself pointed out, they're not reliable.", "Yes, it's very common in third world countries, but some of us live in the developed world where we have access to health care and proper pathology services.", "Nobody does it to be edgy, wtf? \n\nAs i said, its common here and professionals only warn you to be very carefull around young babies. \n\nAlso its not as if i kiss them constantly. It just happens sometimes.  When my 2 year old comes over and kisses me i will not turn away.", "Yes, I did acknowledge that it's very common in third world countries.\n\nSome of us live in the developed world with access to health care and proper pathology.", "Very fair", "Please stop claiming it\u2019s not common in the US.

Don't breathe near them. Don't kiss them on the hands of face. Don't let them stay in the same room as any other child ever.\n\nIt's funny how your two examples are 1)the common cold, which your baby will catch simply by being in the same house as someone who is ill, and 2) herpies. \n\nWhen I give you medical source about how not to pass herpies all of a sudden it's not important.\n\nYou can't stop a child getting germs in them, or getting sick. If you have a cold and you even play with the baby for a few minutes you have exposed it to the virus.\n\nIf a parent kisses their child on the mouth, the child isn't going to come into contact with any germs that they wouldn't come into contact with anyway.", "I think you seriously don\u2019t understand that HSV can be missed on a blood test as can RSV which is why \n\nMEDICAL PROFESSIONALS IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD SAY NOT TO KISS BABIES ON THEIR FACE OR HANDS", "Blood tests for HSV-1 are not always accurate.", "The US is not a third world country. I'm sure there are more people in your country who have herpes than you realize, especially since many people never have any symptoms.              \n\nBut the most accurate way to diagnose is to culture active sores, because blood tests only check for antibodies, which may not always be present.", "Arranged marriages are also common in some parts of the world, still doesn't make it right. \"Common\" means nothing other than \"many people here are stupid together\".\n\nYou really shouldn't need professionals telling you not to put you saliva on children.

Pray tell where do you live, on the moon?", "Wtf? I was raised in the south and never kissed my parents on the lips nor seen anyone do it. lol people getting down voted for saying it's weird when IT IS FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T DO IT. I think it's weird that people like mustard. Doesn't mean it's wrong or I think people who like mustard like it sexually. LoL I don't think kids kissing their parents on the lips is sexual at all. Fucking weird to suggest otherwise. But it's still just weird. Nothing more than it just being different from my normal. Crazy how much ridiculous back and forth this is getting", "Do you think the child won't have oral bacteria?", "I am a woman who went through a lot of effort to get pregnant.
