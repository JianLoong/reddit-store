(about 20 minutes from our houses, but in opposite directions). \n\nI live with one other guy, Luke 30M. Tessa and Luke hit it off quickly too and developed a good friendship. Luke is single and has been the entire time Tessa and I have been together. \n\nLuke and Tessa work in the same district and are only a few blocks away from eachother. For the past 3 months, they have been getting lunch together every  Monday and Friday. Those days their schedules line up, and they thought it would be fun. They both asked if I was ok with this beforehand, and I said sure. \n\nIt's been fine until now. Luke talks about Tessa 24/7 and seems to be into her. They have inside jokes I am not apart of. They text constantly and joke around. She asks his opinion on her outfits, instagram posts, etc. \n\nThey want to go to a concert together this next Friday while I work late. I told Tessa I'm not comfortable with their friendship anymore and would like her to maintain a distance from Luke, and she got really upset saying I'm trying to control her.

Either they really are just good friends, in which case you *are* being controlling and are going to alienate both of them -- or there *is* something there, and asking them to stay apart isn't going to stop it from developing. Sorry, OP, but there's not much you can do here. Good luck.", "NTA\n\nI think your gut is probably right on this one.", "NTA. It doesn\u2019t seem like Tessa is into Luke but if Luke is into Tessa, it would be in both of their best interests to distance themselves out of respect for you and Tessa\u2019s relationship, and so that they can let it fizzle out if any party does have feelings. They shouldn\u2019t be as close as you and your gf are. There needs to be some kind of distinction between a romantic relationship and a platonic relationship. You could suggest they hangout as a group with you. Did you tell Tessa Luke is into her? If you did, what was their reaction?", "ESH/ NTA\n\nDon't listen to the Reddit bros.\n\nPeople can just be friends but at the end of the day if it makes you uncomfortable you just need to open up dialogue with both of them individually and express your feelings on the matter.\n\nGive them the opportunity to reassure you or take on board your feelings. Decide what you want from there.\n\nIf you can't look past it and trust her, then maybe question if that's a relationship you want. But that's just how I would feel personally. I trust my gf enough to be friends with my friends and hang out with other guys because I know 100% she would never regardless of their intentions. If I didn't I wouldn't be with her.", "Yeah bro red flags abound all around here man.  The fact that both got upset means something was happening even if it was an emotional affair.  The fact she's gaslighting you and calling you controlling and then told Luke behind your back is just wrong.  I'm afraid this situation may have already gone too far bro.  Only way to salvage:\n\n1.  Confront Luke man to man.  Ask him point blank if he has feelings for your gf.  Tell him  that friend to friend your telling him you are uncomfortable with their relationship and as a friend and roommate he should respect it.  If he confesses he does, most likely he's confessed it to her...\n\n2.  Sit her down and be honest with her.  Tell her this is now a deal breaker and if she can't respect this boundary and put your relationship above him then it's time to end it because you won't play second fiddle.  Tell her you never anticipated that their friendship would cross this line and would have never been comfortable with it had you known.\n\nYou'll know instantly how both react whether something has happened...", "A lot of people on this thread don't think it's possible to control their libido while alone with a person they find attractive. I just can't fathom the lack of impulse control in these people.  They will never understand that the majority of people can control impulses and have cognitive ability to understand cheating is horrible.", "NTA. I had this situation once, with a boyfriend and a close friend. They both assured me they were not interested in each other and were only buddies. I trusted them. Yada yada yada, they hooked up.\n\nIn this, and other observances, if someone is committed to mongamy, they avoid the possibility of \"it just happened\" regret, biology being what it is. Only you know what you're willing to accept in a relationship.", "YTA- because of how you went about this. Instead of bringing your concerns to your girlfriend and discussing what boundaries you would both be comfortable with, you just told her that she's not allowed to hang out with her friend anymore. That is controlling. If you are worried Luke is into her, than TELL HER. Explain what about his behavior makes you think this and have an adult discussion about it. You can't just make demands of people without explanation and expect them to be fine with it. Whether the two of them have developed feelings for each other, or they are actually just friends, this approach is wrong either way. Some of your concerns are valid but the way you're trying to \"fix\" this is only going to backfire.", "NTA. I really don't think Luke has good intentions here, and honestly I believe Tessa knows but doesn't care. As a woman I don't befriend and hang out with single men one on one TWICE A WEEK while I am in a relationship. Especially with them texting 24/7 and Luke talking about her all the time - that shows to me that he is clearly interested in her and needs to back off. Tessa needs to set boundaries as well; I seriously doubt she is oblivious to Luke's advances.", "The second he wouldn\u2019t shut up about her is the moment you should\u2019ve just whipped his ass. Dudes don\u2019t sit around and talk about women they aren\u2019t fucking.", "Jonah Hill?", "YTA\n\nLook. If she has feelings for your roommate, no amount of control will change that she has feelings for someone else. Let\u2019s say they never hang out again, you\u2019re still in a relationship with someone who has feelings for someone else. You can\u2019t put that bullet back in that gun. **If she\u2019s cheating or considering cheating, but you make her stop hanging out with him\u2026do you think everything suddenly goes back to normal?**\n\nEither you trust your girlfriend or you don\u2019t. If you do, you shouldn\u2019t have anything to worry about. If you don\u2019t\u2026well you\u2019ve got bigger problems that won\u2019t just go away if she stops hanging out with this guy.", "YTA. You can't tell your girlfriend who she can or can't hang out with. You should have told her how you feel. If she cared about you, she would have modified their friendship dynamics. But now she sees you as controlling. So she won't change the way they interact (because it would be agreeing to be controlled) and perhaps will even break up with you.", "YTA\n\nDoes your situation suck? Yes, absolutely, it sucks. I've been there! \n\nBut you're in a lose/lose situation and you took the choice where you're absolutely the bad guy\n\nNow you're the controlling jerk who's not letting two friends spend time together because of jealousy. If anything had a chance of happening, you've now guaranteed it will happen.\nIf it wasn't going to happen, you have torpoedoed your relationship with your roommate and your girlfriend simultaneously\n\nYou should have talked to your GF about your concerns openly without making demands, try and figure out a way to ease your concerns without controlling her life, but no, you went from 0-100 and hit the nuclear option", "Don't work too late.", "NTA.

They\u2019re fucked in the head for thinking that\u2019s ok.", "NTA let just say she isnt your gf anymore.\n\nAlso everytime stories like this come up you will always find the \"stop controlling\" dumbasses.

They\u2019re supposed to ignore eachother in your hall ways and in the kitchen too?", "Your insecurities are going to cost you your gf. It would have been better to tell her that you are concerned that he may be developing feelings for her because of the way he talks about her and it is starting to make you uncomfortable, then put the ball in her court. Stepping in and telling her who she is and is not allowed to have lunch with is overstepping, even if it is a friend of yours you are talking about. YTA - for trying to dictate where discussion is appropriate.", "Esh, you cant tell her who she can be friends with. You can set boundaries. For example you can ask her not to ask his opinion on outfits and social media posts. You can explain it makes you uncomfortable. That felt like yellow flag to me. For thats normal for girls to do with their friends but a male friend you share with your partner eh. \n\nIt does sound like sometimes whether intentional or not they exclude you in conversation due to inside jokes. For that ill call them light ah for it is rude to do if everyone included in the conversation. Especially if originally she over to hang out with you then excludes you. \n\nI could be reaching but it seems like you might feel second to their friendship. If thats the case you should sit down with your gf and have an honest conversation. She probably not aware of your feelings and cant fix anything if you dont tell her.", "You are definitely the AH.  \n\nYou are the common link between the 2 of them and now by telling her she can't be friends you have let them both think, or know, that you don't trust them together.  Have they done anything to deserve this or are you just the jealous type?", "I'm sorry man. What a rough situation. And if things take a turn for the worse, you'll then be frowned upon for being skeptical of your future gf hanging with a guy that's \"just a friend\". Just hold any anger in and let it go. I wish you the best.", "YTA. They ran it past you before they started to hang out, and now, just because you don't like that they get on, you want to move the goalposts. So what if Luke is into her? As long as she isn't in to him, you have nothing to worry about. This all comes down to whether you trust your girlfriend.", "YTA. You cannot tell your GF who she can be friends with.", "I wouldn't trust neither one of them. Dump her ass and put his ass out immediately. Something's going on.", "NTA...\n\nAwkward scenarios:\n\n1) Your roommate is into your gf, and he makes a move and she turns him down. It will be awkward between your gf and roommate, and when you find out, it will be awkward for all of you.\n\n2) If they are into each other, you won't find out until either they get caught, or after the fact when either of them tells you.

I've been married a long time, I don't cheat, and I don't deserve to be treated like a cheater.", "Personal anecdotes aren\u2019t proof of anything, because not everyone is going to react the same way as you, which is clearly what you\u2019re expecting here.", "If it\u2019s both men and women, why did you tell the other commenter they must be a woman?", "Your love and respect for your partner sounds truly real...", "Right and the same point goes to u.  U assume that he's controlling, she's right, and the roommate doesn't have feelings.  Perhaps, they will have maturity to work it through and be stronger.  Yall need to stop deflecting your own insecurities on here...", "I never understood being in a relationship with someone I could not trust.  If I'm going to be with you, then trust needs to be a big part of that.  And yes, I absolutely trust my partner and he trusts me.  (Honesty and communication go a long way towards making sure we both feel secure in this relationship.)", "I haven\u2019t used any personal anecdotes here. I\u2019m not the one faulting people for not reacting in this situation the exact same way I would or did. You\u2019re assuming he\u2019s right, and that she\u2019s cheating, just because she reacted in a way that you don\u2019t personally approve of.", "Or here's a thought.  If you truly love and respect your SO you'd never put them in a situation where they HAVE to trust you concerning these things.  How many issues would be never had if partners would say, ya know what I honor and love my partner and because of that I don't want to put them in a place where they'd have to trust nothing happened...", "Her reaction is over the top no doubt about it.  He asked her to distance herself from him, ASKED, she could have said no, instead she accused him of controlling.  It's not a healthy response to a request.  Didn't accuse her of cheating but the chances of an emotional affair are high for sure...", "Because that is an imaginary line with no real definition.  (And one which is solely based on the level of the other person's insecurities.)\n\n\nIs sending them a Christmas card every year over the line? (Why are you keeping in touch with that person of the opposite sex?)\n\n\nIs talking on the phone over the line?  (Why are you on the phone with someone of the opposite sex?)\n\n\nIs getting together for lunch over the line?\n\n\nDinner?\n\n\nEtc etc\n\n\nAnd for each of these, the next question becomes what is the exact frequency or duration that makes the behavior in question acceptable vs not acceptable?  A phone call or lunch once a year? Once a month? Once a week?\n\n\nMy point is that all of these are incredibly subjective and are things that you and your partner should be discussing if there are concerns.  And if my partner expresses discomfort about something I would never ignore that!  But we also both know that our insecurities are not what drive our relationship... Our trust of each other is.  And that ultimatums are almost never the way.\n\n\nIf I didn't trust him, I wouldn't be with him.  Period.", "The OP said she got \u201cangry.\u201d Where did you get \u201cover the top\u201d from one word?"]}
