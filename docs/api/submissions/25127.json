My mom died during childbirth of my younger brother, Tommy, and I have an older brother. \n\nThroughout my childhood, my dad routinely showed little care towards me, often completely ignoring my existence short of providing clothing and food. \n\nAs soon as I turned 14 and was able to work, I had to pay for anything I wanted aside from clothes and food. Even basic hygiene products like deodorant, body wash, or tampons I had to provide myself. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t uncommon for my dad to leave me at home with a microwaveable meal while he took my brothers out for dinner and a movie or a sports game. He often told me to my face that he didn\u2019t want a daughter and hated my existence. \n\nI started drinking and smoking weed heavily at 16 to cope, which tanked my grades. After high school, I had to go to community college and struggle to provide housing for myself while not failing my courses. \n\nRecently I learned from Tommy that my father had passed due to cancer, and was asked to speak at his funeral. I accepted, with the plan to only really say basic formalities or something like that. \n\nHowever I had a few drinks at the funeral and was particularly annoyed by the fact that everyone he knew seemed to only have positive things to say, and when it was my turn to speak I aired out his laundry. \n\nI gave a brief story of how my life went and how his neglect and mistreatment led to a few years of alcoholism and a complete inability to hold a relationship due to not understanding how to show love for someone. \n\nEverybody was silent after I finished, and after I left I got some dms on Instagram from both sides, some people saying I had no right to speak about a dead man that way, and others saying if he treated me like that then it was only right for me to speak up. \n\nI\u2019m kind of torn, I made that choice while drunk, but I don\u2019t exactly regret it either. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1692568439, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15wo864/aita_for_going_over_my_dads_favoritism_when_asked/", "score": 728, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were asked to speak up and you did. If people had a problem with it they should've spoken instead, plus being dead doesn't absolve you of your sins or failures it just means they can't try to make up for them.\n\nIf you don't feel bad about it then you're fine I'm sure part of you needed to let it out", "NTA\n\nAll those annoyed people probably watched on as your father treated you like that.

He was an abusive neglectful dad. \n\nWhat did your brother expect you\u2019d say? He observed the abuse himself. He turned a blind eye, doesn\u2019t mean you forgot all that! \n\nTreat it as a way of moving on from your past. Anyone who calls you out, tell them this\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great you are defending the honor of a dead man! It would have been even better had you spoken about the neglect and abuse of a child.

There's a not-great book called Speaker For the Dead that has a concept of a person who gives an honest eulogy that talks about faults as well as virtues, and I've always thought it made a lot of sense. The only people that could have been truly hurt by it were those that ignored it, or that he lied to. Fuck the first, and the second, he hurt them, not you.\n\nAll the best, and this has helped me decide I'm not going to speak at my father's funeral.", "I don't get it, those who got annoyed why didn't they say so on your face?

I am sorry for your loss of childhood, for your shifty siblings who stood by, and this isn't a case of  they knew a different person. Live your best life, because now and truly no one can stop you.

You made this about your grievances with your father. It would have been better to simply decline and if asked why, tell people that you had nothing kind to say.\n\nThat said: I understand why you ended up speaking like that and I do sympathize that you probably feel you never got any closure. I am guessing seeing people, who never saw how he treated you, talk about the good he did, must have been incredibly hurtful.\n\nSo, I don\u2019t think you chose the right time or manner to speak up. But I also don\u2019t think you did anything fundamentally wrong. You spoke your truth and people know how he treated you.", "Nta.", "NTA -- The ones who are upset with you are wrestling with their own unflattering legacies and putting their shame on you. There is a saying, \"Hit dogs holler.\" It sounds like more than one person realizes they failed you by not noticing the abuse or are abusive themselves. It gets uncomfortable being confronted with the possibility of your cruelty coming to light. That isn't your problem.  \n\n\nMy condolences for the pain you've experienced. You deserve love and respect, make that an absolute threshold for those wishing to be in your life. Everyone else can lose their access to you and die mad about it.", "NTA- good for you for speaking the truth", "That is\u2026rough. I\u2019m really, really sorry, OP. I\u2019m not even particularly comfortable passing judgement here because of how bad all of this sucks, but your father is the one at fault here and in small part whoever thought it was a good idea to ask you to speak after all of that. I don\u2019t necessarily think it\u2019s fair to say that anyone there must have known what was going on as some comments have, since that\u2019s not always the case and lots of abuse can fly completely under the radar - it\u2019s the sad reality of these kinds of situations - but them not knowing doesn\u2019t make it go away, it doesn\u2019t make it any less who he was and it doesn\u2019t mean you have to shield them from it. \n\nI don\u2019t think you should\u2019ve done this, I don\u2019t think it was the right thing to do and it\u2019s possible you\u2019ve done a lot of irreparable damage, but I also do not blame you for it whatsoever. I get the pain of having to sit there while people sing the praises of someone who has damn near destroyed your life and your mind, I really do feel you. None of what happened was your fault, funerals aren\u2019t really the place for bringing up these things, but people also shouldn\u2019t do things they don\u2019t want recounted at their funeral.\n\nI hope you can start to heal, I genuinely hope the outburst (for want of a better word) ends up worth it for you and gives you some catharsis long term and that things get better for you from it, because nobody deserves that. You\u2019re far more than the abuse and this incident, you\u2019re far more than your father, hopefully this can be a turning point for you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It can be hard in an emotional way, but not in a reality way. People can only do so much. It's perfectly fine for them having to act like they tolerate it because the parents are the ones who allow them contact. They have to do it to stay in contact.

The daughters feelings about her father is more important than friends, siblings, cousins..", "Nice victim blaming. Nobody wanted to see what she was going through when he was alive, was that fair to OP? And when she's asked to talk at the funeral she shouldn't be allowed to tell the truth? I bet nobody would want to listen after the funeral either because \"you shouldn't talk ill of the dead\", and then OP is silenced forever.\n\nIf people want to bond over abusers they shouldn't ask the abused to participate in the praise.", ">The norm is to speak positively in that space, so that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen.

I'm sure it would be enlightening.", "CPTSD, Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, is a fairly common diagnosis to give to someone like OP who has stated a long history of abuse and neglect from their parent, and even more common in people like OP who have a history of alcoholism and substence abuse. Substence abuse is defined by using drugs and/or alcohol for 2 or more days in a week, by the way. That one blew my mind. I'm not OPs therapist, or a/their doctor, so I'm not about to say that they 100% have it, but I can understand why people would label their experience as traumatic because they very obviously have been deeply emotionally affected to the point of seeking support even through substences. \n\n\nAnd as for trama alone, the way you're mocking people makes me believe you have an outdated view believing only people returning from war can have Trauma. Trauma can come in many forms from mundane to serious; breaking your arm, for example, is a form of trauma. Depending on the person and how they broke their arm, this can lead to a trauma disorder, example; getting into an accident and breaking your arm is traumatic, but if you can get back to driving and live your life perfectly fine, that's just a wildly bad day that likely cost a lot of time money and pain. VS a parent giving their child a radial arm fracture from yanking around their kid in a fit of rage, because the child was misbehaving in the parents eyes, to them is simply the escalation of their every day. Every day is their version of your worst day car accident, except the car is the person who is meant to love and protect them, and not some stranger or tree that snuck up on you.\n\n\nTo clarify, I'm no doctor, medical professional, or therapist, just a dumbass lib, who unfortunately has a CPTSD diagnosis from 3 seperate medical institutions to make sure the diagnosis is correct. \"OH but they could be lying to you to get money\" mhm, sure, except I don't live in the united states, our healthcare workers are paid shit for their efforts, and I'm not in programs or on meds for something that now I have a name for it I can deal with it myself. \n\n\n\nYou should learn more even if only the surface of what these words mean in a diagnosis and literary sense, talk to more diverse people to try to understand how vastly different everyone can be but also how amazingly similar we all are in the end, as well as to try to develope some empathy. Not everyone deserves empathy from everyone, and not everyone will be empathetic to everyone, but to suggest that every \"lib\" \"lowers the bar\" on what trauma is, leads me to believe that you've lived in a fairly homogenous closed off life doing whatever it is you do. It's fine to live like that, but to show your ass like this, on a post with someone who very obviously had traumatic events in their life, and your response is to mock people who sympathize with OP is a failing within your character.", "how narcissistic and self-absorbed do you have to be to think the public portion of an essential grieving ritual is the perfect time to vomit out the shit you say in therapy? \n\nop 1000% posted for validation and they got it \ud83d\ude44", "Not sure. \n\nThe brothers must have witnessed at least some of their father's verbal, economic, and psychological abuse of OP. \n\nThey likely witnessed her downward spiral.\n\nPerhaps Tommy figured that OP had something to say.", "I'm only going to my sperm donor's funeral for my sister and niece.

She said the Dad said he didn\u2019t want her but it doesn\u2019t say that he said it in front of the brothers. Kids are egocentric, they don\u2019t pay attention to things unless it\u2019s said in front of them.
