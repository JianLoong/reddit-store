My mom died during childbirth of my younger brother, Tommy, and I have an older brother. \n\nThroughout my childhood, my dad routinely showed little care towards me, often completely ignoring my existence short of providing clothing and food. \n\nAs soon as I turned 14 and was able to work, I had to pay for anything I wanted aside from clothes and food. Even basic hygiene products like deodorant, body wash, or tampons I had to provide myself. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t uncommon for my dad to leave me at home with a microwaveable meal while he took my brothers out for dinner and a movie or a sports game. He often told me to my face that he didn\u2019t want a daughter and hated my existence. \n\nI started drinking and smoking weed heavily at 16 to cope, which tanked my grades. After high school, I had to go to community college and struggle to provide housing for myself while not failing my courses. \n\nRecently I learned from Tommy that my father had passed due to cancer, and was asked to speak at his funeral. I accepted, with the plan to only really say basic formalities or something like that. \n\nHowever I had a few drinks at the funeral and was particularly annoyed by the fact that everyone he knew seemed to only have positive things to say, and when it was my turn to speak I aired out his laundry. \n\nI gave a brief story of how my life went and how his neglect and mistreatment led to a few years of alcoholism and a complete inability to hold a relationship due to not understanding how to show love for someone. \n\nEverybody was silent after I finished, and after I left I got some dms on Instagram from both sides, some people saying I had no right to speak about a dead man that way, and others saying if he treated me like that then it was only right for me to speak up. \n\nI\u2019m kind of torn, I made that choice while drunk, but I don\u2019t exactly regret it either. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1692568439, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15wo864/aita_for_going_over_my_dads_favoritism_when_asked/", "score": 209, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were asked to speak up and you did. If people had a problem with it they should've spoken instead, plus being dead doesn't absolve you of your sins or failures it just means they can't try to make up for them.\n\nIf you don't feel bad about it then you're fine I'm sure part of you needed to let it out", "NTA\n\nAll those annoyed people probably watched on as your father treated you like that.

He was an abusive neglectful dad. \n\nWhat did your brother expect you\u2019d say? He observed the abuse himself. He turned a blind eye, doesn\u2019t mean you forgot all that! \n\nTreat it as a way of moving on from your past. Anyone who calls you out, tell them this\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great you are defending the honor of a dead man! It would have been even better had you spoken about the neglect and abuse of a child.

There's a not-great book called Speaker For the Dead that has a concept of a person who gives an honest eulogy that talks about faults as well as virtues, and I've always thought it made a lot of sense. The only people that could have been truly hurt by it were those that ignored it, or that he lied to. Fuck the first, and the second, he hurt them, not you.\n\nAll the best, and this has helped me decide I'm not going to speak at my father's funeral.", "I don't get it, those who got annoyed why didn't they say so on your face? Why on Instagram DMS and why social media are so important nowdays, why ppl are so afraid to confront others. Who follows who, who unfollows who, conspiracy theories, who posted what, what are the replies...

I am sorry for your loss of childhood, for your shifty siblings who stood by, and this isn't a case of  they knew a different person. Live your best life, because now and truly no one can stop you.

People are complex, they fell in the spectrum between saint and monster, never at the extremes.

You made this about your grievances with your father. It would have been better to simply decline and if asked why, tell people that you had nothing kind to say.\n\nThat said: I understand why you ended up speaking like that and I do sympathize that you probably feel you never got any closure. I am guessing seeing people, who never saw how he treated you, talk about the good he did, must have been incredibly hurtful.\n\nSo, I don\u2019t think you chose the right time or manner to speak up. But I also don\u2019t think you did anything fundamentally wrong. You spoke your truth and people know how he treated you.", "Nta.", "NTA -- The ones who are upset with you are wrestling with their own unflattering legacies and putting their shame on you. There is a saying, \"Hit dogs holler.\" It sounds like more than one person realizes they failed you by not noticing the abuse or are abusive themselves. It gets uncomfortable being confronted with the possibility of your cruelty coming to light. That isn't your problem.  \n\n\nMy condolences for the pain you've experienced. You deserve love and respect, make that an absolute threshold for those wishing to be in your life. Everyone else can lose their access to you and die mad about it.", "NTA- good for you for speaking the truth", "That is\u2026rough. I\u2019m really, really sorry, OP. I\u2019m not even particularly comfortable passing judgement here because of how bad all of this sucks, but your father is the one at fault here and in small part whoever thought it was a good idea to ask you to speak after all of that. I don\u2019t necessarily think it\u2019s fair to say that anyone there must have known what was going on as some comments have, since that\u2019s not always the case and lots of abuse can fly completely under the radar - it\u2019s the sad reality of these kinds of situations - but them not knowing doesn\u2019t make it go away, it doesn\u2019t make it any less who he was and it doesn\u2019t mean you have to shield them from it. \n\nI don\u2019t think you should\u2019ve done this, I don\u2019t think it was the right thing to do and it\u2019s possible you\u2019ve done a lot of irreparable damage, but I also do not blame you for it whatsoever. I get the pain of having to sit there while people sing the praises of someone who has damn near destroyed your life and your mind, I really do feel you. None of what happened was your fault, funerals aren\u2019t really the place for bringing up these things, but people also shouldn\u2019t do things they don\u2019t want recounted at their funeral.\n\nI hope you can start to heal, I genuinely hope the outburst (for want of a better word) ends up worth it for you and gives you some catharsis long term and that things get better for you from it, because nobody deserves that. You\u2019re far more than the abuse and this incident, you\u2019re far more than your father, hopefully this can be a turning point for you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They\u2019ll even probably tell their own kids that they don\u2019t have it as bad at least instead of offering support", "[removed]", "I stand by what I said. If I didn't like the person or they ruined my life, I'm not going to their funeral.", "It\u2019s really the opposite: don\u2019t go to a funeral if you aren\u2019t ok hearing people talk positively about the person who died. The norm is to speak positively in that space, so that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. Funerals have never been the time to air dirty laundry, as significant as it might be. \n\nAlso, there is also a proper place for trauma, frankly. It\u2019s one thing to share the truth and ask for support and set boundaries. It\u2019s another to drop your trauma on other people with no warning or consent. Dropping this kind of trauma on people who are already emotional is not fair.", "I'm gonna be honest. I've never heard of anyone having booze at the funeral... after.... when people have a \"get together\" where there's food.... at someone's house.... But not like... everyone drinking at the church or funeral home. \n\nAnd I agree. I'd NEVER attend the funeral of someone I didn't like. I just don't get the reasoning.", "Oh some of the later stuff in the quartet is pretty terrible. Xenocide (#3) is\u2026 mixed but has some strong parts, and Children of the Mind (#4) is where the author\u2019s weird fundie stuff really starts to swallow up the work. It gets far worse in the Shadows spin-offs from there.", "Oh yea definitely people be part of the problem", "The only people that could be hurt were people that ignored the abuse, or people that he lied to about it, right?  If the latter, do you think it's better that they were ignorant forever about it? Honest question.", "I didn't mean the brothers but the other family members. Her brothers fucked up by asking her to speak when they know how abusive their father was, though, right?", "I never said she did get back and him just that victims can. \n\nThe only people who would be hurt by her revealing these things at his funeral or the people who knew and just didn't care or did anything about it. If it hurts you to find out that someone you cared about is an abuser then that's on you. Part of a funeral is accepting the good and the bad that someone's done in their life.", "Well if they were the type to stand by and allow this toxic behavior to go on and never speak up and then they decided I don't want a relationship with you then I say good riddance.", " You made this about your grievances with your father.", "I went to my paternal grandfather\u2019s funeral purely to cement in my mind that he was dead and gone and unable to hurt anyone else ever again. \n\nIt gave me a lot of closure. \n\nBut I also didn\u2019t say anything unlike OP. Though I don\u2019t think anyone at my grandfather\u2019s funeral was under the illusion he had a single redeemable quality", "I think I stopped at Xenocide 'cuz it felt off. Like he was fighting with his own narrative.", "I disagree. People mourn their abusers sometimes. Again, not always. I don\u2019t want to get into too much speculation about the real feelings of people I don\u2019t know, but I think this could easily hurt other people who were treated horribly but had complicated feelings about their deceased loved one.\nTo answer your question though, no, I think for OPs sake, they shouldn\u2019t be ignorant about it. But there are times that are not the funeral that are much more appropriate for everyone involved to talk about this.", "The brothers were children when the abuse was happening. How were children supposed to stop their father\u2019s actions? It\u2019s a scary feeling to have zero family members in one\u2019s life. I hope OP gets into recovery and builds a support network.", "Comment stolen in part from u/AlexRyang comment further down.", "Totally fair. I can\u2019t blame anyone for nope-ing out at some of the stuff in Xenocide.", "But how could that mourning, by someone he abused, be ruined by hearing that he was an abuser? They know that already. \n\nIt is not on traumatized victims of abuse to be perfect, or even as rational or controlled as an average person, especially in a triggering environment. Expecting that is just not rational.", "That her brothers invited her to speak shows a weird callousness on their part."]}
