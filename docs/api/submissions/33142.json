My kids (unfortunately) have all three. \n\nFever is a reoccurring issue with POTS. You will run fever for no reason at all. Blood pressure that drops in a blink of an eye. Also high adrenaline levels, that causes the heart rate to spike, and drop at times. The right medication helps with these issues. \n\nWith EDS your joints will hurt for absolutely no reason at all!!! I have this as well. Cartilage deterioration is the cause. In EDS patients this is a high pain problem.

You're just reminding her of the stakes, not intentionally being hurtful!", "You could have been dying in the hospital incident even medical professionals were not sure. NTA but your only option here is to do what it takes to get around your mum and make sure you survive until you can do so without her, you know you are right but pick your battles carefully.", "NTA\n\nThere is no way you can make her look like an awful mother in that situation if she wasn't being one and she proved she was one when she got mad at you for calling an ambulance when you needed help. Then repeating \"you're not dying\" multiple times after you had an extensive hospital visit? Awful.\n\nedited from nah to nta because i accidentally put the wrong judgment", "The list of diagnoses you have is a well known cocktail in the medical community and frequently does come associated with a bit of hypochondria- your mom likely has gotten guidance on that and may feel like making light of your symptoms is the best way to support you. In that case, NAH. \n\nBut look, even if your list of diseases are seen frequently, it is still not understood why most treatments (other than psychiatric and functional medicine) hasn\u2019t been very effective. Frankly it makes sense that people who have poorly controlled symptoms - pots, abdominal migraines etc \u2026 without a clearly treatable unifying cause would have a bit of hypochondria. You might be rare that, despite your chronic symptoms, you don\u2019t get anxious about whether or not new symptoms are serious, but your mom is doing her best given the guidance she\u2019s undoubtedly received. She doesn\u2019t understand what you\u2019re going through but her apparent lack of empathy is her trying to help you feel better in the only way she knows how. It\u2019s not her fault that the entire medical community doesn\u2019t really know how to help these symptoms stay away either. A lot of the guidance the medical community gives family members is to not worry too much about symptoms that we can\u2019t control. Even with your recent hospitalization for fever and pain - you got testing and empiric therapies for diseases you wound up not having - it just means that the medical community still doesn\u2019t know how to help you but also reinforced to your mom that your symptoms weren\u2019t serious.\n\nSo what I\u2019m trying to say is cut your mom some slack. She doesn\u2019t know what you are going through. Your symptoms are real, but the medical community hasn\u2019t been able to help much and so there\u2019s not a ton of point seeking hospitalizations and specialists when you\u2019ve seen them all already and they don\u2019t have solutions- although rheumatology testing is slowly getting better with time for some of this. But you can\u2019t put your life on pause and wait for the medical community to catch up- instead you are going to have to forge a path forward and continue to live your life despite your symptoms.\n\nNearly everyone with chronic symptoms or chronic disease reports improvement with psychiatric assistance. It\u2019s not that the underlying disease gets treated with cognitive behavioral therapy and lexapro, but people are just in a better spot to handle it all and so they feel better in the whole. Basically, if you are a person who is going to need to handle a lot more symptoms than the average bear, you need to be in an above-average state of mind and not just in a kinda normal mental space to deal with all of this. Please talk to your doctor about getting a psych eval and treatment- not for the autism but for generalized anxiety and other mood disorders and to help you achieve an above average mental space so you can better manage all the other things.", "YTA. You sound like an overly dramatic hypochondriac.\n It must get draining for your mother.", "Yeah, she usually does. She refused to believe I had ADHD or autism until I was diagnosed and adamantly refuses to believe I might have EDS.", "If people have hypochondriasis or anxiety, \"you're not dying\" is not the way to respond to them. There are ways to remind someone to focus, calm down, or ground themselves that don't involve being snappy and dismissive. And even before OP clarified in reply to you, that's clearly not the case here anyways. Your comment is very kind and thoughtful, but I think you may be giving her mother too much credit. She's had multiple chances to react in different ways, and routinely has not done so.\n\nOP has a number of difficult conditions and a very long, serious hospital stay. The fact her mother isn't treating her seriously despite PROOF that something serious happened is terrible. She is continually undermining her valid concerns, being routinely dismissive, and overall just showing incredible disregard and care for her daughter's wellbeing.\n\nTo OP\u2014 I'm sorry you're going through this. You're NTA. I hope your mother straightens up her behaviour and starts caring about your health and safety properly, but if she is how you say she is, I doubt there's much you can do to change her mind. I hope that you at least have other family or friends who are around to support you through your medical conditions. Best of luck dealing with them and I hope your health improves.\n\nAlso, some smartphones have shortcut features you can set up to have emergency information and contacts shown on your lockscreen, and ways of quick dialing emergency numbers. I recommend that you consider setting these up for the future if you have the option to.", "making light of their symptoms whilst op is crying and has called an ambulance, telling them that they just need an ice pack and pain meds when the trained professionals said that something was wrong, her mother is on the verge of medically neglecting op but right op is the hypochondriac here", "I've had a psych eval done before and I don't have hypochondria, all the psych eval revealed was that I have alexithymia.", "I don't understand why you are getting down voted. Your reply is thoughtful and has many valid points. I think a lot of the replies hear ambulance ride and 5 day hospital stay and think must have been serious.  I'm not saying it wasn't.  The op had vague symptoms and low grade fever. The health care staff have to cover all bases and preemptively treat for worst case scenarios as finding answers, waiting for test results,  etc take time and if it is serious time can cost you your life. She is fortunate enough it was not a serious or life threatening illness.  Her mother is probably exhausted,  worried,  and probably getting fed up with lack of answers.", "Yeah, because having a 38.8 \u00b0C is totally normal, that have to be a week in the hospital and being pumped with medicines is totally what people do or experiment every other day, just a walk in the park, you are right, she is a dramatic hypochondriac, tell me where do you acquired your psychology degree?", "Wtf is wrong with her? Honestly OP throw the same thing in her face if she ever asks for anything. And also maybe start documenting all your aches and other things you never know might help later", "So your mom's upset because her true self was seen by outsiders. Specifically the part where she's a neglectful and abusive mother. That's not your problem nor is her image your burden to bare.\n\nDo not hesitate to call an ambulance again if you need to. Your health is far, far more important than your mother's desire to be falsely seen as a good mother.", "But nothing serious did happen.  She had to be treated for something serious in case it was while waiting for test results and diagnosis.  She was discharged after it seems to be she had a routine virus.", "Oh good! I\u2019m glad you are taking care of your mental health and that both your psychiatrist and you are both happy. With all your other symptoms, it can be so easy to forget to take care of that part of ourselves - especially with your autism and adhd to boot. Good luck with everything and I hope your symptoms get easier to manage going forward", "A lot of doctors would look at her list of diagnoses and immediately think hypochondriac. It\u2019s a common association with that list, and so a lot of the counseling given families is about how to help the patient make light of the situation. I\u2019m not saying that it\u2019s right, but it does happen frequently. Receiving IV meds for a week is a lot different from needing them for a week- the meds she listed are not therapies for anything she wound up being diagnosed with. She got out of the hospital because her own body dealt with the illness was flaring at the time. Some would say that supports her being an \u201coverly dramatic hypochondriac\u201d, but I think it just further supports that her medical team doesn\u2019t really know what\u2019s causing her symptoms. Her mom is probably doing the best she can with poor guidance from the kid\u2019s doctors, and as a result is falling short of meeting OPs needs. OP is just a kid and is doing the best she can with being a teen and having chronic illness and not feeling supported by her family - she might not fully understand her mom\u2019s position, but in no way does she deserve a judgement of being an asshole", "She wants a \u201cnormal\u201d daughter and thinks if she ignores OP\u2019s health issues they will just go away. My dad did the same thing. I had a history of unaliving attempts but at 18 he asked me when I\u2019d stop seeing a therapist\u2026", "> The ambulance came and let my mum and I know something was clearly wrong and that I needed to go to the hospital as they suspected that I had viral meningitis and had a fever of 38.8c (101.84 f).\n> \n> I spent a week in hospital, had to get put on oxygen twice, had to have a spinal tap, was getting pumped with anti-viral and anti-bacterial every chance they could, and had my canula tissue. In the end I didn't have viral meningitis but they also had no idea what I had but since I seemed to be getting better they let me go home.\n\nJust because they couldn't provide a diagnosis NOT mean it was a routine virus. She had to get a *spinal tap* and was placed on oxygen. The ambulance clearly stated to both OP and her mother that something was wrong.\n\nI don't know about you, but I've never had a week-long stay in the hospital for a routine virus. And the fact they never found out exactly what it was means that monitoring for a second flare-up or repeat incident is important, because it's very difficult to know whether it might reoccur without that info.", "\"Ignore untill it is no longer your problem\" kind of mind set just fucks up the people around that person. honestly I hope you at least low contact if not no contact with your father at this point or maybe he got therapy himself, whatever it is I hope you are in a better and more loving environment and I OP will be able have a safe and loving environment soon too."]}
