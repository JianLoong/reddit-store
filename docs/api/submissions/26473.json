My daughter's mother says I'm extorting my daughter by setting an \"activity goal\" for buying her a computer/car.", "selftext": "So, long story short; I have a teenage daughter. Her mother and I were never married and haven't lived together for over a decade, and we get along in co-parenting, although it's definitely tough at times.\n\nMy daughter is nearing car age and, as many teenagers are- as I was when I was her age!- she seems to be disinterested in... everything. Texting with friends, etc. She is a pretty good big sister to her younger brothers, and does chores with maybe an overexasperated sigh, but she's a good kid. But otherwise, left to her own devices, she'd chill in her room and binge Netflix and text. Again, at her age, I once bought a case of Jolt! Cola (get off my lawn) and played StarCraft online on a dialup modem from when school let out in Friday until late Sunday night, so I get it.\n\nBut I want to encourage her to do something. Anything. And she mentioned recently wanting a computer and a car, in separate conversations. She wants a computer to be able to do graphic drawing and art (she is a great artist) and obviously, a car at her age.\n\nSo I came up with an idea. I'd ask her to set some sort of activity goal- I don't care what, within reason. Wake up early to take the dogs for a walk every day, pick a club to join, go for a hike every weekend in the mountains nearby, shoot hoops, with a car agree to shuttle her brothers around for X amount of time, pretty much anything at all, as long as there is a reasonable goal and she meets it.\n\nI brought this idea up with my wife, her stepmother, and she thought that sounded great, particularly it being a goal she sets. However, when I broached the idea with my ex/her mom... it didn't go so well.\n\nMy ex said setting such a goal is \"holding it over her head\" and that we should be letting her have these things \"no strings attached\". I was floored. I said that a computer and car aren't things she's entitled to, but I know she wants them and I want to make an achievable goal she sets to encourage her to broaden her horizons and engage herself. This pretty much ended our conversation, as my ex said \"I am done with this\" and told me my wife and I would \"never understand what (she) was talking about because (we) never think anything (we) do is wrong\".\n\nI really don't feel like I'm \"holding\" anything over my daughters head, but maybe ITA?", "created_utc": 1694183013, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16dbz6v/aita_my_daughters_mother_says_im_extorting_my/", "score": 124, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

(Don't know if I'm biased but I recall the smell of the caffein bubbling from the Jolt as well).   You are absolutely correct these are not entitlements and not like holding food, housing, clothes... over her head.  I bet your daughter would even appreciate the opportunity.  Your ex seems opposed to you not just giving to her because its from you.  \n\nIf you have some custody, then there is no reason you can't set that up as a system for your daughter, just focused on your time with her. (Can't keep the ex from allowing her to do nothing)", "NTA.\n\nSounds like a sweet deal.\n\nYour daughter learns some work ethic and you don't feel like you're handing something to her on a silver platter, everybody wins!\n\nSounds to me like your ex would pick fault no matter how you managed this one to be honest, and she doesn't know what extortion actually is...", "NTA\n\nThis is learning about goal setting and working towards them.

In fact, it sounds like the moronic last words of someone who has no other valid argument, so they just throw that out to cover their lazy excuses for an argument.", "NTA.\n\nYour ex is an idiot. \n\nIntrinsic motivation is best, but extrinsic motivation can be very effective.", "Um your daughter clearly does have interests (graphic drawing and art), they\u2019re just not as outdoorsy or sporty as you would like. I\u2019d also push back a little bit against the she\u2019s not entitled to a computer. I haven\u2019t been in high school in years, but by the time I graduated, a computer was needed for nearly every assignment.\n\nAlso, there is a difference between shuttling her brothers around/walking the dog and joining a club for fun. The former is chores; the latter is encouraging her to have hobbies that aren\u2019t on a computer screen. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with the latter but I do think you would be an asshole for making her do chores. Driving her brothers around isn\u2019t really going to broaden her horizons.\n\nMaybe you could compromise?

I don't get it with parents who don't want their kids to have life skills, to achieve goals and earn things?! Like wtf? There is nothing wrong with setting your kid up to achieve a goal and be rewarded for it. It's an excellent way to teach life skills, it's also a great feeling for a kid to see what they can do when focused and broaden their horizons. Yare aren't the AH here.

(If you can afford a car, I assume you can afford a computer since you can afford a car - unless she has a computer and this is just some type of specialty art computer).\n\nI don't think it's extortion, but it's certainly bribery. Are you able to keep that up with the younger kids?  Another thing is WHY is your daughter so disinterested in everything?  Is she really disinterested in EVERYTHING?!  I don't think she needs her life dictated, but I do think she needs to do some self-discovery and bribery may not be the best way to motivate it.  Not everyone wants to go on a hike, so it's hard to tell if she is just in a phase, depressed, or a \"bad kid.\"  Most of these things will self-correct, though, so that's a diff story.\n\nEither way, you are under no obligation to buy her expensive things.  I kind of side with your ex, though.  Bribery is probably the wrong path to choose, but don't just buy her a car. Maybe buy a used \"family\" car and her use of it is contingent on keeping her grades up, and whatever other metrics are fair (then passing it down to her brothers as they turn 16).", "One is not like the other.

I don't know your daughter well enough to assume how much she hates the outdoors. \n\nIf it's just about her liking anything, why can't it be structured around her hobbies, or maybe trying out a hobby.

Having her earn it by ensuring she remains active is a nice way to do it.", "NTA. This is teaching your daughter to work towards things she wants - a skill she will need both when she becomes an adult. On the other hand, her mother will teach her to be just another entitled person who thinks the world should be handed to her on a platter.\n\nWhat this comes down to is that, you would be buying the car & computer with your own money, so you can put conditions on it if you want to.

That is good parenting.", "NTA\n\nThis is actually a pretty decent way to build responsibility and encourage your daughter to earn things. This is exactly what being an adult requires. Why not learn more in a safe environment.", "There is way too much missing information here. For starters, it's odd that you don't categorize her art as an activity. So it's not that you want her to something, anything, you want her to be doing different things from what she is doing.\n\nAnd it's a pretty safe bet you don't actually know what she is doing; very likely a lot of that time you think is 'texting' is actually spent on artistic endeavors she doesn't feel comfortable sharing with you. If she's resisting you taking her free time away that hard, that means she's doing something she values with it that she doesn't want taken away. It's possible she's just wasting time doing nothing, but it's also really, really, REALLY common that in conflicts like this one, the parent who is fussing is simply not understanding the value of what the child is pursuing rather than her not pursuing anything at all.", "I wish someone would have offered teenage me a car if I walked the dogs every morning. HA. It would have sounded like a bargain to me! Hell I'd do that now if someone wanted to buy me a car! \ud83e\udd23", "I'm not trying to start anything, but it's only bribery if Op would be giving his daughter the computer and / or the car before she has done the activities he's given her the option to do.

But I agree that Op should look into that there may be something else going on with his daughter like burnout or depression.", "All humans need exercise whether they particularly enjoy it or not. They also have to practice social skills. This is a foundational time in her life for building healthy habits. There's no requirement for her to be outside or even be doing cardio.

After 5 hikes?  Or 3 months in a club?\n\nEither way, I don't think it's a good long-term idea b/c I wouldn't want a transactional relationship with the child when other things may be going on.  Also, what if the younger brothers expect a car b/c they are in a club?  It's just probably not the best path to go down, and could create other problems.  \n\nI also know a 40-yo whose rich parents didn't like his fiancee... b/c they are racist and she's of a diff race.  They told him if he 'wanted his inheritance\" he needed to find someone \"better suited.\"  While I get this dad is trying to motivate, she isn't actually doing anything wrong (or that can be explained by other things)  and the dynamics may get weird.\n\nI generally agree with the mom's perspective, and I prefer gifts to be no strings attached.  I'd also be concerned that this may create resentment b/c it's too big of rewards for too little activity, and a computer is legitimately a school tool.", "She is clearly social if she has friends and is texting them. She's a teenager. Her metabolism is fast enough that not exercising right now isn't gonna make much of a difference unless she already has health issues. And I doubt OP wouldn't tell us if that were the case.\n\nHe is specifically using the term she is \"not doing anything\" while glossing over her art skills. Clearly she is doing _soemthing_ but OP doesn't value it. Makes me wonder what else OP isn't valuing. Maybe she likes book, or games. And OP doesn't think those are hobbies worth doing. \n\n It's not gonna build healthy habits if you hate doing it. What is OP doing to make the activity fun? Why can't he figure out something he can help her through. I don't see him suggesting they go for a walk together and have a bonding moment. \n\nSetting your own goals for something you hate is setting someone up to fail and then blaming the person for the inevitable failure. You can ask me to set as many hiking goals I like, end of the day I hate hiking. Im not gonna do it.", "I went through a lot of these goal setting and rewards earnings transactions as you called them growing because of being autistic and my parents took a parenting through my wrap around services at the time. So speaking from my experience, and I know it may not exactly line up with this, using it as a reference helps me explain what it's meant to be used for.\n\n You are correct in saying that the daughter is doing nothing wrong. It may just be that all she wants to do is watch Netflix, and if that's all she wants to do, she's free to do that.  But I think that as a parent, Op wants more for his daughter than to be holed up in her room secluded from everyone and the world.  So when she said that she wanted a computer for her art and a car because she's reaching driving age.  Op thought that he could get her those things, but wanted to also add almost like a responsibility that would come with receiving those items if that makes sense. That's where setting achievable goals would come in. And those would be for example, be she would have to walk the dog in the morning twice a week for 3 months and if she could follow through with that she would get her computer.  It would give a sense of responsibility and completion when finished.\n\nI don't know if this explanation helped or not", "I made the mistake of letting my 16yo son hibernate this last summer (essentially do nothing but sleep in, play video games, stay up late and repeat) without me intervening to force some activity, and he easily gained 30 lbs in 3 months. Very hard to control his eating when he does it at night when we are asleep. So teenagers metabolism work that way because they are active. And I offered multiple times to do things with him or have him go on my walks. \n\nThankfully with school started back up he is hanging out with friends and going to the gym, but I wished I had done more like OP is trying to do to get him active.", "I agree that it's not the best way to spend time, but there are many reasons she could be doing it.  Teenagers are weird, and it isn't indicative of a person whose life is off-track.  \n\nBut really, it is a HUGE reward for a small thing (join a club = get a car??), and I wouldn't want to set that precedent with this child or want that expectation in my family/for the other kids.\n\nA better reward might just be something that is of a smaller scale. If she likes art, sure, art stuff.", "And what do you think you would have accomplished except straining your relationship? Let the kid hibernate. He has precious little time left. Clearly he is back to being healthy once school started back up. Do you really think he would have been more likely to do something he disliked if you pestered him more?\n\nYou did a very good thing bonding with him, he will remember this time. I wish you would recognize what your kid needs instead of going with trends. As a 28 year old I cherish the times my mom let me sleep in and just rest. We both snack at night and we bonded over it.I work out now because unfortunately I'm nearing 30 and I can feel myself getting rusty. And your son is already doing better than I did at his age. I genuinely don't know what you're complaining about.", "It's not really about the scale or the precedent because as much as parents want to treat their children equally, they really can't because they are two different individuals. So it's about discussing expectations and what they believe will be an equal amount of work for reward.  If that helps", "Honestly my biggest issue is he has a pretty hefty weight problem now that I watched happen in slow motion over the summer. And just a simple change of routine to get a little bit of activity would have kept it at bay. \n\nAnd now he is depressed because of it.", "A car is a very unequal thing, unless you plan to buy all children a car.

Maybe you need a walk to burn some of that unnecessary aggression off", "Does he have health issues apart from being past the societal standard weight? Cholesterol, High BP, mobility issues? That's what I meant with teenage metabolism. And quite frankly by now we know BMI is a shit metric. If your son is otherwise healthy, I do not see your problem.

At this point it feels like you are grasping at straws. \n\nAnd like I said, OP does not mention any health issues for his daughter. We don't even know if she's obese. So yeah, your situations are distinct", "Lol. I\u2019m quite aware of what \u201cdistinct\u201d means although perhaps you were confused and intended another word. Nice try at deflecting by stating I have \u201cunnecessary aggression\u201d for having the temerity to present an opposing view.  The entire point that the OP is clearly going for is the daughter to move her body. That is not the same as being structured around her sedentary hobbies. It\u2019s quite the opposite and just as obviously by intent. Again, incentive. Again, she can choose not to agree."]}
