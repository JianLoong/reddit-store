It's also not uncommon for brides to choose someone other than their biological father to walk them down the aisle, whether it's a stepfather, uncle, grandfather, or another male relative.  \nWhile your stepfather may feel like he has earned the right to walk you down the aisle, ultimately it's your decision as the bride. You should choose someone who you feel comfortable with and who you want to have by your side on your wedding day. It's not fair for your stepfather or anyone else to try to pressure you into making a different choice.  \nIt's important to remember that you're not choosing between your stepfather and your brother. Your stepfather will still have an important role in the wedding, and you can find other ways to honor him and show your appreciation for everything he's done for you over the years.  \nOverall, I think you should follow your heart and choose the person who you feel is the best fit to walk you down the aisle.

I'm not trying to replace her. She's her own person, and I'm me. Dave has seemed to forget this. He may feel threatened, not by you, but by your father and his role in your mother's life.\n\nYou are not in the wrong. This isn't about who did more, or who earned the right. It's about who you desire. You desire Mike. But Dave did raise you. He gave you a home, spent money, and loved you.

My father is dead, however. I can't dismiss the hole he's left in my life. I'd like to honor him and his memory as I begin the next step in my life. All of you will be there as I celebrate.

If all Dave can do when he's confronted with the reminders of your mother's history is try to erase them, he wasn't making decisions or attempting to parent you from a healthy state of mind. There may be room for a good talk with your mother, and with your brother, so you can make it clear to them all what your decision is and get it to stick.", "NTA, your wedding!  Dave\u2019s just showing that he\u2019s still an ass", "Mike sounds a misogynistic, self-centered man with zero understanding of the boundaries you\u2019ve clearly set. And he has raised your younger brothers to be just like him. You\u2019re mother needs to grow a backbone and stand up for you or keep her mouth shut.", "Seriously. You just don't say something like that when talking about someone's dead parent. He's a jerk.", "That's not enough. She needed to defend you when he tried to insist that he was your father and she needs to shut this \"more of a dad than your bio dad\" bullshit DOWN.\n\nIt's tough and I'm sorry you're facing it.  You don't deserve to have someone like Dave in your life, nevermind your wedding.\n\nA family therapist may help you navigate this if you want to try.", "I hope OP sees this very mature, clear and measured response. \n\nJust the right amount of \"I'm not bending because you're angry. I'm also my own woman making my own choices. Thank you for everything but please support me in a way that I want on my day\"", "Walk down the aisle with whomever brings you the most joy!! Not Daves choice or your mothers.  NTA.", "If you have to tell someone that you've \"earned\" the right to walk them down the aisle, you almost certainly have not.   \n\n\nNTA.", "NTA You mom just wants to appease her husband. This is your day and it should be about what you want.", "NTA. I feel like choosing who walks a bride down the aisle is a good litmus test for who deserves to walk the bride down the aisle. Someone deserving, when finding out they\u2019re not chosen, while they may be hurt, would be understanding and kind towards the bride about not being chosen. Meanwhile, someone who gets angry and yells at the bride is clearly undeserving. So your step dad\u2019s reaction clearly confirms your decision to not have him walk you down the aisle. Your brother has been a positive male role model in your life and has known you since you have been born. And he is your father\u2019s son and having him walk you down the aisle is the next best thing to having your father there. You\u2019re honoring your father\u2019s memory by having your brother be there.", "Why are people so entitled to believe they can push their agendas on others just to keep the peace. I say its your wedding and as long as you are not being some bridezilla monster running roughshod over everyone in your path  you can do what you want. Hell my daughter had her brother walk her down the aisle and her bio dad and stepdad were both in attendance. AND no one said boo about it because it was what she wanted. Do what you feel is right and don't let others put their burdens on you. Your mom should be standing up for you not trying to bend you to her husbands will and I am truly sorry she is not.", "NTA Your wedding, your decision.", "I wouldn't want Dave walking me down the aisle for that \"more a dad to me than my 'bio' dad\" comment alone. NTA", "OMG! Completely NTA! Your wedding, your choice. He \u201cearned\u201d the right? Hmph What an entitled butthole. I\u2019m glad your brother will be there for you! No room for Negative Nancy\u2019s for you and future husband\u2019s special day!", "This is YOUR wedding, one of the most important events in YOUR life we're talking about here... you shouldn't be doing anything for anyone else's sake here, OP. If Mom can't grasp that, I'm sorry to tell you she's never going to prioritize you and she's pretty much as bad as the rest \ud83d\ude15. NTA."]}
