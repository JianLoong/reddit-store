It's also not uncommon for brides to choose someone other than their biological father to walk them down the aisle, whether it's a stepfather, uncle, grandfather, or another male relative.  \nWhile your stepfather may feel like he has earned the right to walk you down the aisle, ultimately it's your decision as the bride. You should choose someone who you feel comfortable with and who you want to have by your side on your wedding day. It's not fair for your stepfather or anyone else to try to pressure you into making a different choice.  \nIt's important to remember that you're not choosing between your stepfather and your brother. Your stepfather will still have an important role in the wedding, and you can find other ways to honor him and show your appreciation for everything he's done for you over the years.  \nOverall, I think you should follow your heart and choose the person who you feel is the best fit to walk you down the aisle. Your wedding day is about celebrating your love and the people who have supported you throughout your life, and you should surround yourself with those who make you feel happy and loved.", "Your decision\nNta\n\nAnd being pushy is funny, Dave can learn boundaries.either he accepts his role or will not be there.\nHis jealousy is not your problem", "NTA. I'm a stepparent, like Dave. I've done a bulk of the mothering, especially to the youngest of my stepchildren. But as a parent I know that I'm not in a competition. It's about you, the kids, and your well-being. I know that, like Dave, I've physically and emotionally done more than my kid's \"bio\" mom, and so what? I can't replace her. I'm not trying to replace her. She's her own person, and I'm me. Dave has seemed to forget this. He may feel threatened, not by you, but by your father and his role in your mother's life.\n\nYou are not in the wrong. This isn't about who did more, or who earned the right. It's about who you desire. You desire Mike. But Dave did raise you. He gave you a home, spent money, and loved you. It would help his peace of mind to give him an explanation. \"It's not anything personal against you. It's that every little girl dreams about her father walking her down the aisle. My father is dead, however. I can't dismiss the hole he's left in my life. I'd like to honor him and his memory as I begin the next step in my life. All of you will be there as I celebrate. You will be in places of honor. But the only way I can honor Dad is by having one of his family members walk me down the aisle, like he would have done if he were still alive. I hope you understand.\"\n\nCongratulations on your wedding and have a lovely new life!", "NTA. That comment about being around more than your 'bio dad' was below the belt. It's not like your dad was a deadbeat who couldn't be bothered to pay child support or visit you once a month. He fricking DIED! You want Mike to walk you down the aisle because he stepped up after your dad died, and having him there would be like having your dad there. There is nothing wrong with that.\n\nTell Dave and his sons to back off. You can even throw your reply to someone else's comments in Dave's face. You could've had a close relationship with him, but his own actions have pushed you away.\n\nThe only thing I will say is be prepared for him to chuck a temper tantrum and say he won't attend the wedding because you won't walk him down the aisle, and he may push your mother to not attend either. He sounds the type.", "NTA.   \nNo one has \u2018rights\u2019 anymore. This isn\u2019t medieval times and there isn\u2019t a bride price or a \u2018transference of ownership\u2019 of the brood mare anymore.   \nNow it\u2019s about honouring the person who has supported and loved you, and sharing the journey down a symbolic path as you join into a new family, carrying that support to your new family.   \nMike sounds perfect.   \nDave would also be perfect. Maybe both can walk you down if it doesn\u2019t cause drama/solves drama. But Mike is a wonderful nod to your life long relationship with him.", "NTA  Keep standing up for yourself, have the wedding you want.

Congratulations on your marriage.", "NTA. This is your wedding and you feel much closer to Mike than to your stepdad.\n\nDave hasn't \"earned\" the right to walk you down the aisle (such a dumb thing to say) and the fact that he said that at all makes me think that he cares more about what other people will think about him not being chosen, and less about your relationship with him. A step-dad who truly loved and respected you would recognize why you asked Mike, and would support your decision (even if holding down some hurt feelings inside).
