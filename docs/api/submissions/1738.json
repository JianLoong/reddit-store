Protect your daughter at all costs.", "Who the hell insults an innocent baby...Also, there is nothing wrong with having a child at 27 as long as you felt you were ready and capable to take care of a child.  Regardless, you are NTA, especially since this is her son's idea about the letter (and to clarify he is also NTA).  If she wants to act like a child, she should be treated as such.", "NTA, your MIL sounds awful and she does need to apologize, but in person, to you", "NTA. \n\nAlso, if you haven\u2019t already, I recommend joining and posting in r/justnomil Lots of solidarity over there. \n\nYour MIL might need more of a conversation than just the directive to try apologizing again\u2026 although the petty part of me does very much appreciate the irony of asking her to use the letter format like she had your husband do as a child \ud83d\ude02 \n\nI would try a facetime convo with the three of you, or just between husband and her, in which it is explained why her statements were hurtful and why her apology did not give you any sense of security that she understands why what she said is hurtful, and that you do not feel confident that the digs won\u2019t continue. \n\nShe\u2019ll probably apologize again, but this time you or husband have to make it clear that there is zero tolerance for those kind of comments and you will distance or remove yourselves entirely from the relationship if she cannot respect that. \n\nAlternatively, you could just tell her it\u2019s the letter or nothing \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f And still tell her it will be zero tolerance going forward. Good luck, OP!", "NTA - I don't think you are one for wanting a genuine apology. I mean my husband's grandma sent me an email saying that she wanted her great-grandchildren to have red hair like her grandson. As if there were any control in that. But my husband is the same grandson she emotionally and verbally abused his whole childhood. So I flat-out told her that my child's hair color should not be a concern at all, she should be wishing for them to be happy and healthy, not caring about features. I didn't get an apology or an amended statement. She passed without having met either one too.  \n\n\nMaking off-hand, hurtful statements is a good way to have regrets later in life. And while I don't think \"I wish you had waited till you were older\" is a hurtful statement per say, I guess it would depend on the emotional tone behind it. But the other ones are. Wanting her first grandchild to be a boy, could show that she has a gender bias or sexist behavior that will impact how your child develops a relationship with her and what it will impact her emotionally, mentally, and socially. \"Isn't she a bit chubby\", is a very ignorant statement to make about a 4-month-old (really about any child, because of the emotional and mental health impacts that it could have). But children don't shed their baby fat until elementary school. A chubby baby isn't necessarily an unhealthily fat baby unless the pediatrician says so. Chubby for a baby, is healthy.  \n\n\nSo, maybe your MIL needs to be told very directly that her quick blurted thoughts hurt and to maybe think before she speaks. That she needs to know words have consequences, and that while you love her, you won't allow her to hurt your children with her thoughtless words. It's not about you treating her like a child, although this kind of behavior is childish, as in children say things without thinking, and if you haven't learned better or refuse to learn better then you'll be treated like one. This is about making sure you protect your child, and you are actually giving her preferred beneficial treatment, because if this were a friend or acquaintance, you probably would have cut them out of your life without giving them the chance to redeem themselves.", "NTA seems like you are doing all the right things here.", "NTA- I would just tell her that if she doesn't like being treated like a child, then perhaps she should stop acting like one.", "Nta. But you will be waiting a long time if you want a genuine apology. People like her are incapable of sincere introspection therefore adjust your expectations accordingly because she will say some shit again and again\u2026 \n\nIf that means going no-contact, go no contact. Low contact is also an option. Expect her to be shitty and keep her at a serious distance.", "NTA\nIt's your kid you decide who you allow to meet her, you are on your rights to not let her.", "NTA - she's right, you're treating her like a child (but she deserves it).  Your kid, your rules.", "It sounds like you are using your kid as a behavior /bargaining chip which is gross. You don't mention in any way that you are trying to protect your child or that you think MIL is harmful. You don't even know how she would behave around her granddaughter. I get that what she said is completely out of line, but you should have clearly stated that, explained why and what would be acceptable going forward. This whole making her dance on a string so-to-speak seems more like a power play than protection for your kid. Esh", "NTA \nSeems like she was just disappointed slightly and maybe she wanted a boy to recreate the illusion of her having Gerald.

Worried you were too young, also, not mean, just thoughtless. And she has been there for you your entire life.

This is a case of you making her jump through hoops to see your daughter.  the MIL is 100% right in that you are treating her like a child.
