There have been GFs for both of them, most of them did not like that I was a stripper, but I got along with some of them.\n\n3 months ago B asked to move in his GF of 6 months, we agreed as long as she agreed to the \"contract\" and we split the expenses on 4.

Her opportunity to negotiate any part of the established contract was before/when she was moving in, not once she moved in after already agreeing to them. You and A agreed to her moving in on the assumption she\u2019d follow the contract. If she wanted to disagree with it or propose changes, she should\u2019ve given you and A the opportunity to weight in or say no before she moved in", "NTA. The fact the gf only started having problems with your job once you were pushing back on her complaints is weird here. The new person should be trying to fit in, not making waves.", "Dear gf,\n The fact of the matter is you are not on the lease and we can evict you at anytime. If you do not like the agreement we have, you are free to leave ANYTIME. Perhaps you should stop being entitled, and start being grateful for the fact that we are ALLOWING you to live here.\n\nSigned,\nThe actual leaseholders.", "NTA - you had an agreement. They want to break the agreement? They need to renegotiate it. Sound like they were trying to push their luck, good on you for not giving them an inch cos God knows they would have taken the mile.", "NTA. I think it's pretty clear they f****d around and found out.", "NTA, let them take their medicine. You compromise is more than fair I would have suggested she leave if she was unhappy with the preexisting arrangement. For this is not the final chapter of her causing drama.", "NTA. Your lease is for that room specifically, its not something she can arbitrarily change, just like I cannot tell my neighbour that we should switch houses because I like theirs better. She also doesn\u2019t get to come in and make changes to an agreement that pre-existed her and that she agreed to as a condition of her moving in. Sounds to me like she tried to throw her weight around and it backfired on her, thats entirely a her problem not your problem.", "Nope, definitely NTA. B was good with all of it before his GF came in complaining. They want to complain, the two of them can do their shopping and whatnot. Sucks to be them!", "NTA. Everything was running smoothly until she showed up and started trying to change everything and complaining about everything. Stupid games, stupid prizes. Of course when their agreement becomes shittier they try to backtrack. Sucks to be them I guess.", "You packed them 3 meals a day\u2026and they had the audacity?? As someone with stripper friends, she picked the wrong personality to fight lolololol\n\nNTA, I\u2019d literally worship a roommate like you.", "NTA", "NTA.  Maybe they shouldn\u2019t agree to things they have no intention of abiding by.  Like what was the alternative?  You and A just take care of everything?  Also, it\u2019s YOUR bathroom.  If GF doesn\u2019t like it then she can leave.", "NTA.   Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.  She wanted to take over and wasn't even part of the original agreement, then tried to force changes without talking it over with everyone else.  And then he started AGREEING to it.  Nope.  Consequences.", "NTA. Your job is nobodies business. I actually like your roommate agreement. Well thought out and makes any desputes easy to settle. The GF is clearly a spunge and has no say anyway.\n\nI like how you handled the situation. One concern though. If they don't get back into the agreement. Won't they just spite you and make a mess of the common areas?", "NTA\n\nTheir loss. They should move out to their own apartment together.\n\nThey knew what the agreement originally was, this was just run of the mill bullying from his girlfriend. \n\nYou have no obligation to return to the old agreement because they are unhappy with the outcome.", "NTA.\n\nI would happily clean common areas in exchange for someone doing meal planning/prep and cooking.\n\nB and his GF had **no** idea how sweet of an agreement they were in.\n\nI think you\u2019re fine not letting them back into the agreement.\n\nIf you **do** let them back in, I think they need to make some concessions. Like maybe they have to pay 75% of the streaming services for a year, or they pick up 66% of groceries for a set time period.\n\nThey need to experience the consequences of their choices.", "NTA. Can I say Gf probably judges you harshly for the work you do and so may be more aggressive towards you? Or expects you to be more passive and a victim?\n\nIt sounds as if this was a great situation that she broke up.", "NTA.\n\nIt's entirely up to you and A to decide if you want to let B back into the old contract or not.\n\nB's GF sounds like a toxic drama llama who wants everything her way. IMO you're better off leaving her out of the agreement. B is collateral damage. He earned his consequences first by not stopping her and then by agreeing with her.\n\nThe one wrinkle I see is that you were exempt from cleaning common areas as a result of shopping and cooking. If you aren't shopping or cleaning for B and GF, it seems like you should pick up a share of common area duties.", "NTA. Don't poke the bear if you don't want to get bit.", "NTA. I would kill for a roommate that did my shopping and cooking in exchange for some cleaning. I didn\u2019t even know this was an available option!", "You shopped AND cooked for her and she was at all ungrateful?!? What!?! All she had to do was work with two other people to keep the common areas clean? What?!? I can't even imagine a better deal.\n\nYou are so NTA. \n\nI guess since you aren't cooking or shopping for her, she no longer needs to clean. So, be prepared for the place to start being messy. Probably best if you could get them both to leave.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nThey wanted changes and you were ok \ud83e\udd13\n\nNow let them enjoy it", "NTA. You pack their lunches??? Can I be your roommate? Lol grocery shopping and making lunches is my least favorite chore for some reason", "NTA they wanted you to do your share and theirs too.", "NTA - do not cook one single molecule of food for her. \n\nMay I ask what OF is?", "NTA - She shouldn't have moved in if she didn't like the arrangement and trying to shame you for your job is out of order. Your roommate should have stuck up for you and he didn't so they deserve what they got.", "NTA. You've been very fair and clear with them. They've got to learn their lesson... Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "NTA - you could go back to the original agreement and just keep it simple and reinforced. There are no changes unless somebody wants to move out.", "NTA.  Re-opening negotiations doesn't automatically result in the dissatisfied winning a better deal.  Sometimes they end up with less than they had, instead.  It was a valuable lesson for B & GF to learn.", "NTA, the GF is an asshole for trying to change a dynamic that works and complaining about your job, which doesn't affect her at all, and B sucks for taking her side when he knows that the current arrangement works.", "So they didn't like the old deal, now they don't like the new deal, maybe they need a new new deal in a different place....", "They sound like a headache especially her", "NTA.  You made the agreement, she thought she could have what she wanted after the fact and now is salty.   It's pretty clear that she only backed down because you didn't let her get away with it.  If you let it go, it'll only get worse.   Give her the boot!", "NTA. She tried to push you out of your room, take control of everything and all of a sudden that\u2019s not working for her. At the end of the lease it is time for them to go.

Landlord would still need to give proper notice to all tenants to terminate tenancy. That includes the new girlfriend if she has lived there long enough.", "But would have to do so legally (eviction). Doesnt matter if she is on the lease or not.

A lot of parents still really instill \"what will the neighbors think\". At least in my area.", "For those of us who are conflict-avoidant and chronic people pleasers, it's not obvious. Even if it were, our fight-or-flight mechanisms kick in at the tiniest hint of conflict so to press on like this isn't just uncomfortable, it's debilitating.\n\nConsider yourself very lucky that you are able to freely speak your mind without fear of others hating you and don't mind conflict. It's a blessing. But others aren't stupid simply because they feel or behave in a way that you can't possibly understand or relate to.", "I agree, it\u2019s hard.
