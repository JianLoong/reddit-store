I take the kids to school and daycare and my wife picks them up.\n\nI noticed some transactions from our shared bank account that were unusual and I asked my wife about it. She explained that she's been taking our youngest to ballet lessons in the afternoons after daycare once a week, and each lesson is \u00a330.\n\nI got annoyed because my wife didn't discuss this with me and \u00a330 a week is quite a bit of money. I asked her to stop taking her to the lessons because we can't afford them but suggested she look for cheaper activities, preferably something both of our children could enjoy. My wife protested and said that our youngest really enjoys the ballet, she called me an asshole and said that I'm depriving my daughter of something that could help her future, and that we can find a way to afford them.\n\nI called the lessons a waste of money and told my wife that we are partners and she shouldn't spend large amounts without discussing it, especially when we don't have a lot as it is.\n\nMy wife started crying and said that something that makes our child happy isn't a waste of money. She went into our room and slammed the door and that was the end of that conversation.\n\nSince then, my wife hasn't really been speaking to me and I wonder if I was the AH here.\n\nEdit to add because everyone keeps asking: the childcare for our 2 year old is covered as a benefit from my job, so we aren't paying for it.", "created_utc": 1667240042, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yijwht/aita_for_calling_my_daughters_ballet_lessons_a/", "score": 3886, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You can't waste money on silly things like ballets for 2 year olds when you don't have money to throw. Either she realises it or she gets her own family to help her spoil her kids when they can't. \n\nI wonder what she would say to the 6 year old if she ever asked to do afterschool activities and there weren't enough money for it. Hers would actually be useful to her. Not ballet for toddlers.\n\nYou can take the kid to the local libraries where they have playgroups. You can also get into other mom groups or go to soft plays. You can also SPEND TIME WITH YOUR BLOODY CHILD SINCE THAT IS BASICALLY HAVE TO DO.\n\nSorry but I find it super weird that after the kid is at nursery she also needs even more time to herself by taking the kid to an extra curricular.\nHow much can't you stand your own spawn if you need to reduce the time you spend with it? \n\nThis is my opinion personally and I might be wrong and prejudiced.

If that's a full time job, as in you aren't getting a minute's peace while looking after them, your day has probably been more intensive and exhausting than your partner working at a desk all day. If you've had time while the kids amuse themselves, sure, you should be doing housework. I know my mum didn't work at all after my younger brother was born, she had five days a week free of childcare when we were all in school so it's be ridiculous if she weren't responsible for most of the chores. But when we were younger, I can imagine having postnatal depression and two under two means her days were actually way harder than my dad in his traditional employment. Also, it's important to remember that studies show relationships are happier and healthier when jobs are shared, not divided. The long and the short of it should really be that you're in a partnership, you both want what's best for every member of your family, so even if you're out working 9-5, if you come back and have energy, help your partner out. Similarly, if they're a stay at home parent, they shouldn't be taking the p*ss with chores because they know you'll help out when home, they should be pulling their weight in terms of work and effort in the relationship and in taking care of the family/home (be that directly or financially).", "Because being a STAHP is taking care of the kids. Cleaning up the house is the responsibility of BOTH adults in the relationship.", "It\u2019s usually in regards to the dads who come home, plop on the couch, ignore the kids and expect dinner ready", "I think the idea is both parents should be working a similar amount and getting a similar amount of free time to feel fair. That is going to look very different with different numbers of kids at different ages.\n\nIf you had a SAHP and two kids in school, I'd imagine it would be on you to do all the chores, cooking, errands, etc during that time, and then both parents could have some time to relax in the evening. I'd imagine in that situation you'd still have extra time too? Or say you had older kids for the day but they were on summer break, still not needing the same level of care and attention all day as they can toilet themselves, be trusted not to eat every penny they find, etc.\n\nIf you are SAHP of a newborn baby and a toddler (I was this during COVID) it's exhausting and was a lot harder for me then working. I found it hard to get chores done with a young baby and toddler and the fact that I never got enough sleep (breastfed) so was constantly tired. My husband would come home and start making dinner (while I nursed the baby) and we'd do things like laundry on weekend (we were in apartment, laundry was not in unit) on weekends. Basically, I'd feel like I was super tired, had no breaks, and the housework still wasn't all done. So if husband came home and I was just dying for him to take the kids for a bit so I could have a single break, and he never did, I' have been very depressed.", "Where did I say that the parent that works out of the household should be doing half of the housework? I didn\u2019t say that at all. \nBut yes, when that parent is home all remaining childcare and household duties are 50/50 because if it were a single parent household or a household where both parents worked outside of the home, they\u2019d still have childcare and housework when they got home. \nA good majority of stuff can be done by the stay at home parent, but that doesn\u2019t mean everything should be put off on them.", "> I\u2019m sorry but that\u2019s fair why should the working parent have to come home and do half the work? While the other parent is home all day?\n\nLook at it this way. Working Parent starts work at 8, comes home at 4:30. That's their working day done. Meanwhile let's say Stay At Home Parent starts their chores at 8 - dishes, cleaning, meal prep, tending to children, etc. and then it's 4:30. Is Working Parent the only one allowed to have an end to their work day? Yes, there's still things to be done, dishes, putting kids to bed, taking out the bins. If both people split up after work house duties, it will go much more quickly, and then they will have time to do something nice together, even if it's just watching telly for a couple of hours.", "Because they live there too. They are a SAHP not a 1950 house wife. Should she have a drink poured, a roast in the oven and his pipe and slippers at the ready?\nOP is NTA but this side argument, wow.", "Because the SAHP job is childcare. They are staying home to raise the kid, so their 9-5 is keeping the child enriched, educated, clean, aged, and cleaned up after. That includes socialisation, medical stuff, appointments. Anything on top of that is shared household responsibilities. Obviously that metric can change depending on the child\u2019s age (if they aren\u2019t home) and or needs (if your SAHP is taking care of a child with a serious medical condition then they probably have LESS time to do stuff). In the end the majority of household tasks tends to fall on women generally, even if they are working too, but it is still unfair.", "I feel like this just waking up some days mate, but on average laundry in general isn't worthy of that descriptor.  (Hope you're okay btw)", "Thats exactly it and I've never thought of it like that but it's totally true. You just come across that it needs to now go on the next stage... in between daily tasks", "You're acting like I don't work a 13hr shift job but manage to do all the same including the grocery shop, without making out its some superhuman feat. It isn't underestimating, its reality. Adding a once a week shop/fortnightly doesn't change my view. And she's from the UK, you can do it online in 15 minutes.", "YES. I don\u2019t understand everyone acting like working parents don\u2019t have to do these same things, after work and on weekends!!", "Yeah we get a break because there's no SAHPs in our family. The chore fairy must sort it out", "You've never worked retail I assume", "lmao \u2018retail\u2019 \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "I don't have an alternative. I am sad because this is what she feels she has to do. She shouldn't not have to do this and it should be recognised as wrong to ask a human to do this. Whatever culture she's in should be helping their single moms more than they are. That should make everyone angry. Where is her support?"]}
