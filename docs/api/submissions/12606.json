She's now avoiding speaking to me. I've gotten some concerned messages off our family and even our parents asking what happened and saying that Kelly told them I refused to loan her money and argued with her.\n\nI'm very frustrated and I think Kelly is being an asshole, although as sisters we've often not gotten along.

I doubt you\u2019d feel the same about helping Kelly.", "NTA. Don't loan to your sisters again. One cant keep her mouth shut, the other wants a handout even if she's not struggling.\n\nYou were really nice for helping out Megan but like you said kelly doesnt even NEED the money and she's asking for way bigger. I'm going to bet youre going to have a hard time taking back your money too.\n\nTo make matters worse, she even got mad at you for wanting to have an interest and payback date, telling you youre acting high and mighty.\n\nWell, getting a loan for you is a privilege not a right. She shouldnt be loaned money after she disrespected you like that.\n\nIf your other relatives are saying youre an AH for not loaning money indefinitely without interest to Kelly, then just dont give anyone a  loan at all.", "NTA\n\nYou told her your conditions for loaning the money, she refused - if she really planned on giving you back the money she would have accepted because she surely cannot get that additional money from a bank.\n\nAnd if she would have stopped there, she wouldn't have been TA. Instead she involved the rest of the family in this to make you reconsider.\n\nYou are not her ATM, you can loan money to whomever you want, you can change the conditions in which you loan money every single time.\n\nEdit to add: OP probably keeps the money in a bank, not under the mattress - so by loaning that much money OP will most likely lose interest and possibly pay a penalty fee if there's a term on the deposit.\n\nThat's why it seemed fair to charge sister 2 interest. 8000 euros it's almost $10k if i am not mistaken.", "NTA. They're both your sisters, but these are not similar situations.\n\nYou are not required to loan any money to anyone. You are not \"selfish\" for keeping your own money.\n\nEven though the loan to Megan \"worked out\" in the sense that she paid it back, she *did* break a stipulation and \"blabbed\" about it.\n\nIt's good advice not to lend money to family or friends.\n\nIn the US (and I know you said Euros and almost certainly aren't in the States), it would be illegal to borrow additional money for a home purchase to get around mortgage limitations. Kelly and her husband can wait and save.\n\nFinally, Kelly's attitude is a complete deal-breaker. Say no, and if any family come to you about it, tell the truth and tell them that they're perfectly free to lend money to Kelly if they want.", "NTA\n\n1.

And helping 1 person feed their kids is very different from helping a person who has a house buy another house. Also, you've done a great job saving money, congratulations!!!", "NTA. Your sister was in a difficult situation that could not be anticipated and you stepped up to help. That is a really great gesture from you. The second sister just seems to think she is entitled to your money.\nIf they can't come with 8000 from saving for a few months how do they expect to pay it back with a larger home and so more fees and spendings.\nI don't know where you live but I know moving is never cheap nor easy.\nIt's legitimate to ask for interests because if you have this money you can place it and have it generate interests for you.", "NTA Oh, no no no. Here\u2019s a tip I learned the hard way: if the bank won\u2019t lend someone money, YOU SHOULDN\u2019T, EITHER. \n\nI\u2019m not sure why Kelly doesn\u2019t recognize the difference between 2k & 8k or the difference between helping someone out of a bind and funding an extravagance. I\u2019m also betting that Kelly has no intention of paying you back in a few short months. If she could do that, she would have already saved up the money. I suspect you\u2019d have a hard time getting any of the money back from Kelly.\n\nThose family members who think you\u2019re so mean for not loaning Kelly money?

Kelly and her husband could always wait a few more years or until they have enough to buy a new house. How does she know the bank will reject their application if they haven't sent it in yet?", "NTA. You don\u2019t have to loan them any money at all and she is asking for much more than Megan . Plus it\u2019s not an emergency", "NTA but this is Megan's mess to clean up. What an asshole she is.", "NTA.

Plus, your sister even said it herself, she is aware that she isn't entitled to your money and how much, which speaks for itself. \n\n\nIt goes without saying that this is your income and giving it to someone else, regardless of who they are, is a commitment of trust, and especially with an amount that high I wouldn't expect it to come back to you anytime soon, considering they are trying to move into a new home whereas Megan was more established, she just needed a hand, and she didn't need an amount that couldn't be unreasonably paid within a decent time allotment.\n\n\nThat said, this boils down to the fact that this is your money, this is how you feel it would be appropriate to handle, and interest can help deal with the added pressure of not having that money available to you right now, on top of incentivizing your sister to pay it back. Yes, she may be family, but if her requests for the mortgage is being rejected, the fact you're even willing to do so is a far kinder gesture than most people would.", "NTA. If a bank doesn't feel they can afford the loan, and the bank would at least have collateral and interest to reassure them, you'd be a fool to extend them an unsecured loan that they clearly can't afford. Either make it a gift or else say no outright. As a creditor, you take a backseat to the mortgage holder. All the people giving you grief now are the same ones who'd be outraged if you tried to collect on the un-repaid loan because \"your poor struggling sister might lose the house because of you -- are you going to make her whole family homeless?\" Count on it that sob story being the excuse for shafting you. She needs to do what everyone else does: delay gratification, and save up.\n\nShe already owns a house. You don't. Her idea of who is the more privileged person here is distorted. You have every right to prioritize putting 100% of your savings toward buying yourself a house, and you do not owe her anything just because you showed someone else kindness during a bad situation.\n\nHowever, Kelly needs to learn to keep her mouth shut. So both of your sisters are AH for how they handled themselves.", "NTA\n\nNo one is entitled to your money. This is not even an emergency they\u2019re having, they\u2019re just looking for help with a down payment. They can wait. You\u2019re not a bank. \n\nHave you talked to Megan after she told your sister about the loan?

She is out of line. NTA.", "Nta\n\n\nBut don't give a dime to either sister. Megan betrayed your trust. She just lost a helpful resource. \n\n\n\nAnd Kelly is the biggest jerk. Save yourself from future problems and stop loaning money at all.", "NTA. \n\nYour money, your rules.\nAlso, you may want to do a third option: loan her 2k interest free, and the rest with interest. She must reimburse first the 2k interest free before reimbursing the rest (you could do the other way around, but maybe you want to be petty based on her attitude). \n\nMention as well that loaning her the money, a substantial amount, will delay YOUR purchase of a house.", "Info: what was the interest you were charging?", "Amount notwithstanding, the inconsistent treatment by you between your two siblings feels wrong. However it really depends on the circumstances. How quickly will this loan be paid back? If it's less than a year like the Megan situation then I wouldn't bother charging interest. Longer than that then it will start to add up and you'd be within your rights.\n\nI think Kelly is right to point out the inconsistency and asking for equal treatment, at the same time she comes across acting like she's entitled to your money. So that cancels out any goodwill she had until then.\n\nI'm gonna cop out and say INFO and will give a verdict after you explain the length of the loan Kelly wants to take out.", "Loan the same amount (2k).", "Technically NTA, you can lend money and set the repayment terms as you see fit, but it is kind of an AH move to charge interest one sister but not the other.\n\nIt really sounds like you\u2019re mad Megan blabbed and are putting obstacles in the way so you won\u2019t have to lend the money to Kelly.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to lend her money, stop with the passive-aggressive crap and just tell her no.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
