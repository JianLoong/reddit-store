Even in a low-yield savings account that only earns 0.4% interest per year, that's still good money OP could be earning in interest. \n  \nI'm assuming that OP would charge her interest on the loan that is close to what she would have earned in her savings account.\n  \nBut even if she charged twice that, where else can anyone get a loan of that size for less than 1% interest? Where do I sign for that? I would definitely take that deal.", "I think OP is NTA and has zero obligation to lend the money.\n\nHowever, I think there is some confusion about the process. I bought three houses up to now (I sold the house I had before purchasing the next one, so I only own a house). \n\nThe thing is, at least in Portugal, banks don't lend money for your downpayment, mostly after the 2008 housing market crisis. Some banks might do it as a personal loan, with much higher interest rates, but it's quite rare. That's because during that crisis a lot of people returned their houses to the banks. After all, they couldn't afford the mortgage. So now, the banks want to reduce their risk by having you pay at least 10% of the house's value beforehand. If you ask for money for your downpayment, you have a higher chance to have your application denied.\n\nI think that's where Kelly is coming from. However, she is not entitled to OP's money, even if she was planning to pay it or not. Both of the two OP's sisters are AHs. Meghan because she snitched about the loan she got, even after OP asked her to stay silent about it and Kelly for bargaining the loan. Not only that, but she even sent her flying monkeys after OP.\n\nHonestly, I wouldn't loan money to any of them, anymore.", "Usually, the equity from the sale of one house gets rolled into the down payment for the next house.", "*to get around the mortgage limitations*\n\nIt's true that a separate loan isn't illegal if it's disclosed; the purpose / nondisclosure is the fraudulent part."]}
