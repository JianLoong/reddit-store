My older sister and I have high-earning careers, while my wife's family is all working class. \n\nIn the last few months, my wife has told me that she feels uncomfortable about the fact that we get nicer christmas presents for our nephews on my side of the family. We've done this is the past because my sister spends a lot of money on our daughters during the holidays. I think my wife's concerns are extremely reasonable, and I'm happy to make that change. However, this got complicated when discussing what to do next. \n\nMy wife's priorities:\n\n1. All of our nieces and nephews get christmas presents roughly of the same value\n2. We don't spend more money on presents for her side of the family because she doesn't want to embarrass her siblings or make us look snotty\n3. My wife doesn't want to tell my family that we're cutting back on Christmas presents because of reasons 1 and 2.\n\nMy priorities:\n\n1. I absolutely will not allow my older sister to spend more money on my kids than we do on hers (meaning I have to have a conversation with her about this)\n\nI have this conversation with my sister, saying that we're planning on cutting back this year. She immediately asks if we're having money problems. I say that we're worried about spoiling the kids. My sister then asks if our girls are have behavioral problems. I deny that too. Then, she immediately guesses what going on and asks if it's because of my wife's family. I deny that too. \n\nUnfortunately, my sister isn't an idiot. She immediately notes that if the girls aren't having behavioral issues, my excuse that I don't want to spoil them doesn't make sense. That means I lied, and she will just assume we're in financial trouble. Then, the next logical question is to ask, how does someone making that much money get into financial trouble (drugs, gambling, medical issues).\n\nAt that point, I wanted to nip that train of thought in the bud. I confirm her third guess (which she was clearly already thinking to be the most likely) and say that we don't want to spend different amounts of money on the neices and nephews. I want to be clear that I made everything out to be a joint decision. However, my sister immediately was like \"Oh, that makes sense. \\[Wife\\] wanted to make this change\". I deny that and say that is was a joint decision. My sister says and I quote: \"If this was a joint decision, you wouldn't have lied about your reasons at the beginning of this conversation. Somebody is embarrassed, and I don't think it's you\". \n\nMy wife is now mad at me because my sister thinks my wife is driving these changes. However, we both agree that this is preferable than my entire family thinking we're in financial trouble. I don't know how I could have gotten out of this one unscathed, so I don't think this is my fault. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1685057944, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13rx3jd/aita_for_telling_my_sister_that_my_wife_wants_us/", "score": 55, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Telling your sister you are only going to be spending $XX amount on gifts for each niece and nephew this year is being honest.  The WHY part is no business of your sisters.  And really wouldnt matter how you said if, if your sister assumes any changes come from your wife, then she'd think that anyway.", ">Somebody is embarrassed, and I don't think it's you\"\n\nTo which the response is \"No, it was a mutual decision but I didn't want to say it.\"\n\nThis is the 4D chess of Christmas present considerations.  So many moving parts.\n\nNTA though because your sister really needs to take the foot off the gas pedal.  You're scaling back on presents, she doesn't need to verbally water-board you for the reason.  \"Is it drugs?  Is it gambling\"  At that point your sister just looks like an AH that's trolling.\n\nBest you can do is make a ccorrection in no un-certain terms that this is a family decision and your sister needs to slow her roll.\n\nAlso, when it comes to kids, budget gets scrubbed after a certain point.  There's only so many Polly Pockets out there.  One or two is fine.  No child needs their Uncle buying them 20 Nintendo Switch games, 1 is enough, maybe 2 if you want.  You can gold plate the wrapping but that makes no difference to a child.", "NTA\n\nthe fact that your sister makes this into a big deal, doesn't mean that you have too - she was way out of line with that questioning and now she can believe whatever she wants\n\nwhat matters is that your wife and you follow what you believe is right, end of story", "Spend what you want it's not a contest. Just because you can Doesn't mean you must.", "INFO why did you want to hide the actual reason for your and your wife\u2019s decision? It is an eminently reasonable one.", "You didn't need to explain why the decision was made.  You just needed to repeat that you made the decision.  Decision explanations are not required, even if they continual ask you.  Let their imaginations run wild.  That is their problem.  You've now made a problem for your wife.\n\nI don't think you should gift nieces or nephews based upon what their parents give your kids.  You give at the level you think appropriate and are comfortable with.  I know some well off folks give the cheapest (yes, quality) gifts while others less fortunate give great gifts.  And great gifts don't need to cost a lot.  Great gifts can be time or experiences, not necessarily the latest gaming system or iphone.", "All of this makes sense and honestly I think there\u2019s NAH. You were absolutely right that you needed to have an actual conversation with your sister about it, and I don\u2019t even really fault her for sniffing out your prevarication (though she needs to back off gracefully a bit sooner IMO). I don\u2019t really think your wife is an AH here either although I guess it depends on how mad she is at you - she let embarrassment cloud her judgment a bit but there wasn\u2019t any real point in trying to hide the reasoning and it makes you all look embarrassed when you needn\u2019t be. It would have been a better play to just agree with your sister that you all noticed the difference in approach between your various sets of niblings and decided together to even it up.", "NTA \n\nThis is one of those situations where there was no way you could ever win.", "NTA why should you lie that it was your decision or even a mutual one when it wasn't?", "NTA - If your wife was worried about the messaging, she should have joined the conversation.", "My family did a gift exchange until my brother said \u201cHey, let\u2019s all give each other the gift of keeping our own $50?\u201d And the tradition ended", "I don\u2019t know, OP, you might want to modify this sentiment of yours, maybe: \u201cUnfortunately, my sister isn't an idiot.\u201d", "NTA. Your sister sounds nosy af. Not wanting to spoil your kids regardless of their current behavior should be enough of an explanation. Or maybe you just would rather the money be put towards something else like savings! It\u2019s really nobody\u2019s business. \n\nIt only makes sense to spend roughly the same amount on family members, because your kids very quickly will notice that aunt and uncle on mom\u2019s side don\u2019t give as nice of gifts as aunt and uncle on dad\u2019s side. \n\nGifts can be so tricky, but they shouldnt be! I have a weird situation with gift giving between my in-laws as well. I resigned from my job recently due to a relocation of my husband\u2019s job (military) so our income was reduced significantly. We are also expecting a baby. My husbands sibling and their spouse are also expecting a baby, and they both have good jobs. I would have assumed that they would realize with our household income being cut in half, that we couldn\u2019t afford as nice of gifts as before, but that didn\u2019t stop my SIL from having a full blown temper tantrum when she thought we didn\u2019t \u201cspend enough\u201d on her birthday gift. The whole thing has really rubbed me the wrong way, and my husband and I have decided we just aren\u2019t going to do gifts unless we are spending the actual holiday with the family member.", "NTA. Your wife was asking too much. \n\nAlso, if she wants to spend equally but not embarrass her siblings, could the extra money not be set aside as a little nest egg for the niblings on her side? So you still get them $40 gifts but if you spend $300 on your sister's kids, that's $260 going in an account earmarked for the kids on your wife's side that they can use towards education/vocational training, first car, etc. If the parents are working-class, that money would probably be very helpful later on.", "NTA, except that you should have emphasized to your sister that this wasn't an issue of embarrassment at all - it's about fairness, ethics, and making sure all the kids in the next generation know they are equally valued, rather than favoring some over the others.", "NTA, but since when do you owe your sister or anyone an explanation?!?! That\u2019s straight up ridiculous. Moreover, you are giving her fodder. IMO the less said the better. It\u2019s all about boundaries and setting your limits (meaning you and your wife). \nIf you fall into the trap of explaining your decisions to your sister and family then you deserve whatever hell comes from it.", "NTA.  Your finances are none of her business.", "NTA\n\n Since this was your wife's idea, she should've been the one to discuss it with your sister. And with the kids and explain why they are getting less gifts. Boy, would they love her family for this...", "To be honest, I think YTA.\n\nYour sister was incredibly nosy and judgemental, but you enabled her by allowing this conversation to progress like that. Just a simple, 'This is how much we're planning to spend on the nibbling this year' was all it took. You shouldn't have gone any further than that, and the way you describe the conversation makes it very clear your wife instigated this choice. You should have shut down all of your sister's questions instead of answering them in the way you did. She had no right to any further information, so why did you provide any?\n\nThe way your sister jumped straight to blaming your wife tells me a lot about the dynamics of your family's attitude towards your wife, and your lacklustre response suggests that you don't defend your wife from their snobby attitude nearly enough.\n\nThis is your side of the family. Its your job to manage their relationships to your wife and children. And you're not doing a good job when your sister feels this comfortable to make such passive aggressive, snide comments about your wife.\n\nEdit: Do I think the wife was 100% right here? I guess not. But if I were her, with a husband who routinely spends more on his side of the family than mine, passively blames me for us trying to not overspend during a cost of living crisis, and allows his family to insult and blame me, I'd be pretty pissed off too.", "Your sister is smart. The most important thing about giving a present is that it makes the recipient (and in this case their associated family group) happy.\n\nIn your situation both family groups want presents of a value in line with their financial situation - your wife\u2019s family expect cheaper \u201cless posh\u201d presents, while your sisters family prefer more extravagant gifts in line with their disposable income. Nothing wrong with that. I\u2019m sure even your wife\u2019s family\u2019s gifts would seem excessive to some very poor families. Everything is relative. \n\nSo it\u2019s only your wife\u2019s 1st priority I disagree with. It is pointless and will only serve to ensure one family group is unhappy/uncomfortable with their presents and at the same time increase tension between you and your wife. You should be aiming for equal happiness, not equal spend. They\u2019re not the same thing at all. \n\nIt\u2019s about giving people what they want. And both family groups want something different. As long as you can afford it, then keep each group happy and give them presents commensurate with their expectations. That\u2019s the art of present giving.", "ESH: \"My wife is now mad at me because my sister thinks my wife is driving these changes. \" well, that's because she's not an idiot. Even from your story it's obvious that this is about your wife not wanting to feel embarrassed over her family.  It was her urging that caused this 'mutual decision' to pre-emptively save her family face.    Your sister and 90% of the people in this thread understand you're just covering for your wife's insecurities.  \n\n\nWhich I mean... is fine?  Kinda sucks for your sister because that makes her Christmas less fun but not being able to give great gifts is a very first world problem.  \n\n\nESH 'cause you did your insecure wife's dirty work, got called out on it, and now seem to be confused as to why.", "I like your sister.
