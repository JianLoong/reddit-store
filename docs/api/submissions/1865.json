Unbelievable.", "NTA but your stepson sure is. The offer you're providing is basically \"here is this thing I'm offering to pay for you and a +1\". If you were to pay for the 3 partners to go then by the stepson's logic you should be giving the other kids the difference in what you'd have spent on the stepson. See how ridiculous that sounds when it's turned around?\n\nOf course if you were to then give the other kids money to make up the difference the stepson would want money too because it's \"not fair\" by his messed up logic.", "NTA it boils down to money and you can only pay for one other person that\u2019s life", "NTA.

They just have to make their own way (also similar to a wedding).", "NTA. Giving each child a plus-one is more than generous. Your stepson wanting the money you would have spent is ridiculous - your offer was for family to help you celebrate your vow renewal in front of family. He's chosen not to participate in this.

Tell your wife that son should be focused on celebrating with the family and he doesn\u2019t deserve any money for acting entitled.", "NTA. I get where he is coming from. He has multiple important people in his life and he feels like you are penalising him for living differently to the norm.\n\nThe truth is that it's not about his lifestyle, it's about what you can afford. I'm sure it would hurt your wife, but he might chose not to come if his entire family isn't invited, the same way a family might not come to a wedding if you invited one child and left the other two out. And that doesn't make him the AH either. It's his insistence that you pay that does.\n\nBut you can't insist he comes. Just like a wedding you are *inviting* him. His options are to go with your stipulations, find some way to pay for his other partners, or not to go. If you try to make him go because you are paying you would be the AH.", "NTA as i was reading and seeing you were paying dor the other childrens SO i was all ready to call you the AH but he has 3 SO !!!\n\nYou are not unreasonable at all to say you only pay for one +1 for each\n\nTo ask about the money is grossly entitled, i wouldnt give him a dime, he can join with his +1 or stay home and get nothing\n\nDoes your wife cater to his unreasonable demands often?", "NTA you are being reasonable he is not. Ask you wife to put up the money for him.", "NTA  \n\n\nYou aren't judging his family but giving the same offer to each child.   \n\n\nThis would be a more interesting question if one of your daughters had 3 children and you were paying for her whole family to attend, but not his whole family.", "NTA you have treated all the children equally.

Your stepson is now an adult and he's allowed to make his own decisions.", "NTA\n\nOP: I want to invite you for a nice dinner, you can bring a guest. \n\nSon: no, i will not come if i can't bring 3 extra ppl, and now give me the money you would have spent on me and one guest. \n\nLol", "At first I thought that the OP is a homophobic person because of the title but after reading the post? My gosh! OP you're NTA! You're actually a generous man.", "INFO: If one of your other kids had two children, would you pay for the +3 or ask them to leave the kids with a sitter?\n\nAs a poly person I can sort of see both sides of this. He\u2019s being an entitled A H for sure, but if everyone gets to bring their whole family and he doesn\u2019t, that\u2019s some A H behavior from you. If it\u2019s just two tickets per kid, then it\u2019s not about his family, it\u2019s about what you can afford.", "I think.... if your kid is poly then his partners are his family just like your other kids and their partners. Maybe you should've accounted for that in your budget. You may not mean to exclude him in this way  but that's still the end result. Sorry but I have to say YTA.\n\nOther than that his behaviour is weird asking for the money. So he's also an a-hole\n\nSo I say ESH.", "I think.... if your kid is poly then his partners are his family too just like your other kids and their partners.\n\n Imagine someone offering your family of 5 a trip but you and your wife can only bring one kid. That obviously can't work.\n\nI think you should've accounted for that in your budget. You may not mean to exclude him in this way but that's still the end result. You still end up treating his orientation like a silly little inconsequential thing or an inconvenience. So sorry but I have to say YTA.\n\nOther than that his behaviour is weird asking for the money. I get that he probably needs it but why manipulate like this\ud83d\ude2d So he's also an a-hole\n\nSo I say ESH.", "Its a party celebrating op's marriage,  so son is not the focus even. Does he understand what an anniversary party is? \n\nIts all about the couple  on their anniversary.  How does hurting the focus of the celebration respect that?\n\nI'd be tempted  if I was op to send a group mail, that this was last party op would cover travel costs for. The inflation  combined with wanting to concentrate on retirement funds are needed more. So adults going forward pay for their own hotels and tickets.", "There was an AITA once where a couple offered to take their 8 year old daughter's best friend along with them on a trip to Disney at their expense and the parents of that daughter said no, their daughter could not go on the trip, but could the couple give them the money that they would have spent on her? People are unbelievable.", "He is also free to attend his family event by himself if he's worried about cost or leaving someone out. There have been times my husband and I split the attendance/child care between us. It's not a big deal. Sometimes it wasn't appropriate for our whole troop to go, or financially reasonable.", "Also a low blow for trying to make this about his orientation/lifestyle choices\u2026. Polyamorousness? Whatever, It\u2019s the last desperate move of someone not getting their way - to attempt to shame their way in. NTA", "I wanna see him packing the 2 turtle doves...and the partridge, to make it the plus three\ud83d\ude02. Do birds like the beach? Will seagulls attack? Sorry...too funny.", "Same, I was expecting to see the stepson treated differently than the OP\u2019s child and the couple\u2019s child. Not the case at all. Definitely NTA. \n\nAnother comment suggested he could come by himself if he didn\u2019t want to choose among his partners. Good solution. It\u2019s not about him, it\u2019s about his mom and stepdad. Asking for the equivalent in cash was selfish.", "The thing is his entire family **is** invited.  OP just isn't footing the bill for more than 2 people  \n\n\nETA NTA", "Given he demanded the cash instead, it just seems like guilt manipulation for the eventual grift rather than being honestly offended.", "He's 26", "My only grandchild is staying home with his grandmother.", "OP says that his only grandchild is not coming.", "If he was in a poly relationship with ten people would I be expected to pay for a +10?", "YTA", "Now that I think about it.... the hotel room would still cost the same because his polycule probably wouldn't mind sleeping together. You already bought 2 tickets so the real cost of including all his partners is 2 more tickets and a 2 more meals. I get youre not made if money so maybe tell them to pay for some of their meals. \n\nNow I'm not saying tickets are cheap, but I think it is worth it to properly including your child in a family event. Making him choose one is actually kind of problematic \ud83d\udc40", "The guilt trip and insisting on money when this is supposed to be a personal relationship deal. Entitlement doesn't even come close to summarizing the situation.\n\nOP, you sound like a good person, and I hope you can come to some agreement with your life partner over this. That's the bigger issue.", "Paying for three extra people is a lot. He's an entitled asshole for asking for the money, especially when it's a vow renewal when the purpose is similar to a wedding.", "He doesn't see an anniversary. He sees a free vacation in Hawaii and nothing else.", "That's a good point. If he can't pick one of the three partners, going solo is a viable option so he could still go on the vacation.", "Can you imagine a redo of Pirhanna with Seagulls, call it \"Gulls\"\n\nthanks for the LOL at work :p", "Is [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yqcrij/aita_for_not_paying_for_my_stepsons_boyfriends_to/ivnvq8p/) you accidentally on your main? I just wanted to mention it in case you wanted to delete it.", "You know your first one counts Y T A not E S H. You don't even know how long they've been together and they're dynamic. An additional 3 is a lot of money especially when they are welcome to come but she's just not paying.", "That's my best job! You're welcome!!", "Holy crap. Thanks.", "Np. :)"]}
