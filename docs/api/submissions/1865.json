He lives with a woman and two other men.  I love the kid and his love life is none of my business.  But he wants me to pay for all four of them to come.  \n\nI told him to pick one. I don't care if he brings his girlfriend or a boyfriend. But he only get one extra guest.

He is acting like a spoiled brat. He was offered 2 tickets not cash. He can make a choice either go on vacation with 1 other person of his choice or not go. This is your anniversary celebration not his celebration. He gets nothing but the tickets. Congratulations and I hope you have a great time.", "NTA but the stepson is a seriously entitled asshole for first expecting more than a +1, and second for demanding the financial equivalent of a trip he turned down.", "NTA You saved up to do something great for your wife. He is trying to take the money but not come and celebrate with you guys.  He is the AH.", "Absolutely NTA. The sheer audacity of an adult man making a demand of his stepfather like this! The money is yours to do with as you please, he gets nothing you don\u2019t wish to gift. Your offer was fair and it\u2019s his own life choices that led to his broke lifestyle. Unbelievable.", "NTA but your stepson sure is. The offer you're providing is basically \"here is this thing I'm offering to pay for you and a +1\". If you were to pay for the 3 partners to go then by the stepson's logic you should be giving the other kids the difference in what you'd have spent on the stepson. See how ridiculous that sounds when it's turned around?\n\nOf course if you were to then give the other kids money to make up the difference the stepson would want money too because it's \"not fair\" by his messed up logic.", "NTA it boils down to money and you can only pay for one other person that\u2019s life", "NTA. Your offer was more than fair. You're paying for your other children's SOs, you offered to pay for one of your son's as well, and it's not like the others weren't invited. Your stepson seems a bit greedy to be honest.", "NTA. Paying for three extra people is a lot. He's an entitled asshole for asking for the money, especially when it's a vow renewal when the purpose is similar to a wedding. You're on a budget and you said all his partners are welcome. They just have to make their own way (also similar to a wedding).", "NTA. Giving each child a plus-one is more than generous. Your stepson wanting the money you would have spent is ridiculous - your offer was for family to help you celebrate your vow renewal in front of family. He's chosen not to participate in this. He doesn't get cash as a bonus prize.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re being unreasonable at all.", "NTA and wow your wife is so wrong, your son is not entitled (NOTICE THE WORD) to your money, he is an adult and can go or not. Everyone got a +1 he is just a entitled kid at heart. \n\nHe can not go and neither can his +3 crowd.  It's your money you saved up for a special event, take the extra you save and do a helicopter flight over a volcano or something that actually makes you happy. \n\nAs far as his lifestyle this has nothing to do with it and it's gas lighting to even bring it into this context, it could be 2 guys and a girl, 3 guys, 2 turtle doves, and it wouldn't matter, +1 is +1.", "NTA.\n\nEveryone got a +1 and if he demands to get a +3 and getting mad when he is not he is entitled.\n\nAlso he is entitled about your money which he somehow wants to claim as well.\n\nHe can get a +1 like everyone else and if the other 2 can't manage to come well... not your problem.", "Nta. You gave each kid a +1guest. Just because he decided to be with 3 other people, doesn't mean that his entitled to have them all. You don't owe anything to him.", "NTA \n\nHe gets a plus one just like everyone else.", "NTA. A plus-one is standard for weddings and vow renewals. He gets a plus one just like everyone else.", "NTA - You've made it fair. 2 tickets for each. And no, you don't get the cash if you choose not to go.", "NTA. He's taking the piss", "NTA,  You don't have to subsidize his life in any way.", "NTA. It's your anniversary and he wants 40% of the expenses to be for him and his partners? Hard pass.", "NTA. You're right - it's not what you saved for. He's had an invitation for himself and one other so he should be grateful. He has no idea how the world works at all. Does he really think that he can turn down every invitation he gets and ask for the cash value instead?", "NTA\n\nYour stepson is living his life how he chooses to, and that\u2019s great, but he doesn\u2019t get to choose how you spend your money. What you offered was fair, but your stepsons response was incredibly entitled. Your stepson then demanding cash, oh my word. Rude.", "NTA- imagine he is living with 10 people... would you need to pay for all 10. You do you however money is finite", "NTA. You told him everyone was invited but you could only afford to pay for two people, so they would need to figure out how to get the other two people there. He jumped right to \u201cyou don\u2019t respect my lifestyle.\u201d And then to demand you give him the money instead of attending?? Outrageous. Tell your wife that son should be focused on celebrating with the family and he doesn\u2019t deserve any money for acting entitled.", "NTA. I get where he is coming from. He has multiple important people in his life and he feels like you are penalising him for living differently to the norm.\n\nThe truth is that it's not about his lifestyle, it's about what you can afford. I'm sure it would hurt your wife, but he might chose not to come if his entire family isn't invited, the same way a family might not come to a wedding if you invited one child and left the other two out. And that doesn't make him the AH either. It's his insistence that you pay that does.\n\nBut you can't insist he comes. Just like a wedding you are *inviting* him. His options are to go with your stipulations, find some way to pay for his other partners, or not to go. If you try to make him go because you are paying you would be the AH.", "NTA as i was reading and seeing you were paying dor the other childrens SO i was all ready to call you the AH but he has 3 SO !!!\n\nYou are not unreasonable at all to say you only pay for one +1 for each\n\nTo ask about the money is grossly entitled, i wouldnt give him a dime, he can join with his +1 or stay home and get nothing\n\nDoes your wife cater to his unreasonable demands often?", "NTA you are being reasonable he is not. Ask you wife to put up the money for him.", "NTA  \n\n\nYou aren't judging his family but giving the same offer to each child.   \n\n\nThis would be a more interesting question if one of your daughters had 3 children and you were paying for her whole family to attend, but not his whole family.", "NTA you have treated all the children equally. If he can\u2019t choose one plus one then he either comes alone or his group (sure there\u2019s a proper word) will have to find the cash between the 4 of them.\n\nHe is being an entitled brat to ask for the cash, you are offering a trip, he doesn\u2019t get to turn it down and make demands.", "Your stepson is a little weasel. Do not give him money. He can go with a friend, or not. \n\nYour wife is wrong. \n\nBut tell her that you will spend the ticket and hotel money on some college courses, so he can work towards affording the life he wishes he was leading.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The sheer entitlement of telling you to take/pay for all 3 partners and himself is insane. I can\u2019t wrap my head around the audacity of this man. Its mind boggling. Anyone else would be singing your praises and thanking you a zillion times for offering them a vacation like this, but he demands more? Then he asks for the money for the trip that he turned down.
