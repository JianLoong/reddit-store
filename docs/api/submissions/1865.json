Unbelievable.", "NTA but your stepson sure is. The offer you're providing is basically \"here is this thing I'm offering to pay for you and a +1\". If you were to pay for the 3 partners to go then by the stepson's logic you should be giving the other kids the difference in what you'd have spent on the stepson. See how ridiculous that sounds when it's turned around?\n\nOf course if you were to then give the other kids money to make up the difference the stepson would want money too because it's \"not fair\" by his messed up logic.", "NTA it boils down to money and you can only pay for one other person that\u2019s life", "NTA.

They just have to make their own way (also similar to a wedding).", "NTA. Giving each child a plus-one is more than generous. Your stepson wanting the money you would have spent is ridiculous - your offer was for family to help you celebrate your vow renewal in front of family. He's chosen not to participate in this.

Tell your wife that son should be focused on celebrating with the family and he doesn\u2019t deserve any money for acting entitled.", "NTA. I get where he is coming from. He has multiple important people in his life and he feels like you are penalising him for living differently to the norm.\n\nThe truth is that it's not about his lifestyle, it's about what you can afford. I'm sure it would hurt your wife, but he might chose not to come if his entire family isn't invited, the same way a family might not come to a wedding if you invited one child and left the other two out. And that doesn't make him the AH either. It's his insistence that you pay that does.\n\nBut you can't insist he comes. Just like a wedding you are *inviting* him. His options are to go with your stipulations, find some way to pay for his other partners, or not to go. If you try to make him go because you are paying you would be the AH.", "NTA as i was reading and seeing you were paying dor the other childrens SO i was all ready to call you the AH but he has 3 SO !!!\n\nYou are not unreasonable at all to say you only pay for one +1 for each\n\nTo ask about the money is grossly entitled, i wouldnt give him a dime, he can join with his +1 or stay home and get nothing\n\nDoes your wife cater to his unreasonable demands often?", "NTA you are being reasonable he is not. Ask you wife to put up the money for him.", "NTA  \n\n\nYou aren't judging his family but giving the same offer to each child.   \n\n\nThis would be a more interesting question if one of your daughters had 3 children and you were paying for her whole family to attend, but not his whole family.", "NTA you have treated all the children equally.

Your stepson is poly and has multiple important partners. The concept of a plus one comes from a culture of monogamous relationships and doesn't really fit his situation anymore. So to him, you're sort of asking him to fit into this cookie cutter mold that doesn't really fit him. I think you should have talked to him or discussed it with the family beforehand. He's an AH for asking for the cash.", "I am polyamorous. As are several of my friends. We would all side eye so hard if someone tried to pull a free plus three and we\u2019ve all experienced actual drama and judgement for our relationships.\n\nWe would not as polyamorous people indulge this for a second because polyam is not being part of a cult. Within it there are individual relationships so in my throuple I have a one on one with both my BF and GF, they have a one on one as spouses and then our \u2018fourth\u2019 is the relationship as three people. This is crucial so you don\u2019t become a codependent three headed borg and can do stuff with each partner, all together or as a solo human where applicable. They don\u2019t all go to work together now do they?\n\nPolyam can have hierarchies and dilemmas about plus ones and equity but generally it is good poly etiquette not to ask for more resources than a traditional couple. So if someome we know well offers us a plus two that is hugely appreciated but also means for say a wedding, we bring a larger gift or extra bottle of wine because we are more than a couple and must balance that out. We also often remind people that they should not feel obligated to invite us all if they don\u2019t know us all, can\u2019t afford it or don\u2019t want the questions. If people start saying stuff like \u2018I\u2019m not inviting you because it\u2019s disgusting\u2019 no one is RVSPing anyway :) And it has happened\u2026\n\nA lot of polyam people are big on breaking down the mononormative culture where romantic coupledom is given highest status. Personally I don\u2019t really give a shit about the \u2018political\u2019 statement side. I like the fact it gets me out of stuff like meeting my in laws after eight years but I always chuckle how often people are poly and \u2018subversive\u2019 and then want \u2018couple perks\u2019 just the same. If the meal deal is two burgers and two fries and you want four portions of fries, you have to cover the two extra whether you are single, Mike Pence level monogamist, polyam or party sub level of guest etiquette.\n\nPolyamory is not a protected status. Any LGBTQ+ within polyam can suffer discrimination for their sexuality but the relationship style itself is not the same. If you were saying he couldn\u2019t bring a BF while his other poly partners stay home, that would be about being LBGTQ+ not poly. It might feel like an orientation to some but it\u2019s not classed as one and either way you get to set guest lists as hosts. Plus ones, no ring no bring, again unless you are going after a protected class the invitee can think you are an AH and you can still say \u2018ticket admits one plus guest meeting these T&Cs\u2019 in any scenario.\n\nOh and btw I\u2019m also currently not working due to ill health and thus I have declined multiple invites due to not being able to afford it because get this: neither the host nor my other partners are obligated to cover my lifestyle especially luxuries. You cut your cloth accordingly. They will need a whole extra room or upgrade to a suite because hotel rooms and resorts are definitely going to \u2018judge his lifestyle\u2019 by insisting on room capacity according to contract and fire code. The polyam hotel in joke is rife. Even my broke ass haven\u2019t been on holiday for 15 years Gen X self has heard of it so I don\u2019t buy for a second none of the four of them haven\u2019t.\n\nNTA.

That's the same as all your other children and is generous.  There's nothing wrong with being poly but it's not reasonable to expect people to provide you with multiple plus ones to anything regardless of whether money is involved.  When money is involved it's just not practical for someone to pay for two extra sets of flights, a bigger hotel room and whatever else is included.  It's the same as anyone with a larger family situation.

But I don't think you understand how awkward and painful a position you're putting your stepson in by telling him to \"just pick one, I don't care which one\" of the people he loves. Especially as a guest for a wedding or vow renewal. The whole point of inviting guests to those is to mark inclusion in your family. You can tell your stepson all day long that you support him and accept his partners, but if you do not show support and acceptance by treating them like his partners, then your words don't actually mean a lot in the real world. \n\nIt's an AH move for your stepson to refuse to go and then ask for the cash you would have spent, since the point of you spending the money is to make memories and affirm family bonds. Him blowing up like this probably seems hugely disproportionate because you see this as a simple case of fair treatment: one guest for each kid. You mention feeling confused because you thought you were just being fair, but it's not really fair among your stepson's partners if one of them gets to go on this big romantic family-bonding trip to Hawaii and the others don't, right? They'll probably feel like your stepson is picking a favorite. \n\nThe thing is, restrictive plus-ones are just one of the many ways poly people are made to feel unwelcome and excluded from their families and the world. He's probably scared that you don't actually consider all his partners to be an important part of his life and future, the way you consider your daughters' boyfriends. Or that if he \"picks one\" to bring along, you and your family will consider that one to be the \"real partner\" with the others somehow being lesser or window-dressing, that you'll begin to bond with the partner he brings and continue consciously or unconsciously excluding the other ones. Also, being in Hawaii without someone you love is lonely! Especially on a trip to celebrate you and your wife's marriage. Even if he brings one of his partners, he'll probably still miss the others and have a hard time keeping up a happy front so as not to wreck the trip for you.", "YTA no sane poly person would want all their partners on one vacation so I think this is fiction.", "When he said the son demanded that he be paid for NOT going my jaw dropped to the floor.

There is also no way I can pay for so many extra people. So, you have a choice: enjoy a free vacation and be grateful that you were invited and we want you there, or stay home, but you won't be getting my money.

No, you shouldn't.

Coming up with a way to handle that is a part of maintaining that healthy relationship.\n\nOf course, if they were deciding to go on a vacation together, all four of them would go.

Either they can pick one of them (based on whatever criteria they want) to be the stepson's +1, or they can let him go by himself.\n\nI know his sense of entitlement is getting in the way of seeing this.  Maybe his partners' are thinking the same way. But like -- if one of them won 2 tickets to the movies, or a concert, or a dinner, they would have to make this same decision.  Can we pay for all 4 of us to go out?  No?  Then the choice is pick 2 who get to do it, or just, give up the tickets altogether.\n\nI'm particularly unimpressed with stepson immediately making this about \"you don't approve\".

It is mostly seniors who live there but they also have younger people living there as well since the City changed the rules.\n\nShe comes from another city and settled here years ago but our municipality who runs the building gave her a small room which she uses as a free boutique to help those in need (all private donations which she finds herself). It is her baby and she spent many hours with a bit of help sorting through donations of clothing, household items etc. A lot of work is involved here with very little help and strictly private donations.\n\nWhen people move into this building, they often arrive there with nothing but a few pieces of clothing and hardly anything else. Some come from the Mission as well and were found an apartment in this building after waiting for a long time on a list.\n\nShe does this on her own mostly and lets anyone in need from this building pick what they need (they are allowed two bags of clothing and a certain amount of household items depending on the need). With my help and a few private donours, she was also able to have a little food pantry to help out. It is not meant to replace the food bank but she normally will give out 5 food items to tide someone over until they get their monthly check (mostly disability or Old Age etc which is very low to start with). I contribute quite a bit of food to her pantry every month and she is extremely grateful. She also has a few other donours and this is all done through privately, without the help of government assistance.\n\nThis summer she told me that she was totally burned out. She needed a break and it was getting too much for her. I know that I was bringing two cartfull of really nice food items to her pretty much every month for quite a while and people were getting used to it (nicer items than the food bank I was told). She told me that most people really appreciated it but she started getting people knocking on her door demanding that she open the pantry because they needed something like \"gravy\" as they were making a pot roast. Others kept whining about the tuna not being in oil, asking for special requests like fancier coffee etc. It wasn't the majority but it was enough for her to put the brakes on this for a while as it royally pissed her off and really jaded her.\n\nAll she wanted was to close the pantry and the boutique for the summer to get a break and just rethink her strategy. Well, some people demanded that she continue and went and complained to the building management about it. Mind you, she was doing this out of the kindness of her heart with private donations and she was so burned out. Building management (city owned and ran) could not believe the gall of these people since she was volunteering her time etc. \n\nShe had told me that this had been going on for a while now. She was very depressed about it because it really got to her. She would give and give and it was never enough. Some people also stole food behind her back when she would be there to distribute it. For example, she would say one item per person when it came to coffee, and one man grabbed all the coffee. I would also buy treats with my donations as I feel that people deserve a treat and one guy grabbed all of the little cakes that I bought (they made him put it back because she was with her friend who was watching and he got caught). There was some people that were extremely greedy.\n\nSame thing for the clothing. She had to kick out several ladies who repeatdly were told not to take more than they should. They would hide items under their clothing to get more. It got a lot for her to monitor this because she is also a very non controntional person.\n\nIn September, I asked her if she wanted to continue with the pantry and she said that she did. I continue to contribute but it is not as much now because I also was quite taken back. She was also told by people that they didn't feel like going to the Food Bank located close by because it was too much trouble so they used this service instead which was not meant to be a food bank at all (a few items to tide people over is what it was meant for). They said what she gave was much nicer (probably my fault but I like to give nice food items.\n\nNow, because of those who ruined it for others, I give just basic food and less of it. She only gives to those who truly need it but sometimes it is hard to tell. \n\nI asked her once why she still does it and she says that there is far more people that are kind than those who abuse this help.
