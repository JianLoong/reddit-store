I am genuinely shocked. 99% of the time I see something about a sister/SIL/daughter and putting on clothing in the title it\u2019s an easy call OP is sexualizing someone for existing with a body and wanting to wear what feels comfortable. But honestly? No underwear with legs akimbo in the middle of the living room is a step too far even for Reddit. You are NTA, if your other sister thinks  your older sister is too stressed to be told to put panties on when in the living room why doesn\u2019t she take her in?", "NTA\n\nTell her that's part of the deal of her getting to stay there.  Put on clothes or leave.", "\u201cHouse Rule that we are going to make explicit. Everyone\u2018a genitals are fully covered in common areas, including when walking between areas.

OBVIOUSLY.", "NTA - you're uncomfortable with seeing that much of your sister, and fair enough everyone has preferences and boundaries. \n\nPersonally the t-shirt and underwear level of clothing sounds normal to me. \n\nTheoretically you should be able to sit down and have a convo about it. Along the lines of: in sister's home she should dress however she feels comfortable as that is her home, given that she's now in your home there's a little difference in what you and your husband are comfy with. And you ask that she respect you and your husband's comfort zone. \n\nGiven that you know she's most comfy with less clothing, hopefully you can find some middle ground that doesn't require her to wear a lot of clothing. I.e., a general request that all areas normally covered by a bikini / one piece bathing suit remain covered and you aren't fussed with how she does that vs telling her she has to be covered from neck to ankles.", "NTA\n\nIt's basic decency and you and your husband don't need to see that.  Your sister (23f) is welcome to take them in if she feels it would be too traumatizing for her sister to be asked to put on clothes.", "NTA. If someone wants to be a nudist, that is fair enough.

At what point will you choose your husband? At what point do you worry your husband feels judged by you by not wanting her there and unwelcome in his own home by being forced to put up with your sister, even after expressing his want that she not stay with you.  \"I don't think she is doing it on purpose\" she is certainly purposefully NOT trying to be a decent house guest.

It is a simple boundary.  This needs to be a hard boundary and the first time she doesn't do it she is out.  Tell her exactly that.  She should feel unwelcome.

She obviously has no respect for you or your husband and the fact that she's doing this so your husband can see all of her is just on another level. This type of behavior is toxic and can be seen as a way to get certain attention that you do not need interfering in your marriage. From the sounds of it, she has made poor decisions with her own male companions and maybe deep down she's hoping for yours.

Yeah, at my house, clothing is optional for adults. But even then, my kids aren't comfortable with that, so I dress when they are over.\n\nTell her to dress, or she can leave.

I take the bad guy role for my kids and wife.", "My husband and I were both very hesitant to have her move in. He was dead set against it at first because my sisters have a bad habit of taking advantage of me in anyway they can. He didn't want her to move in and think she was entitled to all of our things and we absolutely did not want to be free babysitters. We also didnt want her to move in and make it home, she needed to be actively working towards a new place for her and the kids. We both agreed it would be less traumatic for the kids to try and let her move in with firm boundaries in place. We even bought a board for our rules and expectations and had all the adults sit down to go over it before she moved in. We just didn't think to put how to dress on the board. I didn't even think about it, I didn't think it would be an issue", "> It would absolutely break my heart if she did that\n\nI get it.  I hear you.\n\nBut that's just her getting away with emotional blackmail to avoid following your rules. This is you and your husband's home.  This is either a dealbreaker, or it isn't.\n\nIt's a decision the two of you will have to make.  You can't wish and hope her nakedness away.", "Is she really so deranged that she would move to a shelter (where she will definitely be required to wear clothes and potentially pass drug screening) because she was asked to wear panties in the common rooms? Smdh.", "Pretty sure you can't walk around like that in a shelter either so I'm pretty sure you are safe. And if she is that mental then its better to rip of the band-aid quickly. Doing something like that over something so trivial and then dragging your kids with you is a good way of losing custody.", "Sometimes that's what's for the best. Once when my cousin was pregnant with her 3rd, she didn't have a place to go and no one had room for her and the kids. She went to a shelter and within a month or 2 they had helped her secure an apartment with rent that was based on her income.

My sisters still talk to the whole family, and I can see my mother's manipulation and brainwashing effect them in their adult lives to this day. It's like they act JUST like my mother sometimes.

If you don't believe what Im claiming, please look up what I'm typing to verify the information. It's only long because I'm trying to explain the seriousness of the situation.\n\nYour sister is committing a form of Noncontact Sexual Harassment and Sexual Abuse. Sexual harassment is exposing ones genitals or naked bodies to others without consent. It's Sexual Abuse because she's repeatedly doing it and she's exposing her genitalia around children. \n\nAny normal adult would 100% automatically know that your sister is wrong and would have an issue with her. Your sister is committing the definition of sexual abuse to children and you have a child. You'll have CPS at the door the moment one  of your sisters kindergarten aged children makes an inappropriate comment and the mandatory reporter teacher hears it. Anything sexual with children evolved automatically triggers worst case scenario policies. It doesn't matter what you did or the details. The policies are for the safety of the children.\n\nThe mere whisper of your sisters behavior will trigger a red alert CPS scenario because any normal person would automatically jump to that because the evidence is obvious. You would be grouped in with your sister because you would be considered as allowing that behavior. You will have your life upended and investigated to see if your daughter is a victim of alleged abuse or if it's worse then what was said. \n\nReally think about it. Think about how kindergartners talk and how they might talk about seeing the constant behavior your sister is doing. If you heard a child talk that way, where would your mind go? They'd have to know that information somehow. The circumstances of knowing that information have only ever been bad, so something bad must be happening.\n\nAgain, I'm sorry if long, but please look up what I'm typing if you doubt any of it. You'll face investigation even if you aren't guilty because the claim is real. It's not fake or from a false report. It's not like someone angry calling up and making up a lie that can be proven false.", "NTA. Strutting naked or in underwear around one\u2019s own house where they either live alone or with family members / a spouse who don\u2019t mind is one thing. But around a *sister*? No way!", "Akimbo Spice if she can sing Or Autotune", "If you had put, \"Cover your genitals in all common areas,\" on the board, she'd be doing something else completely absurd and unpredictable to push your boundaries and push your husband's even harder.\n\nShe knows you want to cave because 'her children will go to a shelter'. She's just going to keep messing with you and trying to mess up your marriage and drive people away from you until you stop giving in to her. You need to take care of your own child and side with your husband instead of playing toxic games with Ms. Pudenda."]}
