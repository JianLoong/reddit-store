My sister (29f) and her two daughters (both under 5) have come to live with us temporarily because my sisters boyfriend went to prison and she couldn't afford her apartment anymore.\nMy husband wanted to take in the kids but DID NOT want to take in my sister, after some negotiations and boundaries we decided to allow my sister here, because we didn't want the kids to lose both parents. \nHere's the problem, my sister doesn't wear clothes. She'll have a night slip on with no underwear sitting on my living room floor, legs open for the world. Or she just walks around in a t-shirt and underwear. My husband and I have both literally seen her vagina multiple times.\nI do not think my sister is doing this on \"purpose\". She has been like this my whole life. Back when I was 20, my sister and I moved in alone together and she acted like this, I didn't mind because it was just us girls but now it's uncomfortable. \nI was telling my other sister (23f) and she says I would be an asshole to call out my sister, she's stressed and depressed with everything in her life and I shouldn't make her feel judged/ unwelcomed. \nSo, AITA if I sit down and tell her to cover up?\n\nUpdate:\nI sat down with my sister after the kids went down and we talked for a little just catching up on where she's at in life and mentally. She's been here for 2 weeks and it's looking good for this new place she wants, only enough space for her and  the girls so hopefully she focuses on herself and her kids for a while. \n\nSome of you said she was doing this intentionally or as some sort of manipulation tactic and I can't know, I can't read her mind. But I did ask her what was up with her being indecent around us and the kids and why she would ever think that's appropriate. She started crying and immediately apologizing, she knew she flashed us a couple times, and she knew it was awkward, but nobody really brought it up so she tried to ignore it out of shame. \nBasically my sister doesn't have money for laundry, and she's been running out of clothes. We don't have a washer or dryer in our apartment and I thought she was doing her laundry because she'd take a basket full out of the house every week. She said she's only had enough money to wash one load for her kids and maybe throw in a few pairs of underwear for herself which don't last long. She's been rewearing night shirts at home and her work clothes for work. \nMy sister also just doesn't have the best \"sitting etiquette\" I guess is how you'd say it, I'm the same way, I sit with my legs sprawled open, but I'm always in pants.\n\nAnyway, we are going to wash my sisters clothes. We have more than enough laundry quarters in our mason jar to wash two or three loads for her. That should catch her up and she can get back on track with her laundry. \nWe did eventually laugh uncontrollably about how crusty she is. \n\nI'm playing it by ear now, just because I think the problem is going to be solved doesn't mean it will be. If that's the case she will just have to leave, I just hope she'll leave her kids until she finds somewhere stable.", "created_utc": 1693325016, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/164mgcy/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_needs_to_put_on/", "score": 296, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And you ask that she respect you and your husband's comfort zone. \n\nGiven that you know she's most comfy with less clothing, hopefully you can find some middle ground that doesn't require her to wear a lot of clothing. I.e., a general request that all areas normally covered by a bikini / one piece bathing suit remain covered and you aren't fussed with how she does that vs telling her she has to be covered from neck to ankles.", "NTA\n\nIt's basic decency and you and your husband don't need to see that.

He didn't want her to move in and think she was entitled to all of our things and we absolutely did not want to be free babysitters. We also didnt want her to move in and make it home, she needed to be actively working towards a new place for her and the kids. We both agreed it would be less traumatic for the kids to try and let her move in with firm boundaries in place.

It's only long because I'm trying to explain the seriousness of the situation.\n\nYour sister is committing a form of Noncontact Sexual Harassment and Sexual Abuse. Sexual harassment is exposing ones genitals or naked bodies to others without consent. It's Sexual Abuse because she's repeatedly doing it and she's exposing her genitalia around children. \n\nAny normal adult would 100% automatically know that your sister is wrong and would have an issue with her. Your sister is committing the definition of sexual abuse to children and you have a child. You'll have CPS at the door the moment one  of your sisters kindergarten aged children makes an inappropriate comment and the mandatory reporter teacher hears it. Anything sexual with children evolved automatically triggers worst case scenario policies. It doesn't matter what you did or the details. The policies are for the safety of the children.\n\nThe mere whisper of your sisters behavior will trigger a red alert CPS scenario because any normal person would automatically jump to that because the evidence is obvious. You would be grouped in with your sister because you would be considered as allowing that behavior. You will have your life upended and investigated to see if your daughter is a victim of alleged abuse or if it's worse then what was said. \n\nReally think about it. Think about how kindergartners talk and how they might talk about seeing the constant behavior your sister is doing. If you heard a child talk that way, where would your mind go? They'd have to know that information somehow. The circumstances of knowing that information have only ever been bad, so something bad must be happening.\n\nAgain, I'm sorry if long, but please look up what I'm typing if you doubt any of it.
