The 6 year old is day weaned? So you\u2019re still feeding him at night? That does seem a little old. Is there something going on here that feeds into their issues?\n\n2. You fed the 3 month old 8 times in 6 hours!?? What the hell. A 3 month old should be going 3 to 4 hours between feeds. I literally have a 3 month old. He\u2019s a snacker so he\u2019s often only 2 hours between, but even so. An average feed is between 15-25 minutes. So you spend between 2 hours and  3 and a half hours of the 6 hours feeding the youngest. That\u2019s insane. Are you sure you aren\u2019t putting him on the boob for your comfort and bonding rather than for him feeding?\n\n3. You\u2019re feeding the 2 year old as often as then 3 month old? I get sibling jealousy but surely you deal with that but making the fact he gets to eat real big boy food all exciting!? Not just feeding him more, that doesn\u2019t seem like a long term solution.\n\nYou\u2019re definitely N T A for feeding in public. Obviously. But I feel like there\u2019s loads missing from this that\u2019s making me think you are, in fact, the AH.", "Umm, your six year old is \u201cday-weaned\u201d? What does that mean? Are you nursing your six year old at night? Usually I would be on a nursing mothers side to feed whenever and wherever, even the two year old. But a \u201cday weaned\u201d six year gives me pause and makes me wonder if there is something you are leaving out.", "I feel like there is a lot of information missing here. \n\nA lot of other people have remarked on a few things but I can\u2019t put my finger on it. \n\n\u2014did this aversion to your breastfeeding start because you were nursing a school aged kid? I don\u2019t see any family naturally having a problem with it unless something happened they you\u2019re leaving out. \n\n\u2014if you know they\u2019re like this, why did you commit this many hours to them?\n\n\u2014did you commit to this many hours out with them because you knew you\u2019d get the opportunity to be smug about making them uncomfortable? \n\n\u2014by the timeline it sounds like you had a baby on the boob like over 80% of the day. \n\n\u2014weird jealousy and attachment issues going on with 2 of the 3.

Two yo children do not \u201cself regulate\u201d (again, per one of your comments).  Two year olds rarely know the meaning of self regulation. It\u2019s jealousy. \n- Have you considered that your infant is on the breast so much because your 2 yo is literally eating his food? I know the body produces what\u2019s needed for breastfeeding, but 8 times in 3 hours? No. \n\nYTA. You need to fully wean your 6 yo, as well as your 2 yo.

My partner & ex/oldests dad don't think I was an asshole so I'm mostly here to get others opinions.\n\nEssentially I have two sons I'm breastfeeding; toddler who just turned two and a three month old. I breastfeed both as is recommended. I have a six year old son too but he is day-weaned and thus not really a subject here lol.\n\nMy family has always been incredibly uncomfortable with it. With my first I wasn't even allowed to talk about nursing him. As the years have gone on and I had my second baby I became less tolerant to their bullshit.\n\nI would nurse my sons around them in my own home but would remove myself/cover up when out with them (places they couldn't \"escape\" so to speak).\n\nMy third is an unhappy baby. Generally detests the fact that he's alive. You know, normally infant things. \n\nHe is a picky nurser. He will not nurse with a cover on. He hates it. And I'm dealing with some toddler jealousy so he's being nursed as much as his brother, and he's a little big for a cover (will just take it off).\n\nSo, this past Sunday, when we had a little park trip, I didn't pack a cover. I sat on the bench and I fed my baby. I nursed the baby a lot more than the toddler (who was running around, lol) but I think over the day I nursed him three or four times and the baby about eight times. We were out for almost six hours.\n\nI could tell everyone in my family was notably uncomfortable, especially while we were eating, and I just kept going. I didn't apologise or explain, and the one person who asked why I wasn't covering up was shut down by my partner.\n\nUltimately I left feeling confident and they all left vaguely uncomfortable. My SIL was the only one who was happy for me, texting me later to comment on my \"boss mom shit\" lmao. She nursed her first for a month before moving to formula feeding (she couldn't handle constantly seperating herself away from them).\n\nSince Sunday I've had a few messages about the whole ordeal. A few shaming me for exposing myself to 'unwilling victims', some telling me I'm a bad mother for nursing around my oldest, etc etc. I mostly laughed. Some said I may have to be removed from family get togethers until I can \"reassess my priorities\".\n\nI don't care about their hurt feelings or the \"boundaries\" I crossed. You saw my tit flesh? Oh god the trauma. How very dare I? I'll pay for your next therapy session sweetheart. \n\nI think my blas\u00e9 reaction is also pissing them off. \n\nAnyway, I don't like the fact that my kids are gonna miss out on valuable cousin time; thats my only issue. I feel like I was an asshole definitely and I don't really want to apologise but on the other hand I don't want the kids to miss out because we, as adults, had issues. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

His assistive group thing (kinda like school, shorter hours and parents can stay if need be) is full of kids with differing needs.

Sounds like SHE gets more comfort out of breastfeeding than her children get nutrition.", "I read it.  Is there any actual reason for you to object to nursing toddlers?  Does milk cause medical harm of some kind I'm not aware of?\n\nWhat the hell is \"nursing excessively\" for a baby?  Are you under the impression that the baby is supposed to be on a diet?\n\nThe WHO recommends a minimum, not a maximum. The current paediatric thinking is that, basically, longer is better as long as mother and child are both still ok with it. Even 7 isn't unheard of - and there's some evidence that children who nurse longer become more independent; no study I'm aware of showing any harm. (If you have medical evidence to the contrary, I'll be surprised but feel free to provide it.)\n\nHumans evolved nursing for around 4 years as typical - that's _average_, not maximum. Most mammals nurse until the first permanent teeth come in.\n\nThe objections here are cultural hangup, not medical fact.", "Did you miss her explaining how her baby is coming out of cluster feeding? She's not doing it excessively", "Yes.  6 or 7 are at the upper end for human nursing but within human variation.  I believe there are a few studies that suggest it may help health and independence for the child, and none indicating harm, although I haven't done a full literature search.\n\nUnless you're aware of some medical evidence I don't know about, of course, in which case you're welcome to link to it.\n\n8 or 9 is too high; most mammals should stop nursing when permanent teeth come in and humans are probably no exception. But I'm not a paediatric specialist. (And I'm quite certain you aren't either.)\n\nI am, however, quite good at spotting when someone is resorting to hyperbole in the hope that it will make their personal prejudices seem justified.  \"Oh no!  You're still helping your children bathe when they're 5!  It won't be ok when they're 30, you sick freak!\"\n\nNobody is breast feeding at 9 here, except the person you made up in your head so you wouldn't have to discuss the actual facts of the case.", "That's definitely not the way you worded it.", "Does WHO recommend breastfeeding 6 year olds? We are not the same as \u201cmammals.\u201d", "She is \u201cday-weaning\u201d the 6-year old. I think it\u2019s reasonable to infer that he is dependent on her breast \u201cat night\u201d for self soothing. He can eat solids during the day. Her breast is just a pacifier at night.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that he is on solids during the day but not at night infers that she is \u201cok\u201d with her breast being a pacifier. So, why is it not reasonable that she could have the same philosophy at 9 years old? You\u2019re not as good at critical thinking as you think you are."]}
