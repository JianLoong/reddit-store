I am wife 2 of 3.  I came into Tim\u2019s life about 10 years ago when he was divorcing his first wife, Tara.  Tara and Tim had Billy (15M) and Charlotte (12F) together.  I have Maggie (7F) and Adam (4M) with him and now he is married to Amanda (30F) who has one child, Robbie (4M) from a previous relationship.  \n\n\n  \nAs I mentioned, I met my ex when while he was in the middle of his divorce and I was pretty young.  Tara and I had some difficulty at the beginning but when I became a mom myself, we had more in common and we began to build an actual relationship.  Unfortunately, that relationship was cut short when Tara got sick and passed 3 years ago.  Before she died, Tara asked me to look after her children and \u201ctreat them like my own\u201d to which I promised I would.  The stress of going from 2 to 4 kids full time and the pandemic ended my and Tim\u2019s marriage when he began hanging out with his co-worker, Amanda, instead of coming home.    \n\n\n  \nWhen we separated, I asked to continue to see my stepchildren and even asked to adopt them.  Amanda was not comfortable with this and Tim would not allow it but he promised the kids that they would have a relationship with me for as long as they wanted to.  I dropped the issue but told my stepkids that I am here for them whenever they need me.  Tim has allowed them to stay with me on the same schedule as our two which is basically every other week.  We live in the same town so it is not a problem at all.    \n\n\n  \nNow to the problem at hand.  This is the first year that Amanda is officially part of the family for Mother\u2019s Day and she text about 3 weeks ago and said her and Tim would host a brunch for all of us.  I did not see a reason for this and declined on behalf of myself and my bio kids.  I checked in with my stepkids and they hated the idea as well.  This will be the third Mother\u2019s Day without Tara and we started a little tradition to honor her and celebrate together.  We get up early and go to the cemetery and then share stories about her.  We laugh and cry and then go to her favorite place for breakfast. After that, we do something fun.   \n\n\n  \nBilly and Charlotte like the day as is and don\u2019t want someone who didn\u2019t know Tara around.  I communicated their feelings with their dad who is now calling me an AH for not forcing the issue or going to the brunch.  He said that because I won\u2019t go, his kids won\u2019t go and if he refuses to allow them to be with me (it\u2019s my week with my kids) then he would be going back on his promise to them.  He feels like I am making him pick between his wife and his children.  I don\u2019t think I should be forced to spend my Mother\u2019s Day with my ex, his new wife, and step-kid. Former MIL kind of feels like I took on this role of mom to my steps and should encourage them to share the day with their new stepmom.", "created_utc": 1683842015, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13f1bqm/aita_for_refusing_to_allow_the_new_wife_mothers/", "score": 420, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Mother's Day isn't a day of celebration for your step-children. They're still grieving their mother and their Dad's new wife never met her. You actually knew her and were with them as their mother died. She specifically asked you to look after them. \n\nAlso, I want to say something as someone whose father remarried multiple times. After the 2nd marriage fails all other wives just become Dad's latest wife. Same with women who are onto multiple marriages. You can't reasonably expect your child to take all your marriages seriously after the 2nd marriage. You can't keep getting remarried and forcing people to \"blend\" together. At some point there's clearly a person who's messing up everybody's life.", "Wait... Amanda (wife 3) had a say in the custody of kids from marriage 1? \nThe fact that she was around when you were just separating means he was cheating, right?", "You sound like an absolutely awesome step mom. You put the kids first. NTA.", "NTA. It seems Amanda is trying to drive a wedge between you and your stepkids, and their dad is totally for it. They want you out of the picture so Amanda can be the new stepmom (and unfortunately, possibly adopt the kids) and they can all be one big, happy family. Sucks that they're totally dismissing what the kids want. Stick to your guns, and talk to ex **with** the kids but **without** Amanda.", "NTA - You\u2019re the only one thinking about the kids here. You\u2019re awesome.\n\nI think the most that could be compromised on is the kids do something with Amanda after doing their normal tradition if they want to. But everything you guys do should stay the same, and they can choose if they want to add something extra with her (with you not needing to attend that, of course). But even that would be a lot for them to do; it\u2019d probably be best if they keep their tradition and leave her to spend the day with her own child.\n\nYou\u2019re providing them the love, stability, and support they really need. No one should even think of taking that away.", "NTA\n\nWow, sounds like wife #3 is on her way towards being the evil stepmom for these poor kids.\n\nThey already lost their bio mom just 3 years ago (and are still so young) and you thankfully put them under your wing. You respected their mother and built an important tradition for them to still feel close to their mom. But now it seems like your ex-husband just wants the kids to forget about their bio mom and just adopt this new wife as the new stepmom???\n\nIt's ridiculously tough going through this situation, the ex-husband needs to understand his kids. Why can't you guys do the normal tradition first with just you and the step kids and then do brunch with the new stepmom?", "NTA but Amanda and Tim sure are. Amanda, the affair partner, is because none of these kids are hers and to take away the special traditions you have made with Tara\u2019s kids because she thinks she\u2019s the mom now is selfish and arrogant. Timis, because it\u2019s your week and because he\u2019s breaking his promises all to satisfy his new wife. Amandas got her son to celebrate with. Tim needs to remember what Tara wanted.", "NTA but\u2026does he really wanna go down this path? Because at this point you could (maybe should) go to court for third party custody and get it\u2026then he (they) would be paying you support \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\nPerhaps counter with a Mother\u2019s Day brunch the day before?", "NTA the kids said they didn\u2019t wanna go themselves", "NTA , you seem to be doing the best for the children.", "Why bother? She\u2019ll be ex #3 when he gets tired of her. \nYou\u2019re under no obligation to spend Mother\u2019s Day with your ex-husband and his new wife. He is delusional.  NTA", "NTA - Aside from the awkwardness, does he not understand grief?\n\nI lost my mother six years ago as an adult and even I am not up for celebrating it with other female friends or relatives all these years later. It must be so much harder to through that as a child.\n\nAlso it\u2019s your weekend.", "I'm going with NTA because you're for doing what the older kids want. They've communicated their wishes, and if their dad doesn't like it, well, that's his problem.\n\nNot sure what business Tim's mom has weighing in, but go off I guess, lady.\n\nOh, and Amanda better watch her back.", "NTA. You don\u2019t have to go and if what you say is true then his kids with Tara also don\u2019t want to go and I think the tradition you have is nice. However maybe there\u2019s some compromise here where you do the tradition you have and then encourage the kids (Tara\u2019s) to be open minded about their new step mom and maybe do a dinner. None of which you or your bio kids have to go to.", "Nta. Kudos to for staying involved with step kids after the divorce. I love the tradition and don\u2019t see any reason to change it. \n\nI see why Tara wants to get to know the kids but not that day. You could suggest an alternate day for the brunch just to keep the peace.\n\nETA does the stepmom know about the tradition because of it wasn\u2019t for that the ask is not unreasonable?", "Honestly, Tim sounds like a big fat mess. He has a lot of self-work to do.", "\u201cHe feels like I am making him pick between his wife and his children.\u201d\n\nNo, you\u2019re backing his children. His wife is the one making him pick.\n\nAt 15 and 12, them wanting to spend Mother\u2019s Day honouring their deceased mother together with the mother figure who loved them so much she wanted to adopt them is a choice he should respect. Amanda is his wife, not their new mother. (Edit to note: I am not suggesting OP was their new mother either. She became a mother-figure through demonstrations of love and respect, not title.)\n\nNTA", "NTA , You sound like you were a great Stepmom and former MIL has a point, BUT (and it's a big one .....) It's Billy and Charlotte's choice on how they would like to celebrate Mother's Day, surely ?\n\nAny half decent Parent would lay down the options and support the kids' choice on how to spend the day, rather than just impose a new Stepmom into the mix, especially in these circumstances.", "NTA\n\nThe kids should come first. And the kids want to keep the tradition you established with them to pay homage to their bio-mom and then go to breakfast. \n\nTim and Amanda and your former MIL should put the kids first, too. Why can't they have a luncheon instead of a brunch? Then the kids can spend the morning with you doing your tradition and everyone can go to the luncheon later?", "There's no comfortable way out of this, is there?  NTA, but this is only the first of many family gatherings like this.  I think you and Tim need to figure out some kind of workable arrangement like a rotation, as you're not going to be able to cut his new wife out forever.", "NTA. You have always had a routine to traditionally honor the step kids mother.  Aren\u2019t they old enough to now tell their father they want to celebrate with you?  He is being an AH threatening to go back on his promise", ">He feels like I am making him pick between his wife and his children.\n\nEveryone who has a choice to make has made it. You and the stepkids were invited to a brunch and you chose not to go.\n\nIf he wants to ignore his children's wishes then that is a choice that he and his new wife are making. You aren't making him do anything. \n\nNTA", "NTA - you\u2019re honoring Tara\u2019s wishes and the children\u2019s. Mother\u2019s day has taken on a new and special meaning for them and it\u2019s plain cruel of his new wife to take that away from them over some power trip. Tell your ex that he should have this conversation with his wife and with his children. You shouldn\u2019t be painted as the bad guy when you made a promise - which you\u2019ve upheld since. She can do her own mother\u2019s day activity maybe celebrate on a different day but if the kids don\u2019t even like her (from what it sounds like) they shouldn\u2019t be forced to do anything with her especially when it sounds so fresh as it is.", "> He feels like I am making him pick between his wife and his children.\n\nNo. His children matter most and are most important. If he thinks there even is a choice then his priorities are fucked.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nWhy do they think any of yalls kids would want to celebrate mothers day with this new woman?\n\nThey're not married, so she's not his wife, and not their step mom.\n\nHer daughter is not his child, biological or step. That child is not related in anyway to these other kids.\n\nTrying to include her on Mother's Day plans would only make sense if they had been together a few years, were married, or had a child together.", "You gotta get over that shit for your own mental health.", "Genuinely find this a hard one. \n\nI suspect he wanted the brunch because he didn't want anyone to be excluded neither you nor his new wife.\n\nThis said it sounds like what you have organised is bloody important and good for the kids. \n\nIs it possible to do your process first then go for lunch?", "NAH except your Ex and his new wife.   You are on the hook, he's going to punish those kids by keeping them from you year around if you don't relent so you really probably should play the long game here.   See a lawyer, if you have no shot at getting any type of custody if your former step kids then you either cut them loose and let them fight it out or give into the black mail.  \n\nYou would NTA to me if you just say no and let the kids torcher their dad until he give in and lets them come back to you.", "INFO: is there some reason you can\u2019t do the long standing tradition and also meet up with the rest of the family later in the day?\n\nHonestly, the man is going to keep leaving a trail of ex wives and children behind him, it\u2019s best if you all try to get along. Why not give Amanda a chance to be as great a step mom as you are?", "Could you offer to do dinner, if they\u2019ll compromise? That way the kids don\u2019t have their 3rd Mother\u2019s Day without bio-mom interrupted by new step-mom (which would only lead to resentment ofc??) and the new wife can feel included?

Her ex-husband should be so thankful that they at least have 1 good parent left since he decided to go and cheat on this selfless and loving woman who was raising his other 2 kids as her own after such a tragedy. 2 to 4 kids is so difficult and I commend OP for sacrificing herself and making this as smooth of a transition as possible for them. I must remind you that ex-husband is the one who sabotaged things and are getting the kids caught in the middle. \n\nDo you really think OP will be vouching for the new stepmom who was her ex's affair partner? You must be crazy to think she and the kids will willingly accept her as their new stepmom after all the pain and drama that ensued.
