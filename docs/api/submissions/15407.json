I've met both before, but not for extended periods of time. I had two nephews and a niece before this new marriage. My oldest nephew is around my daughter's age. We all went on a camping trip together last weekend, and I figured it would be a lot with so many kids, but it was a disaster.\n\nMy nephews and niece have been camping before, but this was the first time for the new kids. Their mom also didn't come because she's pregnant. So it was my wife and I with our daughter plus my brother and five kids. So obviously we had to help out. Now the older of the two kids was a little confused and nervous about camping, but he tried his best. He even wanted to cook over the campfire for everyone. The resultant dish was a horrible mess, but we ate it with a smile because it's the thought that counts.\n\nThe younger brother was obnoxious the whole time. He complained about his phone being dead. He complained about the heat. He complained about the bugs. He complained he couldn't poop without a real toilet. It was neverending with this kid.\n\nWhen we were checking out of the campsite the kids were looking at souvenirs for sale. The older of the new nephews told my oldest nephew he thought the arrowhead necklace (fake) was so cool. I decided to buy it for him. The other new nephew asked if he could have one too. I said no because \"you don't actually want one, you just want it because your brother got one.\"\n\nMy brother ended up asking me about it later. I said I bought the older boy a gift because he made an effort at camping, and the younger boy didn't really care about the necklace, he just wanted it to get something, and that's a waste of money. My brother said it is unfair to get one kid a gift and not the other. I said \"why punish someone because their brother is being a little shit? That's not fair.\"\n\nMy brother said the boys are at different development stages. They are 9 & 11, so not really. I said I don't reward bad behavior, but he is welcome to, because they are his kids, not mine. He said I'm being an asshole and making his new son feel unwelcome. I also didn't buy a souvenir for my daughter or other nephews, although I did get my niece some crystals, so it's not like I singled him out.

Imagine he hated it. That camping just isn't exciting to him, he is scared of bugs, and genuinely had a bad time. He tried to distract himself with his phone, but that died, too. He tells the grown ups about how he feels, because that is what he is supposed to do, but they kinda just dismiss him in a clearly annoyed way.\n\nThen, instead of at least getting a cool necklace out of it, he basically gets punished for acting immature at 9 years old and gets put in competition for your love with his brother.\n\nYou tell me, OP. Are you TA?", "Where the boys asked for an opinion about this camping plan? Sounds like they have never done anything like this before, and expecting them to be excited sounds unfair. A sensible option would have been to test the waters with an afternoon and then proceed from there.

I also think you\u2019re being way too hard on the kid, especially when this is a new activity and he\u2019s dealing with a new family dynamic.", "YTA. I\u2019m not sure there is a correlation between pooping without a toilet and liking a necklace. A 9 year old whose never been camping is in for a culture shock. Sounds to me like you wanted an opportunity to get back at this kid for annoying you.", "Massive YTA, you\u2019re playing childish mind games with a 9 y-o. Grow up and quit being so cruel.", "\"I'm acting like a little child because my brother dragged his kid into doing something and he didn't enoy it. AITA for being more immature than the 9 year old?\"\n\nFixed your post.\n\nYTA.", "YTA, my youngest is 8 and we have been on extended (3 week +) 9000km (5592 mile) trips since he was born\n\nIn January he slept 21 nights in a swag\n\nHe still won\u2019t poop in a drop toilet after 8 years and I\u2019ll dig him a hole in the scrub to poop as he\u2019s more comfortable \n\nWe\u2019ve had 14 day long trips of no complaints v 3 days of feralness\n\nWe\u2019ve had days of complaining no wi-fi or tablet didn\u2019t charge, distract and move on\n\nWe\u2019ve had days complaining of flies (we live in Australia) and we coped\n\nDo I still buy him souvenirs? Hell yes, I have crusty days at 41 when travelling myself.

Hiking? Card games? Nature scavenger hunts? Hangman?\n\nBored kids are naturally whiny kids", "Why argue with us? In fact why even come here if you aren't going to accept the answer?", "YTA. It was their first time camping and your first time getting to bond with your new nephews. You're the adult here. The kid is 9. To him, it might be scary trying to dig a hole to poop rather than being able to use a toilet. \n\nIt's normal for kids to complain. I'm a teacher, so, believe me, I know there are some kids who are whinier than others. I also know it's an unpopular thing to say, but you end up disliking the whiney kids. I often say something to kids like, \"I can tell you're frustrated right now, but you're starting to whine and it makes it difficult for me to understand what you're saying. I want to help. Take a breath, and then can you restart and tell me what happened again?\" Inside, I'm thinking, \"OMG, stop whining already!\" I don't say that part aloud because I'm an adult, and I'm talking to children.\n\nI get it. Your new nephew was whining all weekend, and you didn't enjoy his company. However, you are the adult. You don't show a kid you don't like them and play favorites. It's a really, really poopy way to act. It's not normal to buy a gift at the end of one child but not both. It shows favoritism. Now that is how the kid is going to remember the camping trip and you. Imagine always being remembered as the aunt who plays favorites and buys gifts for one kid but not another! This is going to be a difficult relationship to repair.", "YTA. So the 9 year old had a shite time...and you made it even more shite by refusing to buy him a gift because he wasn't having fun and voiced his feelings. Try for some empathy. You could have left him with one happy memory and chose not to.", "Yeah.  Definitely YTA.  You are clearly not a neuroscientist, because there is a ton of changes in the brain and body between the ages of 9 and 11.  How can there not be?  And there is another 2 years of experience as well.  \n\nYou say the older of the two was confused and nervous.  Well if the older one was that, and he takes some cues from the older one, what do you think the younger one was?  Extra confused and panicked? That two years difference is what allowed the older one to be nervous, but still move forward instead of just be upset.  \n\nWhat is worse is you didn't even connect denying him a gift to how he behaved.  You just decided to give the older one something, and then call him out for wanting something his brother wants.  Every kid wants something when their brother gets something.  You know this, since you have a brother.\n\nYou decided to punish him and didn't even tell him it's because he doesn't want to poop on a pit toilet, or it's because he complained too much for your liking when he was hot.  You just let him think you don't like him, so he doesn't even know how to earn your praise or do it right in your eyes.   Next time take him aside and be his mentor.  Since everyone else is doing it the way you expect, he is the one that needs the help.  And he will love you for it.\n\nAnd finally, in your title you say you implied he was a little shit.  You said those words.  That is more than implying.  He was a kid out of his element trying to get reassurance. You can come up with better language to describe the situation.  Your problem is that he is immature.  But if you call him immature then you can't blame him.  If you call him a little shit then you are right to act the way you did.\n\nI'm sorry your weekend was ruined by his presence.  Don't camp with them for a couple years since his age isn't your cup of tea.", "YTA. It sounds like your step nephew had some genuine complaints, and you didn't show him an ounce of empathy. Between your behavior and your comments, I think someone in this story is a little shit, and it's not the kid.", "So you bullied a 9yo who\u2019s adjusting to a new life and family? For behaving like a 9yo? Bc let\u2019s be clear, it\u2019s not like he\u2019s got the autonomy to say \u2018nah, not my thing, I\u2019ll just stay home\u2019. He got shoved into a situation with a new family in an activity that is absolutely not for everyone (and learned that his mom just married into a family with at least one gigantic asshole)\n\nYTA obviously. Grow tf up", "YTA. There were rules to getting the gift that he didn't know about. You made them up to justify your reasoning.\n\nA kid who has never been camping before that now has to rough it and doesn't have the electronics he is used to is going to complain. As an adult, I won't camp anywhere that doesn't have a bath house with real toilets. I wouldn't expect a first-time camper to be OK with pooping without a toilet.\n\nAnd 9 and 11 are very different developmentally.", "YTA and if you hadn\u2019t said you had a child and wife yourself, I would have assumed you weren\u2019t much older than the kids, based on how you talk about them and interacted.", "YTA. Why are you here complaining like a little shit. Just smile and move along. Sheesh what an AH.", "YTA. \n\nIt was their first time camping and didn\u2019t know what to expect and he voiced that he didn\u2019t like the experience. That doesn\u2019t make him a little shit, it just means he didn\u2019t like it and that\u2019s how that age group communicates. I have 3 boys, 2 of which are also 9 & 11 and my 9 year old will complain about everything he doesn\u2019t like but is quiet about things he does like, until it\u2019s over and he\u2019s reminiscing he\u2019ll bring up what he enjoyed. \n\nMaybe the kid did like the necklaces but didn\u2019t say anything - but i feel that if he even did you wouldn\u2019t have bought it for him because by the sounds of it, you don\u2019t like him.", "YTA. He's a 9 year old child. Utterly bizarre that the slave labour of the older child cooking for the entire camp wasn't  enough (nobody helped then had the nerve to call it a horrible mess??)\n\nThe fact that you would punish a child because he didn't behave how you wanted to AND gave him a FALSE reason for doing so, is astonishing. That's so fkd up. The necklace has nothing to do with his attitude towards camping. If you had an issue with his attitude you should have told him then not wait for a special, unrelated moment to punish him.\n\nHow did you deal with him when he was complaining about everything? Did you reassure him? Did you give any sign of not being pleased? Or did you just, out of nowhere (to him), pick on this child?\n\nDid the adults just sit and make judgements of the kids the whole time? Did they ever do anything themselves?\n\nWtf kind of camping trip is this?", "YTA. For an effective punishment the person needs to understand the action and the corresponding consequence. Did you say or do anything at the time when the kid was being a brat, or was it only when you bought his brother something?", "ESH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu are an AH for how you reat your stepnephew.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOur brother is an AH for taking kids camping when they don't want to camp.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He does not have a choice on whether or not to be there. It's not his fault he didn't enjoy himself; he's allowed to enjoy different things. He's allowed to be frustrated that he's been dragged to an environment that is not fun to him,  especially when some of the adults around are angry that he *dares* to not have fun. \n\nYou're a fucking adult blaming a literal child for not enjoying a situation that he had no choice over. YTA. Grow the fuck up.", "NAH.  The boys were put in a situation that they prolly didn't ask for and prolly were not consulted about.  I agree with the earlier commenter that our job as a parent is to expose our children to new experiences.  Some the kids will like, some they won't.  \n\nI also deeply believe in not rewarding poor behavior.  I have a niece that was supremely bratty to most of our family.  One day she brought a friend to my mom's house - her friend was lovely and very nice to be around.  The niece did not even acknowledge me - niece was 9 at the time.  During the afternoon the ice cream man drove down our street and I was outside, niece runs up to me and says something like \"Auntie, please please please buy us some ice cream.\"  I looked at her friend and said \"I am so sorry I would like to buy you ice cream bc you have been a delightful guest all day.\"  Then I looked at niece and said \"No, you have been rude and inconsiderate all day.\"  Yea, I caught a lot of crap from family about this, but too damn bad.", "Yta yta yta holy shit yta. Poor kid. You need to grow up and look at yourself.", "honestly, what you did is wrong. You bought something for one kid, and you had to buy for the other. They are so called new kids in the family. very sensitive maybe.\n\nyou are nice to take the new kids with you even without the mother. if i were in your position, I will not do it. You don't know them at all. you need their mother's help to build a relationshio with them slowly.\n\nit is too harsh to take them to some activities with your family.\n\nYou really need to slow down with them until their mother, you sil are involved.", "NTA-I agree with you, but I also know that we will be in the minority. I do not believe kids need to be treated exactly equally or that money should be spent on them exactly equally. I believe in the give them everything they NEED model-which results in different expenditures and treatment. \n\nYou are correct. You didn\u2019t single out the younger step-nephew either. You didn\u2019t buy something for everyone. \n\nIf it makes you feel better, using this form of parenting really worked super well for me. (Mine are 20-25 and we are finished parenting and have released independent adults to the world.) I\u2019m sure your daughter is going to be a fabulous, & accomplished adult.\n\nAnd you might want to have a private conversation with your brother that he is welcome to handle his adulting however he wants, but he probably shouldn\u2019t give you advice unless you ask for it. If he thought what you did was unfair, he could have simply fixed it by buying everyone else something.", "My step daughters first camping trip was a nightmare! She complained the whole time, no phone, nowhere to plug up her curling iron, yada yada. My daughter in laws first camping trip, same. She tried to order a pizza and have my son go pick it up. To each their own, but buying a gift for one and not the other who was also in your company at the time, is not justified. If he only wanted the necklace because his brother was getting one, then redirect him to get something he would like. Poor kid didn't adjust well to the environment on his first trip and didn't meet your expectations, thats not a behavior issue on his part. Maybe next trip add in a water rafting activity or something to entice him into some fun aspects.", "YTA. You are not his father. You have no say on how to reward or discipline someone else's child. You should have never bought the necklace for the older child. Imagine being 9 and your mother throws you into a new family with a new dad and then makes a new baby with him. And then makes you go camping with a step uncle that favors your brother for having more common interest in something you don't find fun. Imagine having a mom that thinks it was a good idea to even send this struggling kid on said camping trip. Imagine your own kid in this situation. Then tell me if you'd be a perfectly behaved 9 year old boy.", "NTA. I know you'll get some people calling you an asshole, but pay them no mind.

He's a child, the adults are responsible for his needs and this is a basic one. \n\nI don't think you're necessarily an AH for hurting his feelings after he behaved badly, behaving badly has consequences. But I do think you all could have demonstrated more care for this child, at which point he might have been able and motivated to behave better, which would have been better for everyone. \n\nYou also accidentally a word so I don't know who the crystals were for.

I told my \"at risk\" high school students on day one that there's really nothing I can do to them by way of consequences, because getting written up doesn't really change much, but that I had a job to do and I couldn't let them keep me from doing it. I told them I wanted their collaboration and that we would all have a better year if they tried to do the right thing most of the time and that worked very well for me and for them. \n\nMy own child is self aware and intrinsically motivated. He's about to graduate high school number 5 in his class and go to an excellent school with a competitive scholarship. \n\nHe did all that. I didn't do it. I never checked homework or fought with him about school. But I provided the philosophical framework in which he made his choices. I laid the foundation, and that foundation is reality and honesty. \n\nIf you act like an asshole, people won't like you, and when they don't like you, you have fewer opportunities in the world. This is *very different* from how I talked about *who you are*. Be who you are and if people don't like it, oh well. You'll sleep fine at night knowing you're true to yourself. What you do and who you are inside are related, but they're not the same thing. Save alienating people for your core values.

But if you do buy him a necklace you also teach a lesson.\n\nMate, you're overthinking this. OP did right, and not buying the gift was no \"punishment\". You don't get punished if random desires are not immediately fulfilled - come on...", "I wasn't teaching anyone anything. I'm not a piggybank.", "Not buying a gift for a child isn't a punishment! The way, IMO, to raise a child is \"pain for pleasure and pleasure for pain\". That summary might be over simplified and the \"pain\" wording part might have negative connotations but it applies to what OP did and didn't do. He was NTA.\n\nPain for pleasure (punishment for taking pleasure in doing something wrong). If a child hits someone or breaks something if they are upset (for childish reasons, of course if there is a serious underlying problem address it, but not all of a kid's actions are that deep) because it makes them feel better to let their anger out that way, they are taking \"pleasure\" in hurting someone else. This is when you punish them. This does not mean physical violence, but some form of consequences for their actions (time-out, grounding, taking away a device or toy). We do not cause \"pain for pain\" or rather punish a child if they find something uncomfortable, like not going to bed alone cause they're scared of the dark, or complaining about the lack of comforts in a new situation (like camping). OP did not punish the kid for his pain, he put up with it and didn't reward it. A gift (like a necklace) is a reward and a lack of one is not a punishment. \n\nPleasure for pain is rewarding a child for a good behavior they find uncomfortable (like being scared of going camping for the first time but putting in the effort anyway by making a meal over the campfire). This is to reinforce good behaviors. In the going to bed example, you could buy a toy for the scared kid, \"reward\" them for the first couple nights for going to bed alone (with decreasing cost: night 1. Toy, night 2. Smaller toy, night 3. Candy, and after a few days you'll have proved to the child they can go to bed alone without issue and thus doesn't require the rewards). The OP did this with the necklace. \"Pleasure for pleasure\" (rewarding good behavior for things that make the kid happy) shouldn't be necessary as the task itself is it's own reward (e.g. if the kids like camping, they don't need a gift since they enjoyed the experience). \n\nOf course, this doesn't work for all situations or families but I think it applies to this scenario and the OP is NTA per his actions.

I literally asked a yes or no question.", "If she didn't enjoy her time and the kids influenced it, doesn't that kinda answer your question. Not that I'm on her side,  but sometimes I wonder why people ask questions that seem contradictory.\n\nI mean.

Because in his mind if we had children we'd agree with what he did and not say he's TA.", "because the second someone critiques someone else\u2019s parenting skills, it\u2019s clear they \u201cdon\u2019t have kids\u201d \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "because the most represented demographic on here is 13-25 year old females", "No. We\u2019re expecting an adult to act like one.", "Exactly, lol.

I have an objection to buying his brother the neclace and not him, essentially because \"he behaved better\".\n\nThat's a little above and beyond passive parenting.", "Apparently you are when you pleased with the kids performance at camping, lol.

I don't know anyone who would parent this way.\n\nI would never parent my three children this way.", "One of them saw a cool thing.

He's reaching for straws, trying his best to justify his behaviour.\n\n\"Everyone that is a rational parent would do this.\" No sir.\n\nHe's saying the 9 year old only asked for something because someone else asked first.\n\nSo does that mean when he takes his own kids out that only ONE of his children is allowed something and the rest get nothing because \"x child asked first and the rest are only asking because x did.\"\n\nBunch of bullshit reasoning. He was punishing the kid.\n\nHe had a moment to make this child who apparently hated the trip have at least one good thing/memory to take away from the whole thing. And OP shat on that very purposefully.", "> The second saw his brother get a thing and then he decided he wanted one too\n\nThat sounds like seeing a cool thing to me."]}
