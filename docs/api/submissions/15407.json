I've met both before, but not for extended periods of time. I had two nephews and a niece before this new marriage. My oldest nephew is around my daughter's age. We all went on a camping trip together last weekend, and I figured it would be a lot with so many kids, but it was a disaster.\n\nMy nephews and niece have been camping before, but this was the first time for the new kids. Their mom also didn't come because she's pregnant. So it was my wife and I with our daughter plus my brother and five kids. So obviously we had to help out. Now the older of the two kids was a little confused and nervous about camping, but he tried his best. He even wanted to cook over the campfire for everyone. The resultant dish was a horrible mess, but we ate it with a smile because it's the thought that counts.\n\nThe younger brother was obnoxious the whole time. He complained about his phone being dead. He complained about the heat. He complained about the bugs. He complained he couldn't poop without a real toilet. It was neverending with this kid.\n\nWhen we were checking out of the campsite the kids were looking at souvenirs for sale. The older of the new nephews told my oldest nephew he thought the arrowhead necklace (fake) was so cool. I decided to buy it for him. The other new nephew asked if he could have one too. I said no because \"you don't actually want one, you just want it because your brother got one.\"\n\nMy brother ended up asking me about it later. I said I bought the older boy a gift because he made an effort at camping, and the younger boy didn't really care about the necklace, he just wanted it to get something, and that's a waste of money. My brother said it is unfair to get one kid a gift and not the other. I said \"why punish someone because their brother is being a little shit? That's not fair.\"\n\nMy brother said the boys are at different development stages. They are 9 & 11, so not really. I said I don't reward bad behavior, but he is welcome to, because they are his kids, not mine. He said I'm being an asshole and making his new son feel unwelcome. I also didn't buy a souvenir for my daughter or other nephews, although I did get my niece some crystals, so it's not like I singled him out.

It was their first time camping and your first time getting to bond with your new nephews. You're the adult here. The kid is 9. To him, it might be scary trying to dig a hole to poop rather than being able to use a toilet. \n\nIt's normal for kids to complain. I'm a teacher, so, believe me, I know there are some kids who are whinier than others. I also know it's an unpopular thing to say, but you end up disliking the whiney kids. I often say something to kids like, \"I can tell you're frustrated right now, but you're starting to whine and it makes it difficult for me to understand what you're saying. I want to help. Take a breath, and then can you restart and tell me what happened again?\" Inside, I'm thinking, \"OMG, stop whining already!\" I don't say that part aloud because I'm an adult, and I'm talking to children.\n\nI get it. Your new nephew was whining all weekend, and you didn't enjoy his company. However, you are the adult. You don't show a kid you don't like them and play favorites. It's a really, really poopy way to act. It's not normal to buy a gift at the end of one child but not both. It shows favoritism. Now that is how the kid is going to remember the camping trip and you. Imagine always being remembered as the aunt who plays favorites and buys gifts for one kid but not another! This is going to be a difficult relationship to repair.", "YTA. So the 9 year old had a shite time...and you made it even more shite by refusing to buy him a gift because he wasn't having fun and voiced his feelings. Try for some empathy. You could have left him with one happy memory and chose not to.", "Yeah.  Definitely YTA.  You are clearly not a neuroscientist, because there is a ton of changes in the brain and body between the ages of 9 and 11.  How can there not be?  And there is another 2 years of experience as well.  \n\nYou say the older of the two was confused and nervous.  Well if the older one was that, and he takes some cues from the older one, what do you think the younger one was?  Extra confused and panicked? That two years difference is what allowed the older one to be nervous, but still move forward instead of just be upset.  \n\nWhat is worse is you didn't even connect denying him a gift to how he behaved.  You just decided to give the older one something, and then call him out for wanting something his brother wants.  Every kid wants something when their brother gets something.  You know this, since you have a brother.\n\nYou decided to punish him and didn't even tell him it's because he doesn't want to poop on a pit toilet, or it's because he complained too much for your liking when he was hot.  You just let him think you don't like him, so he doesn't even know how to earn your praise or do it right in your eyes.   Next time take him aside and be his mentor.  Since everyone else is doing it the way you expect, he is the one that needs the help.  And he will love you for it.\n\nAnd finally, in your title you say you implied he was a little shit.  You said those words.  That is more than implying.  He was a kid out of his element trying to get reassurance. You can come up with better language to describe the situation.  Your problem is that he is immature.  But if you call him immature then you can't blame him.  If you call him a little shit then you are right to act the way you did.\n\nI'm sorry your weekend was ruined by his presence.  Don't camp with them for a couple years since his age isn't your cup of tea.", "YTA. It sounds like your step nephew had some genuine complaints, and you didn't show him an ounce of empathy. Between your behavior and your comments, I think someone in this story is a little shit, and it's not the kid.", "So you bullied a 9yo who\u2019s adjusting to a new life and family? For behaving like a 9yo? Bc let\u2019s be clear, it\u2019s not like he\u2019s got the autonomy to say \u2018nah, not my thing, I\u2019ll just stay home\u2019.

Grow tf up", "YTA. There were rules to getting the gift that he didn't know about. You made them up to justify your reasoning.\n\nA kid who has never been camping before that now has to rough it and doesn't have the electronics he is used to is going to complain. As an adult, I won't camp anywhere that doesn't have a bath house with real toilets. I wouldn't expect a first-time camper to be OK with pooping without a toilet.\n\nAnd 9 and 11 are very different developmentally.", "YTA and if you hadn\u2019t said you had a child and wife yourself, I would have assumed you weren\u2019t much older than the kids, based on how you talk about them and interacted.", "YTA. Why are you here complaining like a little shit. Just smile and move along. Sheesh what an AH.", "YTA. \n\nIt was their first time camping and didn\u2019t know what to expect and he voiced that he didn\u2019t like the experience. That doesn\u2019t make him a little shit, it just means he didn\u2019t like it and that\u2019s how that age group communicates. I have 3 boys, 2 of which are also 9 & 11 and my 9 year old will complain about everything he doesn\u2019t like but is quiet about things he does like, until it\u2019s over and he\u2019s reminiscing he\u2019ll bring up what he enjoyed. \n\nMaybe the kid did like the necklaces but didn\u2019t say anything - but i feel that if he even did you wouldn\u2019t have bought it for him because by the sounds of it, you don\u2019t like him.", "YTA. He's a 9 year old child. Utterly bizarre that the slave labour of the older child cooking for the entire camp wasn't  enough (nobody helped then had the nerve to call it a horrible mess??)\n\nThe fact that you would punish a child because he didn't behave how you wanted to AND gave him a FALSE reason for doing so, is astonishing. That's so fkd up. The necklace has nothing to do with his attitude towards camping. If you had an issue with his attitude you should have told him then not wait for a special, unrelated moment to punish him.\n\nHow did you deal with him when he was complaining about everything? Did you reassure him? Did you give any sign of not being pleased? Or did you just, out of nowhere (to him), pick on this child?\n\nDid the adults just sit and make judgements of the kids the whole time? Did they ever do anything themselves?\n\nWtf kind of camping trip is this?", "YTA. For an effective punishment the person needs to understand the action and the corresponding consequence. Did you say or do anything at the time when the kid was being a brat, or was it only when you bought his brother something?", "ESH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu are an AH for how you reat your stepnephew.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOur brother is an AH for taking kids camping when they don't want to camp.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He does not have a choice on whether or not to be there. It's not his fault he didn't enjoy himself; he's allowed to enjoy different things.

I agree with the earlier commenter that our job as a parent is to expose our children to new experiences.  Some the kids will like, some they won't.  \n\nI also deeply believe in not rewarding poor behavior.  I have a niece that was supremely bratty to most of our family.  One day she brought a friend to my mom's house - her friend was lovely and very nice to be around.  The niece did not even acknowledge me - niece was 9 at the time.  During the afternoon the ice cream man drove down our street and I was outside, niece runs up to me and says something like \"Auntie, please please please buy us some ice cream.\"  I looked at her friend and said \"I am so sorry I would like to buy you ice cream bc you have been a delightful guest all day.\"  Then I looked at niece and said \"No, you have been rude and inconsiderate all day.\"  Yea, I caught a lot of crap from family about this, but too damn bad.", "Yta yta yta holy shit yta.

I do not believe kids need to be treated exactly equally or that money should be spent on them exactly equally. I believe in the give them everything they NEED model-which results in different expenditures and treatment. \n\nYou are correct. You didn\u2019t single out the younger step-nephew either. You didn\u2019t buy something for everyone. \n\nIf it makes you feel better, using this form of parenting really worked super well for me. (Mine are 20-25 and we are finished parenting and have released independent adults to the world.) I\u2019m sure your daughter is going to be a fabulous, & accomplished adult.\n\nAnd you might want to have a private conversation with your brother that he is welcome to handle his adulting however he wants, but he probably shouldn\u2019t give you advice unless you ask for it. If he thought what you did was unfair, he could have simply fixed it by buying everyone else something.", "My step daughters first camping trip was a nightmare! She complained the whole time, no phone, nowhere to plug up her curling iron, yada yada. My daughter in laws first camping trip, same. She tried to order a pizza and have my son go pick it up. To each their own, but buying a gift for one and not the other who was also in your company at the time, is not justified. If he only wanted the necklace because his brother was getting one, then redirect him to get something he would like. Poor kid didn't adjust well to the environment on his first trip and didn't meet your expectations, thats not a behavior issue on his part. Maybe next trip add in a water rafting activity or something to entice him into some fun aspects.", "YTA. You are not his father. You have no say on how to reward or discipline someone else's child. You should have never bought the necklace for the older child. Imagine being 9 and your mother throws you into a new family with a new dad and then makes a new baby with him. And then makes you go camping with a step uncle that favors your brother for having more common interest in something you don't find fun. Imagine having a mom that thinks it was a good idea to even send this struggling kid on said camping trip. Imagine your own kid in this situation. Then tell me if you'd be a perfectly behaved 9 year old boy.", "NTA. I know you'll get some people calling you an asshole, but pay them no mind.

The way, IMO, to raise a child is \"pain for pleasure and pleasure for pain\". That summary might be over simplified and the \"pain\" wording part might have negative connotations but it applies to what OP did and didn't do. He was NTA.\n\nPain for pleasure (punishment for taking pleasure in doing something wrong). If a child hits someone or breaks something if they are upset (for childish reasons, of course if there is a serious underlying problem address it, but not all of a kid's actions are that deep) because it makes them feel better to let their anger out that way, they are taking \"pleasure\" in hurting someone else. This is when you punish them. This does not mean physical violence, but some form of consequences for their actions (time-out, grounding, taking away a device or toy). We do not cause \"pain for pain\" or rather punish a child if they find something uncomfortable, like not going to bed alone cause they're scared of the dark, or complaining about the lack of comforts in a new situation (like camping). OP did not punish the kid for his pain, he put up with it and didn't reward it. A gift (like a necklace) is a reward and a lack of one is not a punishment. \n\nPleasure for pain is rewarding a child for a good behavior they find uncomfortable (like being scared of going camping for the first time but putting in the effort anyway by making a meal over the campfire). This is to reinforce good behaviors. In the going to bed example, you could buy a toy for the scared kid, \"reward\" them for the first couple nights for going to bed alone (with decreasing cost: night 1. Toy, night 2. Smaller toy, night 3. Candy, and after a few days you'll have proved to the child they can go to bed alone without issue and thus doesn't require the rewards). The OP did this with the necklace. \"Pleasure for pleasure\" (rewarding good behavior for things that make the kid happy) shouldn't be necessary as the task itself is it's own reward (e.g. if the kids like camping, they don't need a gift since they enjoyed the experience). \n\nOf course, this doesn't work for all situations or families but I think it applies to this scenario and the OP is NTA per his actions.

My sister and I are 3 years apart, we were raised pretty much the same way, except my dad was harsher on me for whatever reason he felt necessary at the time. (I'm the youngest, he has a younger brother that we don't talk to, take from that what you will.) Anyway, when my sister hit puberty, it was taken as read that I would suddenly grow up and start trying to adult like my sister. It didn't work that way. I was still trying to do kid things, like play with friends and climb trees. It didn't help that I was a tomboy and my sister is not.\n\nSo I learned that, in order to minimise attacks, I had to start copying everything my sister did. But she didn't like that, so she would throw a marn and tell our parents that I was copying her and annoying her on purpose. So I'd still get in trouble. On the rare occasion I was asked if I was having fun at something, (cousin took us to Margate) I answered honestly (no, it was way too loud, I didn't like being shoved or being made to stand on tip-toe to go on the big rides so nobody had to stay behind to wait with me) and I would be punished for being difficult. If I cried or showed any outward sign that I was unhappy (the day of the long walk with the broken toe was really fun /s) then I would be punished, because I was ruining it for everyone else.\n\nSo I hid all my emotions, bad and good (if I laughed too loud, then apparently I was being attention seeking and/or obnoxious) no matter my true feelings, experience or situation.\n\nI'm now 37, 38 next month and I still can't fully express or understand my own emotions or feelings. I push myself physically, far too hard (I also now have Fibromyalgia, yay /s) so I end up punishing myself, every day, because of treatment by the people who were supposed to understand or give a shit when I was a kid.\n\nJust something for you to think about, as your nephews (blood or marriage) grow older and start considering families of their own.\n\nYTA", "Unfortunately, I have to go with YTA.  I agree that the lid didn't really deserve it, but they are 9 and this was their first trip.  If you were willing to buy a couple of the kids something, amd this kid asked for something too, should have done it.  It doesn't sounds like they did anything specifically wrong, just whined and didn't enjoy camping.\n\nThat being said though, good job including everyone in the trio and trying to have a fun family experience.", "NTA", " NAH\nMy cousin spoiled her kids and rewarded bad behaviour, and I've been there from birth to them getting married and I've seen the behavior it creates. Her kids are entitled and demand everything, and lose their shits when they don't get it. Rewarding bad behavior is not a good thing to do.\n\nHowever, yeah the kids probably didn't want to be there, but that's what teaching is. Getting kids out of their comfort zone to see if they may like another activity. If they absolutely don't like it, find something else.", "NTA, this is because if your brother is a legal guardian of the step kids he should treat them the same way he'd treat his bio-kids. Now the brother was wrong at the end for trying to \"call you out\" seeing as there was no wrong behavior circulating from you. It was from the 9 yro. If your brothers kid was being a little ass-wipe that's bad behavior and seeing as he just wanted something because someone else got it he really didn't want it. Now if he knew prior to going to the gift shop he was going he should've stop his behavior and acted like a civil human being. So you're not the ass here it's your brother for not watching his kids and thinking it's cute to reward bad behavior.", "YTA. I can\u2019t even imagine treating a 9 year old this cold.  Nothing you stated makes him a brat, it makes him a 9 year old that\u2019s discovering he doesn\u2019t like camping and is trying to communicate.  How fragile do you have to be to take that as a personal attack?", "YTA and the fact that you think 9 and 11 year olds are the same mentally coupled with your absolute lack of empathy for 2 kids tossed into an uncomfortable situation with basically STRANGERS makes me sad that you unfortunately have a child. Good luck to her", "Being seen as fair is important to kids (and to adults) so I probably would have given all the kids a set amount to choose a small souvenir for themselves. They would have a lot of fun choosing and would think \"Uncle John\" was the greatest. Even the difficult kid might appreciate it.", "You were being unkind. These kids are young. They are trying to integrate into a new family situation. Their mom is having another baby. Kids react differently to stressful situations. Often the kid that acts worse is really needing a lot more love and grace from adults around them. You unnecessarily added to his emotional load. It seems like a small thing, but kids take things hard. And kids do not often realize when they are being a pain in the ass to adults. His complaints were a clue to how out of his depth and uncomfortable he was in the situation. Get out there and be a supportive uncle to him. He\u2019s gonna need it.", "YTA.

Now he also will likely never like you either, and for good reason.", "YTA \u2014 I\u2019d do my best to educate you to be a better parent and man, op. \n\nBut I don\u2019t reward bad behavior", "YTA- damn dude, that was cold blooded.

Whisper that it\u2019s real so it\u2019s even cooler. Try to salvage the relationship with everyone. Kids are forgiving so you would probably become the coolest guy ever to him instead of the biggest jerk on earth.", "YTA. I fucking hate camping and am miserable when doing it. And I'm an adult that can actually behave when I have too. The kid was miserable and hated the experience, of course you're going to see him at his worst. \n\nGive the kid another chance.

You cooked us a meal(even if it was inedible), so I'd be honored to buy you that necklace.--that way it comes across as something Earned rather than a gift.\n\nBut in the end, no one is entitled to a gift--and certainly not a \"shit\" who has been working to make trip miserable(tho to be fair--he may be miserable with camping--some people are not nature \"naturals\" LOL).", "Sorry, YTA. Or, at least your brother kinda is. The kid is 9, dealing with a new family dynamic and a lot of those things he complained about grown adults would too. The adults should have tried a little harder to introduce kid friendly activities, brought fun snacks, or figured out it wasn\u2019t going well and packed it in early.\n\nWhen I was preteen, my grandmother and her cousin took my brother and I to Tennessee. So that -they- could enjoy Grand Ole Opry and Dollywood. At Dollywood, they had us show up two hours before the park opened and we had to STAND AROUND listen to piped banjo music in sweltering summer heat. You think that sounds like fun to kids? \n\nBut, but.. they had rollercoasters! And carnival food! And it\u2019s basically an amusement park! And we stopped at a gift shop! \n\nI will tell you a secret. The misery and boredom of the majority of that trip could NOT be overridden by a few hours of things that \u201cshould be fun for kids\u201d. We\u2019re in our 30s now and STILL complain about what an awful trip that was.", "This is a tough one. I see both sides of YTA and NTA. A question I have is when the kid was complaining did any of the adults try to comfort him and try to reassure him that camping can be fun? Encourage him to join in activities and listened to him? I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s not a situation where he was ignored.", "YTA. Yeah, 9 and 11 are very different even without accounting for the fact kids are individuals with their own interests. Not enjoying the outdoors isn\u2019t a crime. Your brother shouldn\u2019t have forced a kid to come along who clearly didn\u2019t want to be there, but you didn\u2019t have to make the experience extra miserable by refusing to buy something for a 9yo acting like a 9yo.", "INFO: Did any of the other kids ask for something and you refused to buy it, or was only your step-nephew\u2019s request turned down?", "Imagine thinking 9 and 11 are effectively the same age when it comes to maturity.

You're a grown adult angry at a child who had an awful camping experience with that minimal coping to help soothe it. \n\nInstead of really recognizing that he was struggling and trying to make it comfortable/fun for him you held a vendetta and decided he was a brat, then you refused to get him a necklace to even give anything positive to take from the experience. \n\nHe's a part of your family now, act like it.", "YTA. Kid is allowed to hate camping. He had no choice in the matter and didn't know what he was getting into. Next time he'll be able to say, yeah, i hate camping I'd rather not go.

I hope your brother does the right thing and keeps you away from him in the future. Yta 100%", "ESH", " YTA", "YTA. When I was a kid I hated this kind of things, like camping and hiking and now they are some of most treasured memories. Especially when I remember people who tried to make me see how cool it was. I don't hold good memories when my fear of encountering a dead body in a lake (yes I know it might be stupid, but I have seen a rescue on TV and found out that people drawn or are killed and not found for days) were being dismissed and I felt so alone for not being comforted by any adults. I sat on the edge watching my aunts sunbathing and chilling while casting me out as an odd kid for not wanting to go in the water even though they didn't go in either. \n\nIn conclusion, your kid or not you make an impression on children you interact with. You help them create memories and knowing that you are a parent you should know that. You don't know what this kid had in his head. I am not the most patient with children, but I had taken nieces of my bf on the side and tried to understand why they were so sad while site seeing. You know why? Because it was the first time in big city and they wanted a Starbucks cup to go like all the girls in the movies. It could be stupid to parents, who dismissed them when they pointed out Starbucks multiple times.

He complained he couldn't poop without a real toilet. \n\nThose are all valid complaints imo. And also the reason why I never go camping. Thing is, I'm an adult, and I can choose whether or not I want to go. If y'all dragged this kid to go camping, I don't really blame him (lord knows, when I was a kid, I had my obnoxious moments, and he's quite young).\n\nNone of this is 100% shitty behaviour imo. He's a kid being a kid and having a bad day. I don't know if I'd even consider him that ill-behaved, unless he called people names or was blatantly rude. Complaining the whole time? Whatever. \n\nYTA because you seem to be judging him very harshly for what I would consider normal kid behaviour.", "YTA for the way you handle the situation.

For kids a 2 year age gap puts them in different developmental stages. Kids are not like grown ups, everything happens sooo fast for kids that a 2 year age gap is a lot.\n\nAnd also way to encourage him to want to go camping again. I always loathed having to go out in the forest because I was scared of bugs and didn't know how to go to the toilet in the forest and no one taught me. I learned to use the toilet outside because I was drunk at 15 years old and had to take a piss. But yeah blame the kid instead of being understanding and teaching him.\n\nI am 24 and still very mich uncomfortable being outside because of grown ups acting like you when I was a kid. I want to want to go out into the forest but it is so anxiety inducing becuase no one helped me when I was a kid. NO ONE.

Yes, yes you are. Honestly, you're the asshole just for the title alone (you implied he's a little shit to his face).\n\nYou could have acknowledged his (VALID) feelings and telling him these are the things I like about camping, do any of these interest you? Or telling him that camping isn't for everyone and it's okay to not like it - now he knows and he can try again in a year or so. Instead, you dismissed his feelings completely and, according to your post, were just completely annoyed by him. Part of that, I totally get because listening to someone complain during an entire experience tends to ruin it for the group. But he's A KID.

No restroom facilities? No AuntiKrist.", "This! SM this. All the adults made the DECISION to go camping and the kids HAD to go! OP YTA", "The only problem with what you say is how do you know if you like something if you never try it? Sometimes part of being a kid is trying things that you\u2019re scared of and learning that you can conquer those fears and move past it. And sometimes it takes trying something a couple times to enjoy it. Man, if I stopped the first time, I tried anything because it was new or scary I would\u2019ve never accomplished anything in my life.\n\nThat being said OP, YTA. He\u2019s nine years old, giving him a positive memory out of this camping trip may have been the thing that would turn the corner for him enjoying going out with you. Or maybe it wouldn\u2019t but at least he would feel like he\u2019s connected and part of the family. I always laugh when people expect young children to behave like adults. Part of your job is to nurture and develop those behaviours in them.", "No.  Not everyone gets something.  Op is right, why punish everyone because one kid is an ungrateful shit.", "I'm with you. My parents would take us camping when we were kids, and I had the same feelings toward it as this kid. I wasn't as vocal about it, but I did spend most of the time in the tent reading (it was the mid-90s, so no phone, tablet, or laptop). The year my parents said I was old enough to stay home by myself, I jumped the chance. Now, at 43, I can say with absolute certainty that I will *never* go camping again.", "Oh sorry, OP YTA, but I don't think consciously or maliciously, to be fair.", "No, you are right, of course there was nothing to be done about the realities of camping. The kid got moody over it, the situation was not ideal, it happens.\n\nOPs behaviour in the gift shop and adressing this kid as a \"little shit\" makes me assume he was rather dismissive.\n\nJust to be clear, I am 100% sympathetic to how the kid might have been really annoying and exhausting at the end there. I still don't think OP, as the grown up of the sitaution, acted right and this is a YTA.", "You acknowledge and help them find ways to cope with it. Sometimes a simple \"yeah, I hate that part too!\" goes a long way. My 9 yo can be having the time of his life and still find things that bother him about it. If he's genuinely miserable, a little gift can make all the difference too, because there is finally a positive in that crappy situation. \n\nI'm a full grown adult with the ability to turn down a camping trip. This is a small child who didn't get a say in the matter and got punished for not sucking it up and dealing with it the way OP thought they should. That's dismissive and definitely YTA territory.", "Since it was the new kids first time,  the adults should have told them what to expect from their trip. OP is YTA for not doing this to start with. Only an AH would take a bunch of kids, who had never been in the wilderness, on a camping trip without telling them what to expect.", "They could have been sympathetic.", "You can at least be sympathetic and acknowledge that the kid has a right to not enjoy something instead of describing him as a whiny little shit.", "Keep on mind your daughter was raised by someone with little empathy or tolerance, so she is going to likely repress how she expresses herself to avoid being penalized.\n\nYou act like this kid was flinging poo, cussing out old people and spiking the punch.\n\nHe was a 9yo doing something  he didn't want to do for an extended period of time, and probably won't ever want to because of childish adults.", "I agree. If some of the kids didn't want to go camping, they could have stayed at home with Mom. If they wanted to come and it turned out, they hated it, lesson learned, they won't go again. \n\nI'm curious, though, where was your brother during the meltdown?  It was obviously a cry for attention, and his father should have taken him aside and had a conversation with him. At 9, he's old enough to understand the concept of \"I'm sorry you're not having a good time, but we have to make the best of it, so you can't keep acting out.\" Your brother staying quiet only condones the behavior. \n\nAs for the gift, I understand your reasoning. You weren't going to reward bad behavior, and you shouldn't. Your brother could have very easily bought that gift himself. \n\nOP, I'll probably see you in downvote land, lol.", "So you could have left it at telling him you weren't having a good time with his whining without keeping him from at least getting something good out of the experience.

Seems your just mad he doesn't like camping.", "My parents were professional speleology instructors when they were young. I've been going on mountain hikes since I learned how to walk.

And no, I'm not being dramatic. YTA.", "You realize girls mature much faster the boys, right?  Comparing him to your daughter at the same age doesn't work because your daughter was more mature you were basically expecting a 9-year-old boy to behave like an 11-year-old boy.  Comparing him to how your daughter acted at age 7 would have been better.", "Yup! Honestly OP saying those ages aren\u2019t different developmentally annoyed me the most, it just screams ignorance.

YTA", "are YOU 9?", "All you're doing is arguing, so guessing you posted your story because you're not too sure of your choice and want some validation. And you're not getting it.

Take your judgment and move on. YTA.", "Oh wow, on top of our collective empathy for your nephew- I sincerely and truly feel bad your daughter and wife had to watch you be so narcissistic and malicious towards another child. Or, maybe they\u2019re used to you doing that. Either way, YTA.", "Kinda notice that but point is, if OP knew that his brother forced the kid to join the trip.

I literally hate everything this guy did with the 9yo and how he treated him. The way he talks about that specific kid is like he got one look at him and just decided to be annoyed with everything he did no matter what and didn't try to be understanding at all. But to call the older boy deciding to cook horrible food slave labor is way way outta line. I do take issue with that phrase myself. Nothing sounded like they forced the boy to make supper.
