I used to be a top customer of this artist though, getting a new tattoo once every 2 months for about 3 years. My husband liked their work so started going to them too, but he was already basically covered in all the places he wants to be so he\u2019s slowed down now too. So I\u2019m not sure if me slowing down has an impact on prioritization of clients or not but this is definitely something I\u2019ve never experienced with this artist. \n\nI made an appointment for two pretty small tattoos (would take maybe leas than an hour to do) and my husband was going to get a free touch up that was offered to him on the same day. This was made in November of last year and was supposed to be for mid January. \n\nThe day came and that morning she told me she made some error in scheduling and couldn\u2019t get me in so would need to reschedule. I was fine with that. It was just a few days after that she rescheduled us for. That day came and she claimed she was just having a odd day and asked if we could reschedule again for the next week. I said yes because I want the tattoo and shit happens. \n\nThen the THIRD date comes up, and only a few hours before again, she says she had something else come up and would like to know if we can reschedule again. This time I was kind of irritated because each time we\u2019ve been getting a babysitter for our daughter so we can go to the appointment together. which I know isn\u2019t her problem, but eventually I feel like we\u2019re gonna run out of luck and not be able to find one and then WE will have to reschedule, and I can see this easily turning into a really frustrating cycle. I get sometimes stuff happens and just doesn\u2019t work out how we expect, but I was just a bit fed up so I told her I\u2019ll just let her know when I feel like I\u2019m ready for a tattoo again and that I didn\u2019t want to reschedule at this time. I wasn\u2019t rude about it I don\u2019t think but I was definitely blunt and not using a bunch of smiley faces and hearts when talking to her like I usually do. So I guess she picked up on the mood shift. The issue is she\u2019s also been taking other appointments and posting them etc and has been consistently tattooing other people. Some who\u2019s tattoos would take more than triple the time to do me and my husbands. \n\nShe told me she values me as a client and started offering up a bunch of dates she has open, but I still declined and she expressed that she felt like she upset me and didn\u2019t intend to. I told her I\u2019d just like a reset and will come to her when I\u2019m ready, which she accepted but in a way made me feel guilty still because of the tone in which she accepted it (sad faces, trying to make promises in order to get me to pick a date, etc). \n\nI have no hard feelings and I hate taking someone\u2019s income away by cancelling appointments like this.

You are a customer. You were understanding at first that changes do occur. Three times is a ton and it's your right to look at other providers.", "NTA\nYou didn't take anyone's income away. She did when she canceled three times. If she valued your business so much, she wouldn't have canceled multiple times. Find a better organized tattoo parlor.", "NTA - there's a saying: \"familiarity breeds contempt\". The artist probably feels like you're very loyal customers and won't mind all the changes. \n\nI would've mentioned the babysitter to them, but either way, you're well within your right to not go to them again.", "NTA. She doesn't really seem to care about your business, and suspect she rescheduled you to take larger jobs which she would make more money on. Now that she is likely in a slower period, she wants your business (and money) again. If I had been treated like this, I wouldn't be returning to this person again and would be going elsewhere.", "NTA - even the artist knows she\u2019s doing bad business", "NTA And if she is over booked to the point that she needs to reschedule this often, she isn't losing any income from your canceling. (If she keeps putting off your tattoo, she's never going to get paid for it anyway.)", "NTA. She clearly doesn't value your time anymore.", "Definitely NTA. 3 times is a lot of times to cancel on someone in a row. You\u2019re not obligated to go to her, and while she may be trying to reassure you and make sure you\u2019re not upset, it\u2019s a little late for that. You weren\u2019t mean or ugly to her, you didn\u2019t write her terrible yelp reviews. You just declined to get cancelled on again for more expensive clients.", "NTA most places have cancelation fees I would be interested in if she would be charging you if you were the one to cancel. Once i understand but even the second one I would be thinking she found a different client with a higher priority level.", "NTA. I had a similar experience with a tattoo artist but she still owes me money from last year. To run a business, you have to be organised and by the sounds of things\u2026 this tattoo artist isn\u2019t organised, or is possibly struggling in some way with time management, communication and commitment, not your fault at all.", "Ugh, frustrating! NTA. Has also happened to me as a fellow tattoo person i have also experienced a similar fuck up. Not all tattoo artists, but some can be a bit disorganized with apts. Also i feel like if they owe you or it's not big money, they seem to put you on the back burner.", "NTA. She values you as a client but not as much as she values the prospective clients who were gonna get larger, more time consuming and more expensive tattoos. Strike three and she\u2019s out as your tattoo provider.", "NTA. You're worried about her losing income, but YOU are the ones losing money by hiring a babysitter three different times and still not getting in.", "NTA", "NAH. She cancelled three times for unknown reasons, and you have every right to say \"hey, this isn't working right now; let's try again later.\" It sounds like she's recently had a deluge of new customers she's juggling, or something is going on in her life that you don't know about. As you said, shit happens; therefore, neither party is an asshole.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It may be that she is really shitty managing her time and she is blowing off smaller tattoos for the bigger ones. May just be time to move on and find someone else.", "Yes! My husband wanted her to at least touch up the tattoo she did on him instead of asking someone else though  because it\u2019s just tattoo etiquette to do it that way.

One cancellation okay, two fine, but three? Nah thats just unprofessional.", "Oh, gotcha. Still, you rearranged your schedule multiple times and gave many chances. I don't think you need to feel bad about \"cancelling\" (is it even cancelling when you don't even have a real appointment anymore, because it's been moved so many times?)/", "Oh definitely! I\u2019ve been eyeing my brothers artist up a bit for the past few days as he and my husband both suggested I do (my husband isn\u2019t as loyal to her as I was so he was fed up before I was and was already scouting new artists after the second reschedule)."]}
