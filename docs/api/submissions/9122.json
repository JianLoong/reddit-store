My husband liked their work so started going to them too, but he was already basically covered in all the places he wants to be so he\u2019s slowed down now too. So I\u2019m not sure if me slowing down has an impact on prioritization of clients or not but this is definitely something I\u2019ve never experienced with this artist. \n\nI made an appointment for two pretty small tattoos (would take maybe leas than an hour to do) and my husband was going to get a free touch up that was offered to him on the same day. This was made in November of last year and was supposed to be for mid January. \n\nThe day came and that morning she told me she made some error in scheduling and couldn\u2019t get me in so would need to reschedule. I was fine with that. It was just a few days after that she rescheduled us for. That day came and she claimed she was just having a odd day and asked if we could reschedule again for the next week. I said yes because I want the tattoo and shit happens. \n\nThen the THIRD date comes up, and only a few hours before again, she says she had something else come up and would like to know if we can reschedule again.

I get sometimes stuff happens and just doesn\u2019t work out how we expect, but I was just a bit fed up so I told her I\u2019ll just let her know when I feel like I\u2019m ready for a tattoo again and that I didn\u2019t want to reschedule at this time.

I run my own studio, do everything myself, and have ADHD which makes scheduling one of my challenges. Sometimes I have to reschedule an appointment because I\u2019m ill, have a very bad mental health day, or some type of emergency (for example, last week one of our cats got sick and I had to take her to the vet). Never EVER have I rescheduled an appointment three times in a row. Unless it\u2019s a dire emergency, I wouldn\u2019t even reschedule twice in a row. Of course life happens, and sometimes people have really bad luck. But that doesn\u2019t sound like it with the vague reasons your artist gave you. It seems she\u2019s moved you to the back of het priority list because she can make more money with bigger appointments, and that is inexcusable. That\u2019s not how you treat your clients, especially not those loyal to you. I\u2019d find another artist if I were you.\n\nEdit: forgot my verdict, sorry! Definitely NTA", "Super NTA. She is the AH. Especially when she posts other tattoos that are more detailed/took longer than what your stuff would have been. Don't fall for that trap.", "This reminds me of someone's mom who had this happen. Lol. Rescheduled 3 times, all hours or a day before with some shit excuse(and the artist had months of waits for bookingsand she had to manually rebook herself each time, not even guaranteed). Didn't respond to emails or voice-mail and essentially  gave a passive aggressive deal with it response when she did. Never gave a reason.", "NTA. She's repeatedly rescheduled a regular customer at the last minute. This is how you lose repeat customers. As others have said, tell your artist straight up that her rescheduling impacts your schedule and childcare arrangements, and feels like you just aren't her priority anymore. \n\nI understand loyalty to your artist, but there's a point where it's like a friendship and the other person isn't even trying anymore. I'm sure someone else would appreciate your money.", "NTA. \n\nAs a hairstylist who is an independent contractor, here's my input on why she may be cancelling on you but still working on others. \nSmall tattoos that don't take a lot of time don't provide enough income. She's doing the larger pieces because she needs to make money. Doing a small, less expensive piece AND a free touch up in the same day will hurt her income for the week. Try scheduling separately. She still has to use product, clean her tools, prep her station, etc, for a fraction of the income she would make on a bigger piece. She'll have to do all of that prep work and cleaning before and after both of you which will take up a considerable portion of her day. Or she could do it for one person and make a lot more money. \n\n\nThis is VERY relatable to my job. The only reason my vote isn't NAH is because I don't just cancel existing appointments when I'd rather make better money for the day. If I don't want to do something, I will find a polite way to say it without wasting a client's time and energy. This is one of the reasons why I don't offer kids cuts openly. All the work for a fraction of the income.", "YTA mildly.  By the time she asked you to reschedule for the third time, you should have been direct.  \u201cThis is the third time in a row you\u2019ve rescheduled with little notice because you are having scheduling problems.  We\u2019ve hired a sitter each time and had to pay them.  No we don\u2019t want to reschedule again.  Our time is important too, we expect you to honor the appointment.  If you are simply unwilling to work on us, be truthful and say so.\u201d\nI bet if you cancelled on her 3 times in a row with little notice, she wouldn\u2019t give you another appointment.", "Exactly, especially if it\u2019s a shorter amount of time so she doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s as tough to work around. That doesn\u2019t excuse her behavior and she probably immediately realized she crossed the line when she got your response. \n\nIt\u2019s totally up to you if you want to try again, but I\u2019d suggest reaching out and letting her know you like working with her but you felt frustrated by the recent situation. Whatever you decide to do you\u2019re NTA and if nothing else you\u2019ve taught her an important lesson on not taking existing clients for granted", "Even if that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s still wildly unprofessional. It\u2019s a service provider with a schedule that has been booked in advance. If OP had canceled the day of, only hours before the appt, I can almost guarantee that the artist would not be happy bunny and OP would potentially lose part of/all of their deposit. If I were OP, I\u2019d schedule husband\u2019s free touch up and see if the artist keeps the appt. before even considering booking with her again."]}
