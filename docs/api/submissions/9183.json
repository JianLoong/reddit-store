Maybe they're introverts and loved having more down time not socializing with or around strangers.\n\nI would sit him down and ask what, precisely, did he miss about the lockdowns.  Emotionally, in particular.  Maybe it means he really craves a big change in his life and was able to experience that change during the lockdowns.  But he may not know what it even is.\n\nIf your discussion with him goes nowhere, I recommend he talk to a therapist about this to see what it is exactly that he craves and had during lockdowns.\n\nBut you should not be imprisoned in your own house for six weeks to appease him.", "NTA, is this for real? Yeah lockdown had it's upsides but mostly for middle aged adults with good secure jobs who were able to work from home. Not so much for everyone else. I guess your husband falls in that first category.", "NTA, this is just odd.", "NTA-  I would be concerned for him as well.  If he feels that wearing masks, non in-person  interaction with people outside of his immediate family and hoarding TP was fun,  then there is an issue.", "NTA you told him that you don't want it and he should respect your decision instead of pushing his wishes on you , what you could do is just talk about it, why he wants to  rp it ,maybe  it's a deeper problem or feeling within him , maybe he saw the time differently than you , because of some reason . Just talk and ask where this feelings come from , if it has a deeper background.", "NTA. Lockdown was not an easy time for a lot of people, especially young people, so for him to want to relive this when it was so difficult for both you and your daughter is worrying.\n\nI'd sit down with him and ask is it the family time you spent together that he's missing, and if it's that, find a way to do more together without resorting to the extreme of literally reliving a time when the country ground to a standstill.\n\nIf its not that, he may need some help cos that's definitely not normal.", " NTA \n\nTo each his own I guess, but forcing you and your daughter to relive lockdown is unrealistic", "NTA,\n\nSounds like he is having a mental lockdown and yes he needs some professional help.", "What the hell.\n\nNTA.", "NTA I wouldn\u2019t want to relive that either.

Jesus, we weren't even allowed to go to the pub!\n\nHaving said that, as someone with a mental illness myself (schizophrenia), there were aspects of lockdown that were appealing. Not having to take hours to mentally prepare myself to interact with people, having shopping delivered, there was a few things about lockdown that made life easier for people like me.\n\nBut if he's *not* mentally ill, this is worrying behaviour.

I worked home from my first job and they had to make so many adjustments to work virtually.  Now we are all used to it even though we go in the office one day a week.

I've found myself weirdly nostalgic about it recently and wanting to pinpoint it. I know my partner and I had a really easy lockdown and I also know I'm glossing over the very real fear. I think for me what I miss is that brief sense of everyone in the country really being in it together (before we realized how much it highlighted inequalities like who has garden access, green space nearby, safe relationships, etc etc.) And for a little time it really felt like the government was looking after us and looking out for us. At the moment things in the UK are HARD, inequality is soaring, prices are soaring, it feels like we're pitted against each other and there is absolutely NO sense of the government giving a shit.
