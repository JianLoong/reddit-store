So behind my house is a small neighborhood park that has a basketball court. My house is directly behind the hoops. So an absolute ton of basketballs get thrown into my yard. This led to a bunch of kids always coming to my door asking me to get their balls. If this happened once a day I wouldn't mind so much, but it happens multiple times a day.\n\nWorst part is that it happens usually around the time when I am in my home office working. I have sometimes have appointments with clients that I need to talk to uninterrupted. I also have other paperwork to get done and don't want to interrupted my work flow just to get some kids basketball.\n\nSo I put up a sign on my front door that said I would not be answering the door during this time, but would go pick up any balls that landed in my yard and leave them on my porch once a day in the morning. Well various people have not been happy with that and want their balls back right away. Mainly my next door neighbor whose kids use the court a lot.\n\nThe first day I didn't answer the door for her kids she came over and pounded on my door. I went to see what was up because I thought it was an emergency and it was just my neighbor hulking out about the damn balls. Since she's so angry I refuse to open the door and talk to her through the door. That pisses her off even more. I tell her I'm not talking to her unless she calms down. She sort of lowers her voice. Then she's says I have no right to keep her kids balls. I tell her I'm busy and doing work. She says since it only takes a minute to go and get their ball and her kids ask nicely I should just do it. Even though it happens multiple times, so it's not just a minute.\n\nThere is also an issue with the balls I leave on my porch being stolen by other people. My neighbor says that since I'm being a dick and not getting their balls right away I am responsible for them and I need to buy replacements. I said its her problem and she can talk to the city about installing some kind of net around the hoop.", "created_utc": 1677606460, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11eexc7/aita_for_only_picking_up_basketballs_that_get/", "score": 106, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My Dad bought a new car and parked it right under the goal while we took my Mom\u2019s car to the mall one day. Got back and the driveway was full of folks.

One of the courts around me has a 12 ft fence around it.  Helps a lot.", "NTA. This isn't your problem. Contact the park and ask your neighbor to do the same. This is annoying. I got new neighbors with kids under 10yrs old that put up a hoop facing my fenced backyard. Since they were short girls and a very young boy, not a lot went in. I had 8 doorbell ringings the first day, the first waking me up. I was nice 2-3 times, then told them that I'd get them when I get them. They bought lots more balls, and their dad eventually turned the hoop to face the other way.

NTA", "NTA, but I think you should ask the park to put the net around the hoop. It's your yard that experiences the problem, it's your responsibility to get the town to fix it IMO. Additionally, your complaint holds a lot more weight. Her complaint is, \"My kids have to wait to get their basketballs back until the next day and that's inconvenient.\" Your complaint is, \"The quiet enjoyment of my home is being disrupted, as well as my work day, because the town didn't properly fence in the basketball hoop in the park.\"", "Good on you for returning them promptly, many people would just throw them away.\n\nIt\u2019s tough on kids when they don\u2019t have a lot of room to play.

Why not just give the neighbor kids permission to grab their balls when they go over the fence?

It's their balls, so they have every right to trespass any property even if it means to  destroy said property. /s", "When I was a kid, there was this man who bought the house right across from a park. When a ball would roll unto his front lawn, kids would get their balls and he would yell at them for walking unto his front lawn... He was so mean (this is not the only thing he did.) Backyard and front yard are 2 different issues.

That's what I was thinking, put a net on the top of your fence to help keep them out, also maybe a gate so ball retrieval is self service.", "Similar situation. My husband had an inexpensive portable basketball goal that we kept inside our fence and down the driveway toward the back of the house. Someone at the road wouldn't have even known it was there. One day we came home and found kids had gone into the yard and dragged it out to the street to play. Nope. Husband installed a permanent goal set in concrete. He dragged the other one out and gave it to the neighbors. Then we got a bigger lock for the gate. Fortunately the rather feral kids have grown up and moved away. I thought it was pretty darned generous of my husband. It wasn't the way I wanted to go. OP is definitely NTA for coming up with a solution and sticking to it.", "So you want OP to put the time, money, and effort into setting up a net in his yard just for the putpose of catching balls? How big does this net even need to be in order to do a reasonable job, anyway-are you considering how this will affect how OP can maneuver in his own yard and how much space he will no longer have by setting up a large net? Not to mention he'd still have to collect all the balls anyway and hand them out to each individual kid.  This is an unreasonable thing to suggest to someone.", "I really don't want to put any money into this or have people poking into my yard.", "Its a good suggestion, but Im positive that the net would get broken right away with so many people usint it and its kids, who are not the gentlist.

Setting up a net or some other retrieval device is going well above and beyond that. I don't think you're really considering juat how this is going to work out. There's a bunch of problems with your idea. \n\n1.) His backyard is behind the hoops. Which means basically the whole length of his fence is at risk of having balls thrown over it, depending on the accuracy of the kids. Sure, he can focus on the spaces behind the hoops, but that could still be a wide area depending on the size of his backyard. So you're basically suggesting he put something up along the whole line of his fence in order to collect these balls. \n\n2.) Not to mention, how far out around this net be? Every ball thrown over is going to have a completely difference distance it goes-some may land close to the fence while some may land close to his house. Does OP prioritize covering a large part of his backyard to collect more balls at the expense of not being able to comfortably walk around his yard? \n\n3.) Even a portable backatop would be a pain to set up and take down *every day*, and leaving it up is unsightly-very few ppl are going to want to deal with something like that in their yard. Who wants a big thing like that taking up space? And how much would it cost him to buy something like that? Not to mention he may not be allowed to set something like that up-if he lives in an HOA that's almost definitely out of the question.", "It works well enough", "You say that as if justifies them trespassing", "LOL, it's causing you so much strife that you are here asking if you are the asshole and you're beefing with neighbors - so with all due respect, no, it doesn't.", "I'm not saying it justifies it but they're going to start hopping your fence to get the balls back. \n\nBut again, if you sidnt want to deal with this sort of thing you shouldn't have gotten a house which backs onto a court. It's like moving near a music venue and complaining about the noise.", "Honestly, now I'm thinking it's going to be really hilarious seeing them try to get out if they do. I'm going to set up a camera.", "How would anyone know this situation would happen?  You are hilarious.", "You are really going to teach the neighborhood children a lesson", "How would anyone know that moving into a house backing onto a basketball court would end up with balls in their garden constantly? \nAnyone with a slight hint of common sense.", "I lived with a huge peck behind my house, baseball court and basketball.  I never got balls in my yard or very rarely did for 15 years.", "And you never had a right to complain about balls in your garden.", "I don\u2019t but I also don\u2019t have to fetch your ball for you all times of the day."]}
