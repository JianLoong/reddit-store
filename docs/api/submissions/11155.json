So behind my house is a small neighborhood park that has a basketball court. My house is directly behind the hoops. So an absolute ton of basketballs get thrown into my yard. This led to a bunch of kids always coming to my door asking me to get their balls. If this happened once a day I wouldn't mind so much, but it happens multiple times a day.\n\nWorst part is that it happens usually around the time when I am in my home office working. I have sometimes have appointments with clients that I need to talk to uninterrupted. I also have other paperwork to get done and don't want to interrupted my work flow just to get some kids basketball.\n\nSo I put up a sign on my front door that said I would not be answering the door during this time, but would go pick up any balls that landed in my yard and leave them on my porch once a day in the morning. Well various people have not been happy with that and want their balls back right away. Mainly my next door neighbor whose kids use the court a lot.\n\nThe first day I didn't answer the door for her kids she came over and pounded on my door. I went to see what was up because I thought it was an emergency and it was just my neighbor hulking out about the damn balls. Since she's so angry I refuse to open the door and talk to her through the door. That pisses her off even more. I tell her I'm not talking to her unless she calms down. She sort of lowers her voice. Then she's says I have no right to keep her kids balls. I tell her I'm busy and doing work. She says since it only takes a minute to go and get their ball and her kids ask nicely I should just do it. Even though it happens multiple times, so it's not just a minute.\n\nThere is also an issue with the balls I leave on my porch being stolen by other people. My neighbor says that since I'm being a dick and not getting their balls right away I am responsible for them and I need to buy replacements. I said its her problem and she can talk to the city about installing some kind of net around the hoop.", "created_utc": 1677606460, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11eexc7/aita_for_only_picking_up_basketballs_that_get/", "score": 294, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Which means basically the whole length of his fence is at risk of having balls thrown over it, depending on the accuracy of the kids. Sure, he can focus on the spaces behind the hoops, but that could still be a wide area depending on the size of his backyard. So you're basically suggesting he put something up along the whole line of his fence in order to collect these balls. \n\n2.) Not to mention, how far out around this net be? Every ball thrown over is going to have a completely difference distance it goes-some may land close to the fence while some may land close to his house. Does OP prioritize covering a large part of his backyard to collect more balls at the expense of not being able to comfortably walk around his yard? \n\n3.) Even a portable backatop would be a pain to set up and take down *every day*, and leaving it up is unsightly-very few ppl are going to want to deal with something like that in their yard.
