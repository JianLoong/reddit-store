{"id": 6181, "submission_id": "100gee4", "title": "AITA for not giving a stranger a ride home?", "selftext": "I (15 F) have a group of friends that like to go to dances together. Our parents carpool us because none of us can drive yet. We've been to several dances and have so far had a great time. A New Years dance came up, and all my friends wanted to go, but the parents were struggling to figure out the carpool situation. My dad volunteered to drive everyone home after, even though it would be running until 12:30 in the morning and he had to get up early in the morning. Our car has just enough seats for all of us, but we do also have a bigger car with more seating. My dad was going to bring the smaller car. We go to the dance and are there for only half an hour when a girl comes up to us and asks if she can hang out with us to avoid her friend because he is making her uncomfortable. We accept and are very friendly to her because this guy is trying to get us away from her and we realize he is a creep. Anyway, the girl brings up the fact that her only ride home is with creepy guy and immediately all of my friends are concerned, asking her questions about how far she lives and if her parents can come pick her up, etc. She says her mom cannot get her and she really hates the idea of riding home with this guy. She is very dramatic and asks us if we would be willing to give her a ride. All my friends are bugging me about it, telling me to just let my dad drive her. I refuse because I don't want my dad to have to drive any more than needed and this girl is a STRANGER, I'm not going to bring her with me. My friends are begging at this point, wondering why I don't want to and I'm very frustrated. They tell me to just ask my dad to bring the bigger car, it's not hard to do. They say she only lives 30 minutes away and if I cared enough I would drive that far. I tell them that a 30 minute drive is an hour both ways and that is too much for me to ask. My friend tells me that she wouldn't mind staying up an extra hour to help someone in need and I'm mad. I do text my dad, but he doesn't respond in time (thankfully), and the girl is forced to ride with her creepy friend.\n\nI feel bad for her, and don't want her to be in that situation, but she can't expect me to go out of my way for her. My friends were upset with me but I noticed none of them asked their own parents to wake up, get ready to drive over an hour (2 hours if they take all of us), and bring a stranger into their car,  just because they couldn't't get a ride from their mom. I found it hard to care much about what this girl said afterward. Why should I care so much about her situation? The back and forth carpool is a lot, taking an hour normally, and I didn't feel like I needed to force my dad to go out of his way. But perhaps I should have tried harder to be accommodating to her situation.", "created_utc": 1672566464, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/100gee4/aita_for_not_giving_a_stranger_a_ride_home/", "score": 554, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Would normally be leaning towards N-A-H, but as you pointed out, none of your friends were very eager to inconvenience themselves or their parents to help out this person.\n\nIt's very noble and understandable to want to help out someone in need, especially when it's a matter of helping someone avoid a blatant creep, but you can't make commitments on behalf of other people, and your friends shouldn't have pressured you into trying to do so.", "NTA, and your friend group sounds like they are AH as well. If they cared so much they could have called their parents to come get them and take the girl home. It\u2019s unreasonable to put all that on you and your dad when you were already doing them a favor by carpooling to begin with.", "NTA Your dad is staying up late on a work night for you and your friends. As a parent who taxis teenagers around, i can confirm that this is beyond generous. NTA for caring about your father's needs -  From what you say this girl's journey would have been an additional hour's driving for him. This girl should be contacting her own mother/family to arrange some sort of lift for her if she is in trouble, but it sounds like she was only looking at the easy option that was minimal effort for her. Your friends are TAs for not fully appreciating your father's generosity that allowed them to have a night out", "Going with NTA. Yes, it's true that the girl is in a very uncomfortable situation, but frankly, it isn't your responsibility to solve it, and being unable/unwilling to take it upon yourself to sort it for her doesn't make you the one in the wrong. Can't she contact her own parents and let THEM know of her situation? Your other friends trying to make YOU feel like the bad guy is pretty convenient, since THEY aren't the ones with any stake/responsibility.   \n\n\nThe bottom line is that it really isn't YOUR decision to make anyway. I think it'd be acceptable to ask your dad if he'd be willing to bring the larger vehicle and/or give her a ride, but it sounds like you did that but it wasn't soon enough for him to respond. That's the extent of what you're able to offer considering he's the one doing the driving. Maybe you put off sending a message until later so that you wouldn't force him to make that decision, but even then that wouldn't make you TA. You're not responsible for someone else, and if your friends are so concerned about the situation, one of them could've contacted their own parents to let them know about the situation or tried to find a solution themselves, rather than putting it all on you.", "INFO: Did you ask your dad at all? It isn't you going out of your way, it would be your dad going out of his way.", "Nta. Another solution would be chipping in for a taxi. That would\u2019ve been a safe alternative.", "NAH. it's horrible to have to be around a person that's creeping you out, and i personally would 100% have driven her home if i was driving. but i've also been a 15 yr old whose dad picked me and friends up from parties and stuff, and i also would not have wanted to ask my dad to make the extra trip. you handled this to your comfort level. it may not have been perfect, but it's worth something that you and your friends were able to recognize her discomfort and provide her with a better space throughout the dance. imo the best solution (depending on how your dad is) would have been to give your dad a full explanation of the situation and allow him to decide whether he was willing to take on the extra hour of driving or else find another solution or arrangement to help the girl. \n\nbut also, the main reason i'd recommend telling your dad everything is that i'm in my 20s now and i remember at 15, i just wanted to figure stuff out on my own and avoid bringing my parents into it... and honestly, if i had told my parents everything, they would have been able to find a better & more efficient solution to things like this in 10min than i'd have found in 2 hours. if your parents are decent, don't hesitate to ask them for help or guidance !!! it's not unlikely that they'd want to protect this girl as much as you and your friends do, and may have much better resources available to accomplish it !! \n\nfr though keep supporting other girls & protecting them as much as you can ! it's a learning experience for all of us & it's hard to know exactly how to handle stuff like this. and if you're comfortable with it, it may help to check up on her and try to let her know that you & your friends are in her corner \u263a\ufe0f", "NTA your friends volunteering your dad and trying to force you, to force your dad who knows nothing of the situation, is not on. If they were so concerned they could of pressure their own parents.", "NTA, agree with what most here have said. my only advice is if youre ever in a situation like this again, you could go find the event organizers and ask what options they have to help the girl since you cant. if you and your friends have the money, you couldve chipped in to get her a cab or uber.", "NTA, when I was younger, if I didn\u2019t have reliable transportation, I stayed home. She shouldn\u2019t have come out with someone she doesn\u2019t trust in the first place. What was her plan to start with? And if you were not there, how was she planning on going back home? There\u2019s nothing wrong with staying home if you can\u2019t trust the company you keep.", "Hopefully you\u2019re never in that girls shoes but if you are, hopefully someone isn\u2019t a selfish asshole and gives you the help you need. YTA, And I hope she got home safely.", "YTA. Going against the grain here if that girl\u2019s friend is truly creepy that is. Being a parent, I would much rather my child call & ask me upfront when they get this information. & as a parent I would much rather a girl get home safe & stay up later than I\u2019d planned, than something bad happening to her. You ultimately made the decision for your dad waiting so long & only texting him. Sounds like she\u2019s around your age & not some sort of weirdo stranger. She may have been scared & uncomfortable while you saw it as her \u201cbeing dramatic.\u201d She had to have felt uncomfortable enough since she asked strangers for a ride vs going with creepo. & your dad already committed to being the designated driver it wouldn\u2019t make sense for another parent to do it.", "YTA - at some point you will be in the same situation as her, and hopefully there will be better people than you around to help.", "YTA. I'm a parent. If my daughter had called and explained what she needed, I would have moved heaven and earth for her because she was standing up and protecting another human being. I pray that if you find yourself in a jam, a stranger will help you.", "You ever hear of that do unto others as you would have them do to you thing? I hope you are never in a similar situation, it would be really terrible if you ended up hoping for someone to help yourself and they couldn\u2019t figure out why they should care.", "Soft YTA - the girl needed help, if you didn\u2019t know what to do (which is totally fair because you\u2019re 15!) you should have called your dad and asked him for his advice.", "Soft YTA- Let me explain. I'm not saying that you had to give her a ride, AND, your 15, so you are still young...BUT to leave her there, without helping her find a solution means she will most likely get back into that car with that creepy guy. 1 in 9 girls under the age of 18 are sexually assaulted. You saw that that situation was creepy/dangerous. As a woman, you gotta look out for your fellow ladies. We got to stick together to keep each other safe.", "Soft YTA you should have spoken to your parent about if they the one driving opinion on it then say yes/ no to her based on the advice of the adult who is actually doing that task this is also coming from a parent I know both me and my kids dad would drive a hour even pull a all nighter too no questions asked to make sure a young girl got home safely and unharmed when her only way home is with a creepy guy. To be quiet honest I would be  extremely disappointed and frankly pissed in my children to straight away deny someone help and safety especially a young kid and especially a young girl on behalf of me without getting my input at all because as a adult and parent I couldn\u2019t imagine anything worse then my child immediately denying help on mu behalf without my input at all on the task that I\u2019m specifically doing and that other kid who was just needing help and safety get raped, assaulted or worse I just I would drive far beyond one hour to make sure she gets home safely. \nIn future get your parents on the phone asap and their opinion first if you can\u2019t go to another trusted adult because very terrible things can happen extremely fast especially to young girls and you\u2019re old enough to know that also personally I\u2019m not surprised your friends were pissy at you because you never know if they may have been assaulted themselves or in a similar situation and feel you don\u2019t have empathy for a young girl seeking safety like what if it was them etc etc", "ETA: I'd been unclear, hence my long list of questions below. In light of OP's answers, NTA.\n\nINFO (sorry, quite a few questions):\n\nHow long were you debating to ask your dad before you tried contacting him?\n\nAt which point did you text your dad with the request?  Like was it 5 minutes before he was due to set off to collect you, 30 minutes before? In other words, how much notice did you *think* your dad might get? (Yes, I've seen your comment he didn't see the message in time, but I am wondering he could potentially have got the message in time.)\n\nWhy did you text, and not call your dad?  Because a phone call could have better explained the reason your friends were all concerned for this girl's safety.\n\nWhat did you put in the message? As in, did you just put that there was someone else who'd like a lift if he could bring the bigger car, or did you explain that a girl was with a creep and needed a lift?\n\nYou've said the stranger couldn't get a ride from her mom. Do you know why? Had she not asked, had she not been able to get hold of her, had the mom not got a working car, was the mom at work?  The answer to this question makes the difference between the girl exploring other options or not.\n\nWhy didn't any of your friends try their parents if they were concerned?  Whilst your friends were perfectly happy to add 1hr to their journey, they were volunteering your dad to do this. And as for your friends trying to tell you to let your dad drive her, no, it would be ask your dad to drive her. But if your friends were that concerned, they might in theory have contacted their parents, though if they knew their own parents were working, would have been drinking and therefore not ok to drive, or would be in bed asleep and therefore not be available to answer your friend might be justified in not trying their own parents.", "I\u2019m shocked by the responses here. YTA. Something terrible might have happened to this underage girl. She was uncomfortable enough to ask you for help. She could have been sexually assaulted or murdered. And you just left her there when you could have asked for help?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

With her creepy friend? Did he drives? His parents? I don't get it. Why did she come with him, if she doesn't trust him? She already knew that she has to return with him after the dance??", "NTA. \n\nOthers have no right on agreeing to help someone when it is actually not in their ability to actually take responsibility of the situation. \n\n\nAs a parent I would have asked exactly the same questions - where are her parents, why did she take a lift with a creepy person in the first place, who decided to saddle me with the responsibility of driving an unknown child to an unknown destination. Many things can go wrong - I am not willing to take that risk on an unknown person.  Never mind you have a parent staying up late to accommodate you, adding an extra hour onto a journey is a lot.", "NTA. I\u2019m glad you helped the girl out by keeping the creeper away, but she probably should have gotten in an Uber or something instead of letting him take her home. I hope she\u2019s safe.", "NTA\n\nIf your friends were so concerned they should've ask their parents to take her home", "But the other parents weren\u2019t expecting to drive, whereas hers already were.

He asked me about it when we got home.", "Do you think a group of 15 year olds at a dance would have enough cash between them to pay for a taxi for a ride that's going to be around 30 minutes?", "Lol a selfish asshole is someone who pushes their problems onto strangers when they have their own parents they could have called", "Lol hoping that a 15 year old girl is one day in a dangerous situation because she didn\u2019t feel obligated to inconvenience herself or her father for a total stranger. Classic ignorant redditor", "What an ignorant take lol you realize this is a child you are talking about. She is not responsible for what happens to perfect strangers nor should she have to be.", "Lol seems like her friends weren\u2019t in a hurry to call their parents to come help either. Why would they when it\u2019s easier to shuck all of the responsibility on someone else while you still get to feel like you have the moral high ground without actually being involved at all. If they cared so much they wouldn\u2019t have minded inconveniencing their own parents", "Thank you for your questions because I think they might help a bit. I admit that I did hold off on contacting my dad for a while, but it was by no means last minute. The drive to where the dance was is maybe about 10 min and I did text at around 30 min in advance, though I'm not entirely sure.\n\nMy dad also tends to not have his phone near him at all times and it stays on silent always, so I doubt calling would have helped, because texting would last longer, and he would see it whenever he checked his phone.\n\nI didn't go into a bunch of detail about her situation, only vaguely saying she was in a tough situation and was needing a ride.\n\nShe didn't say anything about her father, but as far as I know, her mom was available because she asked me for my dad's number, saying her mom would need it if she got a ride. She did try contacting her mom but didn't say anything about that so it's unclear. She asked for my dad's number after messaging her mom, do I think her mom would have replied.\n\nI don't know anything about their parents but I do know that all of them were home. One friend couldn't contact her parents because they were preparing for a big trip (her brother was going off to college and they were going with him) and another family has a lot of family stuff, including young kids and a special needs daughter. The other two have no immediate issues. \n\nSomething else I think I should add is that this girl got a ride to the dance with this boy, and told us that she knew him well, he was even the one to invite her to the dance. One of my other friends apparently has her dad working with creepy dude's dad (crazy coincidence) and she contacted them about him (meaning her parents were definitely awake and watching their phones) and got this girl's number, I assume so that she can keep in contact if anything DOES happen. \n\nI don't deny that I should have helped her, but I feel conflicted about why no one stood up for me or why she didn't get her parents to help her.", "Or she could have chosen not to approach total strangers with her problems and reach out to the teachers, her parents, or her own friends for help like a normal human being.", "Lol I guess you missed the part where she has her own parents she can call if she really needed help. It\u2019s not OPs responsibility to have her dad drive strangers home when the girl could have just called her own parents. She\u2019s not Spider-Man here to right every wrong at the dance.", "As much as it is always nice when someone is willing to help you out of a bad situation even if they don't know you, it is entirely unreasonable to demand a specific individual to be able to accommodate you when you do not know them and have no previous relationship with them. Sometimes, people are just not in a position where they could feasibly be expected to help, and any reasonable person needing help in that situation will recognize this and keep searching for someone who is both willing and able to give the help they need.\n\nI've been in the position of being the helping person that keeps someone from dealing with a creep more than once, and I've thankfully never had to turn someone away when they asked something like that of me, but there have absolutely been times and circumstances where I simply would not have been able to give that kind of help, no matter how much I wanted to. Nobody can expect or demand that random strangers drop everything to get them out of a sticky situation, because if someone is an absolute stranger to you, you cannot have any idea of their own situation or circumstances that might prevent them from giving you the help you might want or need.", "But her parent wasn\u2019t expecting to drive an extra hour. NTA. Uber, taxis, her family, your friends parents etc etc could have all stepped up. This isn\u2019t the fault of a 15 year old girl.", "And, again, the girl was supposed to get a lift with creepy guy so her own parents may have been out & drinking. Getting an uncooked taxi on NYE is almost impossible. If the girl had ANY other choice she wouldn\u2019t have gone with him. I\u2019ve (f) stopped in the road before now to offer a stranger having a row with her boyfriend a lift. You were all together, so safe.", "I'm kind of inclined to NTA in that case, it isn't that you didn't try, you did, but there is a certain point where it isn't your problem, and you found it.", "A selfish asshole is anyone who sees someone in need, can help them but refuses to do so.", "That\u2019s clearly not what they said. You\u2019re the ignorant redditor here mate", "Obviously reading is not your strong suit - I said hopefully there would be better people around who would be willing to help, as because, most women do find themselves in situations where they need help from men who won\u2019t leave them alone.", "Yeah, the brainrot is real.", "classic on this forum.", "She is 15.  And was old enough to decide the guy was a creep, but not old enough to understand that even if she couldn\u2019t help it is shitty to say I don\u2019t know why I should care? That is brutal.", "Because your friends, like so many people in these comments voting Y-T-A know that it\u2019s easier to be outraged when someone doesn\u2019t do something they think should be done rather than do it themselves. No one else stepped up to take her home either and that alone should tell you everything you need to know about your friends. It\u2019s all about moral grandstanding without actually having to get your hands dirty or bare any of the inconvenience yourself. Don\u2019t feel bad, I think you did what you could and at the end of the day you didn\u2019t feel comfortable with what was being requested of you.", "Thank you for providing this. From what you've said you tried to help despite your reluctance, you had logical reason for contacting your dad the way you did, and you certainly can't take responsibility for that your dad didn't see the message before he set off in the smaller car. \n\nIt might be worth you adding this extra detail (or at least some of it) to your original post for clarify for those who could miss your response to my questions. \n\nHopefully the girl got home safely.", "That girl obviously didn\u2019t feel comfortable calling her parents. Who knows what her home life is like?? & who just leaves a girl stranded with a creepy dude? The least OP could\u2019ve done was called to ask her dad in time & let him make the decision.", "Nope, she had no obligation to this stranger and people like you who thinks it\u2019s okay to inconvenience other people with problems that you could solve yourself is what\u2019s wrong with the world. Talk about entitlement.", "I don't disagree with your base sentiment, but it falls apart when you require that someone offer help on the behalf of *other people*. Extreme extenuating circumstances aside, I would gladly give a complete stranger a ride to prevent them from having to interact with a creep, but I would *never* promise them a ride from someone else that I hadn't discussed it with beforehand.", "Nope that\u2019s exactly what the comment implied, seems like you can\u2019t read well either.", "No, what you said was, and I quote, \u201cat some point you will be in the same situation as her\u201d. Seems like you are the one with reading comprehension issues. Maybe think before you post in the future.", "Well if you had actually read the post you would know that the girl has her own parents she could have called if she was really that uncomfortable. Expecting OP and her dad to drive an extra hour is completely unreasonable when it should be the girls parents that come to handle any issues that arose at the dance", "dude. where the hell did she say she didn't care? it sounds to me like she empathized with the girl and cared enough to help her all through  the event, but was uncomfortable asking her dad to make the extra hour long drive at 12:30. that's definitely not unreasonable at 15.", "It doesn\u2019t matter if she felt comfortable calling them or not, her parents are responsible for her, not a 15 year old girl and her father.", "It was a dance for minors, if things were bad enough, she could have/should have asked one of the chaperones for help.  That's why they're there.  It is not up to a random 15 year old to fix problems she had no hand in causing, on the fly.  It's really easy for her friends and you to tell her/her father what to do, because neither you nor her friends have to actually DO anything.", "I\u2019m a father of four and I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to drive an extra hour to keep another kid safe from harm, stranger or not.  It\u2019s not entitlement, It\u2019s called being a decent human being.", "Yes - because all women find themselves in the situations where they are being harassed by men - as I mentioned.  I did not hope for that situation, because no one hopes for it, but our society has made it acceptable to harass women and it is up to all of us to ensure that they get a safe ride home.  Therefore I hope that there will be people who will help\u2026glad I could clear this up for you.", "If you had read, the girl said her mom was not available.  No mention of a father, maybe she doesn\u2019t have one. I guess the girl,should have realized ahead of the dance that her ride was going to be creepy in some way that was not explained in detail and not attended.  Clearly. \n\nThe issue I\u2019m having isn\u2019t with the OP not giving the girl,the ride, the issue is that she says she doesn\u2019t see why she should care.  If she really couldn\u2019t help, then why does she need reassurance about it? Fuck that girl.  Right?", "Good for you, but you do not have the right to make commitments on behalf of others. What is a reasonable ask and no major imposition on you might be impossible or a serious issue for someone else. Without intimately knowing someone else's situation, you cannot expect such things of them.", "It\u2019s absolutely entitlement. OP stated she was not comfortable doing it and that\u2019s that. If the kid was really in danger she had her own parents she could have called but only saw fit to try an inconvenience a stranger that she doesn\u2019t have any prior relationship with. It\u2019s not unreasonable that OP wasn\u2019t comfortable with it.", "She had literally no obligation to help this stranger and that doesn\u2019t make her an asshole. Why should she care? Yeah it\u2019s unfortunate but that girls lack of foresight is not an excuse to involve herself in OPs already made plans in regards to the ride home situation. She has already stated in the comments and in the post she texted her dad and he didn\u2019t see it in time.

Editing original post now\n\nI think the main issue is that the decision of what to do in this situation should have been made by a responsible adult (whether a parent, a chaperone at the dance, whomever) and OP, in a genuine and sincere attempt to spare her father some extra driving and sleep loss, took the responsible adult out of the equation and made that decision herself. That's where she messed up, in my opinion (which seems to be unpopular, reading through the rest of the responses). \n\nI don't think OP did it maliciously (\"fuck this chick, i don't know her and she gets what she gets\"), i think she was genuinely trying not to overburden her dad. She was trying to be considerate, knowing her dad was already doing her a huge favor that would mean he would be losing out on sleep. She didn't want to add to the burden, and i get that, and I'm sure her dad would have appreciated the intention.\n\nThat said, i have to believe that if OP had made her dad aware of the situation (\"hey dad this girl i don't know is super creeped out by this guy she came with and he's her ride home, she's maybe 30 minutes' drive out of the way, can we help her?\"), OP's dad, being a decent enough dude to volunteer in the first place to pick up his daughter and a bunch of her teenage friends from a NYE dance after midnight while knowing he had work early in the morning, would have at the LEAST figured out a way to get that girl out of that immediate situation. That might have been a ride all the way to her home, it might have been calling her parents and them coming to get her, it might have been a ride to OP's home and then meeting the girl's parents there -- who knows. But I have to believe something other than \"leave this girl far from home with a creep\" would very likely have happened. \n\nAnd, i can also imagine that if OP explained this situation to her dad today, after the fact, and asked him \"dad what if that had been me?\" he would have expressed a hope that those girls would have called someone and tried to help his daughter get out of that situation. \n\nI know the options are either YTA or NTA, but \"asshole\" might be a bit strong in this case. It could've been handled better, definitely, but I don't think OP was an asshole for it. Just a young person who didn't know better.
