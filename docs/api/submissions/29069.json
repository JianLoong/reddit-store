Stop helping her with her house and everything else because she is not grateful or appreciative of anything you are doing for her. Let the family friend do that as well. It is okay to remove toxic people from your life and she is a very toxic person. Just for your own peace of mind let her know that you love her and you care about her before you walk away. And loving her and caring for her are the reason you are walking away. You do not want her to go to her grave with you hating her.

My life was similar to yours now, just a few years ago. I took care of my Mom for many years with a very bad spine, and then in her final time with lung cancer. The way that my Mom made a horrible time more of a challenge was with little white lies; like, still sneaking snack cakes when she knew she had no choice but to lose weight or the surgery she needed would be delayed or denied. I can only imagine how you must feel, if your mother behaves as you describe, and still being the primary caregiver. In her final months, my Mom did and said some horrible things, and they did not make sense and were very uncharacteristically mean of her.

It is very possible that the cancer is spreading in your Mother's body, and it could even be affecting her brain.\n   It happened that way with me, for 2 family members.
