{"id": 29069, "submission_id": "179id3f", "title": "AITA for stepping away from my terminal cancer mother because of her actions?", "selftext": "I (34) have been helping my mom since she was diagnosed with cancer earlier this year; facilitating her bills, taking her to appointments, visiting her nearly daily, buying her things she needs, etc. Prior to her getting sick, I had not talked to her for 14 months, and before that very sporadically, because she is a manipulator, and a liar. I have three brothers, and \u201cFamily Friends,\u201d but not a single person has offered to help. I understand why no one wants to get involved with this, because while dealing with a parent/family that has cancer is very hard, dealing with *her* is a total nightmare. Just to put this in context, at 12AM my eighteenth birthday I left home and I didn\u2019t talk to her for five years, because she abused me when I was a teenager. Since re-establishing a relationship, the verbal and emotional negativity returned, so I kept her at arm\u2019s length. \r  \nShe is now stage four \u2013 terminal - and at a full-time care facility. I have been spent the last three weekends, and more than ten weekdays (after a full-time job), cleaning and prepping her (hoarded) house as we (she and I) are putting it on the market to finance help for her until the end. \r  \nI have tried to do the right thing, taking care of my parent during the end of her life, but her abuse has been prevalent through this whole process. She is now more stable without treatments, but she consistently lies, to me, to doctors, to the realtor, it never ends. I caught her in lies to the realtor the other day, saying I was forcing her to sell her house, when the whole thing was her idea. When I was driving her back from an appointment a month ago, she ranted about what a failure I am (because I am divorced, unmarried, without children, and not thin enough \u2013 she\u2019s been divorced five times). One time she tried to grab the wheel while I was driving and crash us into the median. These are only a few of the things she has done in the last nine months.\r  \nI told her I have had enough. I have cut down visiting her to once a week, and once her house is sold and a facility is paid for, I will no longer be taking her to appointments, running errands for her, etc. We got into a fight because I told her this, and I am so honestly done with her that while she was crying, \u201cNo one cares for me,\u201d I didn\u2019t even blink. I told her that was true, but her actions led to that, and I do not have any more sympathy for her.   \nA family friend told me I am being unreasonable, and I should tough it out, because she is dying, as if she is not in control of her behavior, but I think she is just being her, with no filter or care for who she hurts.\r  \nI have given up my mental health to care for her, not to mention time, money, everything I can do and give to help her. I am plagued by thoughts that I am being a complete a-hole by stepping away from her, which leads to endless crying and sleeplessness.\r  \nAITA for stepping away, despite the fact she is dying?", "created_utc": 1697494376, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/179id3f/aita_for_stepping_away_from_my_terminal_cancer/", "score": 37, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Excuse my language but that self righteous \u2018family friend\u2019 should either f*** off or walk a few miles in your shoes. You are not an Ah for stepping back from a woman who would drag you down to hell with her if she could. And you have been the only one of her children to step up.  Protect your health and your sanity. If you have to, petition Probate Court to appoint a guardian to handle her financial affairs.", ">A family friend told me I am being unreasonable, and I should tough it out\n\n\"Feel free to take over. Otherwise, keep your opinion to yourself.\"   \nNTA", "NTA and you're morally justified. I was the sole person in my emotionally/verbally abusive mom's life while she was dying and it was so hard. I can empathize with what you're going through and I'm sorry. \n\nMy advice to you is to examine what will be most traumatic for you after she passes. If you step away now and never see her again will that haunt you? If you step away and only see her when she actually passes, will you be okay with that? Etc.? It's your choice and you should do what most protects your mental health and wellbeing.", "NTA \n\nI had a similar mother.   You've done a hell of lot more than I would have so well done.", "NTA. You\u2019ve done what you can. If you can live without regrets, then you\u2019re good. Parents are family but not all parents deserve respect. Your mental health is just as important. See about free counseling for caregivers and see if that helps at all.", "NTA, you don't need to be anyone's punching bag, ever.", "NTA.  Care giver burnout is a real thing - I know from personal experiences.  That your relationship with her has been at best rocky, it\u2019s time to leave her to make her own decisions.  In the meantime, talk to a social worker if you can find a decent one.  If you live in the US, the state could take her home and sell it to cover her care.  Chances are that they would sell it below market value.  Also see if you can get a free short consultation with an attorney.  Outstanding debt can often be the obligation of the children which sucks given your relationship with her.  Present those facts to your siblings.  This is only a suggestion to CYA as you have done so much already and don\u2019t need to be burdened anymore.  You have reached the point where you need to protect yourself so that you can go on and live your best life and not have guilt.  \n\nHoping you can get through this without anymore damage to yourself.  Wishing you all the best!", "NTA. Your first duty is to yourself. Then a long list of possible others, and Mama who abuses you and tries to kill you both is not on that list, not even at the bottom. Remember that. You don't owe her help and if she actively lies and mistreats you still, it's best if you don't give her any. Stay away.", "NTA. But I don't think it was beneficial to tell her that you'll be done with her, when the house is sold. Now she has an incentive to drag things out. Learn the art of not talking on yourself. Withhold what you need to, for your own peace and to get what you need to get done.", "Nta. She sounds physically and mentally dangerous. She could get you into legal trouble if someone takes her allegations seriously. \nJust help her but try to always take a buddy or someone w you as a witness.", "Having a terminal illness does not automatically make someone a saint and excuse bad behavior.", "NTA. Her having cancer is not a jail-free card that erases all the abuse. You owe ger nothing. \nTake care of yourself and your mental health.\nShe made her choices and now has to libe with the consequences.", "NTA", "NTA. You're not being unreasonable, your feelings are valid, and that family friend is an AH. Just because she is your mother doesn't mean she deserves your sympathy, especially after treating you that way and doing the things she is doing. You have every right to preserve your mental health, and you have done the best you can with what you were given. It was up to her to show some damn courtesy and grattitude in her time of need since she is, you know, dying. But she failed to do so, and that is how she is choosing to be remembered. This is nobody's fault but her own.\n\nAlso, I'm so sorry you have to deal with that, and I hope you are doing okay.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I am so sorry for you having to deal with this.  I would urge you to take care of yourself and make sure that your actions from here on out are in your own best interests, including making sure that you don't regret any choices you make regarding her.  If that means full no contact, so be it.", "NTA. OP- I do recommend you get yourself into therapy though as dealing with a terminal mean parent can wreak havoc on your mental health.", "NTA, and I'm going to say something crass. Your mother is going to die either way. You've given up enough of yourself in this process. There's no reason for you to give any more. You allude to having siblings and family friends and we all know why none of them are helping. You have done more than your share.", "NTA\n\nYou have done far more for her than I would have. She doesn't deserve your care just because she is your mother. Family should treat you better than strangers not worse. Let her die alone in that home. It sounds like it's what she deserves.", "NTA. No absolutely not. You're dealing with burnout from two separate things here.\n\nFirst one being the cancer - I'm sorry you're going through this, it's always tough.\n\nSecond, from the mental abuse. While certain cancers (brain etc) can change how a person acts, this doesn't sound like she is any different to how she has always been. \n\nThe fact you have done so so much for her when literally nobody else will step in shows how much strength and courage you've actually got. As such, because you're at the point of burnout, you need to do what is right for your mental health and sanity. You've done enough OP. \n\nShe made her bed. You do not have to lie in it.", "NTA.\n\nI am deeply impressed by your response of \"she was crying, \u201cNo one cares for me,\u201d I didn\u2019t even blink.

From your description, You seem to have survived a really horrible situation (with your mom) and I admire your strength.\n\nPlease continue to be your own best friend - you seem to have a great sense of who you are and what is and is not in your own best interest.\n\nStay loyal to yourself! I wish you the very best.", "Please reach out to a nonprofit hospice.   They can coordinate her care.   I'm so Sorry you're going through this!", "No you are not the a****** or being unreasonable. First tell the family friend to step up to the plate and take care of her instead of telling you to suck it up. Walk away from her now. Stop helping her with her house and everything else because she is not grateful or appreciative of anything you are doing for her. Let the family friend do that as well. It is okay to remove toxic people from your life and she is a very toxic person. Just for your own peace of mind let her know that you love her and you care about her before you walk away. And loving her and caring for her are the reason you are walking away. You do not want her to go to her grave with you hating her. You want her to go to her grave with you having open heart,  mind and soul. This will also bring you the healing peace for when she passes away. Then let everyone else deal with everything that needs to be done for her because you already put in your time for over 9 months, without any appreciation or thanks. I think you have gone above and beyond for her and now you don't have to help her anymore sunshine xoxo", "I asked a friend the other day how his Mother was and he replied that he had no idea .Or know where she is.His mom was terribly abusive and he finally walked away from an ill , very old woman .I do not judge my friend  or you OP .NTA.Narcissism does not mystically go away just because a person ages .", "NTA You have been setting yourself on fire to keep a narcissist warm.
