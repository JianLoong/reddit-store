I have been her step mom for 6 years. I love my step daughter and think she is a good kid. For instance, she\u2019s polite, in the top 5% of her class, doesn\u2019t get into trouble, helps with house work proactively and is extremely compassionate, probably more so than the average teenager is at 16. She has her eyes set on being valedictorian.\n\nThe thing is with her, is that she\u2019s only had the same steady group of friends (2-4 other kids) since elementary school, which is fine. But as opposed to doing what seems normal among kids her age, she is perpetually upstairs in her room on her laptop, For the past three years I have watched her actively decide against going to prom, home-coming, any party or outing even with her own friends etc. She doesn\u2019t wear makeup, she dresses extremely homely in exclusively sweat pants, and outside of going to school everyday, she doesn\u2019t leave the house. Like I said, she does have a handful of friends who come over sometimes. Teachers have said in the past that she is polite to them but quiet and prefers to work alone. She doesn\u2019t socialize well with the other kids and I\u2019m told she is bullied for a speech impediment. Even when her friends are over she just sits in silence.\n\nThe other day at the dinner table I offered to take her on a shopping spree for her birthday to get some more adult makeup and some clothes, and it took some convincing but today after school, we went. I mentioned to her how nice it would be to get dolled up together for thanksgiving at her grandparents and she told me it\u2019s not really her thing but that she would try and dress up a little. Naturally, she picked out a giant turtle neck that was 3 sizes too big and swallowed her whole. It wasn\u2019t what I had in mind but a step in the right direction, so we got it and left.\n\nIn the car on the way home I asked her what she thought about going to prom this year, even just with friends just to make the memories and have the photos to look back on, and she said she has no interest in that. I tried to ease into the conversation and verbatim told her:\n\n \u201cLook, you\u2019re a really pretty and smart girl and I\u2019m just worried that in a few years you\u2019ll have nothing to look back on. You aren\u2019t making the memories or connections that most other girls your age make, and I think that maybe if you just put in a little more effort into yourself and stepped out of your shell a little bit, you could easily be your absolute best self. You could be so much more popular if you just tried.\u201d\n\nShe immediately started crying and asking me what I thought was wrong with her and why I thought she was \u201cthe worst or something\u201d and no matter how much I tried to explain, she just wouldn\u2019t stop crying. When we got home, my husband hounded me and told me I was just contributing to what she already deals with at school, when I personally felt like I made good points and articulated them in a healthy way.", "created_utc": 1668125308, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yrw01o/aita_for_saying_my_step_daughter_could_be_more/", "score": 135, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your kid doesn't WANT to interact with a bunch of abusers and bullies. She clearly wants to do her time and get out. That's, sadly, pretty common with school and how many passes bullies get at school.  \n\n\nYou can express that you hope she can do some of the stuff with her friends away from the bullies, have a private Prom or something? But it's clear you do not understand how terrible her classmates are.", "YTA, you gave unsolicited advice because your step daughter isn't living her life the way you imagine she should. She has good grades and a core group of friends. I don't know why you want her to be more outgoing, seems like she has a good life already.", "YTA, the prom, home coming and stuff like that just isn\u2019t important in the grand scheme of life.

She's a good kid, she has a group of friends and she makes choices. She's not interested in getting all dressed up and using makeup...that's her choice. She doesn't want to go to prom...that's her choice. If she's a good kid and content with what she's doing...lay off. You did essentially tell her something is wrong with you. That she's not normal. No wonder she started crying. If she came to you asking for help then you talk about some of these things with her. Don't try to change how she is now. You also should have been addressing the bullying and her speech troubles (does she need a speech therapist?) instead of trying to make her into your ideal popular teenage girl.", "YTA. Not everyone peaks in high school. She\u2019s got plenty of time to make friends and memories, and it sounds like she\u2019s doing just fine right now. Leave her alone.", "YTA-are you even serious? At that age I had a small group of friends and spent a ton of time on my laptop. And I was happy. You\u2019re projecting what you think is an idea of a fun time and acting like she\u2019s not good enough when she\u2019s just being who she is. Who gives a shit about being popular? I\u2019d rather have three genuine friends than a bunch of surface level ones. And if she doesn\u2019t want to go to homecoming\u2026who cares??\nThis was completely uncalled for. No no no.

She didn\u2019t ask for your help becoming popular, and now feels judged as lesser than by someone she felt she could trust. You\u2019re not loving her for who she is, you\u2019re loving the vision of what she could be, and that\u2019s purely terrible parenting. You should have kept your mouth closed and allowed her to be happy on a shopping trip she wasn\u2019t aware had shitty undertones.", "YTA- you basically told her that she's a weirdo and then you are wondering why she started crying? News flash- being the popular kid in high school is not necessarily something to strive for. If she's quiet and prefers to be at home then maybe she's just introverted and you are bullying her because she doesn't meet your very gendered and stereotypical norms. You should apologize profusely.", "YTA, I didn't go to any school dances, wear any makeup, and only had 3 friends, but they were and still are the best friends I could ask for. Just bc your step daughter isn't doing the things you think she should, if she's happy, what does it matter? It's her life, and if she wants to spend it chilling, I don't see a problem.", "YTA- I was a quiet kid in school. I went to events like prom and I had a great time, BUT she hasn\u2019t shown much interest in it and that\u2019s okay. High school is incredibly tough, especially these days with social media, the last thing she needs to hear is that she needs to do extra things and \u201cput more effort into herself\u201d to be the best version of her. \n\nShe puts a lot of effort into school and getting good grades. At the end of the day, would you rather her be a great teenager with good grades or a teenager that\u2019s out covering her face in make up in order to feel confident enough to leave the house, and is out partying every weekend? \n\nIf she is happy with what she\u2019s doing, why try to change it?", "YTA. Who are you to decide what would make her high school years more fulfilling.  Is she complaining about not going to prom?  Is she complaining about not having more friends?  You are acting like the bullies she tries to avoid at school.", "YTA. You sound like you peaked in high school and you\u2019re projecting. I never went to homecoming or my senior prom. All these decades later, I have never once thought gee, I wish I had homecoming pictures to look at! \n\nYou didn\u2019t make any good points. You made purely superficial suggestions and come off as extremely shallow. \n\nIt might be a foreign concept to you but not everyone\u2019s life goal is to be popular.", "YTA. Leave the poor girl alone. If she is happy with her life then that is all that matters, you aren\u2019t living it. It almost sounds like you want her to do what you think she should so you could live vicariously through her.", "YTA - If she's not interested in \"conforming\" to social standards and being her own person, why are you pushing her to be something she's not? Good for her for not being a follower who is worried about being in the popular crowd.   \n\n\nIf it were me, I'd take a hard look at why it is so important for me that my child be popular.", "YTA Way to teach her what is completely unimportant about high school. I\u2019ve reconnected with other \u201cpopular girls\u201d and you know what? High school was a misery for all of us. Leave her to be a genuine great person. I\u2019ve raised two children who had great high school years that they quite happily left behind in pursuit of even more happy lives.", "YTA. Why are you so worried about her popularity?", "YTA. It\u2019s nice to be concerned, but at the same time it\u2019s her life and her comfort. She has her group of friends, does well in school. I don\u2019t see why she needs to change or \u201ctry\u201d more. If you force her into doing something or changing herself just to fit in with the \u201cpopular kids\u201d instead of having nice memories of this time, she\u2019s going to hate it. As long as she has good friends, good grades, and is comfortable with herself. That\u2019s all that matters. You should be teaching her to be happy being herself.", "YTA - stop trying to push your values onto this kid. Nothing in your post makes me think she cares one whit about \u201cbeing popular\u201d. There is nothing wrong with that, just because you valued things like a dress up dance doesn\u2019t mean your step-daughter should and there is nothing wrong with that.", "Yta. You chose to bring something up she\u2019s made no indication bothers her.", "YTA. Are you actually interested in what your stepdaughter wants or are you just projecting your personality and interests on to her?  Have you considered that perhaps she might truly not be interested in being popular? There is nothing wrong or abnormal about that. Not every young girl needs to be obsessed with dressing up, wearing makeup and being one of the cool kids. You may think that she won't have anything to look back on during her high school years but prom dances and parties ARENT everything. She has friends, she enjoys working hard in her studies, and I'm sure she has other hobbies as well. What are her hobbies? Her interests? What is important to her? \n\nAdditionally, you acknowledge that she has been bullied for her speech impediment by kids in her school. So, why would she want to be friends with them? Would you want to go out of your way to be friends with people that have made fun of you or watched you as you were mocked and bullied? \n\nYou should be thankful that she is so well-behaved and focused because so many parents can't say the same. \n\nAs a teen I didn't go to prom. I didn't go to formal. I didnt go to parties. I was an introvert but I had a small group of close friends and plenty of hobbies that I was passionate about.", "YTA she has no interested in those things, why are you forcing them upon her.", "YTA. You're acting as if her life is over when she is done high school and that if she doesn't live her high school life up to your expectations, she is a loser. \n\nNot everyone peaks in high school. Some people really metamorphosize when they leave for post-secondary, or even later. Who are you to judge her timeline, or what makes her feel comfortable?", "YTA What a load of superficial bs.   How many friends, popularity, clothes, getting dolled up none of that stuff is important.  You should not be allowed to be advise her.", "YTA\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of things in this story that make my blood boil.\n\n1. For you to really complain that she is always in her room despite her being top 5% of her class, being an amazing student, and being such a kind person and most likely many other things is insane. Having 2-4 close friends is great and that\u2019s good for her.\n\n2. Why do you care anyways? Who cares if she isn\u2019t really into makeup or prom or whatever like okay? Let your daughter be herself. She seems like an absolutely amazing person and just because she doesn\u2019t fit into your box on what she\u2019s \u201csupposed to be\u201d does not mean she is not just as perfect as any other person.\n\n3. You need to be appreciative of your daughter. She does not IN ANY WAY have to be popular or have many friends to be a great person. To say \u201cshe dosent try\u201d is absolutely insane. Your little box on what she\u2019s supposed to be has got to go or else you and your daughter are gonna have some problems.\n\nMy advice try to be more open minded. Your daughter dosent have to like dresses or be popular in any kind of way. She simply is just a more introverted person who clearly dosent like big social events and dosent deserve to be scrutinized for that.", "YTA.", "YTA! Let her live her life! She'll have better memories doing things her way than being miserable trying to chase popularity she doesn't even want.", "YTA - do not vicariously live through your step daughter. She doesn't have to like doing what you did. I hated all that crap too and I don't regret not going to parties or formals or any of that. That wasn't my thing. If i had gone I'd have been miserable. \n\nBe happy she stays out of trouble, takes school seriously and isn't concerned with popularity. It means nothing when school is over. You've made her feel like crap for being her. It'll take a lot of qork on your side now to fix this huge mistake you made.", "YTA\n\nShe is a great kid and you are trying to change her into what your ideal is.

Who cares? Makeup doesn't make you a better person.", "YTA - she doesn\u2019t have the same priorities as you and you need to stop trying to force them on her. If she later regrets choices she made then oh well, she will need to find ways to deal with it, but she obviously isn\u2019t going to enjoy herself if she goes to these events and does these things, and then later looking back on high school she will just remember how miserable she was.\nA small group of close friends is a wonderful thing. If she\u2019s happy with her friends then she doesn\u2019t need to be popular. She sounds like a great kid who is an introvert - why can\u2019t you accept her? How awful that her stepmom who claims to love her is obviously only interested in changing her.", "Yta.....please let her form her own life and what she is comfortable with.", "YTA.\n\nHigh school is not a popularity contest. Neither is life. The girl has all these good traits as well as some friends that she enjoys and yet you want more from her. Let her do her thing by wearing that turtleneck and becoming valedictorian while you focus on getting all dolled up so you can look popular and feel thankful for thanksgiving.", "YTA. You have a shy, probably introvert teenager,  with all the hormones going through, and she has her friends that she likes,  and her own ways of interaction with friends. You turned round and implied that there is something wrong with the her behaviour because she hasn't tried to be like something you think is correct. \n\nAs a teenager, I was similar to your step daughter,  except I did go to parties with friends and stand there being quiet. I was happy to talk to someone 121. I always worried I was weird. One of the best things someone ever said to me was that as the person being quiet I was the most interesting person in the room because noone knew what I was thinking. That is what you should have instilled in her. She gets to be her.\n\nIf she actually has a massive depressive issue or some issue all you did was amplify how wrong she's doing it. As step mum, and actually worried you could have tried to talk to her about any underlying concerns.\n\nMy interpretation here is that she didn't have the outgoing personality you expect of a 'successful ' teen, and didn't want to engage in the things you see as important for a teen. Maybe she just doesn't want to.\n\nWhatever her approach you were so awful and definitively the AH.\n\nEdit: I had to add that it makes me so angry you did this. I doubt she'll ever forget what you said, and I hope you can live with her having to deal with what you did to her acceptance of being herself.", "YTA.  Why does it matter to you if she's popular?  If she's happy you shouldn't make her feel bad about herself becausecahe isnt living up to your expectations.   This might come a surprise to you but, not everyone peaks in high school.", "You're going to get a lot of YTA's.\n\nAnd I think you're too hung up on societal norms, if she doesn't seem depressed then what's the problem? Yes, too much alone can be bad, but you said she has tight group of friends, why is that not enough for you? It's okay for her to be different than what you consider the \"social norm\" and not want to go to all these parties, proms and outings. If she doesn't want to dress up or wear makeup, then so be it! She might change her mind later on, or never, she will find her crew and be okay within that.", "YTA. I had an aunt like you growing up. Now I\u2019m 31 with endless issues from shit like this. Leave the kid alone and let her be her own person.", "YTA, she clearly has her own interests, What do you think It's \"normal\" It's something she has no interest in and doesn't like, she's living life her own way, not the way you think it's cool for a 16 year old girl. Also, 1-4 friends is pretty nice? It's much better to have a few good friends than a lot of empty friends. And It's not me talking, there are studies that show that, popular people grow up with a lot of problems, and People with few friends but with a lot of intimacy are satisfied. Btw She's happy with her life and you shouldn't try to change it.", "100% the asshole", "You would have been fine if you stopped at the first sentence. Nothing wrong with saying you are worried she will regret missing out, but everything else you said was a complete dumpster fire.

She reads books, doesn't she? Why not a shopping spree at the book-shop?", "YTA", "Damn I\u2019ve had to rewrite this comment so many times because there\u2019s a lot there. \n\nYou know that she\u2019s been bullied - that can very much explain why she\u2019s so quiet and introverted. Except that kind of stuff requires councilling, not a \u00abjust try harder\u00a0\u00bb talk\n\nShe doesn\u2019t want to go out. Yeah I went out with my friends a grand 6 times in my whole high school years because I find parties overwhelming and too socially draining. Doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t have good memories of high school. Her being on the computer might be her way to socialise and spend time with her friends without draining her social batteries. \n\nHer not wanting to dress how you wish she did and not wanting to wear makeup are also not bad things. If you want to take her shopping to satisfy your desire for a certain type of step kid, you\u2019re doing it wrong. You know it\u2019s not her thing, that\u2019s fine. \n\nTh\u00e9 comment about how she could be popular \u00ab\u00a0if she tried\u00a0\u00bb did in fact imply that how she is now isn\u2019t good enough.

Leave her be! Parent to child that you have, not the one that you want to have", "I don't see anything healthy about telling a teenager who is bullied at school that she just needs to change herself and try harder, and then people will like her - that's victim blaming, and you have no good points.  YTA.", "YTA, If I was mom I\u2019d be concerned too, but to equate her showing no interest in going out and socializing to how she looks was totally off base.  The way she reacted to your comments is very telling.  I am not surprised but it speaks volumes about how she feels about her life.  If she decides to speak to you or her dad again it can be an opportunity to help her explore her feelings about her life.\nTherapy seems needed and hopefully wanted!", "YTA. So what if she doesn\u2019t wear makeup, has a small group of friends, and dress homey. Would you rather a child dress sexy?", "Here's a memory for her: her step mom pushed her to do something she really didn't want to do for HER birthday then bullied her because step mom thinks that she's not good enough. At least you got your wish on giving her something to look back on. YTA", "YTA \n\nI'm the much older version of your stepdaughter. I like my life just fine. As long as SHE is happy, that is really all that matters. Some humans are just less social, it's really ok. I have zero regrets about skipping prom and such. I have a small group of very close friends and that's plenty. I actually prefer it that way. Hell, my style of clothing is even similar. I haven't worn makeup in I don't even know how many years. It's just not important to me. \n\nYou really need to stop trying to change her. She is not hurting anyone. Just because you think those things are important, doesn't mean she has to or will. Let her be who she is.", "I don't think that you meant any harm by what you said, but if it seems like it was important to you for her to be more popular. It isn't to her. She may be introverted, or she may have some self esteem issues. Why don't you instead find out what interests she has and support them? What is she doing on the computer in her room? Is she a gamer? Maybe you can encourage her interests instead of putting your ideals onto her. If she is struggling with bullying, she may benefit from some therapist visits.", "YTA - First, not all children (or adults) are obsessed with popularity.  She wants to be valedictorian!  Her studies are the most important thing to her.  You also mentioned she has a few long term friends from grade school.  These are the best kind of friends to have; it's much better than having a large amount of acquaintances.  \n\nSecondly, as for liking clothes that are too big for her, a lot of girls have body image problems or if she's if she's large breasted, she might feel more comfortable wearing larger clothes. Additionally, lot's of girls hate having to spend the time putting on makeup in the morning and taking it off at night.  Actually, there is a new movement growing of not wearing make-up. A women in the Miss England pageant went bare-faced and ended up being one of the finalists in October.  \n\nOne thing to note, you have mentioned that she is isolating herself.  Isolating oneself is sometimes a sign of depression especially if she is isolating from her friends.  It's something that your husband should try to talk to her about to see if she needs help.  I think it's better for him to talk to her than you because you might be part of an image problem if she has one.  You talk about her not doing \"normal\" things and about how she dresses \"extremely homely\". You seem to be obsessed with how she looks, not who she is.", "I know you mean well, but YTA. She sounds a lot like me in high school, except I only had one close friend. My mother pulled the same thing on me that you did to her, at one point screaming at me, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you have any friends?\u201d The hurt from that comment never went away. What you need to do is keep loving and supporting her as she is instead of trying to change her. Chances are that as she gets older, she\u2019ll start building close friendships. In my case, the friendships and popularity came when I was in college and I grew into the person I really was instead of trying to measure up to other people\u2019s ideas of what I should be. I bet that will be true of her too.", "You mean well, but boy, YTA!!!  Your stepdaughter is introverted and that's OK! She doesn't need to be \"popular\" to be happy.  If you want to help her become \"her absolute best self\" then love and support her interests, don't knock her down because of how she dresses or how many friends she has.", "Soft YTA. Not all teenagers focus on makeup and clothes or put the same value into that as you do.  This generation is also much more open to being who they are, and not necessarily wearing tighter fitting clothes or makeup. I think the better approach would have been to indicate that you\u2019re available if she does have interest makeup and clothes, but this has a cringey view of a stepmom trying to make her (step)daughter into a doll, or superficially focus on being \u201cpopular\u201d.", "YTA- I had a step \"mother\" just like you. 'Why don't you have more friends, let me dye your hair blond, let me buy you ugly clothes that you hate'. Let the girl be herself and stop trying live vicariously through her. You aren't her mother and you aren't her friend. Stay in your lane, being a young woman is hard enough without your meddling.", " YTA. You absolutely did not have good points, nor did you articulate them in a good way. You basically told her she's not good enough and needs to be someone entirely different from who she is. I feel so sad for her. She'll go the whole rest of her life knowing you don't love the person she is and wish she could be someone she just isn't.", "YTA. You sound like the stereotypical bully from every 80s teen movie ever.", "YTA and ew the worst kind of \"mom\" . It really is ok if she doesn't want to wear make up or go to dances.

She has her eyes set on being valedictorian.\n\nThe thing is with her, is that she\u2019s only had the same steady group of friends (2-4 other kids) since elementary school, which is fine. But as opposed to doing what seems normal among kids her age, she is perpetually upstairs in her room on her laptop, For the past three years I have watched her actively decide against going to prom, home-coming, any party or outing even with her own friends etc. She doesn\u2019t wear makeup, she dresses extremely homely in exclusively sweat pants, and outside of going to school everyday, she doesn\u2019t leave the house. Like I said, she does have a handful of friends who come over sometimes. Teachers have said in the past that she is polite to them but quiet and prefers to work alone. She doesn\u2019t socialize well with the other kids and I\u2019m told she is bullied for a speech impediment. Even when her friends are over she just sits in silence.\n\nThe other day at the dinner table I offered to take her on a shopping spree for her birthday to get some more adult makeup and some clothes, and it took some convincing but today after school, we went. I mentioned to her how nice it would be to get dolled up together for thanksgiving at her grandparents and she told me it\u2019s not really her thing but that she would try and dress up a little. Naturally, she picked out a giant turtle neck that was 3 sizes too big and swallowed her whole. It wasn\u2019t what I had in mind but a step in the right direction, so we got it and left.\n\nIn the car on the way home I asked her what she thought about going to prom this year, even just with friends just to make the memories and have the photos to look back on, and she said she has no interest in that. I tried to ease into the conversation and verbatim told her:\n\n \u201cLook, you\u2019re a really pretty and smart girl and I\u2019m just worried that in a few years you\u2019ll have nothing to look back on. You aren\u2019t making the memories or connections that most other girls your age make, and I think that maybe if you just put in a little more effort into yourself and stepped out of your shell a little bit, you could easily be your absolute best self. You could be so much more popular if you just tried.\u201d\n\nShe immediately started crying and asking me what I thought was wrong with her and why I thought she was \u201cthe worst or something\u201d and no matter how much I tried to explain, she just wouldn\u2019t stop crying. When we got home, my husband hounded me and told me I was just contributing to what she already deals with at school, when I personally felt like I made good points and articulated them in a healthy way.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The few times we went to the parties, it wasn\u2019t fun because kids are jerks (as your stepdaughter knows).
