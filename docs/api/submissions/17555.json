Did yall shell out thousands in unrefunded fees that don't go to equity?  Did you do the work of finding a house?  Of the bidding wars?  Of the paperwork?  \n\nPay in half the closing costs first and then we'll talk about if rent can gain equity.  And even then, you know how little of a mortgage bill actually goes to equity?   People would be getting fractions back in \"paid out equity\".   Much less than they expect.\n\n----\n\nETA\n\nI just looked at my mortgage payment for the month.  It's roughly $1100 a month with only $372 going to the principal.  Say they paid $550 rent (which is BS because that doesn't include repairs and such but whatever).  If the average equity gain per month the person lived there was $372 and they stayed a year before break up, they'd get $2232 back.  But if they want equity they should have paid in the same fees.  Take the fees, divide by 30 for a 30 year mortgage, then multiple by the years they stayed there.  $10k/30 = $333 they'd owe in \"fees\" to get the equity.  So like $1899 back in max.  Then subtract half of all maintenance done during that time (those getting equity pay towards repairs).  $1900 is about right for half upkeep and repairs for a house where I am.  Some years I've spent as little as $2.5k in upkeep and repairs.  Some years I've spent $20k in repairs and upkeep.  $5.5k seems like a good average across my like 6 years in my house.  That would be $2,750 owed in on average.    \n\nCongrats, you've either broken even or owe more.  In my scenario someone would owe in another $851 and get nothing back in this \"equity\" building time.  \n\nThis is why people that demand equity (meaning they also are making themselves responsible for upkeep that maintains that equity) don't make any damn sense to me.  It takes at least 5 years before fees and such are less than the equity you build.  Dating someone that has a house isn't an easy way to use them to get around the fees.

Sometimes there are lender requirements that also cost money, like a buyer paying off extraneous credit card debt. \n\nLastly, we don't know what kind of potential liability they had for child support, supplemental taxes, liens, judgements, solar transfer, HOA fees, etc. which are all required to be cleared up and paid off during the sale of the home. \n\nSelling a house is not cheap, and frankly, it shouldn't be because it's a challenging process with many financial and legal implications for multiple parties.
