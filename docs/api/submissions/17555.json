If I have more than one property (like my old house in TN) then I'm required to pay more in taxes. \n\nI had to prove (write a letter) that I was going to live primarily in SC so my taxes were 4%. If I hadn't they were gonna charge me 10%. I sold my house in TN so it became a non-issue.\n\nHowever, if OP is going to own 2 houses in a state like that it's probably going to affect the taxes.", "Idk what area OP is in but it\u2019s mostly been a seller\u2019s market since covid. People are struggling to buy homes because they keep being outbid by each other, to say nothing of corporations monopolizing as much real estate as they can. I\u2019d say her odds are good.", ">  Just think of all the money you will save by not having to invite your family to the wedding.\n\nExcept her father was paying for the wedding and is no longer doing so.", "After sales commission, taxes, and whatever fees are due, she may not even make a profit. The father could, at least, support that she asked for enough to break even. But no, they want a huge discount that would put OP at loss. And this without even knowing if the Uncle will qualify for mortgage, given his credit history.", "Wah wah wah go cry about wailing family someolace else.", "I honestly agree. I don\u2019t think OP is an AH for not doing it, but I do think that probably is the right thing to do. Especially if OP can afford to build a home. Personally I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth the family drama either. Also if they have tons of debt can they even finance a home. Why can\u2019t OP continue the rental arrangement?", "Why should he have to pay it forward? Is that a law? How does that work?", "For not wanting to take a $30,000 loss when selling the house?  You happen to just gift any of your extended family $30k when you were 31?", "adding on to that...the fees involved with selling a house can be astronomical depending on where you live.  I just sold my house for 690,000 and after fees, lawyers, title co, inspections. realtor commision I ended up with 630,000.", "If their credit is so bad, they may not be able to get a mortgage anyway.", ">another example of people acting holier than thou and demand charitable actions to be taken with someone else's money on the line.\n\nAgreed.", "What a ridiculous take.  She got that discount because of a personal relationship with the seller.  She is in no way legally or morally obligated to pay that discount forward.", "So? OP put a lot of sweat equity into the home and shouldn't be forced into selling their home at a lower price because her family made shitty financial decisions.", "You are correct. I'd do the math and prove the point. If OP were making a profit, consider the situation. If not, also consider it. Explain to family then. Facts are facts", "Very articulate\ud83d\udc4f", "Yep... I'm in the process of selling my house.  The house is great but the neighborhood, not so much.  When I go to closing, I'm going to have to bring a $6,000 check to cover the rest of the closing costs that the sale didn't cover.  \n\nThose fees really add up, especially if you live in an area with high property taxes.", "What's commission, 5% ?   If so that means you lost like $25k to bullshit fees.\n\nI was pretty fricking annoyed at the $6k-$10k in additional closing fees that I had to pay in order to purchase a house.   So many little licenses and title transfers that really add up.", "Just because you don\u2019t agree with something doesn\u2019t make it ridiculous. So explain what\u2019s ridiculous about it.  The OP has a personal relationship with her relatives too.  \n\nTBH. A 20% discount on a house is exceptional for any relationship.  But that\u2019s what the teacher supposedly gave her.  \n\nThere\u2019s nothing ridiculous about expecting her to pay something forward to people in need, when she got something when she was a need.", "OP got a $20k discount, and then put $10k into the house. Adjusted for inflation, OP paid $92K for the house originally, putting the breakeven for JUST the house itself at ~$102k (not factoring in any labour, time, or anything other than strictly the value of the home).\n\nYou\u2019re not actually suggesting OP should take a loss on the property as a \u201cgood deed\u201d, are you? \ud83d\ude02", "But is it your money to decide if someone is hurting or not? Go be broke someplace else.", "Commission is what the realtors get paid. If you do sale by owner you can skip that, but generally you\u2019ll get more and better offers with a realtor. The commission is how they get paid for their work.", "OP gave her relatives cheap housing and then first dibs to buy at a discount. Sounds like she's been pretty nice in my opinion.", "It depends entirely on the position the seller is in, maybe the teacher didn't need the money as much as OP does and was able to help. OP isn't wrong for not being in the same financial place as the teacher.", "But she also had to renovate the house plus there is the expense of taxes and mandatory insurance most mortgage companies require. $110,000 is a fair price especially what housing market is like, not to mention what rental properties are charging.  Just because their family doesn\u2019t mean she has to lose money on the house either.", "If you\u2019re going to adjust for inflation, then you need to adjust the amount she was discounted as well.  That\u2019s $33k.  \n\nAnd it\u2019s not taking a loss, because she lived in the home.  Honestly, the story sounds kind of cappish.", "\nI don\u2019t think you understand this sub. Take care!", "I dont think they were asking what commission is, I think they were asking how much commission the realtor took", "But OP never said she couldn\u2019t afford to give the discount.  So that argument is speculation."]}
