[Adjusting for inflation](https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm), that's now roughly $92k. Add in the $10k of work you've done (which you're probably undervaluing) and you're really close to the $105k you're offering. \n\nWill this argument go over with your relatives? Probably not, but it's a sound economic analysis.\n\nNTA.", "This is why you don't over-share information with people.  It's no ones business what you paid for it or why you got a discount.  They can look up on Zillow what it sold for, but you can easily say \"Yeah, it had \\[vague\\] issues that I repaired\" or other bullshit.\n\nNTA for asking market value, Y T A to yourself for oversharing with friends and family.", "NTA, you made a big investment in the property and not only costs to reno it, but also your time and energy. \n\nYour family is TA here if they're calling you greedy for trying to recoup your investment, and giving your family first option for it", "NTA. I have low tolerance for people who live beyond their means then want to play the 'but we're family' card to guilt family to basically pay for them living beyond their means. It sounds like You are financially sound not only because your teacher cut you a break, but because you have made good choices. They're not financially sound because they made bad choices. You shouldn't have to pay for their bad choices.\nEdit to add: The family members that are mad at you..ask them what THEY have sacrificed to help your aunt and uncle. That ought to shut them up.", "NTA people like that who call themselves family and think you get free handouts are the worst, you have to do what\u2019s best for you always and at least you know how quickly your family will switch up on you", "NTA. Of course you\u2019re not wrong for wanting market value, or close to it. You have to pay market value when building your new house, so it doesn\u2019t make sense to sell for less than what you could get from someone else, unless you didn\u2019t need the money. You are doing nothing wrong. Don\u2019t let anyone make you feel bad about it.", "IMO, no, not an asshole. \nHouses appreciate and depreciate in value. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair of them to ask you to do something like that. I have found that a lot of people are willing to make hardships a competition. You have debt and you have a way of lessening/eliminating that. You have to take care of you because no one else is going to put you first. \nNow, I do think if your current residents have literally nowhere else to go, that could change things. You should also consider the cost of selling a house if you\u2019ve never done that before. All the people involved do take away from that $110k. You could, depending on how pricing, realtors, lawyers, etc cost in your area, end up making less. Just some food for thought.", "NTA. Just think of all the money you will save by not having to invite your family to the wedding. Personally, I think weddings are a scam that leave you broken and poor. That aside, an appraisal is not an offer. You can set the price at any point you want. It\u2019s the offers that actually determine how much you can sell it for. And, there\u2019s some cost for you when you do sell. So, you\u2019re not actually getting all the money from the sale. You may barely break even when it\u2019s all said and done. Of course, you want to get as much for the house as you can, no matter what you paid.", "NTA if all of your relatives are so upset about this why don't they pay the difference? I bet not one of them would give up a $30k profit. If they can't afford the house at market value they can buy one somewhere else for the money they want to pay. I'm sorry your parents refuse to pay for your wedding as a result of this. Tell them they can give that money to your aunt and uncle if they feel so strongly about it. Money is the great divider! I have watched so many friendships and families implode over money. (Not mine cause I have no money)", ">My father is no longer paying for the wedding \n\nWell you have extra money from the house sale so you can pay for your own wedding. Win-win.\n\nNTA, but considering the economy now, if your realtor has been overly optimistic and you can't sell it for $110K then you will have broken some bridges with family over nothing. it's a risk.", "NTA - You are under no obligation to offer a steep discount in market value to anyone. That includes family.", "INFO: If they are so much in debt that they couldn't afford their previous mortgage, then what makes them think they could afford this mortgage? \n\nAs for your address, I don't know how owning more than one house affects where your mail is delivered. I have 2 homes in my name and I have my mail delivered to my primary residence. \n\nNTA. They can't get a free or drastically reduced house just because they are family. If your family is so keen on them having a free home, maybe they should pitch in to buy the house for them.", "NTA.\n\nThis is why it is always bad to mix business and family, IMHO.\n\nYour family expects you to get nothing out of the house, after you put your money and sweat into it? No way.  You already cut the price for them by $15k.  \n\nYou already did them a huge favor by giving them a place to live when they squandered and misspent their funds. If they can't see that you're already helping them out, but deserve to get some money from the sale of the house, fuck them. \n\nFamily helps each other, but family also doesn't get to just walk all over other family members just because they're related.\n\nLose the moochers, sell the house, pay off your debt, and have a wonderful, if smaller, wedding.", "NTA - You would be crazy to just give them a house, which is what they want you to do.  Their hardships are not your hardships.", "I would factor what you paid, Reno costs, time value, taxes, insurance, and interest. Those are all costs born. Then if that is less than what you are asking adjust accordingly.\n\nYou are NTA. But your family also gets to make decisions based on how you handle.

In fact its a sellers market someone may even pay you more than 110K for it if you ever sell up - let people outbid each other and get more if there is interest. \n\nIts insane not to expect a house to appreciate - thats why you buy houses as an investment and also inflation 100 dollars in 2020 buys less than it does today. \n\nJust look on online since 2020 the dollar has appreciated by 15% and the cumulative price change is a drop 17.21%. So something worth 100 dollars in 2020, to buy it today you would have to pay 117.2 dollars.

Upside!\n\nAs they have recruited outsiders into what should have been a 1:1 conversation between buyer and seller, your relatives have taken themselves out of the running for buying a house for *under* market value. You simply cannot do business with them, as you cannot trust them to behave in good faith.\n\n(And this is assuming they'd qualify for the mortgage anyway -- you did say these people have a history of poor financial decisions, and there's been sustained unemployment.)\n\nPut the house on the market and take the offer that works best for you.

Also add in that, I'd expect that given how home prices usually get quoted, 79k wasn't the *total* cost, but there were all the associated fees and what not OP would have paid when they bought, 105k is really *just* breaking even. NTA.", "But she was lucky to buy a 99K house for 79K. Her house is actually 99K+10K+ increase in inflation - and sure it might be valued at 110K but that doesnt matter if multiple buyers are interested and they outbid each other. Then you have lawyers fees etc", "That entirely depends on the area where you live. Houses in certain areas have gone for a lot more.", "Like if the dad was offering something in the 30K range for the wedding, then they may end up breaking even-at which point like they def should just sell lower and not break ties.", "I think it\u2019s kind of shitty, because her teacher gave her a massive discount.", "She offered a discount that is paying it forward. Paying it forward is a great idea, but you have to take care of yourself before others. She is getting married and has student loans to pay. Unless she is wealthy 30k is a huge amount of money. Why should she give away $30k then have to pay 6% interest on loans for 20 years?", "If they break even either way, I certainly wouldn\u2019t reward the people who bossed them around.", "I never suggested that she give away $30,000. I said $20,000, because that\u2019s the same discount that she got.\n\nShe could not have even afforded the house if not for that discount, by her own admission. So, I think it\u2019s shitty to benefit from something and not pass it onto ailing relatives.\n\nEdit:  where are the student loans?  She\u2019s building another house with her fianc\u00e9.  She doesn\u2019t appear to be hurting for money."]}
