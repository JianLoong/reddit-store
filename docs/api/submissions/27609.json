I have recently returned to working from home full-time, and can normally manage the care of our baby between myself and the grandparents. Mondays are especially tough as the company I own operates 24/7, however my working days are M-F.\n\nMy husband was away over the weekend for a big camping trip with the guys. No issues, I was all for it and didn\u2019t bother him at all. He returned on Sunday night pretty worse for wear, so I did the full overnight and morning shift with the baby to give him time to recuperate. Grandparents weren\u2019t available to step in at all.\n\nI log in for work on Monday morning and ask my husband to take over with the baby for the next couple of hours so that I can get some work done. He proceeds to swear, remind me that he\u2019s hungover and tell me he needs to rest.\n\nI snapped back and told him he doesn\u2019t get a free pass from parenting when he\u2019s hungover. He\u2019s trying to act like it didn\u2019t happen now and make small talk but my anger is through the roof and I cannot face him right now. He gave a half assed apology along the lines of sorry but I\u2019m really hungover. The mental load of working, parenting, and all the little household bits in between is so big it physically hurts.\n\nSome key points:\n- I have spoken to him about the mental load on many occasions and as recently as Friday, specifically about how Mondays are extra tough.\n- There has been a pattern of doing the bare minimum with the baby, e.g. giving him back to me because he can\u2019t settle the baby etc.\n- I am the primary income earner of the household which I know shouldn\u2019t bother me but I can\u2019t help but ruminate on how he doesn\u2019t support my work but will happily spend the money that comes in.\n\nAITA for giving the silent treatment?\n\nTL;DR: husband returned from a camping trip and woke up hungover.

You, dear parent, faced a hungover husband unwilling to assist with the baby on a Monday. You snapped, he mumbled a half-hearted apology, and now you're in the icy realm of silence.\n\nAre you the \"asshole\"? Well, it depends on your perspective. The silent treatment isn't the best way to resolve issues, but it's a common reaction when frustration boils over.\n\nYour concerns about unequal parenting and your husband's lack of support are valid. Communication about these matters is essential. It's time for a deep conversation about your roles as parents, especially given your dual roles of working and caring for the baby.\n\nIn the grand scheme, you're not an \"asshole\" for needing a break and voicing your frustrations. Parenthood's a team effort, and this might be the wake-up call your husband needs. It's a chance to discuss how to share the parenting load more fairly because, let's face it, parenting is a wild ride, and both need to steer the ship.", "Overall NTA, the silent treatment isn't great, but it does sound like you are taking care of two children. You need to set your expectations and counseling may not be a bad idea.", "NTA\n\nI was with him till I read he is doing the bare minimum with the baby and seems to be jobless\n\nso he is the AH", "Sometimes \"the silent treatment\" is the only way to get some space/time and not say anything you may regret later and not stop the rest of your life/responsibilities from continuing. But a one line communication (say it or a note/text) of \"I'm still cooling down so I'm not going to be engaging outside of when and where it is necessary until I feel I can communicate constructively\" makes that distinction. NTA if it's a coping tool but it shouldn't be an alternative to communication or a punishment consequence.\n\nI highly recommend a pair of noise blocking headphones. Hungover dad can handle crying better that way (honestly it helps everyone who needs a breather built in...including when needing to tune out a whiny husband).\n\nI don't know if you've seen this, but it's validating af: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/26/gender-wars-household-chores-comic", "NTA He needs to grow up. Take a Tylenol drink water and get to work. Play time is over.", "NTA for processing your anger the way you did - I'd be furious. \n\nThat said, you will need to talk to your partner, and soon. I am not sure why you are allowing your partner to live the free, easy-breezy lifestyle while you do all the work and childcare. I know we women LOVE to fix things and take all the responsibility (because if we take responsibility, we can FIX IT) but this guy is a DAD now, and you are doing the whole family a disservice by allowing Dad to live like a fun single guy instead of being a parent. \n\nWhen is YOUR weekend camping trip with the ladies? Never? Because you know if you left Dad alone with the baby for 3 days it would be a disaster? Right. So Dad needs to step the eff up and you need to stop enabling him, because if anything happens to you, he's all your kid has. And he needs to be able to care for his own child.", "NTA. He went on a camping trip, that's fine, everyone deserves a break and a rest. But you're 3 months out from having a kid, from being pregnant for months. He can't you know get smashed on friday and saturday, take sunday easy and be ready to help with his own child on monday?\n\nThat's some incredibly selfish behaviour, to not only take the trip but be so irresponsible that he can't help his wife after his break, a break OP isn't getting.\n\nSilent treatment is, not great but understandable. Silent treatment is a much more malicious/manipulative tactic when you use silent treatment always to get your own way even when you're being unreasonable. Silent treatment out of frustration when your partner is being wholly unreasonable is not the same. But ultimately it's best to be honest and open, say you're angry as hell and now is not the time to talk, we'll talk about it in a couple of days or whatever.", "NTA, and when do you get your weekend away? I would be booking that asap, even if to stay in a hotel in your town.", "NTA \n\nBut improving things will require talking. \n\nYou may want to consider counseling - a neutral third party can mediate and help both of you agree on a reasonable division of labour.", "NTA, if the silent treatment is your best alternative to flipping your s\\*%t, which is what I might be tempted to do. \n\nIn the long term, though, you'll need other strategies to address this situation.  It's not sustainable.", "NTA \n\nI\u2019m usually annoyed when someone uses the silent treatment, in this case I think OP didn\u2019t speak because they were trying to reign in their temper and not say something they couldn\u2019t take back. \n\nThe silence wasn\u2019t a punishment, it\u2019s was time out.\n\nOp , you\u2019re doing the best you can and your partner is doing the bare minimum ,  it maybe time for a conversation about co parenting moving forward.", "NTA to tell a parent to step up and parent.", "NTA - While a silent treatment is immature and doesn't solve anything, it does give you some time to collect your thoughts to start a discussion.  The way you describe your situation is extremely unbalanced.  You are the primary income earning and primary care taker of your child.  I don't even want to ask how the chores are split because I am guessing you do most of them.\n\nYou are a saint and agreed that your husband could take and ENTIRE weekend off and left you with a 3 MO baby and he still can't step up to the plate.  What a pathetic husband and father.\n\nWhen is your weekend off???  Would your life be any harder without your husband around???  You need to nip this in the butt early or it wont ever get any better.  \n\nI remember when we had 2 small toddlers in the house and I had a friend that was getting married and invited me to his bachelor party.  It was a tall ask to go but my wife agreed.  I came home at 4am and at 6am both toddlers were jumping on me to wake me up.  My wife just looked and me and said your turn and I dragged my sleepy ass out of bed and make breakfast.  Welcome to being a parent.", "In this specific case NTA bc I believe it\u2019s preventing you from really saying something you\u2019d regret and you need calm down.", "Nta", "Everyone is always TA for giving someone the silent treatment, as it's a sign of immaturity. Mature adults discuss issues and resolve them. So, YTA for that and that was your question.\n\nYou are N T A for feeling the way you do and you are right about how your husband should be acting. He had off for the weekend and now he needs to drink some water and coffee, and maybe take a Motrin, and step up to parent while you work. Hopefully, he will do so, and apologize to you, and you can graciously accept his apology.", "YTA grow up youre a parent now", "ESH\n\nHe sounds like he kind of sucks but that's another issue. \n\nIn this situation - if you were ALL FOR IT - surely this wasn't the first time, and being hungover was predictable? \n\nNot saying it's fun or fair - but when you actually get to let loose - I would want some wiggle room knowing that in the reverse situation, I probably also would be tired / hungover and not be at my best, bright and early, immediately thereafter. \n\nYou can be mad about it or you can be an understanding partner. (Unless it's a habit.) \n\nRealistically, your anger is about the sum of the situation. And you need to work on THAT bc it does not sound fair.", "YTA because silent treatment is not the answer. It\u2019s unhealthy.", "immaturity will breed more immaturity. You aren\u2019t an AH but you may end up teaching your child that its okay to ignore people when you don\u2019t agree with them. Forgetting that though, NTA. your husband doesn\u2019t sound very much like a partner, more like a pet or child", "ESH- Being overwhelmed isn't an excuse the same way that being hungover is. You need to communicate. Being an AH as a wake up call to him is poor logic by the NTA crowd. At a minimum, you could have told him that you'll sort it out later. Although, if by silent treatment you disengaging so you don't lash out physically at him, then I get it. It's fine to have standards and expectations but you'll have to adjust and do something about it if he doesn't meet them. In this case, the silent treatment is not the right move.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Thank you for not making me feel crazy.", "I don\u2019t know why everyone condemns the silent treatment.

All I could say, was, \u201cI\u2019m too mad right now, you hurt me terribly, and I don\u2019t have anything to say right now that would be helpful to either of us, so you\u2019re going to have to deal with it for now. we can talk when we have something productive to achieve with conversation.\u201d", "She\u2019s giving the silent treatment, yet he needs to grow up?

If you are the primary earner why isn\u2019t he supporting your work and taking on more childcare/household responsibilities? What is his work schedule?", "I also think there is a difference between the silent treatment that is designed to punish the other person or as a way of communicating that you're mad without telling them you are mad or why and the \"I am literally too angry to speak to you civilly right now\". You told him what you are upset about and he knows. As long as you are speaking to him when it's required to tend to the baby's needs, not wanting to engage with him right is totally fair, especially if you two are both home all day and you don't get the space to be away from him and calm down otherwise.", "This isn't silent treatment. This is beyond overwhelmed and not wanting to scream at someone for not helping.", "As long as it's a way to process your anger, I think it's fine. It may be useful to disengage that way to talk more calmly later. But don't prolong this silence just to punish him, because it's unhealthy for everyone.\n\n\nHe definitely acted like an AH here. Can a father of a child go partying and be hungover the next day? Yes. As long as he accepts that he'd have to take care of his child even when his head feels like exploding. That's called responsibility."]}
