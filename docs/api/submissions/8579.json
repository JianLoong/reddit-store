(We are all in highschool) My best friend recently started dating this guy, who isn't from our school, and from what me and our other friends know about him, he seems super annoying. He is planning to drop out of highschool, has 0 career/life goals, and basically makes tik toks as his 'career' with barely any likes and followers (he plans to drop out on the basis of this). He has 250 followers there, it's not like he's getting anywhere with that (he's doing that for 2 years). \n\nThat's not what's annoying about him. What's annoying is that he looks down upon people who study and want to do something else in life. (College education is extremely cheap in my country, anyone can get educated here//it's free if you opt for that option)\n\nOkay so enough about him. My friend sees nothing wrong with him, she acts like he's perfect, etc etc. Very irritating. Criticizes others for being single. \n\nAfter sending the invite out, my friend asked me if she can bring her boyfriend over for everyone to meet. I said no, i am not comfortable with that and was planning to keep the dinner an only inner circle thing.\n\nShe said please multiple times and then, to shut her up, i said we'll see.\n\nFast forward to the dinner, she shows up with the guy. I looked visibly furious. She said 'she had to get him since it was his birthday today and she had to be there with him for his special day'\n\nI said i couldn't care less, and asked him to leave. My friends weren't comfortable with having a stranger there too, since you can't really be yourself around some random person.\n\nShe got really angry and said that she expected better from me. I said that getting uninvited guests isn't very polite either. The right then escalated and then she said that if he goes she goes to. I just went and opened the door up for them.\n\nShe sent multiple angry texts to me later. 'you mistreated the love of my life' 'you have 0 respect for others' 'you have to be nice to people on their birthday atleast'\n\nI feel bad after that. She isn't talking to me.

You set a boundary, you gave a rationale and you didn\u2019t give affirmative consent at any point. Keep interacting with the world like this and you\u2019ll have a less stressful life.
