If you can pull that off, you can start sneaking in some ASL instruction. \n\nBut if you keep battering your mom with demands and accusations, all you'll achieve is your own mother finding you unpleasant to be around", "NTA\n\nYour mom is right that the rest of the world won't be as accommodating. But there's no reason why her family has to be part of the problem unless they're AHs.", "NTA -\n\nYou are not asking for something too difficult to be able to communicate with a FAMILY member. Yes, no matter if your Mom likes it or not, Sav IS a family member that has some additional needs in communication.  \n\nWhen my husband & I first got together he had grown up with the guy next door who also ended up working with him at his parents business - who was deaf. I went to a family BBQ and met him for the 1st time. It really bothered me that my (now) husband's parents, who supposedly considered this young man ''family'' and he even worked for them - NEVER tried to communicate with him via ASL, or really included him in the conversation.  At the BBQ he was pretty much ignored by my husband's family (except my hubby) and his own parents.  \n\nI ended up teaching myself the alphabet and basic signs to at least try to communicate a little with him.  It really isn't that hard and your mother is making excuses.  Her behavior is hurtful and condescending, entitled and abelist  when she insists on Sav using her hearing aids, even though they bring her pain.   I'm betting that if Sav was a bio child your Mom would be doing everything she can to facilitate communication.   I'd go LC with dear old Mom. She doesn't sound like a kind. loving, considerate, caring or compassionate person.", "NTA. You sound like a wonderful stepmother, and the fact that everyone else in the family has made the effort your mom refuses to make *should* make her ashamed of herself.", "NTA\n\nWhen your mom was an infant did your grandmother call her selfish for not knowing and being able to communicate in perfect English?\n\nDifferent people have different abilities. She's not some 'random person', she's Sav's grandmother who she's know _for nine years!_", "Her assumption that not everyone in Sav's life will be accommodating only shows she's in the same league as a random asshole on the street. If Sav chooses to have someone in her life she should be allowed to only people who respect how she communicates. Sav is a teenager. If anything I think your mom needs to learn not everyone owes her their time and shouldn't be forced to accommodate her unwillingness to learn something new. Sav shouldn't be in pain just cause grandma is a pain. NTA", "> now my aunts are talking about how unfair I\u2019m being to my mother. \n\nAh yes, the person being mean to the deaf child is the one who's the victim.", "\"not everyone in Sav\u2019s life is going to be accommodating,\" No, they won't, but it's not at all extraordinary that her grandparents do. Even step grandparent. Your mother has very clearly been able isthmus and othered your stepdaughter. You are NTA in this situation in any way.", "NTA I would of just started to only talk to her in sign language. If she complains about being left out then use her words against her. That she's selfish to think the world will just accommodate her because she's too lazy/stubborn to learn", "NTA.\n\nWhat you asked your family to do is the literal bare minimum. If this is the hill your mom wants to die on, she can die angry and lonely ig.", "NTA. I don't understand how people have a problem with learning ASL for deaf family members. No one in my family is deaf or hard of hearing, but I learned the basics as a kid and wish it was offered as a language in more schools. I've never had to use the Spanish I learned in high school and college, but I've been able to have a basic conversation in ASL with a deaf student when her interpreter was running late to class. I don't understand why people can't just watch a YouTube tutorial and learn a few of the basics. Your daughter shouldn't have to be uncomfortable just so that grandma can be more comfortable communicating with her. I think grandma is being extremely selfish and you did a good job of standing up for your daughter.", "NAH it\u2019s nice that you learned it, but having the expectation that your mom would learn asl for a sometimes thing is unrealistic. I\u2019m sure it would be great if the whole world learned asl and she could communicate freely, but not a realistic expectation. It\u2019s a lot of work, even more for her as she does not have a practice buddy:", "Or a \"normal person\" - so not only a step-kid denying ahole but a gross ableist too. \nNTA", "I like how you think", "That's sad. I took ASL in college since I had a deaf patient at the care home I worked at so I knew I'd use it at the time; I stopped when I left that employer but now preschools in my area are teaching basic sign to the kids so I got to relearn some signs from my niece recently & have been using those to communicate with her.", "NTA\n\n>Sav if I knew that they wouldn\u2019t be able to talk to each other like \u201cnormal people\u201d.\n\n\"You're right, it was nice knowing you until this, goodbye.\"\n\n>my aunts are talking about how unfair I\u2019m being to my mother.\n\n\"Disgusting, don't call me anymore.\"", "NTA\n\nyour mom is an ableist.\n\nOP, if & when you donget pregnant, expect your mom to be all over that child. She will be calling that baby as her real grandchild.", "NTA.\n\nBut I think part of this is an unknown, how often is your stepdaughter around your mother? If it is daily or several times a week, you'd think she'd put forth an effort. If she sees her one or two of three times a year, then asking someone to learn another language (and that's definitely what it is) jut for her is a bit of a big ask.\n\nMore importantly though, your mother doesn't seem to care about her or value her presence anyway. I'm not sure why you are bothering to force the issue with things like taking her to your mother-daughter breakfast with your mom.  She obviously doesn't view her as her granddaughter, but her daughter's-husband's-kid-from-another-relationship.  I'm not sure you are going to be able to force a connection, nor should you want to anyway.", "NTA. I really don't get your mom and her sisters. yeesh. It is not asking too much to ask her to learn ASL. Truly not everyone in Sav's life will be willing to use ASL, but one would hope her grandmother would be willing to.", "I wanna say N A H but I\u2019m gonna say NTA because of the way she\u2019s acting. In a way, she\u2019s right, she shouldn\u2019t be forced to learn it, but she would if she cared enough to properly communicate with her. You\u2019re not wrong for asking this of your mom, but don\u2019t force it on her if she is unwilling to learn.", "NTA", "NTA at all. \n\nYour mum wouldn\u2019t be such as AH if she was happy with you just translating for her but she became a massive AH for getting in a huff and ignoring her.", "Deafie here. NTA, NTA, NTA. You are totally doing the right thing here. Much love to you.", "NTA. Your mother is TA.  Other than typing out everything she is saying on text there is no other way to communicate with Sav. So your mother accepts translation or learns to sign.  60 is not old. Maybe you need to see your mom less.", "Maybe have a day  where your family does nothing but signing even to each other, and anything that isn't signing is ignored. Not a spoken word at all.  See how she likes it,\n\n My wife and I each knew deaf friends before we met. My friends predominately finger spelled, and her friends predominately signed. But picking up some basic signs is easy and finger spelling fills in the holes. I'd start with finger spelling as I hope mom can spell.   \n\nHell if mom really doesn't want to learn she could use her cell phone and have it translate it to written word for Sav to read.  This would bridge the gap with little effort.\n\nNTA", "ESH. Your mom doesn\u2019t have to learn ASL and Sav doesn\u2019t have to wear her hearing aids.", "NTA. But is there anything doctors can do about hearing aids causing her migraines? She shouldn't have to deal with a choice between hearing aid or debilitating migraine. Is it possible for her to try other types of aids? I'm not well educated in this and wanted to ask.", "It's not all bad, you can have private conversations right in front of her.  And stop translating for her, she made her choice not to try & learn it.", "You are NTA. \n\nYou are, however, a freaking awesome step mum and Sav is incredibly lucky to have you in her life. You are absolutely nailing it lovely lady! \n\nIt is true that Sav will not always have her needs expertly accommodated in all areas of her life. We've fought incredibly hard for disability rights over the decades but we still have a long way to go to achieve equality. People like you make a huge difference by harnessing their love to educate others and make the world a better place. \n\nWhile the world won't always accommodate Sav like it should, the very least she deserves is for her family to do so.", "NTA - but your mom sure sounds like one.", "Honestly, my answer would be to also limit *your* contact with your mom. If you don\u2019t but you stop bringing Sav all you\u2019ll be doing is giving your mom what she wants and reinforcing that how she\u2019s behaving is acceptable, when it\u2019s not."]}
