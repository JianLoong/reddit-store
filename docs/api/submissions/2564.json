Her dad (35m) and I got married when she was 8, and her mom isn\u2019t involved, so she lives with us full time.\n\nSav is deaf. Not completely\u2014 but enough to where she can really only hear loud noises like air planes or the train horn if she\u2019s close enough to the tracks.\nShe does have hearing aids, but she tends to get migraines when she wears them for too long, so she doesn\u2019t wear them often. The only time she keeps them on at home is when my family visits.\n\nI started learning ASL when I began dating my husband, and I asked my family to try to learn at least some after he and I got married. Most of my family did make an effort to learn, all except for my mom (60f). She always said that it was too complicated, or that she shouldn\u2019t have to learn it when Sav could just suck it up for a little and wear her hearing aids.\n\nWe ended up missing my mom\u2019s birthday party, so to make up for it, Sav and I took her out for breakfast.\nSav wasn\u2019t wearing her hearing aids at the restaurant because she only just started feeling better after having a migraine a few days before, so I was translating for her and my mom during the meal.\n\nMy mom started pretty much ignoring Sav. She looked annoyed every time Sav would sign or try to contribute to the conversation, and at one point she asked me point blank why I would bring Sav if I knew that they wouldn\u2019t be able to talk to each other like \u201cnormal people\u201d. I told my mom that if she had tried to learn ASL years ago, then they wouldn\u2019t have any communication issues. My siblings can talk to Sav just fine without mine or my husband\u2019s help and my dad is getting there too.\n\nMy mom said that it wasn\u2019t fair to ask her to use sign when Sav was capable of speaking, and that even if she did want to learn, she didn\u2019t know where to start.\n\nLater in the week I went to a bookstore and got some ASL guide books to give to my mom. When I gave them to her, she blew up at me and told me again that it wasn\u2019t fair that I ask her to learn sign language. She said that not everyone in Sav\u2019s life is going to be accommodating, that my husband and I are teaching Sav to expect too much from others by asking them to sign, and that since Sav can use her voice it\u2019s pointless to have her communicate mainly with her hands anyway.\n\nI told my mom she was selfish for not even trying to learn to speak to my stepdaughter in the way Sav was most comfortable communicating, but expecting Sav to tolerate migraines and \u201csuck it up\u201d just because it was more convenient for her.\n\nAfter I left, my mom ended up telling her sisters what happened, and now my aunts are talking about how unfair I\u2019m being to my mother. And that my insistence on her learning ASL is just unreasonable and that calling her selfish is just plain rude.\n\nAm I really that out of line for saying that to her?", "created_utc": 1668701765, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yxuax7/aita_for_calling_my_mom_selfish_for_refusing_to/", "score": 59, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She only wants to communicate with Sav if it's easy for her (your mom) to do so, and if it's not, she'd rather Sav not even be there - she literally told you that. \n\nI'd honestly consider going as low contact with your mom as possible, and certainly not bringing Sav around her.

She obviously doesn't even like her", "NTA.  Okay, fine, let\u2019s say for the sake of argument that it\u2019s reasonable for your mom to not want to learn ASL.  That still doesn\u2019t justify her acting like it\u2019s *everyone else\u2019s* problem when that shuts her out of the conversation because Sav has no other way to communicate, or saying Sav should just stay home if she can\u2019t \u201cbe normal.\u201d  No, not everyone on Sav\u2019s life is going to be helpful or supportive, but *she* should not be one of the people *deliberately* raising those obstacles.  If she can\u2019t at least work on her ableism, then it\u2019s not going to be productive to try and foster a relationship between her and Sav, and she\u2019s going to have to accept that will mean seeing you a lot less.", "NTA. Honestly, your mom is proving that she doesn't value you or your stepkid.\n\nIf you were really important to her, then she would understand how that kid is important to you and make an effort.

However, that shouldn\u2019t apply to family\u2026 NTA.", "NTA.\n\nYour mother is being unfair to Sav. She has had *years* to learn ASL and has made zero effort. Either she (your mom) is lazy or ableist... or both. \n\nShe is choosing to not even try communicate with her grandchild. Solid AH move.", "I learnt the Australian equivalent of ASL when one of my childhood best friend's sister is hard of hearing and relys on sign language to communicate. As a 27yo I still find having it valuable.\n\nI guess it depends a lot on how actively involved your mother is in savs life. The other option is relying on written communication I guess. I say the fact she's a step daughter is probably the huge reason she does not wish to learn ASL and doesn't really see her as a grand daughter.\n\nBut ASL is no different to learning another language so NAH for not wanting to learn,  though your mother needs an attitude check.", "NTA. You're mother really is selfish and you had every right to call her out on this. She wants someone to be in pain because it's easier for HER. This may be petty, but I suggest taking it a step further and just not having Sav interact with your mother at all since she clearly has ableist tendencies. She also most likely doesn't view Sav as her granddaughter either, which is another reason to not have her be involved in her life any further.", "NTA. A lot of old people treat learning anything new like it's torture, and see not knowing new technology or terms as a badge of honor.

It's awful that your mother refuses to learn. TBH, my petty ass would've had turned my voice off and switched only to signs so she could see how it feels.", "NTA \n\nClearly your mom doesn't care enough about her relationship with you to treat your child, and you are her dad now, with any respect.

Learning is a skill that needs to be practiced and people who reach a point in their life where they feel they know what they need to know, start losing the ability to step out of their comfort zone.\n\nAs we age, everything begins to require just a bit more effort and you mom may be feeling overwhelmed or doesn't want to be inexperienced at this new skill.", "You\u2019re definitely NTA at all. Sav is lucky to have you in her corner. I\u2019m actually deaf/HoH as well and frequently get comments about how well I speak when conversing in the multiple languages I know (very weird accents apparently though lol) and you know why I \u201csound\u201d so comfortable and \u201cnot deaf/HoH\u201d? Because not enough people like you were around when I was a kid and I thought I had to fit myself into as \u201cnormal\u201d a box as I could . The amount of stress I internalized (even though my own parents were great I had convinced myself it would be a burden to tell them how crappy other people were - even got yelled at for trying to communicate via writing with non signing folks )  was honestly unsafe. \n\nSav doesn\u2019t have to go through that because she has you and other people in her life that are showing her that they care about her just being herself as she is most comfortable interacting. Giving your own mom every opportunity to do better, to try and learn, to be a decent person- but also making sure she cannot denigrate Sav or make Sav feel out of sorts - you just modeled how to try and tease some compassion out of someone that has none, didn\u2019t take her bs line about not knowing where to start (love that you responded by providing that starting point so Sav sees you giving her every chance and taking away her excuse at the same time), and then standing up for Sav when needed . Your entire approach was fantastic and will stick with Sav in such a good way !!\n\nHaving someone so unequivocally in your corner means so much to someone navigating through this experience as a child - like just seeing someone model that it\u2019s really not going to stop you from living your life and hold that opinions in such a clear, consistent manner. I literally just stopped communicating for months at one point because I felt like everyone thought I was stupid. That wasn\u2019t true at all but it still felt like it sometimes and I\u2019m so happy that you\u2019re doing everything to proactively ensure Sav never has that experience!!!!\n\nOh and I couldn\u2019t actually even use hearing aids until a few years ago (after having been told that hearing aids would never advance far enough to work for me !) but am a fellow hearing aids trigger migraines sufferer ! Would be happy to chat about that with you and share some tips that might help !", "Ahhh...your mother is resentful. I'm sorry your mother has chosen to cripple your daughter.", "But it's true.
