They were roommates and graduated together, and all that stuff.\n\nMe (30F) and Freddie have been dating for 6 years and we are getting married next January. We\u2019re incredibly happy and we can\u2019t wait to have our fabulous wedding.  We both deal with anxiety because we have very high profile, demanding jobs\u2026 so we agreed to have a small wedding, simple, relaxed and stress-free.\n\nI\u2019ve shared spaces with Callum at my bf\u2019s family events, parties, and he hangs out with my boyfriend a fair amount of time. He's great. I like him.\n\n**Here\u2019s the issue though: Callum does this thing where he sits or stands very still and stares into space for a long , long, LONG time**. Freddie told me it\u2019s a thing called **catatonia**, I call that just zooming out (or dissociating as gen Z said (**Edit:** Three different words. I was wrong)). The problem is that my BF usually babysits him when that happens. I mean, he stays right next to him the whole time. I thought it was like a cute, nice gesture, but on the day of our wedding, I mean, really? That sounds like the opposite of our dream day.  He\u2019s even taller than my boyfriend, so just imagine a 6 '4 guy just standing in the middle of our reception, next to the groom, lmao\n\n**Here\u2019s the conflict:** I talked this privately with Callum, just me and him, and he agreed that he would be a distraction. He declined the invitation. I asked him to not tell anything to my BF and he said he \u201cwould be too embarrassed to say anything\u201d I said \u201cPlease don\u2019t feel embarrassed, I know it's not your fault\u201d and we left it at that very friendly and politely. I told him he it is more than welcome to join us for our christmas dinner, cause I know he\u2019s not close with his family, and like i said, I like him. I told my BF that Callum declined and he was disappointed but he agreed that less guests fitted with our idea of a small lowkey relaxed  wedding, so it was still perfect.\n\nThe next day I told my Mom, my sister and my maid of honour, and they were visibly upset with me. My mom said it was an assholy move and that it was \u201cableist\u201d, but I don\u2019t think that's true because it is not really a disability (**Edit:** it is), I think it is more about his personality and his \u201cthing\u201d that I know is going to take a toll on my boyfriend that day.  I want to make sure I was not a horrible person to pacify my conscience. AITA?\n\n**Edit:** I thought this subreddit was \u201cAITA\u201d not \u201cplease send me d threats and wish the worst for me and my soon to be husband\u201d. Edited to correct what I said about his disability. That was ableist. **Edit 2:**  Too much (well deserved) hate today so I\u2019ll stop with the edits and replies, just gonna say Fred is a loving person and I should be more like him.  I owe Calum a huge apology, and my Fred deserves one too, not just for my lie but also bc I know he LOVES Cal.

If he wants to have Callum there, he knows what Callum is like.\n\nSecond, Callum actually deals with catatonia, and you belittling his clear medial issue just because you don't think it's legitimate IS ABLEIST.

If you don\u2019t want him spending the whole wedding looking after his friend, talk to *him* about making sure that doesn\u2019t happen.  Don\u2019t make the decision *for* him.

This absolutely is a disability and how dare you discredit him when you are not his doctor and not in his body!! \nYou are being insanely ableist. \nAlso you are literally lying to your fianc\u00e9????? Shitty way to start a marriage imo.", "YTA for every reason the comments have already said, but one thing I want to point out is: Zoning out and dissociating are two different things.\n\nZoning out (alternatively called \"spacing out\") is losing concentration and awareness of one's surroundings. Dissociation is a loss of *connection* - eg. feeling disconnected from your body, the world, the time and place. The two look similar on first glance because having a hard time focusing and staying aware of one's surroundings are *potential symptoms* of dissociating, but dissociating is a different thing from and a COMPLETELY different experience compared to zoning out.\n\nAdditionally, zoning out can usually be manually stopped (Keyword: Usually). You realize you're doing it, you refocus, and it's fixed. Dissociation does not work like that. You have to find a way to ground yourself and regain your connection to yourself and/or the world. There are coping mechanism for doing it, but most of the time the only thing that can fix it is waiting it out. It's uncontrollable. \n\nThat being said, you don't get to define if someone else is disabled. It's their life and their identity, so they're the only one who gets a say in it. *However*, I want to ask you: How do you define a disability? Because if something is actively deliberating someome's ability to function (like standing still and staring into nothingness for hours on end) and it's out of their control, I don't know what is.", "YTA:  A simple Google search will show you it id a legit disability", "YTA. Do neither you nor your fianc\u00e9 have a trusted third party friend who could be asked to look after Calum if he goes catatonic? Would that not be something that you could ask a bridesmaid or groomsman to do? Why is excluding your soon-to-be husband\u2019s best friend from the wedding your first idea?", "YTA, I didn't know what Catatonia was but I just did a Google search and it says it is a disability, well a symptom of some disabilities. So you're being ableist there. Even though he declined the invite because of that I feel you should have talked with your fianc\u00e9 because he is close to Callum and he probably wanted him to be at the wedding. So starting off a marriage with a lie isn't a great way to start it off", "YTA\n\n\"Let me be clear: he's NOT DISABLED\" next paragraph: *describes a disability and name AND the way you brush it off*\n\nYou're ableist & insensitive.

You should have discussed this with your fianc\u00e9 and he should have then got to say how he wants to handle the situation", "YTA for not talking openly about this with your boyfriend and figuring out a solution together. Poor Callum. He probably just agreed with you because he didnt want to be the one to ruin the wedding.", "YTA for not fiscussing it between the 3 of you because bf will find out eventually and the longer the lie goes on the worse it will be in the end.

I don't want you to miss out on anything that day. Would you feel comfortable if we asked someone else to sit with him if that happens?\n\nAnd then with Callum:\n\nCallum, we're excited to have you at our wedding. Future husband will obviously be doing a lot of other stuff and I don't want him to miss anything. Is there someone else you'd be comfortable sitting with you if you go catatonic? I want you to have someone too sit with you so future husband doesn't worry. We're happy to add someone to the guest list so you and future husband can have that piece of mind.", "YTA- if you felt the need to manipulate your boyfriend rather than talk to him you are not ready for marrige.

YTA. You know how to recognize it in the future? When you need someone to keep it a secret, you should probably ask who the secret really protects. In this case it's you from what I would imagine was a breakup worthy ethical lapse. I suspect you don't want Freddie to know you care more about appearances and your own comfort than about his feelings or Callum's wellbeing. I also suspect you don't want him to know that you will manipulate your own husband to get your way at the expense of their own happiness. His best friend disinvited from the wedding secretly because his awkwardness (if that's even what it is) makes you uncomfortable.\n\nYou shouldn't be getting married. I'm serious. You need to step back and re-evaluate why you thought this was an appropriate way to manage your discomfort. Your fiance seems like a kind and thoughtful person. He doesn't deserve a relationship with someone who would treat his feelings as entirely irrelevant.", "Yta. So what if they stand for a while? That\u2019s your chance to talk with your friends for a bit. Show off what a great guy he is and show him you\u2019re able to support him when he needs time for other people. Uninviting his friend just sounds selfish.  \n\nAppreciate your fianc\u00e9s ability to empathize with someone because not everyone can.

It is also really cruel to Calum, who might want to be present to celebrate HIS friend as well.

They were roommates and graduated together, and all that stuff.\n\nMe (30F) and Freddie have been dating for 6 years and we are getting married next January. We\u2019re incredibly happy and we can\u2019t wait to have our fabulous wedding.  We both deal with anxiety because we have very high profile, demanding jobs\u2026 so we agreed to have a small wedding, simple, relaxed and stress-free. \n\nI\u2019ve shared spaces with Callum at my bf\u2019s family events, parties, and he hangs out with my boyfriend a fair amount of time. He's great. I like him. I like Callum. BUT he\u2019s a very time consuming person. Let me put this in caps: he\u2019s NOT disabled, let\u2019s make that CLEAR. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Here\u2019s the issue though: Callum does this thing where he sits or stands very still and stares into space for a long , long, LONG time**. Freddie told me it\u2019s a thing called catatonia, I call that just zooming out (or dissociating as gen Z said lol). The problem is that my BF usually babysits him when that happens. I mean, he stays right next to him the whole time. I thought it was like a cute, nice gesture, but on the day of our wedding, I mean, really? That sounds like the opposite of our dream day.  He\u2019s even taller than my boyfriend, so just imagine a 6 '4 guy just standing in the middle of our reception, next to the groom, lmao\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Here\u2019s the conflict:** I talked this privately with Callum, just me and him, and he agreed that he would be a distraction. He declined the invitation. I asked him to not tell anything to my BF and he said he \u201cwould be too embarrassed to say anything\u201d I said \u201cPlease don\u2019t feel embarrassed, I know it's not your fault\u201d and we left it at that very friendly and politely. I told him he it is more than welcome to join us for our christmas dinner, cause I know he\u2019s not close with his family, and like i said, I like him. I told my BF that Callum declined and he was disappointed but he agreed that less guests fitted with our idea of a small lowkey relaxed  wedding, so it was still perfect.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe next day I told my Mom, my sister and my maid of honour, and they were visibly upset with me. My mom said it was an assholy move and that it was \u201cableist\u201d, but I don\u2019t think that's true because it is not really a disability, I think it is more about his personality and his \u201cthing\u201d that I know is going to take a toll on my boyfriend that day.  I want to make sure I was not a horrible person to pacify my conscience. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You\u2019re likely to lie to him again, and one day it\u2019s going to break his trust in you. It\u2019s honestly a little sad Callum didn\u2019t stand up for himself and tell your husband already. He must be used to being excluded. That one comment that said they hear divorce bells already? It\u2019s harsh, and usually I would disagree with telling an almost-newlywed that, but honestly I do too. You can\u2019t lie to your partner and expect it to go well. What if he lied to you about something you found important?\n\nYour family is right, and I suggest you sit down with your future husband and tell him everything. Apologize to him and Callum, and reinstate the invitation. Suggest Callum brings another friend if you\u2019re so concerned about your husband \u201cbabysitting\u201d him (AKA, making sure his friend is okay).

The second one is fixable with learning communication styles but it has to be acknowledged and actively worked through. The first one? Which is what you are, OP, is a lot harder because you're just out for yourself. \n\nAlso it's so strange how cookie cutter people expect their wedding to be.
