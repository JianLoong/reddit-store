I was in an aisle seat and a stranger about my age approached me. He closed the overhead bin above me. The bin had a few bags in it, but it still had room for one more.\n\nHe said to me, \"Tell people that this one is full, okay?\" I just shrugged.\n\nHe went back to his seat, which was a few rows ahead of me and started rummaging around in his carry-on to get out his pillow, book, headphones, etc. His row was the first in the economy cabin, so it was in that weird spot by the emergency door and the bathrooms and didn't have an overhead bin of its own or even a seat in front of it to store a bag.\n\nThe flight continued to board, and the overhead bins closed one by one. Eventually the woman who had the aisle seat across from me showed up and started looking for overhead space. Most bins were closed by then, so she decided to start looking inside some. The guy who closed the bin noticed this behavior and was watching her like a hawk but he couldn't get to his false bin because the line was backed up by this woman.\n\nWhen she started reaching for his false bin, he started yelling, \"No! No! That one is full! It's full!\" But the woman ignored him. So he looked at me and screamed, \"Tell her! Tell her it's full!\" But by that point she had opened the bin and discovered that it was, in reality, not full. He screamed, \"You were supposed to tell her it was full!\"\n\nEveryone in the vicinity was looking at me so I shrugged again and said, \"You can't call dibs.\"\n\nThe man was furious. I ruined his whole flight. He had to find bin space at the back of the cabin and, since he didn't have a seat in front of him, that meant he had to wait for the entire flight to be empty to get his bag. I made accidental eye contact with him a few times while waiting in line for the bathroom and could tell he was not letting anything go.\n\nAfter the flight, I was waiting at the baggage carousel with my boss and telling him the bin story. Well, The guy happened to walk by at that moment and yelled something at me. I told my boss, \"I think he called me 'the dibs guy.'\"\n\nHe turned around and said, \"No!
