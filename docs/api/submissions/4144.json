She's absolutely awesome with my kids but because we didn't get a chance to take her out as a puppy I absolutely don't trust her around other people's kids. I'm not taking the risk. My own kids have been around dogs all their lives and I have always drilled into them to be respectful of a dog's (or owner's) boundaries because dogs can hurt you. Even with our own pets I make sure they know body language and to be gentle. Our older dog growled the other day(first time ever, I assume he's got pain as he ages) because a kid flopped on him accidentally.

I\u2019m personally much more hesitant about children with my dog because they are so much more unpredictable than adults. \nMy dog wasn\u2019t socialized well as a puppy so he has some trust issues. We still go on walks because while he\u2019s distracted on his walk he\u2019s very well behaved, no crazy barking, pulling, etc. I\u2019ve run into certain people I know and let them approach after reading his body language. But I\u2019ve also literally yelled at a child because he wouldn\u2019t listen when I told him no.

The reality is that people will be too busy/preoccupied to interact with them or just plain not interested and that\u2019s OK.

The troop leader approached me and asked if they could very calmly and respectfully get in line and each pet him. I knelt down and asked my dog how he was doing with all this and even though he was really not all about kids, he was okay with it and I told him I\u2019d get him ice cream after. Well, each and every child in that troop got quiet and calm and took their turn, one at a time to pet my dog. It was gorgeous and such a lovely experience. I was so proud of him. All that said, I have snapped at a kid who pulled my dog\u2019s tail and told the parents off as well. It\u2019s so situational.
