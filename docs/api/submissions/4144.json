She asked if she could pet my dog and I said \"No but thank you for asking\" in a very polite tone, then put my headphones back on and kept walking. When I was approaching the rest of the family, the woman of the couple started frantically waving her hand at me/in my path. I removed my headphones again.\n\nShe seemed very irritated and said her daughter was trying to talk to me. I looked back and the girl was standing about where we had crossed looking at us. I said that I had my headphones in. The woman said I shouldn't have them up so high. I just kind of shrugged and said that I had already told her daughter that she couldn't pet my dog and that wasn't up for debate. The woman got even madder and said she wanted to know about my dog because she couldn't pet him. \n\nI just sighed and said we were just trying to finish our walk. The woman asked why I was ignoring her daughter and that I should be able to spare 5 minutes for her. I told her I really couldn't and my dog and I started walking again. Before I put my headphones back on, the woman yelled after me that I was an asshole and I should be ashamed.", "created_utc": 1670383375, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zeqp5d/aita_for_ignoring_a_child/", "score": 446, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Hes prefectly fine but no thank you. No one has ever gotten upset with me over it before.  It blows my mind this lady would. It's ridiculous.

Dogs are NOT public property and people are NOT entitled to pet and interact with random pets they see in public.

To be honest the idea of her standing in the street with a child while screaming at your and calling you an AH is laughable. Classy, classy lady! Lol.

Savage. Just curious on why she couldn't pet the dog? Does your dog not like children?", "Good advice. I have a COVID dog who hasn't been socialized all that well. She's absolutely awesome with my kids but because we didn't get a chance to take her out as a puppy I absolutely don't trust her around other people's kids. I'm not taking the risk. My own kids have been around dogs all their lives and I have always drilled into them to be respectful of a dog's (or owner's) boundaries because dogs can hurt you. Even with our own pets I make sure they know body language and to be gentle. Our older dog growled the other day(first time ever, I assume he's got pain as he ages) because a kid flopped on him accidentally. That kid got a stern lecture for not being careful and an explanation that the growl was the dog clearly saying he didn't like that and it means to back off NOW. \n\nSounds like the kid in the OP at least knew how to act, thankfully.

No is a full sentence.", "NTA and what the hell is up with parents thinking they\u2019re entitled to YOUR dog? I have a nervous large dog who wasn\u2019t socialized well by her first owners and I don\u2019t let just anyone get up in her business, let alone some random kid. Good for you for maintaining boundaries.", "NTA. No one is entitled to pet your dog. I\u2019m personally much more hesitant about children with my dog because they are so much more unpredictable than adults. \nMy dog wasn\u2019t socialized well as a puppy so he has some trust issues. We still go on walks because while he\u2019s distracted on his walk he\u2019s very well behaved, no crazy barking, pulling, etc. I\u2019ve run into certain people I know and let them approach after reading his body language. But I\u2019ve also literally yelled at a child because he wouldn\u2019t listen when I told him no. He kept approaching after I repeatedly told him no and I had to straddle my dog in the street as some cars went by because the child had basically run me off the sidewalk. \nYou don\u2019t owe anyone your or your dogs time or space. Your reasons for it are yours and yours alone and they don\u2019t need to know them.", "NTA. There's reasons why people say \"No\", when asked if they can pet a dog. I had a Boxer that was not good with strangers coming up to her. No one's entitled to pet your dog.
