I had my headphones in. A girl around 7 or 8 was walking towards us and I could see what I assumed was her parents and another child (maybe 3-4) a bit behind her on the trail. \n\nThe girl started pointing at my dog and I took my headphones off. She asked if she could pet my dog and I said \"No but thank you for asking\" in a very polite tone, then put my headphones back on and kept walking. When I was approaching the rest of the family, the woman of the couple started frantically waving her hand at me/in my path. I removed my headphones again.\n\nShe seemed very irritated and said her daughter was trying to talk to me. I looked back and the girl was standing about where we had crossed looking at us. I said that I had my headphones in. The woman said I shouldn't have them up so high. I just kind of shrugged and said that I had already told her daughter that she couldn't pet my dog and that wasn't up for debate. The woman got even madder and said she wanted to know about my dog because she couldn't pet him. \n\nI just sighed and said we were just trying to finish our walk. The woman asked why I was ignoring her daughter and that I should be able to spare 5 minutes for her. I told her I really couldn't and my dog and I started walking again. Before I put my headphones back on, the woman yelled after me that I was an asshole and I should be ashamed.", "created_utc": 1670383375, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zeqp5d/aita_for_ignoring_a_child/", "score": 37, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No part of that is ignoring her.\n\nThis sounds like a classic r/entitledparents story where a parent thinks their child is entitled to pet any animal they see.", "NTA\n\nStrangers are not entitled to your time just because you have a dog. They are idiots because your dog could be child aggressive. At least the kid was smart enough to ask if she could pet it before mauling the dog.", "NTA \nYou were pleasant to the kid and the kid accepted it. The other person made a huge deal out of nothing", "NTA. You were kind in your response and then continued on your way. The mother needs to chill.", "NTA you shouldn\u2019t have to your headphones off for another person much less let them pet your dog. Personally I think the mom was the asshole for making a scene in front of her kids .", "NTA\n\nNobody is entitled to pet a dog. It could be a killer. You never know.", "NTA, \n\nNext time ask if you can pat their child while they pat your dog. \n\nIt\u2019s only fair after all. \n\nHate these entitled parents (although it\u2019s not only parents\u2026.. ) who think the world owes them just because they want it.", "NTA\nNot everyone want to entertain her precious child.\n\nIt would have been 5 minutes too.", "NTA.

It's none of the family's business.", "NTA - that woman is.", "NTA, people like that give parents a bad rep!", "I've had this happen to me as well and have always declined and said it was because my dog was still in training. Hes prefectly fine but no thank you. No one has ever gotten upset with me over it before.  It blows my mind this lady would. It's ridiculous. NTA\n\nAnd I have also been on the receiving end of the no when my kid has asked. He gets sad and wants to know why. I explain it and we move in with our day. Never woukd I ever get upset with a stranger ivee this.", "NTA. It's your dog they have absolutely no right to touch your pet without your permission.", "NTA.  I\u2019ve had this same thing happen a few times and finally yelled \u201cNO MEANS NO\u201d really loudly and sort of freaked them out.  But I really hope the kid remembers me causing a scene and what I said cuz god knows the parents ain\u2019t teaching that kid shit.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
