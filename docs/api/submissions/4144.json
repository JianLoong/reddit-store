Some dogs may be fine with adults but freak out with kids. And not all kids know how to approach and pet a dog and read their body language to respond appropriately. \n\nI have a 6 year old small dog who is chill and sweet. And a 5 month old puppy who is the sweetest happiest thing in the world.. but she's a puppy and is only in the process of learning manners and she can't control herself when someone approaches her. She can easily knock down a toddler in her excitement, or accidentally scratch a face cause she jumps up on them. \n\nPeople should ALWAYS ask first before approaching a dog. And take the No as a complete sentence.", "What's grumpy about not wanting to talk to some random kid and politely moving on?", "I take daily walks without headphones and I can still easily get skulked up on. Bikes can be very silent, people can come out from a corner or tree or whatever.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Like chatting with some kid and/or their entitled parents.", "Some parents feel like others should indulge their kids as they would. While many people do, it is not an expectation because it\u2019s a kid and you should (\u2014- insert anything here).", "It sounded like she was mad you wouldn\u2019t take the time to explain your \u201cno\u201d to her child. You\u2019re still NTA, as that\u2019s her responsibility, not yours.", "You don\u2019t have to justify it. It\u2019s ok to not want to interact with people in public and just want to quietly complete your walk. I\u2019m a parent and I have made sure to teach my child that sometimes people don\u2019t want to interact with her and she needs to accept that boundary and not take it personally. If I were the mom in this scenario I would tell the child, \u201cLooks like this person just wants to walk today and not chat with us. Let\u2019s keep walking.\u201d And it should be a non-issue. The mom is rude for escalating the situation.", "\u201cHey, little girl!  I have some puppies in my van!  Do you want to come pet them?\u201d", "On the one hand, I think politeness is a beautiful thing and being kind as a general rule is great. On the other, children, and often their fairly entitled parents, need to also learn that they are a part of a society and we all do a little better if they are understanding and accepting of the word no. OP was direct and it sounds like polite in the 1st no, but was clear about boundaries. \n\nHumans in general have millions of examples of what happens when people don't respect boundaries, and I'm frankly of the mind that this sub would barely exist if we didn't.", "Hell, I say this to my dog frequently haha! Sometimes it's obvious that someone's dog wants to stop to sniff with mine (and mine is standing there wagging her tail and hoping for hellos) but their owner clearly wants to keep going. So I have to say to her, \"Come on, they don't have time to play today!\" and gently pull her away to continue on our walk. Because holy crap I understand that my dog can take up a lot of time interacting with people and other dogs, and while I'm fine with it, not everyone wants to do that or has the time to do it.", "Dude I dont even have or want kids lol I just like the idea of kids in general living in a world where adults didnt act like it was such a massive fucking chore to spend a teensy bit of extra energy being a little warm and kind to them.", "OP was kind to the kid though..", "But your definition of kind extends beyond politeness. Because op was polite, she just didn't stop her day to go into detail. \n\nDo you stop and talk to everyone who might talk to you? Are you having philosophical debates with the homeless woman you see on the tube and telling your life story to everyone who asks for directions? Because if not, you need to start living by your own standards.", ">Do you stop and talk to everyone who might talk to you? Are you having philosophical debates with the homeless woman you see on the tube and telling your life story to everyone who asks for directions?\n\nBe honest: do you *really* think all of those things are the same as simply being a little bit nicer/sweeter than usual to a kid you happen to come across on your hike? Or are you being deliberately obtuse to feel like you're winning an argument?"]}
