It\u2019s like severe morning sickness that\u2019s pretty debilitating. I\u2019ve lost weight, I struggle to keep anything down, I faint, it\u2019s a nightmare. I cut my hours at 30 a week and even then I really struggle but make myself go in because we need the money. \nMe and my SO both work night shifts, we work opposite shifts and don\u2019t finish until 5am, sometimes 6. On Wednesdays my SO decided to pick up football after work (there\u2019s a work football group) he doesn\u2019t get home until 7:40, I thought I\u2019d take advantage of this by having him run our son to school since I\u2019m poorly but he makes a big fuss over it.\n\nBy son starts school at 8:40, it\u2019s not really having to stay up much longer and helps me IMMENSELY. This brings me to this post, I couldn\u2019t sleep all night and it\u2019s pouring down with rain outside, he came home already wet from football and I asked if he can run our son to school and he basically said yes, then went to bed instead. this is sending the message that he has time for football but can\u2019t spare an extra hour to help me. I\u2019m just sad, not angry anymore just sad, he plays up to his friends (yes I\u2019ve heard him) about how involved he actually is. \n\nWe find out the gender today and I don\u2019t feel like I want him there. Why does he get to enjoy the good parts and not help with the hard parts? I\u2019m not using the baby to punish him but I feel vulnerable, lonely and sad and just want to do it myself. Yes I\u2019ve had these conversations and he just says it will be fine. No resolution, just \u201cit\u2019ll be fine\u201d. I want to keep this pregnancy private and have done a good job doing so since I got sick, his plan was to tell everyone once we find out the gender, I\u2019m not open to that at all, his family cause me a lot of stress because they expect me to dance around them all the time and I\u2019ve got NC with my own for reasons and yes it still hurts. I don\u2019t want to tell anyone. I\u2019m sick and want to be left alone until I\u2019m ready.\n\nEDIT: this is not about the sex, that was to give you information on what scan this is. I don\u2019t care to know the gender. I\u2019m not sure why everyone\u2019s so hung up on the sex, will it make a difference what it is? Will not knowing send us into oblivion? It\u2019s about the actual appointment and how I feel about it. Acting on emotion is never good hence this post to check if I\u2019m an asshole. I don\u2019t want to see the scan, I don\u2019t want to see images of the baby, I don\u2019t want anyone touching or poking me, I don\u2019t want to go, I don\u2019t want to know the sex, I don\u2019t want to reveal to everyone I\u2019m pregnant and I feel very uncomfortable having someone there who has not supported or helped me through it all.

He can step up and rejig his schedule for this period. The options are effectively that he (presumably in good health and not pregnant) moves his sleep schedule by an extra hour to run his child to school, or that his pregnant and unwell partner does so. It's a pretty obvious solution. Is he really feeling so hard done by that he won't willingly do this? \n\nYou've said he's wanting to tell his family the baby's sex straight away. It's totally understandable and reasonable that you don't want that. If you can't trust him to keep this to himself, then I think the better solution is NOT to find out the sex at this scan. For either of you. I think it would be an AH move if you find out without him, and I don't think it would help things in the long run. So maybe just skip finding out at this stage until you're both on the same page about who/when to tell?\n\nWhat you said about him wanting the good bits but not the hard bits of parenting... absolutely this. It's concerning to me that he doesn't seem able to take your word for how debilitating HG can be. Does he think it's just a mild bit of nausea and you can crack on with your day? \n\nYou're NTA but talk to him, tell him what you and your children need from him.", "NTA \n\nI was really questioning whether you were being honest with yourself about whether you were using your child, and having (moreso, not having) your partner here for this scan, as a way of punishing your partner \n\nBut then I got to the part about the in-laws\n\nThat changed my perspective \n\nAs did your partner only wanting to be involved in the good parts, and hyping up his involvement to his friends, but in reality, he isn't doing much to support you, or your needs, imo\n\nIf you need privacy to help get you through the sickness, to a place where you are better able to handle your in-laws, and better able to handle the stress, than I say that is absolutely what is best for you \n\nYou, and your baby's health come first \n\nNot your in-laws wanting to parade you around like the prize winning puppy\n\nNot your partner, wanting to only be involved when it suits his interests \n\nTake the time to yourself, if that's what you need, but if your partner isnt supporting you the way you need, I would advice you to reach out to other people in your support system\n\nPregnancy is hard\n\nDon't try to do it on your own:  even if you don't want to involve your partner just yet\n\nEdited, clarity", "Hey OP I\u2019m not going to give you a judgment, just some virtual well wishes and support. I REALLY think you should head over to r/ebbie45 where you can get resources and support to help you. \n\nHG is no fucking joke, it\u2019s an absolute nightmare but even without the HG/pregnancy I would still be sending you over there. Your partner is\u2026 not a good person, and you are clearly drowning in way too much.", "NTA your SO sounds like a prick. The appointment when you find out the gender is not just to find out the gender, you typically get a full check up to make sure everything else is in line. Having him in the room sounds like it would be uncomfortable and you need to protect your peace where ever you can. Having HG during pregnancy can increase the risk of PMAD (Perinatal Mood and Anxiety Disorders) and PTSD. The HER Foundation has some great information on that. I wish you well and that your SO will pull his head out of his ass.", "NTA\n\nYou have the right to have a private consultation - it\u2019s your body and it\u2019s your right - end of story \n\nOf course as the other parent he has certain rights - but not about this \n\nYou don\u2019t have to have anyone in the delivery room either \n\nBut im so sorry and you need to look at the bigger picture \n\nYou\u2019re having a crisis in your relationship and it needs to be addressed and solved \n\nIf your both working shifts it sounds as though you don\u2019t spend much time together either \n\nPlease tell him - tell him you\u2019re not happy in your relationship at all and things will have to change \n\nYou both need therapy to come to an agreement before the new baby arrives.  Things will get harder when you have two. \n\nYour partner needs to learn that fathers don\u2019t babysit their children - they parent them.", "NTA\nHaving read your comments all I can say is I'm so sorry you are in this position. He has proved that he is not a good partner or father. You are basically a single parent so I'd just start living your life as if he's not in it and I think it will be a bit easier for you.\n\nHim not being at the ultrasound maybe the jolt him into a bit of reality. I know that it did to my husband. I was pregnant with our 3rd child this year and had an ultrasound at 8 weeks which I didn't include him in as he had been an absolute jerk ever since I told him we were pregnant (after actively trying for 8 months). The night after the ultrasound I just handed him the picture and walked off. He changed his tune from then on which was a good thing as our son was stillborn at 21 weeks. He regrets the way he acted the first 8 weeks and knows that he can never take back his actions.", "Omg you need to leave. Don't wait and just go. Reading these comments it's a cry for help. You gotta tell everyone or anyone to get help", "I wanted to say Y T A but the part of you just feeling lonely and not wanting him there because of why he behaves made me change my mind.\n\nI don't think you do this to be petty, you just don't want to see him.\n\nIt is both of your child though, so I would really think about it.\n\nNTA You sound so much overwhelmed and he's a big part of why, so if you can't stand to be around him in a moment like this, I kind of get it. I don't agree completely but I get it.", "OP, I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this. Please speak to your doctor and ask for a recommendation/referral to a counselling service - it seems like you desperately need some support. Then it seems that you need a frank conversation with your husband: tell him that you feel afraid and alone. That you can\u2019t comprehend how unwell you feel. That you need his support and need so much more than he\u2019s been giving. Explain how the thought of having his family and friends swooping in when you feel this vulnerable is making you even more anxious and afraid and that you need to close ranks as a family unit for a few more weeks until you\u2019re feeling more secure. \nAdvocate clearly for yourself in simple terms and go from there. We\u2019re here for you. NTA.", "God, OP you really need to get out.\n\nThe relationship was already failing, the pregnancy was the cherry on top, he let's you do all the housework because \"you made the mess you clean it\", doesn't show support and acts superficially in your pain, half-asses things.\n\nYou're broken. Can you really envision having to deal with a 24/7 needing baby, a son while also expected to do all the chores? Fuck that with a cactus. Plus if you keep this up PPD could become a guarantee more than a risk and guess who's not going to help you.\n\nChrist what a horrible situation. I'm glad at least one redditor is trying to reach out to you because this shit should be inexcusable.\n\nOh and NTA", "Nta. I am so sorry for what you are going through. I experienced similar feelings from having an emotionally abusive parent. I may be wrong but it sounds like you don't want to go to this appointment because you want it all to just go away, to not have to deal with what's happening. Unfortunately, that won't help you, it will just give the haters more ammunition. As hard as it is, go to the appointment for the sake of your health. Is knowing the gender of the child super important to you? If not, I would walk into the appointment room and straight away tell the medical professional \"I don't want to know the gender!\". It's not about spiting your useless selfish partner, it's about the fact that you sound completely overwhelmed already, and piling more information and expectations onto this situation is only going to cause more harm for you, and therefore the child. I think you should speak to the doctor/nurse about how you're feeling too, that you are at wits end and feel you have no support, completely pretend the SO isn't there if it makes it easier. He sounds like a major narcissist.\nOne of the hardest things about feeling like a loner is having to find the strength to stand up for yourself. You might be surprised though, if you reach out to the friends you haven't spoken to in a while. They might miss you just as much as you do them, and people are for more aware of the importance of just being there for others now.", "NTA\n\nMy partner suffered with HG in her first trimester, thankfully relatively minor compared to how it can be and some anti-emetics helped, but for a while she was pretty much bed/sofa bound and had no chance in getting household tasks done, never mind working on top of that\n\nI was a student at the time, in university 5 days a week plus all the at home studying that comes with an engineering degree, and yet I still managed to find the time to pick up the slack from her end, be it tidying up, sorting washing, doing 3am runs to the shop when she fancies something that she could actually keep down, pregnancy is hell for some people and it's literally the least you can do. Yeah I was knackered a lot of the time but at least I wasn't throwing up every 15 minutes\n\nIs stopping him from attending the gender scan with you harsh? I mean yeah, it is, but sometimes being harsh is perfectly justified and if he's not listening to any of your concerns and just dismissing them outright then fuck him, it's your uterus", "While you are at the doctors today, you need to ask about any support resources that may be available. I think some hard conversations with a counselor or therapist are going to be necessary for you moving forward.\n\nI\u2019m not scolding you; however it sounds like your condition is pretty fragile and your nerves are shot so I don\u2019t think bringing this to Reddit and responding back and forth to people who disagree with you is doing you any favors. Find some people in real life to talk to.\n\nYou are entitled to include or exclude whomever you wish in regards to doctors visits and sharing of information about Baby\u2026however there are some things, such as knowing the gender, that traditionally mean a lot to people. Excluding him will have consequences of its own, and you need to be prepared for that.

I really hope you can find the strength to choose yourself. You sound very depressed and my heart hurts for you. I had an abortion with a similar man and he was horrible through the whole thing as I was so sick like you up to the abortion point, no support no help just pure isolation. Please find a local women\u2019s group they\u2019re everywhere and they can give you the in person support you need as well as a way out (if that\u2019s what you want but I think it\u2019s what you need).

Is that what he wants?", "NTA in anyway shape or form \n\nJFC I've had HG with 2 of my 4 kid's pregnancies and if my husband made ANY of the comments yours has made about looking good because I was skinnier, he would have needed to go to the ER to actually remove his head from his ass.\n\nI would puke so much that it was mucous and blood. I had a PICC line inserted 2x because I needed fluids and medications to help me stay pregnant and slightly healthy (at least somewhat hydrated). \n\nYour husband should be helping you, in any way possible. Does your husband say he has to babysit when he's watching your son?", "OP you're going through a lot, and this isn't fair. Your SO should be stepping up good being a dad to support you in this time of need. He should be taking on more housework and parenting etc. But he isn't and that's a huge problem.\n\nYour SO may either be completely oblivious to your needs, or deliberately dismissive of them. The result is the same. You make a reasonable, rational, request of him, he says yes and then fails to come through for you. This is terrible behaviour from an SO. You don't have any control over whether he improve or not. But you do know how well his promises to do better have turned out so far.\n\nUnderstand though that if *he's* invested in knowing the sex of this baby, that excluding him might be the first specific, deliberate step towards the two of your separating. That might not be the worst thing for you, but it's important to understand what this decision might start. I think you're NTA given the state you're in, but he would have cause to complain.\n\nRaising a baby alone (or effectively alone given your SO) when you've already got a school aged kid is really hard work. I recommend taking every opportunity you have to find and forge a support network that has nothing to do with your SO and his family. Find out if your obgyn or local council arrange mothers' groups, and see if you can join an existing one. Look to see what other local meetups exist in your area for parents of little ones. Talk to the parents of your son's friends. Friendships form as a result of repeated positive interactions with people.\n\nUse any maternity leave you have to make a few new friends. Even if you stay with your SO it sounds like you will still be better off with a much healthier support network.", "NTA", "NTA. You deserve better. If you can take nausea medication, and keep it down, and it actually work (it didn't with my last pregnancy) you should. \n\nAnd the likelihood of him changing is very low.

It's also slightly immature.\n\nAs a child who had to deal with parents who use their kids, your comments triggered some very painful memories for me. The words sound similar, the reasons are similar. Thankfully now I have a loving husband, but if I didn't, and I have had scares with some terrible exs, and in those moments I knew my job would be to do my best to keep a good and healthy relationship between baby and dad, regardless of what's going on with me and dad. The better people in my life saw how useless my own dad was, and I remember very respectfully, how much they would do nothing but encourage an active and positive relationship as much as was feasible and be healthy. Even my mum, who usually let her emotions run everywhere, the one thing she did, was always encourage me to engage with my dad. And that woman, she was on her own in everything, raising us, paying for us, giving birth to us. I respected those people. I did not respect the people who said, I shouldn't see x parent, or they don't do enough for me, or they are not the one dealing with you so why do they get to be involved, or they would rather do X than look after their own kid!. I NEVER appreciated that, so take that warning from a kid who had people speak the things you are speaking and grew up. My view is baby's needs come first where safe and healthy. And baby needs their dad, not to have him pushed away further.\n\nNow your husband currently seems very neglectful, like he isn't really acknowledging the support you need from him. And quite frankly if he keeps being like this he may loose his family. However Your communication seems broken, like you can't talk about this or anything... As much as you want to keep the pregnancy sex a secret it's a mutual decision, this is both, of your baby. But it comes across as you just don't see each others perspective on anything.. I think some major communication support is needed. You are especially vulnerable, and you need the support from him. I think there needs to be a way to address these communication issues between the both of you rather than resort to isolating and dismissing one another.\n\nYour thinking here, about not including him, as much it hurts me to hear.", "Esh\nweaponizing the kid before they are even born. Disgusting", "Nta and Yta mostly nta, he needs to pull his finger out his arse and help, but you are in fact using the baby to punish him.", "Yta.

It\u2019s like severe morning sickness that\u2019s pretty debilitating. I\u2019ve lost weight, I struggle to keep anything down, I faint, it\u2019s a nightmare. I cut my hours at 30 a week and even then I really struggle but make myself go in because we need the money. \nMe and my SO both work night shifts, we work opposite shifts and don\u2019t finish until 5am, sometimes 6. On Wednesdays my SO decided to pick up football after work (there\u2019s a work football group) he doesn\u2019t get home until 7:40, I thought I\u2019d take advantage of this by having him run our son to school since I\u2019m poorly but he makes a big fuss over it.\n\nBy son starts school at 8:40, it\u2019s not really having to stay up much longer and helps me IMMENSELY. This brings me to this post, I couldn\u2019t sleep all night and it\u2019s pouring down with rain outside, he came home already wet from football and I asked if he can run our son to school and he basically said yes, then went to bed instead. this is sending the message that he has time for football but can\u2019t spare an extra hour to help me. I\u2019m just sad, not angry anymore just sad, he plays up to his friends (yes I\u2019ve heard him) about how involved he actually is. \n\nWe find out the gender today and I don\u2019t feel like I want him there. Why does he get to enjoy the good parts and not help with the hard parts? I\u2019m not using the baby to punish him but I feel vulnerable, lonely and sad and just want to do it myself. Yes I\u2019ve had these conversations and he just says it will be fine. No resolution, just \u201cit\u2019ll be fine\u201d. I want to keep this pregnancy private and have done a good job doing so since I got sick, his plan was to tell everyone once we find out the gender, I\u2019m not open to that at all, his family cause me a lot of stress because they expect me to dance around them all the time and I\u2019ve got NC with my own for reasons and yes it still hurts. I don\u2019t want to tell anyone. I\u2019m sick and want to be left alone until I\u2019m ready.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA - I can see from the comments that you\u2019re really upset and struggling, I\u2019m so sorry. I think it\u2019s worth sitting down and thinking how you want to move forward when you start to feel better. The health of you and your children come first and it doesn\u2019t sound like your partner is treating you well or is really that nice to you at all at the moment regarding responsibilities. If he\u2019s not willing to change, go to therapy, or take your requests seriously then it might be time to consider pulling away from the relationship for your own benefit", "Get some counselling please.", "You don't have to find out if it's a boy or girl, tell them at the scam you want a surprise. They will hide it from you if possible if you ask.", "So sorry to hear you are going through this. You absolutely need to look after yourself first and foremost. If you want to keep things private then you should do that for sure. \nI think you should either skip the gender scan altogether. Or go by yourself and not tell him you know the gender etc. I don't think it's an AH move. It's your body. Your medical tests and medical information. \nI don't think it would serve you to let him know that you know the gender and are not telling him. I can easily see that as turning nasty and increasing the heat. \nNTA", "Nta for not wanting him there regardless of what scan it is\n\nEta: if you don't care to find out the gender then just tell them so, if your SO has issue with that just ask him \"does it matter what genitalia it has other than them being healthy?\". If you don't find out the gender and he says something about it being unfair, then just point out that you also don't know and plan to keep it a surprise for the birth or something.", "NTA, tell your partner you won't be finding out today because you don't feel up to the extra scan time while they try to find the right bits, so you are just going to nip in, put up with as minimal messing around as possible and then nip out and you don't want him there because you think he will try and turn it into a \"now we are here let's find out the gender\" and you are already annoyed with him over the school run. If he refuses, phone the sonographer and ask them to move the appointment because you want to come alone due to low mood and feeling so rough and your SO isn't happy about it so you would rather do it at another time. Your SO is likely going to tell his family whether you find out the gender or not though. If you don't let him find out he will do it because there is no point in him waiting anymore and he will be pouty about it, and if you do, well then he will just stick with his original plan. Block their numbers if you feel like they are going to add to your troubles at the moment so you can just focus on what is important.\nYou do sound a little blue though, love. Might be worth speaking to your doctor about your feelings because it isn't uncommon in pregnancy, especially when health takes a battering, and they will support you not only with your mental health during the pregnancy but also by looking out for you after birth because you will be more vulnerable to post partum depression if you experienced low moods during the pregnancy. Take care of yourself, you will feel better but it does suck right now xxxx", "NTA. But I think you could go about it a better way.\n\nExplain to him that you feel vulnerable, lonely and sad, and do not let him respond with only \"it'll be fine.\"\n\nIf he chooses to not acknowledge you and what you're going through, then consider what you said about his family. They cause you stress because they want people to dance around them all the time. This is the family that helped shape your partner. Is it really a surprise he ended up being as selfish as he is?\n\nIf he still responds poorly, you still need to maintain your boundaries. \nBut I wouldn't learn the gender and use it as leverage, I would simply not learn the gender.\nYou don't want to give him ammunition to use against you", "I had HG with both of my girls , lost 2 stone first time , 3 second time .

You need a support system because it's only going to get worse from here if you stay. Sure you could attempt to communicate with him about it and have a real talk but it seems you've already done that and his behaviour has stayed the same. You won't be able to leave immediately because yeah, now isn't the best time.

I wish you the best, stay safe.", "NTA. It seems like you don't want him there/don't feel comfortable having him there for the appointment, not because it's the appointment where you find out the sex of the baby but because you've been generally uncomfortable with him lately because of how he's been acting. If you were trying to withhold the sex of the baby from him after you two have established it's something important to you both, you would be punishing him and it would be an everyone-sucks-here in my opinion. But your edit makes it clear it's not about this specific ultrasound, it's about having him involved in a vulnerable procedure at all when he has been neglecting you and his responsibilities otherwise. So in my opinion you're not the asshole.\n\nIn either case, he is definitely a huge asshole.", "NTA \n\nHe can't be bothered to parent your son, why should he get the fun parts?", "Oh no, if it were me I would be waking his a** up to take the kid. No sleeping until he does his part!

You say you are not, but it does seem as if you are using this appointment to punish your partner. From what little backstory you have given, it seems like your family situation may be complicated on both sides, and I assume that maybe neither of you had any good model for how a relationship(or a family) is supposed to work. Take your partner to the appointment with you or not, that is up to you, but both of you need to sit down and really discuss how important family and sticking together is for you, and that with a child on the way your individual wishes and ideas may have to come second for a while (like his games).", "NTA I'm so very sorry for the immense pain you are so obviously in.  I can imagine how alone and distraught you feel, and this internet stranger would like nothing more than to give you a big hug and a shoulder to cry on.  Call your doctor and tell them you want to be alone for this medical appointment, the nurses there can be the bad guys and keep him out.\n\nYou are in crisis and this is way more than just a single doctors appointment.  Your husband is failing you, your marriage, and your family and you deserve better. I would recommend 4 things all relating to getting the support you need.  Please note that these suggestions are made assuming you are not hiding he has been physically abusive to you or your son.  If he also abuses you physically then many of them would be shifted to ensure your safety until you can escape.\n\nFirst, you need to stop trying to be superwoman.  Scale back from what you feel you should do and do only what you absolutely have to do.  Don't clean his stuff, don't make his dinner, don't care if he is upset.  Focus solely on what you need to survive this period of time, which should in lude sharing your depression with a doctor and following their advice whether you want to take pills or not. Don't let him shame you for doing this, he is a full fledged equal in your home.  Any criticism should be met with, your right I suggest you clean it up, fold it, wash it, etc.\n\nThen you need to see a lawyer, and find out what your rights/entitlements are should you leave your relationship.  What would support look like?  What would your housing situation be?  Get enough information for you to make an informed decision as to whether you should stay with him.  From the outside looking in, it appears you would be better off without him.  He would have to step up on his time and take care of himself and your son and you would get some much needed time to yourself. \n\nYou need support.  I know you said you drifted apart from your friends, but is there anyone you used to be close with that you could reach out to?  Many people rekindle friendships from their youth as they grow older.  If they loved you and you loved them then maybe they would love to hear from you as much as you need that connection.  If not reach out to some internet support groups, for mothers, for people dealing with HG, any group that has like minded people in it is a chance for making a new connection.  You can also DM me, I've got 2 good ears and would love to talk to you if you are open to it. \n\nLastly, if your husband used to be a good man, husband, and father you can try one more time to snap him out of the selfish, shitty, neglectful place he is in.  Find a therpist and give him a choice you give up too or he begins trying on all fronts.  He pulls his weight immediately, putting down the phone, being an active husband and father, and helping you while you are in crisis.  And then you follow through, stop giving him and your relationship any more effort than he does for you. \n\nI personally would scream from the rafters at how shitty he is being.  He would not get away with taking credit for my work, his friends would hear \"bullshit, I put him to bed already myself\" his mom would hear \"like hell you did, what kid were you at the park with? I was alone with our son as usual while you [played, socialized, sat on his phone]\".  It is not your job to stand by and listen to him tell a story of a make-believe reality where he is a good father and husband.
