She will struggle in life because of this. So suggest that you tell her that kind of name calling is not acceptable.", "YTA. It\u2019s okay to laugh at the sarcasm, it is kinda funny.

And YTA for not explaining this to your asshole kid. Even when (especially if?) your sister is a moron.", "Going against the grain with NTA. Your sister said something mind-numbingly stupid. \"Have you tried putting him to bed?\" What the actual fuck. That sounds more sarcastic than anything your daughter said. She said something dumb and got called out for it, and maybe right now that's what the world needs tbh.

Every teenager does that (plus kinda deserved to your sister's answer). Blatant insulting? Do better. So my answer is YTA.", "I don't think the moron part needed to be said but I don't see what is wrong with the sarcasm.

The sarcasm was 100% called for but now is the time to teach the lesson of calling people out for idiotic comments without calling them idiots. Even if they are idiots.

Come on now.", "I am very torn on this one.. part of my thinks 'she had it coming' making such a dumb and useless remark, but the 'moron' is uncalled for and rude. You should address the latter as a parent.", "NTA, being able to be sarcastic is a sign of intelligence. Learning when to be and not to be sarcastic will come with time.

I would've gotten an ass whooping from my mom if I were disrespectful to any family member, let alone calling them names. Sarcasm is fine ( to a POINT) but the name calling was completely uncalled for.", "So N T A over the initial laugh about the sarcasm. YTA for laughing at her being called a moron.

Punishing the kid certainly is not the right thing to do.", "Soft YTA, but also ESH. \n\nPeople offering obvious, stupid, and simplistic advice when you express a challenge to them is incredibly annoying. I have sleeping problems, and I all too often hear have you tried going to bed at the same time every night? Have you tried giving up coffee?\n\nThanks geniuses, I never would have thought of that on my own. \n\nSo your sister was being very annoying by offering stupid advice. The direct implication is that she thinks you are stupid, and your daughter's response was not on warranted. \n\nCalling her aunt a moron was a step too far though. Your daughter shouldn't talk to people that way, and it's true that you should discourage that sort of disrespectful behavior. Not just to another adult, but to anybody. \n\nSo soft YTA.

I have no qualms calling idiots idiots.", "I guess me and 99% of the other commenters here come from VERY different backgrounds, because I would\u2019ve been laughing my ass off at that moronic suggestion.

Seems like your sister's initial statement to \"put him in bed\" was sarcastic so your daughter responding with sarcasm was justified, however calling her aunt a moron was uncalled for, so you should have corrected her there.", "YTA. Don\u2019t be surprised when your daughter (and she will) calls you the same things but worse.", "YTA. I get that you\u2019re tired and the suggestion was annoying. And sarcasm is okay in a lighthearted joking manner, but calling someone a moron is a bridge too far.", "YTA \n\nMaybe you don't have a good relationship with your sister, and you're all sleep deprived, BUT you're teaching your daughter that it's funny to be rude. It will eventually backfire on her. \n\nMaybe your sister was being an AH too but you don't say you thought her comment was moronic. You and your daughter need to apologize to her.", "YTA\n\nYour daughter is rude and has a terrible attitude", "I'm starting to hate the phrase, \"it's a kid thing\" or \"it's a teenage thing,\" because it's dismissing the problem caused by your kids.

Be better.", "This was a silly question to ask but it was totally unnecessary for your daughter to disrespect her at her own house. Teenagers are moody but it doesn't mean it's appropriate. By laughing you actually encouraged bad behaviour. Both of you should apologise to your sister.", "Shouldn\u2019t of laughed, I can see her point. But you\u2019re NTA. Honestly it\u2019s hard to judge a 14 year old for being sarcastic. Does this give her an excuse to be rude? No. Will it change overnight? No. Your best bet is to talk to her without talking down to her. Set an example for communication, and every time she goes out of bounds firmly correct her. Make routine of this. Should change. \n\nNAH.", "NTA. It was a good comeback. She was polite when she replied sarcastically. The asking to be polite was moronic", "NTA - stupid comment. Daughter is also sleep deprived, so those not sleeping deserve grace.", "The moron part was the step over the line imo", "The sarcasm is totally fine. I was raised in a very sarcastic household and my mom never stopped me (obv with limits being made clearly understood). But I think it's not great to encourage your daughter to call someone moron.", "YTA. The sarcasm was funny. You should not be encouraging name calling. One is a joke. One is mean. There's no punchline. \n\nYes, your sister's advice was tone deaf. Your daughter was being mean.", "YTA - your child called your (presumably) adult sister a \"moron\". You laughed.", "YTA. Sure it was funny, but the name calling was uncalled for. Are you gonna be giggling when you get called in to the school because your daughter had clever lines when she bullied people?

Please be like my mom and correct your daughter\u2019s behavior before she becomes a bully", "The daughter totally wrote this. YTA for calling your aunt a moron.", "YTA.  Daughters first reply?  Sarky, but acceptable.  Her response of \"moron\" is just rude, and your laughter just validates to her that acting like a mean girl and being rude to others is funny.  You arent doing her any favours by letting it go unchecked, and I doubt youll find it quite so amusing when she turns it on you when you next annoy her, and she will because you have tacitly shown her its ok to treat people this way.", "N T A for the sarcastic response and you laughing. Y T A for not reprimanding her for calling her aunt a moron", "YTA", "YTA. You know you're supposed to establish boundaries for respectful behaviour", "YTA: The first comment was funny but then insulting her was too far.

This wasn\u2019t just sarcasm.  If it had stopped after the first comment it would have been that.  Then your daughter outright called her aunt a moron.

Sarcasm is one thing but calling your sister a moron was completely uncalled for and you should have done something about that.", "YTA. I think I would be harsher than most redditors for both the sarcasm and the insult. Both really were unnecessary. The first is borderline ok ... in the right context. The second is inappropriate. OP I grew up in a household where sarcasm was the order of the day. It took me way too long go realise that my parents 'brutal honesty' and sarcasm was simply nothing more than meanness by which time I caused a lot of harm to my personal and professional lives. I can be sarcastic and mean but only when I'm bantering with close friends. You need to get your daughter to cut that shit out immediately.", "YTA and so is your daughter. \n\nFirst, no her sarcasm wasn\u2019t even funny it was quite lame. \n\nSecond, the conversation didn\u2019t concern her. Nobody was talking to her. \n\nThird, calling her a moron was completely out of line. \n\nFourth, the advice wasn\u2019t rude nor is it necessarily as stupid as it sounds. Some parents try to rock their kid to sleep or walk around holding them or linger over them etc.", "If any family member called me a \u201cmoron\u201d in my own home I would ask them to leave immediately and ban them from my home for entire year.  I\u2019d even throw nice parties that they\u2019re not welcome to attend just to drive the point home. \n\nYou\u2019ve gotta nip this in the bud fast because quickly it\u2019s going to feel very good to put other people down especially when one\u2019s self-esteem is suffering, which has been known to happen to the average teen on occasion.", "YTA. You\u2019re encouraging her to be mean.", "NTA It is a teenager reaction to a stupid question. Your laughing would be a great relief from the stress you have from lack of sleep. Your daughter was right to call her a moron. I hope you can get your son into a good sleep pattern soon.", "NTA, but sort of E S H. I don\u2019t care. That\u2019s actually stupid advice. She is a moron. Daughter probably shouldn\u2019t call her that, even though that advice was actually stupid.", "NTA, the first comment was fun, the second went too far. However it's a good moment to teach your daughter exactly this, that she can be fun and sarcastic, but insulting is not a joke anymore, so she needs to stop there.", "[deleted]", "NTA - I mean, calling her a moron isn\u2019t ok but outside of that it was a pretty dumb question and your daughter simply spoke for literally everyone else.", "YTA.

I understand the sarcastic comment, teenagers do that but calling her a moron would not be something I would allow my child to do. I think your sister handled it well and agree that by laughing you are encouraging the behavior.", "You and the kid sound annoying", "YTA - making a sarcastic joke is one thing, calling a person, especially an older person, a moron, is a whole other level.\n\nWhile your laughing was probably spontaneous, I would have reminded your daughter to be sensitive and polite to her aunt. I would hope she has enough empathy to apologize without having to be forced to do so.", "If your daughter tried that in any Asian household, she\u2019d be 6ft under.

She has 2 daughters. I don't have any kids. One day we met for lunch and her younger daughter spent the entire time ridiculing everything I said. I looked at my sister and she was just smiling, looking amused at my hurt face and tears. My other niece apologized for their behavior, later when we were alone, although she was not the one who needed to apologize. \n\nThat was over 20 years ago and when our beloved aunt died shortly after that lunch, I cut off contact with almost all of them. Don't be surprised if she does the same with  ypu at some  point. YTA.", "Wow. The fact that you even had to ask this. Of course YTA.", "Yes, YTA. You weren't until you laughed at the insult, also. The joke? Sure. Calling someone a moron? Nope. That's where it crosses the line into bullying.", "YTA. Well that comment from your daughter (calling her a moron) was just mean and uncalled for. You should not have laughed and told your daughter that sort of thing isn't OK.", "YTA. you are teaching your kid to be a brat", "Well, in defense of the daughter her aunt was a moron.", "YTA - I was with you with the involuntary laughter but not calling your kid out on sating your sister was a moron is way out of line. She absolutely deserved an apology and learn to parent your kid. So rude, the both of you!", "YTA for sure.
