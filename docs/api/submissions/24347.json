My wedding date has been a point of issue for the last four months, ever since we booked things. My oldest sister June (38f) is married to John (40m) and they have two kids together (2f and 4m). John also has three from his first marriage (11m, 10f and 9f). They will be with their mom the day of my wedding per John and his ex's court ordered parenting plan. June and John expected me to change the date of our wedding to a day where the kids could be there. But they are not the only ones who won't be attending. My oldest brother's oldest daughter (14f) will be with HER mom that day too. But June and John think this is an act of me showing John's kids they are not really family and that's not what this is at all. This is a date that works for the majority of people. It's a date that works for my fiance and I the best also. June has approached several members of the family complaining and trying to win them to her side. It has caused conflict with our oldest brother because he pointed out that he can't have all his kids there either. But he's not going around trying to add peer pressure to change the date just to have his kid there and to hell with everyone else. June said this was different and told him he should be supporting her.\n\nThe issue has become SO dramatic now. June is saying I'm selfish and that my fiance should be trying to make a better entrance into the family. She told me I should be prioritizing family attending more than anyone else. I told her we are, to the best of our ability, but we can't magically find the perfect date to have every single person there. I told her she could always try getting John to work something out with his ex. She said I know that his ex would never agree.\n\nI feel like this has become a bigger issue than it needed to be but maybe I'm being an AH here. June has called me that once or twice and John has yelled it at me five times already when he tried to convince me to change the date. He even offered to pay us to change it.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1691688186, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15nijyo/aita_for_not_setting_my_wedding_date_around_when/", "score": 118, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And lastly, this is no longer up for discussion and anyone who wants to pick this hill to die on can also CHOOSE not to attend\"\n\nNTA", "You are NTA.\n\nHas anybody asked the mother's if they are willing to swap or flex custody for this unique event?", "NTA. \n\n1. IT'S. YOUR. WEDDING. Calling you selfish over your wedding is like calling a baby selfish over its diaper to me.\n2. You made the best booking call you could. If she's taking that too hard, it sounds like she's not dealing with the blended family dynamic as well & is over compensating. Your brother's daughter isn't coming either lol.\n3. Also, that \"my fiance should be trying to make a better entrance into the family\" kinda rubs me the wrong way. Feels like there's an underlying issue there if you all have made it all the way to readying to walk down that aisle & she still feels like he hasn't \"endeared\" himself enough", "NTA. They should take this up with the other parent, not with you.", "NTA. The wedding is about you and your partner.

And what the hell is it with divorced parents not being able to act like adults with some common sense. They can just switch weekends. Then again I guess that\u2019s why they they\u2019re divorced in the first place.", "NTA It's unreasonable to expect a bride and groom to schedule their wedding around guests court mandated custodial agreement for minor children. I think your sister has some main character tendencies. She's trying to stir up drama because two adults don't get along well enough to switch a weekend for custody their shared children is ridiculous. It's your wedding, your sister's husband custody agreement is the least of your worries.", "NTA. Planning a wedding with a large family basically guarantees that you won\u2019t be able to find one date that works for everyone. \n\nThe real AH\u2019s are your BIL and his ex who, with over two months notice, can\u2019t workout switching around the custody schedule to accommodate an important family event.", "NTA.\n\nWithout knowing your circumstances, it could be hell to reschedule. What if the venue won't be available again for a while? What if you and your fiance already put in to take off from work and other arrangements have been made? Would changing the wedding date screw up honeymoon plans and reservations?\n\nYour sister needs to grow up and stop trying to be the main character in your wedding", "NTA\n\nNo wedding day is going to work for absolutely every guest.  You have to decide who are the most important to you, and it's fairly common for children of guests not to be the most important guests to the bride and groom.  Unless these are niblings you are particularly close to, it wouldn't make sense for you to schedule your wedding around them.  \n\nCrazy that they think their custodial schedule is your scheduling issue to resolve.  That's their business, and if they can't ask for an exchange of dates due to an acrimonious relationship with the other parent, oh well.  That's not your issue to resolve for them.", "NTA leave it. Don\u2019t feed the drama. Don\u2019t even start defending yourself especially on FB or texts! Mostly because you don\u2019t need to but also it will just stir the pot and get others involved in the drama. I can\u2019t imagine why, for a big event like a wedding,  John can\u2019t try to put some effort into changing the visiting day. Unless the ex is totally unreasonable this shouldn\u2019t even be a problem. I can almost bet he will when he realizes you aren\u2019t changing the date. They\u2019re really lucky you are having kids there at all! That could be your next move. No kids at all.", "This is just silly. You and your fiance set the date that's convenient for you, not for your niblings.

If I were in your shoes, she would\u2019ve been uninvited the first time she overreacted on this.", "NTA.\n\nDivorced blended mom here...in this situation, with signficant advance notice, if the kids are invited the parent can reach out to the children's other parent and ask to switch weekends.  If the can't, so be it.  Part of the reality of being in a blended family.", "NTA. The only people we asked whether our date worked when planning our wedding was our parents.

The kids probably don\u2019t even care anyway!", "NTA \n\nSo the bride and groom are to be inconvenienced by not having the stepkids there?

John's (11m, 10f and 9f) don't want to go to a wedding.  This is about June not getting her way.  Not getting to show off her perfect family and get their pictures in their perfect clothes.

Classic narcissist BS.\n\nNTA  Enjoy your wedding!", "NTA - This issue doesn\u2019t have to be dramatic. You gave her your answer. You are not changing your date.

It is not going to be changed, the wedding is about family, not about taking sides to pressure you into changing it.", "NTA\n\nPotentially reading between the lines here, but sounds to me like there was an unrelated incident in which June/John felt their kids were slighted and they didn\u2019t say anything then, so they\u2019re doubling down this time.\n\nWeddings have so many different vendors and people to coordinate around enough as it is and this is your day. You are not the one who should feel like you have to compromise for every little thing. It is an issue of June and John\u2019s unwillingness to participate in basic communication with the kids\u2019 mom that is the root of the problem imo.", "NTA who the f\\*ck are they to tell you too change the date.

That was not enough, apparently... \n\nThe second we announced it so many family members weighed in about work conferences, previous plans (and this was six months or more in advance). They had the date whittled down to TWO weekends of the entire summer! Ugh! We picked a day (one SIL told us it wasn't the BEST for her family but they came anyway.) \n\nMy advice is just pick a date and let the chips fall where they may.
