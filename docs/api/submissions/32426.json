{"id": 32426, "submission_id": "18bku0a", "title": "AITA for taking Xmas off when I don't celebrate?", "selftext": "Long backstory but needs some context.So I (31M) have been working for this company for just over 5 years and this will be my 6th Xmas working here. I work in IT and we used to have a couple of us working from my team over Xmas to handle emergencies and make sure everything runs smoothly.\n\nI have always worked over Xmas because I am Muslim and don\u2019t celebrate it and honestly didn\u2019t mind because it is generally quiet and I can get loads of stuff done that we are usually too busy for. Our team as well as the company got downsized in the middle of 2022, bringing my team from 9 to 4 (1 Manager, 3 Techs), so I worked 2022 Xmas by myself. Well to put it kindly it was a shit show.\n\nTo cut a long story short- There was a network outage overnight due to faulty piece of equipment that needed replacing.- Got quotes from vendors to provide replacement equipment and same day delivery and installation.- All quotes need to be approved by Directors of department, reached out multiple times to mine (who was OOO) and got no response- Reached out other directors who were \u2018WFH\u2019 and they didn\u2019t want the cost associated with their department and all of that other office politics bullshit.- Eventually get authorisation but it\u2019s after 3pm, too late for same day fix, issue gets resolved the next morning.- People were pissed by the length of downtime.\n\nI simply said to myself never again and immediately put in holiday for Xmas 2023, not wanting to deal with that again. Manager approved, happy days.\n\nSo here is where the issue lies, over the course of 2023, my manager left and one of my colleagues was promoted (fairly so) and hired one of his buddies to take his old job, he was qualified so I had no issues.\n\nAll was good until a few weeks ago when my new manager realises I have taken Xmas off and this means the new guy (been here 4 months) would be covering Xmas. We had a conversation and he mentioned me taking Xmas off, I jokingly said something along the lines of \u2018After last year, I ain\u2019t doing that again.\u2019 and we shared a laugh and I thought that was the end of that. Instead, I have been getting asked by both my manager and the new guy if I could take my PTO earlier in the month and cover Xmas multiple times. I simply kept rebuffing them.\n\nThe vibe in the team has shifted and I have been getting short, curt answers or no answers at all when asking questions as if they are trying to freeze me out.It\u2019s petty and childish, but I can do passive aggressive and petty as well, so when someone came to my desk yesterday for help, we got to chatting and I asked about their holiday plans, and then they asked about mine. I raised my voice so they could hear and said \u2018Not a damn thing, me and the wife will probably be sat watching TV most of the time\u2019 the looks I got of disdain were great and I loved it.I went to dinner last night with some friends and told them my tale, some found it hilarious, some were less amused.\n\nSo reddit am I the asshole who stole Xmas?  \n\n\n\\*EDIT: Sorry, I wasn't clear, the person working gets Xmas Day and Boxing Day (26th) off as they are public holidays. They will be working the Wed-Fri of between Xmas and NY.

It's the same argument people make when you are single. Well, you don't have a family as tho people were dropped out of the sky by a stork. You don't have to be married to have a family. The majority of the people who take Christmas Day off don't spend it in church praying. They spend it kicking back with family and friends.

It doesn't matter who's left or who's come on, once your PTO was approved there is nothing they can do to change it unless you're willing.  Obviously you've made your feelings clear.  I'm not sure why they are worried, the guy has been there for 4 months and probably will be almost 5 by the time x-mas comes.  That's plenty of time to have learned how to do his job.

You could always negotiate more time off next year for those 3 days. Tell them you're having a sale and it's 1w this week and it increases by a week every week they delay :).", "NTA. \n\nYou been there and done it for a few christmases now.

You deserve a break.  And that is what I would say.  If the managers are so concerned about the new guy, let one of them work the shift.   And I would tell them, if the cold shoulder does not stop, you will have a talk with HR about a hostile work environment.", "NTA! A million time NTA. \nI work the same period over Christmas every year as I have no kids and my family lives abroad. It\u2019s no skin off my nose to cover that shift. \nBut one year my parents came back to celebrate and I booked the time off and my god did I get backlash. \u2018Didn\u2019t I want to swap so they could spend it with their families/kids\u2019 etc. I pointed out I may not have any but I am someone\u2019s kid and they want to see me so suck it up this year or I will book it off every year. \n\nThese annoying entitled devs can suck it.

He's not working Christmas, just the 3 days between the holidays.", "In restaurants, it was 2 of 5 I think between T'Day, XMas eve, Xmas, and NYE, and new year's day.\n\nI celebrate XMas eve, so did XMas and NYE.\n\nSame idea though.", "I dont get Eid off automatically. I have to put PTO in like any other days off I want.", "New guy has to pay his dues. \nI was once the new guy and had to work over the holidays, AND I was the single guy after that - spent 5 years always working Christmas. \n\n3 days when most people are not working is usually cake anyway.", "And other people can also request PTO for those days? You may find it a lot harder to take your religious holidays off, when you stop your colleagues from celebrating theirs.", "The edit says the new guy gets the 25th and 26th off. He has to cover the three days that aren't legal holidays between Christmas and New Year's.\n\nThe new guy is fine with a four-day weekend to celebrate I would think.", "It always annoys me when on AITA threads, the OP reveals major parts of the story hours after people have been posting. \n\nSo the issue isn\u2019t about taking Christmas off at all."]}
