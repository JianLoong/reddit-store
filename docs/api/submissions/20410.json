My boyfriend and I got to meet their baby boy for the first time last weekend when they came over to our flat for dinner.\n\nWe have a hot tub on our balcony that my parents gave us for Christmas last year and I had told them to bring swimwear so we could go in after dinner. \n\nMy boyfriend wasn\u2019t up for it, so he held the baby while us three got ready to get in the tub. Jenny was the last person to get changed and came out of the bathroom in a bikini.\n\nI thought she looked amazing, really happy and glowing, but Tom kind of laughed and said something about her still having some weight to lose before she\u2019d be as attractive as she was before her pregnancy.\n\nI was a bit stunned by that comment and even though Jenny didn\u2019t say anything, her smile disappeared and she looked obviously uncomfortable. She and I had talked about her struggling with weight gain during her pregnancy and I thought Tom\u2019s comment was more than insensitive.\n\nI got angry, because I started wondering what he might be saying to her in private if he was comfortable dropping lines like that in front of other people, so I responded with: \n\"She just had a baby. What\u2019s your excuse?\"\n\nThe dude has a hefty beer belly and a double chin but thinks he can joke about a new mom\u2019s weight?\n\nHe got really defensive and told me that I need to learn how to take a joke before stomping off to the hot tub. Jenny chuckled at my comment and I thought that was that, but when they left for the night, Tom pulled me aside and told me to keep my nose out of other people\u2019s business.\n\nI don\u2019t think I was entirely in the wrong but my boyfriend told me I shouldn\u2019t have reacted at all because it really wasn\u2019t my business and I think Tom\u2019s reaction speaks for itself and it makes me wonder whether I might\u2019ve been the AH in that situation.\n\nEDIT: fixed a typo", "created_utc": 1687548344, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14h7bi4/aita_for_mocking_my_friends_husbands_weight/", "score": 35, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

We call this person a bully.", "Not the asshole at all.  Sounds like she didn\u2019t love the \u201cjoke\u201d that he was trying to land.  Joke delivery is just as important as \u201ctaking a joke\u201d. Wasn\u2019t funny and you were a great friend in that moment", "NTA. Tell him to fuck off and go back to listening to Andrew Tate re-runs while drinking not-Budweiser.", "NTA.  you were just trying to stand up for friend. Besides, what kind of joke is that anyways? saying that your own wife is unattractive because she just had a baby?", "I was all set to say the opposite but NTA. \n\nYour friend\u2019s husband is a MASSIVE AH though. \n\nIf you had just randomly commented on his weight that would be one thing. But you reflecting back his idiotic and cruel insult was completely justified. Had you kept on commenting then you would have crossed a line. But one comment just reflecting back? Totally justified. \n\nAnd can I just say how much I hate it when AH say things like - just kidding! Can\u2019t you take a joke? When all they did was insult someone. That\u2019s NOT a joke. \n\nGood for you for having your friend\u2019s back.", "I don\u2019t like people fighting fat phobia with fat phobia. So I think YTA for that but NTA for defending your friend. It\u2019s possible the husband is insecure about his own weight and is deflecting onto his wife making him the biggest AH of all.", "NTA. It was the perfect response.", "NTA \n\nHe needed to know how that felt", "NTA. Don't dish it out if you can't take it.", "NTA.", "NTA at all. You\u2019re a good friend. Plus, sounds like that loser deserved it.", "NTA. In what way is that not your business? He said it in front of you making it your business. I\u2019m sus of your bf too tbh.", "NTA\n\nYou absolutely should speak up when your friend is being insulted. But you should also make sure your friend is not going to be cut off from support if her husband is abusive.", "NTA - Of course you're not the asshole. You were supporting your best friend when her husband said something extremely offensive and hurtful about her in your presence. Unless she has previously asked you to not say anything, you were being a good friend. \n\nTbh, your boyfriend sounds like the asshole. That's your best friend and he should respect your judgment of the situation more than his own. Not to mention that if your best friend didn't have anything to say about it, why didn't your boyfriend keep his own nose out of it?", "NTA. Tom can dish it out but cant take it?  Too damn bad.", "NTA and apparently not the one that can\u2019t \u2018take a joke\u2019", "NTA\nTom made it your business when he made the comment in front of you.", "I'd say NTA.
