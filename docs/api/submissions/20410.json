She and I had talked about her struggling with weight gain during her pregnancy and I thought Tom\u2019s comment was more than insensitive.\n\nI got angry, because I started wondering what he might be saying to her in private if he was comfortable dropping lines like that in front of other people, so I responded with: \n\"She just had a baby.
