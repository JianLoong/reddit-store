You should have taken her aside and said that. Instead you just set flames to the situation and left a poor girl to sort it out. The problem is not that you told her, the problem is that by telling her you threw her to the wolves. You have no idea about what she loses during the confrontation, yet you imposed your decision on her. Who payed for her trip, does she have a place for the night if not with them, can she return home safely.\nYour actions put her in a potentially risky situation, because you couldn't be bothered to think one step forward.\nSo, not AH for the fact you told her, but a total AH for doing it in front of her \"friends\".", "NTA. You went out of your way to do a kind thing for a stranger. Good for you.", "YTA. \n\nI think you meant well.  But now what.  She has to stay on a trip with these people after a big blow up? You say they are young, so chances are she can't afford to stay on her own (nor would that be wise), or fly home early.   This is the epitome of you throwing a grenade and walking away, not caring about the mess you left in your wake. \n\nAlso, lets be real, people get annoyed with each other when traveling.  I've travelled with my best friend quite a bit.  I'm sure I've shit talked him.  In fact, I know I have.   But there is context with everything.  I shit talk him, and he annoys me, but I still love the guy.   \n\nYou eavesdropped on part of a conversation, with no context, and decided to cause a mess that you aren't going to have to deal with the aftermath", "NTA \n\nI think you did the right thing, but you definitely ruined Hannah\u2019s vacation in the process and that\u2019s sad.", "NTA, fake friends are manipulative little craps and getting hints about them sooner is best. This Hannah person probably didn't know she was the brunt of so much crap.", "NTA\n\nI'd give you a gold star if I had one.", "NTA. They wanna talk, gotta be prepared for that info to be shared", "NTA you seem like a kind and honest person and even if the trip will maybe have an unpleasant ending you saved her from future disappointments \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb", "NTA. While you did probably ruin her trip, she deserves to know what kind of friends she has.", "NTA - And good on you for telling her.  Those friends are toxic and she would do well to find that out sooner rather than later.  Friendship break ups are always painful, but I've been the friend in the group that kind of felt there was hostility but was always told I was being crazy.  I bet poor Hannah has already experienced the same and wasn't totally surprised by this news.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPeople can be cruel and sometimes mean girls can escalate and make life hell for someone trying to prove they're a good friend.  It takes a while before the person looks around and realizes no one has said anything nice to her or about her for a few years.  This slow burn is hellish and awful.  \n\nAlso, I just keep thinking of that group of friends that went to Mexico and murdered the girl they didn't like.  If someone had been kind enough to let her know they secretly hated her, her life might not have been taken.  People want to think this type of talk is just petty and small, but it always escalates to some seriously heinous shit if not discovered early.", "NTA!!!!!", "NTA. Having been in a friend group where I found out that a percentage hated me and the others didn\u2019t feel comfortable standing up to them\u2026I\u2019d have appreciated knowing how my \u201cfriends\u201d felt earlier. Could have saved myself a lot of heartache.", "YTA. I know you meant well for Hannah's sake, and in general it would be good for her to know that. The problem is that dropping that information on her while they were together was guaranteed to start a fight. If they were on vacation, it likely ruined the trip and created unavoidable tension as they are stuck traveling together.  It probably would have been better to find out some other way.", "100 p the asshole say something to the girls if anything u don\u2019t know the relationship or if Hannah talks to the other two abt one girl when they leave u just don\u2019t know enough", "YTA. Now she's stuck in Italy and you have ruined her vacation.  Not her friends, you, by not minding your own business.", "YTA - mind your business. While comments were notably unsavory. You\u2019ve run ones a trip for her and them when you could have minded your business and trusted that Hannah would wise up. You placed yourself in harms way as well. People are unhinged and people who would trash their openly may not be the kind you want to offend. Just my thought.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She will surely find a way around", "went out of your way to do it in a public way that ruins everyone\u2019s vacation. \n\nOP basically dropped a bomb on them and then ran away from the fallout.

She can't be sure Hannah wouldn't be kicked to the street by the same \"friends\" and she just started the confrontation", "Who cares? Why should those people have a good trip when they invited someone they don\u2019t even like? Fuck them. I\u2019m sure it was awkward but how do you think the girl feels? It\u2019s gonna suck for her but ignorance is not bliss here. Fake friends are terrible.", "When they speak badly of their friend in public they shouldn\u2019t be surprised that other overhear it and that the confrontation is in public as well", "Was gonna skip this post but honestly this is dumb as fuck. What makes them deserving of a good trip when they\u2019re talking shit about one of them? Should\u2019ve went without them. Foh with that bs", "Because being on a trip while there is a bunch of drama isn't fun for ANYONE, even Hannah", "But now Hannah doesn't get a good trip either. It's going to suck whenever she finds out, but it's going to be so much worse if she has to spend several days with them or change flights to go home and throw away everything she spent on the trip.", "NTA but you could\u2019ve been far more strategic. You put her in a vulnerable spot by revealing your hand in front of her friends, who now know she knows.", "YTA because you left this foreign chick, stuck overseas with people she now knows doesn\u2019t like her. \n\nWill they kick her out of the hotel? Have you tainted the entire trip now? \n\nAlso, you have no idea of the dynamic of their friend group either. I have bitched about my friends and partners and family at points of frustration. Doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t love them. Means I\u2019m venting. \n\nAlso, how do you know Hannah is a perfect angel and doesn\u2019t do the same thing when \u201cAbby\u201d or \u201cBrittney\u201d goes to the bathroom??", "NTA she probably knew deep down and you validated her worries. Hope she moves on and finds better friends", "Agreed! OP is NTA for saying it. But how she proceeded with it can turn out disastrous for the girl for the short term as it was revealed infront of the other girls. But probably she will be thanking you in the long run.", "Without context? Idc what the context is, they specifically asked for warning when she was coming so they could stop absolutely trashing her. For crying??? There is no context where that's not awful. Stop defending shitty people and blaming a good honest person. Op is nta. You are.", "Ahh. I think I misread \"while she was in the bathroom\" to mean that she told her in the bathroom, not when she got back.\n\nI still don't think OP was TA here. The \"friends\" were. There feasibly wouldn't be any other way she would have found out that her friends were treating her so poorly as soon as she gets outside of earshot (not even fully gone.)", "If some rando in another country asked to speak to me privately, I would NOT have listened. Unfortunately, the choices were \"tell her in front of her friends\" or \"don't tell her anything\"", "And I get that and I have no issue with the bad friends suffering. My issue is that her efforts to help Hannah effectively ruined any chance of her enjoying the vacation as well. She just came out of the restroom and was handed a fight.", "Stepping literally couple of steps away and lowering your voice or intercepting her on the way from the washroom are both valid options", "Sometimes saying nothing is the better option.  \n\nIt doesn't sound like Hannah was in any actual danger."]}
