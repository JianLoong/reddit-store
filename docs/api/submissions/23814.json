You should have taken her aside and said that. Instead you just set flames to the situation and left a poor girl to sort it out. The problem is not that you told her, the problem is that by telling her you threw her to the wolves. You have no idea about what she loses during the confrontation, yet you imposed your decision on her. Who payed for her trip, does she have a place for the night if not with them, can she return home safely.\nYour actions put her in a potentially risky situation, because you couldn't be bothered to think one step forward.\nSo, not AH for the fact you told her, but a total AH for doing it in front of her \"friends\".", "NTA. You went out of your way to do a kind thing for a stranger. Good for you.", "YTA. \n\nI think you meant well.  But now what.  She has to stay on a trip with these people after a big blow up? You say they are young, so chances are she can't afford to stay on her own (nor would that be wise), or fly home early.   This is the epitome of you throwing a grenade and walking away, not caring about the mess you left in your wake. \n\nAlso, lets be real, people get annoyed with each other when traveling.  I've travelled with my best friend quite a bit.  I'm sure I've shit talked him.  In fact, I know I have.   But there is context with everything.  I shit talk him, and he annoys me, but I still love the guy.   \n\nYou eavesdropped on part of a conversation, with no context, and decided to cause a mess that you aren't going to have to deal with the aftermath", "NTA \n\nI think you did the right thing, but you definitely ruined Hannah\u2019s vacation in the process and that\u2019s sad.", "NTA, fake friends are manipulative little craps and getting hints about them sooner is best. This Hannah person probably didn't know she was the brunt of so much crap.", "NTA\n\nI'd give you a gold star if I had one.", "NTA. They wanna talk, gotta be prepared for that info to be shared", "NTA you seem like a kind and honest person and even if the trip will maybe have an unpleasant ending you saved her from future disappointments \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb", "NTA. While you did probably ruin her trip, she deserves to know what kind of friends she has.", "NTA - And good on you for telling her.  Those friends are toxic and she would do well to find that out sooner rather than later.  Friendship break ups are always painful, but I've been the friend in the group that kind of felt there was hostility but was always told I was being crazy.  I bet poor Hannah has already experienced the same and wasn't totally surprised by this news.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPeople can be cruel and sometimes mean girls can escalate and make life hell for someone trying to prove they're a good friend.  It takes a while before the person looks around and realizes no one has said anything nice to her or about her for a few years.  This slow burn is hellish and awful.  \n\nAlso, I just keep thinking of that group of friends that went to Mexico and murdered the girl they didn't like.  If someone had been kind enough to let her know they secretly hated her, her life might not have been taken.  People want to think this type of talk is just petty and small, but it always escalates to some seriously heinous shit if not discovered early.", "NTA!!!!!", "NTA. Having been in a friend group where I found out that a percentage hated me and the others didn\u2019t feel comfortable standing up to them\u2026I\u2019d have appreciated knowing how my \u201cfriends\u201d felt earlier. Could have saved myself a lot of heartache.", "YTA. I know you meant well for Hannah's sake, and in general it would be good for her to know that. The problem is that dropping that information on her while they were together was guaranteed to start a fight. If they were on vacation, it likely ruined the trip and created unavoidable tension as they are stuck traveling together.  It probably would have been better to find out some other way.", "100 p the asshole say something to the girls if anything u don\u2019t know the relationship or if Hannah talks to the other two abt one girl when they leave u just don\u2019t know enough", "YTA. Now she's stuck in Italy and you have ruined her vacation.  Not her friends, you, by not minding your own business.", "YTA - mind your business. While comments were notably unsavory. You\u2019ve run ones a trip for her and them when you could have minded your business and trusted that Hannah would wise up. You placed yourself in harms way as well. People are unhinged and people who would trash their openly may not be the kind you want to offend. Just my thought.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Why should those people have a good trip when they invited someone they don\u2019t even like? Fuck them. I\u2019m sure it was awkward but how do you think the girl feels? It\u2019s gonna suck for her but ignorance is not bliss here.

You put her in a vulnerable spot by revealing your hand in front of her friends, who now know she knows.", "YTA because you left this foreign chick, stuck overseas with people she now knows doesn\u2019t like her. \n\nWill they kick her out of the hotel? Have you tainted the entire trip now? \n\nAlso, you have no idea of the dynamic of their friend group either. I have bitched about my friends and partners and family at points of frustration. Doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t love them. Means I\u2019m venting. \n\nAlso, how do you know Hannah is a perfect angel and doesn\u2019t do the same thing when \u201cAbby\u201d or \u201cBrittney\u201d goes to the bathroom??", "NTA she probably knew deep down and you validated her worries. Hope she moves on and finds better friends", "Agreed! OP is NTA for saying it. But how she proceeded with it can turn out disastrous for the girl for the short term as it was revealed infront of the other girls. But probably she will be thanking you in the long run.", "Without context? Idc what the context is, they specifically asked for warning when she was coming so they could stop absolutely trashing her. For crying??? There is no context where that's not awful. Stop defending shitty people and blaming a good honest person. Op is nta. You are.", "Ahh. I think I misread \"while she was in the bathroom\" to mean that she told her in the bathroom, not when she got back.\n\nI still don't think OP was TA here. The \"friends\" were.

Now she has to deal with the fallout in a foreign country likely staying in the same accommodations.", "NTA\n\nI'd want to know if it had been me, and it probably has been at times in my past.\n\nNot great execution, but it saved her from carrying the knowledge around, festering, wondering what she should do.\nHeck, maybe they worked it out faster this way.", "YTA!  Big time.\n\nHow vicious can you be? Trying to excuse your cruelty by saying she should know and you would want to know doesn't work. This poor kid is now left all alone in a foreign country with people you outed as hating her.", "My first thought was \"& now she's alone in a foreign country with these people.\" & it was one thing for them to hate her in secret and her not know, it's a completely different thing now that she knows how they feel.

Telling her with her \u2018friends\u2019 present means they had to immediately defend themselves against the accusations.", "YTA.  You overheard a conversation among strangers and thought you should butt in.  You should have minded your own business and let them sort it out.  \n\nSo you said that \"you would want to know\" in the same situation?  Well, that's you, and not some young girl you've never met.", "Why couldn't OP have followed her to the bathroom and let her know privately?  Seems like a better solution than blowing up the friend group", "NTA. Awful but you almost had to do it in front of them. Excruciating for Hannah but better she know. My heart breaks for her.", "Soft YTA. I know you were trying to do a good thing, but you only set her up to be mistreated to her face rather than behind her back. You were right to tell her, but you shouldn't have done it in front of the people who obviously hate her. If you'd told her privately, you wouldn't have been TA at all.", "YTA. You put her in a really bad position by telling her that in front if the people talking about her and then bouncing. Why didn't you go find her in the bathroom instead? You were thinking about what you would want, not what SHE would need.", "YTA. \n\nYou caused a huge blow up between these random people because you blindly walked into a conversation that wasn\u2019t your business in the first place. You didn\u2019t know if they had a valid reason to dislike her. I would want to know if I was being shit talked too, but maybe not in a different country on vacation. I guarantee the ride to the hotel and the rest of the night for Hannah was miserable. That was not your place at all.", "NTA for telling her but dumb move to do it in front of them. Should have pulled her aside and let her know so she could deal with that information as she saw fit, deep down she probably already knew\u2026 She\u2019s likely the one helping fund the trip.", "Imagine being abroad and finding out your friends hate you. I had to find out via discord. A real friend told me the group I was hanging out with hated me and was talking shit. I guess I was needy during the pandemic. I left the group once I found out but I wish they had just said they didn't like me so I could leave sooner. I can't do discord since tbh. If all those folks decided to pretend to be her friend just to hate on her then she deserved to know and so did I. I hope she left and found people who really liked her. I did. And fuck that obscure  discord channel that decided to pretend to be my friend and treat me like shit. \n\nY'all, just say you don't like someone. A normal person like me will just leave. You don't have to run them off with ill behavior or kill them like the latest true crime doc I saw on YouTube. \"Oh we hated her so we killed her\" they pretended to be her best friend and they murdered her. \n\nYou can just be an adult and have friends you do like . Don't fucking pr\u00e9tend and act like that doesn't hurt anyone.", "In a foreign country? I sure hope you're right", "YTA Op for being interfering busybody.\n\nYou sound like those old ladies who insert themselves into other people's situations without any foresight.     \n\nYou Just made Hannah vulnerable in her group and left.      \n\nYou have no knowledge of how long Hannah is on this trip for,  \n\nOr what is there living situation. \n\nOr does she have any recourse to go home.  \n\nOr how uncomfortable it's going to be for her being amongst them, does she even have money or options to get a separate room.   \n\nYou wouldn't have got the yta if you had told hannah privately but you did it in front her friends without any idea of the fallout.", "NTA for telling her the truth about her \"friends\".  However, YTA for telling her in front of them. I mean seriously, why would you do that?  That's basically you starting a raging fire and letting that young woman deal with it.", "YTA for telling her in front of everyone ffs! You should have taken her aside or something, which would have at least given her the space to think about how she may handle the situation. I actually think you were pretty irresponsible by doing it that way.", "Op is definitely YTA she just threw a hand grenade into the group and left.   \n\nShe doesn't know the dynamics of the group.   \n\nHannah is 3 against 1, she doesn't know what options Hannah has, how long she still has on this trip with them.", "I re-skimmed the post and it doesn't say if OP was a woman, so it's possible if it was a man, they couldn't have followed or even waited outside the bathroom without seeming predatory", "Op is the AH for how they went about it. There\u2019s so many other options rather than telling her in the moment. Op doesn\u2019t know how long they were there for, how long they have left, or any other context.\n\nThey just told the poor woman and then left her to deal with the fallout. It\u2019s not a kind thing for a stranger, when you aren\u2019t sure what the outcome will be of your decision. \n\nOp made a snap decision based on their feelings and applied it to someone else. And it doesn\u2019t make sense to say there wasn\u2019t any other feasible way. Sure,  in that *moment* there wasn\u2019t one but that doesn\u2019t mean she never would\u2019ve."]}
