He can build a fence on his yard", "YTA, you are trying to force him to build the fence closer to his house by not letting him demolish the existing house.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with him using construction fence on your side while the original fence is demolished and replaced in its original spot.", "Yeah, I think you are right.", "Yeah, I think he wants to move it onto our property and then try to convince the city to let him build two houses instead of one.", "Thank you, I agree with you.  It is not actually a shared fence though.  The neighbor gave it to us when we moved in because he did not want to pay for maintenance and repair.", "Yes, but the lawyer said that fence line has been there for 40 years so it is the property line now regardless of any survey.  It is really close to the survey though, within a few inches either way.  If I let the neighbor replace it, it will be moved to my side, I am pretty sure about that.", "It doesn't block the dust and noise.  Are you saying I should put up with that?  Plus I am pretty sure he plans on moving the fence so that he has some of our  property, would that be OK with you?  Just asking, thank you for your response.", "Ok so from experience, fence line and property lines are vastly different.  Fence lines mean nothing.", "You get a brand new fence.  I would be fine with the construction fence if I had timelines for completion.  I would be very insistent on it being on the property line or on his side.  I\u2019d insist on a 3rd party survey to mark the locations.\n\nBut you being hung up on the dust seems unreasonable.", "Look up the legal doctrine of adverse possession. \n\nGiven the number of years, this fence is now the property line.", "Depends on where he lives. In my state after twenty years the fence becomes the property line regardless of what the previous survey may have stated.", "Ok I know now, no need to downvote.  I get it.", "My fence is two years old, I like it already.  My question is, why are they so insistent on replacing a two year old fence and why do they want it down for so long?  The most likely answer is that they will move it .  If they try to tear it down without permission, it is a criminal matter.  if I agree, I would have to sue them to get it moved back.  But thank you for your response.", "Yep, that is what the lawyer said.", "Same, and it has been 40 years at least.", "Ok thank you I had no idea.", "Question?  So new owners to a property similar to this situation, must accept this?", "Why haven\u2019t you asked them why they want to put in a new fence?", "I can\u2019t wait to tell my property law professor from my first year of law school (I just started my third year today!) that I actually retained something from property law next time I see her on campus \ud83d\ude02", "That is what my lawyer said about my area.  But the law is different in different places.", "They would not answer that, they just kept repeating their request.  The lawyer said they were planning on moving it so that they could talk the city into an extra house.  This was also based on the wording of the agreement they tried to get me to sign, it would have made moving the fence into my property legal.", "I believe you!  Im just worried my asshole neighbor who has had his fence on my property before I moved in\n14 yo ago\nWould\nHave any rights?\nNot pursuing but just incase.", "In my state, that would now be the property line.", "Well I wish you the best.  It\u2019s beyond my knowledge.  Fences make good neighbors."]}
