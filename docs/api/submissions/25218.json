He can build a fence on his yard", "YTA, you are trying to force him to build the fence closer to his house by not letting him demolish the existing house.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with him using construction fence on your side while the original fence is demolished and replaced in its original spot.", "Yeah, I think you are right.", "Yeah, I think he wants to move it onto our property and then try to convince the city to let him build two houses instead of one.", "Thank you, I agree with you.  It is not actually a shared fence though.  The neighbor gave it to us when we moved in because he did not want to pay for maintenance and repair.", "Yes, but the lawyer said that fence line has been there for 40 years so it is the property line now regardless of any survey.  It is really close to the survey though, within a few inches either way.  If I let the neighbor replace it, it will be moved to my side, I am pretty sure about that.", "It doesn't block the dust and noise.  Are you saying I should put up with that?  Plus I am pretty sure he plans on moving the fence so that he has some of our  property, would that be OK with you?  Just asking, thank you for your response.", "[deleted]", "You get a brand new fence.  I would be fine with the construction fence if I had timelines for completion.

In my state after twenty years the fence becomes the property line regardless of what the previous survey may have stated.", "Ok I know now, no need to downvote.  I get it.", "My fence is two years old, I like it already.  My question is, why are they so insistent on replacing a two year old fence and why do they want it down for so long?  The most likely answer is that they will move it .  If they try to tear it down without permission, it is a criminal matter.  if I agree, I would have to sue them to get it moved back.  But thank you for your response.", "Yep, that is what the lawyer said.", "Same, and it has been 40 years at least.", "Ok thank you I had no idea.", "Question?  So new owners to a property similar to this situation, must accept this?", "Why haven\u2019t you asked them why they want to put in a new fence?", "I can\u2019t wait to tell my property law professor from my first year of law school (I just started my third year today!) that I actually retained something from property law next time I see her on campus \ud83d\ude02", "That is what my lawyer said about my area.  But the law is different in different places.", "They would not answer that, they just kept repeating their request.  The lawyer said they were planning on moving it so that they could talk the city into an extra house.  This was also based on the wording of the agreement they tried to get me to sign, it would have made moving the fence into my property legal.", "I believe you!  Im just worried my asshole neighbor who has had his fence on my property before I moved in\n14 yo ago\nWould\nHave any rights?\nNot pursuing but just incase.", "In my state, that would now be the property line.", "Well I wish you the best.

About six feet from my back property line is a stone wall that's been there since 1886.  That six feet still belongs to the neighbor.", "Nta.  Stick to your guns here", "NTA, to me it seems they want to move move the fence to make more space for construction work but also possibly to claim some of the land. You are completely in the right though, you should not have to suffer because of your neighbors construction.", "NTA - Your terms are perfectly reasonable given the possible problems you would have to experience if not done to your terms.  What they desire is what would be easiest and financially beneficial to them and not for you.  Common fences are shared between neighbors in costs and usage.  It is not fair that only one side benefits while the other does not.  Stick to your guns as they have no other recourse.", "NTA", "Not lazy.", "Depending on where the property line is they could make the neighbors pay to have the fence moved. Of course that will be a long and annoying court fight so better to just not give permission.", "Whose side of the property line is it on though?", "I don't think the neighbor can just \"give\" you the fence informally like that. It's the fence on the property line? Is it on his property or yours? Depending on your location, there are different laws governing who \"owns\" a fence, especially if it sits exactly on the property line. You might want to get a survey and research the laws in your area.", "Mine.", "The lawyer said it was my fence and on my property. The fence became the property line years ago via adverse possession.  The fence also became mine because I have solely maintained and repaired it.  The neighbor is not disputing this.", "FWIW, if your town or city has a fence siter (We have someone in the building inspectors office that specializes in fences), I would invite them down. At the bare minimum, I would take pictures like mad, because if you come home one day and the fence has been removed, you will have evidence of what exactly they have to replace.", "NTA", "NTA The only reason why they would need a red fence is because they need a gap in the fence for something. A gap to come onto your land and squish your plants etc while they do their work. They can pay you for that privilege.", "Why not both?", "Sounds like you're all squared away then. NTA", "Yep. They are trying to steal your land and were hoping to pull a bait and switch. And a 2 year old fence doesn't need replacing. Be wary and watchful of \"oopsies\" during demolition and construction.  They're not going to give up that easily.

Neighbor is TA.", "NTA.", "The construction fence might even be legally required (depending on the local building laws).", "Unless it sits right on the property line, then it isn't a shared fence.

Sounds like he had this wonderful vision of adding $$$ to his house and now that he can't do what he wants with other people's property, he's not going to make as much as he wants.  Tough shit, Jerry.", "NTA. Jerry needs to build on his own lot, not yours.", "Nta", "NTA\n\nFirst it's wanting the fence to be an inch on your property, and next they'll try to push it farther. They'll simply have to deal with things the way they are. He wants another fence, he can put it on his side.", "This would be a good time to have your property surveyed by your own survey company.  This way you can be sure that the property lines are where you think they are.", "A fence that was there for 40 years means the property line is moved? I don\u2019t get it \u2026. Neighbor should Survey the property, sounds like the fence is more on his property then yours? You\u2019ve gained a few inches illegally? How does an old fence trump a property line?", "Adverse possession. If the fence has been in that location for more than 10 years and is set back on the neighbor's side of the property line, all of the land on OP's side between the fence and the actual property line legally becomes OP's property. It's why you should never let anyone use even a small piece of your property as they will eventually have a legal claim to that land. Similarly, if someone's kids have been using a trail to cut through your property for years, they can eventually be granted a prescriptive easement which means you can't forbid them from cutting through your land.\n\nETA: 10 years is the standard in most states to claim adverse possession, but the total number of years can vary from location to location.", "That is the law in our area, is it not illegal.  The fence is on the properly line though within a few inches either way.  I never said it was more on his property than mine.", "Sorry if I explained it poorly, lawyer says we own it.  I have no reason to doubt them, they are the top property lawyers in our area.", "It could be that OP means there was a case for adverse possession on both sides, but they agreed to drop it and came to an agreement to settle the matter.", "I have no real doubt you own it, just saying you should understand why you do.", "That isn't really how adverse possession works - you can't openly and notoriously adversely occupy the same land at the same time, or else both claims fail. In any case, the settlement would also have to be registered if it affects a person's rights in land. If it happened properly, it would come out in the land survey.", "There was never an agreement about the land so you are in error.", "I'm not in error, I'm just responding to a hypothetical that happens not to be your situation."]}
