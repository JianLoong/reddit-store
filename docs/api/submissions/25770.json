If your father is not receiving medical intervention(chemo) anymore -he should be in hospice.

This is so hard for her\u2026 I know from experience\u2026 and these are such scary words and I am sure she is frightened. I cared for my mother as she was dying and hospice gives so much more support and peace than a hospital. I think you should talk to a hospice person to get fully informed and then you can sit with your mom and the hospice person together so she will have 2 people to explain things to her. Hospice professionals\u2019 whole purpose is to empathetically help people like your mom who are shying from the reality that the person they love is slipping away.", "NTA - Before starting I want to give my condolences to you and your family.\n\nTry compromising with your mom.

The other option is to not move.\n\nLook at a residential hospice or palliative care facility.  I'm not sure what care facilities you looked at but they may not have been for what you needed.

I'd feel like we're tied to being home, and we have tons of Dr appointments these days, things to prepare for our family, etc...", "Merica.

I don't feel that is right.", "Serious question: Are there no hospices in the US?\n\nIf the care facilities will no longer take him because they can't provide the care he requires, it means his needs have gone up, and the requirements to meet those needs are similarly raised. \n\nMoving from a care facility back home is a step backwards: if Mom couldn't handle looking after him months ago, she can't handle looking after him now.\n\nThat doesn't mean that the answer is that she moves him in with you.  She's being a bit disingenuous/in denial to suggest that it will be fine for him to be with you because she'll be there during the day - when she's not having a break. What happens at night with her plan? Nursing care is 24/7 - the patient doesn't stop needing care because Mum has gone home.\n\nI'm really sorry, OP.

We went through something similar with my mother as she passed from lung cancer.\n\nHospice was amazing.  A caretaker came in regularly to answer questions, check on health needs and just give support overall.  My mother was still aware at first, professionals also volunteered their time for things like massages and reiki treatments.  They also gave support to us as the family.  In addition, they gave us things like hospital beds and wheelchairs.\n\nFinally they helped us know when the end was truly near.  They transported her by ambulance to a local hospital with a hospice wing where she was able to pass peacefully.\n\nYour mother does not get to abdicate responsibility and hold back important supports, you are currently his daily caretaker.

They provide end-of-life care for the terminally ill, generally at no cost to the patient or family.\n\nIn my case they provided the equipment (bed, oxygen concentrator) and medications that allowed my mother to spend her last weeks at home with my brother and I, with either a nurse or skilled aide coming daily M-F to assist with her care and on-cal 24/7 if we had any questions or concerns. They were a tremendous blessing, and it did not cost us one cent.\n\nThey also had the option of a hospice facility, also free of charge, where 24/7 care is provided by professionals. It sounds as though this would be the best environment for your father, and you and your mother would be allowed to visit him there.\n\nThe key is that hospice care is end of life care. No attempts are made to prolong life; the goal is to keep the patient comfortable. Food, fluids & medications for pain, difficulty breathing, anxiety & such are given, but no lifesaving measures will be taken. It can be difficult to make that decision, but it really sounds as though this would be your best option if it is available.\n\nPlease encourage your mother to consider it if it is. It's not giving up on your father or abandoning him; it is putting him in the care of professionals who can provide the best care for him at this point in his life and ease a burden that none of you are truly qualified to carry,", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like you need to look at other solutions.\n\nI mean - will your mother have to move when your dad passes? \n\nMaybe she's trying to avoid that, understandably.

The folks who work hospice are amazing and try to ease people's way through dying. Hospice is not long-term care, it's end of life care.\n\nHasn't the hospital/doctor given you information for a social worker who could help you set it up? Medical social workers do this kind of thing in their sleep. I went through cancer treatments and the social worker helped line up services I could use.\n\nNTA", "NTA. There is in home hospice care nursing available. What \"emergency\" could your father have that your mother fears? He is dying. He will die. Death is not an emergency in this case. If his feeding tube gets dislodged, she should be trained on how to fix it if she is his caretaker.", "I'm sorry for your situation but why would you have to sell the house if your dad dies there?", "NTA your mom is not afraid. She\u2019s not stupid. She wants a break and wants you two to care for your dad while she rests.  \nHe has a home with mom. He needs to live there and die there happily. Stand your ground. Be stern and just say no.  Mom will get hospice people when am redes, but in the mean time she can get providers for him to help her.  Say NO!", "NTA you may have to remind your mother she married him in sickness and in health and you will support them both as much as you can but, he is her \"responsibility\" not yours.\n\nTell her you love her, you are 5 minutes away but Dad is coming home to her not to you and your wife and soon to be baby.", "I think the main reason being the 24/7 carer for your dad isn\u2019t possible is your baby to be. Middle of the night - babies screaming /needing care in one room, dad falls over in another potentially not found for hours. It\u2019s 1000% not practical", "I may get downvoted for this but this was exactly my take and the vows of 'in sickness and in health' he is ultimately her responsibility. OP has their own family to think of and is there very close by to help.   \nOP's Mother is going to have to accept he needs to be at her home and I'd say he'd rather pass there.   \nI am sorry a home won't take him OP, that's awful NTA", "Because they don\u2019t want to live in a home where someone died. Okay?! They have a right not to.", "This is what hospice care is for. They will either be at your parents' house daily (if that's what's called for), or there are often hospice facilities for end of life care. Their focus is on making the patient as comfortable as possible.", "Nah, your mom wants to put the responsibility on you. She\u2019s not stupid, she knows what she\u2019s doing. Don\u2019t let her.  He can get a provider to help. If he falls off bed call you or an  ambulance", "So she will move when he dies in their house...?\n\nAnyway, I was going to suggest that maybe, you could move to your parents' for this late stage, as it is likely to last just a few months. That way, your mother would not be alone, and you wouldn't end up with a \"tainted\" house. And your wife is also just 5 minutes away if anything happens and you need to go to her.", "If the house she is living in existed before she lived there, then most likely someone has died in it. Also I thought a big part of most religions was teaching acceptance of life and death? \n\nRegardless, NTA, if the plan was always for her to be the main carer then he should never have been with you. I would advise getting a nurse or some sort of outside help though - just watching someone go through what your dad is is traumatic, never mind everything that is entailed by looking after them", "See your mom is manipulative, not religious.", "Not true. She is not stupid. She is selfish and conniving. She wants no responsibility. You would be an asshole if you let your dying dad in. He needs to die in his own home on his own bed in peace. Not elsewhere. He is not an object that should be bounced around. What ever happen to dignity and respect?!!!", "Ok, so it is a thing there as well. I would have been surprised if not, but then I'm often surprised by how bonkers the US health care system is.\n\nI hope OP sees the comments about hospice care. It's not about \"giving up,\" it's about giving the patient the care they need. From the post, OPs father can't/won't get the care he needs at either home.", "Well, I'm sorry to say this but..... Neither you nor your mother want your father to die at home, whether her house or yours.  So hospice is the only practical solution where he can be given a dignified, loving chance to pass.", "Nah. She doesn\u2019t want to deal with him. That\u2019s it. She wants her life back to go about as she pleases. That\u2019s it. She wants to dump him in you.", "No and it\u2019s a shame to let him suffer because of the mothers fears/pride!"]}
