If your father is not receiving medical intervention(chemo) anymore -he should be in hospice.

This is so hard for her\u2026 I know from experience\u2026 and these are such scary words and I am sure she is frightened. I cared for my mother as she was dying and hospice gives so much more support and peace than a hospital. I think you should talk to a hospice person to get fully informed and then you can sit with your mom and the hospice person together so she will have 2 people to explain things to her. Hospice professionals\u2019 whole purpose is to empathetically help people like your mom who are shying from the reality that the person they love is slipping away.", "NTA - Before starting I want to give my condolences to you and your family.\n\nTry compromising with your mom.

The other option is to not move.\n\nLook at a residential hospice or palliative care facility.  I'm not sure what care facilities you looked at but they may not have been for what you needed.

I don't feel that is right.", "Serious question: Are there no hospices in the US?\n\nIf the care facilities will no longer take him because they can't provide the care he requires, it means his needs have gone up, and the requirements to meet those needs are similarly raised. \n\nMoving from a care facility back home is a step backwards: if Mom couldn't handle looking after him months ago, she can't handle looking after him now.\n\nThat doesn't mean that the answer is that she moves him in with you.  She's being a bit disingenuous/in denial to suggest that it will be fine for him to be with you because she'll be there during the day - when she's not having a break.

My mother was still aware at first, professionals also volunteered their time for things like massages and reiki treatments.  They also gave support to us as the family.  In addition, they gave us things like hospital beds and wheelchairs.\n\nFinally they helped us know when the end was truly near.  They transported her by ambulance to a local hospital with a hospice wing where she was able to pass peacefully.\n\nYour mother does not get to abdicate responsibility and hold back important supports, you are currently his daily caretaker.

I am an exoert in thus (sadly) and have added 2 deaths in the past 3 weeks (dad and aunt) I hope mb the advice on banking may hell. Also mb it is too late to do a plan for your dad- but mb your mom would be open to moving to a senior facility in the \u201cindependent living wing\u201d (like a dorm for seniors here in FL!! It might put your mind and hers at rest as to what will happen to her when your dad is gone  She may fear she will be left behind or viewed as extraneous. Mb that is why she wants to place Dad w/ you- along with the reasons you mentioned. It may be subconscious- but these issues are complex. The conversations are tough. But better now than in an urgent/emergency setting. Wishing you a measure of peace plus much joy in parenthood! Pls excuse my typos. \n\nCall hospice. I had 8 losses in 18 mos (glioblastoma, dementia, prostate cancer x2, pancreatic cancer, heart failure, aortic dissection and old age-101!) \n\nAll utilized hospice. Some at home, some in long term care residential facilities, 2 in hospitals. They are unbelievably kind/helpful/supportive. I hope you have gotten them involved. My aunt (cancer-18 mos.)  stayed at home until last 3 days of her life. She started w/ a 1/week visit, progressed to 3X/week and then (last 60 days) had daily nurse visits. Was a lifesaver. We could focus on being together while they managed meds, IVs, oxygen, care, etc.! When she (and others) moved to the\u201dhospice house\u201d  facility fir their final days (average 3-5) it was peaceful/kind. Was done in our cases to allow full access to pain drugs. \n\nA few tips/thoughts. \n1. PLEASE do not allow your mother to try to guilt you into housing your father. It us not fair or reasonable. Talk about hospice. They will bill insurance but it allows access to care at home which might otherwise be out of reach for many. If your mom & dad have the resources- INSIST they use them. Do not back down. Support your mom but protect your wife, growing family and home. \n2. URGENT- BANKING\nMy (other) aunt died Sunday leaving me to administer things as she had no kids. The mail arrived w/ a credit card bilk, property taxes on her rental property and 1 other bilk. Total-about 16K bc the cc bill had her skilled nursing bill on it. She believed she had \u201cplanned well\u201d bc she set up a trust. But guess what- she refused to put anyone on her bank account-even as \u201cpayable on death.\u201d So all accounts are frozen until probate. Well the bills still exist. So I have 2 choices- front the money and seek reimbursement from the estate (a BIG pill to swallow w/ a freshman in college) OR delay. Delaying means putting yhe bilks on hold until the autopsy is finished, she is cremated and the death certificate is issued. Then we will begin to get the trust process moving and I will be authorized to act. The issue- the interest rate for a deferral - 29.98% and death did not get me a break!!!!!!!!! \n\nHopefully your parents have joint accounts- but it us imperative that someone is able to access resources to pay electric/water bilks. \n\n3. FUNERAL HOMES- most are now owned by large conglomerates. They may still bear a well-known local name bc that name is an asset & brings people in. But DO NOT BE FOOLED. When my dad died in July I wanted a \u201cdirect cremation.\u201d I calked 2 \u201clong term\u201d places, a new service I was unfamiliar with and 1 we had used once. Turns out all but the 1 small one were cirp owned. The prices ranged from 1.5K-2.7K MORE for the exact same service. They also ALL use 1 county facility. The do not cremate or embalm \u201con-site.\u201d They transport to the facility where ALL local companies work and then you puck up the remains or arrange for burial through the \u201cstorefront.\u201d PLEASE investigate in your town!!!!!! You can have a beautiful funeral- but paying double (or more) for the prep services felt wrong yo me. The place we used was a small business- so kind and gracious! Using again. \n\n 4. You are right. Care IS a mess. And many people don\u2019t know. I live in FL (gulf coast.) We have gorgeous facilities (like a Ritz) and pretty ones (Marriott) and lesser ones (unbranded economy.) The last still costs $15K/mo for round the click care (not paid by Medicare after one exhausts the lifetime limit- which us short.) But to get in the nice facilities when you NEED \u201cskilled nursing\u201d, memory care or assistance, you must have already moved in when you were INDEPENDENT!!!!! So the goal is to \u201cage in place.\u201d The nice facilities will only offer beds to residents whose needs have progressed. SURPRISE. So if a person wants to live at home, they better pray no illness or accident arrives. Bc at thst point it is game over (in FL.) I am 50. I am seriously thinking of buying a 2bedroom IndependentLiving apt at 55 or 60. I am healthy. But I do not want to live in the economy style facility bc it turns out I wait to long, stay stubbornly at home and miss my window. Have seen that movie. Dirty caroet, moaning residents, sepsis, germs and all (again - for \u201clow\u201d cost of $15K/mo!\nOfc if a person CAN stay home- great. But it is a crapshoot and it will be too late for many who hope to stay at home but WILL need  care at some point but will not have (many or mb any) choice on location.", "NTA.

Even outside their open hours. We have no doubt she would be coming over every single day to see him if he were at our house. But that's it's own problem as well. She is a lot of deal with herself, with a very strong personality. The idea of having no space from her is another reason we don't like this idea. My wife doesn't need the stress of that every single day without somewhere to decompress. Not too mention that means it's our doors that are constantly revolving with nurses in and out", "Make sure you don\u00c4't allow him to be brought to YOUR home - he should go to HIS home.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHelp your parents arrange for professional care.", "Ah no that's not what I meant, sorry if I implied she wouldn't visit him. What I was thinking of was caregiver fatigue, where the constant presence and reliance of the sick individual just crushes the carer over time. It's a totally natural response and the solution is for the carer to take regular short breaks - like going home to their own house at night, as your mom has been doing. It's especially difficult with end of life care for obvious reasons.\n\nI was thinking of hospice at home in your *parents* house, not yours. Then your mom can spend all the time she wants with him but still be able to leave for that break to decompress and know he's in safe hands. \n\nI've been through hospice with four people, two I was very close to and one in my home. It is mentally and physically draining and absolutely not something you take on unless you can devote a lot of energy to. Your energy is going to be all on your wife and new child (congratulations in advance!). Very few people want their Mom or MIL around all the time even in normal circumstances. I would keep your foot firmly down about this but see if you can get mom some help to come round to the idea of in home hospice or even facility hospice care. \n\nHospice and hospital or nursing care are very different, fwiw. Hospice is much more individualised, rooms are decorated and the staff get to know their patients so much better. I'm sure there are bad hospices but the ones I've been in the staff all feel strongly about a caring end of life. I'm so sorry you're in this position.", "There's a lot of excuses in here, from both sides, that don't make any sense. My favorite:   \n\n\n> If he passed here, there's no doubt we'd be packing up and having to sell the house.\n\nWhat?\n\nBut that's really besides the point. If you say no, it is a no. She married him, so she's on the hook to be there for him. It is really sad that this is happening, I am sure this isn't what he would want - loved ones fighting over who doesn't want him the most. It is really tragic.\n\nNTA, but the whole thing just sounds awful.", "NTA. She needs to put him first. He will suffer without professional care. He cannot speak. He cannot swallow medication. He needs people who are trained to handle meds in a feeding tube, patients who can't communicate, bedsore prevention, etc. He's just too sick for civilians. It is time for him to have palliative nursing care in his own home.", "NTA. I've read through the comments and it looks like you've decided hospice care is the right idea. It's going to be awful, but you need to put your foot down and insist he go to hospice. I know your mother feels like it's \"giving up\", but it's not. She will feel much worse in the future if she lets her husband die in pain.", "NTA I did all the hospice for my parents and my aunt. I was single with no kids at the time. It was 9 years total \n\nDo NOT accept Dad into your home. When you can, stay there night at Mom's. You have no way of knowing how long, it what the actual moment of death will be like.\n\nYou deserve to start your family in peace. Taking care of a hospice patient is more complicated than a newborn.  Your mom isn't thinking correctly.\n\nDo not tax your wife and newborn with preparing for death. This is completely understandable and counterintuitive.\n\nGotta tell ya, your dad wouldn't want this fired your new home and impending birth.  Final stage care is a 24/7 nightmare.\n\nYou owe your wife and baby, no one else.\n\nI'm so sorry you. Please be strong.", "Your mom may also be testing the waters for the time when she can\u2019t take care of herself. \n\nAdvice above is all good.  She can get daily help (hospice or otherwise) if he is discharged to her and his home.  She will need that help as lifting him, etc. may be more than she should be doing.  She is not acknowledging the fact that you both work every day so can\u2019t do that for her at her house or yours.  \n\nShe isn\u2019t paying attention to the huge difference an infant in the house will make and how immediate and exhausting an infant\u2019s needs are. Look into getting a live in caregiver.  Do not let him be discharged to your home and do not let him return to his home unless the necessary assistance is in place.  Hospice is definitely an option.  Good luck.", "I agree with the other comments that say that your mother will not end up coming around nearly as much as she claims she will, however\u2026. Who can blame her. \n\nShe\u2019s about to lose the love of her life. Thats must be emotionally excrutiating and exhausting, never mind having to watch him slowly fade away and stop being the man she knew. I dont blame her for not wanting to watch. \n\nYou haven\u2019t mentioned her age here but as you\u2019re having a baby, I\u2019m guessing she\u2019s in her early sixties, minimum.  There\u2019s no way she\u2019s strong enough to lift him if he needs help etc.  The labour required in constantly moving him and tending to his needs must be knackering!! I expect she has serious doubts about being physically able to manage. \n\n\nI recognise of course that losing your father is equally distressing for yourself, and I am not at all trying to deminish your feelings, but whereas you seem to be coping, and have a wonderful baby to look forward to, your mum sounds like she may not be, and she\u2019s about to get left alone which is very daunting.\n\nIs there any chance of a compromise? Keeping Dad at mums but arranging a carer a few hours a day  to take some of the load etc? You moving in with your Mum (i realise this depends on how far along your wifes pregnancy is) for the final weeks so you can face it together as much as possible? \n\nGood luck with whatever you choose. Just try to approach it with as much compassion as possible, and not as an inconvenience.", "NTA you have you immediate to worry about first and it sounds like this would get dumped on you and your wife. Here we have palliative care for end of life. Maybe you have something similar there", "NTA but sounds like she needs a break, maybe have your husband go over there and you take your mother out to eat for a \"break\" while your husband is there. My MIL is my FIL full time caregiver and you can see where she's withered away to nothing almost. She doesn't do anything. I don't want this to happen to your mom.", "If he's in a hospital, they should have someone who's job is to help transition people between hospital/rehab/long term facility/hospice, whatever is needed. You may need to talk to his Drs without your mother present to see what kind of care he needs. Did your father sign an advanced directive (usually referred to as a DNR form)? It helps to know what HE wants.\n\nMy mother was in memory care for her last 2 yrs and in hospice the last month. While the facility she was in had excellent care, the hospice team provided extra support for her and guidance to us. She lived 200 miles away and there was no way for either of us to have moved and in-home care was about 3x the cost of the facility.\n\nI would probably enlist someone else like a medical person or clergy (if so inclined) to help you help her work thru all of this.\n\nLastly, with you and your wife both WFH fulltime and a LO arriving soon, it would probably be better for everyone for your father to be at his home if he's not able to be in care facility. While we want to take care of our spouses/parents, sometimes the help they need is too far outside our capabilities.", "NTA, but i really don't get the whole \"we'd have to sell the house and move if he died here\" thing.  That seems totally bizarre to me, but even leaving that out of the equation, your mom needs him to come to her house and get round the clock hospice care.  Contact the social worker at the hospital where your dad is - that person should be able to give you information how to get this set up.  You are close enough to get over there in a few minutes if your mom needs you.  \n\nGive your mom some grace - she is about to lose her life partner and grief does strange things to people.  Could be she can't face the idea of being alone with him when he passes - that might make sense if your fear of death comes from your upbringing.", "Hospice care isn\u2019t \u201cgiving up\u201d. It just means that at this time, doctors think that dad has six months or less to live. People often wait too long to request hospice because they think it means that death is imminent (like within a week). On the contrary, it\u2019s often that patients do better and have better quality of life as their pain is better controlled and other needs better let when hospice intervenes earlier.", "NTA, and this is such a tough situation. Any chance there are any hospice houses around you? Many hospices will take a patient on a feeding tube.", "NTA - if you are in the US at home hospice is free.  We did this for my grandmother.", "No the issue is that OP and his wife are expecting a child and can't possibly take care of the Dad while he is dying. They don't have the room or the capacity.  Not wanting someone dying in their home is secondary to the fact that they can not manage it. And the Dad needs hospice care to keep him from dying in pain.", "ALL of us have been with him. Mom was with him every single day in the care facility, wife and I visited every day after work. Even coming straight after prenatal appointments, we've always made time to be there. But the reality is the situation has changed and I really don't think our house is the best place, for any of us. He has deteriorated a lot since we first talked him coming here, and now we're pregnant. If something happened to him at night, we don't know the first thing about medical care. He needs a hospice facility, not our home with the added stress of a high risk pregnancy as well", "As I replied elsewhere, I typed this post just after it happened. I was not in a good headspace. Maybe it wouldn't be so drastic a situation as needing to move. But honestly, still not a stress or situation I want for us\n\nIt is definitely not a matter of neither wanting him. We offered him to be with us in the first place, but that was months ago when he was still somewhat independent AND we weren't pregnant. He requires a level of care now that frankly I don't think we can manage. My mother doesn't want to get rid of him either, she has been with him every single day in the care facility and I have no doubt she'd be at our house every single day if he were here.\n\nBut my wife needs to be focusing on her pregnancy, and dad needs hospice care. That's become very clear to me now. It's not a matter of not wanting him, *we can't* anymore. He's fully dependent and needs a fulltime hospice team", "Both of my parents are in their 70s, both were VERY healthy before any of this... you'd never guess they were in their 70s. Mom is still very independent, but ill equipped to be taking care of him in his current state. But so are we now given the circumstances. When we first talked about the possibility of him being moved into our house, he was still semi-independent and we weren't pregnant. That has changed now that he's hooked up to machines and my wife is 4 months.\n\nI don't think either of our homes is appropriate after giving this more thought and seeing comments here. Even in-home hospice is only there during the day, **none** of us are capable if something happened overnight. He needs to be in a 24/7 hospice facility, which is the talk I now need to have with her. I'm just dreading her reaction because she has a negative outlook on hospice", "It definitely comes from her upbringing, she can't even drive past the hospital where her own mother died. I know how hard this is for her, as much as I love my dad SO MUCH, I know it's an entirely different feeling from a spouse perspective.\n\nThe fear of him dying at home was a spur of the moment reaction. The phone call had just happened before I typed this post, and it jumped in my head and took over. The thought of trying to build a home for my child and having my father die in it, moving was an overreaction at the moment but still not something I want when we should be thinking of our new family\n\nI'm taking the rest of the day off right now and going to the hospital to have these conversations with her and the doctors in person", "Your mother, as your father's next of kin, needs to start communicating to healthcare and social services professionals that she can't provide care for him. That she can't lift him or help him transfer. She needs to ask for support caring for him, as well as help from Occupational Therapists for equipment such as hospital beds, hoists etc. You have your own family to take care of. You won't have the time to be able to take care of your father adequately as well.", "NTA. I\u2019m sure he probably wants to pass in his own home. But more importantly realistically you don\u2019t want to move in this economic environment given you might be priced out.  Think of your family and say no to your mom.  My SIL had hospice in her own home when she passed from ALS. If he can\u2019t be moved to hospice care then your mom probably has to take over.  My father had what appeared to be a stroke and I was beside him. I didn\u2019t call anyone else in the house I called 911 as she should do first before alerting you or anyone else.", "OP, ignore this person. End of life care is *incredibly* difficult, even for those who have healthcare training. \n\nIf you haven\u2019t already, reach out to the social worker at the hospital. If you aren\u2019t sure how to contact them, start with any department titled something like \u201cpatient services\u201d. Tell them that your mother\u2019s house, and your house, are not acceptable places for your father at this point, and you need to discuss different options. They\u2019ll work with you (or maybe just your mom if you aren\u2019t authorized to make medical decisions).\n\nIf your mom manages to get him discharged, an ambulance will drive your father to wherever she decides she wants him to go (to a privately-owned residence, they won\u2019t just show up at a hospice facility without talking to the director there first). \n\nIf that\u2019s your house, the ambulance will drive him to you. You do not have to allow them to bring your father into your house. And you *shouldn\u2019t* allow them to. Once he\u2019s in your house, his care is your responsibility. Kindly refuse and say that you did not agree to this and your home is not suitable to safely care for your father. They\u2019ll either bring him back to the hospital, or coordinate with the hospital to have him brought to a suitable facility (procedures vary based on the hospital system). \n\nI\u2019m so sorry that you\u2019re in this position, and I\u2019m sorry that your mom is having to deal with this too.", "Ah. That clarifies matters. She's in denial and leaning on you to either pull out a miracle or burst her bubble and there are no miracles to be had. I'm sorry OP.", "This is going to be a very difficult conversation, but you need to put your foot down about hospice services. I (unfortunately), have a lot of experience with end-of-life care situations: my mother was an elder-care/hospice nurse for 20 years, I helped daily with my grandmother's terminal cancer until she passed, and I cared for both of my parents as they passed quite young from varying Stage 4 cancers-- all this before I hit 30.\n\n*You cannot come through this crisis with your life and sanity intact without Hospice.* \n\nIt sounds like hyperbole, but your mom needs to, at the very least, come to terms with this situation. I know, it's soul-crushing. It's miserable. I didn't have any help with my parents as an only child, and when my dad told me he was going to start hospice about a month before he passed, I was absolutely livid inside of my mind yet accepting outwardly. I didn't want to admit it was the end, but set it up for my dad, regardless.\n\nAnything your dad needs at home, the nurses arrange. Hospital beds, prescriptions, bathroom aids. If you need a break, there are respite days where they can take your dad for a week or two to a facility (the amount of days varies; my grandmother got a 7 day respite). They also provide much faster access to pain meds than usual, and usually left a bottle of morphine for them early on (that may have changed by now, but every relative I've lost got one handed to me from the nurses). I deeply appreciated them fetching Dad's meds, as I couldn't leave him alone to get them myself with everything else going on.\n\nIt's going to be a hard situation: even *with* Hospice, that final month was full of horrible things that my mind mostly won't let me recall. The things I do recall were pure nightmare fuel, but would have been much worse without help. *Your family can't provide the right care for him without hospice workers to assist, and it's not 'giving up' to do so.* It may feel like it, but it's not. I hope your mom and dad get the help and care they need, and I hope the best for your new baby.", "Yeah, that sounds best tbh. Even with the best of intentions, the level of care he requires sounds like a LOT for only a couple of people who aren\u2019t trained for that sort of thing.", "That's fair. Everyone is going through a lot, I'm sure, and emotions are still high. As long as he gets the medical care he needs and the love from everyone, he and everything will work out for the best.\nBest of luck to you and your family. Keep your chin up.", "Awwww. I\u2019m sorry its come to this, but you\u2019re doing the right thing. Taking care of your father is a whole world of pressure!\n\nOf course she does. Hospices are as lovely as they can be, but nothing says \u2018end of life\u2019 like End of Life Care. \n\nI hope he goes peacefully and then you, your family and mum can move on to happier times.", "Why on earth would your mother have a negative outlook on something that exists solely to ensure that people are able to end their days not suffering in terrible pain, not feeling suffocated while struggling to breathe, not alone and terrified, not in chaos, but in peace and comfort, with calm and caring assistance? Surely, she must want your father's final days to be as comfortable and peaceful as possible \u2013 I know that's what we wanted for my father, as he died of metastatic cancer, and hospice gave us precisely that.", "This is an excellent point. With a wife close to giving birth Op can't be at home 24/7 to keep an eye on his father. It simply won't be a safe situation to have him there knowing Op will have to leave the house at very short notice.", "You can't possibly compare washing dishes with caring for a terminally ill man while also being old yourself. \n\nYou really don't understand why someone would have fears about doing the second ? While the idea suggested by OP's mother is not ideal for his family, there is no need to dismiss and doubt the OP mother's fears either.", "It isn't a religion, it's bullshit.", "Because she does not want his days to end, she still wants cancer treatments for him and him to get better. Understandably so, I want that too. But I'm starting to believe that's not realistic, his oncologist has already said no treatment is possible, it's definitely a hospice situation. I just need to have that talk with her", "It's his wife but also his parents. I would say it is worth bringing up the option (to the wife) considering the houses are so close together and his wife works from home. It's a shitty situation. Whatever they do, someone is going to lose something, so it is a compromise (they get to keep the death out of the house, mother gets to not be alone in case something happens). Some pregnancies are not terrible, and he is close enough that he can go back and forth to do the heavy chores for her.", "Adding on to this, depending on where OP is located the end of life care facilities might be called \u201cPalliative Care\u201d rather than \u201cHospice\u201d (there are probably other names for it to just sharing the ones I know in case it\u2019s useful).\n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss", "Abandoning your wife during pregnancy very often makes you wake up divored.
