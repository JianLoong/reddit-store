But now that he's on a feeding tube and fully dependent, they won't accept him any longer (we've learned A LOT about how messed up long term care is through this experience). My mother now wants him to stay in our house rather than hers, while she comes over to care for him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's where things get complicated. My wife is now pregnant with our first child, which obviously adds a lot stress as is.

We fear part of her angle is that we will be his new 24/7 care, which we've heard hints of, i.e. \"you can take breaks in the day to help me\", \"I'll feel better that he's in a house with able bodied adults\".

Ive gone through the same with my father and it was No problem getting help.", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nI'm sorry that you are in this position, especially at what should be a 100% joyful time.

I'd suggest a home care nurse be employed to assist her.\n\nNTA", "Call your local town elderly rights. They can help you get state insurance that covers the bed and shared room. Put him in a nursing home. If he can't take care of himself and you work so wife gets stuck with another kid", "Do you have the means for an end of life care nurse to stay with him and your mom? This is what my family member chose (she wanted to be in her own home) and it would take the stress of care off your mother and let him be in his own space he\u2019s lived in for however long.\n\nNTA", "See if you can get a hospice professional to talk with her. If your father is not receiving medical intervention(chemo) anymore -he should be in hospice. Hospice is set up in his home with health aids/social workers/ other professionals etc coming to stay with him and help her. You can tell her that hospice is not a sentence -if somehow patients get better they get out of hospice care and go back to receiving their regular medical treatment. This is so hard for her\u2026 I know from experience\u2026 and these are such scary words and I am sure she is frightened. I cared for my mother as she was dying and hospice gives so much more support and peace than a hospital. I think you should talk to a hospice person to get fully informed and then you can sit with your mom and the hospice person together so she will have 2 people to explain things to her. Hospice professionals\u2019 whole purpose is to empathetically help people like your mom who are shying from the reality that the person they love is slipping away.", "NTA - Before starting I want to give my condolences to you and your family.\n\nTry compromising with your mom. Maybe go on the weekends to give her some time for herself and make her food some nights? Taking care of a loved one is hard and I can understand her need for support but there\u2019s multiple ways of supporting her through this as well as yourselves.", "Nta", "If there's not another local long term care facility besides that one, you'll need to look into facilities a little further away if hospice is off the table for now. If dad stays with you, he's going to get bedsores and incontinence rashes if he's not checked and repositioned every 2 hours. Turning and lifting a full grown man may be too challenging for your mother at home, but with you and your wife both working there's absolutely not enough time you can give to dad's care unless your mom is willing to move in with you.", "NTA\nI understand both parts, but I agree with you. Your dad can\u2019t stay in your house. \n\nI know is expensive, but have you consider hiring someone to help your mom while your dad is there? E.I. a nurse, nurse student or someone with certain level of knowledge of what to do if anything happens?", "NTA\n\nIt's rich your mother not wanting her husband to die in the house because she'd have to move  but it's okay for you to move when he dies at yours.\n\nWould she be okay if you moved a state or two away in your hunt for a new house.  The other option is to not move.\n\nLook at a residential hospice or palliative care facility.  I'm not sure what care facilities you looked at but they may not have been for what you needed.  Perhaps ask the clinic where the doctor that is treating your dad is.  He could be hospital based.  But they will know who to contact and where help can be gotten.", "He no longer has ability to converse which complicates things. He was always level headed though and I'm sure that's how he would see it also. But my mother is very... fear oriented? Once she has a fear in her mind it's all she focuses on. Her reasoning is like if falls off the bed or needs to move him, shes helpless until we arrive, things like that. I really do feel awful, but it stresses me to no end the more I think about him being here. I'd feel like we're tied to being home, and we have tons of Dr appointments these days, things to prepare for our family, etc...", "Merica. She didn't know about separate \"long term insurance\" before this, which is needed in this case. Their regular medical care does not pay for care facilities or in home care for long term illness", "Man I honestly don't think I could ever walk by that room if my father died in it. My wife couldn't handle it either. The thought stresses us both to no end, we just want our kid to grow up here", "My wife has expressed she would be too uncomfortable to remain here. My mother is also highly religious and won't even SET FOOT in a house where someone has died, so shed never visit her grandchildren if we stayed here", "Still married and very much loves him. Her fear is no 24/7 help immediately available and not being physically capable if there's some emergency, like if he fell off the bed or something.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTheir insurance apparently would not cover a full-time live in caretaker so it would be out of pocket. She can only afford a few hours a day and shes terrified of the rest of the day being along. Even if we were just 5 minutes away. Being in our house would make her more comfortable", "Perhaps talk to you mother about a live in nurse? Also there are services available to assist people like that who are alone so i think if you remove yourelf as an option, your mother will look elsewhere for a solution, being an adult herself, thus is not unreasonable.", "I think this might be a case for hospice care- can you investigate that? People think it\u2019s for someone who has just weeks to live and that it\u2019s grim - that\u2019s not the case though.", "So that's why your mother doesn't want your dying father in his home?\n\nWow.\n\nMay I ask, what religion is this?  I've never come across a religion that is so uncaring about death and dying.\n\n\nAnd just to clarify, in which house is your father now?\n\n\nI am sorry for you, this is a tough situation.  But if your father is not in your house right now, don't let him be moved to you just because your mother is uncomfortable.", "Holy H! \nTrying every angle to make it logical\u2026 hmm can\u2019t find one which isn\u2019t basically explained by your mom is a selfish hypocrite, or irrational by the pain. \n\nNTA", "Your mom and wife sound ridiculous. This happens all the time.", "In that case she's hugely unreasonable and self centred. If he falls in the night you're only 5 minutes away.", "Yea I think your mother is being paranoid, unreasonable and unfair.   Thats a massive burden to put on a person especially knowing this will affect your life for the worse.  With a baby in the house its stressful enough a lot of marriages fail during that period because of all the stress now you are adding another lair.  I don't feel that is right.", "Serious question: Are there no hospices in the US?\n\nIf the care facilities will no longer take him because they can't provide the care he requires, it means his needs have gone up, and the requirements to meet those needs are similarly raised. \n\nMoving from a care facility back home is a step backwards: if Mom couldn't handle looking after him months ago, she can't handle looking after him now.\n\nThat doesn't mean that the answer is that she moves him in with you.  She's being a bit disingenuous/in denial to suggest that it will be fine for him to be with you because she'll be there during the day - when she's not having a break. What happens at night with her plan? Nursing care is 24/7 - the patient doesn't stop needing care because Mum has gone home.\n\nI'm really sorry, OP. You're definitely NTA.", "I think that's really triggering for her because of the \"giving up\" imagery of hospice. Even though his Dr said no more surgery is possible and have not given him any more chemo, like it's very clear there are no more treatments for his condition... She is still in the mindset of him getting better", "Honestly I wouldn't want to walk past the room he died in. It wouldn't be the home we're building for our new family, it would be the house dad died in. I'm sure people move past those things, but I'm struggling thinking about it myself", "I am sorry for your loss, as it is an ongoing loss.  We went through something similar with my mother as she passed from lung cancer.\n\nHospice was amazing.  A caretaker came in regularly to answer questions, check on health needs and just give support overall.  My mother was still aware at first, professionals also volunteered their time for things like massages and reiki treatments.  They also gave support to us as the family.  In addition, they gave us things like hospital beds and wheelchairs.\n\nFinally they helped us know when the end was truly near.  They transported her by ambulance to a local hospital with a hospice wing where she was able to pass peacefully.\n\nYour mother does not get to abdicate responsibility and hold back important supports, you are currently his daily caretaker.  Contact his doctor tomorrow and ask him to help you arrange hospice care.  Your mother also might change her mind when she sees how wonderful they can be.\n\nIf any hospice care workers/volunteers are reading this, I will always be thankful for your work.  You are beautiful people.", "Denying her husband the safety and comfort of the care he needs because of her own feelings is cruel. I'm sorry that you are all going through this but he needs appropriate care. \n\nYou and your family can't care for him the way he needs, she wants him to stay with you because its easier for her not because it's best for him. He cannot advocate for himself right now, its important that those around him make choices in his best interest.", "Sadly she needs to accept the reality of what\u2019s happening. \nI would also suggest hospice as they can provide the proper care needed in these situations including painkillers that would make his passing peaceful. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re in this situation OP.", "It's not \"giving up\" it's allowing and welcoming a peaceful death.  If he's terminally ill, hospice is a kindness."]}
