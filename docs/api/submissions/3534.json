It\u2019s not even the fact he\u2019s used it, it\u2019s just the fact he\u2019s not even bothered to ask me first.

He should be made aware that he's being inconsiderate. \n\nIf him hearing that his behavior is negatively impacting you makes him more upset than the fact that he is actually causing harm, then his priorities in the relationship are way out of whack.", "NTA.  Actually,  you don't trust him; because he can't be trusted to leave your stuff alone!", "NTA but it sounds like you need to have one more sit down with him and explain to him that he is breaking your trust (because if you have to hide stuff then the trust is broken) by continually using your stuff without permission and by doing that even after you have spoken to him multiple times about not doing it.\n\nMake your feelings clear and set clear boundaries. He doesn't get to trample your boundaries just because he is your partner, by doing so he is showing he cares more about his own needs than yours. And if he doesn't respect the small stuff i.e your boundaries with your property, there will come a time he doesn't respect the big stuff either, i.e. you.\n\nIf the behaviour continues after this then kick him to the curb and find someone who respects you and your boundaries.", "Youre Not The asshole, but I do think you\u2019d benefit from dealing with the problem directly. Tell him that it bothers you and that you want him to ask first. If he can\u2019t respect that boundary than it may be time to re evaluate your relationship. But being passive about it helps neither of you", "NTA, you've brought up that it's a problem, he's only \"listening\" for a short time because he thinks he can get away with it - and he is. When he uses a product, he *knows* he didn't buy it, and therefore you did. It's not like he's \"forgetting\" you don't like it, since you raised the issue several times. He doesn't care that it's costing you money and frustration, he's prioritizing his own convenience over that.\n\nThere's a point where there isn't anything *you* \"can do better\". He's being an inconsiderate asshole. I think you should have another conversation with him and make it *very clear* that it is a *big* problem, not just a minor annoyance. He is disrespecting you by *not allowing you to have things for yourself*. And you *should* want him to think you can't trust him, because you can't. You can't trust him to ask you before he uses your things, you can't trust him to leave your things in good condition when he uses them, you can't trust him to genuinely listen and try to make long term changes to his behavior when you raise an issue.", "NTA. You need to address this directly with him and say how you feel he is breaking your trust by using your things. Not being able to trust a partner is a HUGE red flag. If he doesn't care about your boundaries with your belongings he certainly won't care about your boundaries in the future with potentially bigger things. I would have a serious talk with him about how you feel and if it doesn't go well or if the behavior continues, he isn't worth your time.", "NTA Have you talked with him about why he doesn\u2019t replace what he uses, and never asks before using your things? Realize that his behavior won\u2019t change unless you set boundaries. (And maybe not even then.)", "NTA\n\nIt's OK to not want to share some things. \n\nChristmas is coming up, perhaps get him his own supply of an item, or ask him to buy the item for you. The better he understands the cost, hopefully the more respectful he will be about using it.", "NTA and maybe reconsider this relationship. It kinda sounds like he has 0 respect for your things, which in turn means he doesn't respect your time and finances. Everyone is allowed to have their own personal things, especially since your the one paying for them.", "NTA, but it may be more productive to ask him not to use your personal stuff without asking.", "INFO: Have you actually communicated with him about this? Sounds like this is a situation that could be solved by just explaining some of that stuff is expensive or you only have a limited amount so you would prefer if he would ask first.", "NTA but I think he would understand if you actually communicated this to him and set boundary, which I can\u2019t tell from  what you\u2019ve said in this post if you have done or not prior to hiding your things.", "NTA.... BUT....\n\nIf there are things you are willing to share without him asking and things you're not willing to share without permission first, can you come up with a system? Maybe put your name on the items you really don't want him using?\n\nI know it seems silly to have to go this route and honestly he SHOULD ask before using anything of yours, but maybe this level of compromise for the sake of the relationship? \n\n(Source: Had to label my cookie butter as \"do not touch or you will die\" from the ex-husband EVERY single time I bought it and it was easier to just label it than to get mad at him every time he would eat it.

And there\u2019s nothing you can do to change that, because he just doesn\u2019t care enough to take you seriously when you tell him this is a problem, or take how you might feel into consideration before he just takes what he wants.  Is that really the kind of relationship you want to be in?", "NTA\n\n\"is there anything else I can do better?\"\n\nDon't put the onus on you, the victim.  Yes.   Tell your BF to grow the hell up and leave your expensive stuff alone.  Also, a good way to fix his wagon is to make him pay for the expensive stuff.  Immediate repayment **every time**!\n\nHas he repaid you for the \" semi expensive teeth whitening stuff\" that he used?\n\nHas he paid you for the \"special food for myself\" that he used?\n\nHas he paid you for the \"skincare to food or drinks that I buy specifically for myself due to dietary needs\" that he used?\n\nUntil and unless there are consequences, he will continue. Don't hide your things in your own home. You don't have to live that way.  Make him fork up the cash.", "NTA. It isn't your responsibility to change him.

You shouldn't have to hide things from your boyfriend.", "INFO: does he know how much you spend? When you \u201cmentioned\u201d it, did you also talk about consequences? Seems like it doesn\u2019t stick because either way he gets to use nice things. What if he knew he\u2019d have to pay for it? Or reimburse you? What if this was enough to break up over? Would he stop then? \n\nSeems like you have a child and not a partner honestly.", "NTA - I would have another conversation with him and tell him that you feel that you may have to START hiding things from him as you feel like he is taking too much liberty with some of the things you purchase. That way he sees that it is really impacting you without hurting his feelings too much.", "NTA\n\nBut why don't you want him to think you can't trust him. You should want him to know that you can't trust him.

This is basic stuff that we learned in kindergarten. He feels entitled, and he\u2019s using you by using your stuff. And he doesn\u2019t even respect you enough to not destroy your things as he steals them . Consider couples counseling, even if it\u2019s just one appointment to discuss this one matter. Unfortunately sometimes people like this won\u2019t listen to their person they\u2019re taking advantage of. Having an outside party telling him that it\u2019s completely inappropriate might knock some sense into him. You should also consider the fact that he doesn\u2019t respect you enough to follow through when you ask him.

He's not a child, so he shouldn't need repeated reminders. He makes the choice to ignore your requests, and that decision is his to make or not.

His behavior is unacceptable, and he\u2019s an adult. It\u2019s not your job to teach him how to be a better person when we\u2019re talking about basic kindergarten stuff. He needs to step up. He stops listening because he knows he can walk all over you. I\u2019m sorry if that\u2019s harsh, but you\u2019re just letting him treat you like this. He needs consequences. You need to be firm about the consequences. If you say, \u201cif you eat my food you need to pay for it\u201d and then he eats your food and you don\u2019t make him pay for it, then he knows that he can just do whatever he wants regardless of how you feel.

It\u2019s up to you whether you choose to try a different approach to the same ongoing issue, or cut your losses and leave.

What you\u2019re not seeing is that it is majorly wrong. This is an an occasional I had a cookie craving. He consistently uses and destroys your things so much that you\u2019re hiding them. He never listens to you. This is huge. Do you wanna spend the rest of your life hiding your belongings because he just doesn\u2019t wanna care about how you feel?

But you need to talk with him and reach an agreement as to what is yours and what is his and agree on consequences if someone crosses the line without permission.", "NTA then because you did the right thing and communicated the issue.
