She is a bad drunk and breaks shit. I ended it for my own mental well being and to stabilise the household for the kids, which she took poorly, but did my best to continue to support her emotionally (we're in each others lives for better or worse so I'd rather do it as genuine friends at a minimum) etc. and we have been Co-parenting semi-effectively since, and have been kind of 'on and off'. We have worked a lot on communication and have been 'on' in a non-labelled kind of way for the past few months.  \n\n\nI'm going to see a band in a few weeks which has been planned for nearly 8 months. It had been arranged that she would look after the kids that night as i have them 50% of the time. She asked a couple of weeks ago if i could arrange with my parents to look after the kids instead as she wanted to go out with a friend. Sure, no problem.   \n\n\nI get a phone call and she says 'You are away on this weekend, can me and my friend stay at your house when you aren't there'.   \n\n\nI said i wasn't comfortable with that but i'd consider it and we could discuss it later, and she pushed for a reason so I explained that i don't know her friend, it's my home and I'm protective of my space and because of previous experiences with her being a destructive drunk and being disrespectful to my home in the past.  \n\n\nShe cut the call short and then i didn't hear from her until the next evening. She was upset that i hadn't followed up with her 'because i knew that I'd hurt her feelings', and she was upset that I didn't trust her and thought she was disrespectful, it was a problem for our relationship and she was questioning us being 'together' and thought I was being an asshole.  \n\n\nWe spoke and i did my best to articulate my thoughts, and that i didn't think she was a disrespectful person 99% of the time but it was the 1% that made me uncomfortable. Which made things worse.  \n\n\nI don't feel like an asshole but AITA?\n\nEdit :- My house is closer to the city which is why she wants to stay here. \n\nI have let her be in my home without me in the past but only when she's been looking after the kids, never for a social/drinking thing or with people I don't know.\n\n\nEdit 2: Her friend is female, and is just a friend. \n\nEdit 3: as some people are hooked on this bit - The kids are fine. Happy, healthy and very loved.

Once other people are involved it gets messy.  When those other people are your kids, it is really messy.  You need to figure your relationship with baby mama out.  Either end it and both of you co-parent without being together or get couples counseling and work to keep it together.
