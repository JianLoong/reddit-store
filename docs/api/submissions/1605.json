She's fantastic and our relationship has been so good for the both of us. Planning the wedding has been uncomplicated and fun. We included my mother a lot, for example, my fiancee took her dress shopping. \n\nThe reason is, that my fiancee has always had a good relationship with my parents, and it grew much closer over the past year, after her mother died. They kind of see her as another child and I know that fiancee appreciates that immensely. As for my fiancee's father, she went NC when she was 15, even before he hadn't played an important role in her life. His behavior was one cause in her having depression and low self-esteem, it took her years to heal. She's happy with the way things are now, I never met the man, so neither of us considered inviting him to the wedding. \n\nMy mother however won't understand why we won't invite him. Mum is a retired psychologist. She's had some experience with children-parent reunification and she thinks my financee needs that, even more after fiancee's mom's death. Fiancee and me both have shut my mum down plenty of times. We both made it clear, that this man was not to know anything about my financees life nor would be welcome anywhere near the wedding. For a while, my mum shut up. My mum doesn't know fiancee's father. \n\nThe other night we had dinner with my family. My mum had an announcement. Apparently she looked my fiancees father up and went to see him. Then she invited him to our wedding. She seemed so pleased. My family was appalled and angry, they all know what has happened. My fiancee somehow remained calm and told mum how inappropriate that was, how mum hurt my financee terribly by stepping over the one boundary she ever had. How fiancee had lost all her trust in mum after this. I then uninvited my mom and we left. Fiancee only broke down at home. \n\nMy mother's also been inconsolable since and called me dozens of times, but I haven't picked up yet. Fiancee feels unsafe to have the wedding if there was a chance that her father might show up. We might just cancel the whole thing. My father, who's not condoning any of my mother's actions, thinks I should talk to mum, hear her out. My siblings agree that uninviting her was too drastic. I just see the distress my mother had caused my fiancee and get angry all over again. So AITA/AWTA for sticking to our decision?\n\nEdit: this is a throwaway account obviously", "created_utc": 1667732298, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ynn0jd/aita_for_uninviting_my_mother_to_my_wedding_after/", "score": 537, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It wasn't just a small mistake or an oversight. It was a deliberate action to trample boundaries and to push an agenda you had made very clear you and your fiancee had no desire to pursue. \nAs a retired psychologist, your mother should have known better then anyone just how damaging the actions she chose would be to your financee, and to any existing relationship between the both of you and herself.", "NTA \n\nShe may be a retired psychologist but she showed the emotional intelligence of soggy bread.\n\nWhat a huge violation of your fianc\u00e9\u2019s boundaries.", "I wonder what people expect from stunts like this? And even if your mom is a psychologist, is she your fiances psychologist? What kind if psychologist would do this to a patient? So honestly, NTA, maybe heear her out, I would with my mom, but I'd stick to the uninvitation if she thinks she can rack havoc KNOWINGLY. And tell her that she can be glad to just be uninvited from your wedding and not your whole life. Horrible behavior right there", "NTA\n\nIf your wife feels unsafe around your mom, then you would not be the AH if you kept your mom from the wedding. Your mom refused to listen and believe everyone telling her to mind her business because she thought she knew better. Well, she f\\*cked around and found out, only it was your fiancee who was hurt the most. Trust is hard to mend once broken. \n\nIf you keep the wedding date, it's important is to make sure the dad doesn't show. Make your mom (with your dad for insurance) go back and tell him he isn't welcome. That if he shows up anywhere near the wedding then the authorities will be called. Assign people at the wedding to keep watch for him and make sure he leaves. \n\nIt would be a shame to call off the wedding, but if neither of you would enjoy it because she'd be so on edge about her dad knowing and showing up, then what's the point?", "NTA.\n\nYour fiance set a very clear boundary with very good reason, and your mother trampled right over it. She does not get to decide that for her DIL.\n\nIf she has experience with reuniting then she should *know* it is often a difficult and painful thing at first - aka absolutely not something you would want to do at your wedding! And not something you should blindsided either party with! \n\nI would talk to her, if only to say you are seriously considering cancelling the wedding because of how unsafe she has made your fiance feel. She needs to know just how serious a breach of trust this was. But further contact or reconciliation should be at your fiance's pace.", "NTA. *Your mother should have known better*.\n\nYes, large events *can* be the start of reconciliation. But if one party is reluctant or negative about the reconciliation then it is widely accepted that there is more chance of failure than success, especially if the person hosting (your fiance) the event is the negative party. It's really obvious, but if things go poorly and the other party (FIL) somehow mars the event, even in the slightest way that nobody notices, it will *dramatically* increase the tension. \n\nThere's a reason psychologists, like medical doctors, are not supposed to treat family. If she's any good at her job she's probably warned hundreds of people away from family that boundary stomp the way she has. At best, she's a hypocrite, at worst, she's delusional.", "NTA your mother was wildly, monstrously out of line. Thank god she\u2019s retired; at least her sphere of damage is limited to her own family now. I\u2019d hate to think of her having a wider influence.", "NTA\n\nShe doesn\u2019t *have to understand* because she doesn\u2019t *want* to understand. I\u2019d consider eloping if it\u2019s possible. What a god damned asshole.\n\nETA: it\u2019s our engagement anniversary today. We haven\u2019t heard from my husbands family in 2 years. We don\u2019t plan to change that.", "NTA.  Your fiancee had ONE SINGULAR boundary and your mother couldn't respect that.  All trust has now been broken and that's not something you can take back.", "NTA. They say weddings and funerals bring out the worst in people for a reason. While I think your mom had good intentions, she absolutely should have respected your boundaries. This is your wedding. This is your and your fiancee's decision, not your mother's. I think it's worth having a talk with her, but I don't know if you will get through to her. She seems to think her way is the only way and disregards other people's feelings and opinions on the matter. But, maybe you can get her to understand. It's worth a try, but I wouldn't be comfortable with her at the wedding either.", "NTA  your mother clearly is though for not respecting your fiancees wishes and meddling. Can you change venues or hire security instead of cancelling the wedding?", "NTA. If you wanna stil with the same wedding, contrat security, that way youre gonna be sure nobody in your guest lista its gonna sowup. If you and your fiance agreed, Talk to your mother, tell her she as no scuse, you understand she was good intention, but she broke your trusth and bondaries in a Big way. \nIts your choice if you wanna have a person in your Life or in your wedding, nobody else.", "NTA\n\nWhat makes people think weddings are time for reconciliations between estranged family memebers?   To just have this guy show up at a wedding where the bride has maybe 3 minutes to speak to each guest does not repair years of damaged relations.  \n\nAs a psychologist, Mom should know that fiance and dad may have many things to discuss that are best tackled 1:1, not in front of 100+ wedding guests.  \n\nOn top of this, seeing her dad may cause distress for the the bride.  Why ruin the wedding day for the bride by springing a guest who brings up bad thoughts and memories.\n\nMom should have her license revoked if this is her method!", "NTA. Your mother was waaaaay out of line and it wasn't her place to use your wedding as a platform for whatever family reunion project she wanted to try. She should know better. I'm not surprised your fiancee feels unsafe and I don't think uninviting your mother was an over-reaction at all - she took it upon herself to meddle in the guest list and doesn't like the consequences? Boo hoo.\n\nIf I were in your position I would absolutely cancel the wedding and rearrange for a different date and venue and not share this information with your mother. No-one can turn up uninvited if there is nothing to turn up to. \n\nSince he has the details now, there is nothing preventing him turning up even if he is formally uninvited, so really the safest option is to move the event - venue, date etc. \n\nYou state that your father and siblings don't condone her behaviour but are still pushing you to hear her out? Sounds like they are tacitly complicit though - if they were really on your side they wouldn't be pushing you to hear her out (which is basically code for let her beat you over the head with her opinion until you agree she is right and go along with her plan). There is nothing for you to 'hear out' - you've already made your decision. The only thing she can do at this point is to uninvite your fianc\u00e9es father and work at trying to rebuild the trust she broke. But I'd place good money on her not being willing to even try doing the former. \n\nYou set your boundaries, your mother violated them. End of story. She hurt your fiancee and betrayed her trust. There needs to be consequences. Additionally, by getting in touch with your fianc\u00e9es father she has opened a communication channel he can use. This needs to be unequivocally closed and it sounds like your mother is unlikely to do that because she somehow feels like she knows best (the arrogance of so-called 'professionals') so until she can prove that channel is closed she can't be trusted.\n\nIt was a shitty thing for your mother to do. You're NTA at all.", "NTA but your mother is giant egoistic AH. Fck psychologists that think they know everything best. The dad was out of her life for a reason, your fianc\u00e9e is an adult and can decide when and IF she will let her dad back into it. Your mom has absolutely NO RIGHT to force it like that. Her behaviour is disgusting. If she forces things like that on your wedding then she can just go drink a coffee with FIL on the wedding day.\n\nI don't think you were harsh and you should stick by your decision. Your mother fcked up big time, especially when you both repeatedly told her, that you don't want him in your life. Such a huge break of trust.\nI just hope she didn't give FIL too much information or your fianc\u00e9e might soon have an absent father bothering her too.", "NTA. Your mom is a psychologist. She knows better than to cross your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s one boundary. I can\u2019t even think why your mother thought this was a good idea. Maybe she got caught up in the romance of your impending wedding, but even so, it was a huge breach of trust.", "NTA\n\nMother crossed a line. A massive, obvious, clearly stated line. I don\u2019t care if she was a psychologist, she has the emotional intelligence of a plank of wood. If it\u2019s doable, cancel everything and run away and get married by yourselves. You\u2019ll have a lovely, stress free wedding.", "NTA\n\nThis was absolutely unacceptable. Your mother can never undo this. She went behind your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s back to the one person she doesn\u2019t want in her life. She can never earn back this trust. \n\nI\u2019m appalled that a retired psychologist would trample all over a clear boundary like this. A clear boundary held by someone she claims to care for. Let alone think that an event like a wedding is the way to do it. Just bang, here\u2019s everyone we know and love in one place on what\u2019s meant to be the happiest day of our lives, come on in!\n\nThere\u2019s nothing to \u2018hear out\u2019. There is no possible excuse or justification. The only slightly good thing she did was tell you in advance. At least he didn\u2019t just show up on the day. The thinnest silver lining possible on a very big cloud.\n\nHowever, you need to talk to your mother if only to find out what else she might have told FIL about your fianc\u00e9e and your lives. Make it clear you need to know everything he might now know.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry. I hope you can have the wedding but also totally understand if your fianc\u00e9e simply doesn\u2019t feel safe proceeding.", "I have gone NC with one parent and if someone did that to me I would be livid and devastated. \n\nYou stood up for your partners wishes on a special day for both of you and that's commendable.\n\nI just wonder if it would have been even better to take your partner out of this situation, comfort her and when she is calm talk about how she would have wanted to deal with this before deciding. Either way NTA \n\nI'm so sorry for your fianc\u00e9e and you, that the day is already so influenced by this she is considering cancelling. I hope you will fine a way through this that will make your relationship stronger", "Nta, this was a massive breach of trust.", "NTA You say your mom is a medically trained psychologist and thinks that forcing a reunion at a wedding is ok? She is the one who needs to seek out some professional help. Forcing her to meet her abuser is cruel and unethical. Where\u2019s the \u201cfirst do no harm\u201d? The only reason you need to talk to your mom is to get your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s fathers number to tell him not to come. Other than that there isn\u2019t anything to talk to her about. Invitation is revoked. She lost the privilege to attend. It\u2019s not your moms day it\u2019s you and your bride.", "Nta and this is why I purposefully chose a younger therapist to help me. Older ones are least likely to have new psychological field knowledge. Literally same theory goes for any doctor.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou were right to uninvite her. Refuse to discuss it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd maybe elope? Because dad and siblings WILL tell mom where the wedding is, so SHE will crash your wedding. And SHE is an AH, and will bring FIL and force him on you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo you need to change the wedding anyway (mom and FIL KNOW where it is, so they WILL show up. And changing it while dad and the siblings are still invited will make it just the same, because you can not trust dad and siblings not to tell her - they have shown they are not on your side in this. - SO have your wedding without them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd: GO NO CONTACT with your abusive mom - protect your fiancee.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My fiancee said, that her family was already torn apart by her father's actions, there shouldn't be a second one. We both hope to find a good way forward. As a first step, I'm meeting my father later tonight, we will see how it goes.", "Im afraid I dont entirely agree. If it were the OP that the mother had done this to, then maybe. But it was OPs fiancee. That is going to make it far more difficult to forgive, I imagine.\n\nSome things arent so easily forgiven. And I dont see any way of inviting the mother that will stop the OPs fiancee feeling betrayed, violated and exposed every time she sees her.\n\nWorse, there is a limit to the extent this can be put right. Telling the father not to come is problematic - it is going to be on the fiancees mind regardless. No amount of security will fix that. And the mother has proved beyond all doubt that she absolutely can not be trusted and is a dangerous liability. I would argue that even letting the mother know the details of any such wedding would be a completely unacceptable risk.\n\nI dont meant to sound harsh - I totally get where you are coming from, its just that I went NC with my own mother over a situation not entirely dissimilar to this one.\n\nI agree that an effort should be made with the mother, but I think we are talking long term. Way beyond any wedding.", "Everyone is not good at their job. I\u2019m guessing OPs mom was not a great psychologist.", "NTA, OP.  And maybe suggest mom go to some counseling to figure out what she did that was so wrong.  Fast forward about four or five years and you find out that Mom decided to take your child to go visit the the FIL because 'he has a right to know his grandchild.'   \n\nThis behavior has to be stopped by her acknowledging/realizing that what she has done is soooo wrong.", "Your mom found fianc\u00e9 dad so mom should be the to contact him and withdraw the invite to the wedding. Let her explain the issues she has caused.  How did she think this was going to play out at the wedding? Would dad walk her down the aisle? Would they sit for the entire reception and get reacquainted? It\u2019s ludicrous really.", "I would hire professional security people, not just ask some of the guests to keep an eye out. You want him stopped before he gets in the door and removed quietly so that your fiance never notices.", "No matter how much security you have, I strongly suspect that your fiancee will be super-anxious all day in fear of him turning up. I would be, in a similar situation.\n\nStill, good for you for having fiancees back to this extent. I hope you can work something out whereby she doesnt feel nervy / unsafe at her own wedding.", "If you still go through with things, part of your mother's reconciliation needs to be paying for extra security to ensure your FIL doesn't even approach the venue. Make sure you're the one who actually books them so she can't sabotage things, but she essentially needs to write you a blank check to make sure it's covered since it's fixing her mistake.\n\nNTA", "If you decide to talk to her - make conditions: 1. She dis-invites your fiance's father before you will even consider it 2. She is willing to pay for any additional cost associated w/ security and/or relocation/canceling/date change for the wedding. 3. She stays away from your fiancee, no calls, no texts, nothing until your fiancee is ready. This may still include not being at the wedding but will definitely include not being any part of the wedding. 4. Any further intevention/pressure any member of your family/family friends puts on you or your fiancee re: inviting fiance's father or reconciling w/ mother/allowing mother at the wedding will stop any and all conversation you are having with her in their tracks.  5. She does not try to justify her actions. You will only listen to her admit she was 100% wrong, accept full responsibility, and what she plans on doing to make amends, including not making a stink if she can't attend the wedding b/c you and your fiancee aren't ready to forgive her yet. You will not put up w/ any manipulation from her or on her behalf by someone else. She needs to admit she wasn't doing what was best for your fiancee, she was doing what she wanted b/c she was selfishly thinking she was right and wanted to prove it by forcing everyone to do what she wanted. She broke every rule of consent out of selfishness and hubris. Either she admits it or there is absolutely no forgiveness.", "Ask your mom why she would invite your fiancee's ABUSER to your wedding and why would she, a trained psychologist, allow her ABUSER anywhere near his victim. Put stress on the word abuser. Because that's what he is. NTA.", "This is exactly why your reaction was not too extreme. She did a horrible thing and needs a serious wake-up call. Her expecting you and your fianc\u00e9e to be grateful is insane.", "OP, please provide an update when you can. \n\nIt's completely appalling to me that she overstepped this way.", "As an estranged daughter myself, I was severely emotionally and verbally abused by my mother and my father couldn't give a damb.  I was sexually abused by my brother, told my mother who said she didn't give a damb.

Go back to FIL and tell him it was her mistake and he is not invited to the wedding. \n\n2. Pay for security at the wedding. \n\n3. Go to therapy to figure out why she felt so compelled to trample over her DIL's boundaries, especially one that has triggered massive anxiety. Your mom is a psychogist and should understand the gravity of her actions. She setback your wife's therapy. \n\nIf she refuses any of this, go NC with her.", "Yes, I think she had visions of swanning around the wedding accepting congratulations in personally being responsible for reuniting them.", "Has he promised you that your mother will not also be meeting with you tonight? He might think it's right to bring her along so you two have a chance to talk. He said he wanted you to \"hear her out,\" which likely means that he wants you to listen to her rationalization and justification and excuses.", "Please update us", "Yeah, I'm a child psychologist and I would NEVER do anything like that.

We haven't thought about that. I'm meeting my father later tonight and will keep it in mind, thank you.", "Consider taking her off to a tropical beach and getting married there, privately. Then after returning you can send out announcements of the marriage and have a nice reception-type party a couple months later at Bil's place.", "Could not have summarized it better, thank you. I'm meeting my father later and will bring this list with me.", "Completely agree, especially about her bearing the cost of security to throw dad out if he shows up.", "If it's an extra cost, tell your mom to stump up the cash since she's the reason you need it.", "Oh yes, 100%", "As the wife of a man whose father was a doctor and mother a nurse, you would be 100% right.\n\nAnd then when the issues came out, MIL played the most dramatic martyr.\n\nBless her heart, she just could not understand why I would not follow her medical advice.....", "Oh, I made him promise. He understands that it's best to talk between the two of us first", "If there is anything to update, I will.", "She is extra extra awesome. She's always this reflected, maybe due to all the therapy she did. I'm sorry that you can relate to her experience, nobody should be able to.", "Psychologists are like doctors. \n\n1/ All of their education won't erase their biais and in fact, probably reinforced some of them/created new ones.  \n\n2/ Many a health practitioner's ability to be objective goes out the window when it comes to family and they become cartoonishly bad at their job.", "Mom either has some very strong narcissistic traits ***or*** she sees your fiancee as a child who doesn't really know what she wants.  Then, her child psych training kicks in and she pulls this stunt.  \n\nI don't know what scenario she falls into, but the change has to come from within her.  If you two have a baby, her playing a central role in getting the 'family' back together is gonna bubble to the surface. \n\n(I'm not a shrink - just lived some trauma filled and boundary stomping years w/ a narcissist.)", "You are of course NTA. Someone who does hurtful things like that loses the right to participate in joyful moments until the hurt parties decide they\u2019re ready to reconcile. \n\nInstead of canceling the wedding, would hiring bouncers be an option?

Good luck navigating this situation, and good work standing by your partner.\n\nNTA obviously", "I would cancel the wedding and elope to a luxury destination without the family. Spend the money on your wife instead. She will be on edge the entire wedding at the original venue anyway and will not enjoy it. \n\nAnd it gives you the opportunity to put your mother in a lengthy time out, which she deserves. \n\nYou can always have a big celebration at one of your anniversaries in the future once the waves have calmed.", "Give it some time before making decisions as right now emotions are high. I'd consider carefully what you both want, is it a wedding? If its a cause of so much stress for her after this why not elope and have a party further down the line?", "Depending on the layout of your venue, the security might be able to kick him out without your fianc\u00e9e ever knowing.

I waited far too long to make the decision she did, and I, too, was better off afterward. If cancelling or rescheduling the wedding allows you both to enjoy the day without fear and anxiety, it might be for the best, although I know what an expensive mess that can be (unfortunately, also an area in which I have personal experience). I hope your mother has the integrity and strength of character to sincerely seek forgiveness from both of you and try to make amends. \n\nYou both sound like lovely people and I sincerely wish you the best.", "I completely agree.
