{"id": 1605, "submission_id": "ynn0jd", "title": "AITA for uninviting my mother to my wedding after she invited FIL?", "selftext": "My financee (29f) and me (34m) are getting married in two weeks after 13 years of friendship and four years of dating. She's fantastic and our relationship has been so good for the both of us. Planning the wedding has been uncomplicated and fun. We included my mother a lot, for example, my fiancee took her dress shopping. \n\nThe reason is, that my fiancee has always had a good relationship with my parents, and it grew much closer over the past year, after her mother died. They kind of see her as another child and I know that fiancee appreciates that immensely. As for my fiancee's father, she went NC when she was 15, even before he hadn't played an important role in her life. His behavior was one cause in her having depression and low self-esteem, it took her years to heal. She's happy with the way things are now, I never met the man, so neither of us considered inviting him to the wedding. \n\nMy mother however won't understand why we won't invite him. Mum is a retired psychologist. She's had some experience with children-parent reunification and she thinks my financee needs that, even more after fiancee's mom's death. Fiancee and me both have shut my mum down plenty of times. We both made it clear, that this man was not to know anything about my financees life nor would be welcome anywhere near the wedding. For a while, my mum shut up. My mum doesn't know fiancee's father. \n\nThe other night we had dinner with my family. My mum had an announcement. Apparently she looked my fiancees father up and went to see him. Then she invited him to our wedding. She seemed so pleased. My family was appalled and angry, they all know what has happened. My fiancee somehow remained calm and told mum how inappropriate that was, how mum hurt my financee terribly by stepping over the one boundary she ever had. How fiancee had lost all her trust in mum after this. I then uninvited my mom and we left. Fiancee only broke down at home. \n\nMy mother's also been inconsolable since and called me dozens of times, but I haven't picked up yet. Fiancee feels unsafe to have the wedding if there was a chance that her father might show up. We might just cancel the whole thing. My father, who's not condoning any of my mother's actions, thinks I should talk to mum, hear her out. My siblings agree that uninviting her was too drastic. I just see the distress my mother had caused my fiancee and get angry all over again. So AITA/AWTA for sticking to our decision?\n\nEdit: this is a throwaway account obviously\n\nEdit 2: this really blew up, didn't it. Thank you all for your advice and perspective. It's truly heartbreaking how many of you have estranged relatives and can relate to this. I'm sorry! \n\nI met my dad earlier. He's really sorry for what my mom did and how he'd pushed me to listen to her at first. I told him that my fiancee was the person hurt in this, that it was really up to her. Dad did offer to cover additional costs we might have now. Both siblings called individually to apologize to fiancee as well. Idk what to make of it just now, it's a good start I think. Haven't talked to mum though. \n\nAlso, my fiancee's bil had a good idea regarding the wedding, we might do it earlier. That way we'd at least keep the venue. We're still figuring details out, but it might actually work.", "created_utc": 1667732298, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ynn0jd/aita_for_uninviting_my_mother_to_my_wedding_after/", "score": 2488, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It wasn't just a small mistake or an oversight. It was a deliberate action to trample boundaries and to push an agenda you had made very clear you and your fiancee had no desire to pursue. \nAs a retired psychologist, your mother should have known better then anyone just how damaging the actions she chose would be to your financee, and to any existing relationship between the both of you and herself.", "NTA \n\nShe may be a retired psychologist but she showed the emotional intelligence of soggy bread.\n\nWhat a huge violation of your fianc\u00e9\u2019s boundaries.", "I wonder what people expect from stunts like this? And even if your mom is a psychologist, is she your fiances psychologist? What kind if psychologist would do this to a patient? So honestly, NTA, maybe heear her out, I would with my mom, but I'd stick to the uninvitation if she thinks she can rack havoc KNOWINGLY. And tell her that she can be glad to just be uninvited from your wedding and not your whole life. Horrible behavior right there", "NTA\n\nIf your wife feels unsafe around your mom, then you would not be the AH if you kept your mom from the wedding. Your mom refused to listen and believe everyone telling her to mind her business because she thought she knew better. Well, she f\\*cked around and found out, only it was your fiancee who was hurt the most. Trust is hard to mend once broken. \n\nIf you keep the wedding date, it's important is to make sure the dad doesn't show. Make your mom (with your dad for insurance) go back and tell him he isn't welcome. That if he shows up anywhere near the wedding then the authorities will be called. Assign people at the wedding to keep watch for him and make sure he leaves. \n\nIt would be a shame to call off the wedding, but if neither of you would enjoy it because she'd be so on edge about her dad knowing and showing up, then what's the point?", "NTA.\n\nYour fiance set a very clear boundary with very good reason, and your mother trampled right over it. She does not get to decide that for her DIL.\n\nIf she has experience with reuniting then she should *know* it is often a difficult and painful thing at first - aka absolutely not something you would want to do at your wedding! And not something you should blindsided either party with! \n\nI would talk to her, if only to say you are seriously considering cancelling the wedding because of how unsafe she has made your fiance feel. She needs to know just how serious a breach of trust this was. But further contact or reconciliation should be at your fiance's pace.", "NTA. *Your mother should have known better*.\n\nYes, large events *can* be the start of reconciliation. But if one party is reluctant or negative about the reconciliation then it is widely accepted that there is more chance of failure than success, especially if the person hosting (your fiance) the event is the negative party. It's really obvious, but if things go poorly and the other party (FIL) somehow mars the event, even in the slightest way that nobody notices, it will *dramatically* increase the tension. \n\nThere's a reason psychologists, like medical doctors, are not supposed to treat family. If she's any good at her job she's probably warned hundreds of people away from family that boundary stomp the way she has. At best, she's a hypocrite, at worst, she's delusional.", "NTA your mother was wildly, monstrously out of line. Thank god she\u2019s retired; at least her sphere of damage is limited to her own family now. I\u2019d hate to think of her having a wider influence.", "NTA\n\nShe doesn\u2019t *have to understand* because she doesn\u2019t *want* to understand. I\u2019d consider eloping if it\u2019s possible. What a god damned asshole.\n\nETA: it\u2019s our engagement anniversary today. We haven\u2019t heard from my husbands family in 2 years. We don\u2019t plan to change that.", "NTA.  Your fiancee had ONE SINGULAR boundary and your mother couldn't respect that.  All trust has now been broken and that's not something you can take back.", "NTA. They say weddings and funerals bring out the worst in people for a reason. While I think your mom had good intentions, she absolutely should have respected your boundaries. This is your wedding. This is your and your fiancee's decision, not your mother's. I think it's worth having a talk with her, but I don't know if you will get through to her. She seems to think her way is the only way and disregards other people's feelings and opinions on the matter. But, maybe you can get her to understand. It's worth a try, but I wouldn't be comfortable with her at the wedding either.", "NTA  your mother clearly is though for not respecting your fiancees wishes and meddling. Can you change venues or hire security instead of cancelling the wedding?", "NTA. If you wanna stil with the same wedding, contrat security, that way youre gonna be sure nobody in your guest lista its gonna sowup. If you and your fiance agreed, Talk to your mother, tell her she as no scuse, you understand she was good intention, but she broke your trusth and bondaries in a Big way. \nIts your choice if you wanna have a person in your Life or in your wedding, nobody else.", "NTA\n\nWhat makes people think weddings are time for reconciliations between estranged family memebers?   To just have this guy show up at a wedding where the bride has maybe 3 minutes to speak to each guest does not repair years of damaged relations.  \n\nAs a psychologist, Mom should know that fiance and dad may have many things to discuss that are best tackled 1:1, not in front of 100+ wedding guests.  \n\nOn top of this, seeing her dad may cause distress for the the bride.  Why ruin the wedding day for the bride by springing a guest who brings up bad thoughts and memories.\n\nMom should have her license revoked if this is her method!", "NTA. Your mother was waaaaay out of line and it wasn't her place to use your wedding as a platform for whatever family reunion project she wanted to try. She should know better. I'm not surprised your fiancee feels unsafe and I don't think uninviting your mother was an over-reaction at all - she took it upon herself to meddle in the guest list and doesn't like the consequences? Boo hoo.\n\nIf I were in your position I would absolutely cancel the wedding and rearrange for a different date and venue and not share this information with your mother. No-one can turn up uninvited if there is nothing to turn up to. \n\nSince he has the details now, there is nothing preventing him turning up even if he is formally uninvited, so really the safest option is to move the event - venue, date etc. \n\nYou state that your father and siblings don't condone her behaviour but are still pushing you to hear her out? Sounds like they are tacitly complicit though - if they were really on your side they wouldn't be pushing you to hear her out (which is basically code for let her beat you over the head with her opinion until you agree she is right and go along with her plan). There is nothing for you to 'hear out' - you've already made your decision. The only thing she can do at this point is to uninvite your fianc\u00e9es father and work at trying to rebuild the trust she broke. But I'd place good money on her not being willing to even try doing the former. \n\nYou set your boundaries, your mother violated them. End of story. She hurt your fiancee and betrayed her trust. There needs to be consequences. Additionally, by getting in touch with your fianc\u00e9es father she has opened a communication channel he can use. This needs to be unequivocally closed and it sounds like your mother is unlikely to do that because she somehow feels like she knows best (the arrogance of so-called 'professionals') so until she can prove that channel is closed she can't be trusted.\n\nIt was a shitty thing for your mother to do. You're NTA at all.", "NTA but your mother is giant egoistic AH. Fck psychologists that think they know everything best. The dad was out of her life for a reason, your fianc\u00e9e is an adult and can decide when and IF she will let her dad back into it. Your mom has absolutely NO RIGHT to force it like that. Her behaviour is disgusting. If she forces things like that on your wedding then she can just go drink a coffee with FIL on the wedding day.\n\nI don't think you were harsh and you should stick by your decision. Your mother fcked up big time, especially when you both repeatedly told her, that you don't want him in your life. Such a huge break of trust.\nI just hope she didn't give FIL too much information or your fianc\u00e9e might soon have an absent father bothering her too.", "NTA. Your mom is a psychologist. She knows better than to cross your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s one boundary. I can\u2019t even think why your mother thought this was a good idea. Maybe she got caught up in the romance of your impending wedding, but even so, it was a huge breach of trust.", "NTA\n\nMother crossed a line. A massive, obvious, clearly stated line. I don\u2019t care if she was a psychologist, she has the emotional intelligence of a plank of wood. If it\u2019s doable, cancel everything and run away and get married by yourselves. You\u2019ll have a lovely, stress free wedding.", "NTA\n\nThis was absolutely unacceptable. Your mother can never undo this. She went behind your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s back to the one person she doesn\u2019t want in her life. She can never earn back this trust. \n\nI\u2019m appalled that a retired psychologist would trample all over a clear boundary like this. A clear boundary held by someone she claims to care for. Let alone think that an event like a wedding is the way to do it. Just bang, here\u2019s everyone we know and love in one place on what\u2019s meant to be the happiest day of our lives, come on in!\n\nThere\u2019s nothing to \u2018hear out\u2019. There is no possible excuse or justification. The only slightly good thing she did was tell you in advance. At least he didn\u2019t just show up on the day. The thinnest silver lining possible on a very big cloud.\n\nHowever, you need to talk to your mother if only to find out what else she might have told FIL about your fianc\u00e9e and your lives. Make it clear you need to know everything he might now know.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry. I hope you can have the wedding but also totally understand if your fianc\u00e9e simply doesn\u2019t feel safe proceeding.", "I have gone NC with one parent and if someone did that to me I would be livid and devastated. \n\nYou stood up for your partners wishes on a special day for both of you and that's commendable.\n\nI just wonder if it would have been even better to take your partner out of this situation, comfort her and when she is calm talk about how she would have wanted to deal with this before deciding. Either way NTA \n\nI'm so sorry for your fianc\u00e9e and you, that the day is already so influenced by this she is considering cancelling. I hope you will fine a way through this that will make your relationship stronger", "Nta, this was a massive breach of trust.", "NTA You say your mom is a medically trained psychologist and thinks that forcing a reunion at a wedding is ok? She is the one who needs to seek out some professional help. Forcing her to meet her abuser is cruel and unethical. Where\u2019s the \u201cfirst do no harm\u201d? The only reason you need to talk to your mom is to get your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s fathers number to tell him not to come. Other than that there isn\u2019t anything to talk to her about. Invitation is revoked. She lost the privilege to attend. It\u2019s not your moms day it\u2019s you and your bride.", "Nta and this is why I purposefully chose a younger therapist to help me. Older ones are least likely to have new psychological field knowledge. Literally same theory goes for any doctor.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou were right to uninvite her. Refuse to discuss it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd maybe elope? Because dad and siblings WILL tell mom where the wedding is, so SHE will crash your wedding. And SHE is an AH, and will bring FIL and force him on you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo you need to change the wedding anyway (mom and FIL KNOW where it is, so they WILL show up. And changing it while dad and the siblings are still invited will make it just the same, because you can not trust dad and siblings not to tell her - they have shown they are not on your side in this. - SO have your wedding without them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd: GO NO CONTACT with your abusive mom - protect your fiancee.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
