She invited my mom to come stay with her over Christmas, and suggested 6 weeks from early December to mid January when flights were cheapest (before and after Christmas rush).\n\nShe also invited me to come and stay, however I work full time and was unsure when exactly I could come, but I knew had to leave the first week of January. Before booking flights, she said she wanted to organise some new years plans with her friends and asked if I would be happy to entertain our mom whilst she did that (because she did not want us at her new years plans). I agreed and to not get bored, I booked a 3 night guided trip from the 30th to 2nd Jan for me and my mom (the 30th is day after my sister told me she would be leaving with her friends).\n\nI ended up booking my flights very late (well after my mom had arrived and after I booked our guided trip) due to work and booked to come for 13 days. I asked my sister when she would be returning from her plans as I would fly home that day so my mom would not be alone. She told me her trip was 6-7 nights, which I found strange as I thought \u2018new years plans\u2019 would be 2-3 days max.\n\nFast forward to me arriving, I ask my sister if she has confirmed her return flight from her new years plans, and she tells me it\u2019s now a 7-8 night trip. After 3 days of being here and my sister borderline ignoring me and my mom (my sister would just sit in her room with her bf whilst I took my mum sight seeing, they only took us for dinners, and even some nights wanted to just order takeaway), I decide to bring my return flight forward to the day after the guided trip finishes because the city is not very pleasant and there is not much to do (we did all tourist sights in 3 days), my sisters house and the bedroom I\u2019m sleeping in is not very pleasant, and if I am going to sit around not doing anything, I would rather be at home.\n\nI told my mom my decision and tried to convince her to do the same as it seems my sister does not really want us here, however she does not want to cause a fuss so said she will stay alone until my sister gets back from her trip (3 days alone here).\n\nIt feels like my sister only wanted me here so that I would entertain our mom so she wouldn\u2019t have to (as above, she did very little with us). My sister has been telling me how I am selfish for leaving my mom alone to go home early, which is true, but I feel like my sister shouldn\u2019t have even gone on a 7/8 night trip whilst she had visitors that she invited here in the first place.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1703795089, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18t3kch/aita_for_leaving_my_sisters_christmas_vacation/", "score": 569, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA.  Flip her.  and if your mother desire to be a martyr to your sister's selfish behavior--that's her choice.", "NTA  \nYour sister is the asshole - clearly - for inviting your Mum across for - oh let's say 6 weeks she blythely suggested - knowing FULL WELL that she was toodle-dooing off with her buddies ofr a 7 - 8 night trip right on New Years.  \nWhat if you'd not been able to get time off from work?  or, had declined to go over for whatever reasons ?   \nWas she still going to leave Ma there by herself in a strange city in a foreign undeveloped country for 7 - 8 nights ?  Over New Years - when she could have been at home in her own home, seeing her own friends, and celebrating with you - in peace, comfort, and security.  How freaking RUDE .  \n\n\nI think Ma stayed out of misguided loyalty to the sister, and I think big lessons learned for both of you - Sis cares for nobody but herself.  Let her do the family tripping if she wants to see you from now on.", "NTA your sister invited your mother (and you) and so she is the host. She shouldn't be leaving for such an extended period, especially since she likely knew your mother's flight schedule before finalizing her NY plans. As the host, she's the one leaving your mother alone, not you.     \n\nYour sister is not only the ah but she's very selfish too.", "NTA but your sister sure is. I'm sorry mom didn't go back with you.", "NTA. Your sister is the selfish one.\n\nDoes she have the infrastructure so you could st least work remotely psrtbof the time if you visit again?", "YTA for leaving your mom after having agreed to stay with her. Why do you think abandoning your mom in an undeveloped country is ok? (And don\u2019t try to excuse yourself bc it\u2019s what your sister did. Nope. Your sister left your mom with YOU.)", "YTA, I completely understand wanting to leave early and it\u2019s not cool that your sister is ignoring you. However, leaving your mom basically alone in a foreign country is not ok. I\u2019d say suck it up and try your best to make the last couple days enjoyable for you and your mom.", "NTA\n\nYous sister is AH. So much so. She invited you so why would she go away when you are there? The whole planing of the trip seam very strange to me. You travel 12 h and she dosen\u2019t want to spend new years with you? Why would you agree to that in the first place. \n\nNTA your sisters is nuts", "Sounds like the sister needed some house sitters while she was gone.", "She definitely knew her flight schedule before she organised her NY plans", "Did we read the same story? The mom is a grownup lady who can literally do the same, go back home but she clearly is a doormat and stays to avoid the \u201cfuss\u201d. You don\u2019t invite people to undeveloped countries just to leave them home alone and expect other guests to pick up the slack for you. Btw, NTA.", "I agreed to stay with her for \u2018new years\u2019, not for a 7-8 nights while my sister goes on her own holiday. If my sister had asked me to stay with our mom in her house for 8 days while she goes on holiday, I would\u2019ve obviously said no and suggested we just go back home earlier", "To be clear: my sister has not booked her return flight from her trip so she could decide to cut her 8 night trip to 6 nights and therefore mean my mom isn\u2019t alone.", "I'm not sure why some folks are acting like Mom is actually a toddler wearing a wig and cannot be left alone.", "Well either way, good luck to you! Bummer that the trip didn\u2019t go as expected!", "NTA you and mom are house sitting. Your sister sucks.", "NTA. \n\nYour sister is a terrible host. How do you invite people to stay with you, just to ignore them almost the entire time?? I feel bad for your mom for having to be alone, but I think the both of you, the next time either of you go, now know to not stay too long, especially over the holidays.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is hosting you and your mother, yet it seems like she doesn't even want you there.", "NTA\n\nSis invited Mom and needs to host Mom.", "NTA!  \nWhat is wrong with your sister?? Why did she invite your mother in the first place? Why is your mother so willing to be ignored by your sister as her invited guest in a foreign country? Your rude, selfish sister is assigning her least desirable qualities to you!", "NTA at all. But maybe your mom wants the quiet time? Maybe mom is looking forward to being 100% alone. I know your sister seems to brushing you two off and frankly your sister seems exhausting but if I were you mother who travelled there, had to deal with sister drama (both of whom she loves) maybe she\u2019s actually ok with being by herself. It seems your mom doesn\u2019t want to make fuss because you are but did you legit ask her what she wants without portraying your angst about it all on her.", "I really don't understand why you're writing in. Your sister invited you to babysit your mom who she, apparently, invited to house sit for her while she took a 7-8 day trip elsewhere, all under the guise of inviting both of you to her place for a vacation. She's obviously TA and the selfish one. It boggles my mind why you wouldn't tell your sister off for abandoning the both of you for over a week. That is not normal.", "Nta your sister is the selfish one here. She's the a**hole. Who invites their mom then ditches them to go off on their own trip. Your sister is just rude.", "PC term is = Developing country. NOT Undeveloped country. Not Shit Hole Country ;)\n\nFWIW", "Ding...."]}
