Previously he lived with his ex girlfriend (Kira) who he had two children with. I love my grandsons and was very blessed that even from pregnancy that Kira let me be very involved as her mother died when she was very young and she doesn\u2019t have much family as she bounced around the foster system.\n\nEarly on even before the kids we became close and I viewed her as a daughter which my son encouraged. Last year while Kira was pregnant with their second they split up. My son blames Kira but I know from living with him and being a close support that it is at best 50/50. Once they split my son decided he didn\u2019t want anything to do with Kira or the kids and his previously encouraged and embraced view of our friendship turned and he wanted me to have nothing to do with Kira or the kids. I told him no. I was going to continue to be a big part of my grandkids and Kira\u2019s life.\n\nThis has caused some friction but we mostly operate on a don\u2019t ask don\u2019t tell. Once a week I go to Kira\u2019s to see the kids usually after I go grocery shopping. My son always gives me a list of what he wants and then I get that plus what I want and what I use to cook for us during the week ( I do all the cooking for me and my son but he often doesn\u2019t eat my food and opts for the ready made stuff he asks me to get him instead if that matters) and I always ask Kira if she needs anything. She usually says no but I still always bring some fruits and veggies. She likes the same food I do so I also will sometimes bring her part of what I get for myself if I know it\u2019s too much for me to eat during the week. \n\nAn example is salmon. My son hates fish but Kira and the kids love it. So I\u2019ll get a big one and portion it at Kira\u2019s and then bring home what I will eat for myself.\n\nFriday my son saw the receipt from the groceries and was irate how much the salmon cost for the amount I got. I told him the truth that I have 2/3rds of the salmon to Kira. He blew up and demanded I stop buying her groceries or if I continue he wants the same amount spent on him. The thing is I get him everything he asks for. It\u2019s just a box of pizza pops is less money than salmon. I also tend to get organic produce for myself and Kira and the boys but my son refuses to eat certain things if they are \u201corganic\u201d. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t make sense to me but he said I am an asshole and read me a post from here about another mom who gave better food to one kid over another so I thought maybe I would post.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for any errors. I do use Reddit but not this one so unsure of the rules.\n\nUpdate:\n\nOh my I did not expect to get so many messages. I am trying to keep up. It would seem I have some thinking to do. Many of you have pointed out I am enabling my son, I didn\u2019t think I was because I\u2019ve been very clear how I feel about him not being there for the boys but actions are as important as words. I will not stop being in Kira and the boys lives ever and in fact I will probably increase the amount of time and resources I give to them. \n\nI also want to just state in no uncertain terms as I have had a couple messages and comments about it, Kira was never unfaithful. Her only \u201ccrime\u201d was being unwilling to forgive my son for some actions unless he went to therapy which he did not do and rightfully informing HR at his former workplace of something relevant.", "created_utc": 1674432367, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10iyibi/aita_for_getting_my_sons_ex_better_food_than_him/", "score": 4392, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why is he the single man with no responsibility, whose mum even buys his shopping and cooks for him because its less hassle unable to do the same as a single mother of two kids?  \n\nAlso whats this about his cooking being too much hassle - and?

It\u2019s her house and her money.", "It's so clear that here I am, 10 hours after this post even happened, and I said the exact same thing in my judgment w/o seeing comments.", "Or it it easier because she has a sitter and doesn't have to bring strange men around her kids.", "Yes. If this was a teenager i could see a way to redemption. But at 35? Nope. Youre just an awful, awful human.", "Seriously, when my son was 16, he would go by the grocery store after school/ work and get his own stuff. If I was at the store and remembered he was out of something, I would grab it. Otherwise, he bought his own junk food. This guy is 35 and expects mommy to do it.", "Could have been texting female coworkers and harassing them and Kira found it.", "How can ANYONE hate chooks and horsies? \ud83d\ude04", "what's a chook?", "Wages can be garnished by the courts when he does work & passed on to Kira so she doesn't even have to deal with him on that. I've also known two people whose income tax refunds would be held and sent to the mother of their children until they're back child support was paid up.", "My guess is alcohol (drinking on or at job) or a substance. Imo OP housing her son is a last stop for him. Addiction would be a believable reason why he won\u2019t see the kids or discuss it. He\u2019s essentially broken their family. OP is good with words but that\u2019s my take.", "That sounds like he isn't paying anything right now, or isn't paying enough.\n\nYou're NTA, but I think other commenters are correct when they say a change is needed. I don't know if your son is depressed or something, but at 35 and with 2 kids he can't keep on in this way, hiding from his responsibilities in your home and basically regressing to childhood. I'm sure it's incredibly hard, but you're going to have to ask him to move out, and probably get professional help.", "Considering that your son brought this subreddit to your attention, believing in his mind that you were the AH in this situation, speaks volumes about your son's warped mental state. If you haven't already, please force him to read this post and the responses. He needs to know exactly how far off base he was.", "Letting him live in your house without consequences for his behavior is the enablement. Your talks in all these years have done nothing, at some point the nuclear option is to throw them out and make them figure it out themselves, let them return when conditions are met or leave them be if they can't do it.", "You are supporting his behavior by allowing him to continue to live in your house for free and feeding him for free. He shouldn't just be doing chores like a 12 ear old. He needs to be paying rent and child support. Stop allowing him to behave this way. Kick him out!", "> I just needed to stop trying to be responsible for him and just be responsible for me and my relationship with Kira and the boys.\n\nright, so cut off your son. He'll land on his feet once he doesn't have mommy buying his groceries and cooking his meals. He doesn't need your support.", "This needs all the upvotes ^^^", "This. My paternal grandmother financially adopted my mother after my father refused to pay child support. It was a blessing.", "I know this has been upvoted and commented on a million times but I'm making it a million and one, your son is a deadbeat, kick him out for your grandkids!", "As a mom with an A-hole son( BIG waste of skin type A hole). I  am NC with him for various reason. I do miss his help with hay and pasture clean up some one to buck and stack wood, clean barn( run wheel barrow)  things like that. So I understand that tradeoff. I raise his daughter and have since she was 10 months old, she is 12. Your son is behaving like  a bratty AH with his demands. You are so NTA. You can't make him be a dad but he can't stop you from being a gramma in any manner you see fit. As my bestie always liked to say\" Until your paycheck is on the table in my home you have no opinion and  if does show up. You still get no opinion.", "this mom doesnt recognize how extreme her coddling is. literally ruining this persons life. someone calls her out on it, and her response is \"well he has chores around the house\". like yeah, so did most of us growing up, but not at 35.", "Right?? And having her read an AITA post about favoring your children through food?? Like WTF? He's in his mid-30s!! And that food is going to his children!!! Did I just enter Crazy Town? \n\nMama Bear, you seem amazing, but I think you are well aware that your son is a loser and a mooch and--I get the feeling--something even worse.

He needs to go sink or swim on his own and she needs to go after child support.  Anyone that walks away from their kids and chooses to stop seeing them deserves to pay through the nose.  Quit enabling your son.  He doesn\u2019t deserve anything from you at all, ever.  You are awesome for helping her and the kids out.", "Your son isn\u2019t a kid. He\u2019s a ungrateful, deadbeat, mooching loser. You shouldn\u2019t be buying him a thing. He should be paying you and providing for his kids! Kick him to the curb.

Is he paying you anything to live with you? Is he doing anything to help you with the upkeep of your shared home? Does he still have a job? NTA, but your son certainly is one. Yes, you are enabling him, and you really should stop that.

Out of the kindness of your heart, you're letting him live like a child again, with no responsibilities or costs, and it's not helping.  And I can't image that you are happy living that way, being berated for buying your grandchildren food?  \n\nThe good thing is you've kept a great relationship with Kira and the kids, and they should be your focus now.  You should be living the life you want, which I assume is spending time with them, not being your adult son's servant.", "Ok, I'm going to be blunt. You're not doing your son any favors here. You're enabling him to act like a child by treating him like one. Why is he living with you at this age? Why are you shopping and cooking for him? Why are you taking care of the family he created? This is ridiculous. You can't live his life for him and then complain that you're disappointed by him being a deadbeat. You've taught him that his behavior is OK and that you'll run and fix all his mistakes for him. He acts the way he does BECAUSE YOU ALLOW IT. You can have all the arguments in the world, but when it comes down to it, you don't throw his lazy ass out. You give him chores like he's 15. You needed to stop being responsible for him YEARS AGO. You've created this monster yourself and you continue to feed it and it gets bigger and bigger. You haven't tried everything. In fact, you haven't tried the simplest thing of all -- kicking him out and forcing him to take care of himself.", "Kick him out. Stop letting him walk all over you just because he is your son. I hate to break it to you but he will never change and you are allowing him to be a burden and a deadbeat.  He is 35 and lost his job due to his own mistakes that HR had to get involved with.

I told him no. I was going to continue to be a big part of my grandkids and Kira\u2019s life.\"\n\nHow dare he, he is an arrogant ...  Thank you for staying involved with the grandkids and their mom. Your 'son' is not a man not in the very least of the word save that his gonads worked. Tell him to mind his business and do what he contracted to do when he had children. He is not a father, he is a sperm donor until then.

Why not apply his attitude to his children to your relationship with him? He clearly feels very comfortably entitled to your care and money. Are you never going to have your grandchildren over? Honestly he sounds like he does need therapy. I think you should make that a requirement of your own relationship with him since he is just taking advantage you and you are enabling the behavior that led to the break up as well as his hypocritical and deadbeat attitude to his children.", "NTA totally Team Kira here.

I know you can't make him step up and be a decent father, but you can make it clear that you find his behaviour unacceptable.

OP, I would give your son a move-out date and then have Kiera and the kids over a lot. Be there for them. Your son is a grown adult who seems to want to pretend he never had kids.
