Previously he lived with his ex girlfriend (Kira) who he had two children with. I love my grandsons and was very blessed that even from pregnancy that Kira let me be very involved as her mother died when she was very young and she doesn\u2019t have much family as she bounced around the foster system.\n\nEarly on even before the kids we became close and I viewed her as a daughter which my son encouraged. Last year while Kira was pregnant with their second they split up. My son blames Kira but I know from living with him and being a close support that it is at best 50/50. Once they split my son decided he didn\u2019t want anything to do with Kira or the kids and his previously encouraged and embraced view of our friendship turned and he wanted me to have nothing to do with Kira or the kids. I told him no. I was going to continue to be a big part of my grandkids and Kira\u2019s life.\n\nThis has caused some friction but we mostly operate on a don\u2019t ask don\u2019t tell. Once a week I go to Kira\u2019s to see the kids usually after I go grocery shopping. My son always gives me a list of what he wants and then I get that plus what I want and what I use to cook for us during the week ( I do all the cooking for me and my son but he often doesn\u2019t eat my food and opts for the ready made stuff he asks me to get him instead if that matters) and I always ask Kira if she needs anything. She usually says no but I still always bring some fruits and veggies. She likes the same food I do so I also will sometimes bring her part of what I get for myself if I know it\u2019s too much for me to eat during the week. \n\nAn example is salmon. My son hates fish but Kira and the kids love it. So I\u2019ll get a big one and portion it at Kira\u2019s and then bring home what I will eat for myself.\n\nFriday my son saw the receipt from the groceries and was irate how much the salmon cost for the amount I got. I told him the truth that I have 2/3rds of the salmon to Kira. He blew up and demanded I stop buying her groceries or if I continue he wants the same amount spent on him. The thing is I get him everything he asks for. It\u2019s just a box of pizza pops is less money than salmon. I also tend to get organic produce for myself and Kira and the boys but my son refuses to eat certain things if they are \u201corganic\u201d. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t make sense to me but he said I am an asshole and read me a post from here about another mom who gave better food to one kid over another so I thought maybe I would post.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for any errors. I do use Reddit but not this one so unsure of the rules.\n\nUpdate:\n\nOh my I did not expect to get so many messages. I am trying to keep up. It would seem I have some thinking to do. Many of you have pointed out I am enabling my son, I didn\u2019t think I was because I\u2019ve been very clear how I feel about him not being there for the boys but actions are as important as words. I will not stop being in Kira and the boys lives ever and in fact I will probably increase the amount of time and resources I give to them. \n\nI also want to just state in no uncertain terms as I have had a couple messages and comments about it, Kira was never unfaithful. Her only \u201ccrime\u201d was being unwilling to forgive my son for some actions unless he went to therapy which he did not do and rightfully informing HR at his former workplace of something relevant.", "created_utc": 1674432367, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10iyibi/aita_for_getting_my_sons_ex_better_food_than_him/", "score": 537, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're doing an amazing job, just focus on ensuring you are happy and healthy and let that guide your decision.", " NTA your son is one though. They are your grandchildren!", "NTA and your son is a completely gigantic AH. \n\nYou are being kind and a good grandma. Filling in a gap where your AH son has left. \n\nDoes your son pay for the groceries you go out and buy? Does he pay any rent? Utilities? Anything. It sounds like you have a 35 year old 10 year old living in your house.\n\nDeciding he doesn\u2019t want to have contact with his own children, fine - some people shouldn\u2019t be parents - but he needs to provide financial support in the very least.", "NTA!!! Don't let him take advantage, he will only get more demanding and controlling as you get older. If he's not verbally abusing you now he will eventually. Kick him out now while you can!", "Wonder how old Kira might be. \n\nAnd NTA!", "Only have to read the headline on this one. YTA, blood is always thicker than water, doesn\u2019t matter what it is. Someone you have known from birth. Nothing wrong with being close with the grand kids, but as far as the ex, she shouldn\u2019t exist anymore as it did. This is a person you met through your son, so wouldn\u2019t otherwise know, your loyalties should be with your son. Why this would require being explained is beyond me. You have given president over someone you raised, cared for, nurtured, cried with, shared highly vulnerable moments with, to some girl you wouldn\u2019t otherwise know. It\u2019s disgusting and heart breaking and I feel for your son and hope you take a moment and consider your actions. Beg forgiveness from your son. If it was me, I would never speak with you again. It\u2019s not only the food I imagine but you\u2019re judging the reactions on a simple item to weigh against all you have done to your son with this matter and behind his back. Shame on you.", "0 Chance. I don\u2019t know much about their court proceedings and child support but I do know for certain that a paternity test was done at some point I\u2019m not sure if it was ordered by the judge or not but I know it took place.", "Tell his girlfriend to sue him for child support. You shouldn\u2019t be spending to feed his kids- he should. NTA, but you need to start teaching your son consequences. At 35 he shouldn\u2019t be acting like this.", "You need to kick his ass out. \n\nWhy are you supporting his deadbeat ass?", "So he grew up not appreciating all you did, he saw it as the woman's responsibility.", "I believe that's called \"learned incompetence\". He knows he'll get what he wants if he kicks up enough of a fuss. You are, sadly, enabling this as you allow it to continue. You really need to kick him out. He needs to learn to be an adult.\n\nHow about you get Kira and your grandchildren to live with you once he's gone?... or move them in and let that be a natural catalyst to get him to move out! He sounds absolutely unbearable.", "My father abandoned my family at a young age.  50 years later, he\u2019s dead but I still hate him with the burning fury of a wildfire.  Tell your son if he wants his children to hate him forever, he\u2019s on the right path.", "Chores? He\u2019s not 15; he\u2019s a grown man who is taking advantage of you.", "I just want to throw a couple things out there for you to consider in case you haven't and it is obvious you care for everyone involved. \n1) as long as you are financially supporting your son there is no way for Kira to collect child support from him. Support would be much more helpful than salmon.\n2) even if you don't want to collect rent from him you could do so and give the money to Kira for support. \n\nIt is not helping your son to help him in the way you are and it is definitely not helping Kira and the kids you care about. I don't mean any of this in a mean way I just don't know if you realize you may be hurting them by supporting him the way you are.", "Thanks for answering! \n\nI\u2019m sorry your son has done this. Thank you for having your DIL and grandsons\u2019 backs!", "Yes yes yes!", "ABSOFUCKINLUTLY", "So say we all. NTA. Adopt Kira", "Also team adopt kira.", "Just throw him out and ask Kira and your grandchildren to move in with you. (If you have the space)", "It literally solves every problem OP has mentioned both in the post and in her comments. \n\nOP would still have people in the house and wouldn't be lonely.\n\nKira would be far more helpful than her son when it comes to helping around the house. And unlike her son, I'm sure Kira would help with cooking and wouldn't make OP cook her every meal and cater to her every demand.\n\nOP would save the money she was spending on her son. And since OP has mentioned feeling awful about her son being a deadbeat and wanting to help Kira, she can spend that money on the grandkids. Plus free/heavily reduced room and board would help make up for the current lack of child support. And she can help with the children, since her son refuses to.", "Eh, the son is definitely an AH but making someone homeless doesn't solve anything. It's crazy how people have that notion. Being homeless is hugely disruptive to someone's life. It doesn't make them become a better person", "So say we all!"]}
