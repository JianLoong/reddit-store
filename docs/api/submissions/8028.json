Last year while Kira was pregnant with their second they split up. My son blames Kira but I know from living with him and being a close support that it is at best 50/50. Once they split my son decided he didn\u2019t want anything to do with Kira or the kids and his previously encouraged and embraced view of our friendship turned and he wanted me to have nothing to do with Kira or the kids. I told him no. I was going to continue to be a big part of my grandkids and Kira\u2019s life.\n\nThis has caused some friction but we mostly operate on a don\u2019t ask don\u2019t tell.

I told him the truth that I have 2/3rds of the salmon to Kira. He blew up and demanded I stop buying her groceries or if I continue he wants the same amount spent on him. The thing is I get him everything he asks for. It\u2019s just a box of pizza pops is less money than salmon. I also tend to get organic produce for myself and Kira and the boys but my son refuses to eat certain things if they are \u201corganic\u201d. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t make sense to me but he said I am an asshole and read me a post from here about another mom who gave better food to one kid over another so I thought maybe I would post.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for any errors.

After this argument it may be a good time to tell him he is responsible for his grocery shopping now. He does have a job but he only started recently. He was let go from his last job because of some things related to the split so he was between jobs for a time. I am unsure on child support. He does not pay anything to me directly but he is expected to pay for certain materials for tasks I give him as part of his room and board.

You\u2019re enabling him and excusing his behaviors by \u2018just stopping fighting him\u2019. He\u2019s a grown adult who is a deadbeat father.

He just skipped the stuff you wanted, because he doesn't care about you. Or the kids he's made. Or the woman he's left with the burden of raising them alone. He got food for who he cared about. **Himself**"]}
