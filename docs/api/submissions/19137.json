Surely she can observe you going out earlier?", "Soft YTA. Have that conversation. Explain to her why you don't like running with her, and give her a chance to change her behaviour. Without any guidance... that's a lot more difficult.", "NTA for getting annoyed, and wanting to run with your Brother, but\n\nYTA for not being honest with her. Perhaps, you guys can find a middle ground. Shes 13, why lie, instead of having an honest convo with her and your parents involved, and find a middle ground.", "YTA - but it's because you didn't actually communicate with your sister.\n\nShe's the youngest, and she likes you guys. She's literally willing to try and do something she has little to no experience in just to spend some time with you guys. \n\nAlso, a 13 yr old doesn't really need a babysitter... she just needs to feel like it's not her against you and your brother. If you want to talk, talk... if that messes up her pacing, she could wear earbuds until she's got it down. You could also try to show her proper running technique so gets better at running with you guys.\n\nShe's your sister, and if you really want to isolate her from you and your brother, that's your prerogative... but it's also one of the bigger reasons I'm 34 yrs old and haven't spoken to my own sisters in over a decade... they have kids I've never met, and whole lives I know nothing about, because as a kid it was me vs them, so as an adult I didn't see a good reason to continue dealing with people who didn't seem to give a damn about me. \n\nDo as you like, but you should consider how that will impact your relationships with her and your brother. Siblings don't automatically love each other because they're related... that's a myth... ALL relationships take work and effort.", "YTA. \n\nBut only slightly. A 4 year age difference is big at this junction in life. I know because I'm 4 years off from my brother. So there's going to be different levels of ability and endurance in running. \n\nI also think that maybe she's looking up to her brothers and wants to become closer. She's probably seen how you and your brother have gotten closer, and wants that connection as well.\n\nIn my opinion, it would show great maturity on your part if you did have a conversation with her, and compromise if possible. Maybe she can join you guys if she stops complaining during the run and works on her form and stride?\n\nIn the end, it's not okay to lie. I understand why you did, but it's just prolonging the inevitable conversation.", "NTA\n\nYou should probably just tell her not to come along, but I'm sure it's just so much easier to get up earlier. It's completely OK to have something that you do together with just your brother. And kudos to you for getting up at 4:30.", "NTA I get the people saying this should have been a conversation with your sister, but this seems like a bigger issue stemming from your parents and their favoritism. It sounds like you\u2019re ignoring her instead of calling her out in order to keep the peace in your family. The damaged family dynamic isn\u2019t your responsibility to solve", "NTA. You don't have to do anything that involves someone that annoys you and ruins the morning. I can tell by most of these comments they don't have little sisters that love ruining things for others. This is YOUR tradition and morning routine and she is actively disturbing them. My little sisters are 4-5 years younger than me and my mom would always give me and my brother shit for not including them, even when they would purposely ruin our events and time with our friends.

I'll do some introspection and change my way of thinking.\"  No.  It's going to be a knock down, drag out, screaming fest that will get nothing done other than ruining your run again.   I'm sorry your parents refuse to, you know, parent, and handle this.", "NTA.  Your sister is simply not your \"equal\" running partner and having her tag along surely affects the efficiency of your run, all other things aside.

If she continues to disturb you guys (getting mad at wanting to run for longer and telling you guys to be quiet), and disregards your expectations then you should let her know it doesn\u2019t work to run together and that is final.", "NTA.

I am old so I may be out of date about teen stuff sorry if this is silly in todays world.  \n\nIf she is trying to be a part of your world you might be able to find an activity that you can tolerate and would make her feel special.   She may be a bratty golden child because as the only girl, she is always left out of bro stuff.  So parents overcompensate.   Could you bear a trip to the mall or ice cream/coffee shop?   A pleasant round of video games in which you handicap yourself to make it fun and fair?   Maybe give it a shot a few times and see if her brat level improves and you find out she is  possibly a decent little sister.", "YTA. Your sister clearly wants to spend time with you, and yes she doesn't know how to do it perfectly yet and need to learn. Plus I guess her legs are not the same size than yours. What about you explain to her that you will run with her at a different time, a smaller distance to teach her the right technique, and then when she is a bit older and can maintain a certain time/speed she will be able to join. If you feel that your sister is a golden child you need to speak to your parents calmly and constructively, with concrete evidence. Regarding snitching, maybe she needs to learn the difference between what is important and what is not, maybe you can explain the difference and how it impacts on trust and your relationship. However, and to be fair, if you are doing something you really shouldn't do, it is not on the person that speaks up but on the person who did something they shouldn't have.", "NTA", "NTA and YTA.

She\u2019s still young enough to seem childish to you but very soon she\u2019ll hit the stage in her life where things click and she\u2019ll be more relatable.

If successful, she will learn to run. She'll head home before you if she can't keep up. Her behaviour will improve because she will have learned something about putting in effort instead of just getting things because she's the youngest.

You and your brother have an age and hormonal advantage that means you can handle the run better. Maybe do the run with your brother. And do a separate, shorter run with her. Or alternate days?

What we did as a solution was that I run about 50 meters ahead and return to her and constantly go back and forth. I can understand how it might disrupt the pacing but after she found her pace at the 5th run we were almost the same speed and had much less issues.

She\u2019s welcome to join if she can learn to keep up (maybe it\u2019s only a few days a week) and understands that you guys are doing this as an exercise and will be keeping a certain pace. On the behavioral side, same thing applies. Let her know you want to include her if she is willing to be more of a team player and consider the whole dynamic and learn to compromise better. It\u2019s also fine to say that this is an important bonding time for you and your brother and that you want to keep a certain pace and if she finds it distracting to run while you guys are talking she can run on her own time.

The only solution is to be honest. \n\nUnfortunately, I truly think it doesn't matter because it's going to backfire. It's going to go two ways, she gets mad and doesn't want to run with them which I guess is great for them until she tells her parents why and they get in trouble if she is indeed the golden child, or two, she gets angry and complains to the parents who will force them to let her run and they also still get in trouble for being mean to the Golden child.  \n\nThis feels like a no-win, honesty because the probably isn't her form, or the pace. the problem is that her presence does change the point/effects of the run. Her form can be corrected sure, her endurance will get better, but the no talking rule might not go away, and significantly her presences doesn't make it a safe space to talk if there's the constant fear that whatever they say may be told to the parents until she hopefully grow out of telling on her brothers phase. \n\nThe best scenario may be to find something else you can do with her, like ok the morning runs are brother bonding times, but maybe after-school/weekends you can find an exercise/activity you can do all together so she doesn't feel left out.

She needs to be willing to learn and not complain if she is joking yalls run. \n\nOr maybe let her come one time a week? Or go on smaller runs in the afternoon with her if you could.

If you wanted a form check, you should have asked someone.", "I like this - I think you can explain to her the morning runs are more for you and your brother because you are both very serious about running (ie: form, distance, time, etc). Ask if she is interested in learning more about running. I would imagine she does because waking up at 6:30am to run is not a simple commitment (even for a week) for someone that hates running. I speak from experience as someone that HATES RUNNING. \n\nIt sounds like she either wants to join in on sibling bonding time or she wants to learn (or both). If she wants to learn then I would suggest maybe spending some time during your morning runs teaching her. Maybe she can join in with you guys the last few miles and then slowly build up to the full thing. And perhaps putting yourself in a mentor position might improve your relationship? \n\nIf she hates running but is just doing it to spend time with you, then maybe you can suggest another sibling event that you can all do together. \n\nTalk to her about her behavior though, but try to be understanding that she is young and it just comes with the territory that she is bratty. It might be annoying but maybe she can get through it with your help!", "I'd also add - as a woman who runs - that running alone as a female can sometimes feel quite isolated and intimidating (and I'm tall, fully grown and confident). For a 13 year old, who is infinitely more vulnerable to the bad thinks of the world, this group run might be the difference between her taking up running seriously, and giving up sport completely (a huge number of girls ditch all forms of exercise by age 14). This opportunity of running with you, her brothers, could be genuinely life changing. I also find that regular exercise has a positive impact on my hormones and mood, potentially regular running will help her to chill out a bit and navigate her early teens.  Yes she is bratty and annoying... but she is much younger than you. I'd also remind you that how her parents treat her is not her fault any more than how they treat you is your fault. It sucks for you all to have a golden child dynamic.\n\nYou don't HAVE to run with her OP. No one can make you. But it would be kind, and good for her, and would potentially help you understand one another a bit better. And it is ok to set ground rules. Like, if you want to come with us, this is how it will be. Explain to her about pacing herself etc (every newbie runner starts out at a sprint then wonders why they are gassed). You could turn running into something she loves and is proud of, just like it is for you. It is clear she admires you both or she wouldn't want to come along. I hope that one day you are all running a big race together and laughing about this story.", "Please don't give me advice if I have bad form. I have bad form for a reason, TY!", "I agree with this.

The only AHs in the context are the parents who don't enforce boundaries with their child so her brothers grow to resent her. The way to fix the situation is to grow a better relationship with the sister and enforcing boundaries with her, before it is too late.
