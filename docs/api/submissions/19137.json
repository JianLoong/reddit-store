Surely she can observe you going out earlier?", "Soft YTA. Have that conversation. Explain to her why you don't like running with her, and give her a chance to change her behaviour. Without any guidance... that's a lot more difficult.", "NTA for getting annoyed, and wanting to run with your Brother, but\n\nYTA for not being honest with her. Perhaps, you guys can find a middle ground. Shes 13, why lie, instead of having an honest convo with her and your parents involved, and find a middle ground.", "YTA - but it's because you didn't actually communicate with your sister.\n\nShe's the youngest, and she likes you guys. She's literally willing to try and do something she has little to no experience in just to spend some time with you guys. \n\nAlso, a 13 yr old doesn't really need a babysitter... she just needs to feel like it's not her against you and your brother. If you want to talk, talk... if that messes up her pacing, she could wear earbuds until she's got it down. You could also try to show her proper running technique so gets better at running with you guys.\n\nShe's your sister, and if you really want to isolate her from you and your brother, that's your prerogative... but it's also one of the bigger reasons I'm 34 yrs old and haven't spoken to my own sisters in over a decade... they have kids I've never met, and whole lives I know nothing about, because as a kid it was me vs them, so as an adult I didn't see a good reason to continue dealing with people who didn't seem to give a damn about me. \n\nDo as you like, but you should consider how that will impact your relationships with her and your brother. Siblings don't automatically love each other because they're related... that's a myth... ALL relationships take work and effort.", "YTA. \n\nBut only slightly. A 4 year age difference is big at this junction in life. I know because I'm 4 years off from my brother. So there's going to be different levels of ability and endurance in running. \n\nI also think that maybe she's looking up to her brothers and wants to become closer. She's probably seen how you and your brother have gotten closer, and wants that connection as well.\n\nIn my opinion, it would show great maturity on your part if you did have a conversation with her, and compromise if possible. Maybe she can join you guys if she stops complaining during the run and works on her form and stride?\n\nIn the end, it's not okay to lie. I understand why you did, but it's just prolonging the inevitable conversation.", "NTA\n\nYou should probably just tell her not to come along, but I'm sure it's just so much easier to get up earlier.

You don't have to do anything that involves someone that annoys you and ruins the morning. I can tell by most of these comments they don't have little sisters that love ruining things for others. This is YOUR tradition and morning routine and she is actively disturbing them.

I'm sorry your parents refuse to, you know, parent, and handle this.", "NTA.  Your sister is simply not your \"equal\" running partner and having her tag along surely affects the efficiency of your run, all other things aside.

I am old so I may be out of date about teen stuff sorry if this is silly in todays world.  \n\nIf she is trying to be a part of your world you might be able to find an activity that you can tolerate and would make her feel special.   She may be a bratty golden child because as the only girl, she is always left out of bro stuff.  So parents overcompensate.   Could you bear a trip to the mall or ice cream/coffee shop?   A pleasant round of video games in which you handicap yourself to make it fun and fair?   Maybe give it a shot a few times and see if her brat level improves and you find out she is  possibly a decent little sister.", "YTA. Your sister clearly wants to spend time with you, and yes she doesn't know how to do it perfectly yet and need to learn. Plus I guess her legs are not the same size than yours. What about you explain to her that you will run with her at a different time, a smaller distance to teach her the right technique, and then when she is a bit older and can maintain a certain time/speed she will be able to join. If you feel that your sister is a golden child you need to speak to your parents calmly and constructively, with concrete evidence. Regarding snitching, maybe she needs to learn the difference between what is important and what is not, maybe you can explain the difference and how it impacts on trust and your relationship. However, and to be fair, if you are doing something you really shouldn't do, it is not on the person that speaks up but on the person who did something they shouldn't have.", "NTA", "NTA and YTA.

The only solution is to be honest. \n\nUnfortunately, I truly think it doesn't matter because it's going to backfire. It's going to go two ways, she gets mad and doesn't want to run with them which I guess is great for them until she tells her parents why and they get in trouble if she is indeed the golden child, or two, she gets angry and complains to the parents who will force them to let her run and they also still get in trouble for being mean to the golden child.  \n\nThis feels like a no-win, honestly, because the probably isn't her form or the pace. the problem is that her presence does change the point/effects of the run. Her form can be corrected sure, her endurance will get better, but the no talking rule might not go away, and significantly her presence doesn't make it a safe space to talk if there's the constant fear that whatever they say may be told to the parents until she hopefully grow out of the telling on her brothers phase. \n\nThe best scenario may be to find something else you can do with her, like ok the morning runs are brother bonding times, but maybe after-school/weekends you can find an exercise/activity you can do all together so she doesn't feel left out.

I speak from experience as someone that HATES RUNNING. \n\nIt sounds like she either wants to join in on sibling bonding time or she wants to learn (or both). If she wants to learn then I would suggest maybe spending some time during your morning runs teaching her. Maybe she can join in with you guys the last few miles and then slowly build up to the full thing. And perhaps putting yourself in a mentor position might improve your relationship? \n\nIf she hates running but is just doing it to spend time with you, then maybe you can suggest another sibling event that you can all do together. \n\nTalk to her about her behavior though, but try to be understanding that she is young and it just comes with the territory that she is bratty. It might be annoying but maybe she can get through it with your help!", "I'd also add - as a woman who runs - that running alone as a female can sometimes feel quite isolated and intimidating (and I'm tall, fully grown and confident). For a 13 year old, who is infinitely more vulnerable to the bad thinks of the world, this group run might be the difference between her taking up running seriously, and giving up sport completely (a huge number of girls ditch all forms of exercise by age 14). This opportunity of running with you, her brothers, could be genuinely life changing. I also find that regular exercise has a positive impact on my hormones and mood, potentially regular running will help her to chill out a bit and navigate her early teens.  Yes she is bratty and annoying... but she is much younger than you. I'd also remind you that how her parents treat her is not her fault any more than how they treat you is your fault. It sucks for you all to have a golden child dynamic.\n\nYou don't HAVE to run with her OP. No one can make you. But it would be kind, and good for her, and would potentially help you understand one another a bit better. And it is ok to set ground rules. Like, if you want to come with us, this is how it will be. Explain to her about pacing herself etc (every newbie runner starts out at a sprint then wonders why they are gassed). You could turn running into something she loves and is proud of, just like it is for you. It is clear she admires you both or she wouldn't want to come along.

OP needs to establish rules and probably help her learn the techniques so she can join them in the future when she's not going to cramp their pace.

The way to fix the situation is to grow a better relationship with the sister and enforcing boundaries with her, before it is too late.

And it baffled me that despite everything, she still considered me her cool older sibling, a person that she still admires and looks up to. She still has some attitudes that annoys me a lot, but our bond is stronger than petty arguments here and there.

These arbitrary expectations honestly creates animosity between the siblings. Personally, I disliked my younger sister for a long time because of this. If the younger sister really wanted to learn how to run, then she can look it up online or join track and field at her school. Or maybe the parents can do their job and teach her themselves.

As I watch my sister raise her kids, I often have to think about my own childhood. We kids weren\u2019t treated difficulty, at any given time we were just different ages. A 13 year old won\u2019t act the same as a 17 year old. Also, the way these two were raised is different.

If you want to save her, you can tell her she is welcome to join you, and don't insinuate, TELL HER a few pointers that are non-negotiable. Golden children are groomed to lack empathy, so she may not be aware of your feelings. Tell her running is a great way for you to relax, and relate to brother. She can be a part of it if she respects the process. You may wind up giving her her first actual accomplishment. You may be the difference between a life where she doesn't understand why no one wants to be with her, and a life of accomplishment", "Soft YTA. Maybe pick one day a week to run with her,  and teach her about running?", "People are wild in here! Outright excluding her is not the right way to treat your younger sibling who is making their version of an effort to be included. Setting expectations for what it means to be included is absolutely appropriate, and even if she throws a fit now and thinks it\u2019s stupid because she\u2019s a kid, it leaves the door open for her to join when she\u2019s ready to really show up. Make it clear that this isn\u2019t negotiable, she plays by your rules or she doesn\u2019t play, but don\u2019t cut her out. This isn\u2019t a stranger that you have no obligation to! Your younger siblings deserve grace and kindness while they struggle through their adolescence. She might really want to participate but\u2026 there\u2019s just so much weird emotional shit when you\u2019re a 13 year old girl. The fact that she was getting up that early at an age when humans need SO MUCH sleep says she cares. Give her a chance - just not on her terms. And if she isn\u2019t up to this activity, find another way to spend quality, active time with her - she very obviously wants it.", "I think it's possible to accommodate your sister in this situation. Teach her the basics, give her the guidelines for running with you, and maybe you can even alter the route if she needs to finish early and you two can keep going. if she refuses to comply and is disturbing the run, then go back to the other schedule.\n\nNAH", "NTA. I think the sister is only trying to run with them to make their experience and time together about herself. Golden child and the enabling parents never seem to see nor understand that they're forcing a situation to become difficult. \nThe funky comments about mechanics makes you assholie. She can learn. Take her out later in the day when you have time if you and she want. Then if she rejoin or let you and your brother have your bonding time together.", "It won\u2019t work. When my sister was 13 I was 16 and my brother was 15 and her and my parents would often force her on to us because \u201cshe gets bullied and has not friends\u201d she didn\u2019t get bullied people just didn\u2019t put up with her bullshit. \n\n\n\n\nWe tried talking to our sister, showing her how things were done etc but it always ended in her having a tantrum and trying to get us in trouble with our parents.", "The other people aren\u2019t coaches and a lot of people have different running styles. Maybe they thought that\u2019s how you feel most comfortable running.", "It really sucks having a sibling relationship like this. I'm the younger of two with my brother having a similar age gap to me as you do with yours. I tried for *years* to build a relationship with him. I'd occasionally text or call him (like, maybe three or four times a year) and he'd either not pick up or not respond or not call back. \n\nAt holidays, he'd ask me about stuff I was doing when we were in the same house but it was clear he wasn't actually interested. His eyes would glaze over after about ten seconds. So I'd cut the conversation short given his disinterest. \n\nI just learned over time that I'm not a priority to him and so I stopped trying. \n\nBut the most grating, hurtful thing about all of this was he clearly has cemented the identify of \"good older brother\" to himself. How he'd \"protect me\" or \"be there for me\" if I needed help. But it's just self-important blowhard bullshit. Like, how can he be there for me if he never picks up when I call or can't even be bothered to learn anything about me. Like, his knowledge of me as a person stopped after high school. He doesn't know me at all and has no actual interest in changing that, no matter how much he says otherwise.\n\nBut the real nail in the coffin was a few years ago, before the pandemic began. He'd been saying for years about how he'd like to come visit me (I live halfway across the country from the rest of my family. Can't imagine why \ud83d\ude44). I've been out here for about eleven years now and he has a childhood friend that lives in the neighboring state. He'd visit him sometimes but not me. Okay, fine, that's a bit of a drive, I'm not mad about that. Or, I wasn't. Until I learned from my childhood friend, who is the younger sibling of my brother's friend, that his brother *and my brother* had visited *my city* together *multiple times* since I moved here, that something finally just broke in me.\n\nHe doesn't care. He's never cared. He only cares about the idea of being a good older brother. But he doesn't actually want to be my older brother. So I stopped trying.", "Don\u2019t feel shitty anymore. You\u2019ve recognized your bad behavior, and have an action plan to improve it. That\u2019s pretty impressive considering I see people twice your age on here whining in the comments. \n\nBy the time you\u2019re all in your 30s, that age gap isn\u2019t going to matter anymore, but any bonding you do in the next few years will. Good luck!", "Damn bro, grow up \ud83d\udc80", "Good point. I stand corrected.", "Is a 13yo girl really going to be able to keep up with a 17yo almost man? I think she\u2019s missing out on sibling time but I don\u2019t think this is the right activity for them", "You know what turns kids against parents? Forcing them to be a parent and teach a sibling who\u2019s awful to be around.", "This is one of those points where we raise whether your parents basically just dumped younger siblings with you and provided no support or guidance in regard to it and...given you had no other examples, you didn't see this as them failing to parent. If that happened to you and you've decided it's fine for that to happen to you, okay.", "True. If the sister is willing to compromise than 1 or 2 days a week would work. I'm not sure the sister will but it is worth a try.", "But it can be especially with two boys that age (or two girls). To add in a younger sibling who is a different sex - that can be an issue. You then add it that they don't feel comfortable talking about many things because either it isn't appropriate for younger sister or because they fear she will tell parents what they've talked about.", "that's really sweet thank you, the messages on here have been really nice!", "Yep. And sometimes the golden child buys into it, basically brainwashed. If she wasn't complaining about everything in a run including just talking between the brothers, I'd be inclined to think the way you think things are could be the case.", "She's being lied to and denied the opportunity to fix the issues OP has with her running all because of her parents' reactions. How is that fair.", "He\u2019s not an instructor just a kid who wants to run and get fit.", ">Chances are\n\nWhy? Based on what?\n\nReading something uncharitably isn't any better than reading it charitably. Maybe he's going on runs to sell drugs as well - it's bottomless the amount you can read into a text if you just give up on charitable reading.", "I guess we know where you are now. And can move forward with your individual lives.", "You're deciding for both of us whether there is enough evidence, as if you're the one between us to decide for both of us. You aren't, it's just your opinion. Ok, opinion noted, good day.", "I'm an eighteen year-old, and I'm the middle child, older bro is two years older, younger sis is two years younger. I'm a guy.\n\nTook me way too long to stop shitting on my sister (12-13), but we're all closer now, though me and my brother just share more similar interests", "Speculation is pretty important considering the amount of buried ledes you get here", "Running comes naturally to humans, but swimming does not...", "Maybe she has no willing heart, but just wants to participate in her older brothers activities, just to be together with them. Which isn't a bad thing, but older brothers also should have ability to say \"Sorry, sis, not this. We can do something together, but the running is our time to excercise.\"  \nDo you really think, that 13yo girl is able to keep pace with 17yo boy in sport activities?   \nThey can do together something different. Why should she spoil their training?", "I mean, he may have a valid point. If you usually receive a lot of texts and one day you dont, that could be a sign something is off. If you dont receive a lot of texts then you probably wouldnt. \n\nLike, I have a prepaid phone and last month I didnt realize my payment hadnt gone through until about halfway through the day when I realized I had gotten any of the usual 20000000 spam calls offering me an extended warranty on my car that hasnt been new since 2005. It was unusual for my phone to be silent so I noticed, but if my phone was usually silent I wouldnt have noticed", "It\u2019s worthwhile for OP to try to see things from a more mature perspective, assuming he\u2019d like to have a better relationship with his sister going forward. \n\nEven if she\u2019s objectively insufferable, lying and sneaking out to avoid her is not the way to go. Conflict resolution is an important life skill. He needs to talk to her about what\u2019s bothering him and then set boundaries.", "Because one is something he can clarify and one is something we have to take at face value", "That doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t accept his assessment that she\u2019s a brat.", "Idk I feel like this sub has gotten really picky with the details - he said she was bratty so just accept it. If he said she was quiet would you want examples? It\u2019s not as though the whole post revolves around this one description.\n\nI mean really, if you were telling a story to a friend and said \u201cmy boss is grumpy in the mornings so I don\u2019t go out of my way to match up our coffee breaks\u201d would your friend say, \u201cwell you haven\u2019t given me specific examples of him being grumpy so I can\u2019t actually believe that\u201d", "Hard NTA. OP and his brother have bonded over running together in the mornings and clearly have trained properly. What do you think teenage boys talk about in private? It's about more than just exercise. If those were my boys, I'd be thrilled with their commitment and wouldn't force their younger sister on them.\n\nI keep shaking my head at people saying \"it would be nice\". Eff nice. Inclusion isn't always the answer. Big happy family doesn't always work. OP wouldn't be here if he was okay with including sister. They were getting up at 4:30 (2 whole hours earlier) to avoid her. That says a lot.\n\nThe parents were fine to ask, but they should respect the arrangement and encourage something else. If it ain't broke, don't fix it and don't mess with something you are passionate about just because someone wants to hone in on it.\n\nSince OP is NTA, he can find something else to include her in that they all can enjoy without any assholery.", "NTA- My sister was four and a half years younger than me and likewise a brat. I refused to ever supervise her in any way and explained it to my mother as \"She will purposely do the opposite of anything I say just to be annoying, she will do anything she can to cause me trouble, it's not safe for me or for her to give her the chance to be extra awful.\" My mother couldn't argue with that as she'd seen it enough times. Tell your parents that her attitude will put all three of you at risk, so if they want her to run, they have to run with her.", "ESH\n\nCan\u2019t she come on a bicycle?", "Reread the part you wrote about joint running improving the relationship you have with your brother.", "She's 13, why dont YOU grow up?

Edit : Yta", "It's male bonding time guys so sis needs to butt out according to OP. How about being big bro to her too and teaching her to run properly?

How do you think your parents will take you lying?\n\nInstead, sit her and your parents down, and let her know that she is not physically able to keep the pace with your and your brother. She is slowing you down and making the workout less effective, with her wanting to go for short runs. \n\nIf she wants to join you guys see needs to work on her form and endurance so that she can keep up the pace you set. \n\nThen offer to help her with her form. Teach her the right way to run, then let her build up her stamina and endurance on her own. \n\nThis will allow you to keep going on your runs, and show that you care about your sister and want to include her, but that she has to put in some work in order to not ruin the exercise. \n\nThis also puts it on her if she really wants to run, or just wants to bother you. She might just give up and quit, or she will step up and be a better runner. \n\nEither way you come off as being helpful and inclusive. \n\nSlight YTA for lying about rather than dealing with it.", "Very soft YTA. Only because you shouldn\u2019t lie to her. She\u2019s 13 - she\u2019s a child. When you chat to her, say that you and your brother like to run together so that you and him can bond. She\u2019s probably feeling left out and wants to be accepted by her big brothers. Maybe suggest an activity that the three of you can all do together- a super special sibling time! But the running is for you and your brother.", "YTA. It\u2019s so disrespectful to just lie. Be honest and ask your parents that they teach her if she wants to learn.", "Can u go for a run just the 2 of u and come back to get her after a certain time? She won\u2019t be tired for the longer run, u guys\u2019ll have time to spend alone and pace at ur own rhythm and she won\u2019t feel excluded. Btw I admire ur dedication to get up early and exercise.\n\nAnswering the question, NTA, but she is young and prob wants to be more like her bigger siblings.

Maybe even at her school. Or she can get together with a friend who is also at her level. The parents should help her find a place where she is WELCOME\n\nAlso, it is fair for the brothers to be able to spend time without the sister. 17 year old doesn\u00b4t want to always have to bring a 13 year old along, it creates resentment.", "I'm in my mid-30s and I know shit about running. Apart from, you know, placing one foot in front of the other and trying not to trip over my feet while doing so.\n\nI'm also pretty sure that neither OP nor his brother knew about pacing and stuff when they first started running.", "I agree with this, she is a beginner and she will hold them back at this time, if the brothers are going out for a run in the morning before school they have a training plan of some sort they are following.
