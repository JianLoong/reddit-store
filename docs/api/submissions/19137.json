Surely she can observe you going out earlier?", "Soft YTA. Have that conversation. Explain to her why you don't like running with her, and give her a chance to change her behaviour. Without any guidance... that's a lot more difficult.", "NTA for getting annoyed, and wanting to run with your Brother, but\n\nYTA for not being honest with her. Perhaps, you guys can find a middle ground. Shes 13, why lie, instead of having an honest convo with her and your parents involved, and find a middle ground.", "YTA - but it's because you didn't actually communicate with your sister.\n\nShe's the youngest, and she likes you guys. She's literally willing to try and do something she has little to no experience in just to spend some time with you guys. \n\nAlso, a 13 yr old doesn't really need a babysitter... she just needs to feel like it's not her against you and your brother. If you want to talk, talk... if that messes up her pacing, she could wear earbuds until she's got it down. You could also try to show her proper running technique so gets better at running with you guys.\n\nShe's your sister, and if you really want to isolate her from you and your brother, that's your prerogative... but it's also one of the bigger reasons I'm 34 yrs old and haven't spoken to my own sisters in over a decade... they have kids I've never met, and whole lives I know nothing about, because as a kid it was me vs them, so as an adult I didn't see a good reason to continue dealing with people who didn't seem to give a damn about me. \n\nDo as you like, but you should consider how that will impact your relationships with her and your brother. Siblings don't automatically love each other because they're related... that's a myth... ALL relationships take work and effort.", "YTA. \n\nBut only slightly. A 4 year age difference is big at this junction in life. I know because I'm 4 years off from my brother. So there's going to be different levels of ability and endurance in running. \n\nI also think that maybe she's looking up to her brothers and wants to become closer. She's probably seen how you and your brother have gotten closer, and wants that connection as well.\n\nIn my opinion, it would show great maturity on your part if you did have a conversation with her, and compromise if possible. Maybe she can join you guys if she stops complaining during the run and works on her form and stride?\n\nIn the end, it's not okay to lie. I understand why you did, but it's just prolonging the inevitable conversation.", "NTA\n\nYou should probably just tell her not to come along, but I'm sure it's just so much easier to get up earlier. It's completely OK to have something that you do together with just your brother. And kudos to you for getting up at 4:30.", "NTA I get the people saying this should have been a conversation with your sister, but this seems like a bigger issue stemming from your parents and their favoritism. It sounds like you\u2019re ignoring her instead of calling her out in order to keep the peace in your family. The damaged family dynamic isn\u2019t your responsibility to solve", "NTA. You don't have to do anything that involves someone that annoys you and ruins the morning. I can tell by most of these comments they don't have little sisters that love ruining things for others. This is YOUR tradition and morning routine and she is actively disturbing them. My little sisters are 4-5 years younger than me and my mom would always give me and my brother shit for not including them, even when they would purposely ruin our events and time with our friends. It is the most annoying thing in the world.", "NTA.  You're a kid.  This isn't your job.  This is something your parents should be handling.... but I see they're not doing a bang up job. Think, though.  *What would be accomplished by telling her you don't want her there?*  How will that go down? \"Oh, jeez, you think I'm a snitch and a brat?  Wow, thanks for telling me! I'll do some introspection and change my way of thinking.\"  No.  It's going to be a knock down, drag out, screaming fest that will get nothing done other than ruining your run again.   I'm sorry your parents refuse to, you know, parent, and handle this.", "NTA.  Your sister is simply not your \"equal\" running partner and having her tag along surely affects the efficiency of your run, all other things aside.  Your parents should be told this and should understand and honor this.  That said, confess to your parents the time change you made and why.  Hopefully they will then be able to support you and your brother in running without an inexperienced thirteen year old dragging you down.", "NTA.\n\nYou cannot have a conversation with a child who has parents who won't change their stance on their behaviour. You can complain all you want, but at 13 your parents are the ones who make the rules. You are adding extra work to your life by trying to confront someone who gets their way.\n\nTell your brother that honesty is a great trait to have... but honesty that solves nothing is pointless. You can be honest with your sister and then you never get to run alone again.", "NTA\n\nI understand not wanting someone to come along and \u201cdisturbing the peace.\u201d I do, however, think you both should\u2019ve let her know what you guys expected if she still wanted to join. If she continues to disturb you guys (getting mad at wanting to run for longer and telling you guys to be quiet), and disregards your expectations then you should let her know it doesn\u2019t work to run together and that is final.", "NTA. I would imagine the physical fitness and endurance between a 13 year old and a 17 year old are very different. But I would of just told her no instead of lying about it", "NAH. I am old so I may be out of date about teen stuff sorry if this is silly in todays world.  \n\nIf she is trying to be a part of your world you might be able to find an activity that you can tolerate and would make her feel special.   She may be a bratty golden child because as the only girl, she is always left out of bro stuff.  So parents overcompensate.   Could you bear a trip to the mall or ice cream/coffee shop?   A pleasant round of video games in which you handicap yourself to make it fun and fair?   Maybe give it a shot a few times and see if her brat level improves and you find out she is  possibly a decent little sister.", "YTA. Your sister clearly wants to spend time with you, and yes she doesn't know how to do it perfectly yet and need to learn. Plus I guess her legs are not the same size than yours. What about you explain to her that you will run with her at a different time, a smaller distance to teach her the right technique, and then when she is a bit older and can maintain a certain time/speed she will be able to join. If you feel that your sister is a golden child you need to speak to your parents calmly and constructively, with concrete evidence. Regarding snitching, maybe she needs to learn the difference between what is important and what is not, maybe you can explain the difference and how it impacts on trust and your relationship. However, and to be fair, if you are doing something you really shouldn't do, it is not on the person that speaks up but on the person who did something they shouldn't have.", "NTA", "NTA and YTA. Sucky situation but the right thing to do is be honest.", "Don\u2019t tell her she\u2019s not welcome. Tell her she\u2019s can choose to start at the same time as you, but you\u2019re always going to run at your own pace. You can all leave at 630. Run just like you would with anyone group. You should keep your pace, and she can keep hers. You can\u2019t be expected to train at her pace. There\u2019s no need to justify or explain. Just start together, and each run at your own pace. \n\nESH", "I\u2019m going with soft Yta, I realize you are all siblings and teens.

I Can totally see why you don\u2019t want her there and I think that\u2019s completely okay. Instead, find a bonding activity that the 3 of you can do together: once a week watch a new show together, get coffee, go for a slow walk.

God forbid there is an accident or injury and no one knows where you guys are. \n\nHow did you learn \"proper foot placement\", or whatever? Someone taught you. Why can't you do that for her? Neither you nor your little brother were born knowing any of this, so why do you expect her to? \n\nYou think communication in this scenario is too much work?

You need to learn to handle issues effectively and this is a good, low stakes way of doing it. \n\nYour sister is trying to bond with you guys, why are you trying to kill that?

If she sees something wrong, of course she\u2019s going to want to tell an adult. It is extremely important to never make her feel like she\u2019s in the wrong for snitching. What happens if you tell her that snitching is bad and then someone does something awful to her, and then she feels like SHE\u2019S the bad person if she speaks up??
