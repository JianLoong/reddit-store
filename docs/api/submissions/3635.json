After seeing how hard MIL had to work, and the expectations the extended family put on her, I have always been vocal about the fact that I was never cooking a full holiday dinner for everyone. I know my limitations, and I don't want to invite that stress to my life during an already stressful time. However, now that my MIL has passed away, there is an expectation that my husband and I will go to his dad's house to cook for everyone with his brother's help, while his dad, uncle, uncle's fiancee, and both grandparents sit around doing nothing. \n\nI want to suggest a potluck type of thing, where everyone brings a dish. However, I asked everyone to do that for the luncheon we hosted after my MIL's funeral, and my husband's grandmother felt like she was asked to do too much. (I asked her to bring paper plates and napkins.) \n\nBefore my MIL died, she said that the grandparents have always expected to be served a full meal plus leftovers for them to take home.

BUT maybe that's not such a loss, because what they want you to do, this year and every year, is exactly what you have always said you never want to do. If you do not draw a line this year, however, it will be much harder to do it in the future and will probably cause more bad will.", "I personally love cooking. And love cooking a full meal. My kids like helping. But I still would not cook for a family that was just demanding i do it for people unwilling to help. It\u2019s sad some people just expect to be served and make somebody do all the work for holidays. If they won\u2019t lift a finger they don\u2019t get their party. You\u2019re right to stick to your statement. They\u2019ll treat you like their servant and make forever if you give in. It\u2019s unfair and ridiculous. When my parents moved out of state we never had another big family get together for any holiday because nobody was willing to do any work to host.

And keep the vino handy.", "You\u2019re a guest. It\u2019s not your house. FIL is hosting. So by that logic it\u2019s rude to request you, husband and brother bring anything either.", ">I think so too, but the extended family thinks it's rude to request guests to bring food or something like that.\n\nGiven that everyone is going to FILs, that makes zero sense. Everybody except him is a guest. Who exactly is deciding who's a guest and who's the help? Isn't the host front and centre in the \"relax and watch TV\" crowd?", "Don't let them claim it's bad mannered to be asked to contribute. It's hella bad mannered to bully someone into managing and cooking a meal they don't want to do, EVERY YEAR. Just say no.", "Perfect, this is exactly what you need to do, just be prepared for complaints!!  I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll hear \u201cOP ruined Christmas!\u201d  Such BS and now that MIL is gone things will be different so they WILL have to get used to it, no going back!  Way to go OP!!", "You definitely shouldn\u2019t pay for your FIL to host HIS relatives at HIS house.", "Looks like you have an iron-clad excuse not to cater Christmas, then. \"Can't afford it, sorry. Inflation. You know how it is.\"", "Tell her she's 65 now and is old enough to do it herself.", "I\u2019m struggling to understand the functional difference between the MIL and the DIL of the deceased, neither of whom are the host. What I mean is, you\u2019re not a closer relative than she is, nor are you the host. In fact, she\u2019s kind of the matriarch of the family. Why would you be less of a guest than she is?", "Who knew a third hole between your legs came with such heavy burdens.", "Probably the same way as most of us who have vaginas and are cursed to be involved with a family like this, being a deliberately horrible cook. That or OP does understand the difference between fiance and fiancee and the uncle is engaged to a man.", "\u201cTraditional\u201d is a four letter word. \n\nMy own Mother passed away this year. I\u2019ve become the matriarch of our family. I\u2019m much older than you but I\u2019ve put the kabash on a lot of things. This has been very difficult as my younger sister has Down\u2019s Syndrome and lived with my parents. She demanded a lot from my Mother and Mom really never learned to say no. My sister struggles with the permanence of death or any changes to her routines, so it\u2019s been an uphill battle. \n\nDon\u2019t let yourself get drawn into the web of backwards expectations that your MIL lived and died within. Stick to your guns. \n\nNTA", "You'd be the asshole if you did agree. Do it once and you'll do it forever. You aren't their cook. Stay at home or volunteer to bring a dish and nothing more.

Order pizza with turkey on it, let grandparents take the leftover slices with 'em.", "And I assume they expect you to pay for everything as well.  My dad\u2018s family was like that, making his mom/grandma do everything.  Then when it was done only women were expected to do dishes and the men just sat around.  She didn\u2019t have a dishwasher so this was a lot of work.  One year at the end of the meal I stood up and asked that everyone carry their dish out, scrape it and wash it then I lined up men and women to dry and put things away.  One male relative started to complain and I asked him to explain why only woman are expected to clean and just stared at him.  Anyway from then on the men helped.  Honestly I just think no one ever insisted that they help.", "NTA\n\nNo one but guests ever get to sit around and do nothing in my house. If you are blood family or been married in long enough, you get off your arse and help.

How\u2019d you like to have that expectation laid on your head not just this year  but  then the next and the next? It will be if you give in even  just  this once. And the arguments will get more bitter and un-winnable by all parties, all  while  your  resentment grows  and  grows  until  things  are  not  the same  between  you  and  your  husband over it.  It is better to suggest that a new tradition is in order. I don\u2019t know if a potluck would work when so many would probably just turn up without a dish since they\u2019re not used to helping. Maybe go crazy and meet at a restaurant?", "Who expects someone to go to THEIR house and cook for them? NTA", "NTA\n\nWhere is the expectation you talked about coming from? Have you been explicitly asked to cook? The laziness of your husband\u2019s grandparents is not your problem to manage. Take this opportunity to reset things. Have a nice quiet Christmas at home with your husband, brother (26) and FIL since, although he\u2019s lazy he\u2019s recently bereaved. The grandparents can be catered to by their child and his fianc\u00e9(e).\n\nThe potluck isn\u2019t a great idea because someone who\u2019s unhappy about being asked to bring plates to their own child\u2019s funeral lunch is either going to demonstrate weaponised incompetence, flat out refuse to help and complain non stop. Spare yourself this.", "NTA, if you are keen on keeping your relationship with them healthy order takeout/catering. \nIf they are not okay with that and want you to bust your a** cooking, just don't do anything.", "You would so be NTA... don't do it ...you don't like it so just don't", "NTA order pizza.", "NTA I\u2019d suggest that your husband (because it\u2019s his family) send a group message saying we\u2019ll bring (whatever you\u2019re comfortable with) & ask who\u2019s bringing what, so that you don\u2019t take any leadership role at all. \n\nOf course you can help or make a dish but even you organising things allows them to let the work fall back on you.
