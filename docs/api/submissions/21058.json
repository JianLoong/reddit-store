He was 6 years old at the time. He has two other children, 17M and 13 F that are his biologically. Since then he and his ex wife have gotten a divorce, and he has partial custody over his two biological children, while his ex has full custody of the youngest.   \nThe youngest was, needless to say, devastated when the man he knew as his father suddenly stopped showing him any kind of affection and said he wasn\u2019t his father anymore. He still has a very anxious attachment style as far as I\u2019ve observed, and he\u2019s been in therapy for three years now. He has problems at school and I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s being bullied for it.   \nHis oldest became distant with him after this. He was 13 at the time, and you can see pretty clearly that he\u2019s less affectionate with his father than he used to be. After a while, he started asking me to help him with things that he would normally ask his father for, and he started coming over a lot more after school. Honestly I\u2019m pretty sure he has dinner with grandma and grandpa more often than he does either of his parents.   \n10M still comes around to our house pretty often, too. Since the divorce I\u2019ve noticed 13F pull away from her parents as well \u2013 a year or two after the divorce she asked my wife to take her shopping for a Christmas dress, for example.   \nIt all came to a head in the past couple of weeks. First it was 17M\u2019s graduation. My wife and I were invited, and he pretty much ignored his dad the whole time. Then apparently he posted a picture of me and him to the Instagram with a caption that says something like \u201ccouldn\u2019t have done it all without the man who made me a man.\u201d After that it was the fact that his boy scout troop does this canoeing trip over Father\u2019s Day weekend, and he invited me to come instead of his dad.     \nMy son complained to me that he barely has a relationship with his kids now, and he thinks I\u2019m horning in on his role as their father.

The others, as you say, have formed a bond with you because you have shown yourself reliable, unconditionally - which is what children need.   \n\n\nWell done.     \n\n\nAs for your daughter's advice to effectively abandon the children now to \"let them sort it out\", why would you take such cruel advice, when your instincts are loving and kind?", "\"It's not a competition. Whether I am in their life or not, you will still have a troubled relationship with your kids. Your mother has some theories as to why that is, so you may want to discuss any advice or insights she might have for you. But you know what will definitely *not* repair your bond with your kids? Wasting time complaining to me.\"\n\nNTA. And your daughter has an incredible amount of nerve to suggest that you basically abandon your grandchildren to try to manipulate them. Also, that's not how it works: if they already feel somewhat abandoned by their father, and then you abandon them, all you are teaching them is that father figures are unreliable, and they shouldn't trust either of you", "It appears you\u2019re just a caring & kind man. The last thing in the world these kids need is for grandma & grandpa to change the relationship that has already been established. If your son wants a better relationship with his kids then he needs to do the work. Suggest he try family counseling with his kids & help them manage their feelings. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Your son showed all of the children that love is conditional and arbitrary. I agree that they are pre-abandoning him, and he deserves it. They don\u2019t trust him. They have seen what he did to their sibling and the pain that it caused. I doubt they trust their mother either, since her actions precipitated this.\n\nYou are doing a good thing by stepping up and being present for all of them. They need stability and certainty in their lives and their family relationships, and you are providing that.", "NTA-as far as I\u2019m concerned, this is now all about the kids: their health, safety, and development. You cannot abandon them also. \n\nTalk to your son. Tell him that you understand that he\u2019s hurting. Please ask him to consider going to therapy with you. That said, tell it like it is. You know that ex-wife caused enormous pain for all of them, but beg him to not put you in the position of hurting the kids more. If you abandon those kids now, don\u2019t you think that they would just blame Dad for that too? It doesn\u2019t help him win them over. Dad is already hurting. Hurting the kids won\u2019t fix that.", "NTA. Speak with your son and tell him that you love all of them but you don\u2019t want your grandchildren to feel abandoned by you so you want to speak with them first and try to find out what is going on. Then, just talk to your grandchildren and ask them what is going on with their relationship with their dad? After the discussion I would tell them that you would like to arrange for family counseling for all of you and see where that leads. Once the counselor gets involved back out of the situation when they advise you to do so. Yes, your son needs to try to resolve this situation but your grandchildren need to know that you won\u2019t abandon them as well. Good luck!", "NTA - Please do not step away or make yourself small in their lives. Stepping out will do significant harm (e.g., shatter their sense of safety, normalcy, understanding of unconditional love). You would be mirroring the same behavior your son did to their younger sibling.\n\nYour son's decision shaped how they view him. Can you imagine what it was like for the older brother to watch their father emotionally and physically abandon the youngest? This will have pervasive and damaging impact on them all. You cannot fix this.\n\nIf you receive pressure to step back ask those inquiring to evaluate their presence and investment in these boys and level up. They are to look inward not outward to you changing.  Best to you!", "NTA, and your wife might be right, or it might be even simpler - they realized their dad was an asshole from watching their ten year old bros pain.\n\nSucks the situation dad got put in, but he has decades of adulthood to guide him, a ten year old child who is objectively blameless doesn\u2019t.\n\nNo shock that his siblings went \u201chuh, dads an asshole\u201d. Good for you for being an amazing grandad.\n\nI hate it when people take adult issues out on children and expect them to understand with adult discrimination. Adults don\u2019t even tend to be good at \u201cadult discrimination\u201d they - on the whole - tend to expect it from others and not themselves.", "Sounds like NTA but do you think the parents are alienating the kids because they didn\u2019t resolve their beef with each other so it\u2019s coming out in how they interact with the kids?\n\nThis happens all the damn time with divorce and it sucks for the kids. \n\nAs the dad to your son, you might think about if you can help your son not lose his connection with his kids if this is going on.", "I almost wanted to say N A H, but I'm going with NTA.

Nice. I hope your daughter does not have children in this mix, she's giving you bad advice.\n\n10M has no father figure but you. The other two grandchildren have you and your son...a father who's already proven he's willing to run out on a 6yo because of his own hurt feelings. \n\n>she says it\u2019s because after he dropped 10M his other two didn\u2019t trust him anymore and they \u201cpre-abandoned\u201d him\n\nYep, I think she's right. And so are the kids' instincts: your son is a sketchy pillar of their lives. \n\nYou need to ignore your son's complaints, and stick to all three of those kids like construction epoxy, OP. They really, really need you.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  But your son is.  You don\u2019t turn your back on a kid you raised as your son because the woman you chose to marry cheated on you and lied to you.  You should be a father to him and make that clear and tell him to man up.  Of course his other children hate what he has done to their little brother.  Do everything you can to help those kids.", "NTA.", "NTA. Your son *abandoned* one of his children because it wasn't his sperm that fertilized the egg that created the child. In every other way, your son was that child's father, and your son just straight up abandoned his child because of something the child had no control over or knowledge of. And now he's surprised that his other kids don't trust him?!? Really? He set that ship to sail and burned it when he let all his kids know that he'd be willing to dump any of them in a heartbeat, just like he already did to his youngest (and most vulnerable) child.\n\nContinue to be there for your grandkids. Your son is the AH.", "That maybe why the children are separating from their father however, your wife is not a psychologist and I think rejecting your grandchildren would be a terrible idea. Your son needs to fix the bond he broke with the 10m child. You don\u2019t just stop loving someone because their blood is different.", "NTA. Your son and daughter-in-law are both the AH\u2019s here. It\u2019s unfortunate, because the adults often don\u2019t consider the affect their actions will have on their children. Secrets never stay secret. Your son should be ashamed of himself for walking away from the young child that he has raised for 10 years, leaving that child to flounder. A father isn\u2019t always the man who provided the sperm, it\u2019s often the man who steps up and treats the child like their own regardless of DNA. He\u2019s using that child to punish his ex-wife for her transgressions, which clearly make her an AH. Your son and/or his ex need to talk with the youngest\u2019s therapist about initiating family counseling. That is something you could certainly be a part of. For now, I think it\u2019s great that you have stepped up to be there for the children. They need you, don\u2019t walk away like their father did.", "NTA. This whole situation is rough. Supporting the kids is generally good.  It sounds like there are definitely some hurt feelings too.  Sorry", "NTA your grandkids saw their father reject their brother because of DNA, sounds like they've since rejected their father in solidarity with their brother.\n\nDo not listen to your daughter, that will just alienate the kids from you. No one likes to be manipulated and the kids are old enough to understand that's what you'd be doing.", "NTA, they are connecting to you because they trust and need you. If you back away you'll be doing to them what your son did to 10M\n\nEven if they did not have another option they would probably still not become closer to him again. If he wants to change that he probably has to try and step up for 10m but honestly the damage is done from the sounds of it", "NTA. The youngest child didn\u2019t deserve this, and I\u2019m glad that you too haven\u2019t abandoned him. Your other grandchildren respect you more because they see your love as unconditional. Your son is punishing a child for something he had no control over. Keep being a hero and don\u2019t let your son or daughter encourage you to be anything other than that.\n\nYou would win the biggest hero award if you took the youngest on a special adventure. Fishing, ice cream sneak out, or anything that can be bonding experience. Or take both boys at times. But whatever you do, never show him as being less than. If he wants to talk about it, just tell him that there is nothing to discuss. You have loved him since he was born, and nothing will ever change that.", "NTA\n\nI'd like to preface this with the fact that I don't have a relationship with my own father. My mother, half -sister and I immigrated when I was 7 and my sister was 13 for safety reasons. This was over 10 years ago. My mother's number has never changed in all that time and my father never made the effort to reach out so our relationship naturally soured. With that being said I've always wanted a father figure but I could never look at my bio-dad in that light because he severed our relationship on his own and went as far as to slander my mother.\n\nYou and your wife saw 3 kids suffering because of the actions of those who were meant to protect them. Their failed relationship with their parents is in now way your fault. You did everything you could to provide care and love for children who no longer felt that from their own parents. Your and wife's choice to step up was the best thing for those kids because they weren't being prioritized in a situation where they should have been. Your son's and ex-dil's failed relationship has nothing do with you and your wife's involvement and everything to do with their own idiocy and immaturity.", "NTA but your daughter is right.

But the way your son reacted to that pain ended up hurting his kids.\n\nHonestly your son and all three kids should go to therapy.  Good on you for developing relationships with your grandkids.  The cheating created a lot of trauma, and your relationships with your gtandkids helped them through that trauma.", "NTA- for being there when wanted. But you should be just grandpa. Their father has every right to feel the way he does about the youngest. But he should\u2019ve went about this a different way because of how young he is. He doesn\u2019t understand what happened, he thinks he was abandoned by his father when he isn\u2019t the father at all.\n\nIf he tried to be in his other kids life, I\u2019m not sure why they did that to him. He doesn\u2019t deserve to be pre-abandoned when he is still in his two other kids life. He isn\u2019t the youngests\u2019s father and he certainly isn\u2019t entitled to raising him or even having anything to do with him. This is the mothers fault. She is the one that has caused all this to begin with, having the affair, getting pregnant and then him finding out 6 years too late. She should\u2019ve tried to explain this to all of the kids and why he felt this way. He wasn\u2019t abandoning his two kids, he was only detaching from the one that isn\u2019t. I\u2019m sure she put the blame on him for leaving and probably told them that he would abandoned them as well since he did the 6 yr old. But the 6 yr old isn\u2019t his. He doesn\u2019t have to raise another man\u2019s kid especially one from an affair after having their own two. He resents the kid and his wife. It\u2019s a sad situation. But if he tried to be in the kids life whether they invited him or not, then there is no reason to be complaining. So something tells me he didn\u2019t abandon just the 6 yr old. He didn\u2019t come around for any of them til he wanted to and showed his time was only available when it fit him.\n\nThis same situation happened to my dad in his 20\u2019s and he divorced her and never spoke to either of them again. They didn\u2019t have other kids though together and he went on to have his own, and then adopted me at 50. He is 77 now. When he was 65, apparently that woman kept telling that boy he was his dad and that he abandoned them and that he is worthless and all this. The man was 40 at the time and then him and my father got a dna test because he kept insisting he was his dad and that his mom is right and wanted a relationship with him. The DNA came back as negative. And the man wouldn\u2019t believe it and kept asking for another. He wouldn\u2019t accept the truth, as he was never told. Then his mother finally told him the truth when she heard about the results. He ended up getting cancer that next year and then he committed himself and passed. My dad felt sorry for him, but he was angry with the mother for lying to him for years until those results came. That was not his fault.", "That last part hits... She wants OP to \"abandon\" them as well to force a relationship with the other person who abandoned the 10 year old...Does she really think that will work?", "shows who aunt cares about, and it\u2019s not the kids. nta.", "I was thinking they must carry a tremendous amount of guilt as well, maintaining a relationship with the man who abandoned their sibling so cruelly.

You're evil.", "I\u2019d expect it depends on how she has treated them.  You\u2019re supposed to love your children more than you hate your ex in a situation like this.  Hopefully she has been able to do that.", "NTA it\u2019s because of what he did to their brother. ALL they see is DNA matters to your son not the established bonded relationship. Overnight he stopped loving a son. It could just as easily been one of them. They don\u2019t respect him. And probably never will. THEY NEED YOU.", "Nta. Your daughter is stupid. Do no abandon your grandson like his dad did to his son .  Your son has a cold heart for what he did to the 10 year old.  A father is not the sperm donor, it is the man that takes care of the children.  He ruined his relationships with his children and now is trying to blame others.", "You stepped up at a time your three grandchildren needed you to. One because he was abandoned by the only father he knew, the other two because their own relationships with their father has been damaged. \n\nI'm no psychologist, but it seems to me that second half of your daughter's idea, that you shouldn't give those kids the option of coming to you until their relationship with their father is worked out comes with two very big risks - risk 1, they blame their dad for the enforced distance from the grandparents they love and it breaks their remaining relationship with him completely, and risk 2, they feel like you've abandoned them too and decide to go NC with the entire family.  \n\nNTA", "NTA but I feel sorry for your son, OP. He's going through a hardship", "Nta. Sounds like they support their little brother who has been unfairly treated.", "NTA. Your son was, very understandably, hurt to have been cheated on. But what his children all saw was him abandoning the youngest for something that is not his fault and not in his control which severely affected the youngest. He inadvertently taught his children that his love is conditional and so the older two are pulling away from him to preempt being abandoned by him themselves. Your son needs to listen to your wife and go see a therapist. Your daughter needs to shut up about things she does not understand. Trying to get you to abandon the older two to force them to interact with their father will only make things worse.", "NTA. \n\nTheir mom is an AH for obvious reasons. \n\nDad made it abundantly clear that his love was conditional. The kids get to respond to that how they see fit. \n\nYou're not stealing anything. You're just having a relationship with people who want you around.

There are kids who trust you and look up to you as a role model, it\u2019s an amazing thing really.

All you do is being there for the children.\n\nThe thing is, what happened to your son is not fair and I fully blame the mother. She caused all thag.\n\nBut his children watching him not wanting anything to do with the child he raised, makes them think he doesn't really love any of them and that is a valid emition as well and probably true.
