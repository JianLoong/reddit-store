Odd that there's a pattern where those who say I am, favor the mother.", "yeah, this screams fake to me too.\n\nThe time line is spread out over several comments, but it appears to be something along the lines of:\n\nOP starts working at their workplace \"about\" or \"nearly\" a year ago. \"almost\" 10 months ago, the co-worker starts having issues. OP claims this is \"before her first positive pregnancy test\" (pin this for later). This appears to also be about the same time that OP has a falling out with their co-worker over some as yet unclarified \"personal choices\" they each made. Last week, OP gets fed up with co-worker's behaviour, writes a report, and co-worker is fired the next day (pin this one too). OP then finds out that the co-worker was actually \"almost 8 months pregnant\" - so..... pregnant for the vast majority of the \"nearly ten months\" that these problems have been occurring. \n\nNow to the pins, and some other things - \n\nOP states that they didn't know how pregnant their co-worker was when they reported her, but apparently *does* know when the co-worker first tested positive as pregnant (because they claimed the problems were before the first positive test). They commented on the nausea the co-worker had, and the level of tiredness the co-worker had, said that they talked with the co-worker several times about her pregnancy and workplace accommodations and FMLA. So OP is *very* well informed about the co-worker's pregnancy symptoms, date of their first positive test, what help is/isn't available... but didn't know how far along the co-worker was? Plus they justified reporting the co-worker on this being a pattern of behaviour that *pre-existed* the pregnancy, but now can't decide if they knew when the co-worker became pregnant (again, knows about the test) or were surprised about \"her very late pregnancy\" status? \n\nOP seems to know a lot about the number of days off and what permissions were given to the co-worker, which sounds unusual and possibly a breach of privacy. They also repeatedly tried to talk to their co-worker about her pregnancy despite it being a \"sensitive\" topic, and saying that the co-worker was \"hostile\" when it came to discussing the pregnancy\". They claim to know about the accommodations offered to their co-worker, and details about why the co-worker was allegedly not fired beforehand, which again seems like a breach of privacy and possibly HR info.\n\nOP also knows about reports from other departments, including how many reports, what they were for, and who made them. This also seems like an unusual level of detail for OP to have. \n\nOP has *at least* once the last \"nearly 10 months\" recorded their co-worker. OP is unclear in the comments about whether it was once, or whether it was multiple times. \"camera footage displayed her actions spanning the 10 months as well\" is a quote from one of OP's comments, but in other places OP claims it was only one picture.\n\nOP says they did a written report, with recorded evidence, submitted it, and then the co-worker was fired *the next day*. There was no mention in OP's post about multiple reports from multiple departments, or conversations from management, or their own conversations with their co-worker, or any of that, until it was pointed out in the comments that it would be unusual for a single report to result in someone getting fired so fast.\n\nI'm highly suspicious of the \"we were really close when we started working there, but drifted apart after (unspecified) personal choices that we both made\" context. Especially since that seems to ... *coincidentally*.... coincide with when OP starts recording their co-worker, when the co-worker became pregnant (not saying OP is involved in that, just that the times seem to match up), when OP starts having a problem with the co-worker's productivity, and when OP starts to monitor the co-worker's actions/behaviours. \n\nI'm suspicious of the complaining that OP does about the co-worker *while at the same time* telling us how \"genuinely pleasing\" she is to talk to outside of work (so OP and co-worker socialised outside of work too then, I assume?). It gives a weird vibe when combined with OP's comments about how they *repeatedly* tried to talk to the co-worker about her pregnancy despite being given very clear indications that the co-worker did not want to talk about it with OP.\n\nI am *very* curious to know what OP's actual relationship with their co-worker was. Because currently what I'm getting  - if this is real - is some heavy stalker/creeper vibes from OP. I would *not* be surprised if OP approached their co-worker for a more personal relationship, was refused, and has then decided to take advantage of the co-worker's medical and personal situation to make the workplace uncomfortable and get them into trouble. \n\nOP is at best an unreliable narrator, or at worse a troll, but either way I have spent way too much time being completely weirded out by their writing style when I should have been studying lol.", "I blame my ignorance for not noticing her very late pregnancy sooner.

The point of the pregnancy being an excuse is because these were behaviors that she picked up before being pregnant which makes it all that much more complicated.

Smh", "I specifically asked if you would want someone to get you fired if you had a rough time so I believe I was pretty clear that ANYONE should be given some extra consideration if they had a rough time.", "Normal human beings don\u2019t secretly video their coworkers when they hit a \u201cbreaking point\u201d. That is not in any way a normal thing to do. That is really messed up. And if you genuinely think that your course of action is what a decent human being would do, you wouldn\u2019t be asking AITH about it in the first place.", "Some action was needed for sure. But the timing and circumstances were off.\n\nI hope your self reflection also considers these factors", "She\u2019s the devil but doesnt want to look in the mirror.", "I guess I licked my own boots for the betterment of, well, everyone afflicted by the situation.", "Ten months is pretty considerable I'd say and I bet you would agree. I would personally want to be let go if I were so miserable that I needed far more help than just a paycheck on top of ignoring that many helping hands.", "The evidence given was well within my right and camera footage displayed her actions spanning the 10 months as well. Is it unfair? Sure. You could possibly bridge that out if she had more leverage.", "They do now", "[deleted]", "OP, I\u2019m reading your replies, and it seems like you\u2019re not really asking - you already believe you\u2019re not an AH, but feel guilty because now you\u2019re realizing this was a young, pregnant woman in distress, and you assumed the worst of her. I don\u2019t know whether you\u2019re the AH or not, but I surely would feel awful if I had a hand in making her life worse, too.", "Yea sure buddy lemme know when and how the new hire workout...", "Because poverty always improve a bad situation. \n\nIf you already sucked it up for 10 months, why not the last couple of weeks and then she would have been gone?", "so you recorded her over a period of nearly ten months?", "How much slack can be cut until most others in the work environment suffer as well?", "That's where I'm able to see the comments of people who have had better solutions to a situation I exacerbated. I believe what I did was within my right, but it is sad considering her circumstances. I am still an AH but to some it is just and to some others, it is not. I appreciate feedback for both.", ">If you already sucked it up for 10 months, why not the last couple of weeks and then she would have been gone?\n\nPeople don't exactly get to decide when their breaking point is.", "[deleted]", "I think it\u2019s not much help to this woman for you to ruminate on what you *did* - that is a self-serving exercise. She would be better served by you thinking of solutions to help her now that she\u2019s jobless and losing custody of at least one (and maybe now two) kids. If there was any way to help her find training or another job or anything, this would be the time to offer it. She is very young to have so much on her shoulders.", "No, but _recording_ their coworker. That's just evil (and possible illegal depending on location). You can let your employer know so they can intervene and sort out a situation but recording shows that OP didn't care for any other solution than getting their pregnant coworker fired. But since OP gladly would be fired themself if they had a difficult time I guess it's fine to be evil.", "So you are saying it's up to OP? As a co worker?", "They decided 10 months was enough.", "Is it necessarily my duty to help her? Besides that, you make a good point that some constructive solutions like training could make more sense in this case.", "The deflection from the original comment shows progress in our understanding of each other's viewpoint. I was well within my right to record (take a picture) of them and if that is evil because she is a mother than the extent of her selfish actions may also hold an opinionated remark.", "Wow. Did your company shake your hand and thank you for having documented proof that her being fired had nothing to do with her protected class?", " No need for you to be more concerned about her personal life than she is herself. She KNEW what was at risk if she lost her job and still didn\u2019t take it seriously. Why should you? Especially when you had no idea about her personal life.", "NTA", "NTA", "OT isn't necessarily extra money if their salaried employees. Plus maybe they had their own kids they missed time with or who were otherwise affected by working an hour overtime every day for 10 months. Or not. That is actually irrelevant.", "We don\u2019t know if OP and coworker were salaried or not. For the sake of discussion, let\u2019s assume OP wasn\u2019t. That means Coworker was probably paid biweekly as would OP. With that logic, OP costing coworker her job didn\u2019t just cost her much needed FMLA time but also much needed income."]}
