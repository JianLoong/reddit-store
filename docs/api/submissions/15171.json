Its just what youre used to and know her by.\n\nJust tell her what you wrote here. No matter what word you use to refer to her as, so long as she knows how much you love and appreciate her as your parent.", "NTA. Same for my son and his stepdad. He doesnt say 'dad' but calls him by name. Does not make him any less of a father to him. Sounds like the same for you. Just because you don't call her mom, does not mean she does not feel like your mom, or that you dont treat her or respect her like your mom. Shes not less your mom because you call her by her own name. Maybe she just needs to hear that so you both can feel good about this subject.", "NAH - you should call her whatever you\u2019re comfortable calling her but if you think she\u2019s upset by this maybe have a little heart to heart with her about it.", "NTA. My stepson called me \"Chief\".", "NTA , don't force yourself to call her that , assuming by her reaction she probably subconsciously expects you to call her mom but just open up about how you feel , not putting a label on someone doesn't invalidate the love you have for them .", "NTA but maybe say this is my parent?  you could come up with a fun nickname that isn't mom... or if you ever have kids you can call her \"grandma\" when your kids do", "NTA. Call her whatever is comfortable with you.", "NTA. It should come from the heart and be said voluntarily.", "NTA\n\nIf you're not feeling calling her 'mum' then you're not feeling it.  Nothing you can do about it.  Presumably your respectful to her, listen to her, maybe even go to her for advice or help with things.\n\nThis is just what happens.  You have memories of your mum and nothing can take that away from you.", "It sounds like she doesn't have a problem so Idk why you're dad is pushing it. Also even if she did it's whatever you're comfortable with. Nta", "OP has a dilemma. Step mom obviously loves her, but OP just can't call her mom. I understand both sides, this is a difficult issue.", "Maybe she's not your mother... But sounds like she is your mum.\n\nHow lovely to have had 2 moms that both love and cherish you. And that you feel the same.  It's a rare thing.\n\nIt feels awkward cause it would be different.  But....  It's Just different.", "NTA. This kind of change should happen naturally or not at all. If it doesn\u2019t happen, that\u2019s OK!", "NAH\n\nmaybe do it once and hide it as a mistake. It would probably make her day", "NTA. I would definitely sit her down and tell her everything you've said here. She might not know how you feel. Maybe come up with a nickname or something you could start calling her instead?", "NTA - my mom married my stepdad when I was 5 but had been with us (my older sibling) as a close friend since before I was born. He raised me and was more of a dad to me than my biodad has ever been. I still never called him dad. It wasn\u2019t that he wasn\u2019t my dad, it was the meaning behind the word, and to me, his first name met more to me than the word \u2018dad\u2019. My sister however did occasionally call him \u2018pops\u2019, but that never really caught on for me.", "INFO. Why does it feel awkward to call her mom? I can imagine if your bio mom died at a later time in your life but you were 5, 17 years ago. Your step mom is the only mother figure you have actually known. Do you dislike her, and is your way to express your dislike?", "NTA, but I think you missed the boat here. The time to fully accept your stepmother as mother was when you were a chid she was raising; in her place, I think I would find it more awkward and performative than meaningful for a 20something stepchild to start calling me \"mom\".  It's sad that you didn't feel comfortable giving that title to the woman who raised you, but it is what it is. Starting now out of some sense of obligation likely wouldn't fix anything, and it's pretty clear you don't really want to. It sounds as if both she and your father have stopped mentioning the subject, so let sleeping dogs lie. You don't have a mother, only the memory of one, by your own choice. You do have a stepmother, and she sounds like a good one, so keep nurturing that relationship.", "NAH. You probably see her in that role and may not have acknowledged it- please introspect. However, this is your decision, and it is good to see that she respects that.", "You\u2019ve made a mistake here, a critical one. You\u2019ve omitted the interpersonal conflict. I think that your step mom knows that she\u2019s done all the hard work that a mom would have done, and that she\u2019s still not mom to you. That\u2019s hard, but it\u2019s true. She never will be. But she can be your family, and you can love her, not for what she isn\u2019t, but what she is. \n\nI guess this is a conflict with your dad, who\u2019s an AH for pushing you to call her mom. But you and she get a pass. NAH, except your dad.", "NTA- she isn\u2019t your mother. She\u2019s your stepmother and the title should be because you want it, not because she has the image of a stepford wife with 2.4 kids in her head.", "Nta. She quite literally is your stepmom. Please don\u2019t feel guilt for expressing how you feel and not allowing anyone to pressure you into acting differently. That \u201churt\u201d look and these feelings of wanting more from you may never go away, learn to ignore it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Also, this is coming from a person who had a step mom for probably around 10 years and always called her by her first name. I do remember them asking why I didn't call her mom, but I didn't understand why they wanted that since I had a mom. I guess people can have multiple people they call mom if they want to, but I think the more important thing is the relationship. That's where the heart to heart comes in.

It seems that the feeling on your side is not the issue here, just the expected awkwardness when you first start doing it. So, if you really feel like it - don't shy away from the moment, don't make it as a side-note word. Next time you gather for some nice big family event - a birthday, anniversary, holiday - tell her \"Thank you for your care, mom. I love you.\" It will be cheesy and heart warming instead of awkward.

All kids hear their parents call eachother by their first names so that is normal, but you were probably not encouraged from the beginning to call your step mother mom because it was sensitive to your dad who was grieving for your bio mom. Now that is no longer an issue for your parents and it seems to mean a lot to her you could just try as it seems not something that feels inappropriate/wrong to you but just unfamiliar.", "What about calling her something like \u201cmama Julie\u201d or whatever her name is?
