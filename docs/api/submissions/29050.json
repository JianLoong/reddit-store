I\u2019ve been working with this mother since I was 20 and she never had complaints about me and for fact her kids did love me that\u2019s why I stayed with her for 2 years.   \nI have a friend who was asking me what is it like to work with children I said it is fine not great but not bad. Children can be tiring you just have to control yourself and don\u2019t let tantrums get under your skin it is gonna be fine. And cited that even though I am a person who don\u2019t generally love children but still had the job for 2 years with 0 complaints is a proof of that, I know how to deal with kids and how to throw away my personal feelings when it comes to work. I told my friend that through text and I was just giving her my raw experience and opinion.  \nNow two weeks I was at the lady\u2019s house and I left my phone charging but got notifications from the said friend. The lady was still home and noticed my phone getting bombard with notifications so she for some reason opened it and I guess she knew the pin code because I sometimes give the kids my phone to play a little bit. She took screenshots from the chat and airdropped them to herself then left. I didn\u2019t realize that until my duty was finished and I went home seeing that she didn\u2019t send me the payment yet. I waited till it was late then I texted her but she sent me the screenshots saying that I am an awful human being who hate her children and I don\u2019t deserve money and she doesn\u2019t wanna see me in the house again.  \nI already found a new job but my friend told me I should report the lady for refusing to pay me specially that she waited to fire me after I finished work to benefit from my presence as much as she could and also no where did I say I hated her children specifically or do anything to them neither can she prove it over the course of 2 years cause it never happened.", "created_utc": 1697478624, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/179c1y6/wibta_if_i_reported_the_woman_who_refused_to_pay/", "score": 31, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
