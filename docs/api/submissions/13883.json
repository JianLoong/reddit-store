{"id": 13883, "submission_id": "12ai7ra", "title": "AITA for telling everyone to get out of my house?", "selftext": "I have 3 kids (14,13,9), a husband and my MIL also moved in recently due to old age and not having a retirement fund. I got along really well with my MIL prior to her moving in. Since she has moved in, not a single person in this house outside of me does jack shit. My MIL is always consuming everyone's attention. Say for instance if my daughter is doing the dishes, MIL will call for her from the other room to go paint nails. If my husband is doing something around the house she will ask him to run to the store for/with her and they are gone for hours because they end up getting brunch and whatever. She does the same thing with my boys as well. If they are doing anything at all that doesn't involve MIL, she will automatically just ask them to come play cards with her. I've approached the conversation one to many times about the fact that I'm tired of this because I'm not the ONLY one who is doing any cleaning whatsoever when there's 6 people who live here. MILs way of \"helping out\" was to start trying to take over cooking dinner and she is an absolute atrocious cook and puts an overwhelming amount of hot sauce in everything so that didn't help at all. I had to make a second meal just so my kids would eat. \n\nI brought the topic up with my husband again on Friday because I was really past my limit. I told him that him and the kids need to stop doing everything MIL wants and help with the housework because it's not fair that I'm cleaning up after 6 people. He said things would be different once everything was settled down (she only just moved in a couple weeks ago) and said he would be more diligent in helping and getting the kids to help too. However, Sunday rolls around and every single person here is watching me clean and every single one of them walked right by me. Bonus points for the fact that they were putting dishes in the sink versus clean them (I just cleaned all of them) or walking through my pile of dirt or walking on a freshly mopped floor. I lost my shit. They were all sitting in the living room watching a movie with MIL and I told them all to leave, immediately. Go find something to do outside of this house so I'm not continuously cleaning up filth that they create. My husband immediately jumps up and starts apologizing and trying to help me; same with the kids. I told them it was too late for that and they need to leave. My husband and kids are actually fully understanding, have apologized to me since and actually surprised me with flowers and a sparkling clean kitchen/bathroom this morning. My MIL on the other hand is saying I was \"out of line\" for \"purposely making everyone feel like second class citizens in their own home versus just use my words like a big girl\". AITA?\n\nETA: before anyone asks, I have spoken to MIL prior to this about her needing to stop asking for my kids or husband to dote on her when they are doing their chores. She said something to the affect of \"they can always do them later, time is precious and I won't be here much longer\".", "created_utc": 1680523327, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ai7ra/aita_for_telling_everyone_to_get_out_of_my_house/", "score": 75, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's gotta be a rough transition. But that does not excuse the manipulative power struggle she's introduced and how she's undermining you. You're NTA for having a predictable reaction to that behavior and for frankly being extraordinarily patient about tolerating it for weeks. Still, maybe looking at it from her pov can provide some insight on how to move forward? If she and your husband can manage an honest candid conversation about what she wants to accomplish with this next chapter of life and how she envisions fitting into the household's original dynamic without disrupting it, maybe there's room to find a compromise you all can live happily with. \n\nOr maybe not. In which case, I think you'd be well within your rights to be firm that MIL needs to make whole new arrangements for her golden years.

What if you set aside a particular time (or amount of time) each day for picking up the house and doing dishes, etc., and a little longer on days off for deeper cleaning, food prep, etc. She can't change the schedule; no compromise. This is obviously a turf war, but if MIL gets all the power she wants the whole household will fall apart. Maybe she's trying (in a horrible way) to establish herself as part of the household. I wouldn't give in to her, but a firm schedule might also wind up giving her a chance to feel like she's not just a guest. Anyway, the house wouldn't be all your problem."]}
