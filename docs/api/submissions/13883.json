{"id": 13883, "submission_id": "12ai7ra", "title": "AITA for telling everyone to get out of my house?", "selftext": "I have 3 kids (14,13,9), a husband and my MIL also moved in recently due to old age and not having a retirement fund. I got along really well with my MIL prior to her moving in. Since she has moved in, not a single person in this house outside of me does jack shit. My MIL is always consuming everyone's attention. Say for instance if my daughter is doing the dishes, MIL will call for her from the other room to go paint nails. If my husband is doing something around the house she will ask him to run to the store for/with her and they are gone for hours because they end up getting brunch and whatever. She does the same thing with my boys as well. If they are doing anything at all that doesn't involve MIL, she will automatically just ask them to come play cards with her. I've approached the conversation one to many times about the fact that I'm tired of this because I'm not the ONLY one who is doing any cleaning whatsoever when there's 6 people who live here. MILs way of \"helping out\" was to start trying to take over cooking dinner and she is an absolute atrocious cook and puts an overwhelming amount of hot sauce in everything so that didn't help at all. I had to make a second meal just so my kids would eat. \n\nI brought the topic up with my husband again on Friday because I was really past my limit. I told him that him and the kids need to stop doing everything MIL wants and help with the housework because it's not fair that I'm cleaning up after 6 people. He said things would be different once everything was settled down (she only just moved in a couple weeks ago) and said he would be more diligent in helping and getting the kids to help too. However, Sunday rolls around and every single person here is watching me clean and every single one of them walked right by me. Bonus points for the fact that they were putting dishes in the sink versus clean them (I just cleaned all of them) or walking through my pile of dirt or walking on a freshly mopped floor. I lost my shit. They were all sitting in the living room watching a movie with MIL and I told them all to leave, immediately. Go find something to do outside of this house so I'm not continuously cleaning up filth that they create. My husband immediately jumps up and starts apologizing and trying to help me; same with the kids. I told them it was too late for that and they need to leave. My husband and kids are actually fully understanding, have apologized to me since and actually surprised me with flowers and a sparkling clean kitchen/bathroom this morning. My MIL on the other hand is saying I was \"out of line\" for \"purposely making everyone feel like second class citizens in their own home versus just use my words like a big girl\". AITA?\n\nETA: before anyone asks, I have spoken to MIL prior to this about her needing to stop asking for my kids or husband to dote on her when they are doing their chores. She said something to the affect of \"they can always do them later, time is precious and I won't be here much longer\".", "created_utc": 1680523327, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ai7ra/aita_for_telling_everyone_to_get_out_of_my_house/", "score": 443, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The \"new\" will also wear off soon and she'll just become another person in the house.", ">\"She needs to go. You aren't her retirement plan\"\n\nBut they clearly *are* her retirement plan. NTA, at all, but tbh I think OP is enabling this by picking up slack for everyone else. She needs to stop cleaning and let the kids either eat MIL's cooking or figure out something for themselves.", "\u201cI Won\u2019t be here much longer\u201d yeah huh \u2026 it\u2019s gonna be a lot shorter than you think if you keep this attitude up MIL!", "My local nextdoor also arranges for walking groups or volunteer gardening opportunities.", "I second this - I assume Grandma is new to your area, so finding a local senior center or a list of locally available classes so she is getting out of the house and meeting new people is rather key.\n\nLibraries often have book groups, mine has tai chi classes as well. Our local senior center has game times, zumba, yoga, and tax prep among other activities. She can volunteer for local historical societies, art associations, libraries, or museums. There are many activities that can get her out of the house and the burden of entertaining her will fall, rightly, on her and others she meets. In some areas, joining a church or synagogue introduces folks to others and allows them to be more social (It's really why back in the day people were \"more\" religious, because being a member of a congregation gave you a social group).\n\nMy local nextdoor also arranges for walking groups or volunteer gardening opportunities.", "Exactly - My first thought was also having the family adopt the phrase \u201cas soon as I\u2019m done with X\u201d. They get priorities done first, then they get quality time. Grandma may not be there forever, but for now she will be there in 5 minutes. And hey, if she chips in with some chores then maybe they\u2019ll get done faster.", "LMAO", "As a petty person this would be the first thing I'll do. I won't even bother cooking another meal as well after the horrible meal the MIL made. I'll let everyone eat that shit while making my own food. OP is too tolerant.", "This is entirely backwards. It should not be on the children to be stuck in the middle between mom and grandma giving contradictory orders/requests as they vie for control of the household.  OP needs to deal with this between herself, husband, and MIL and ONLY if kids continue to slack after say anything to them.  It sounds like the kids were doing their chores before and it\u2019s entirely a MIL/grandma problem.", "Family not only doesn't get in the way but offers to pitch in. Guests leave.", ">But they clearly are her retirement plan. \n\nAh, I should have said: \"You never agreed to be the MIL's retirement plan.\"\n\nFair point.", ">My local nextdoor also arranges for walking groups or volunteer gardening opportunities.\n\nSorry, I'm confused. Did you reply to the wrong post or am  I just missing your meaning?"]}
