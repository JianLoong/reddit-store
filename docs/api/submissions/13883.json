I got along really well with my MIL prior to her moving in. Since she has moved in, not a single person in this house outside of me does jack shit. My MIL is always consuming everyone's attention. Say for instance if my daughter is doing the dishes, MIL will call for her from the other room to go paint nails. If my husband is doing something around the house she will ask him to run to the store for/with her and they are gone for hours because they end up getting brunch and whatever. She does the same thing with my boys as well. If they are doing anything at all that doesn't involve MIL, she will automatically just ask them to come play cards with her. I've approached the conversation one to many times about the fact that I'm tired of this because I'm not the ONLY one who is doing any cleaning whatsoever when there's 6 people who live here. MILs way of \"helping out\" was to start trying to take over cooking dinner and she is an absolute atrocious cook and puts an overwhelming amount of hot sauce in everything so that didn't help at all. I had to make a second meal just so my kids would eat. \n\nI brought the topic up with my husband again on Friday because I was really past my limit. I told him that him and the kids need to stop doing everything MIL wants and help with the housework because it's not fair that I'm cleaning up after 6 people. He said things would be different once everything was settled down (she only just moved in a couple weeks ago) and said he would be more diligent in helping and getting the kids to help too. However, Sunday rolls around and every single person here is watching me clean and every single one of them walked right by me. Bonus points for the fact that they were putting dishes in the sink versus clean them (I just cleaned all of them) or walking through my pile of dirt or walking on a freshly mopped floor. I lost my shit. They were all sitting in the living room watching a movie with MIL and I told them all to leave, immediately. Go find something to do outside of this house so I'm not continuously cleaning up filth that they create. My husband immediately jumps up and starts apologizing and trying to help me; same with the kids. I told them it was too late for that and they need to leave. My husband and kids are actually fully understanding, have apologized to me since and actually surprised me with flowers and a sparkling clean kitchen/bathroom this morning. My MIL on the other hand is saying I was \"out of line\" for \"purposely making everyone feel like second class citizens in their own home versus just use my words like a big girl\". AITA?\n\nETA: before anyone asks, I have spoken to MIL prior to this about her needing to stop asking for my kids or husband to dote on her when they are doing their chores. She said something to the affect of \"they can always do them later, time is precious and I won't be here much longer\".", "created_utc": 1680523327, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ai7ra/aita_for_telling_everyone_to_get_out_of_my_house/", "score": 2593, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

From planning ALL our holidays around them and special occasions to making my SO feel guilty that they couldn't spend every weekend over at their home, that was the excuse. \"They are old, and Grandpa says he just knows this is his last christmas/birthday/anniversary/Easter/Sunday.\" For us, the past 3 were a blessing as we could finally plan all of our holidays the way we wanted to because the grandparents didn't want anyone at their house due to them not wanting to catch any cooties. Long story short,  we put up and catered to that way of thinking for 20 damn years. Grandpa passed a year ago from old age at 98. So since his late 70s, we were told the \"this is my last holiday\" as a way to guilt us into spending every single special occasion over there instead of with other family members. In the meantime, we have missed special occasions with other much younger family members who have passed and some that are still here, but their health is so bad we can't actually enjoy the time we have with them. \n\nI hold a TON of resentment towards my inlaws for this. My SO has been able to let some of it go over the past few yrs because we have been able to plan our own things since March of 2020 and because it's their mom that was creating the guilt.
