It\u2019s not your job to entertain and/or house them. Not your circus, not your monkeys OP.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't kick them out. They moved out because they thought they had found a better living arrangement. You can't be expected to leave their room unused for an indefinite period of time just in case. \n\nHonestly, it might be best for everyone if they stay in a slightly uncomfortable situation as it will encourage them to get independent more quickly.\n\nAnd anyone who says you didn't 'treat them properly' when you were housing them for free is welcome to give them a roof over their heads.", "NTA You're not being petty. You've been very kind. You rearranged your home to accomodate them. So you put everything back after they had left. What else were you supposed to do?", "NTA. They can't just hop around from house to house because someone told them to get a job considering that's what they're here for to get jobs.", "NTA - You are not running an on-demand flop house for moochers, nor are you the local guide and tour agency.  They are there to work--they should be putting all their time and energy into finding jobs.  You and your partner are busy earning a living and were kind enough to provide food and shelter, you certainly didn't owe nights out on the town out of your own pockets.  Keep the rooms empty and the door closed.  If they don't like having to live with those who expect them to do what they are there for, they are free to go find other residence with more congenial people.  And anyone who gives you grief about that is welcome to take them in!", "LMAO how on earth are you petty? They sound super ungrateful, and anyone badmouthing you for not taking them out when you literally provided free housing for them? Since those people want to chime in, they can house the ungrateful cousins.\n\nNTA", "Nta after they leave it makes sense to restore your house to normal. You gave up your home for 3 weeks to your cousins, that is more than most would.", "You're NTA. They are showing a stunning lack of gratitude. You provide them a free hotel for three weeks.

Time for another branch of the family to step up. If being ask about the job hunt bothers them. Makes you wonder how hard they are looking.", "NTA. The cousins are also in the country on a work visa.

If they want to go out, then they can take themselves out. If the rest of the family wants to say you didn't house the girls right, that's fine, they can demonstrate by taking the girls in and doing it themselves. And if the cousins don't move on getting work, they can screw up their immigration, so they better get their butts in gear.", "It's a stretch for anyone to say that. It is your house, and you didn't need the beds after they left, so it makes sense that you restored the rooms back to how they were. \n\nEveryone who is saying this should offer to house the cousins. If you really want to be petty, you could say those people are badmouthing you for the sole reason that they do not want to house the cousins.", "NTA. Choosy beggars are always an issue. We have a lot of Ukrainian refugees being helped by a lot of family as we are Ukrainian Americans and it\u2019s staggering how entitled some of them can be. \n  \nI get that everyone wants a comfortable life but you wouldn\u2019t believe some of the requests they make. They want their sponsors to provide them with rent, vehicles, private school for their children, etc. Not all, mind you but many of them are this way to some degree. \n  \nYour cousins should be happy that they are being given some place to stay, regardless if it\u2019s the most relaxed and comfortable. As someone who watched my parents work their way out of poverty through hard work and sacrifice, I can\u2019t stand when people want to live off handouts. It\u2019s one thing to get an helping hand when you need it, but if someone just wants to laze about and be taken care of, F that.", "At the family gathering, did anybody asked them about their job search? They should, that's the reason these girls are there. They should be too busy for sightseeing and going places.\n\nNTA, and you may consider a home renovation, start from the spare bedrooms, and do the work yourself (like a couple of hours during your free day).

The business about them applying for work may be true but the intention probably combined their finding work and living rent free.  \n\nYou took the request to help them as a temporary help when they were looking for ling term support.   Were the negative comments about them having to share a room and being lonely coming from their parents?", "NTA - they made their choice, you kicked no one out.
