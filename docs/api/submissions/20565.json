What does dropping a book have to do with anything? Is that a punishable offense? He should want you to share space with him at this point. Maybe move on", "Ummmmm WUT? \n\nY\u2019all need to break up. You got mad because you dropped your book between the bed and wall and it *caused this mess* .

Your relationship needs to stand on its own, not in comparison to his past.\n\nYou moved into his parents' house because you needed a place to stay, not because you and your boyfriend decided to take that step in your relationship.  You aren't living with him. His parents are letting you crash at their place, and he's letting you sleep with him.", "NTA, who TF tries to send someone their own age to another room to think about consequences?

It\u2019s not your space nor his space\u2026 it is his parents\u2019 space because it is their home. It\u2019s a bit odd to me that they keep offering to house their grown son and his girlfriends, but apparently that is their choice.

This dudes lack of respect and controlling behavior is a giant \ud83d\udea9\n\nAnd am I to understand that he put you in another room until you learn your place??! I am petty enough to say 'thank you!' and unpack all my stuff there, and go about my life until he can discuss things like a reasonable adult. If you can't do that, your bags are packed and ready to go.... to a better future without him.
