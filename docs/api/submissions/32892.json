You don't have to do those things, of course. It's a totally justifiable hole of butt that you'd be - still, if it weren't you, you would probably be more objective about it.\n\nNormally, when someone passes, people try to honor their wishes. Whether there's a will or not, it's one of those things we just do, right? But in this case you'd be giving false peace but utterly ignoring the mother's wishes, which ultimately comes down to guaranteeing a level of care for her sons that she does not expect anyone else outside the family to provide. Has there been research and a discussion into other methods? Would \"government care\" be an assurance to quality of care? I presume government care is a \"free\" option in this case... what about inheritance? If there is inheritance, is the intention to claim all of it on behalf of the brothers and then keep it as \"repayment\" for the stuff you said was done to you (which is really the responsibility of the mother to not rein that in) and throw them at taxpayers and say \"They're your problem now, suckers!\"\n\nMeanwhile, cool, you're going for a criminal law degree. This has nothing to do with BTA but do you live in a country where they do background checks? What about ethical codes? Could a post like this be found and come back to bite you?

Start talking to a social worker now to discuss what kind of care they'll need so you can plan for a transition *before* your mom is no longer able to care for them.

I know you don\u2019t want her to stress, but it is borderline disrespectful to her to lie to her about how her kids will be taken care of. On that subject. You\u2019ve stated that you don\u2019t give enough of a shit about them to fund them, so how are you going to pay for this facility? Is it with money that your mom is leaving with you by any chance? I don\u2019t mean this personally, bc I understand your brothers treated you horribly and that it feels unfair that they were always given passes and disrespected you consistently. But would this decision be influenced by the amount you get in inheritance by any chance? Because I feel like if you don\u2019t take care of your siblings your mom probably will change the amount she leaves to you in her will as she would probably give you more in terms of expenses(which would make sense bc you would need it to care for them). You are NOT in any way to obligated to take care of your siblings, especially with the way they treated you. BUT you should still leave your mom with the option on how she wants to set up alternatives for how they are taken care of. She might choose a care facility, but she may also want your brothers to have more of a free life. In addition to this there are a lot of programs for Autistic adults to get them jobs, more acclimated to everyday life, etc. On top of that they can go to behavioral therapy to adjust the way they interact with people/treat people. Give these options to your mom. But let her choose and give your brothers their options in terms of care she can give. Let her know that you gave up a lot, dealt a lot growing up with them as siblings, and while they are family, you still need and deserve a chance to live your own life, be happy, be successful without having to take care of kids you didn\u2019t choose to have. YWBTA IF you lie. NTA if you are honest. And I say this very softly, because you have a right to be angry. But, if you are making the decisions so your siblings can essentially \u2018disappear from your life\u2019 and \u2018public view\u2019 then you are making the choice out revenge, not out of care for your mother\u2019s stress. And by doing that, you are embodying a lot of beliefs people have about autistic people. That if they can\u2019t fit in they deserve to be locked away. If and how they change is both your mother and their problem. But the right to live their life shouldn\u2019t be your choice. It should be theirs, they can choose to take whatever options your mom offers or refuse, the consequences of accepting or denying those options are on them, NOT you. Sorry if this came across a bit harsh, but I hope this helps? \n\n\nTLDR: YWBTA if you lied, you should be honest with your mom about your own needs and give her the choice to decide. You should reflect on what your true motivations for this are, and consider how much your decision actually benefits your mom versus you.", "Let her stress. She never protected you from them, why should you protect her?", "Well she should have thought about that before she enabled their shitty behaviour", "Ask her if she genuinely wants her only child who might have a chance of a happy, independent life to be as stressed, miserable and have the same life. Definitely NTA and say that you'll do \"what's best for them\" once she's passed, which is to be with people who are equipped and trained to handle their needs.", "Honestly, I don't think there's a way to get her to not stress about them. It sounds like she's formed her entire identity around them, and they're awful, so she's going to stress and refuse to do what would be best for them. I don't think lying would reduce her stress, but it might turn it toward her stressing about trying to get you to spend more time with them so you're closer and they're more comfortable being cared for by you. Is that something you want to have happen? \n\nI know you want your mom to rest, but she's still making her own choices, and you can't force or manipulate her into making different ones. You're NTA, but I think lying would only blow up in your face", "You are absolutely doing the opposite of what she wants. How dare you take her choices from her. I guarantee she would forgive you not wanting to care for them, but lying to her is unforgivable. I have spent every hour for the last 20 years taking care of three autistic children. It is not a burden, it\u2019s my life\u2019s joy!!! It\u2019s hard as Fuck, but it\u2019s everything to me. I would HATE my daughter for robbing me of the chance to find them suitable care. I would spend my entire afterlife in hell, because watching my sons be left to rot would be HELL.", "Plenty of time to move", "Yes! Exactly. It\u2019s so cruel.", "Yessssssssss!!!!!! Thank you. I\u2019m literally sobbing!! I\u2019m a ASD mom of three and I genuinely can\u2019t think of anything that scares me more or sounds more horrible. I\u2019m literally shaking knowing her mother has no clue that her daughter is plotting this behind her back."]}
