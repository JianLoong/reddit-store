You don't have to do those things, of course. It's a totally justifiable hole of butt that you'd be - still, if it weren't you, you would probably be more objective about it.\n\nNormally, when someone passes, people try to honor their wishes. Whether there's a will or not, it's one of those things we just do, right? But in this case you'd be giving false peace but utterly ignoring the mother's wishes, which ultimately comes down to guaranteeing a level of care for her sons that she does not expect anyone else outside the family to provide. Has there been research and a discussion into other methods? Would \"government care\" be an assurance to quality of care? I presume government care is a \"free\" option in this case... what about inheritance? If there is inheritance, is the intention to claim all of it on behalf of the brothers and then keep it as \"repayment\" for the stuff you said was done to you (which is really the responsibility of the mother to not rein that in) and throw them at taxpayers and say \"They're your problem now, suckers!\"\n\nMeanwhile, cool, you're going for a criminal law degree. This has nothing to do with BTA but do you live in a country where they do background checks? What about ethical codes? Could a post like this be found and come back to bite you?

I know you don\u2019t want her to stress, but it is borderline disrespectful to her to lie to her about how her kids will be taken care of. On that subject. You\u2019ve stated that you don\u2019t give enough of a shit about them to fund them, so how are you going to pay for this facility? Is it with money that your mom is leaving with you by any chance? I don\u2019t mean this personally, bc I understand your brothers treated you horribly and that it feels unfair that they were always given passes and disrespected you consistently. But would this decision be influenced by the amount you get in inheritance by any chance? Because I feel like if you don\u2019t take care of your siblings your mom probably will change the amount she leaves to you in her will as she would probably give you more in terms of expenses(which would make sense bc you would need it to care for them). You are NOT in any way to obligated to take care of your siblings, especially with the way they treated you. BUT you should still leave your mom with the option on how she wants to set up alternatives for how they are taken care of. She might choose a care facility, but she may also want your brothers to have more of a free life. In addition to this there are a lot of programs for Autistic adults to get them jobs, more acclimated to everyday life, etc. On top of that they can go to behavioral therapy to adjust the way they interact with people/treat people. Give these options to your mom. But let her choose and give your brothers their options in terms of care she can give. Let her know that you gave up a lot, dealt a lot growing up with them as siblings, and while they are family, you still need and deserve a chance to live your own life, be happy, be successful without having to take care of kids you didn\u2019t choose to have. YWBTA IF you lie. NTA if you are honest. And I say this very softly, because you have a right to be angry. But, if you are making the decisions so your siblings can essentially \u2018disappear from your life\u2019 and \u2018public view\u2019 then you are making the choice out revenge, not out of care for your mother\u2019s stress. And by doing that, you are embodying a lot of beliefs people have about autistic people. That if they can\u2019t fit in they deserve to be locked away. If and how they change is both your mother and their problem. But the right to live their life shouldn\u2019t be your choice.

Confronting these people doesn\u2019t work (And can be dangerous!) Having a frank, open, and honest conversation doesn\u2019t work. They don\u2019t have boundaries or play by the rules and social contracts other more reasonable people do. OP was horribly neglected by her mother and abused by her brothers IMO. I\u2019d lie like a rug and go low contact until mom passes, personally.", "Agree", "My parents have been pretty clear that my mooch of a sister is inheriting everything because she need the help. Worth not being the place she crashes for however many decades, so I consider this a win for both of us.", "This way mom is involved with the transition and your brothers don't take it out on you when you are gone.\n\nAlso you can better assist them if they receive the help they need", "Why? Her mother neglected her big time and allowed abusive behavior from both of them. Quite frankly if it was me I\u2019d be no contact", "I\u2019m going to go with NTA. I think people are being unrealistic about the mother\u2019s ability to make \u201cother arrangements.\u201d Long term care for two adults is extremely costly and I\u2019m guessing if it was as simple as going to a lawyer and setting up a trust for their care, the mother would have done that and would now only be asking OP to be a conservator. It sounds far more likely OP\u2019s mother expects her to step into her role of providing for her brothers financially and likely a lot of hands on daily management of their lives (and toleration of their abuse). Realistically, \u201cother arrangements\u201d that aren\u2019t her taking on this burden would be exactly what OP already has in mind.", "You have absolutely no obligation to take care of them. As another commenter mentioned, your mother is going to worry no matter what you say. \n\nHowever, I would be cautious about lying to your mother because there could come a time when she is still here, but simply unable to care for them. Then, she will expect you to honor your promise to care for them. Telling her the truth now won\u2019t make her happy, but at least she won\u2019t be blindsided down the road, and she can start making alternative arrangements now.", "I think it's her right to stress about it if that's what she wants to do. However if the reason you want to tell her \"no\" without telling her \"no\" is that she keeps pressuring you be their caregiver, or she guilt-trips you if you say \"no,\" then I think you're entitled to tell her to stop talking to you about the issue. You have the right to decline to be their caregiver and it is not immoral for you to decline to be their caregiver.", "No, that's not how it works, hon. You need to tell your mom now so she can find a solution for your brothers that she can best tolerate (which is not you taking care of them).\n\nIt's very unfair of your mother to put this burden on you. Do you have any other trustrd relatives kr family friends who would be on your side who can be their diring this conversation with your mom to both help manage her reactions and to also help with figuring out the future planning for your brothers.\n\nGood luck and have a beautiful life!", "Ok, it's great that you're worried about your mother.  Lying to her that you'll take on a responsibility that you know you're going to toss out the window the moment she's gone isn't the way to help her.\n\nYou genuinely want to help her?  Help her navigate the process of setting up care for them.", "Imagine how angry and betrayed she would feel if she knew you were considering lying about taking care of her babies. Don\u2019t do it. What a horrible thing to even consider. Just tell her the truth.", "This is not your problem. She is literally choosing to stress about them. You are not responsible for her choices and feelings.", "Since \u2026..well\u2026\u2026since Ireland", "100% she did OP wrong.  Zero argument there.\n\nThe correct response to that, however, is not 'lie to mom's face, then just throw these two into a care facility with zero warning or acclimation.'", "It sure can.  Nevertheless, when you're completely and fully aware that your interlocutor explicitly doesn't want that outcome, telling them you won't when you know you will is lying.", "Ugh. I would struggle to maintain much of a relationship with them. I say this as someone who encourages his parents to spend their money on things that bring them joy and not worry about me or my brother. We will both be fine. But, if I knew that they were intentionally favoring a sibling BECAUSE that sibling is irresponsible the basic inequity of it would just drive me crazy. \n\nAnyway, the OP is clearly NTA here.", "Yeah I'm thinking that will happen to me.  If it does I'm declining the executrix duties", "Who cares mom will be dead", "I mean, instead of sobbing, maybe actually make plans for your child with autism that doesn't rely on your children without autism \ud83d\ude44"]}
