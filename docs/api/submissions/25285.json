If he were informed then stepdaughter would've had some support beforehand yk? Instead it was a shock to both. But nothing AH about that.", "I would go NTA. But I do think it would have been better to tell the father. One, because he would have a heads up to support the daughter and, two, because even though they\u2019re divorced, he presumably would want to know if his ex wife was seriously injured.", "I\u2019m actually a bit baffled by all the N T A s here.\n\nYou waited two days to tell your stepdaughter that her mother was in a major accident?\n\nMy parents used to avoid telling me when bad things happened to \u201cprotect\u201d me. \n\nThis meant that I was in shock when my grandfather passed away when the rest of the family was prepared because they knew for days he was in the hospital. They, like you, were waiting to tell me what happened after he got better.\n\nThis mentality led to me not fully trusting my parents about anything medical. I don\u2019t believe them when it comes to health. I\u2019m terrified something is going to happen and I\u2019ll once again be the only one who didn\u2019t know it was coming, that I\u2019ll once again feel like I\u2019m surrounded by people who my family loved and trusted more than me.\n\nThis worked out this time because things went well. However, what would be worse: your stepdaughter having help to process trauma and a serious situation in real time? Or having to not only deliver the worst news possible, but also to inform her you took away any chance of her saying goodbye to her mother?\n\nI understand she\u2019s 14 and doesn\u2019t like hospitals.

He should have been told immediately so he could help the daughter understand what's going on and help her process the event as he felt appropriate. Now she's likely going to fear that something serious will happen to her mom and she won't find out until her mom dies or until it's too late for her to be helpful/provide support.

His child was very much frightened with this news that came out of the left field and he didn\u2019t have more information than her to do anything about it or try to calm and console his daughter. Would it have been better if you called him first and he told your stepdaughter? Yes! Were you an AH because you didn\u2019t? No, you were in a high stress situation and were focused on your wife.

I think the ex just wants to control the info. The only way you know for sure what the step daughter is told isn\u2019t do it yourself. If the mom was us worse condition it would make sense to talk to the ex about bringing his daughter to visit.", "I understand your side but I think you are kinda the AH - even if your wife's injuries did not seem severe and you thought everything would be ok, you never know what could be going on and how her body could react a few hours even a day later. Worse case scenario, she could have ended up passing in the hospital and her daughter would have never even known she was there until you're telling her she's gone. She should have had the chance to know right away so her and her dad could have made the decision on whether to come visit or at least speak over the phone right when it happened.

If it were life or death, you would've called everyone", "Nta", "My vote is NAH.\n\nShould you have probably told the ex first, yes, but you and your wife have had a rough couple of days. Your step-daughter is 14, not 7. I think she will understand. You are only human, and we make mistakes, especially when under the amount of pressure/stress you have been. Take a breath, and let things calm down. If you normally have a good relationship with the ex. Just sit him down, apologize for not thinking, and let him know you will do better. Maybe try to come up with a plan on how you are all comfortable if some emergency comes up again. I suggest talking with your wife once she is 100% on what is a good plan in case anything ever happens again. \n\nBest of luck", "I think the dynamic of your wife and her ex husbands coparenting relationship is an incredibly important but missing piece of information here.\n\nI\u2019m happy your wife is okay and you were able to call your step daughter with that news- but what if she wasn\u2019t? Provided he isn\u2019t insane, the other parent should\u2019ve been informed so he could\u2019ve decided if it was appropriate for the daughter to visit her mom in the hospital.", "NTA. She asked you to call her daughter and you did. Fourteen is old enough to be spoken to directly.", "Slight YTA. I couldn't imagine as a teen my mother being in a serious car accident and not finding out for *two days*. I can understand why they're upset", "NAH. I don't think you hurt anyone this time. You were able to keep her calm and everything turned out okay. However, going forward, you really should keep him aware of what's going on. \n\nWhat if your wife's injuries had been more severe than doctors first realized, or she had picked up a lethal infection in the hospital? Would it have been as good if you called and said \"she is in the hospital, has been for several days, is dying, and I didn't tell you sooner\"? \n\nIn the future, you may not have the ability to wait until Mom feels better before you call them. You should keep Ex and Daughter in the loop when it comes to emergencies, even if she's scared. It could make her feel more in control if she's at least aware of what's going on, and she should probably be getting therapy for her phobia.", "Soft YTA - your step daughter deserved to know about her mom's accident the day it happened.", "Soft YTA. I think the reason ex was upset that you didn\u2019t tell him first was because this kind of information being communicated over the phone is appropriate for adults to handle. However, for a 14 year old with trauma from hospitals, this is the kind of news about her mom that needed to be told in person. There is so much nuance to communication that isn\u2019t verbal that your stepdaughter needed in that moment that couldn\u2019t be given over the phone. You\u2019ve been in her life since she was 9 and if you two are close then you could have been there in person to comfort her. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the asshole for telling her first, but if transit time to visit her is reasonable then you should have done that. It\u2019s not like the ex wasn\u2019t going to find out anyway.", "ESH you and dad, not  wife/mom and teenager.\n\nYou should have called him sooner. He should have been more understanding.\n\nMend this broken bridge.", "YTA \n\nThere is something very strange about you and upur wife withholding the information from your wife's child. \n\nKid's bio dad is right to be pissed off at you. A 14-year-old does need to supported when getting such serious information. Telling the kid so long after the accident and having the info come from you and not her dad is kind of not good. You should have called the dad, and then he should have decided whether to bring the kid to the hospital and how to frame things for her.", "Soft YTA- Since there is a shared daughter, he should've been called to break the news to her if you were worried about her panicking. It's a stressful situation,  but your wife's daughter had the right to know.\nSounds like a fairly serious accident if it requires a multiple day stay. This wasn't just a fender bender.", "YTA you made a whole title about not telling the ex-husband but it's her daughter you didn't tell. She deserves to know her mother is in the hospital whether it be from you or her father. I don't understand all the N T A. I work in a hospital and head injuries always can go south without warning. God fordbid  but What if something worse did happen and live with her not getting closure. A quick text or call what hospital and floor wouldn't have killed you or wasted hours of ur time.", "YTA\u2026 in this scenario the other parent should have been notified adult to adult to make sure the child is also ok.", "YTA", "NTA he's not her husband, he doesn't have to be informed about a damn thing unless your wife deems it necessary. He can pound sand", "YTA\n\nYou called a 14 year old without any support in place. Her immediate support at the time is her father. That should have been the first call.\n\nIf your wife told you to call her daughter directly without any mitigating factors, then she is an AH as well. If her injury was a an obstruction in making mindful decisions then that puts it on you to have a rational head. How would you want your child to receive the news? With all of the love and support available? I bet.\n\nI don\u2019t even think the wait time matters as much as the fact that you left a teenager to deal with the fall out of a situation that EVERY available adult should have been there to support her with given an appropriate heads up.", "NTA. Sounds like ex husband is on a power trip, probably bitter and looking to start shit. It's your wife, and your wife told you to call your step child. I don't understand people saying TA. \n\n(If she's 14, and you've been married 5 years.. You've at least known her since she was like 9. That's your step kid now.)", "NAH - I\u2019m the step parent in our relationship and had something similar happen in the past. \nIt was up to the actual parent to be told, and pass it onto the kid so the other parent wasn\u2019t left in the dark and could assist with working through it.", "YTA\n\nShe\u2019s a child and you should have told her dad and let him tell her, and it\u2019s bullshit, that you waited 2 days, to even tell her.   She is innocent of what happened between her parents, and you know she took her grandmother\u2019s death hard. She\u2019s always going to remember how callous you were to her.", "Yta for waiting to tell her daughter", "Stop projecting your own trauma. Get over it big dawg.", "Soft YTA. It would have been better to tell the dad, and have him tell the daughter. It would soften the blow, and he would have been prepared to support her. In stead, his daughter probably freaked out on the phone and he had no idea why.", "No, OP is not the AH and you're dead ass wrong", "Same.  Same.  They are both assholes if the wife also agreed to this.  \n\nSee my own comment.", "No. He should have told her it was the right thing to do. Both of them are wrong. So wrong.\n\n-sincerely: an adult who had this happen to her by her parents.  Except the mother DIED unexpectedly. And found out after the death she was in the hospital but they wanted to wait till mother was better to tell anyone. \n\nDO NOT DO THIS.\n\nMy trust is broken believing my family would tell me anything.\n\nI will NEVER do this to anyone as a result.\n\nI went to therapy for years after. \n\nDO NOT DO THIS.", "\u201cCan leap to tall conclusions in a single bound!\u201d", "They share a child who is affected by this and presumably in his care when the accident happened. For that reason alone he should have been told. You knew the news would be difficult for the daughter, all the more reason for her to have her father's support.", "Wrong wrong wrong.  Op please please read my comment to you", "Worst take.", "Kid is 14, not 4. She can handle news of her mom getting temporary injuries from a car accident.", "I read it as mom didn't want her to know until she got out either, maybe I misread?", "You need to read the post. He's asking if he was an asshole for not telling the ex. He knows he fucked up not telling the daughter sooner and admitted it in the second paragraph.", "This also depends on what the ex is like and why their relationship ended/what its like now.\n\nIf the ex was abusive, then telling him that OPs wife is currently vulnerable would not be my personal preference, if I were her.\n\nIf they have an amicable parenting relationship and split because of growing apart or w/e, then yeah. OP should have told the ex that day.", "If the kid has trauma regarding hospitals and people going into them and not coming out alive\u2026 I can see why they\u2019d both want to wait until mom was out of the hospital to tell the daughter.", "I would argue against that point. Depending on the relationship between OP and his stepdaughter, such news might be better coming from the father. As co parents, the ex husband has a need to know when his ex wife is injured, at least with minor children.\n\nI'm not going to say OP is TA in this case, but I think he may have made the wrong decision.", "I think you can make the argument that OP's WIFE made the wrong decision, but I honestly think OP did the right thing with the situation he was in. \n\nWhat else was he going to do? Pick a fight with his recently hospitalized wife about the order of informing people? Go against her express wishes and call her cheating ex instead of her daughter?"]}
