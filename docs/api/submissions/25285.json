If he were informed then stepdaughter would've had some support beforehand yk? Instead it was a shock to both. But nothing AH about that.", "I would go NTA. But I do think it would have been better to tell the father. One, because he would have a heads up to support the daughter and, two, because even though they\u2019re divorced, he presumably would want to know if his ex wife was seriously injured.", "I\u2019m actually a bit baffled by all the N T A s here.\n\nYou waited two days to tell your stepdaughter that her mother was in a major accident?\n\nMy parents used to avoid telling me when bad things happened to \u201cprotect\u201d me. \n\nThis meant that I was in shock when my grandfather passed away when the rest of the family was prepared because they knew for days he was in the hospital. They, like you, were waiting to tell me what happened after he got better.\n\nThis mentality led to me not fully trusting my parents about anything medical. I don\u2019t believe them when it comes to health. I\u2019m terrified something is going to happen and I\u2019ll once again be the only one who didn\u2019t know it was coming, that I\u2019ll once again feel like I\u2019m surrounded by people who my family loved and trusted more than me.\n\nThis worked out this time because things went well. However, what would be worse: your stepdaughter having help to process trauma and a serious situation in real time? Or having to not only deliver the worst news possible, but also to inform her you took away any chance of her saying goodbye to her mother?\n\nI understand she\u2019s 14 and doesn\u2019t like hospitals.

He should have been told immediately so he could help the daughter understand what's going on and help her process the event as he felt appropriate. Now she's likely going to fear that something serious will happen to her mom and she won't find out until her mom dies or until it's too late for her to be helpful/provide support. You seriously couldn't find a spare 5 minutes to give him a call? She's not just important to you, she's got other folks who care about her and are important to her life story.", "YTA\n\nHer mom had to be hospitalized overnight - it was inconsiderate of you to withhold that information for 48 hours, it should have been disclosed either to the dad or to her immediately.\n\nAlso, the \"terrified of hospitals\" is a ridiculous excuse.

His child was very much frightened with this news that came out of the left field and he didn\u2019t have more information than her to do anything about it or try to calm and console his daughter. Would it have been better if you called him first and he told your stepdaughter? Yes! Were you an AH because you didn\u2019t? No, you were in a high stress situation and were focused on your wife.

It's your wife's job to figure out if you should call the stepdaughter or the ex-husband, it's not yours. Either she picked wrong or her ex is just an unreasonable asshole and there's a reason she didn't want you calling him but did want you calling her daughter. Either way, it's not your monkeys, not your circus. Don't think too much into it and just go with what your wife says.", "NAH. I mostly agree with your parents. You get one pass. I believe a delay gives you the most freedom to err.", "NTA - You followed your wife\u2019s direction regarding her daughter.

There is an argument she is an AH but you did what she requested so you\u2019re in the clear", "NTA. 14 is old enough to talk to directly under the circumstances.  I think the ex just wants to control the info. The only way you know for sure what the step daughter is told isn\u2019t do it yourself. If the mom was us worse condition it would make sense to talk to the ex about bringing his daughter to visit.", "I understand your side but I think you are kinda the AH - even if your wife's injuries did not seem severe and you thought everything would be ok, you never know what could be going on and how her body could react a few hours even a day later. Worse case scenario, she could have ended up passing in the hospital and her daughter would have never even known she was there until you're telling her she's gone. She should have had the chance to know right away so her and her dad could have made the decision on whether to come visit or at least speak over the phone right when it happened.  If it were me, I'd want to know the absolute soonest I could if my mom ended up in the hospital even if it doesn't seem major.", "NAH.

I disagree with commenters who suggest that because she had suffered a recent major concussion she can't be trusted on such a decision. Operating heavy machinery, maybe not\u2026 but contacting her daughter to inform her of the accident\u2026 if she's alert enough to convey her preferences on how to do that, then she's alert enough for her preferences to be followed. The ex can rage all he wants, OP doesn't answer to him.\n\nIf it was your idea, however, then\u2026 I wouldn't say you're the AH but that would be a poor decision.\n\nYou admit you should have contacted your step-daughter sooner. Presumably at that sooner point, your wife was incapacitated and so could not have indicated who to contact first.\n\nIf you tell the ex first, then you are implicitly handing him the control over when to inform his daughter. On many things that might be reasonable\u2014 if the mother is not available then the father should be the arbiter.\n\nIn this scenario, however, I think the right thing to do would be to get them both on the speakerphone and tell them at the same time. This way, neither is learning the bad news before the other, and both are equally informed and able to process the information and plan accordingly (like planning to come to the hospital, which presumably would require the ex's support to get the daughter there).\n\nSo, NTA for not telling the ex first, so long as that was per direction from the (now conscious) mother. But in retrospect you should have informed them both while the mother was still presumably incapacitated.", "NTA. You were dealing with a seriously injured wife. Nothing is more important than that.

Unless there were comments that I\u2019m missing.", "Disagree, the first question the daughter will ask and need reassurance on after that call, is that her mum is going to be OK.\nHer dad has zero information to be able to console his daughter.\n\nHer dad could sit her down and calmly explain the situation in person. Face to face. The phone call would follow.\n\nIf it was my daughter I would make sure that I had tissues, ice cream / whatever and could vlank out my day to make time for the fallout / plan a visit to the hospital.\n\nEven a separated couple should be a team when it comes to kids.", "The mom spoke to the daughter directly over the phone, the common thing the ex-husband should be in charge are insanely sexist", "Sounds like a regular AITA-advice. Thumbs up.", "This is so false I don't even know where to begin. A person with a concussion still has capacity unless they've been deemed to lack capacity by a court of law.", "She has no obligation to inform her ex-husband of anything, it's amazing how you still want the ex-husband to have control over his ex-wife. This is the subtle sexism of a ton of people.", "The ex-husband has no legal right to know this information, however the daughter does have a legal right to know", "The mother wanted him to call the daughter, so that's what he did. These comments seem to ignore the mother's wishes", "Way to infantilize a 14 year olds, teenagers are people too.", "The mother wanted the daughter to know, the ex-husband has no business knowing the medical condition of his ex-wife", "The kid had the right to know and the husband was doing what his wife wanted. The people claiming the wife lacked capacity are sexist", "How is the kid traumatized? There is zero evidence to back this up.", "Please put that in a top level comment.\n\nNAH", "None of this was thoughtless, if anything he should've called the daughter sooner. Am I the only person who thinks the daughter had a right to know immediately?", "Nonetheless he still had a right to make decisions for himself", "The mother also has the right to decide, these comments are full of sexism. The mother wanted the daughter to know, so the OP made sure the daughter knew as soon as possible.", "The ex-husband of the asshole for insisting that they tell him instead of the daughter.", "You're a huge AH here. It's his disease but you found a way to make it about you. Bravo.", "Except in this case the mother was talking to her daughter on the phone"]}
