Get out now, mate.", "NTA- 7 months in and she starts this? A slippery slope in my opinion", "NTA. It will be impossible to trust her if she lies so easily and with so little reason.\n\nShe needs to understand this. It is not cute and sooner or later she will lie to a friend or family member who knows the truth.\n\nIt is odd and bit unsettling.", "NTA. That's really weird. Here's my thing -  if you're going to lie about small stuff, how can I trust you with the bigger things? \n\nAnd her lies border on delusional IMO.", "NTA this is a big red flag like all around. it may not seem like much now but if she feels it\u2019s necessary to lie about the smallest and weirdest shit then who knows what important things she\u2019d lie about. specifically about you god forbid. i\u2019m not going to try and diagnose her or tell you to end the relationship but i would keep an eye on this specifically only because (again god forbid) it could land you in hot water in the future.", "\"White lies\" with no obvious advantage to anyone. Red flag.", "NTA - \nYou sat her aside and talked about it in private. You weren't judgmental about it. You just wanted to express your discomfort. \n\nYou handled it pretty well.", "NTA. You handled this well and voiced your concerns in a respectful manner. I would feel the same way about the little lies, its not a habit that I like either.", "This sounds like a serious mental illness and can go so fucking bad for you. Wait till she's weaved a whole web of lies that subtly implies you've been doing horrible things.", "NTA\n\nBut if I were in your spot, I'd wonder where else she lies in life and whether those lies are \"harmless\" or not? And they aren't truly harmless if they are causing you stress (as they should be because they are lies out of jealousy and in such needless things). \n\nYou haven't given an example where she is protecting someone's confidentiality or safety, so I don't see any other reason to justify the frequent lies. This makes me think it's part of who she is, ergo who you will be. Is that what you want? It doesn't seem like it to me.\n\nAt least she didn't ask you to give up the dog you got with your ex. But if she can lie about things, what if \"the dog got out\" and \"I'm so sad and miss him, but now we can get a new dog together\" becomes a possibility? I'd be afraid of that.

How are you going to explain that? She may also be lying to you about things. Are you comfortable with someone who lies regularly about your life?\n\n2 - I haven't seen this mentioned but holy cow, what a jealous streak your gf has! She is so insecure, she can't stand the thought of you having a past so she lies to strangers to feel better. I can guarantee this will not be the last thing she gets jealous over. Anything from your past will be hidden or changed or fought over because she can't stand the thought of you before you met her. Not only is it jealous and insecure, it's incredibly codependent and she's trying to force that onto you. Trying to fuse herself more permanently into your life, even the bits she wasn't in.\n\nIt's only been 7 months. When someone shows you who they are, believe them. Personally, this is just a disaster waiting to happen because she sounds like she's got some serious issues to overcome. I'd tread very carefully.", "The lies are bad enough, but her reasoning is creepy.  \n\nNTA", "NTA and take this as the red flag that it is.

You guys have been together seven months. You're talking about moving in together. You're building YOUR OWN life. She wasn't a part of your previous life, just like you weren't a part of hers.

She seems insecure about her attachment to you and you having dated people seriously in the past.", "NTA \n\nIf she is so eager to lie to complete strangers over such trivial things, you have to ask what else is she willing to lie about.\n\nA lie is a lie, no matter what color you call it.  It is also a matter of trust; you trust your partner to be honest, but seeing them lie about anything makes you question that trust.", "NTA- I say this with complete seriousness: RUN.\n\nMy brothers wife is exactly like this!

There are times when this can be incredibly important, but it feels shitty to realize you can lie well. I would sure as hell not make a habit of random meaningless lies for... reasons?

One of my jobs is serving and with the way my place of work operates customers like to strike up conversations all the time and because they\u2019re strangers I\u2019ll never see again when they ask questions about my life sometimes I just make shit up for fun cause I\u2019m bored at work and they\u2019ll never see me again so who even cares that doesnt mean I\u2019m lying to everyone else in my life or anything like that, I actually hate lying like on a serious manner to the people I love and I don\u2019t like to them.

Yes \n\nBut again I do see why this could be a red flag to some and if you don\u2019t like it then you have every right to make that boundary and tell her you don\u2019t feel comfortable with her lying about not only her past but yours as well", "NTA\n\nThis is creepy, controlling, and weird.\n\nInstead of focusing on creating new memories with you and accepting you and your past as they are, she's slowly asserting herself into memories that already exist with your ex.

He had a dog when we met who was \u201crescued from an empty field he was always chained up and was severely neglected\u201d. There was a whole story how he would walk by this poor dog a few times a week. Once his sister was over and we were playing with the dog. I mentioned how happy I was that he was rescued out of the horrible abuse situation, and how awful it was. His sister was quiet. I found out later ( like a year )that he got the dog from his mom. Yikes.\n\nAs time went on I realized how much he had misrepresented his financial situation with lies. Example he didn\u2019t own his house, he rented and his credit was trash. \n\nAs more time went on he would lie about how much work he was getting (he did independent labor) and he would coincidentally run out of work if I got extra money, like a bonus or a tax refund. We could never get ahead because every chance we had, oh no, work was slow.\n\nThen finally, we had a long, torturous breakup because he lied so much about what was going on. When really he was living with another woman (instead of staying in the shop to work on himself) and had me convinced he was suffering from debilitating depression with detailed past trauma keeping him from connecting. Spent hours taking him to different doctors and he would come out and say \u201cnope they said I didn\u2019t need medication\u201d. He didn\u2019t need it because he was fine, he just wanted to leave the relationship and was set on doing it as this long drawn out drama lie.

Abusive and unstable people mask their true intentions and behaviors until they feel they have you locked down to where you won't leave when they start acting up, so this behavior starting as you talk about moving in together makes this worse. People think that because someone was great up to a certain point, then suddenly has really negative or bizarre behavior that the behavior should be written off as a fluke or a small thing, when it's actually the opposite.\n\nThing is, some people lie about their lives to sound more interesting or curate a certain image, especially these days. My first thought was that was what she was doing, annoying and a character flaw, but mostly innocuous. But then you actually got her reasoning - wanting to feel like she's a part of your past - and the alarm bells went crazy. That's a genuinely worrying mentality to have and suggests she could have serious issues. Lying to people to make it seem like you're more serious than you are? Fabricating a life together? That's seriously controlling and insecure behavior, that she can't stand that you lived before knowing her. \n\nNot to catastrophize but as someone who has had a few people like this in my life, tread very carefully dude. She's not even in your house yet has already revealed this level of crazy. How far will this go? To whom is she willing to tell these lies? For now it's strangers, what happens when she starts telling her friends lies (probably already does), then your friends, then your families? How can you trust she isn't lying about more serious things already or will in the future? How can you trust she won't weaponize this habit against you some day, like if you try to break up with her, refuse to buy her the car she wants, do what she wants with the kids, etc?\n\nAlso I feel her response is worth mentioning, since no one seems to be. It's manipulative and also a red flag. She's calling you names, claiming you've \"blown things out of proportion\" by simply having a calm, private conversation about it, and is now sulking. So she's perfectly comfortable trying to gaslight you into thinking your the bad guy for even questioning her in a situation where she's clearly in the wrong. You should be able to have discussions about your feelings and concerns with your partner without being made the bad guy.\n\nBe very careful dude. This could be a small-ish character flaw that she can work on, or it could be the beginnings of a relationship that will ruin your life. I suggest you start talking to people you trust about this, maybe close friends or a sibling you're close to. Just let them know she has a weird habit of lying that you're trying to understand and get to the bottom of. Don't make it a huge deal in case it gets resolved and can someday be something you put behind you, but make sure people who trust you know that your gf has a pattern of fabricating entire timelines and events to create the narrative she wants, in case that gets weaponized against you some day.", "If I were you, I\u2019d question just about everything she ever told me. Now that she\u2019s been found out, keep an eye out if she does it again. If she does, she\u2019s a habitual liar and she likely will never change and you\u2019ll be wondering every time she speaks whether it\u2019s the truth or not.", "Danger, Will Robinson!\n\nHave you heard the term \u201crevisionist history\u201d? Because that\u2019s what she\u2019s doing. She\u2019s making a narrative of a past shared with you that does not exist. At some point, what if she wishes to \u201crevise\u201d your past to delete friends? Or your job/education history? A slippery slope, my friend.\n\nThese are not white lies. A white lie is \u201ca harmless or trivial lie, especially one told to avoid hurting someone\u2019s feelings\u201d. Whose feelings are being spared by her lies? Yours? Hers? The dog\u2019s? The bartender\u2019s?\n\nI have known some people who started out telling \u201cwhite lies\u201d \u2014 \u201cthat dress looks really good on you\u201d \u2014 who reached a point where, if they said the sun was shining, I would look out the window to check. What happens when the lies accumulate until no one remembers the truth? Do you want to have to keep track of her lies so you don\u2019t hurt her feelings by calling her out in front of someone? It\u2019s quite possible for this to happen. Look at George Santos (or don\u2019t, he\u2019s really disgusting).\n\nYou\u2019re NTA, OP, but you\u2019ve got some thinking to do. Make the choice that leaves you feeling comfortable with yourself. Her problems need not be your problems unless you make it that way.\n\nGood luck", "NTA - these aren\u2019t \u201clittle white lies\u201d, these are lies that are reshaping reality, to better suit her. In my own experience, this is just the beginning. \nIt starts getting tricky when have to start remembering who she told what to. Casual nonchalant lies like this always lead to bigger ones. \n\nSeven months is the time that the honeymoon period in a new relationship starts to wear off, and people start being their authentic selves.

But really stop and think hard about this.", "Don\u2019t move in together", "How you do anything is how you do everything.

Like telling the person next to you at the airport bar that you\u2019re both mime performers who met at a balloon animal convention or something. But her motivation is\u2026. Yeesh. Yikes. \n\nAlso, think of how many biographical facts she\u2019s told you about herself that might not be true! NTA.", ">She said it wasn\u2019t a big deal, that she just wanted to feel included in my previous life. And that even though my ex and I adopted my dog together, it\u2019s her dog now, and telling strangers this makes her feel better??\n\nThat is actually a rather troubling statement.\n\nEasy lying over trivial details is, on its own, kind of a red flag in my book. It makes a person look like they lie pathologically, but in this case your girlfriend of barely half a year has outright admitted she's insecure about the fact that you had a history before her. She's brushing her actions off as benign coping, but in my opinion this kind of insecurity doesn't exactly go away. It's about as likely to fester as it is to improve, because you have elements in your life that were from before, and the history/memories surrounding them are things she can't touch. So she lies to strangers, but what do you do when she starts getting pissy when people talk about the \"before times\" and she gets mad about that or gets insecure about it, do you just not talk about those?\n\nI feel you were right to put your foot down, but I'd also keep an eye on that since she clearly feels you're unreasonable for doing so. That essentially equals a situation that may as of yet be not fully resolved.\n\nNTA", "my husband did this, and I never understood why.\n\nfor me this is a huge red flag.", "NTA, but run. Run now. The specific phrasing about being involved in your previous life has trouble written allllll over it. You don't have a previous life.

That\u2019s some serious insecurity shit right there. \n\nYou need to put the brakes on this relationship. 7 months is not long enough. You are starting to see the cracks in her armour and the pathological lying is just the start.\n\nNext time she does it, call her out and correct her. Maybe some well deserved embarrassment will do her some good. But I would second guess this relationship in general, something about her is just not right.", "This sounds borderline possessive to me. Almost like trying to erase a past that already exists. I may be thinking too much into it, but referring to your dog as it being her dog now is a bit strange.", "NTA these are huge waving red flags. If she thinks nothing of lying to strangers in front of you, she's lying to you. Don't plan to move in with her. She is untrustworthy. This behaviour is bizarre. For her to say it because she wants to feel included in your former life is beyond troubling. Trust your gut. It's weird behaviour and suggests nothing good. Be careful.", "NTA - she\u2019s testing you to find your boundaries. Small lies to see if you don\u2019t push back, it will only get worse. \n\nThe next time she does this you need to correct her in front of the strangers. It will embarrass her for sure - but she is embarrassing you right now by lying. Draw a line in the sand. \n\nMy dad was like this. His lies were \u201charmless\u201d, only ever about himself. But it was humiliating to be sitting there while he did it. One time when I was older I quietly told his friends it wasn\u2019t true what he was saying  and he got so angry. But he never did it in front of me again! Lesson learned.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t a bad guy, he was very charismatic and had a lot of friends. But he was very shallow, low self esteem, and ultimately would compete with me and my sibling. Our achievements were competition to him, not something he was proud of. \n\nHe was not a great father or husband, and it all came back to that crippling insecurity he had that would trigger these small - but damaging - white lies. Damaging because they eroded the trust I had in him, and ultimately made me lose respect I had. He was very clever, attractive, funny - but it was easy to overlook all of that because I ultimately began to view him with contempt.\n\nI feel that is the future with your girlfriend. You will lose respect for her if she cannot stop the lying, and what she fears - not being an established and important presence in your life - she will create through her own insecurity.\n\nDo not allow her to lie to people in front of you. No matter how small the lie is. If she can\u2019t live with honesty, trust me in that this is not the relationship for you or for the mother of your future kids who will be embarrassed every time she opens her mouth in public. It\u2019s awful.", "NTA. As someone who just says things that sound good I kinda get where she's coming from but to be jealous of your ex is real weird, like she doesn't even hide it she's just imprinting herself in those stories.. odd", "NTA, this is very strange.", "NTA. Seeing someone you are supposed to trust lie so easily and for seemingly no reason can erode your trust. Also, she seems to be the jealous type, or at the very least very possessive if she has to make up fake history to include herself into your earlier life (and erase your history with your ex).", "This is just weird.

As in why does she feel the need to do this? \n\nI must say, it kinda sounds like she has a fantasy or something of the relationship (which in itself isn\u2019t bad) but that along with the fact that she seems to find tiny lies like these okay is a little concerning.

Being unable to accept that a partner had a life before you and trying to wash it out by pretending you were there the whole time is... Very much not healthy behaviour. Top that off with lying about it blatantly and casually is concerning to say the least.\n\nBe very, very careful and watch out.

As others have said, if lies slip off their tongue that easily, you will never know if they are being honest to you.  That is fairly bizarre behavior.", "NTA and this would be a huge red flag to me. If she's a casual liar to strangers about insignificant things, she will surely lie to you about *significant* things", "NTA This is definitely\u2026. Odd?

It\u2019s not the lies, but the reasoning and the drive to lie that I would be most concerned about, and personally, I wouldn\u2019t stick around to find out how far she would take her fabrications.", "So my husband does little white lies to strangers all the time. Like when we travel, he'll start a conversation with a local and tell them that we're thinking about moving there (we never are).\n\nThe point is, his little white lies are never about our history together or anything close to writing himself into my past relationships.\n\nI'm not concerned about his lies because they mean nothing and aren't rewriting our lives.

What else does she fabricate? Hmmmm I would find it unsettling. \n\nAnd it\u2019s also just kind of stupid, to be frank, she\u2019s setting herself up to be caught in lies. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if her coworkers and friends have noticed this\u2026the random lies that don\u2019t add up. Like, ok she tells a new bartender that place has been your regular spot for years ok\u2026harmless just weird, but it\u2019s just as easy that some other bartender or worker overheard or late says something innocuous, like \u201coh the regular, OP, is in tonight with his new gf\u2026\u201d and the lie is out. Not that it would matter or really be noticed\u2026but the point is she\u2019s obviously so comfortable doing this and is careless, that how many times have people noticed in situations where it does actually matter? Like at work? Or with friends/family? \n\nI get lying to completely strangers for convenience\u2026but the reason she\u2019s doing it just seems kinda creepy.", "Hope you see this for the huge red flag that it is", "NTA.

I'm sure you guys have talked about your childhood and your families with each other. What if she made all of it up?

We're better than the FBI.)\n\nFor me, it's the ease with which you said the lies came out. So either she's an incredibly accomplished liar who can come up with an entire story in a heartbeat, or this is a story she has been working on and preparing in her head for a while.

He said I must've forgotten it at the store, but I knew i hadn't. He fessed up to eating it 2 weeks later.

When we get comfortable, things pop up lol", "One of my sisters is a pathological liar and we can't trust her.  She lies about EVERYTHING. The weather, what she did that day, working on Christmas day, where is going.\n\nTrust and respect are the foundations of any relationship. If you can't trust her, can you have a real relationship?", "she's definitely been playing the part of the dream girl. that's part of her lying", "it\u2019s only a few months in and you really don\u2019t know her. she honestly seems a bit nuts and this would be a big red flag to me.", "OP, it's super alarming that she feels the need to rewrite your past in order to make herself part of it. That's... not how a relationship should work, and it's frankly incredibly creepy and -- I can't stress this enough -- *controlling*.\n\nIf I were you, I would be less worried about your friends/family finding out that she lies, and more worried about coming home to find that all the photos in your house now have her face pasted on top of the face of every single other person that's in the pictures with you.\n\nThe more time you spend with someone like this, the more you'll start to question your own memories and perceptions. I know that sounds crazy, but that's how it happens -- she lies effortlessly and elaborately in order to make herself a part of your reality before you ever met her, *and* she refuses to even admit that what she's doing is wrong or weird. I guarantee you that someone like this absolutely will not stop lying like this. In fact, they'll progress to bigger lies about even bigger things. It *will* get in your head after a while.", "OP, maybe that's all a lie too. Maybe I'm just being overly cautious, but I left my husband. He lied about things that he didn't have to as well. He first lied to me about his age. He made himself 1 year younger than he really was, because he thought 49 sounded better than 50 when I asked.  \n\nThen, he lied about where he was. For example, he lived very close to me in the same complex when we first started dating. He told me he was staying overnight at a medical clinic 40 miles away. Turned out, he was at home. I only knew this because we lived near a train station and I heard the same train whistle over the phone while we were talking that night that passed nearby. He denied it until I walked over to his place and confronted him. He was drunk as a skunk. \n\nOverall, though, he seemed like a wonderful person and we dated for a long time and I eventually decided to overlook that silly, petty stuff.  He had his reasons for not telling me the truth. \n\nAfter we got married, I found out that his entire persona was a lie because after we bought our first house, our marriage dissolved into emotional violence that eventually started to become physical. I left him after attempting suicide and ending up on life support for several days. The emotional abuse and drinking was only getting worse and I felt trapped and confused. I started to believe the lies he was telling me about who I was as a person. \n\nI'm not saying a little white lie here and there (depending on the reasoning) is the worst thing in the world, but look at the intentions behind why she's doing it and ask yourself if this is someone you want to live with. \n\nNTA.", "Considering normal people literally never do that, once a week seems like a lot to me", "If she\u2019s willing to lie about inconsequential things, it\u2019s more than likely she will lie about big/important things.

Eventually it will escalate and eventually once a week will turn into a few times a week. Then once a day, and perhaps you may not be able to tell if she\u2019s ever telling the truth. \n\nAnd that\u2019s just to you. Clearly the talk of moving in together has clicked something in her. She\u2019s letting her guard down a bit. So the her you got for the past 7 months may not be the real her. Just her best foot forward.", "Okay that\u2019s kinda often though", "That\u2019s one too many times. That\u2019s a pathological liar even if it\u2019s in small doses. I\u2019d be careful.", "Once a week when you\u2019re around\u2026 who knows what she\u2019s saying when you aren\u2019t", "That you know.

Had some very shitty abusive ppl in my life that started out like ops gf", "Her wanting to be a part of his past and tell lies to strangers just so it can seem more real to her is not well-adjusted behavior.", "*Jesus*, dude, how blind *are* you? Her lies aren't \"harmless.\" They are the result of two red flags: jealousy that there was anyone in your life before her and possessiveness that you could have a connection to something that does not involve her. \n\nThink about it. She rewrote history to replace your ex in the story of your rescue dog. And now a restaurant *you* like has been co-opted as an \"us\" place. My man, this is the beginning of a *Swimfan*-type stalker movie starring YOU!", "I don't think they'll be confused as much as they'll think you were cheating on your ex with her. Did you really adopt the dog with your ex or did you adopt the dog with her and then take it home to your ex? Was that bar your regular place to meet with her behind your ex's back? These will be the kinds of questions your friends and family will be asking themselves, not if she's just so messed up that she's fabricated a \"history\" with you that never took place. Because who would stay with someone acting that kind of crazy?", ">they are harmless\n\nfor now.", "You do know she\u2019s been lying about you to everyone right? In her mind you\u2019ve been together for years. She\u2019s making her own reality, she\u2019d delusional!", "I disagree about them being harmless. They bother *you*, so they are not without consequence. This behavior actually feels very unhinged to me. It is likely setting off alarm bells for you because it belies (at the very least) a deep-seated issue with your past, if not an actual mental health disorder. Definitely NTA. If you're going to continue the relationship, please at least be vigilant for any potential escalation of the behavior.", "Real powerful contribution here... /s\n\nIn all seriousness though, opinions, by definition, can't be \"wrong\". They can be misguided, or based on a different understanding than another person, but there's no right or wrong. Therefore, \"No.\" Is as useful a response as tits on a bull.\n\nEdit - had the wrong \"than\" (stupid autocorrect).", "I am close to somebody who constantly lies. He will say he did things that other people did. Anything he thought others would think were impressive. He would tell my stories to people as his own right in front of me. It was just flabbergasted.\n\n\n\nPersonally, I think life is just easier when you don't have to remember the lies you've told.", "Lies aren\u2019t harmless and it shows lack of character and morals.", "i think its because if someone is so willing to lie to strangers or even people they know and love how are they supposed to trust that they are telling the truth and not lying to them and even though they are harmless its still kind of offputting that the GF is lying about meaningless things for seemingly no reason", "It would be different if they had an inside joke a out making up funny lies about harmless things to tell strangers. That would be hilarious. That's not the case here. It's concerning behaviour because self-preservation  suggests yiu have to assume she is lying to you, too. OP should definitely not move in with her. They need to get to the bottom of the situation if they want to stay. It would be a deal breaker for me if someone involved me in their lies or told lies about me. She said she does it because she wants to feel included in OPs former life. This is so whack I would run for the hills.", "It sounds like the girl is a pathological liar, which isn\u2019t harmless. People who will lie about little, harmless things will DEFINITELY lie about big, important things.", "I read that in Morgan Freeman's voice.", "And the lies seem pretty elaborate... I mean, making up the whole backstory about the dog on the fly seems a bit much, even for a casual lie.", "Yes, this is the concern for me, too. She's rewriting herself into his history, raining aspects she doesn't like. Very dangerous road.", "This is the biggest concern. The lying is dumb but the reason behind it is not. \n\nHonestly OP, I\u2019d seriously consider if you want to keep dating her. This is a pretty big red flag. \n\nNTA.", "Yeah. At this point in the relationship her mask may be starting to slip. This is the time OP should pay attention and figure out if they truly are compatible. Not just move in at 7 months, that's too fast.", "SUPER creepy! Like future stalker if they break up kind of creepy", "Those \u201csmall\u201d lies often end up snowballing into long, elaborate lies. My SIL has started some insane stories that started small. And to relate, she\u2019ll say that her or her kids have the same problem as you. She\u2019s also always right, *especially* when she is profoundly wrong. She\u2019ll double down. The other day she told me nephew can\u2019t have watermelon because it\u2019s one of the most acidic fruits there are and he was having reflux issues. \n\nIt\u2019s exhausting and ridiculous when you can literally prove them wrong and they will still stick to their guns on it. And it\u2019s never just one white lie. It\u2019s one, then coming up with new lies to cover the first lie. Plus, like everyone else is pointing out, how will you know when they\u2019re lying to you?", "Exactly. Inside jokes that double as harmless little lies are fine but outright lies with no reason behind it ? Once a week is still too many and then you have to wonder how long it\u2019ll be before the frequency just increases", "I second this! Most relationships aren\u2019t defined by how a person is when they\u2019re with their SO but rather how they are when alone or with others. True colours show and masks slip better then !", "Nobody is saying it is good behaviour but I am saying this can just as easily be simple insecurity and folks should slow their roll.", "That would be the good outcome. The bad outcome is when people do believe her about the wrong lie.", "I don\u2019t agree with your original comment but I agree with this", "Especially if they're angry. I'd worry about the kind of lies she'd tell about OP if they ever fought. OP is NTA.", "\u201cIt was, in fact, the case\u201d", "It doesn't sound like she made up the whole back story for the dog, but used all of OP's facts and just inserted herself in place of OP's ex-girlfriend. It sounds more delusional to me, like she can't cope with not being involved in OP's life before they met for some reason.", "Yup it\u2019s exhausting to be around. You literally default to not believing a word they say. And it\u2019s hard to have a conversation or any type of relationship with that kind of person. Why would I want to talk to you when everything you say is bullshit?", "My ex would mentally abuse me in the ground just because I'd question him on one of his lies. Then he started throwing burning cigarettes at me, smashing furniture, breaking glasses, etc. \n\nThe worst part is now it's hard for me to trust what a lot of people say because I believed a lot of the stupid lies he told me, a lot of them to prove how superior he was in every subject on the face of the earth, and what an idiot I was.", "This sounds almost identical to my ex but with less gaslighting lol", "I wouldn\u2019t say this is \u201csimple insecurity\u201d. This is at best, a way for her to manipulate people around her to tell the story she has in her head, or at worst, a pathological need to insinuate herself into every aspect of his life, which is unhealthy.\n\nOr maybe it is simple insecurities. I wouldn\u2019t want to stick around and find out.", "Already, if they break up, she might decide the dog belongs to her and make it a fight. I don't see any way this kind of behaviour can be passed off as \"little white lies\".", "Exactly. And she\u2019s the type that watches medical shows and then decides her children (or her) have something and at this point nobody believes any medical problem they may or may not have because she makes so much up. Having a real conversation is impossible. Trying to vent only makes you more frustrated because you catch them in more lies. They lie so much they can\u2019t even keep up with it all and at some point may even quit trying. Pathological liars are something else", "Ugh, I feel for you but yay to them being exes!", "Oh god yup. Luckily her medical issues are only with her but she constantly has something. She went to the doctor so much faking symptoms and trying to\nConvince everyone she was sick so often she actually got into legal trouble for it because she was caught lying to the pharmacist and doctors too. They decided the amount of prescriptions she was getting had to be to sell them. Nope. She just couldn\u2019t stop lying for attention. I\u2019m glad it seems to not effect my sibling much but they\u2019re still a teen so we shall see.", "That\u2019s good. My SIL manages to get banned from every doctor she goes to after a little while. She has now resorted to telling the new doctors that the previous doctor diagnosed them with xyz when she really went to the new doctor to get the diagnosis she wanted. Don\u2019t really know how that works? But yeah lol it\u2019s bad when the kids are affected by it", "Man now I want to get your SIL and my stepmom in a room together and video tape it. The lies and insane facts we\u2019d hear would be incredible. But also infuriating I\u2019m sure. Sucks that there\u2019s so many people like this.", "I\u2019ve always wondered what kind of crazy stories she\u2019d make up in a room with someone like herself that has to one up every story like that. It really does suck though. I don\u2019t know why the truth is so hard for some people"]}
