Really really strange. \nThat\u2019s not how it works. \n\nI\u2019m not exactly sure if that\u2019s a reflection of anything really, it just feels a little\u2026 obsessive, all consuming maybe? Idk. Just gives me bad vibes.", "Are you comfortable being with someone who consistently lies like that though?", "NTA - these lies may seem small now, but they should be huge red flags. Get out now, mate.", "NTA- 7 months in and she starts this? A slippery slope in my opinion", "NTA. It will be impossible to trust her if she lies so easily and with so little reason.\n\nShe needs to understand this. It is not cute and sooner or later she will lie to a friend or family member who knows the truth.\n\nIt is odd and bit unsettling.", "NTA. That's really weird. Here's my thing -  if you're going to lie about small stuff, how can I trust you with the bigger things? \n\nAnd her lies border on delusional IMO.", "NTA this is a big red flag like all around. it may not seem like much now but if she feels it\u2019s necessary to lie about the smallest and weirdest shit then who knows what important things she\u2019d lie about. specifically about you god forbid. i\u2019m not going to try and diagnose her or tell you to end the relationship but i would keep an eye on this specifically only because (again god forbid) it could land you in hot water in the future.", "\"White lies\" with no obvious advantage to anyone. Red flag.", "NTA - \nYou sat her aside and talked about it in private. You weren't judgmental about it. You just wanted to express your discomfort. \n\nYou handled it pretty well.", "NTA. You handled this well and voiced your concerns in a respectful manner. I would feel the same way about the little lies, its not a habit that I like either.", "This sounds like a serious mental illness and can go so fucking bad for you. Wait till she's weaved a whole web of lies that subtly implies you've been doing horrible things.", "NTA\n\nBut if I were in your spot, I'd wonder where else she lies in life and whether those lies are \"harmless\" or not? And they aren't truly harmless if they are causing you stress (as they should be because they are lies out of jealousy and in such needless things). \n\nYou haven't given an example where she is protecting someone's confidentiality or safety, so I don't see any other reason to justify the frequent lies. This makes me think it's part of who she is, ergo who you will be. Is that what you want? It doesn't seem like it to me.\n\nAt least she didn't ask you to give up the dog you got with your ex. But if she can lie about things, what if \"the dog got out\" and \"I'm so sad and miss him, but now we can get a new dog together\" becomes a possibility? I'd be afraid of that.

You handled that well. \nRe: her remark that it\u2019s not a big deal, if it bothers you then it is a big deal because it\u2019s indicative of how she feels about truth and honesty.  I think you need to have another discussion with her about the bigger underlying concern.   I wouldn\u2019t proceed with moving in with her until you feel heard and confident that she isn\u2019t doing this in other scenarios.", "Her trying to rewrite your past and shoehorn herself into situations she wasn't involved in is not in any way normal. I don't see this relationship going in a positive direction if this keeps up.

How are you going to explain that? She may also be lying to you about things. Are you comfortable with someone who lies regularly about your life?\n\n2 - I haven't seen this mentioned but holy cow, what a jealous streak your gf has! She is so insecure, she can't stand the thought of you having a past so she lies to strangers to feel better. I can guarantee this will not be the last thing she gets jealous over. Anything from your past will be hidden or changed or fought over because she can't stand the thought of you before you met her. Not only is it jealous and insecure, it's incredibly codependent and she's trying to force that onto you. Trying to fuse herself more permanently into your life, even the bits she wasn't in.\n\nIt's only been 7 months. When someone shows you who they are, believe them. Personally, this is just a disaster waiting to happen because she sounds like she's got some serious issues to overcome. I'd tread very carefully.", "The lies are bad enough, but her reasoning is creepy.  \n\nNTA", "NTA and take this as the red flag that it is. Hit the brakes on moving in together because if she thinks lying is something she has a right to do and pouts when called out on it, it would be very difficult to trust her.", "Creepy tbh. Borderline obsessive and probably a compulsive liar\u2026 be careful", "I\u2019ve known people who lie like this and it makes me wonder what else they lie about and tells me they are insecure.

You guys have been together seven months. You're talking about moving in together. You're building YOUR OWN life. She wasn't a part of your previous life, just like you weren't a part of hers. For her to make up these fantasies about a relationship that never existed is very troubling. What's next, you were high school sweethearts or grew up living next door to one another? \n\nDefinitely something to be wary of.", "When someone tells you who they are believe them.", "RUN", "NTA i thought she was one of those fun girls that just spins a good wild yarn to strangers for amusement but then the ex thing came in and now its all weird and not fun. Blegh. That\u2019s awkward. She seems insecure about her attachment to you and you having dated people seriously in the past.", "NTA \n\nIf she is so eager to lie to complete strangers over such trivial things, you have to ask what else is she willing to lie about.\n\nA lie is a lie, no matter what color you call it.  It is also a matter of trust; you trust your partner to be honest, but seeing them lie about anything makes you question that trust.", "NTA- I say this with complete seriousness: RUN.\n\nMy brothers wife is exactly like this!

There are times when this can be incredibly important, but it feels shitty to realize you can lie well. I would sure as hell not make a habit of random meaningless lies for... reasons? That's some Ryan Howard from the office lying to lie because they like lying. Problematic to begin with in and of itself. Dangerous in a lot of ways.", "NTA.

One of my jobs is serving and with the way my place of work operates customers like to strike up conversations all the time and because they\u2019re strangers I\u2019ll never see again when they ask questions about my life sometimes I just make shit up for fun cause I\u2019m bored at work and they\u2019ll never see me again so who even cares that doesnt mean I\u2019m lying to everyone else in my life or anything like that, I actually hate lying like on a serious manner to the people I love and I don\u2019t like to them.

Yes \n\nBut again I do see why this could be a red flag to some and if you don\u2019t like it then you have every right to make that boundary and tell her you don\u2019t feel comfortable with her lying about not only her past but yours as well", "NTA\n\nThis is creepy, controlling, and weird.\n\nInstead of focusing on creating new memories with you and accepting you and your past as they are, she's slowly asserting herself into memories that already exist with your ex.

Is this a thing that you will look back at and see it as a marinara flag? \ud83e\udd14 I guess the choice point is what your  ethical and moral standpoint is on lying?

Yes, that the lying seems so casual and easy is a big red flag. But what really bothers me is her motivation for doing it. It really seems off...creepy, obsessive, mentally unstable?

It seems highly likely that you just haven't noticed before now because you didn't know she was lying.", "Think about how easy it is for her to lie.", "She's trying to erase your past completely, little by little.

You may not think she has been lying to you, but I wouldn't trust her.", "Question. Why are you more worried about her getting caught lying (so, her feelings) than being worried about the fact your girlfriend lies about you in front of you (your feelings)?", "I\u2019d argue that blatant lies are not harmless. They show she lies easily and therefore can\u2019t be trusted. A relationship without trust is doomed.", "If she is lying to others then she is doing to you and friends/family too. \n\nMy ex started out with small lies. He said he was younger than he was. Said he had been on a trip to Disney world with his kids in the past. Stuff that made no sense to lie about.\n\nOne of the smaller problems with this is running into embarrassing situations. He had a dog when we met who was \u201crescued from an empty field he was always chained up and was severely neglected\u201d. There was a whole story how he would walk by this poor dog a few times a week. Once his sister was over and we were playing with the dog. I mentioned how happy I was that he was rescued out of the horrible abuse situation, and how awful it was. His sister was quiet. I found out later ( like a year )that he got the dog from his mom. Yikes.\n\nAs time went on I realized how much he had misrepresented his financial situation with lies. Example he didn\u2019t own his house, he rented and his credit was trash. \n\nAs more time went on he would lie about how much work he was getting (he did independent labor) and he would coincidentally run out of work if I got extra money, like a bonus or a tax refund. We could never get ahead because every chance we had, oh no, work was slow.\n\nThen finally, we had a long, torturous breakup because he lied so much about what was going on. When really he was living with another woman (instead of staying in the shop to work on himself) and had me convinced he was suffering from debilitating depression with detailed past trauma keeping him from connecting. Spent hours taking him to different doctors and he would come out and say \u201cnope they said I didn\u2019t need medication\u201d. He didn\u2019t need it because he was fine, he just wanted to leave the relationship and was set on doing it as this long drawn out drama lie. Until I found out about the girl and I was immediately gone.\n\nHe was deeply messed up and I think the lies were just a symptom of that. It is a huge red flag and the lies are usually accompanied by other behaviors."]}
