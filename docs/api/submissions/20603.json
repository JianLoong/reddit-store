Get out now, mate.", "NTA- 7 months in and she starts this? A slippery slope in my opinion", "NTA. It will be impossible to trust her if she lies so easily and with so little reason.\n\nShe needs to understand this. It is not cute and sooner or later she will lie to a friend or family member who knows the truth.\n\nIt is odd and bit unsettling.", "NTA. That's really weird. Here's my thing -  if you're going to lie about small stuff, how can I trust you with the bigger things? \n\nAnd her lies border on delusional IMO.", "NTA this is a big red flag like all around. it may not seem like much now but if she feels it\u2019s necessary to lie about the smallest and weirdest shit then who knows what important things she\u2019d lie about. specifically about you god forbid. i\u2019m not going to try and diagnose her or tell you to end the relationship but i would keep an eye on this specifically only because (again god forbid) it could land you in hot water in the future.", "\"White lies\" with no obvious advantage to anyone. Red flag.", "NTA - \nYou sat her aside and talked about it in private. You weren't judgmental about it. You just wanted to express your discomfort. \n\nYou handled it pretty well.", "NTA. You handled this well and voiced your concerns in a respectful manner. I would feel the same way about the little lies, its not a habit that I like either.", "This sounds like a serious mental illness and can go so fucking bad for you. Wait till she's weaved a whole web of lies that subtly implies you've been doing horrible things.", "NTA\n\nBut if I were in your spot, I'd wonder where else she lies in life and whether those lies are \"harmless\" or not? And they aren't truly harmless if they are causing you stress (as they should be because they are lies out of jealousy and in such needless things). \n\nYou haven't given an example where she is protecting someone's confidentiality or safety, so I don't see any other reason to justify the frequent lies. This makes me think it's part of who she is, ergo who you will be. Is that what you want? It doesn't seem like it to me.\n\nAt least she didn't ask you to give up the dog you got with your ex. But if she can lie about things, what if \"the dog got out\" and \"I'm so sad and miss him, but now we can get a new dog together\" becomes a possibility? I'd be afraid of that.

I wouldn\u2019t proceed with moving in with her until you feel heard and confident that she isn\u2019t doing this in other scenarios.", "Her trying to rewrite your past and shoehorn herself into situations she wasn't involved in is not in any way normal. I don't see this relationship going in a positive direction if this keeps up.

How are you going to explain that? She may also be lying to you about things. Are you comfortable with someone who lies regularly about your life?\n\n2 - I haven't seen this mentioned but holy cow, what a jealous streak your gf has! She is so insecure, she can't stand the thought of you having a past so she lies to strangers to feel better. I can guarantee this will not be the last thing she gets jealous over. Anything from your past will be hidden or changed or fought over because she can't stand the thought of you before you met her. Not only is it jealous and insecure, it's incredibly codependent and she's trying to force that onto you. Trying to fuse herself more permanently into your life, even the bits she wasn't in.\n\nIt's only been 7 months. When someone shows you who they are, believe them. Personally, this is just a disaster waiting to happen because she sounds like she's got some serious issues to overcome. I'd tread very carefully.", "The lies are bad enough, but her reasoning is creepy.  \n\nNTA", "NTA and take this as the red flag that it is.

You guys have been together seven months. You're talking about moving in together. You're building YOUR OWN life. She wasn't a part of your previous life, just like you weren't a part of hers.

She seems insecure about her attachment to you and you having dated people seriously in the past.", "NTA \n\nIf she is so eager to lie to complete strangers over such trivial things, you have to ask what else is she willing to lie about.\n\nA lie is a lie, no matter what color you call it.  It is also a matter of trust; you trust your partner to be honest, but seeing them lie about anything makes you question that trust.", "NTA- I say this with complete seriousness: RUN.\n\nMy brothers wife is exactly like this!

There are times when this can be incredibly important, but it feels shitty to realize you can lie well. I would sure as hell not make a habit of random meaningless lies for... reasons?

One of my jobs is serving and with the way my place of work operates customers like to strike up conversations all the time and because they\u2019re strangers I\u2019ll never see again when they ask questions about my life sometimes I just make shit up for fun cause I\u2019m bored at work and they\u2019ll never see me again so who even cares that doesnt mean I\u2019m lying to everyone else in my life or anything like that, I actually hate lying like on a serious manner to the people I love and I don\u2019t like to them.

Said he had been on a trip to Disney world with his kids in the past. Stuff that made no sense to lie about.\n\nOne of the smaller problems with this is running into embarrassing situations. He had a dog when we met who was \u201crescued from an empty field he was always chained up and was severely neglected\u201d. There was a whole story how he would walk by this poor dog a few times a week. Once his sister was over and we were playing with the dog. I mentioned how happy I was that he was rescued out of the horrible abuse situation, and how awful it was. His sister was quiet. I found out later ( like a year )that he got the dog from his mom. Yikes.\n\nAs time went on I realized how much he had misrepresented his financial situation with lies. Example he didn\u2019t own his house, he rented and his credit was trash. \n\nAs more time went on he would lie about how much work he was getting (he did independent labor) and he would coincidentally run out of work if I got extra money, like a bonus or a tax refund. We could never get ahead because every chance we had, oh no, work was slow.\n\nThen finally, we had a long, torturous breakup because he lied so much about what was going on. When really he was living with another woman (instead of staying in the shop to work on himself) and had me convinced he was suffering from debilitating depression with detailed past trauma keeping him from connecting. Spent hours taking him to different doctors and he would come out and say \u201cnope they said I didn\u2019t need medication\u201d. He didn\u2019t need it because he was fine, he just wanted to leave the relationship and was set on doing it as this long drawn out drama lie.

You also keep saying that you are scared and worried about what will happen when a friend or family member hears some of the nonsense she's saying.

A partner suddenly revealing strange or toxic behavior as the relationship gets serious is a massive red flag. Abusive and unstable people mask their true intentions and behaviors until they feel they have you locked down to where you won't leave when they start acting up, so this behavior starting as you talk about moving in together makes this worse. People think that because someone was great up to a certain point, then suddenly has really negative or bizarre behavior that the behavior should be written off as a fluke or a small thing, when it's actually the opposite.\n\nThing is, some people lie about their lives to sound more interesting or curate a certain image, especially these days. My first thought was that was what she was doing, annoying and a character flaw, but mostly innocuous. But then you actually got her reasoning - wanting to feel like she's a part of your past - and the alarm bells went crazy. That's a genuinely worrying mentality to have and suggests she could have serious issues. Lying to people to make it seem like you're more serious than you are? Fabricating a life together? That's seriously controlling and insecure behavior, that she can't stand that you lived before knowing her. \n\nNot to catastrophize but as someone who has had a few people like this in my life, tread very carefully dude. She's not even in your house yet has already revealed this level of crazy. How far will this go? To whom is she willing to tell these lies? For now it's strangers, what happens when she starts telling her friends lies (probably already does), then your friends, then your families? How can you trust she isn't lying about more serious things already or will in the future? How can you trust she won't weaponize this habit against you some day, like if you try to break up with her, refuse to buy her the car she wants, do what she wants with the kids, etc?\n\nAlso I feel her response is worth mentioning, since no one seems to be. It's manipulative and also a red flag. She's calling you names, claiming you've \"blown things out of proportion\" by simply having a calm, private conversation about it, and is now sulking. So she's perfectly comfortable trying to gaslight you into thinking your the bad guy for even questioning her in a situation where she's clearly in the wrong. You should be able to have discussions about your feelings and concerns with your partner without being made the bad guy.\n\nBe very careful dude. This could be a small-ish character flaw that she can work on, or it could be the beginnings of a relationship that will ruin your life. I suggest you start talking to people you trust about this, maybe close friends or a sibling you're close to. Just let them know she has a weird habit of lying that you're trying to understand and get to the bottom of. Don't make it a huge deal in case it gets resolved and can someday be something you put behind you, but make sure people who trust you know that your gf has a pattern of fabricating entire timelines and events to create the narrative she wants, in case that gets weaponized against you some day.", "If I were you, I\u2019d question just about everything she ever told me. Now that she\u2019s been found out, keep an eye out if she does it again.

Because that\u2019s what she\u2019s doing. She\u2019s making a narrative of a past shared with you that does not exist. At some point, what if she wishes to \u201crevise\u201d your past to delete friends? Or your job/education history? A slippery slope, my friend.\n\nThese are not white lies. A white lie is \u201ca harmless or trivial lie, especially one told to avoid hurting someone\u2019s feelings\u201d. Whose feelings are being spared by her lies? Yours? Hers? The dog\u2019s? The bartender\u2019s?\n\nI have known some people who started out telling \u201cwhite lies\u201d \u2014 \u201cthat dress looks really good on you\u201d \u2014 who reached a point where, if they said the sun was shining, I would look out the window to check. What happens when the lies accumulate until no one remembers the truth? Do you want to have to keep track of her lies so you don\u2019t hurt her feelings by calling her out in front of someone? It\u2019s quite possible for this to happen. Look at George Santos (or don\u2019t, he\u2019s really disgusting).\n\nYou\u2019re NTA, OP, but you\u2019ve got some thinking to do. Make the choice that leaves you feeling comfortable with yourself. Her problems need not be your problems unless you make it that way.\n\nGood luck", "NTA - these aren\u2019t \u201clittle white lies\u201d, these are lies that are reshaping reality, to better suit her. In my own experience, this is just the beginning. \nIt starts getting tricky when have to start remembering who she told what to. Casual nonchalant lies like this always lead to bigger ones. \n\nSeven months is the time that the honeymoon period in a new relationship starts to wear off, and people start being their authentic selves.

And that even though my ex and I adopted my dog together, it\u2019s her dog now, and telling strangers this makes her feel better??\n\nThat is actually a rather troubling statement.\n\nEasy lying over trivial details is, on its own, kind of a red flag in my book. It makes a person look like they lie pathologically, but in this case your girlfriend of barely half a year has outright admitted she's insecure about the fact that you had a history before her. She's brushing her actions off as benign coping, but in my opinion this kind of insecurity doesn't exactly go away. It's about as likely to fester as it is to improve, because you have elements in your life that were from before, and the history/memories surrounding them are things she can't touch. So she lies to strangers, but what do you do when she starts getting pissy when people talk about the \"before times\" and she gets mad about that or gets insecure about it, do you just not talk about those?\n\nI feel you were right to put your foot down, but I'd also keep an eye on that since she clearly feels you're unreasonable for doing so.

That\u2019s some serious insecurity shit right there. \n\nYou need to put the brakes on this relationship. 7 months is not long enough. You are starting to see the cracks in her armour and the pathological lying is just the start.\n\nNext time she does it, call her out and correct her. Maybe some well deserved embarrassment will do her some good. But I would second guess this relationship in general, something about her is just not right.", "This sounds borderline possessive to me. Almost like trying to erase a past that already exists. I may be thinking too much into it, but referring to your dog as it being her dog now is a bit strange.", "NTA these are huge waving red flags. If she thinks nothing of lying to strangers in front of you, she's lying to you. Don't plan to move in with her. She is untrustworthy. This behaviour is bizarre. For her to say it because she wants to feel included in your former life is beyond troubling. Trust your gut. It's weird behaviour and suggests nothing good. Be careful.", "NTA - she\u2019s testing you to find your boundaries. Small lies to see if you don\u2019t push back, it will only get worse. \n\nThe next time she does this you need to correct her in front of the strangers. It will embarrass her for sure - but she is embarrassing you right now by lying. Draw a line in the sand. \n\nMy dad was like this. His lies were \u201charmless\u201d, only ever about himself. But it was humiliating to be sitting there while he did it. One time when I was older I quietly told his friends it wasn\u2019t true what he was saying  and he got so angry. But he never did it in front of me again! Lesson learned.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t a bad guy, he was very charismatic and had a lot of friends. But he was very shallow, low self esteem, and ultimately would compete with me and my sibling. Our achievements were competition to him, not something he was proud of. \n\nHe was not a great father or husband, and it all came back to that crippling insecurity he had that would trigger these small - but damaging - white lies. Damaging because they eroded the trust I had in him, and ultimately made me lose respect I had. He was very clever, attractive, funny - but it was easy to overlook all of that because I ultimately began to view him with contempt.\n\nI feel that is the future with your girlfriend. You will lose respect for her if she cannot stop the lying, and what she fears - not being an established and important presence in your life - she will create through her own insecurity.\n\nDo not allow her to lie to people in front of you. No matter how small the lie is.

Seeing someone you are supposed to trust lie so easily and for seemingly no reason can erode your trust.

Not that it would matter or really be noticed\u2026but the point is she\u2019s obviously so comfortable doing this and is careless, that how many times have people noticed in situations where it does actually matter?

He said I must've forgotten it at the store, but I knew i hadn't. He fessed up to eating it 2 weeks later. Things that if he didn't lie about wouldn't bother me a bit, but I absolutely hate being lied to. I hope this lying thing doesn't become a bigger problem.", "Hm. It's very weird.

God forbid you have a fight and she makes up abuse that never happened. It sounds like what you represent in her life to others is a pretty big deal to her over the REAL relationship that you have with her, which should be enough if the relationship is healthy. She also doesn't care that it bothers you,\n\nThese are not just a few white lies, these are signs of extreme insecurity and most likely underneath that is further instability.

He denied it until I walked over to his place and confronted him.

He had his reasons for not telling me the truth. \n\nAfter we got married, I found out that his entire persona was a lie because after we bought our first house, our marriage dissolved into emotional violence that eventually started to become physical. I left him after attempting suicide and ending up on life support for several days. The emotional abuse and drinking was only getting worse and I felt trapped and confused.

My sister and I don\u2019t have a relationship, mostly because of her deliberately lying to try and hurt me to elevate herself in a situation, but that was really the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back after years of all the other bullshit. Now she\u2019s transferring so much of that onto her kids (so much so that she got a HUGE visible tattoo of the Autism Speaks logo\u2026even though multiple  doctors and specialists have told her that her kid is not autistic and certainly isn\u2019t \u201cseverely autistic\u201d like she claims..) and it\u2019s sickening to watch. Half of her children are already being mostly raised by my parents (both in their 60s) and I imagine within a few years the other half will too. Though, possibly not, because they\u2019re girls after all \ud83d\ude44\n\nI hope you\u2019re able to have space from your SIL. The family dynamic definitely makes dealing with someone who behaves like that so much more difficult. Especially when others in the family have been totally manipulated into believing them and keep trying to tell you things like \u201cshe just wants to be friends with you, why won\u2019t you let her??\u201d UGH!", "That was practically a ref flag for me. I dont want to do that for my future boyfriend.", "They'll have some argument in the future and he'll get a text from one of her friends: \"how could you be so mean to someone you grew up next to???\"", "Her wanting to retroactively be a part of your life before you met - there is some troubling mental issue there, you are just seeing the tip of the iceberg. Watch carefully for other signs\u2026", "u/Dangerous_Sink_374 Has she ever talked with a licensed medical professional about this behavior?\n\nIf she is not seeing a therapist then she absolutely should. There might be some unresolved trauma causing the behavior. Please encourage her to seek help. It might be something that can be easily resolved if the is willing to put in the work.\n\nYou also need to think about yourself. Those are early red flags that might be harmless but also might escalate into much worse behavior. Think about what behavior you are willing to tolerate in a partner and be willing to walk away if she crosses those lines.", "Oof. I dated someone who did this. I told him about picking wild asparagus with my dad when I was a child. His amazed response, \u201cwow, that stuff actually grows in the wild?\u201d  Three weeks later we\u2019re at a party and I hear him reminiscing about foraging for wild asparagus. Someone gave me an antique telephone glass insulator, and the next thing I knew he was telling our friends that he had been collecting them. There were other times, I\u2019ve forgotten the specifics, where he was recounting my experiences as his. It was creepy.", "This is what I thought of as well and rightfully Carol was mad at him about it.\n\nStill love that Carol was played by Steve\u2019s actual wife.  Must have been an absolute blast for them.", "Thought I'd ctrl+f for \"stalk\" before I commented to see if anyone else had brought it up.\n\nFunny thing in contrast to your comment though. I went right to \"This lady was stalking you before you hooked up\".\n\nPast stalker, future stalker, none of it is good for OP =/ Here's hoping we're wrong.", "Hopefully this thread is showing you that compulsive lying can be extremely destructive to relationships. So can calling people \"dumb\" if they are not prepared to put up with it. \n\nMaybe get some help so you can build long-term friendships etc based on honesty.", "I'm doing better now with therapy and medication. It never starts out that way where abusive people show you who they really are at first. The mask starts to slip and once you discover the truth, it's too late. I'm really hoping OP is cautious because I wouldn't want to see him where I was.", "Questionable. I assume a trained professional with a more intimate understanding of the subject would be needed to make that call.\n\nThat said, it's certainly an indicator. Someone who understands that fantasy and reality are distinct and that some fantasies *don't belong in reality* isn't likely to pretend that everyday truths are disputable.", "Ive been on a LPOTL binge recently and just listened to the episodes on Jody Arias and Casey Anthony. Not saying this is the same lol, but I can't help but feel reminded of their relationship with reality", "NTA"]}
