Your mom should just be grateful for that. I wouldn\u2019t be able to do that with my kids. There\u2019s no name that sounds like both of my grandmothers Suzanne and Therese.

We used the name from one side with the spelling from the other. Think Neal/Neilson and we used Neil (not the real name). We thought it was a nice way to connect the name to both of our families. But of course my mom was irritated that it wasn't the exact name from our side. She didn't bother trying to get me to change it (we didn't tell anyone the name until after he was born), but she dismissed it as being being just from my husband's side as if the name didn't represent my family too. (And it's not the exact name from his side either!) Whatever. Kid is grown now and I still like the name we gave him."]}
