My husband and I are expecting a beautiful little girl this year. We already have a first name picked out, and were trying to figure out what middle name could go with it. My husband's mom and my mom both have very similar names. I thought it'd be nice to give my daughter a middle name that pays homage to both of her grandmothers, so I found a name that was similar to both of theirs and my husband really liked it too. Nothing crazy, think like our moms are Leah and Leigh, so my daughter's middle name is Leanne. I told my mom this at the gender reveal, thinking she would love it, but instead she says that it's not fair she has to share a namesake with someone else, and that I should have just given my daughter her actual name as the middle name.

I think it's great you did a middle ground. Your mom is frankly acting like a spoiled b\\*\\*\\*\\*.", "NTA...I think your original idea is lovely, and hopefully so will your mother over time.

Best of luck!", "NTA\n\nYour mom seems to think that she's in some sort of competition with the other grandmother..", "NTA but don\u2019t change her name out of spite. Pick the name you and your husband like best. I think your mother should be honored. If she isn\u2019t, that\u2019s on her.", "NTA your mom is being selfish and ridiculous.

If she doesn't like it too bad.", "NTA\n\nYour mom's certainly trying to claim your daughter's middle name. It's just absurd. Your idea is a very nice and unique one as well. Your mom is the one who is being selfish.", "NTA, but agreed that you should keep the name as-is instead of changing out of spite.  Just give any future complaints your mom has on the matter the consideration they deserve - none!", "\u201cIt\u2019s not fair\u201d\u2026.like what? It\u2019s a baby name.

Congratulations on your baby!!!!", "Stick with your original decision and leave your mother time to get over herself\n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nNo good deed goes unpunished. You tried to do something nice to honor both mother figures in your life, and your mom gets jealous and wants it all for herself.", "NTA - Your mother is way out of line.  Use the name you found.  It is about what you and your husband think and it sounds like the name you picked makes you happy.  Don't do something you will regret later because you are angry with her, even if your anger is justified.", "NTA but your mom is ridiculous. We had a similar case on hand, my husband's mom and my mom's names are the same. Since I only have sons, the 2nd born got the male version of their names. They were moved to tears.", "NTA.

Your mother is being selfish and petty.", "NTA. It's your own kid, you can name her however you want. Plus, your mom saying you should have named your daughter solely after her when your MIL has just as much \"right\" to it as she does is... weird, to say the least.", "NTA. You and your husband tried to do something beautiful to honor your daughter's grandmothers, but your mom feels slighted instead. She should see the gesture for what it is and not be so self-centered about \"sharing\" the honor with your MIL.", "NTA.  No retaliation please.  Mom should try to act her age.", "NTA - your mom should be honored instead of jealous.  Let her know that if she keeps acting like this you'll just change it to Marie.

You didn\u2019t have to name her anything relating to them at all, she should be grateful.", "NTA \n\n\nAnd be hyper vigilant of her overstepping in general with the baby.", "NTA My husband and I wanted family names for all our kids. By the time we got to our daughter after having three boys we knew we were absolutely done. I loved my mother in law\u2019s name and would have wanted it for a first name but didn\u2019t want to exclude my mother. I don\u2019t like my mom\u2019s first name but love her middle name but she hates it. So my husband and I went off our family name theme and gave her a different non family first name and her middle name was after his grandmother. You did your best with a compromise and it\u2019s a shame your mom is being so terrible about it.", "IGNORE THIS I MISINTERPRETED THE POST \n\nYWBTA if you name your child after your mom with the attitude she\u2019s having about it. She\u2019s already acting entitled to your child and will only reinforce that if they are named after her. I would give your daughter her own name and use the decided middle name in homage to both grandmothers. \n\n(My daughter is named after my late nana with my MILs middle name btw so I have no qualms against naming children after important people in your life)q  DQ", "NTA and maybe you should consider a completely unrelated middle name.", "I\u2019m confused, that\u2019s what I\u2019m already doing? We picked a first name, the middle is an homage to both grandmothers. But IWBTA?", "Oh I greatly misinterpreted that the first name was your moms first name and that\u2019s why she\u2019s upset about the middle name because she wanted the entire name to reflect hers. That\u2019s my bad, I\u2019m sorry about that.", "YTA not for the name, but for calling your daughter \"beautiful\" before you've even seen her, potentially lying to us and your husband.\n\nDo better.", "Damned if you do, damned if you don't.

Take a while to make a decision about it. It is better to wait until you can think rationally about it, because it is something you will have to live with for a long time. However, it would serve your mom right if she did not have to share.\n\nThis is a bit of a red flag with mom. I hope she does not turn into one of those GMs who keeps score, and feels more entitled to \"her baby\" than everyone else.", "NTA. My middle name is just the letter L because both my grandfather\u2019s names started with L. It was a good compromise", "NTA, there's no pleasing some people", "Don\u2019t change the name out of spite, but you certainly can consider telling your mother that her terrible attitude made you think about it.  She isn\u2019t entitled to have anyone be named after her, and especially not with that attitude.\n\nNTA", "Nta\n\nYour Mom sounds like a spoiled brat who never grew up emotionally.", "NTA\n\n\nYour mom is one though. Love your idea with the names btw.

You're right, she is being ridiculous.", "NTA\n\nI would tell Mom to get on board or the middle name changes to Sue.", "NTA\n\nDont change your daughters name, the original intention was beautiful. If you change it then it just becomes her name out of spite.", "NTA\n\nI don't think it'd be a good idea to change the name out of spite....but it might be kinda funny to *tell* your mom that you will, and hang that over here head for awhile \ud83d\ude02", "NTA", "This is why you NEVER tell ANYONE the baby\u2019s name until the baby is born."]}
