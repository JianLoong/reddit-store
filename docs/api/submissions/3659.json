Even if he is here without papers the US would not send a young man back to Russia right now.", "There are tons of different paths to immigration and to acquiring a permanent status. If he's been the US since he was a baby, he probably has citizenship by now. At the very least, he has permanent residency (green card) unless something is really off. Only alternative would be for his family to be undocumented but that would be quite rare with people from Russia as it's a white country and it's too far for easy access, plus it's a country with major human rights violations so that opens up a path to refugee status as well.\n\nI would guess that the most common path for Russian immigration, besides being sponsored by a family member already in the US, would be that one of his parents got a skilled job in the US (mostly engineers and whatnot) with a work visa, which eventually gave them access to a permanent status.  There were also waves of political refugees at different times.", "I thought about either criminal background or coming from a poor family"]}
