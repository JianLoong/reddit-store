I was even yelled at in the middle of a popular theme park for \"dating a black man\" (he's not even black, he's latino, so its extra stupid they didnt even get that part right)\n\nReading this post was amusing for me. As I was reading it my thoughts were, \"Oh hey, this is why I'm estranged from certain family members. Oh she is to! Good for her.\" Lol\n\nMain difference is mine showed up at my wedding to try to talk me out of it. Jokes on them. We've been married for 11 years now and just bought our own house a few years ago. Suck it, racist losers!", "Apparently Sam is an immigrant from Russia. So just xenophobia, not racism. Makes it a TON better. /S", "OP in other posts does use the word he so looks like it's more she doesn't like the fact his family are immigrants.", "Sam is probably Jewish, guys. Samuel left Russia during a massive Jewish emigration. Everyone needs to catch on. She's trying to hide this by omission. She's looking for the internet to absolve her and make her feel not-racist. But she's an Antisemite.", "Wouldn\u2019t surprise me tbh", "YTA.\n\nWhat\u2019s wrong with Sam\u2019s background? Ultimately it doesn\u2019t matter but this post screams racism or classism.", "\"If he'd been an unemployed man with a history of domestic violence, drug taking or being an alcoholic or had 3+ relationships with children scattered behind him, I could have understood OP being concerned but that?\"\n\nActually, I'd want to keep an even closer eye on my child.  They are doing the opposite with their actions.", "Nope. Sam is probably Jewish. She's an Antisemite.", "During a period of time that aligned with massive Jewish emigration period. Mostly like antisemitism", "She said \u201chis background\u201d. If it\u2019s that he\u2019s an immigrant then that\u2019s awful. I suppose that instead (unlikely) he could be a recently released convicted murderer. But if not then they are awful.", "That was my thought. Keep them very close for when they would need me and I can make sure they\u2019re safe.", "How\u2019d you figure that? OP only said he was russian.", "OP stated he immigrated from Russia when he was a baby when asked what was wrong about Sam's background.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z9juua/aita_for_helping_and_contributing_to_my_nieces/iyh6qkg/?context=3", "My thought as well. You don't estrange yourself from your kid, you make sure you're hella involved in their life so if/when things do go wrong, you're there to catch them and help out, instead of learning about it after the fact.", "Knowing a decent amount of people who left Russia/former Soviet areas, this is a reasonable guess."]}
