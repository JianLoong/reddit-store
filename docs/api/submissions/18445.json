My school does a profile on all graduates each year (we're a small school with only 40 graduates this year so more doable).

He got pissy about it and bitched to me. My dad died when I was 7 and my stepdad has been in my life almost as long (my parents were sort of separated when dad died) as my dad has been gone. So he was annoyed to be listed as a stepdad and not as just a regular parent. I told him he was not my dad and I wanted to make sure to honor my dad. He said dad is dead and he can't see it. That it's for me and only me. I said yeah. Because I'm not going to deny it's for me. He said he might as well be nothing as far as that's concerned. I told him he was being dramatic. To cut to the chase he contacted the school two weeks ago and asked them to change it. They had to sent the final profile info to me before publishing and followed up on my stepdad being listed as dad and my dad was listed as \"late father\". They said the change was requested.
