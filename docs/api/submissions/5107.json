If she is only eating 2 meals a day while still not losing weight, she most likely isn't eating enough and her metabolism has adapted to only use that many calories since that's all it's getting. I'd also throw around wild assumptions that hair and energy levels are shit. \n\nCI must less than CO to lose weight. When you CI are so low for so long, the body can adapt to lower CO. \n\nMy unprofessional opinion based solely on being in the bodybuilding world for a few years, is to increase food little by little. And to take a solid look at stress levels and quality of sleep.\n\nAgain, wildly assuming based off what I've learned from coaches, seen and experienced.

We're so obsessed with eat less food, weigh less. There's so much more to that. Just want people to stop villianizing delicious food and eat it. They just want keto and running. You can only do so much cardio on very little calories until your body starts fighting against it.\n\nSo happy for you tho!

Metabolism can down regulate itself to preserve body if  you aren't feeding it.\n\nIf you're eating really 1200 calories a day and not losing weight, it's because you're not burning 1200 calories a day because your metabolism has adapted to only needing 1200 calories to survive. \n\nI'm not debating calories vs calories out. That's the rule. It's how energy all works, right? But the calories out part can change also. It's not a static number. So we know that most of caloric expenditure outside of voluntary exercise is through NEAT. When you aren't giving your body more than say 1000 or 1200 calories your NEAT can/will inevitably go down. Which causes your calories out to go down, to be less than or equal to your calories in. Therefore you will not lose any weight or you may actually gain weight.\n\nAnd sometimes in that situation you can gradually up your calories, and you will find that you start losing weight again. Because you're fueling your body so therefore you're moving more so therefore your metabolism kind of starts up again.", "Accept my poor man award \ud83e\udd47", "NTA\nYou did a great job, that's the unique way to shut up people like him.

Your body is probably in a state of preparing for low food intake, thus stacking up on body fat. It's a natural reaction to a limited food intake. Try eating three meals a day, 1700-2000 calories, so your body gets the fuel it needs for exercising etc. If you're already eating that many calories, try splitting that into three meals maybe? You'll probably notice a change, having more energy and maybe losing body fat, if that's important to you, but also being able to gain muscle, thus increasing what you burn in a state of no body movement.", "NTA, you're just looking out for his health after all", "NTA - Your sisters response to laugh was correct.

Hormones are a big player.  Male bodies generally respond differently to diet and exercise than female bodies.  You are right to focus on healthy eating and regular exercise.  I hope you are lifting weights under supervision because muscle mass is your friend in multiple ways.\n\nAs for Dad, he needs to get honest with himself.  You did right to have a boundary and be up front with it.  Take care of yourself.", "So ironic that on a similar post where the genders were reversed, so many were calling the dude an AH. \n\nNTA op, like I said on that post, people need to learn that even the most patient scorpion will sting if it's stepped on one too many times. Truth is a double edged sword, so people like your dad should be more cautious when they swing it.   \n\n\nAlso: him projecting his insecurities onto you is not a good reason for you to be \"nicer\" to him.
